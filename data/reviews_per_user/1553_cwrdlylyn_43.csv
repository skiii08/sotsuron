Howl's Moving Castle," HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE : Flawed But Interesting & Creatively Outlandish...
","HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE, my first Miyazaki film, is the story of shy young woman named Sofi who is turned into an old woman by the Witch of the Waste. As an old woman, Sofi leaves for the hills where she is picked up by the legendary Moving Castle. There, she meets a fire demon named Calcifer who bargains with her to help her reverse her curse if Sofi can free Calcifer from serving Howl himself.This film is an example of someone allowing their imagination to be completely free... and Miyazaki manages to bring his creativity together in a visual spectacle of a film. How cohesive the job is in the end is up for debate. At times, the story leaves too many stones unturned, or adds too many complications to keep everything clear. As a result, the emotional impact of the film is dulled b/c the audience is left unsure of what everything means... at least I was. However, this is a film that rests on the strength of it's sheer creativity.At times, the story feels so wonderfully creative that I was reminded of true classics like THE WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND. Sofi makes for a wonderful leading lady and it is a joy to follow her through this story. She changes from a gentile, shy young shop girl into a grumpy old woman... and yet she always remains a likable central presence. However, what separates this film from classics like THE WIZARD OF OZ and WONDERLAND is it's inability to be clear.Those pieces feature some of the most wildly imaginative characters and stories ever created, and yet in the end they always make complete sense and are incredibly satisfying. HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE captivated my attention the entire time, however, it never left me feeling that I was watching a concrete story arch.In addition, the central character of Calcifer is a real disappointment here. The character, voiced by an uninspired Billy Crystal, stands out as a poor animation job amidst the beautiful artistry that makes the rest of HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE so enjoyable. The character of a fire demon should have opened the doors for some wonderful artistic interpretation... but instead, Miyazaki seems to have opted for a character straight out of the 'how to create a funny/cute sidekick' guidebook. In a film so full of wonderfully out of the box creations, it is really a shame that such a central element is so boringly cliché.Otherwise, though the story definitely has loop holes and Calcifer is a huge disappointment, HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE still is an incredibly enjoyable and interesting film. It takes chances with it's imagination unlike 90% of the animated films being released today b/c it takes a refreshingly non-commercial approach (except for Calcifer). HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE is a fun, interesting film that may have some noticeable flaws... but it does deserve extra credit for reaching further then the average animated film....

Walk the Line," WALK THE LINE : Strong Film, But It Suffers From A Flawed Beginning...
","WALK THE LINEWALK THE LINE is a flawed, yet consistently engaging film. Though the movie falters at some points, there is constantly something on screen to keep the film enthralling.My main problem with WALK THE LINE came in the first 45 minutes before the entrance of June Carter. Simply, the movie feels too standard... too been there done that... and too unfocused. The first 45 minutes are spent showing us the major points in Johnny's life before June (the death of his brother, his constant love of music, his struggles in the service, etc.). Considering this is typical fair to expect from a biopic, then why was this the most disappointing part of the film? Because the quality film the director has made is not a Biopic, but a love story/2 person biopic. Johnny Cash is a fascinating man on his own, and I'm sure had a biopic been made to specifically focus solely on him there would have been a great film there. But the first 45 minutes seem to me like the director simply wants to get to the June Carter story as soon as possible.Once we get to the point of June's arrival, the movie gains a focus it hadn't had at first. It seems the director and screenwriters true passions were in telling the story of Johnny and June... and they should have realized this instead of being confused for the first 1/3 of the film about which story they are actually telling.However, this is not to say the film is faulted. The troublesome first 1/3 is indeed flawed, but still never sinks lower than a good-yet-standard biopic. And what saves the film from being severely marred by it's opening is the performance of Joaquin Pheonix.Pheonix is engaged in the role and has a focus from the get-go... even when an overall focus is missing from the film itself. Pheonix carries the first third of this film on his shoulders, and keeps it going through till the end. Ironically, the strongest part of his performance was how endearingly vulnerable he was able to make himself regardless of the terrible things he'd done.And as for Reese Witherspoon, she matches Pheonix on every level and is phenomenal as June Carter. Two reasons for the film's improvement upon her arrival are... 1.) The film finally becomes focused and all the elements come together... 2.) Her performance is just so damn magnetic.Overall, it's a great film featuring two incredible, Oscar Worthy performances. And despite the fact that it is far from perfect at first, the film sends you out of the theater on such a high that I had temporarily forgotten how disappointed I was at the start....

Unbreakable," UNBREAKABLE : Shyamalan Mixes Real Talent W. Overindulgence...
","UNBREAKABLE After his success with THE SIXTH SENSE, M. Night Shyamalan's name became a brand of sorts. In a day when director's rarely get the top billing for their films, M. Night Shyamalan has managed to build up a following strong enough to have all his films labeled 'An M. Night Shyamalan Film'. In today's day, when cinema in general has seemed kind of stagnant, it is refreshing to see a director with such a clear strong vision getting recognition. Though his films since THE SIXTH SENSE have yet to receive the unanimous praise bestowed on that thriller, they have all had the signature stamp of Shyamalan's eye.Ironically, Shyamalan's film that seemed to make the slightest dent on the public radar was his first follow-up to THE SIXTH SENSE... UNBREAKABLE. It takes his typical formula of a slowly revealed secret that is given a huge shift in the final moments of the film, and frames it as an ode to comic books. It tells the story of David Dunn (played by Bruce Willis), a man who miraculously survived a disastrous train accident unharmed while all the other passengers died.There appears to be no explanation for David's survival, and the experience cuts a huge rift in David's life. Already estranged from his wife (played by Robin Wright Penn), David seems to become even more removed from his family as he struggles to come to terms with the situation. It seems no one can provide him answers, except a man named Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson). Elijah is a man obsessed with the legacy of comic books as pieces of art, and he also suffers from a protein deficiency that causes his bones to break like glass. Elijah believes that David is a modern day 'superhero'.In his attempts to relay this belief to David, Elijah comes across as a man who has lost his mind. Yet he persistently approaches David with justification for his theory. Turns out David is not only 'unbreakable'... he also has super-strength, a desire to protect people, and impeccable instincts. Elijah continually challenges David to develop these talents and challenge himself... but David is torn between his assumption that Elijah is crazy, the promise he made his wife, and the destiny he might hold.UNBREAKABLE came out one-year after the phenomenon of THE SIXTH SENSE and although it did respectable business at the box office... it never truly caught on with the public. I can only assume it is because of how impersonal the film feels. All the characters are so incredibly introverted that the film feels lifeless at times. It is very slow moving in it's pursuit of the truth... and when David learns new things about his capabilities it is not filmed in a grand way. Everything is kept very subtle, and while that suits the realistic tone of the entire film, it hurts the films pacing.I think in this follow-up, Shyamalan showed many of the skills that made THE SIXTH SENSE so successful. There are some shots in particular that are rather captivating. For example, the opening sequence on the train is filmed in a very interesting manner that works very well as an introduction to David's character and his struggles. In addition, there is a sequence in which David's son holds him at gunpoint that is done very well. Finally, in the last moments when David finally learns to use his powers, there is a particularly chilling shot of a flowing window curtain. However, Shyamalan also becomes over-indulgent at times.There are numerous plot elements here that are granted an unreasonable amount of time whether through story development or extended sequences. For example, in the moments following David's survival of the train crash, Shyamalan takes a ridiculous amount of time. Everything moves in slow motion and in silence for a good 5 minutes and unfortunately it doesn't work. Within the first minute I understood the tension that Shyamalan was trying to capture, but by the 5th minute I was checking my watch. Also, the relationship between Bruce Willis and Robin Wright Penn is poorly done. There is a huge emotional divide between them, and a vast majority of the film focuses on them trying to work things out. However, under the surface of their performances, there is virtually no sense of an undying love.Overall, the film develops in an intriguing manner, but too much of it feels useless. I think quite a bit of footage was included because Shyamalan was looking to strengthen the mood and artistic merit of the film... but in the end the movie needed a little more of a mainstream pacing. By having the film move so incredibly slow at times, Shyamalan loses his audience at times. If the film could have been paced a bit more briskly perhaps it would have reached its full potential. However, for true fans of Shyamalan, this does make for an interesting viewing experience. Many of his talents are evident, though while riding on the success of THE SIXTH SENSE it appears Shyamalan got a little too indulgent at times.... C+ ...",6,0,0,16 June 2006
Monster," MONSTER : The Film Is The Performance, & Theron Is Brilliant
","MONSTER Watching this film proves that, despite the boredom and predictability of the Best Actress race in '04, Charlize Theron is one of the most deserving Oscar winners in recent years. It's amazing how such an average film holds up so beautifully in repeat viewings solely on the shoulders of Theron's unbelievable performance as Aileen Wournos in MONSTER.MONSTER tells the story of Wournos, a homeless street-walking loner with a grim outlook on life. Although her rage doesn't manifest itself to murder till later in the film, it is clear that Wournos' ability to live in a world with men is shaky. She holds loathing and hatred towards the men that belittled her as a child, and instead of removing herself from those situations... she has chosen to live a life where her survival depends on men's carnal desires. However, after finding happiness in a relationship with a young girl named Selby (played by Chrisina Ricci), that rage that has been simmering deep down unleashes itself in a murdering frenzy as Aileen becomes one America's first female serial killers.Virtually all of MONSTER's acclaim was focused on Charlize Theron and her startlingly good performance. And though it was certainly warranted... it should also be noted that MONSTER is a solid effort on it's own as well. It's a simple film told from a rather simple point of view. However, by remaining simple first time feature-director Patty Jenkins manages to keep the film well balanced. MONSTER never takes sides on the issue of violence, it is clear that Wournos is not justified to do what she does... but it is also clear that is not entirely her fault the her emotional state ever got to the place it was. If the film had taken sides, it would have been far less gripping. Thankfully Jenkins, with the help of Theron, manages to make this film an accurate portrait of this woman's life.Aside from Theron, the only other performance that registers in the film is that of Christina Ricci. Her's is a polarizing performance, because it's hard to tell whether the incredibly annoying aspects of her character come from Ricci's acting, or Selby's personality. Personally, I think it's a little bit of both. Nonetheless, Ricci's performance works in the context of the film... and Theron obviously has no difficulty playing opposite her.Though MONSTER is an solid film, it's clear it would have been nothing without the conviction of Charlize Theron in the leading role. Much flack has been given to the Best Actress category in recent years for being too quick to award any Hollywood actress who 'de-glams'. However, I think such a generalized criticism is unfair because it slightly taints Charlize Theron's win. Yes, she 'de-glammed' and got fat... but even without that, her performance is one of the most emotionally hypnotizing female performances I've seen in years. This film IS her performance, and she's brilliant here.... B- ...",7,7,7,13 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," POTC - DEAD MAN'S CHEST : Tons Of Fun, Even If It's Not Quite As Creative As The Original...
","PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN : DEAD MAN'S CHEST Though this blockbuster sequel fails to capture the intelligence or the overall-quality that the first film holds, DEAD MAN'S CHEST opts to take the no-holds-barred approach. In CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL, though there were many special effects and exciting moments, they all seemed to branch out of one strong storyline. In DEAD MAN'S CHEST, the plot seems to be created in order to accommodate the many different action set-pieces that the creators could come up with.That's not to say the story on hand isn't a great deal of fun or rather engrossing. DEAD MAN'S CHEST follows Jack Sparrow as he struggles to free himself of a debt he owes Davy Jones. Turns out he was promised the right to be Captain of the Black Pearl for only a certain number of years before he will be forever a member of Davy Jones' underwater crew. However, when Will Turner and Elizabeth Swann show up in an attempt to clear their names with the government, they get tangled up in Jack's plan for escaping his debt.The plot is engrossing, though not complete. However, that can be blamed on the fact that this piece is merely the first half of a two part film, to be later wrapped up with the third installment. As a single film, the plot is engrossing, but not rewarding. However, it does set up some interesting story lines that will inevitably make for an exciting final chapter in the franchise.Something about this film lacks the freshness of the original, where Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow was a complete revelation. Also, at that time the high-seas adventure hadn't been brought to the silver screen in such a way for many many years. Though the formula is more familiar this time, the creators have come up with so many thrilling special effects and action sequences that one forgets for a moment that what they are watching isn't very original.In the end, DEAD MAN'S CHEST delivers on it's promise to be one of the best times you can have at the theatre this summer. It's constantly entertaining, with the Kraken sequences and the island natives providing some of the most fun. Also, the character of Davy Jones is a visual feast. It's absolutely incredible to watch a character brought to life so realistically through CGI (only KING KONG eclipses this in quality)... and on top of that, Nighy's performance is a great deal of fun to watch. Johnny Depp still manages to ring every possible laugh out of the character of Jack Sparrow, and Keira Knightley continues to prove that she has an incredible charisma on screen.Overall, DEAD MAN'S CHEST didn't need to be 'rewarding' for me, because it kept me so thoroughly entertained for it's entire 2 1/2 hour running time. And above all things, it managed to make me a bigger fan of the successful series... someone who can't wait to see how these story lines are wrapped up and brought together in the final chapter. Sure, it's not of the same quality as the first film on many levels, but it's just as much fun. DEAD MAN'S CHEST (aside from X-MEN:THE LAST STAND) is at this point the only summer blockbuster to fully live up to it's hype for me, and that's not too shabby.... B+ ...",8,2,3,24 August 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," NARNIA : Great Children's Epic That Embraces The Original Book's Depth & Ambition...
","CHRONICLES OF NARNIA : THE LION, THE WITCH, & THE WARDROBE Back when NARNIA first came out at the beginning of the winter I saw it in the theater and was underwhelmed. I labeled it LOTR:LIGHT for a long time and was always bitter over the fact that NARNIA was beating my beloved KING KONG at the box office. If I remember correctly, I stated the film was good... but not remarkable... with slightly hollow special effects and performances (except for Tilda Swinton) and I gave the film an indifferent grade of B.However, I put in a bootleg DVD yesterday to watch it with some friends who hadn't seen it and I realized I was unfairly rough on what is actually a very well produced children's epic.On first viewing, I don't think I appreciated all the undertones featured in some of the performances, particularly James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus. I found his performance to be empty but that's because I didn't realize the darker shadings of his character that McAvoy uses from the very start. I still find the child stars to be slightly underwhelming at parts... but it's unfair to expect such young children to carry a film of this size on their shoulders flawlessly. And Tilda Swinton is still incredible.Upon second viewing, I realized the film seems slightly slower with less flashy special effects b/c in the end it doesn't need them in the same way KING KONG and LOTR did. The film emphasizes the tension of oncoming doom more so then actual confrontation and battle. I got a grander sense of the Pevensie children's destiny and found the film to be all the more engrossing because of that.Overall, I found the film to be highly entertaining and creatively brought to life... though still not remarkable (KING KONG and LOTR are still vastly superior films). This time around I didn't notice as many flaws in NARNIA. Instead I sat back and enjoyed it for what it was... a different movie aimed at an entirely different audience.It is disappointing to me that my beloved KING KONG was defeated at the Box Office by this, but even so NARNIA is one of the better 'big-budget franchise films' to come out in a long time... and so it shouldn't be faulted simply b/c it beat my favorite movie at the box office. I am definitely anxious to see CHRONICLES OF NARNIA : PRINCE CASPIAN and seeing where this franchise grows.Upon first viewing I gave the film an indifferent B... but upon second viewing, I gave the film a much more enthusiastic:...

The Notebook," THE NOTEBOOK: Above-Average Romantic Drama, But It Becomes Trite When It Tries Too Hard...
","THE NOTEBOOK Normally I avoid any movie that is overly romantic or seems especially geared towards females... no offense to those that enjoy them but for me they usually come off as annoyingly trite. However, the hoopla that revolved around THE NOTEBOOK made me curious to see what all the buzz, hype, and admiration was about.THE NOTEBOOK tells the love story of Allie and Noah... two people from opposite sides of the tracks who fall deeply in love over one summer. The story is bookended with older versions of the characters, played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands, sharing the story of their love... however, in her old age Allie has lost her memory. Noah, known as Duke when he's older, tells her their love story every day in the hopes of bringing the love of his life back to him. The idea of bookending the film with the older versions of the characters gives the film a unique approach... but in the end, for me, it just got in the way of what is a truly great love story.THE NOTEBOOK is only truly alive when it focuses on the story of their young love, played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling and the always magnetic Rachel McAdams. Though their courtship and trials are often clichéd, the romantics are elevated by the wonderful performances of these great actors. The scene in which they first fall in love walking down the streets after seeing a movie is truly wonderful.Romantics work best for me when they are played in a very honest, and believable way. As soon as contrivances and over-sentimentality creeps into the picture I become disinterested or overwhelmed. The story of their young love is grand and perhaps not completely realistic... but the performances are so honest that it manages to keep the film grounded.Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling have a dynamic chemistry together whether they are fighting, playing, joking around, or making love. Every emotion and every up-and-down of their relationship is beautifully realized. McAdams continues to impress me (has anyone seen anything besides a great, engaging performance come from her... cuz I haven't) and Gosling was great as the male lead (it helps that he's not traditionally good looking or overtly 'charming' and 'suave'). The supporting work from Joan Allen is very strong as well as Allie's overprotective, oppressive mother. Her scene with Allie in the car at the end is wonderfully played.However, despite valiant efforts from the great Gena Rowlands and James Garner... the bookends ultimately cap off the picture on a bad note. I won't give away the full ending, but something about it was just wrong. The editing and cuts in one scene especially felt incredibly awkward and out of place. And the whole situation in the end really felt far too contrived and emotionally manipulative for the audience.I'm someone who shuts down emotionally as soon as a film feels like it's trying to make me cry as opposed to just letting me go along on a genuine emotional ride. This is what ultimately hurts the movie. The manipulative aspect of the bookended structure.Still, the film is better then your average romantic drama. It has enough genuine moments to give the film some merit (all provided in the flashback portions, which thankfully make up most of the film). I can appreciate the heights that THE NOTEBOOK aspired to reach, and it truly does in some moments. But Nick Cassavettes, the film's director, should be carefully of reaching too far... b/c he makes that mistake a few times in this good, but not perfect film.... B- ...",7,0,1,23 March 2006
Madagascar," MADAGASCAR: Nothing Too Great, But Nothing Bad Either...
","MADAGASCAR I know people were really hoping this movie wouldn't make it into the 2006 shortlist for Best Animated Feature... and the nominations went to CORPSE BRIDE, W&G, and HOWL'S MOVING CASTLE. Well I won't argue that this film was robbed of a nomination, but it certainly wouldn't have been a travesty if MADAGASCAR had made the list.While not a remarkable, landmark achievement, MADAGASCAR is still an entertaining animated film. Featuring some wonderfully stylized animation and some perfect marriages of voice-actors with their characters, the film is constantly entertaining and humorous.What MADAGASCAR does lack is any significant depth. Any layer to the characters is utilized for comedy instead of played for sincerity. That is until the very end when Alex the Lion has a change of heart. But everything that precedes that treats the animal's personalities as shamelessly shallow comedic creations.Now, that doesn't do much for the film's artistic merit... but it does make for a good time. Ben Stiller, Chris Rock, Jada Pinkett-Smith, David Schwimmer, and the rest of the cast are obviously having a good time voicing these characters and the fun permeates through the screen. Their performances mixed with the stylized animation is really what keeps the film alive.It tells the story of Alex the Lion (Stiller), Marty the Zebra (Rock), Gloria the Hippo (Pinkett-Smith) and Melman the Giraffe (Schwimmer) as they are shipped back to the wild despite their affection for the Central Park Zoo. They've been zoo animals for years and aren't ready for the sudden shift to embrace their wild instincts. However, somehow they adjust and remain friends.It's a predictable story arch and it definitely starts to lag when the film tries to switch gears into more dramatic territory at the very end. The comedic addition of the Lemurs in MADAGASCAR was obviously done to appeal to young kids and get even more laughs... however, for me the Lemurs were unnecessary superfluous distractions that only made the film drag.Still, the 4 central characters are very appealing and well-voiced by the respective actors. MADAGASCAR isn't perfect, it's a movie I would never praise with love... but I also don't really have anything too negative to say. I will say that I found it better then Dreamworks' more critically acclaimed SHREK.MADAGASCAR can't be deemed any revelation... but in terms of harmless children/family entertainment this is an entertaining ride that earned the box-office success it received....

Ice Age: The Meltdown," ICE AGE - THE MELTDOWN : Genuinely Funny & Exciting In A Very Standard Way...
","ICE AGE : THE MELTDOWN In this depressing time where there is literally not a single film in theatres that I am passionate about seeing, there is little option aside from a decent popcorn flick like ICE AGE : THE MELTDOWN. It is not usually the kind of film that would draw me out to the theatres, however... considering my other options last night this was the best choice. As I expected, ICE AGE : THE MELTDOWN was a genuinely entertaining, though shallow, diversion with some great animation on display. I'm not an avid fan of the original ICE AGE... though I did find it entertaining and charming. THE MELTDOWN inspires the same response from me.What both this film and the original did so well was create a series of truly exciting action sequences that are framed by a lightweight comedic tone. Both films succeed at making the situations these animals find themselves in genuinely exciting. Whether it be a wild ride down melting ice, a perilous balancing act on a large stack of rocks, or on a breaking ice pond filled with giant vicious fish... all these sequences are truly exciting.In addition, the writers and directors of THE MELTDOWN really know how to utilize everything possible for comedy. The comedic style is very scattered... whether it be the dry wit of Manny the Mammoth (voiced by Ray Romano) or the ridiculous visual of Possum's acting like 'homeboys'. I certainly would never praise THE MELTDOWN's comedy for being one cohesive style, or for being particularly intelligent... but nonetheless it musters quite a few genuine laughs.My main complaint however, is that the film had two segments that were a complete waste of time. One sequence involved a musical number performed by the looming hawks, which offered no story development and was one of the least funny moments in the film... simply tacking 5 minutes onto the film's running time. The other sequence involved an overly familiar sacrifice scenario with Sid the Sloth. I can't help but imagine the writers were forced to cram this in so John Leguizamo (the voice of Sid) would feel like his character was given a story arc and some focus... b/c it served no purpose to the film. A film as lightweight and trivial as ICE AGE : THE MELTDOWN shouldn't have any useless sequences making it run longer then necessary, and that's exactly what these two scenes were.Overall, THE MELTDOWN makes for an entertaining night at the theater. (It's especially amazing how one dumb, ugly squirrel chasing an acorn never gets old). It's everything revolutionary film-making isn't... but it also has a lot of what popcorn blockbuster films for children should have, mixed in with enough jokes to keep the adults happy....

Brokeback Mountain," BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN : Beautifully Filmed & Emotionally Powerful...
","BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN The fact that the word love is rarely spoken (if ever) in BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN is a testament to the sheer brilliance with with Ang Lee has handled the tragic love story that is BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. While the tortured love affair between Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger, who's brilliant here) and Jack Twist (Jake Gylenhall) features a beautiful script, it is the unspoken emotion that creeps out of the screen with profound subtlety that truly tells this love story.The story opens one summer when Jack and Ennis are employed to watch over a herd of sheep on BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. It doesn't take long for the introverted Ennis to almost desperately open up to Jack, the only person who seems to have ever provided him every ounce of emotional support he's needed all his life. Their love continues even after both men become married... and they meet as often as possible in the only part of their world where they know how to be happy, on Brokeback.Although the story maintains a constant focus on both men's lives apart from one another, the focus is slightly skewed in Ennis' direction. This is probably because Jack's emotions are more consistent. While Jack is sure he could spend the rest of his life with Ennis, Ennis is too concealed to ever allow himself to come to the same realization on the surface.The irony is that Ennis has the more difficult time living the lie convincingly. His marriage to Alma dissolves slowly from the moment she witnesses a passionate kiss that her husband shares with Jack. The emotional divide between Alma (played beautifully by Michelle Williams, in a performance that will buck all preconceived notions of this former WB star) and Ennis is perfectly captured by Ang Lee's direction. We see the suffrage in Williams' eyes as she struggles to handle her conflicting compassion for Ennis with her anger for being betrayed.One of the most brilliantly played scenes in the film comes in the only moment that Ennis is confronted with the truth. After divorce, and emotional separation, Alma finally has the courage to let Ennis know about Jack... but her reasoning for never bringing it up before becomes clear as Ennis' depression boils over into fury at a moments notice, immediately threatening Alma with a blind rage.Ledger and Gylenhall bring a complete honesty to their roles and they are both phenomenal. The performances are of very different natures, but they have found differences that blend together perfectly in a believable love story. They are never in complete agreement on anything, yet their love for each other is never false. As said before, we never see the two characters say 'I love you'... and they are never overly affectionate with one another. But you can see behind their eyes that somewhere deep down inside the words are begging to come out. Jack longs to say these words to Ennis, but Gylenhall's performance shows that the only thing stopping him is knowing that Ennis could be scared off. Ennis fears saying the words b/c he's someone who has been so internal for so long... embracing his emotions and going against society scares him to death. While Ennis' is the 'tougher' of the two, he simply isn't strong enough to be what he wants to be... and we see this eating away at Ledger in every frame of the film.Anne Hathaway as Jack's wife Lureen is wonderful as well, and in her final phone conversation with Ennis she is riveting... but the role doesn't pack the emotional wallop that the other characters do.Ang Lee has crafted a masterpiece with BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN. It often feels as if you are not watching a movie, b/c it is so simple in it's beauty. He never cheats the jilted women, but he never makes the men have to apologize for anything. The pressure of society at that time is always clear, though never too in-your-face. Instead of focusing on outside influences, Lee looks into his two leading men to show what fear of society can do to a man. The imagery is beautiful, and even as I watched Ennis and Jack hold possibly the worst summer job ever, I completely realized and believed that for these characters, that awful job was a blessing.I only saw the film last night, and I possibly need to digest it more... and see it again to more so appreciate everything that Lee contributed to the film. On first viewing for me, it was all about the performances. So I can't put my finger on what it was exactly that Lee did so well... but I know he has constructed a classic. It's a film that can preaches without ever even coming close to being preachy... and a film that grabs it's audience at the gut without ever reaching out of the screen. BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN lets it's audience slowly come on their own, and through that connection with the characters, it becomes one of the most powerful love stories ever captured on film....

The Day After Tomorrow," DAY AFTER TOMORROW : Terribly Clichéd Story Picked Up A Bit By Top Notch Effects...
","THE DAY AFTER TOMORROWRoland Emmerich's roller-coaster ride of Global Warning terror is every bit as over-the-top as you could imagine. From the first previews of THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW it was clear the audience was in for a disaster film to end all disaster movies. The destruction of the world as we know it. The problem is, seeing the movie adds little to no emotional weight to the 'ooo's' and 'aaaah's' we experienced when we first got a glimpse of the trailer.THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW takes place on a day when Global Warming strikes the entire Northern Hemisphere. Only a handful of scientists are aware of the oncoming slaughter before hand and as a result half of America is trapped with no place to run from a deadly storm that includes tornadoes, blizzards, floods, hail, and sub-zero temperatures. Stuck in a public library with a few of his friends is Sam Hall (played by Jake Gyllenhaal), the son of leading American climatologist Jack Hall (played by Dennis Quaid). Here's the shocker though, they have an estranged father/son relationship and Jack must travel across the frozen wasteland that was once the northern USA to save his son.The main problem with this film is that the emotional center is painfully contrived. Why couldn't they have gone against the loop and had the father/son actually be very close? It would have given the film a fresh, less-familiar tone. Every time the film tries to delve into the drama of Jack and Sam's relationship I couldn't help but roll my eyes. One of my biggest pet peeves with movies is when I can tell the director is trying to make his audience cry, instead of just telling an honest story. Unfortunately, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is filled with scenes like that. To name a few:<ul><li>The scene with Jack in the tent talking about getting to his son. - The random cancer patient Sela Ward has to stay with through the storm (apparently there is only 1 patient who couldn't be moved and he just happens to be a 12 year old child?) - The death of Dennis Quaid's long-time friend</li></ul>All of these scenes dragged the film to a screeching halt for me as I had to excuse myself to laugh at the lame-ness.However, what THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW promised to deliver on (crazy action, fantastic effects, overwhelming danger) it succeeds at wildly. The sequences where the storm first approaches are nothing short of phenomenal. Especially the flooding of New York. All of these scenes don't even try to ground themselves in reality... they embrace the over-the-top edge to this story. It is these extensive action scenes that manage to keep the film alive despite the tiresome and clichéd story.As usual, Dennis Quaid manages to make more of the material then it deserves. However, Jake Gyllenhaal, though clearly a talented actor today, offers a completely confused performance. Perhaps if Sam were played better, the father/son story would have been more gripping... but as is, Gyllenhaal's performance does nothing to help the film. Ironically, I found this to be Emmy Rossum's best performance so far (not too challenging considering how unimpressed I was with her in both POSEIDON and PHANTOM OF THE OPERA).Overall, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW is more then entertaining enough to pass a few hours. However, it's not nearly strong enough a film to stick with it's audience more then a few minutes after the credits. It's too bad too, b/c a massive blockbuster about Global Warming could have probably been a little bit richer.... C ...",6,5,7,15 June 2006
X-Men," X-MEN : Not Too Exciting, But A Great Set-Up For Future Sequels...
","X-MEN After seeing X-MEN:THE LAST STAND in the theaters I was anxious to revisit the film that started the franchise. Lately, X2 has been on television all the time, and considering it's the better film then X-MEN I've seen it more often. When I first saw X-MEN in the theaters, I was left with mixed feelings for the film. I couldn't help but admire it for bringing to the screen my favorite childhood characters... however, I couldn't help but be underwhelmed compared to the pictures I'd had in my imagination all those years.X-MEN, the first film in the franchise, had an almost impossible task in front of it when it was made. The scope and sheer size of the comic book stories is so huge it's impossible to please all the fans of the series. If the first film had started with the origin of the X-MEN... we would have had to wait through numerous films to see many of our favorite X-MEN. However, to dive into the middle of a story that took place over centuries of time in the comic books risks alienating fans of the original story lines. Bryan Singer had to make a choice... remain 100% faithful to the comics or remain loyal to the central theme while manipulating some characters and stories to work in a film franchise. Either way, not everyone could be 100% please.In the end, Singer opted to re-formulate some stories and characters. I assume he did so in order to make it feel more current, and to ensure that bringing some other mutants in for further installments in the series was easier to accomplish. It is in this choice that my reservations for this first film were born. When I first left the theater, my mind was filled with thoughts like 'Why does Rogue not do anything she's supposed to' and 'Why did they not use certain mutants enough' and 'Couldn't this have been bigger?'.Now, having seen where the franchise continued to move, I can appreciate these changes a little more. Things in the first film felt surprisingly hollow to me when I first saw it in the theaters. I saw that there were subtle allusions to the Dark Pheonix Saga as well as a strong establishment of the 'mutant war'... however the sequels to the film have made me appreciate the subtlety of this first installment more.X-MEN begins the story of the X-Men in a time when mutant privacy is being threatened. Senator Kelly (played by Bruce Davison) is leading the campaign that all mutants should be forced to register as such. However, two allegiances of mutants, led by Profesor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) have very strong feelings against this campaign. Profesor X leads the X-Men in the fight to co-exist with humans peacefully, while Magneto leads the fight to eliminate human supremacy.Meanwhile, a young girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin, who unfortunately is mis-cast in this role) is discovering she has powers she can't control, nor does she want. After being taken under the wing of Wolverine (played to perfection by Hugh Jackman), they find themselves under Profesor X's protection. But exactly who needs to be protected and from what? The problem with this film as a stand alone piece is that there simply is not enough action. I assume budget constraints kept the film from being able to unleash all the action we see in X-MEN:THE LAST STAND... however, the lack of any real fight scene pitting a team of X-Men against an opponent is the major disappointment here. Action scenes clearly had to be created on a small budget, and while some more intimate fights remain exciting (Wolverine vs. Mystique in particular)... the finale leaves the audience slightly underwhelmed.However, as an introduction to the series this film functions rather well. Those subtle allusions to Dark Pheonix and the 'mutant war' I mentioned before don't seem as hollow now that I see they were actual seeds to future plots. Also, the fact that this film a character study of Rogue and Wolverine more then anything gives additional weight to the future films.All in all, although the film seems boring as a stand-alone 'blockbuster action film'... it adds weight to what has turned out to be a compelling franchise. It is a more personal film then X-MEN:THE LAST STAND and it is a more information film then X2:X-MEN UNITED. Although at first I couldn't fully appreciate it as an avid fan, I have come to enjoy the original X-MEN film for what it is. A good, if not great film, that is a strong establishment of better things to come.... B ...",8,0,0,14 June 2006
Match Point," MATCH POINT : An Awful Performance From Rhys-Meyers Damages The Entire Film...
","MATCH POINT As such an avid film fanatic, it's amazing that it's taken me this long to ever see a Woody Allen film in it's entirety (sp?). Aside from bits and pieces of ALICE, ANNIE HALL, and DECONSTRUCTING HARRY I have never seen Allen's work. Odd that the first film of his I see, MATCH POINT, is deemed as a big change of pace for him.The film is a very elegantly crafted romantic sex-thriller. It is rich with analogies and symbolism that are obvious enough for the audience to pick up on, but not overtly blatant. The symbolism/message of that first tennis match is well maintained throughout the film with a subtle, gleaning style well managed by Allen.I enjoyed the concept in the script, and thought that London was filmed beautifully. Allen made brilliant use of the scenery, with London coming across as a sophisticated New York.However, a main weakness in this film is the disappointing performance of it's leading actor, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers. A charismatic and talented star who has exhibited potential in his previous films... Rhys-Meyers comes up noticeably short here. His performance is monotone, and all surface. He plays Chris, an ex pro-tennis player who is now entering high society through his relationship with Chloe (Emily Mortimer). However, as he becomes more and more comfortable living the comfortable life, he becomes less and less fulfilled by marriage. He seeks out a passionate affair with Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansen) and struggles to continue getting everything he wants.Though we see that he is torn between a comfortable/luxurious life and the passionate one he has on the side, Rhys-Meyers does little to emphasize this. He seduces when he needs to seduce, he cries when he needs to cry, and he yells when he needs to yell. But I never noticed a constant tone of a man torn and tormented by his own greed. It just seemed Meyers didn't bring enough to the table here. The performance is especially terrible in the opening scenes. This is where Rhys-Meyers has the chance to establish the man Chris is aside from all the situations he is in later in the film... but Meyers delivers nothing but monotone and empty lines.Thankfully the film has some life pumped into it every time it's leading females are on-screen. MATCH POINT features strong performances from Emily Mortimer and Scarlett Johansenn as the two sides of womanhood that men truly desire... comfort and mystery. Mortimer's Chloe is a less explosive role, b/c she's never given much to react to. However, Mortimer fills her with an ignorant optimism and love that remains endearing. She is subtly suspicious when the affair is obvious, but realistically lied to by a conniving husband.Johannsen has received most of the acclaim and buzz surrounding MATCH POINT... and it is not entirely unwarranted. She energizes the screen every time she appears (thankfully keeping the audience interested while Meyer's stands there)... and her sexual allure has never been more compelling. She also manages to keep Nola entirely sympathetic. Johannsen's first few scenes had me wary, and I found her initial deliveries to be as monotone as Meyers... however, from the moment Nola has a few drinks with Chris after a failed audition, Johannsen is spot on.Overall, it's an intriguing film... and it kept me interested for it's 2 hour running time. However, it suffers from an awful leading performance, some plot holes in it's conclusion, and a truly unlikeable and despicable male lead. Perhaps Chris could have been a more sympathetic and tolerable character had he been played by an actor with more talent... but as is, I never once liked the character of Chris. As a matter of fact, I loathed him. My word of choice upon leaving the theatre was 'douchebag'... and neither Allen's writing or Rhys-Meyer's performance was able to elevate the character.For me, MATCH POINT is an interesting film with a terribly handled leading male... and in the end, though the film is interesting, it is far from perfect. I left in a bad mood, and I don't think that was completely necessary. Some additional balancing of Chris' motivations from a directorial viewpoint (Woody Allen) and recasting Chris (kick Rhys-Meyers to the curb on this one)... and MATCH POINT could have been great. As is...... C- ...",6,0,9,11 January 2006
Silent Hill," SILENT HILL : One Big Jumbled Mess...
","SILENT HILL It's one thing for a movie not to make sense... it make the audience think. It's an entirely different thing when the movie doesn't make an ounce of sense in addition to being too long, boring, idiotic, and not frightening. Unfortunately, SILENT HILL is all those things.What looked like it could potentially be 2006's scariest movie based on previews becomes a muddled piece of garbage on the big screen. Essentially the movie is one long preview to a movie that looks intriguing, but leaves too many questions unanswered. A preview is a brief jumbling of different images without answering the audience's every question in order to bring them into the seats (keyword: brief). SILENT HILL is basically a preview, leaving questions unanswered and jumbling together random images that mixed together are simply confusing... only this preview drags on and on and on past 2 hours.Based on a popular video game, SILENT HILL features some of the most stylized direction I've seen in a long time. Sadly, this stylization is not held together by a director with not a single ounce of apparent talent for coherent storytelling. Somewhere in all this footage there might have been a good performance from Radha Mitchell... but not as they're packaged here.The most frustrating part of all this, is that there is the potential for an interesting movie here. But it seems that a directed with limited scope and vision thought he was making some horror masterpiece here. Instead, it's really nothing more than a big tangled up mess, and a huge disappointment.... F ...",1,10,21,11 May 2006
Crash," CRASH : This Movie Sucks & Needs To Get Over Itself...
","CRASH Okay, I'm not trying to sound controversial and annoying... but this movie is b.a.d. I certainly won't call it the worst movie of the year, because a truly terrible film does not have redeeming qualities. CRASH has a few moments and aspects that manage to shine despite the overall terribleness of the package.The Good News...The Thandie Newton/Matt Dillon car crash scene (the 2nd) was very powerfully constructed and beautifully played by the two actors. This five minute period was the only moment of the film that I felt came together and worked.Matt Dillon, Terrence Howard, Ryan Phillipe & Thandie Newton offer good performances (I personally wouldn't nominate them for any awards, but it doesn't irk me to see that some of them are getting recognition).The Bad News...Everything else is wrong. I went into this film knowing the debate between people on these boards... some people don't find it preachy... others do. So I though I'd go into it with an open mind.2 minutes in, from the second they showed Jennifer Esposito (a f*****n' detective) making fun of the way the other woman pronounces brakes 'blakes' I knew this film was preachy. And then it just got worse and worse and worse. Sandra Bullock yelling and insisting on changing the clocks. Ludicrous' endless rants, shut up. For the entire first half of this movie, every single person is angry and screaming at each other.Now I know racism exists, and I don't think that not liking CRASH means I don't understand that. I've heard arguments from some critics literally casting off negative reviews of this film saying 'you have no idea what racism is'... well you might be right, but that doesn't make this a good movie.A movie is far more interesting if it takes a stereotype, and then examines it to make it something very independent... goes beyond the stereotype. This movie never bothers to do that... it tries to convey it's message by slamming stereotype after stereotype in your face. It doesn't take more than 10 minutes for it all to seem relentless.If this movie were divided up into 8 different movies... and told each story with personal details and development... then I think you would have 8 films telling very unique, and honest stories about racism today. But they are all crammed in to the point where we never see the after-effects these terrible situations have on the victims. Instead, we merely see the incidents happening one after the other... Oh, but I'm sorry... they make it personal through that generic (just like on every F/X drama on the air today) slow-mo montage of the entire cast finding a happier place to some cool acoustic guitar music.I can't believe this is has been so highly regarded in the Screenplay department. I think if you took that same screenplay, word for word, and didn't frame it with all the 'important movie' clichés (i.e. slow mos, lots of swearing, money scenes, spiritual music... blah blah blah) this screenplay would obviously be seen as the melodramatic hack that it is.Bullock, Cheadle, Fraser, Esposito, Ludicrous, Larenz Tate, and every other actor in this movie couldn't manage to muster good performances from such dreg. It must have been hard being expected to deliver such campy lines w/o campy portrayals.Everything is balanced terribly in this movie. My feelings towards this film are hard to capture adequately in a review... so after some reflection I might reword this. But in the end, CRASH deserves no awards this season... at least not in my book.... F ...",1,10,19,3 January 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," PANS LABRYINTH : This Adult Fairy Tale Is 2006's Most Visually Stunning & Absorbing Film...
","PANS LABRYINTH With PANS LABYRINTH, Guillermo Del Toro has managed to create an adult fairy tale that pays homage to classically dark children's stories like ALICE IN WONDERLAND without ever abandoning a purely adult tone. The film is a masterpiece on many levels, but perhaps what is most impressive about PANS LABYRINTH is the fact that it can seamlessly blend such dangerously varied genres (fairy tales, war films, coming-of-age drama, horror film, etc) into a piece that is capable of reaching fans of each genre without alienating the other. PANS LABYRINTH is a film that truly could, and should, be enjoyed by everyone over the age of 15.The movie tells the story of Ofelia (played with stunning maturity by Ivana Baquero) as she moves in with her new step-father, Captain Vidal (Sergi Lopez, in an intimidating performance). Ofelia's mother is pregnant, and Captain Vidal's only reason for taking on this new family is to ensure that he has a son to carry on his legacy. Captain Vidal is a brutal man, willing to kill anyone who presents opposition to him, and young Ofelia, with a wandering imagination, wants out.One of the most delightful elements of PANS LABYRINTH is the way Del Torro never seems to make a concrete decision as to whether the fantasy elements are reality or not. It's the same approach used in THE WIZARD OF OZ and ALICE IN WONDERLAND, in which the viewer is left wondering if Dorothy ever really left Kansas, or if Alice ever really went down a rabbit hole. Once Ofelia arrives at her new home, fantastic things start to happen to her. First, a fairy visits her at night and leads her to the bottom of Capt. Vidal's backyard Labyrinth. It is here that Ofelia meets Pan, the faun. Ofelia learns that she may in fact be a long lost princess of the underworld, and only by completing three very specific tasks can she ever escape the nightmare that is Post-War Spain.PANS LABYRINTH can be appreciated on many levels. From some angles, it seems like an interpretation of what heaven may be to the young girl. In another way, it acts as a propaganda film for keeping our earth healthy and alive. Perhaps some might see the movie as an exploration of how one's sanity is destroyed in war. And from yet another viewpoint, PANS LABRYINTH is simply an engrossing fairy tale with high stakes and incredible tension. Masterfully wrapped together by the hands of Guillermo Del Toro, the film works on all these levels.Alongside the LOTR trilogy, PANS LABYRINTH is one of the greatest examples of how incredible a fantasy film can be if it isn't given the care and attention it deserves. The creativity is literally pouring from the screen, and believe me, PANS LABYRINTH is without a doubt the most stunningly visual film of the year (though THE FOUNTAIN is a strong second). The creatures that inhabit this fantasy world are simply incredible to look at, whether they are lovable (the image of a praying mantis-like creature trying to take on the appearance of a fairy) or downright terrifying (the image of an eyeless creature who rests in slumber till a child comes for dinner), PANS LABRYINTH's creatures are never second rate.Absolutely everybody should see PANS LABYRINTH. It will mean different things to different audiences, depending on the viewers skepticism and age. However, one thing is for sure... no matter what feelings PANS LABYRINTH stirs for it's viewer, it is the most absorbing 2 hours of cinema released in 2006. Del Torro has relished in the fact that his film never has a set structure or audience, and in doing so he has blessed us with one of the most creatively exuberant fantasies ever....

Capote," CAPOTE : An Acting Showcase & Much More...
","CAPOTE For the past few months, when CAPOTE was easily available for me to see at local theaters, I refused to go b/c something about Phillip Seymour Hoffman always irritates me. I had no desire to see the film. My mother however has wanted to see it for months, and was determined to see it before it left the one theater it was still showing in Connecticut, 45 minutes away. So I figured what the hell, I'd see it so I could have a more developed opinion on the Best Actor race.Well, I'm glad I did.CAPOTE was much better than I thought it would be. First off, the story of how Truman Capote became involved and obsessed with the writing of his novel IN COLD BLOOD is a fascinating one. And, despite my personal distaste, Phillip Seymour Hoffman brought this character to the screen like no one else would have been able to.In previews, I heard his voice and it was like nails on a chalkboard... however, in the movie, that voice simply amplified Capote's razor wit. Hoffman performance never felt like an imitation to me... granted the voice had to be imitated... but beneath the voice, Hoffman was living the role through all the emotional highs and lows. The voice and mannerisms were merely the surface of this performance. You can imitate a man's voice and physicality... but you can not IMITATE the descent of a man into depression and obsession. That has to be felt organically by the actor, and it's exactly what Hoffman does here.The film itself is also a taught, emotional experience. The scoring was perfectly eerie without ever trying to cross over into a thriller.One clear divide I was thinking while watching this movie is the difference between a Hollywood biopic... and a true biopic film. CAPOTE conveyed who the man was and told his story in an unconventional way. They told the story of this man's entire life, by focusing on his most important years. We find out what his past was by watching the man he had become. This is completely different film from the more mainstream WALK THE LINE... and I appreciate this kind of biopic a little more.The supporting performances were all great in terms of supporting the biggest aspect of the film, Hoffman's performance. I actually most preferred Chris Cooper's work in his small role. Awards-buzz for Keener seems odd just considering there wasn't really anything for her to do. Some people call the performance not showy enough for Oscar's tastes... well I think the role simply wasn't good. None of Harper Lee's pivotal moments of influence were captured on film b/c the director chose to follow Truman Capote the entire team... in the end leaving Harper Lee as a side-note. There is nothing wrong with this and it ultimately works for the film... and Keener delivers everything required of her... but I don't see this as an Oscar-Worthy performance. If nominated I'd prefer recognition for her performance in THE 40-YEAR OLD VIRGIN.Overall, CAPOTE snuck up on me from behind to become one of my favorite movies of the year. From that first moment when the murdered bodies were discovered, I knew this was going to be a good film.The only thing that kept the film from getting an A were a couple of moments that left me confused. Was Perry the only one to actually carry out the killings? That's how it was shown, but not how the men were tried? Also, what was it that Harper Lee NEEDED to tell Truman over the phone that got him out of his bed? This seemed to be a big moment that was slightly unclear to me.Aside from these small details, everything worked, and it taught me about a little chunk of history I never knew was so fascinating. CAPOTE is Phillip Seymour Hoffman's best performance and an amazing film wrapped into one package. And if anyone else had reservations about seeing it... I recommend a change of heart....

The Devil Wears Prada," THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA : Cinematic Equivalent To Wal-Mart Clothing, Enriched By A Killer Performance
","THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA In one of THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA's most interesting moments, Lucifer herself Miranda Priestley (played like dry ice by Meryl Streep) discloses to her unknowing assistant Andy just how deeply layered fashion's influence on the world is. Whether others see it or not, Miranda knows that fashion determines everything. Even an article of clothing as hideous and offensive as Andy's Wal-Mart sweater was born from Miranda Priestley's knowledge of fashion. Everything from the most expensive Prada handbag to the cheapest department store purchase was born from Miranda Priestley's influence. In other words, fashion is more then just pretty clothes... it's art. Or at least that's how the boss from hell sees it in this high-style comedy directed by David Frankel.THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA tells the story of Andy Sachs (played by Anne Hathaway), a recent graduate with dreams of a being a real journalist in the big city. One morning, she finds herself interviewing for one of the most coveted positions in the fashion industry, an industry she knows nothing about. Andy interviews to be the second assistant for Miranda Priestley, Editor-In-Chief of 'Runway' Magazine... and by some twist of fate she lands the job. Despite a lack of passion for fashion, Andy takes the job because after one year she'll have the only thing she currently lacks... power in her industry. However, life in this industry proves more jarring then Andy could have ever imagined.It's ironic that, despite Miranda Priestley's eloquently stated belief in the importance of fashion, the film that depicts that industry is nothing but a fun and expensive display of pretty clothes. Granted, the clothes and styles on screen in THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA are incredibly beautiful, and this is sure to please the fashion conscious world that will make up most of the films audience. However, for someone like me, it would have been nice to have a director take the reigns in a Miranda Priestly style. By refusing to accept anything that is mere fluff, and demanding depth and precision at every turn, this film could have really soared. Sadly, the aforementioned scene in which Miranda lectures Andy on fashion was the only moment in this film where I felt the movie had a distinct voice.Aside from that moment, I left THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA thinking 'Yes, it was fun... but what was the point?' The film has been heavily promoted as a comedy, yet I didn't find myself laughing. On top of that, I never cared about a single character more then I would in a run-of-the-mill romantic comedy. So why did I still find THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA to be a decent film? I think the appeal lies in that carnal curiosity everyone has since grade school. The desire to see what it's like to be the most popular kid in the room... even though every ounce of common sense tells you the popular kids are not worth your time. Miranda Priestley represents the cruelest of the cool kids, as she flaunts her power and money in the cruelest way. Her life is one people yearn for even while she cuts them down with an evil glare for simply breathing in her air. This living devil of a woman is captured brilliantly in a magnetic performance from Meryl Streep. Much fuss has been made over this being Meryl's best 'comedic' performance ever... I disagree. As a matter of fact, I didn't find anything funny in the entire movie. Nonetheless, the performance is fascinating to watch. What a pleasure to watch a performance so lived in given by such a great actress. Every fiber of her being wreaks of evil.Aside from Meryl Streep, THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA does feature an enjoyable performance from Anne Hathaway and some killer clothes... but not much more. The story is formulaic, and every twist and turn is cliché. It's just decorated a little more expensively then your average romantic comedy. As I think back on how well Streep was able to convey the importance of fashion in one scene, it becomes clearer why this movie disappointments. If you take away the fancy clothes and Streep's performance, this movie feels as familiar and ordinary as the Wal-Mart sweaters that 'Runway' magazine looks upon with unabashed disgust....

Corpse Bride," CORPSE BRIDE : Visually Stunning, Outlandishly Funny, & Emotionally Honest...
","CORPSE BRIDE Though I was very excited to see it, I was unsure of what to expect when I watched CORPSE BRIDE because I've been somewhat underwhelmed by most of Tim Burton's current films. BIG FISH was merely okay for me, and CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY was visually stunning and had some great elements, but was marred by some terrible creative decisions.However, CORPSE BRIDE proves to be Tim Burton's best film in years as it combines an outlandish visual style, a crazed storyline, blatant caricatures, and a very genuine emotional storyline to make a highly entertaining film. In my honest opinion, CORPSE BRIDE would be the most worthy winner of the Best Animated Feature Oscar this year.CORPSE BRIDE has a lot in common with it's biggest rival, WALLACE & GROMIT. Both films embrace outlandish stylizations and wring every last bit of humor out of the possible visual imagery. However, where W&G had a lackadaisical wit about it that pretty much left an emotional story on the sidelines in exchange for endlessly entertaining stupid humor... CORPSE BRIDE manages to also involve an emotionally involving story and characters with a good deal of depth.In CORPSE BRIDE, the physical characteristics embody the voice over work beautifully and the film is always incredible to behold visually. But the best quality of the film is that it does not simply rely on the visuals and humor. The film takes time to explore the longings and desires of these unrealistic characters in a very realistic way... and as a result of Burton's direction, we are able to both care very much for the characters, but also laugh at how ridiculous they are.The voice-work in this film is spot on all around. Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham Carter, and Emily Watson all add fully realized portrayals to the 3 leading characters... while Tracy Ullman, Albert Finney, and Johanna Lumley provide brilliantly overcharacterized comedic voice work for their supporting characters. In my opinion, CORPSE BRIDE has taken the energetic visual spunk of the common recent animated films... but it has also added a more creatively and fully developed screenplay than most others. And the adding together of so many wonderful parts leaves the audience with an overall delight of a film.... A- ...",9,0,0,3 March 2006
Gone Baby Gone," GONE BABY GONE : Evidence That Affleck Has Potential As A Director, But Not A Perfect Piece...
","GONE BABY GONE As an avid non-fan of Ben Affleck, I disregarded GONE BABY GONE when it first hit theatres because of my skepticism. When the reviews hit, it started to seem like I wasn't giving Affleck a fair chance b/c critics were favorable. But I allowed myself to believe the positive reviews Affleck received for HOLLYWOODLAND and go see the movie with an open mind... let's just say HOLLYWOODLAND was not a good experience for me and I fervently disagree with the critics on that one! So I was wary of GONE BABY GONE from the start. However, as the film managed to keep some presence through awards-season (for both Amy Ryan and Ben Affleck as a debut filmmaker) my curiosity got the better of me. I'm glad it did.Not to say that GONE BABY GONE is a perfect film, it does feel a little like a first-time directorial effort. However, it's a film that shows Affleck might have promise as a director that he does not hold as an actor. GONE BABY GONE is a solid crime drama that tells the story of an abducted young girl through the eyes of a private investigator with no experience on this kind of case.Casey Affleck, in a solid performance, plays Patrick Kenzie, a young man who's lived in Boston his whole life and now works as an independent investigator alongside his girlfriend Angie Gennaro (Michelle Monaghan). Angie and Patrick are roped in to 'enhance' the ongoing investigation that is taking place to locate a young girl named Amanda McReady. She is the daughter of a drug-runner (Amy Ryan), and she has disappeared under mysterious circumstances from an unhappy home. With the help of Detective Remy Bressant (Ed Harris), Patrick tries to find a way to balance his ethical beliefs with the necessary decisions his line of work present him with. But as Patrick and Angie uncover more of the truth, it becomes apparent this is nothing close to a typical abduction.The film spends the first half of it's running time exploring the story as if it is your standard kidnapping investigation, but in the second half there is a major shift that brings the film into a totally different direction. The film has received comparisons to both MYSTIC RIVER and THE DEPARTED for basic reasons... using the Boston landscape most obviously. But the film does feel like a blend of the two films, that doesn't quite find the perfect balance to make it all work. Half of the film focuses on the human drama of an abduction like this (like MYSTIC RIVER), while the other half explores corruption vs. honor (like THE DEPARTED). These two parts never come together perfectly for GONE BABY GONE, but it still never goes completely off the rails.Casey Affleck carries the film well and offers the movie's most nuanced and fully felt performance for my tastes. He proves that he is able to take his conversational and laid back approach to dialogue and lace it with gravitas just as well as he is able to lace it with humor (as exemplified in the OCEAN'S films). Amy Ryan has received a great deal of critical acclaim and awards attention for her performance as the burnt-out mother of the abducted child, and she does a phenomenal job of fully embodying Helene McReady. However, her screen time is limited and the character doesn't really have a change of heart. She is a one-note mess of a woman, and a frustrating one at that. Ed Harris and Morgan Freeman offer typically solid performances, but it's nothing new to see from them. Meanwhile, Monaghan escapes unscathed, but her character has virtually no definition. Though she is always present, she feels remarkably unnecessary and her relationship with Frankie does little to strengthen the films primary themes.Overall, GONE BABY GONE is a solid, though unremarkable film. It vastly exceeded any expectations I would have placed on a Ben Affleck film however, and I won't avoid his film in theatres next time.... B- ...",6,1,2,19 February 2008
Over the Hedge," OVER THE HEDGE : Formulaic, But The Comedy Is Still Worth It...
","OVER THE HEDGE Dreamworks' latest computer-animated release OVER THE HEDGE is a truly polished film told in the typical formula. That formula - taking cute(or really ugly) characters, placing them in outlandish situations, have the villain be some stupid human, and sprinkle lots of adult humor and pop-culture references to make it's comedy more edgy. The thing with OVER THE HEDGE is, it manages to take that formula and keep it lively... unfortunately it still can't avoid the label of being a 'formulaic' movie.OVER THE HEDGE tells the story of RJ (Bruce Willis), a scavenger raccoon who lives on his own off of other people's food. However, he makes the mistake of trying to rob Vincent the bear (voiced by an enjoyably evil Nick Nolte) of all his food during hibernation. When Vincent catches RJ in the act, RJ is forced to regather that much food in one weeks time or else he will be 'offed' (sound like A BUG'S much?). To save his life, RJ sets out to con a loving family of forest animals led by Verne the Turtle (Garry Shandling) into robbing the local humans of all their food.OVER THE HEDGE excels at infusing it's story with laugh-out-loud comedy. Even though the storyline is familiar and the characters seem like characteristics, the jokes are fresh and elicits genuine laughter. Also, despite the familiarity of the 'cute characters', some of them have such inspired voice work that they manage to stand out. Steve Carrel proves that he is the master of evoking comedy out of any and all situations... his character of Hammy the Squirell is a riot.The storyline, though familiar & lacking in substance is handled with a brisk and lighthearted pace that makes the film fly by. It even manages to get in some environmental commentary on America in without being too heavy-handed (though at times the whole 'people are lazy' bit goes a little too far... don't insult your audience Dreamworks!).However, the film has some distinct flaws too. Aside from the inspired voice work of Mr. Carrell and serviceable performances from the rest of the cast... this film also features some of the worst voice-over work I've ever heard. Whichever casting agent thought that by casting Avril Lavinge was a good idea should be fired... asap. Sorry Avril, stick to the songwriting cuz this performance was awful. What might have been a better idea was simply hiring her to write the music... b/c whoever they did hire to write the songs was terrible as well. For some reason OVER THE HEDGE felt the need to include 3 musical montages all set to some of the corniest music I've ever heard. All of these montages proved pointless and they brought what is essentially a funny, fast-paced comedy to a screeching halt.Overall, the good-intentions and genuine laughs won me over. Despite the two major flaws in Lavigne's voice-work and the craptastic music... OVER THE HEDGE remains one of the funniest comedies I've seen in theaters for a while. At this point it's still okay for a Dreamworks' animated movie to fly-by on sheer comedy and joy alone. However, as a warning to Dreamworks, the formula will get old soon and it's time the powers that be over there start to improve and differentiate their animated films... b/c soon enough, genuine laughs won't be enough anymore....

Dreamgirls," DREAMGIRLS : A Movie Musical To Re-Ignite The Genre With It's Soaring Energy...
","DREAMGIRLS Firstly, it would be unfair to review a film like DREAMGIRLS without acknowledging some of it's many flaws. After a year of hype, DREAMGIRLS proves a slight disappointment in terms of emotional gravitas & depth. When a film is hyped for an entire year as the front-runner for the Academy Award, film-goers have every right to go into the film expecting fully-developed characters, rich emotion, & detailed storytelling. However, film-goers be warned... you aren't bound to get what you expect. DREAMGIRLS is rather shallow in terms of character development & genuine plot. However, if you go in expecting the film to be a stunning spectacle of entertainment & fun, you will not be disappointed.Whatever DREAMGIRLS may lack in terms of complexity, it makes up for with sheer energy & relentless commitment to entertain its audience. The admittedly thin story revolves around the discovery & rising stardom of a trio of young women from Detroit; Deena Jones (Beyonce Knowles), Lorrell Robinson (Anika Noni Rose) & Effie White (Jennifer Hudson). After meeting manager Curtis Taylor (Jamie Foxx) at an amateur night, the girls find themselves on tour with one of the country's leading African-American entertainers named Jimmy Early (Eddie Murphy). As they tour the country, Curtis romances the girl's lead singer Effie White & slowly develops the girls as a solo act named the Dreams.However, once the Dreams are ready to cross-over on their own, the dynamic changes completely & the happy rise to stardom becomes troublesome. In order to market the group to white audiences, Curtis replaces Effie with Deena as lead singer, causing a rift in the group dynamic which leads to Effie's retaliation & inevitable dismissal from the group. While the first half of the film focuses on the rise to stardom, the second half focuses on the continued stardom of Deena, who is now married to Curtis, & the struggle of Effie to make it on her own. As is clear from the plot description, the actual twists & turns of the plot are rather complex... but the depth with which they are examined is very lacking.Nonetheless, what makes DREAMGIRLS one of the most thrilling cinematic experiences of the year is the sheer energy & talent of it's inarguably incredible cast. From the very first notes, it is clear that DREAMGIRLS is a return to the grandest of musical formats. Bill Condon has decided not to hold back in any way. The costumes, the lighting, the music, & the choreography are so 'in your face' incredible that once this movie gets going the audience can't slow down. Bill Condon does a decent job of incorporating some racial tones into the film with the Detroit Riots and 'I Have A Dream'.. but these racial elements can't eclipse the glitz & glamor that makes DREAMGIRLS what it is.No review of DREAMGIRLS would be complete without acknowledging the contributions of it's incredibly talented cast. Jamie Foxx in the role of conniving businessman Curtis Taylor Jr. brings a subtlety to the screen that is almost off-putting at first when you consider how flashy his performances usually are. However, Foxx's subtle sliminess makes the slow revelation that Curtis is a man virtually devoid of emotion all the more unsettling. Meanwhile, Beyonce Knowles as front-woman Deena Jones is certainly the most beautiful screen presence to reach the silver screen in years. But it would be an understatement to simply acknowledge Beyonce's beauty, as she manages to travel leaps & bounds above her previous screen efforts. On the page, Deena is an incredibly underdeveloped character, but in the few moments of depth we see in Deena, it is clear that the script short-changed Beyonce's potential here. Eddie Murphy is a sheer joy in one of his best roles, & he exhibits a singing voice that sounds like it was plucked straight out of Motown's heyday. Again, like Deena Jones, Jimmy Early is rather underdeveloped on paper with a drug addiction that seems more like a plot contrivance than a genuine character flaw... but Eddie Murphy gives the sub-plot more resonance than one would expect from the script. His relationship with Lorrell (played by a delightful Anika Noni Rose) is surprisingly the most well developed romantic pairing in the film.Finally, one can't possibly review DREAMGIRLS without acknowledging the fact that this will go down in history as the moment the world was truly introduced to the talents of Jennifer Hudson. As the most crucial role of the film, Effie White is the most emotionally rich character in the entire piece, while also being a scene stealer both vocally & attitude-wise. Hudson delivers on all levels, especially in the vocal department. If she does not go on to be a significant force in the music industry, it only goes to show that the industry sometimes has no clue what to do with genuine talent. In the acting department, Hudson doesn't shine quite as strongly as she does vocally... but for a reality star's film debut this is a transcendent performance richly deserving of the awards attention she has received.Overall, one might ask why a film like DREAMGIRLS, with it's numerous flaws and shortcomings is still ranked with a 10 by myself. Personally, I think sometimes a film does not have to be graded simply on it's depth & complexity. There's a place in this world for movies that soar as sheer entertainment just as much as there is a place for heavy, dramatic pieces. DREAMGIRLS isn't the type of film that will change your life or reach it's audience on a deep level. However, it is the type of film I could watch over & over on DVD & still not absorb every detail. DREAMGIRLS might not be the 'Best' motion picture of the year, but it certainly is the most entertaining motion picture I've seen in years.... A ...",10,32,67,9 January 2007
Spider-Man," SPIDERMAN : Great Comic-Book Adaptation...
","SPIDERMAN I've been meaning to see SPIDERMAN 2 b/c I know it had a very passionate following so when I came across the original on television I figured I'd remind myself of everything that happened in the first film. I saw the first SPIDERMAN in theaters when it first came out and I remember just being surprised by how entertaining the whole thing was... and though knowing what comes next does ruin some of the fun, SPIDERMAN is still a really great comic book adaptation.Sam Raimi's SPIDERMAN tells the story of Peter Parker (played by a perfectly cast Toby Maguire) and his origins as Spiderman. As Parker gets used to his new role as a superhero, he also struggles with his feelings towards his life-time crush Mary-Jane (played by Kirsten Dunst). To complicate matters, New York suddenly finds itself in danger of the Green Goblin (played by a perfectly cast Willem Dafoe) who only Spiderman can fight back.SPIDERMAN isn't like a typical action/superhero movie. The film certainly takes it's time between action sequences and thrills... and upon reflection the film is rather tame in comparison to other blockbusters when it comes to action. This isn't to say SPIDERMAN lacks excitement however. Actually, it's a good film because it excels so much in it's story driven scenes.The story they are telling in this movie isn't the most complicated or realistic ever captured on film... but it is filmed with an exuberance and energy unlike many films. It is like a young boy's vision of what a comic-book should be, told with the master-craftsmanship of a skilled director. Instead of choosing to show blood and violence all the time, Raimi creates extended sequences of Peter Parker's sheer joy and excitement discovering he can jump over building and swing throughout New York. Raimi perfectly balances both the dark side and the lighthearted side of this story.Sometimes a film doesn't have to have an important message or a revelatory story to make it good... it just needs to be told well. SPIDERMAN succeeds at taking it's material and making everything out of it it possibly could. Peter Parker is both an incredibly endearing hero, while the audience also sympathizes with his demons... and I can't wait to watch the follow-up next time I go to the video store....

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," PRISONER OF AZKABAN : Stylistically Superior, Though The Storyline Underwhelms
","HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN The third installment of the Harry Potter franchise represented a re-birth of sorts for the series b/c new creative blood was brought in. Alfonso Cuaron took over the director's chair from Christopher Columbus... resulting in the first Harry Potter 'film', as opposed to the Harry Potter 'movies' we'd seen already.With the new vision of Cuaron, the movie feels more magical and real. Columbus' films seemed to always pull back and capture Hogwarts on a grand, blockbuster scale. Any moment that called for special effects or some sort of magic, Christopher Columbus seems to fall to the predictable conclusion of tacking on special effects. In this film however, Cuaron finds a way to capture some of Hogwart's magic on a very personal, simplistic scale... and as a result it resonates in a much stronger way. For example, when a character turns into a werewolf at the very end (a scene that Colubmus would have filmed from a distance capturing the special effects) chooses to zoom in on the eye and have the transformation start there. It's a simple choice... however it is that kind of bold decision making that Columbus lacked in the first 2 films.PRISONER OF AZKABAN tells the story of Harry's 3rd year at Hogwarts. When he arrives he discovers that Sirius Black, the man who killed his parents, is the first person to ever escape from Azkaban prison... and he is now out to kill Harry Potter. Do to the danger, Hogwarts is protected by Azkaban's guards... the Dementors... and the staff is on high alert. However, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermoine can not help but investigate the story behind Sirius Black and what they find isn't what the expected.As I've said already, the main strengths of this film lie in the direction of Alfonso Cuaron. Also enjoyable is the addition of David Thewlis and Gary Oldman as Prof. Lupin and Sirius Black. Their camaraderie especially in the final moments of the film is very compelling.Despite the film's superior direction, it still lags at points in the middle. This section spends a lot of time giving the younger actors and their characters more depth... exploring the tension Harry feels towards his parents' murdered, exploring Hermoine's situation as a Muggle. What hurts this section so much is that the young actors just don't deliver. While the performances were merely aspects of the spectacle in the earlier films... here, thanks to Cuaron's more introspective eye, the performances become more vital. Unfortunately, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry and Emma Watson as Hermoine don't seem quite ready to play the scenes as naturally and realistically as they should be.Also, the storyline of PRISONER OF AZKABAN doesn't feel as complete as the earlier two films. AZKABAN works much better then the other two in terms of developing character and getting the ball rolling for more compelling films later in the series... however as a film it doesn't stand on it's own quite as well as the others.Despite that fact, HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN is still a highly entertaining film. And once the action really gets rolling near the films climax it get really good. In the end, thanks to Cuaron, AZKABAN is a great improvement stylistically over the other films and a great transition into the next films.... B+ ...",8,0,1,26 May 2006
Batman Begins," BATMAN BEGINS : Starts An Entirely New Franchise Off On The Right Foot...
","BATMAN BEGINS Personally, I don't loathe the final installments in the BATMAN series as much as others have. I can enjoy BATMAN FOREVER and BATMAN & ROBIN for the ridiculously over-the-top popcorn films they are... while also enjoying the campy badness of them. And I've always been a die-hard fan of Burton's films, especially BATMAN RETURNS.So, for me, BATMAN BEGINS was not necessarily the pheonix rising from the ashes of a dead franchise to the same extent as it was for other people... but it's still a pretty damn good movie.The movie follows the origins of Bruce Wayne and his evolution towards becoming Batman with much more detail. By taking his history, and giving more 'real-world' validity to Batman's powers, supplies, and batcave give the film a more gritty thrill.I was nervous that the lack of outlandish villains would be disappointing to me. My favorite part of every other Batman film has been the over-the-top villains. Here though, chief enemies are Rahj-An-Guhl (an incredibly skilled fighter with an army of his trainees), Carmine Falcon (Gotham's leading crime boss), and Dr. Jonathan Crane (the man who will become The Scarecrow).Christopher Nolan's script and direction managed to draw me in anyway. Despite my resistance to enjoy a Batman movie without fantastical villains, Nolan has made up for it with a detailed story that is more gripping than any previous film. Batman is not just a hero in this film, but a man on a personal mission. Never before has Bruce Wayne's internal drive been captured like it has here by Nolan and Christian Bale's performance.Overall, every performance in this film helps to escalate the quality. It was hard to tell on occasion if all the characters were so strong when simply on the page, or if it was due to the fact that Nolan has hired some of today's best actors to bring more substance and weight to more thankless roles. The stand-outs for me were Cillian Murphy (chilling as Dr. Crane/The Scarecrow) and Tom Wilkinson (reaching a darkness that I've never seen from him before). However, the work from Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, and Morgan Freeman deserve credit too. The only slight weakness was Katie Holmes simply because she didn't surpass her material (the Razzie nod is ridiculous though).The first hour of the film focuses heavily on Bruce Wayne's disappearance into foreign prisons and foreign lands where he gains the training necessary for his mission. This section is also blended in with flashbacks to Bruce's life with his parents. Overall, this was the weakest part of the film for me.I appreciatted the effect and depth it gave the rest of the film, but I feel like it could have moved a little quicker in the beginning. And some of the scenes of Bruce as a child didn't quite work for me. Especially the murder of Wayne's parents. What should have been an emotionally shattering scene fell far short. I didn't get a sense of how terrifying and life altering that moment was for Bruce. The moment just wasn't strong enough for me to fully represent the catalyst that defined Bruce's future.Aside from these flaws though, this film was great entertainment... with more depth than is usually expected from a superhero franchise. Instead of embracing the comic-whimsy that recent SPIDERMAN films have done, Nolan's BATMAN BEGINS embraces and fuels the darkness that haunts Bruce and his beloved city.And congratulations of having one of the best teaser-endings prepping for a sequel that I've seen in a long-long while. Despite the few flaws, I definitely can't wait for more of Nolan and Bale's BATMAN.... B ...",8,0,0,19 February 2006
Cars," CARS : Not Pixar's Best, But Still Better Then Many Movies Today...
","CARS It's dangerous to do what Pixar has done over the past few years. If you build up an empire and flawless reputation for producing some of the best films released in modern years... inevitably something has got to give. Leading up to its release, it looked like CARS could potentially be that film. Trailers weren't as awe-inspiring as they've been the past, the story looked a little cliché, and the concept seemed a bit forced. And along with the inevitable fall of the empire, there's no doubt going to be people looking to bring you down... or at least people who have come to expect sooooo much from you that they will inevitably be disappointed. Personally, I think CARS is suffering that fate.And it's a shame, because CARS is far from being a 'disappointment'. Pixar's latest CGI-film tells the story of Lightning McQueen (voiced by Owen Wilson), a stuck up race car with nothing on his mind besides his own pride and glory. While en route to the final race for the Piston Cup, Lightning McQueen gets himself lost and in trouble in the abandoned city of 'Radiator Springs'. What was once a thriving stop on Route 66 has now become a resting place for a group of rag tag vehicles. They include the reclusive leader Doc Hudson (Paul Newman), Mater (Larry the Cable Guy), and Sally the Porsche (Bonnie Hunt). Initially, Lightning couldn't possibly get out of 'Radiator Springs' fast enough... however, as time goes by Lightning begins to realize the importance of slowing down and admiring the scenery.True, the story is the most familiar of all the Pixar films yet... and it's not given as many layers as past screenplays had. Also, at times the story lags a bit more then others. The film is never boring, although it seems the producers were wasting a little time building up some minor characters that ultimately didn't effect the story that much. Yet still, CARS is an endearingly light-hearted tale of enjoying the simple things in life, so why shouldn't the story be simple as well? It might lower the prestige of CARS, but not necessarily it's entertainment value.In terms of providing it's audience with a good time, Pixar still has not failed. CARS opens at a stadium filled with vehicles of all type doing waves, cheering, flashing the crowd, and more as the first major race for the Piston Cup takes place. It is in this opening sequence where Pixar really gets to showcase their skills as computer artists. The gleaming lights off the hoods of the race-cars, the details all the way down to the little pebbles on the racetrack, and the highly detailed background are just a few of things in this movie that truly impress. All the more impressive, these visual elements are blended in with sound editing and effects that match the very best in film today. All these factors combine to create some of the most exciting footage of race-cars captured on film, fake or not.Pixar also shows they are still the masters of finding visual gags and slapstick humor without having to resort to pop-culture references and crude humor. Whereas most animated films today evoke their humor from 'hip' and 'edgy' pop-culture (SHREK, OVER THE HEDGE, and ICE AGE are all guilty of this... though they are still entertaining movies). Pixar's ability to evoke humor from the actual storyline instead of the outside world is what will ensure their films remain fresh and funny forever. They have managed to make films that will never feel dated. My personal favorite gags in this film came when we saw the Cars in their natural environments... on the roads cruising.The voice-work in CARS is a fun addition as well. Though the limitation of having all the characters by automobiles limits the variety of characters that was welcoming through TOY STORY, BUGS LIFE and more... the actors still manage to infuse their characters with a distinct heart. Larry the Cable Guy, though probably the least gifted actor of the bunch, manages to come off best in a perfect marriage of voice-actor and machine.Overall, CARS is possibly the best piece of family entertainment to be released this year. It seems unfair that a film with as many good elements as Pixar's CARS get deemed a 'disappointment' simply because it can't meet the insane standards set up by the studio's last few films. Who cares if the movie is stretched a little bit longer then it needs to be... it's not like we get enough Pixar anyway! And who cares if it's a little less impressive then past efforts... it's still a worth addition to Pixar's credits and it shows they are continuing to develop in the visuals department! In the end, while CARS isn't close to being the best Pixar film yet, it is certainly the best animated film I've seen all year... and for that it deserves the credit it would receive whether it was being compared to past Pixar films or not....

X-Men: The Last Stand," X-MEN - THE LAST STAND : All The Action I've Been Waiting For Packaged Really Well!...
","X-MEN : THE LAST STAND I have waited and waited since childhood for them to make X-MEN into a film franchise. As a kid, I collected the comic books, the collecting cards (with complete collections still perfectly organized in binders might I add), and the action figures... pretty much anything X-MEN I could get my hands on. I literally used to fall asleep trying to figure out what celebrity should play which character in a movie and hoping that one day I would get to see the story told on the big screen. Just a few years ago my dream came true (starring the man I always wanted for Professor X)... but only now has an X-MEN film fully captured what I was looking for on the big screen.On many levels, X2:X-MEN UNITED is the best film of the series. It creates a more socially important theme and utilizes it in telling the story with an emotional weight far deeper then those found in the original X-MEN and in the recent THE LAST STAND. However, X-MEN:THE LAST STAND offers up the one element that I always wanted to see more of on the big screen... mutants in an actual battle.While the first two films delved more deeply into the social element of X-MEN, they never fully captured the cinematic possibilities of having the mutants battle it out against one another in an all out war of their powers. Finally, I got what I was looking for in the thrilling final third of X-MEN:THE LAST STAND.X-MEN:THE LAST STAND acts as one big build-up to a climactic battle of mutants... however, it's filled with so many nods to the comic book, so much spectacle, tons of action, and quality performances that it still holds it's audience captivated. I will admit that the narrative of X2 far exceeds anything we see here, but call me a sucker for action scenes b/c nonetheless I was won over by THE LAST STAND. In the years since X2 ended, a cure has been developed that will supposedly rid mutants of their power. At first, the cure is offered up voluntarily to mutants looking to live a 'normal' life. However, the simple existence of this cure shakes the balance of mutant-hood everywhere. Some secretly desire the cure, some are offended by the mere idea of it, and others believe it is nothing more than the first step in mutant extermination. Magneto (played by Ian McKellen) is the leader of those who believe it is the beginning of an extermination, and with the help of his Brotherhood of Evil Mutants he plans to attack and destroy all humans who look to stand in the way of mutant development.Meanwhile, he is aided by the help of a reborn Jean Grey (played by Famke Jansen)... now known as the Dark Pheonix. The Dark Pheonix is awoken from her slumber beneath the lake as the most powerful mutant on earth. Her powers are so strong they can't even be controlled by Professor X (played by Patrick Stewart) or the Pheonix herself. Along with her powers comes an evil nature completely unlike the Jean Grey the X-Men once knew, and now the Pheonix has sided with Magneto's Brotherhood against the X-Men.To tell the truth, the movie has so much plot going for it that it could have justified a running time far longer then the 1 hour and 40 minute running time it currently has. In addition to the above mentioned points, there is the introduction of Beast (played by Kelsey Grammar in an unconventional role), the introduction of Angel (played by Ben Foster, in a truly underused role), and many other mutants. With a longer running time, this film could have explored the cultural ramifications of mutants and the effects that has on their lives much more deeply... and perhaps that would have given the film even more of a resonance. As is the film works wonderfully as popcorn entertainment with just enough intelligence.What makes it better than the other films for me is the excitement of it all. Though I admired and enjoyed the other films and their focus on character over action... the X-MEN franchise needed a big jolt of action to show the potential these characters have. One of the best aspects of the film is the fact that the character of Storm (played very-well by Halle Berry) has finally been given ample screen time. Not only do we get to see her fly and actually fight hard, but we also get to see the character finally become the leader she always should have been. To add strength to the action scenes, Brett Ratner (who I will admit does not bring as much to the table as Bryan Singer did) manages to keep some focus on the relationships and dynamics between the X-Men and he keeps the film grounded somewhat even as it goes further and further into realms of implausibility.My overall opinion on the film is hard to put into a brief review. It was an experience where I got to watch something similar to what I've always pictured in my mind since childhood... and so clearly it kept my fully absorbed and invested the whole time. Sure, some of the plot developments (some of which are truly shocking) weren't my ideal choices in terms of the future of the series... and there were certainly plot holes and moments where I would be thinking 'why don't they just do this'. But bottom line, I loved the film.... A-...",10,4,8,2 June 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," GOOD NIGHT & GOOD LUCK : Ambitious, Respectable, & Quite Disappointing...
","GOOD NIGHT & GOOD LUCK Wow what a disappointment. GOOD NIGHT & GOOD LUCK was the last film of the Best Picture nominees that I had to see, and it was my last chance to see a nominee that I could truly, passionately admire. Unfortunately, GOOD NIGHT & GOOD LUCK was nowhere close to my favorite film of the year.I can admire some elements of GN&GL, and it's definitely a well-crafted film. It is beautifully shot with possibly the best ensemble cast I've seen in a film this year. George Clooney has combined the visual style of his film and the emotional lives of his ensemble to create a beautifully naturalistic world.This ensemble really mingles like people living their lives. It doesn't read like a bunch of actors performing opposite each other, there was a genuine sense of camaraderie, respect, and individualism that naturally exuded from the group scenes. These were probably the highlights of the film for me.The film focuses on Edward R. Murrow, played with incredible nuanced restraint and subtlety by David Strathairn. His mission and work are the only parts of his character we ever gain insight to, and David Strathairn plays it all to a tee.However, aside from some great performances, a wonderful visual style, and a couple exciting moments... GN&GL didn't even feel like a movie to me.While I did find it's brisk running time to be a good asset, the way that running time was utilized left me confused. It seemed that only an hour of this film was actually a movie. The other half-hour consisted of documentary footage and silent montages set to period music. It seemed like so much time was wasted in creating a mood and getting the facts out that the actual people in the newsroom because an afterthought.While I admire a director who refuses to follow certain Hollywood 'rules' in storytelling, Clooney's method of minimalization just didn't work for me. In the same way that Spielberg's MUNICH was hurt by it's 'neutral' stance... Clooney's film is hurt by it's 'minimalistic & neutral' stance. It never gives enough insight into the characters and therefore never gives their story much emotional heft.When I left the theatre, I felt like I was stupid for not really appreciatting the movie. As if, b/c I didn't really get into the story, I must just be too inexperienced and unfamiliar with the story behind McCarthy to really get the film.Maybe that is the case, and I certainly think if I was more familiar with the McCarthy era I would have found the film more interesting. But it seems Clooney directed this movie with only the people who knew this era as his intended audience. However, for me and my tastes the film felt empty... and the ending completely anti-climatic.GOOD NIGHT & GOOD LUCK is an effort I respect, but also one that I truly didn't appreciatte or enjoy....

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY : Might Not Be Gene Wilder, But Still Lots Of Fun...
","CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY The main thing I admired about this version of Roald Dahl's classic is that it clearly set out to find it's own visual style and overall tone when compared to the classic '72 Gene Wilder version. Tim Burton creates an ambiguously surreal world for young Charlie (Freddie Highmore), the young boy who visits Willy Wonka's famous chocolate factory. This skewed reality allows Burton to create captivating visuals in every situation, whether it is in the grand scale candy room and chocolate river... or whether it is the mere visualization of Augustus Gloop's obsessive chocolate intake.Everything in the film is stylized, and I loved that aspect. Every child has one element that is played up to a much more dramatic extreme in this one versus the original... and it works. The children are honestly the best part of the film. The performances aren't as nuanced or natural as those of the original children... but they are more distinctly defined. These children obviously all went over the top to play to their stereotypes, but they all kept it natural and fluid enough that I never lost interest. This might be the finest ensemble of child actors I have seen in a long while. I loved every one of the kids in this version more so than in the original.However, some elements Burton seemed to add to differentiate his film, though admirable, just don't managed to be as good as they once were. The oompa-loompas are nothing short of incredibly disappointing. Their songs lack the humor and straightforwardness... lyrics are barely understandable... and there is so much action going on that any element of humor in these songs is impossible to catch. Also, the demise of some of the children is made too grand. Violet turning into a blueberry used to be the simple image of a young girl waddling about, and it was hysterical... here, the computer imagery and confusion with the Oompaloompas is just a bit too much.The only other major flaw of the film is an incredibly mediocre and disappointing performance from Depp. From the previews I thought his interpretation would make me mad the entire time... it didn't. I bought into his approach and went with it, but I was never won over. Gene Wilder managed to make Willy Wonka the comedic center-point of the film... always holding the audience's attention in the palm of his hand. Depp just kind of blends into the visual spectacle that surrounds him and gets lost. Whenever the film tried to focus on his character (with that insufferable back story with his father... this part just dragged the movie to a screeching halt any time it came up) I was simply wishing for more of the children.Overall, although their were disappointing moments... on a whole the film had me completely interested. I loved the kids, and thankfully they are the focus of most of the picture. Tim Burton's visuals were beautiful and unique... and the movie constantly supplies it's audience with a fun/harmless/visual treat.WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY will for me be the classic version of the Roald Dahl book forever... however the new CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY deserves it's own viewing, and it's own fan base. It's simple minded fun with enough going on to keep any audience interested. Just don't expect the perfection of the original.... B- ...PS - The film gets bonus points for showing what happened to the kids once they left the factory. This was one of my favorite moments.",7,0,2,15 January 2006
Pride & Prejudice," PRIDE & PREJUDICE : Keira Knightley Illuminates The Screen In Joe Wright's Beautiful Debut...
","PRIDE & PREJUDICE Joe Wright's PRIDE & PREJUDICE is an example of how lush and indulgent a film can be with it visuals, while still balancing a perfectly told story. It's an exemplary retelling of an unquestionably classic story, well suited to today's audience, yet never 'giving in' to the demands of modern audience.By steering clear of romanticizing the story and it's setting, Joe Wright has made Jane Austen's classic all the more compelling. The beauty does not entirely lie in the lavish gowns and perfectly decorated houses, it lies in the lifestyles of it's characters. The interaction between the Bennet family... their desire to use the little finances they have and make a luxurious living... their longing for true love, and the list goes on and on.Incredible camera tricks are used to show the passage of time, and they never feel gimmicky or out of place. Overall, this is an incredible debut for a director that shows promise to become a major force in revitalizing the genre of classic literature put on film.The story evolves around the Bennet family, a middle class family with a mother desperately trying to marry off her 5 daughters despite the lack of a dowry. Though we watch the romantic and social activities of all the daughters, the focus lies in the tumultuous courting of Elizabeth Bennet (played beautifully by the stunning Keira Knightly) by the rigid Mr. Darcy (Matthew McFadyen).Though the story the center story of Elizabeth and Darcy seems to travel slowly to an inevitable conclusion, the twists and turns that bring us their offer plenty of surprises. And the witty dialogue and dynamite performances managed to keep me guessing as to how these two would ever end up together.Aside from Joe Wright's direction (and perhaps to be attributed to his direction), the performances of the entire ensemble is perfection. Brenda Blethyn as the matriarchal Mrs. Bennet does exactly what Blethyn always does... but she does it perfectly here. Donald Sutherland brings a serenity to the film with his calm and charming performance as Mr. Bennet. And credit must be given to Matthew McFadyen for taking the role of Mr. Darcy (a role many people argue to be perfectly captured by Colin Firth in the BBC version) and capturing the cold nature of his outer personality, while also conveying the sensitive, lonely, and socially awkward man struggling on the inside.However, the film unquestionably belongs to Keira Knightley. She has the perfect combination of talented actress and ethereal charm and beauty... with a pinch of tom-boyishness. The eyes are drawn to her in every scene she's in, and half the time I couldn't realize if it was because I was just stunned by her looks or if I was just completely invested into her pin-point portrayal. Only after leaving the theatre did I realize it was for both of those reasons. Every aspect of her performance works, and thankfully Knightley received the Academy Award nomination that her performance certainly merits.For 2 hours, Joe Wright and his leading lady managed to take PRIDE & PREJUDICE, a piece of classic literature that never interested me, and make me a fan of Jane Austen. Hats off to a job well done, and I can't wait to see what's next in store from this talented director.... A- ...",9,1,3,3 February 2006
Invincible," INVINCIBLE: Refreshingly Not 'Schmaltzy' & Entertaining... But Nothing Spectacular
","INVINCIBLE Here we have Disney offering up another family-friendly, inspirational movie about football in the tradition of REMEMBER THE TITANS. This time it tells the story of Vincent Papale (played by Mark Whalberg), an average-joe bartender in Philadelphia who manages to land a spot on the Philadelphia Eagles by attending an open call. After making it into training with the losing sports team, Papale must fight to keep up with the pros and prove he not only has what it takes to earn a spot on the team... but he has what it takes to make them winners.INVINCIBLE follows the many clichés one can expect from a sports movie like this. Every character has a redemption, everything feels uplifting, and everything is going to work out in the end with a climactic football game. However, INVINCIBLE manages to utilize all those clichés without ever getting overtly sappy.The usual downfall of an 'uplifting' movie is that it constantly teeters back and forth between schmaltzy and genuinely compelling territory. INVINCIBLE manages to remain on the 'genuinely compelling' side longer then the 'schmaltzy' side and a great deal of that belongs to the director and his star.Ericson Core, in his feature-film directorial debut, manages to find camera tricks that capture the football field in ways I've never seen before. Especially compelling is his opening scan over a crowded snowy parking lot as the camera makes it's way over to the field. Aside from interesting camera-work, Core manages to keep the tone realistic at most times, keeping his actors from over-emoting or playing scenes for maximum emotional impact. There's a subtlety here that kept me from every feeling manipulated... for example, we're spared the cliché final monologue of motivational excess.Mark Whalberg proves again that he is a better actor then many people give him credit for. He has always excelled at playing an honest everyman with honest aspirations for success. He did it in BOOGIE NIGHTS, ROCK STAR (yes, I liked it), and now here. Whalberg's acting style mixes perfectly with Core's tone. Whalberg has never been an actor who seems to be overplaying his emotions... as a matter of fact, he often underplays them in this film. Letting all his anger, all his happiness remain very internal. As a result, Whalberg's Papale feels more like a real person then a puppet used to draw tears from it's audience.Nonetheless, despite it's quality production, INVINCIBLE remains incredibly predictable. And though it succeeds at never over-playing it's emotions... it also doesn't manage to really thrill the audience either. I found myself entertained by INVINCIBLE but not necessarily moved. Overall, it's a good effort and all performers do good work... but INVINCIBLE, though solid and entertaining, is not a stand-out in the genre.... B- ...",7,0,1,30 August 2006
The Descent," THE DESCENT : Incredibly Scary... Please Have All Horror Movies Made By Foreign Directors!
","THE DESCENTFinally, for the first time since 28 DAYS LATER a horror movie has come along that filled me with genuine fear. THE DESCENT is hands down the best horror movie released in recent years, and though it features a great deal of gore and violence, it refreshingly does not draw it's largest scares from these elements. THE DESCENT is a brilliantly shot film that captures the idea of claustrophobic insanity perfectly. Perhaps it's no coincidence that the two best horror films of the past decade have had their origins outside of the United States, and it's time for American film-makers to look past the 'slasher' clichés.THE DESCENT tells the story of a group of friends who have experienced an enormous tragedy just one summer ago. One year later, in an attempt to move on, a group of females choose to go on an expedition traveling through an ominous cave located in the middle of nowhere. It starts out as planned, a vacation that re-affirms friendships and shows signs of new hope in their lives. However, as they go deeper and deeper into the earth, things get more and more terrifying. THE DESCENT leaves the remainder of it's story open for interpretation. As the girls begin to realize they are not alone in the caves, it is not 100% clear as to whether the bat creatures that hunt them are real or if they are representations of one character's slow descent into insanity. However, either way you interpret this (and I still haven't made up my mind), director Neil Marshall keeps his film constantly frightening.For me personally, the scariest part of THE DESCENT comes before any monsters arrive. Through brilliant lighting, camera-work, and direction, this film manages to makes it's audience feel the claustrophobia to an uncomfortable extent. The sequences in which the girls must crawl on their elbows through passageways that have dust constantly falling from the roof made me physically uncomfortable. Often times we see nothing more then the beam of light from a flashlight and the jagged rocks it passes over. And yet, despite the limited options for scenery, Marshall manages to keep the film feeling alive. It never drones on or gets boring b/c of the small environment, instead it thrives.Then when the monsters do appear, Marshall lets the blood fly. However, it is never the blood and gore that offer the real thrills. While films like SAW and HOSTEL relied completely on disgusting their audience to incite fear, THE DESCENT merely uses the gore to emphasize the terror, not create it. What's also very cool is the amount of references you can find in THE DESCENT to many of the greatest horror films in history, including:THE SHINING - as the girls drive up the mountain to the cave entranceCARRIE - as one character rises from a pool of blood, it's unmistakably similar to the prom sceneSILENCE OF THE LAMBS - the use of night-vision goggles while in the caves28 DAYS LATER - waking in the hospital in the very beginning of the movieThere were more but I can't remember them too well b/c my mind was so engrossed in the movie. Clocking in at a brisk 99 minutes, THE DESCENT packs the kind of punch far too many horror films don't. It scares it's audience while also engrossing them into a gripping emotional story (not to mention the fact that the cast offers strong performances). Also, it can be enjoyed as either a mindless thrill ride, or an incredibly complex examination of mental insanity. It's a shame the film isn't finding a larger audience here in the states while films like WHEN A STRANGER CALLS can be the equivalent of a cinematic fart and still open at #1. However, I would place my bets on the fact that THE DESCENT will go on to continually find a larger audience in subsequent years... perhaps even becoming a cult film of sorts. It's simply too good to not be remembered as an incredible horror film.... A- ...",10,7,13,24 August 2006
The Da Vinci Code," THE DAVINCI CODE : Ron Howard's Numerous Mistakes Make For A Big Disappointment
","THE DAVINCI CODE It took me a while to get out to the theaters to see this one because I wanted to be sure I'd finished reading the book first. From the very first previews for this film, I had faith it was going to be good. I'd yet to even read one page of the best-selling novel and yet Ron Howard's trailers had me enticed from day one. I was able to put aside my disappointment for Ron Howard's past film-work and believe he might have finally created a great film. And after reading the book, there was no doubt in my mind the source material was wonderful. Unfortunately, Ron Howard failed in all the same ways he has in the past... and his adaptation of THE DAVINCI CODE is one big, clunky disappointment.Granted, to adapt a book with so many complications and so many different characters would have been a challenge for anyone... however, the results could have been much better. The film tells the story of Robert Langdon (played by a miscast Tom Hanks) and Sophie Neveu (played by a miscast Audrey Tatou) as they scramble to unearth the secret of the Holy Grail following the murder of Neveu's grandfather. In the moments before his death, Neveu's grandfather left numerous clues which would lead his granddaughter towards a family secret that would shock the world.It's impossible to review THE DAVINCI CODE without comparing it to the superior book. Perhaps that's unfair, but if the book was such a daunting thing to be compared to... why did Howard stick so close to it? I felt throughout the entire film that Howard and the production team weren't quite sure what to do with the movie. Should they make a faithful adaptation even though it would be difficult, or should they re-arrange the story a bit to make it more cinematic...? It appears they never made a decision and just straddled that line throughout the entire development process.Sadly, it appears things were off from the very start. Though Tom Hanks can usually handle any type of role, he is radically out of place in this film. He appears to be too old... and not so much in age, but in body. I never got the sense that finding the Holy Grail filled Langdon/Hanks with a wild curiosity and intense desire like it should have. Instead, Hanks just seemed to be going through the motions. And the same can be said for Tatou's performance as Sophie Neveu. Firstly, she is too young for the role. Secondly, Neveu needed to be the emotional centerpiece for the film when you consider how Howard chose to end things, and yet Tatou's performance didn't have a single extra layer to it. She seemed to be a beautiful shell of a Cryptologist who knows she must figure out the mystery... yet she appears to have no passionate need to know the truth. Without Langdon and Neveu's desperation, none of this mystery is exciting.The other major casting mistake was Paul Bettany as Silas. While Silas does not necessarily need to look like a monstrosity, he definitely should not be attractive. Yet, nothing is done to downplay Bettany's natural good looks. Sure there are scratches all over his body and he's white as a sheet, but his body is sculpted beautifully and his face normal. And why may I ask did an Albino have blue eyes? All albinos have no pigmentation in their eyes leaving them a red-ish color... so why did Bettany keep blue eyes which only added to the physical attractiveness? Aside from the casting however, Howard's input does nothing to save the film. Instead, Ron Howard uses identical gimmicks as he has in the past (the code breaking in this film is stylized exactly the same as it was in A BEAUTIFUL MIND). In general the film just feels like its spread out too evenly without any significant dips or lulls in the action. In the book, the race between Langdon and the French Police seemed to be an ever shifting game of cat & mouse. In Dan Brown's novel, the police would get closer and closer only to fall back moments later... but in Howard's film, the police seem to be 10 minutes behind our heroes right up until the very end.Finally, I don't think Ron Howard or Brian Grazer ever sat down at the very beginning of things and firmly decided exactly what perspective they were going to tell this story from. Is he simply telling the story of an interesting mystery? Is he offering an emotional tale of an abandoned child who yearns to know where they came from? Is he telling the story of man's obsession with knowing the truth? I think Howard tried to tell them all... and as a result he has an unfocused film on his hands.It's hard to pin-point specific things that went wrong with the film... b/c in the end it isn't one specific element that ruined what could have been one of Cinema's most thrilling mysteries ever. It is the entire mixture. The casting is wrong, the direction poorly paced, the story too impersonal, and the mystery too unclear. While THE DAVINCI CODE has a few redeeming factors, such as Ian McKellen's engaging turn as Lee Teabing and some wonderful scenery, it is far too much of a disappointment when you consider the potential. In the end, although it's not the most boring 2 1/2 hours of my life by any means... I could never get past the fact that nothing in it is as good as it could have been. And when the most constant word in your head while watching a movie is 'disappointment', then it's not a good sign.... D ...",3,0,1,20 June 2006
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," SORCERER'S STONE : An Underwhelming But Adequate Kick-Off To The Franchise...
","HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE The first film in the blockbuster 'Harry Potter' franchise has suffered by comparison to all the films that have come out since. With each HARRY POTTER film that is released, the films seem to become more fully stylized. They've also managed to become far more organic than SORCERER'S STONE... which now comes across gimmicky and elementary by comparison.HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE tells the very introductory story of Harry's first year at Hogwarts where he only begins to discover the secrets of his hidden past and the complicated inner-workings of his new home. By nature, this is a more simplistic and superficial story then the recent films (GOBLET OF FIRE & PRISONER OF AZKABAN). It doesn't really delve into the histories of the characters and more so acts as an extended introduction.Though this first film has it's strengths, it's clear it was hurt by the direction of Christopher Columbus. The special effects are impressive still and the story is still compelling, but Columbus' packaging still manages to make things drag at times. While the story could have merited a 2 1/2 hour running time, unfortunately the film Columbus directed does not. The film could have been more tightly constructed and come in under 2 hours... leaving it with a brisker pace.The children's performances' are adequate. As a matter of fact, for me personally, the only aspect of this franchise that has not improved with age so much is the capabilities of the young actors in the central roles. While I have always enjoyed Rupert Grint's performance as Ron Weasley, I have always found Daniel Radcliffe's Harry and Emma Watson's Hermoine to be a little underwhelming. However, at such young ages as the children were while making this film... they do a passable job.The real energy and joy of this first film though comes from the energy and sheer excitement invested into the lesser supporting roles. By gathering the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Richard Harris, Robbie Coltrane, Fionnulla Shaw, and many others... the film has handfuls of fully realized and wildly imaginative supporting players adorning the screen at all times. Their performances along with the action sequences (the final rescue of the Sorcerer's Stone, the Quidditch Match, etc.) are what manage to keep the audience's attention despite the poor direction from Christopher Columbus.Overall, though this film is a slight disappointment considering the phenomenal material it's based on... it's not a complete mess. It's still entertaining (if overlong) and most importantly, it does leave you anxious to find out what more happens to these characters. As a stand-alone film HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERER'S STONE has many flaws... but it successfully grabs it's audience and leaves them wanting more. Thanks to this quality, the film kick-started a film franchise that only improves with age.... B- ...",7,1,2,19 May 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," GOBLET OF FIRE : They Keep Getting Better...
","HARRY POTTER & THE GOBLET OF FIRE I have found these films to be enjoyable ever since THE SORCERER'S STONE, and yet I still continue to be surprised by how much they are able to continually strengthen the visual style, and tighten up the books in more appropriately cinematic ways with each passing film. GOBLET OF FIRE is superior to the earlier works and yet it still fits in very well with the preceding films.The film is a visual feast. The Quidditch match in the very beginning is beautifully portrayed, and Newell handles every elaborate sequence (virtually every round of the tournament, though especially the underwater segment in my eyes) with a confident, and selective eye.However, what was most incredible to me was the way that Newell managed to take something as simple as a boot (the turnkey) in the very beginning, and make it my favorite image in the movie. As the camera chases the Weasleys, Potter, and Hermoine up the hill rolling through the grass towards a beautiful sunset... only to finish the shot on a tattered shoe. It captures perfectly how magical Potter's world is, yet also how simple.The screenwriter deserves massive amounts of respect for condensing the book in a major way (and I loved the book when I read it 3 years ago)... however, he never loses the central theme of the novel or it's main narrative drive (having not read the book for a while and not remembering the specifics, I barely noticed anything missing b/c I was kept so involved). He also manages to balance out the dark/tragic elements in the end with the lighthearted innocence of children in school perfectly, never does one tone feel detrimental to the other.The adult performers always manage to do strong work with their small roles. I still view Watson, Grint, and Radcliffe as less then stellar actors... in every film I feel like I am watching them mimic EXACTLY what the director had to INSTRUCT them to do (I just don't feel like they really live and breath the characters, I always see a wheel turning). But, they look the parts, are enjoyable to watch, and I think they continue to slightly improve in each film.In the end though, this isn't a film that I go to in order to admire the performances. It is a popcorn flick, however one done with a lot of artistry. The plot developments are exciting, the characters are amusing, the imagery is beautiful, the action sequences thrilling, and the story engrossing.Highly entertaining... and the best POTTER film so far....

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," CHAMBER OF SECRETS : A Great Improvement On The First Film...
","HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS In terms of the Harry Potter books, 'Chamber Of Secrets' is probably the most light-hearted book in the series. It covers very little ground in terms of offering background on Hogwart's legacy and it doesn't necessarily establish central themes of the entire series... however, it is arguably the most fun. 'Harry Potter & The Chamber Of Secrets' was a large step up in quality from the first film in the series, and it is without a doubt Chris Columbus' best film to date.It tells the story of Harry's second year at Hogwarts. The school is beginning to be terrorized by an unknown monster that is supposedly being controlled by the Heir Of Slytherin. The Chamber Of Secrets, a mysterious cave that's whereabouts are unknown to all of Hogwart's staff, has been opened causing students to be 'petrified'. On top of all this, Harry has started to hear strange noises coming from the walls and he's the only one who can hear it. Harry and his friends Ron Weasley and Hermoine Granger set out to figure out the mystery behind the Chamber Of Secrets and the voices in Harry's head.What makes the second film so much better then the first film is that it remains focused on the story it is telling. Whereas 'The Sorcerer's Stone' tried to incorporate more of the fan's favorite moments from the books that ultimately didn't serve the plots... 'Chamber Of Secrets' edits out all the extraneous material. So although some fans will ultimately be disappointed that certain chapters from the book are missing, the film is far more exciting and cohesive because of it.By remaining focused on the storyline, all the action scenes are given more excitement. Whereas the first movie used special effects for flash and spectacle (the flying lesson, the shifting staircases, etc.), this film utilizes the special effects to offer more scares and thrills only when the story calls for it. All sequences (ranging from the Spider Pit, to the flying car, to the finale) are handled much better and therefore, 'Chamber Of Secrets' never lags like the first one.Performances from the supporting cast are solid as ever, with Richard Harris offering a wonderful final performance as Dumbledore. Kenneth Brannagh also makes an especially entertaining addition to the ensemble. Brannagh plays Gilderoy Lockhart, the arrogant new Defense Against The Dark Arts teacher, and he obviously has fun really digging into the vanity of this character. Also, Jason Isaacs makes a wonderfully threatening villain as Draco Malfoy's father.The children still don't quite nail their roles for me... but they are still young. The only actor that really captures his character is Rupert Grint as Ron. I just sense that Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are more tentative when it comes to their roles... whereas Rupert Grint both understands his character and is willing to have fun with him. However, Daniel Radcliffe does do an admirable job of helping bring the CGI character Doby to convincing life. Doby remains one of the only CGI characters in movies (aside from Peter Jackson's films... where Gollum and Kong were phenomenal additions) that adds to the film instead of detracts.Overall, 'Harry Potter & The Chamber Of Secrets' is the most commercially enjoyable film of Chris Columbus' 'Potter' films. And even though a little more artistic integrity probably could have been added by a more experienced and gifted direct, I think 'Chamber Of Secrets' stands up against time and the more recent films in the franchise....

Wedding Crashers," WEDDING CRASHERS : Brilliant Movie, Minus 25 Excessive Minutes...
","WEDDING CRASHERSFirst off, Vince Vaughn is an incredibly talented comedian. Watching the films he makes now, it's amazing to think that he ever played a role like Norman Bates in the remake of PSYCHO. His rapid fire comedic ramblings have really helped drive him into being one of todays best screen comedians.In this film, he is paired up with a game, if not as funny, Owen Wilson. THE WEDDING CRASHERS was one of the biggest comedy hits of this past year, and deservedly so. At times the film had a completely raunchy sense of humor akin to THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and ANIMAL HOUSE, yet it maintains a gloss and intelligence throughout that I think sets it ahead of those movies.I've always found SOMETHING ABOUT MARY and ANIMAL HOUSE to be incredible comedies, but flawed b/c they never grabbed me and made me care about the plot. WEDDING CRASHERS managed to play out a convincing love story while never losing it's wild edge.Much credit belongs to Rachel McAdams for perfectly embodying the perfect girl in this film. She's gorgeous, approachable, fun, sexy, and a challenge all at once. I've yet to see THE NOTEBOOK and THE FAMILY STONE, but between this and MEAN GIRLS, it's obvious the girl is incredibly talented. Isla Fisher offers manic comedic support as her sister and has great chemistry with Vaughn.The main problem I've read about the film is it's length... and it is indeed unnecessarily long. Basically, it was obvious how things would end up from the very beginning... and yet the film drags on for about 25 minutes too long in the end trying to create suspense. In the end, this doesn't really add anything to the 'love story' aspect. In fact, it lets the film drift too far into a corny place where it never should have gone. On top of that, I would like to note that throwing Will Ferrell and his over the top antics into a movie in the last 20 minutes is pointless, and kind of annoying. Ferrell is incredibly funny in the right context... here, he's a nuisance. Also, some subplots and characters are severely underdeveloped. The weird brother and Jane Seymour's character showed up at random moments for blatant laughs, and they are funny. But they just seem to pop up whenever convenient... and in a comedy so well developed, their characters seem like mere plot tricks to conjure up a few more laughs.Overall though, despite the length, the film maintained my interest and had me laughing harder than any other film has in a long time. Best Moments - * The dinner table conversations * Vaughn tied to the bed * The opening wedding montageSlightly flawed... but it's a comedy, not a perfect film. For what it aims to do, it nearly hits the bullseye. Unfortunately the director didn't leave Will Ferrell and the last 25 minutes and the editing room floor.... B+ ...",8,0,0,6 January 2006
Munich," MUNICH : A Powerful Message, Packaged In A Mixed-Up Movie...
","MUNICH Steven Spielberg's latest work-of-passion is incredibly well constructed in many respects, but there's a lingering sense of 'something's missing here' that kept me from ever feeling affected by what was going on in front of me.In the aftermath of the 1972 Munich Olympics incident, an Israeli man named Avram (played with a heartfelt honesty by Eric Bana) is hired to lead a team of 5 men in assassinating the 11 men who had helped to organize the terrorist attacks. Avram and the men embark on their mission with a patriotic optimism, but as the time passes and the death toll increases, they all must confront what violence does to both them and also to further their countries cause.To make a film that analyzes both the necessity and the pointlessness of violence is an incredibly ambitious topic for Steven Spielberg to cover. Adding to the difficulty is his approach of keeping every character in a grey area. There is no black & white when it comes to who the bad guy is. This is a profound angle to take, but in the end... isn't grey usually used to represent dull? By taking this middle road Spielberg succeeds in giving the film a clear message, and he succeeds in avoiding much controversy. It is a universal film that speaks to everyone with a virtually unbiased view. But he fails in creating a truly compelling 3 hour piece of cinema.It is a long running time for a film that never allows you to become too emotionally involved with the proceedings. Even though we sympathize with Avram and some members of his team, Spielberg seems to be trying to minimize these emotional attachments. Avram's story is tragic true, but so is everyone's. While Spielberg's neutral approach seems to have emphasized and strengthened the power of his statement against violence, it weakens the film's cinematic strengths.Casting was top notch, with a solid ensemble led by a subtle and moving Bana. It is surprising that Bana didn't break through with any kind of critical notices or awards nominations... however, in a year of such great male performances I would certainly not call him robbed. The rest of the ensemble is solid and fully realized, however, aside from Avram there aren't any performances which offer us great insight into the feelings of these characters. This seems to be the choice of Spielberg, who obviously wanted the film to be as neutral as possible. Nevertheless performances are great.I also really loved the camera-work in the hit scenes. Every assassination attempt was paced brilliantly, evoking a great level of anxiety and frustration... just as they were supposed to. I also really appreciated the fact that Spielberg waited to show us what happened in the terrorist attack that started it all. By waiting to show the whole thing, and just revealing bits and pieces to the audience throughout... he managed to keep me questioning who was right and who was wrong the whole time.The answer... no one. And it's the same general opinion I have of MUNICH. Spielberg was neither right or wrong in making the film the way he did. I agree with his approach of remaining neutral, but can't help finding the film to be less gripping. And though the message is clearer due to Spielberg's position, it's impact is weakened as well.I respect it and am glad I saw it, but that's it.... B- ...",7,0,0,14 February 2006
Fantastic Four," FANTASTIC FOUR : Unspeakably Bad Film Based On Brilliant Source Material...
","FANTASTIC FOUR Now honestly, I knew I couldn't expect much when I rented this movie, but all I wanted was stupid entertainment. But this movie was so terrible and simple that it was confusing.This has to be one of the most god-awful screenplays that Hollywood has ever produced. Being completely honest... I could have written a better screenplay and directed a better film.The Fantastic Four as a comic-book has enormous cinematic potential because it takes a group of super-heroes who are reluctantly thrust into their roles as super-humans... however, their stories are even stronger b/c of the honest and deep family dynamic they hold as a team.Every piece of that is lost in this translation to film. In order to set up a good franchise, they should have taken the time to explore who these people are before and during their mission to space. Reed's mission isn't described to the audience as anything deeper than 'if we head into space and get a testing from a space cloud, we can help people live longer'. That's honestly the most detailed description of his mission.And the dynamic between Reed and Sue Storm is never actually apparent between the actors... there are only random moments of dialogue that spoon feed the audience the most elementary tension between them.Basicall the film is a giant waste of a source material that could have made a great film. It's filled with implausibilities and unexplained errors... for example: - Why could Reed's every-day, cotton shirts stretch to unbelievable lengths along with his body? However, in order for Jessica Alba to become invisible she must strip off her clothes... yeah, very subtle... hot chick gets naked...<ul><li>What was the point of The Thing (Michael Chiklis) saving the one suicidal man on the bridge? B/C in the process of doing so he destroys about 10 cars and probably kills numerous people on the highway.</li></ul><ul><li>How did The Thing manage to change himself back into his deformed self without anyone to push the button? - What was with all the BLATANT, BLATANT, BLATANT product placements? Pathetic.</li></ul><ul><li>If they were in quarantine, how did Chris Evans managed to take that awful actress from ACCESS Hollywood not only out of the building... but in a ****ing helicopter on a huge mountain? Aside from all of this, the performances are awful. The only actor who comes out slightly unscathed is Chris Evans as Johnny Storm/'Human Torch'... he obviously got to ad-lib some lines which gave him the best dialogue in the film. Jessica Alba is not only completely wrong for the role of Sue Storm (with a good screenplay this is the kind of role that should be played by Naomi Watts or Charlize Theron... she's supposed to be maternal and wise). Whoever played Mr. Fantastic should never work again. Micheal Chikless as The Thing offers one of the worst performances ever given while wearing such a ridiculous costume (The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were played better). And Julian McMahon as Dr. Doom wasn't scary for a single frame.</li></ul>I can't tell if it's all to blame on Tim Story, the director *cough cough. I can tell you this is about one of the least talented young directors working today... TAXI and FANTASTIC FOUR, greeeeat resume buddy.Honestly, I knew I couldn't expect much... but the universal awfulness of this movie was just ridiculous. Not once was it exciting, funny, or tense. It just wasted two hours of life. And it's extra disappointing b/c I can picture in my head how great of a film could have been made from the source material.Awww well... Hollywood blew a good opportunity and everyone involved made a fool of themselves doing so. Too bad.... F ...",1,35,65,5 March 2006
Sin City," SIN CITY : Fascinating Visuals, Great Ensemble, & Overall Cool...
","SIN CITY Is it possible for a movie to be great simply b/c of how f-ing cool it is...? The answer, for me at least, is yes. SIN CITY, directed by Robert Rodriguez & Frank Miller, is an adaptation of Frank Miller's classic Gothic comics. It tells three stories, chosen from a large list, all set in Basin City. Basin City is a rundown, crime-infested town where thugs, murderers, and whores are all fighting for their own right to survive... and it's a fascinating movie.A big deal was made about the visual style back when the film came out... and it damn well deserved the attention. The stylization Rodriguez uses here is stunning... it's a black and white tableau that utilizes splashes of vibrant color to emphasize different things. Whether the color is used to emphasize beauty (Goldie), evil (Yellow Bastard), or the simple elegance of a woman's red lips it is always stunning to behold. But what makes SIN CITY so stunning is the way it takes grime, evil, and violence and somehow makes it seem like an artistic mural.But SIN CITY has a lot more then stunning visuals going for it, it's also got some incredibly engrossing performances. The entire cast does what they are supposed to do... whether it means fully conveying a torn character of brute strength (like Mickey Rourke's Marv) or whether it simply means be hot as all hell (like Jessica Alba's Nancy). No actors here really dig into nuances, but it's not necessary in a film so purposefully extravagant. Instead, the actors seem to embrace the outer extravagances of their characters and build a character through that. It all makes for an incredibly stylized ensemble.What's also so refreshing about the movie is that, while it easily could have solely depended on it's style to make a good film, it opts not to. The three individual stories told are incredibly fascinating and exciting... and while they do act as three separate pieces, they are integrated together very smoothly into one package.It is truly a wonderfully directed film overall. Though Frank Miller got Co-Director billing and Quentin Tarantino was brought in as a Guest Director... I think most of the praise belongs to Rodriguez. He has managed to edit together a moving comic book. The voice-overs from the actors work perfectly with the visuals and the pacing. Instead of using camera tricks to mask a boring scene... he only enhances scenes that are already wonderful with his visual touch.It's hard to really pin-point what it is that makes a film like SIN CITY so damn good. It's the kind of movie that perhaps you should just sit back and soak up the 'coolness' for what it is. It's a popcorn flick without anything to say that will change the world... although it's visual styling re-defines what film can accomplish when it comes to visuals.If there was a deep message I was supposed to get out of SIN CITY for some reason it was lost on me... but I sure as hell enjoyed the film enough to watch it again and again to find out if there is one. And if I never find one, SIN CITY will still be one of the coolest and most artistically interesting films I've ever seen.... A ...",9,0,1,7 April 2006
The Pursuit of Happyness," THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS : Transcends The Dangerously Sappy Formula With Genuine Emotion...
","THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESSGoing into a film like THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, the audience can basically assume that in the end, that happ'y'ness will be found in the end... leading to a tear-jerking finale of overwhelming emotion. As one would expect, that's exactly how THE PURSUIT OF Happiness ends, but even though there is virtually no level of surprise, this Will Smith vehicle somehow manages to stand above similarly themed sap-fests.THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS tells the true story of Christopher Garndener (played by Will Smith in a very touching performance), a down-on-his luck salesman who finds himself raising his son on his own in the hardest of financial times. In an attempt to make life better for himself and his young son (played by Smith's real life son Jaden), Chris embarks on a demanding internship at the firm Dean & Whitter. It's an unpaid position with no promise of a job afterwords, but Gardener sees it as his only choice and despite being homeless and broke, he carries out the internship with determination to be the one man chosen for a job with the firm.The movie follows a very conventional format, but it does so in a refreshingly unconventional manner. Gabrielle Muccino, the film's director, embraces a grittier look for the film and wisely chooses to not emphasize the emotions at every possible moment. Too often a film like this seems to be gunning for tears from it's audience at every possible moment, but Muccino shows genuine restraint and instead lets the drama play out very naturally.Many times throughout the movie, it seemed impossible how difficult this poor mans life... and knowing that this actually happened to someone makes the film all the more powerful. Will Smith grounds the familiar story with a quiet, humble, and stoic determination to succeed that is only overshadowed by a love for his son. Smith conveys the conflicting feelings of love, failure, stress, and anger without ever losing the gentle hearted soul that makes Christopher Gardener. One of my largest reservations about the film was the casting of Smith's real-life son, however it turns out to be a very wise choice. Jaden Smith is so at ease acting opposite his father that he succeeds in avoiding the cloyingly annoying sweetness of most child actors. It's a very natural relationship between the two that works very well.THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS transcends it's conventionally inspirational story by taking many unconventional approaches as mentioned above. However, there are a few moments that stand out as slightly manipulative... in particular, a sequence in which Smith and his son spend a night in a subway pretending to hide from Dinosaurs. However, in a genre that is usually overflowing with sap, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS makes it through the majority of its 2 hour running time without overdoing it. For that, THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS exceeded my expectations, and Smith's performance is deserving of award-consideration at year's end.... B+ ...",7,2,3,9 January 2007
Hustle & Flow," HUSTLE & FLOW : Film-making Dynamite With The Searingly Good Terrence Howard...
","HUSTLE & FLOW HUSTLE & FLOW, featuring a blazing turn from the enthralling Terrence Howard, is an unexpectedly wrenching movie that moves along at a beat just as pulsating as the music genre it centers around.The movie wraps you around it's finger with it's opening 'calm before the storm' monologue where D-Jay (Howard) sits in his hot Chevy with Nola (Taryn Manning), his best prostitute, talking about the world. You can see this is a man doped up on some drugs while she is as well, but the artistic soul inside of him is clearly trying to push itself out of D-Jay in a way he can't yet grasp. And as soon as the audience sees the core reality and humanity of the character... the beat starts driving the film.When D-Jay starts to rap, Howard shows you that this isn't a passion slowly coming out of him... it is a tidal wave of frustration, passion, talent, and desperation pounding against a wall of drugs, depression, and disappointment that he has built up for years. Yet, even in his childlike excitement over the new prospects in his life, he can never break free of the lifestyle and situations that life as a pimp has put him in.This truly is a brilliant performance from Howard and he deserves the attention he has received from the Academy and other critics organizations. But it's also refreshing to know that this ensemble was recognized at SAG. It truly was some of the best ensemble work I've seen in a long time (faaaaaaar surpassing CRASH... which was an example of true ensemble work sure, but this is an example of true ensemble work on a superior level with the talent leaping off the screen). Taryn Manning was especially compelling in her role as D-Jay's 'cheif investor'. It's a shame no buzz developed around her for a Supporting Actress nomination.I've read some reviews cite this film as ridiculous... but to me, the life of a Pimp is in some ways 'ridiculous'. Despite the terrible living situations and rough lifestyle... their lives are filled with over-indulgence in all the wrong things. Sex, drugs, and music.However, this movie never looks down on the struggle and dream of D-Jay... partially because of brilliant pacing, and very much so because of Terrence Howards searing performance. HUSTLE & FLOW is a genuine surprise. Fully engrossing, heartbreakingly honest, entertainingly open-minded... everything to add up to greatness.I probably never would have rented it had I not felt required to b/c of it's Oscar nominations. But I am thrilled I did, b/c despite it's lack of 'important messages' and 'political topics'... HUSTLE & FLOW is one of the best films I've seen this year.Film-making dynamite....

V for Vendetta," V FOR VENDETTA : Interesting, But In The End It's All Too Much...
","V FOR VENDETTA I honestly had little clue what the film was about going into it. I knew a general idea of the controversial topics the film covers, but had no idea how they went about doing it. All I knew was that the movie looked stylish and was generating buzz... so I was happy to go. In the end, I walked away having never been bored... but also unsure as to whether I actually enjoyed the piece or not.V FOR VENDETTA is a very ambitious film. It takes on a topic much in the same way that MUNICH did (though I know the messages, themes, and histories of the pieces are completely incomparable... I'm not comparing them on anything besides the approach to their topics). Both are films this past year that attempted to present a neutral, unbiased view of terrorism and violence and the pros and cons it brings. For me though, this stance may be bold, but ultimately it does not service the films.V FOR VENDETTA is a confusing, constantly shifting film with a lot of glossy qualities. It took every ounce of my focus to keep up with what was going on... and the plot is constantly shifting. This made things remain interesting to me, however it was never a film that I could sit back and soak up. It tells the story of a 'freedom fighter' of sorts named V... and he terrorizes the country in order to take down Parliament. He believes that people should not fear their government... it should be the other way around. And through violence towards the governmental establishment, he aims to fix the problem.Meanwhile, a girl named Evie (played by Natalie Portman) gets mixed up in his game. Her parents died fighting for some of V's ideals, and Evie is torn between helping the nations leading terrorist and fighting for what she ultimately believes in.However, this summary of the plot is a shameful generalization. Their is so much more in the film than that basic outline. Everything the film does it does with beautiful stylization and confident direction. All the elements are there, but for an action movie like this things are ultimately a little too complicated.I feel like the film they were trying to make and the audience they were trying to reach was far less ambitious then the actual message they were trying to put into everything. For someone to go into this movie completely unaware of the twisting plot that lies ahead of them it all ends up being a bit overwhelming.I can't fault the movie b/c it is definitely well produced and features strong production elements on every side. The performances are also very solid if nothing remarkable. However, like I said, their was a little bit too much of a message and plot to fit into the movie they hyped this film up to be.Perhaps I need to watch it again so that I can be familiar with things and sit back and enjoy it more so then focus on following the difficult plot. But on first viewing, V FOR VENDETTA is an admirable, yet very flawed/overambitious effort.... C ...",6,0,2,31 March 2006
