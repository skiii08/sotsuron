Alien 3," Ripley strikes again!
","Alien³ is very good movie, Ripley is again involved with the Alien, but this time the Alien is inside her, oh no! The good point of this movie is the scenarios, the atmosphere is darkness, more to the predecessors, the storyline is very good too. While Alien shows the suspense and Aliens shows the action, Alien³ shows a bit of both. *** of 5 stars.",7,0,3,27 January 2000
Back to the Future Part III," The most humane of the trilogy
","Back To The Future III is a great end for the trilogy. BTTFIII is a most humane and dramatic film of the three ones too, exploring the relationship of the characters Marty, Doc and Clara Clayton, well as the performance of the actors. The old Hill Valley in 1885 is a perfect setting for all this. Thanks all cast and crew for this wonderful trilogy!!!!",7,0,0,9 November 1999
Back to the Future Part II," 'You gotta come back with me...-Where?...-Back to the future
","Back to the Future II is one of the cases where the sequel is equal or better than the original movie. The details and the series of paradoxes and deja'vu in this film are the key-point in this one. The fidelity of the storyline is amazing, despite a 4 years delay of this and the 1985's film. The only negative point is the absence in cast of Claudia Wells as Jennifer Parker and Crispin Glover as George McFly.",7,1,3,9 November 1999
Back to the Future," The best movie about time travel...any doubt?
","If there are explanations to like time travels, BTTF is one of them. Robert Zemeckis, Bob Gale and Steven Spielberg bring us with the best movie about time travel (any doubt?) of all time. The cast are very competent, specially Christopher Lloyd (Doc Brown) and Thomas F. Wilson (Biff Tannen),who make yours characters unforgettable!!!The story and plot are very intelligent ...the scene of Clock Tower is one of most memorable of the movies history!If you like time travel, no rent this movie...please...buy it!!",10,1,2,16 November 1999
