The Blair Witch Project," It blows (Spoiler)
","I saw it the day it opened, to minimize the effect of heightned expectations.  So my expectations were minimal.  It blew.  From the very beginning there is no attempt to get the audience to empathize with the characters.  They could not have been more unlikeable.  They were afraid of a pile of rocks?  Not likely.  As soon as that happened, I lost any ability to relate to the character's sense of fear.  Everything else that happened was random and unclear.  You could never quite grasp what exactly they thought they were running from.  Whatever sounds they heard, I certainly didn't hear. And when a character does dissappear, there sense of fear doesn't seem to increase. Interesting because I think that would be pretty scary. It was random, and nonsensical. I'm sorry if you think I am warped by Hollywood's idea of a scary movie. But there is nothing inherently scary about bad camera work and bad dialouge. The scariest thing about this movie is the thought that similar movies are likely to be massed produced due to the unfathomable box office success of this piece. Skip it.",2,0,1,25 October 1999
