It," One of the greatest horror movies, those who think otherwise can rot with Tim Curry
","This is a well made, absolutely terrifying film. Bill Skarsgard IS the best Pennywise. Those who think Tim Curry is the best can just go back to their VHS tape of that version, this one is superior. All kids are easy to relate to in one way or another, Pennywise is finally scary for once, and the entire film just makes your spine tingle in fear. It's not just a jump scare film, it's a deep, emotional, well thought film that earned Stephen Kings approval, who wrote the book of the same name! Must watch for all horror fans!",10,0,3,11 June 2018
Alien vs. Predator," Pretty good by my standards
","This is a pretty epic installment to both the alien and predator franchises, even for a PG-13. I don't understand why it was hated on. Some fans of Alien and Predator may complain because of lack of gore, but they did get away with Aliens getting their faces split in half or Predator head explosions. I think it would have fared better if it was and R-rated film, but then again, the sequel was R-rated and that one didn't do too well either. I dunno why people dislike it, Nostalgia Critic reviewed it saying 'It is overall worth watching.' And there are tons of worse movies getting 4-star reviews, so yeah, I blame the economy. At least try it, but I do warn you, It starts out a little slow.",8,1,2,7 June 2018
