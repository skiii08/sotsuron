The Blair Witch Project," Spmewhat scary as the tension builds
","In a forest near the village once called Blair there lived a witch, or so it was rumoured by the old folk. A young girl Heather decides to do a project on the subject and investigate the myth at close hand. Two guys Mike and Josh agree to join her and they set off in a car with backpacks and camping equipment, map, compass and all the necessary gear. It's going to be a load of fun out there in the forest...or so they thought.According to the prologue the film we see has been put together from film footage found in their discarded cameras.Admittedly the end product is a documentary with an original approach, but it does not prove or disprove anything.  The jerky camera work does provide clues that something is going on...voices in the night...little heaps of stones appearing outside the tent which were not there the night before (or were they?)... rocks in a strange nest of twigs perched in a tree...strange mobiles fashioned out of tree branches swinging in the breeze...and is somebody watching them as they wander further in to the forest? A witch....maybe?The scary atmosphere builds up after they lose their map and they decide to go south using only the compass. Cold, hungry...they seem to be going in circles...then Josh disappears into the blackness of the night!The film is more about human relationships as in their desperation they squabble amongst themselves.  Tension builds.  They are all at screaming point.  They are truly lost!The whole film plays on the imagination of the viewer.  If you are nervous and imaginative you are ready to accept the various perils that beset them. But all the dangers are suggested.  We don't see any witch.  There are no visible intruders.  It's all in the mind.When the writers ran out of ideas, they have Mike and Heather finding and exploring a broken down cottage. In a fit of hysteria their cameras are dropped and continue running until the batteries cut out.  This brings the film to a sudden and abrupt ending.But was there really a witch out there?  That, dear viewer, is for you to decide!",7,0,1,22 April 2002
The Legend of Bagger Vance," You don't have to be a golfer to enjoy this engrossing golf tournament
","All the disappointments, frustrations and exultations in the game of golf are carefully scripted into this story right up to the final hole. There is mild excitement between the top-notch photographic shots of the setting sun and the trees that line the well-groomed fairway, but there are really no surprises.  I was pretty sure that Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) would beat the world champions, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagan.  After all he could not let down his young somewhat precocious little friend Harley (Michael Moncrieff), the beautiful Adele Invergorden (Charlize Theron)in her sumptuous twenties outfits and the mystical Bagger Vance (Will Smith) who appears one night while Junuh is hitting golf balls into the darkness surrounding his house. Vance proves to be a minder. adviser, psychologist and coach while he carries the clubs around the course.  'You've lost your swing' he says with his critical smile. 'You must focus'.  There are close-ups of Kunuh's eyes peering forward  along the fairway at the distant green.  There is an amazing piece of photography where we actually travel with the ball from tee to hole.  On one occasion the ball lands among a clump of trees and there seems to be no way out. 'Focus!' he is told and focus he does and we travel upward with the ball and through a narrow opening in the treetops.  Even the name of Matt Damon could not draw large audiences to the film which had a short run at my local cinema.  It is not so much a story about golf as about a young man in a perilous state after atrocious World War 1 experiences who finds his real self and re-establishes himself with the people of Savannah his home town.",7,0,1,26 February 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Nightmarish expose of drug addiction
","A mother (Ellen Burstyn) and her son (Jared Leto) become addicted to drug-taking each in their own way. Mother wants to wear a pretty red dress that doesn't fit any more so she goes on a diet and an uncaring doctor gives her pills to take. The unemployed son is involved in drug trafficking as a means of support and when he feels he needs a lift a quick jab with a needle seems to do the trick.We watch the slow degeneration of the two characters as their addictions take hold. In a schizophrenic frenzy mother starts imagining she is on stage at the television station with the audience wildly enthusiastic about her presence in her lovely red dress and the son is developing an infection on his left arm at the site of the multiple injections.Mother and son love and care for each other in their unhealthy states, the son advising his mother that the pills she is taking are dangerous and addictive and that she should give them up. Mother believes the doctor knows best so she doubles up on her doses. Her mind then becomes very troubled indeed. The refrigerator (with the food in it) starts jumping towards her. Or so she believes. It's a frightening experience for her Parts of this film are not for the squeamish. Injections are bad enough but when the needle goes into the son's suppurating ulcer it's a disgusting sight and the electric shock treatment on mother's brain is terrible to watch. The two characters are obviously fading fast and are on a road which leads straight to hell.The photographic effects of mother's delirium as she imagines events from her past life and as a TV watcher projects herself into the limelight of notoriety are extremely well done. Also, when the son is at a low ebb and injects himself, we almost feel the sense of relief that he is feeling as we watch the fleeting images on the screen.The two main characters mentioned above hold the viewer throughout the film. The other characters also well played illustrate how so many others suffer in their association with their drug-addicted friends. There is a sense of hopelessness in the whole film despite the efforts of over-worked medical staff. Addiction is a much used word in the world today and the future looks grim.This is a truly professional film in every way. It presents a serious challenge and the message is clear..",8,1,2,28 December 2006
Catch Me If You Can," Cat & mouse situations maintain interest to the end
","I was fascinated by the very original introductory credits and some of the best graphics in years. It grabbed my immediate interest and augured well for what was to follow.The film itself is based on a series of serious criminal offences perpetrated by a young man called Frank Abagnale.  The eventual outcome of his years of crime is nothing short of miraculous...almost unbelievable were it not for the fact that the events actually happened.The dramatic theme is handled with a very light touch...even with a sense of comedy at times.  Leonardo Di Caprio excels as the anti-hero giving us quite an arresting performance.  His role suggests that if you wish to impersonate someone the donning of a uniform ensures you are half way there.It is interesting that Tom Hanks was happy to play a supporting role. Despite his capable interpretation of the CIA agent, it is Leonardo's part as the lying,cheating, fraudulent impostor that will be remembered.To some extent some of the situations are repetitive and the film may be a trifle long, but I have to admit that there is a surge of interest in the end with an unpredictable aftermath of his life of crime.",8,2,3,30 August 2004
United 93," An imaginative portrayal of a terrifying ordeal
","Four planes taken over by terrorists on that fateful day we call 9/11 struck terror in the hearts of the Amercan people. This film is an attempt to portray what happened on Flight 93. This was the fourth plane which happened to miss its target and made heroes of its passengers.I thought the casting was good. I didn't know any of the actors. They seemed like ordinary people caught up in a terrifying experience. What took place on that flight we will never know in absolute detail. We do know however that mobile phones were used by passengers to say a last farewell to wives and loved ones before the imminent crash landing.I found those final conversations very moving. What do you say when you know that death seems inevitable? That maybe you only have a few minutes left? The scripting of those conversations were probably the most accurate part of the story because families will never forget those final farewells.I think the scriptwriters did an excellent job in researching the events and portraying what they believed was the manner in which the drama unfolded. It seems entirely acceptable to me. Indeed as I watched the action I felt I was watching an actual record of the real event. When the terrorists lacking in experience took over the control of the aircraft the plane plunged and rolled tossing the occupants out of their seats. These scenes were well done. Considering that most of the camera work was carried out in the one set (the plane) there was never a moment of boredom. The suspense was hardly bearable.I liked too the subdued musical sound effects, the percussion instruments giving the impression of impending danger. This really did heighten the drama.Overall a very good production, one I will remember for a very long time",8,4,6,14 October 2006
Erin Brockovich," An entertaining film about a remarkable woman
","'This film is based on a true story'. So goes the prologue to the film version of the life of Erin Brokovich.  The word 'based' gives the writer a great degree of latitude and it is probably the imaginative embellishments that add so much to the entertainment value of these remarkable events.The theme of the little guys up against the billion dollar companies is not new, but following the story gives one a feeling of tremendous satisfaction when honesty and perseverance wins through.  Such is the case with Erin Brokovich.  What a woman!  As portrayed in this film Erin Brokovich ( Julia Roberts) has a great figure amply displayed to the other employees and clients and commonly referred to as her secret weapon.  Julia Roberts gives a whirlwind performance as a single mother punctuating every outburst with repeated expletives.I do doubt the probability of a mother with three very young children allowing a biker with a Harley Davidson to watch over her children during her working day.  And what private  or government authority would allow a stranger to spend hours looking through confidential documents  held in their filing system.  But it makes a great story and the odd characters that pop up in various parts of the film give little gem performances.Serious aspects of the film involve a court case about compensation for the horrible deaths of people exposed to contaminated water in their daily lives.  We get a chemistry lesson too about the various forms of chromium and their relative biological toxicities.But when the film is over and the credits roll it's Julia Roberts as the central character we remember. A truly great performance.",8,0,1,7 January 2002
Shakespeare in Love," Judi Dench outshines all!
","If you want to admire real acting then watch Judi Dench's performance as Queen Elizabeth. Her appearances are brief but immediately we feel we are in the presence of a royal personage. A toss of the head, a withering glance and some cutting remarks immediately establish her character.  We hang on her every word, every movement.  I found the character of young Will Shakespeare lacking in a certain warmth.  After all,Shakespeare was a man who could write on every aspect of human nature.  I thought the bustling crowd scenes were well executed down to the last detail and the Rose and Curtain theatres had just the right atmosphere.  The dialogue infused with Shakespeare's words from his famous plays was clever script-writing and should appeal to a wide audience.  But on the whole, despite some good individual performances, I expected more from an Academy Award winner for best film.  It must have been a nightmare for the director handling those energetic crowd scenes which he did so well. But perhaps he should have spent more time on Joseph's interpretation of young Will Shakespeare.",8,0,1,25 October 1999
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A colourful, noisy,rumbustious adventure.
","Without a doubt this is Johnny Depp's film. As Captain Jack Sparrow he shows once again what a versatile actor he is. He bursts forth on the screen as a wily pirate character full of tricks such as distracting his adversaries with non-stop chatter.His swaggering walk unsteadied by a little too much rum and his flippant manner endear him to us immediately.  He seems to fear no man, and despite his unkempt appearance has a way with the women too.Johnny Depp has a mammoth task.  He is on the screen most of the time.  The success of the film largely depends on his performance.  Never once does he shirk this responsibility.  Indeed he seems to enjoy every minute.The battles at sea with cannonballs flying through the air bringing down masts and rigging and gouging great holes in the decks are a triumph of set design.  Wooden ships are very inflammable and lend themselves to some dramatic moments with everything aflame amid noise and confusion.  There is almost too much to watch at one sitting.  It is just as well because the story is pretty thin.The film especiaslly in the sword-fighting episodes is reminiscent of some of the early serials that once excited us at the Saturday afternoon flicks. Despite clash of steel on steel not much blood is apparent among the roguish-looking pirates who all look as if they need a hot bath. The make-up is right on target, a real credit to the artists.Much of the time Geoffrey Rush as Barbossa has to act with a monkey sitting on his shoulder.  An excellent little touch I thought as it added to his nasty character.  I could not take my eyes off the monkey.  He stole every scene for me.If we may judge from the almost endless listing of credits, a lot of work was put into this production.  It's loud and noisy and lots of fun and will be especially appreciated by those who grew up on pirate stories, and as in all those stories it's the good that triumphs over evil in the end.",7,0,1,10 May 2004
Billy Elliot," An inspiring climb to fame against all odds
","Persistence wins through for young Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) when he auditions for entry into the Royal Ballet School.  Throughout his young life Billy is spurned by his father who physically abuses him, declaring that 'boys do boxing....sport....wrestling....not f****** ballet.'  But dancing is in Billy's veins.  Encouraged by his local chain-smoking ballet teacher (Julie Walters) he gradually gains the necessary confidence at his weekly ballet classes.The film gives you a nice warm feeling as Billy in his triumphant moments dances in the streets in sheer joy.  There are some splendid contrasts in the film as it cuts from angry-faced striking coal miners to gentle ballet classes and soft fluffy tutus.The music and dancing lifts the rather depressing atmosphere of this north England mining town where workers are losing their jobs, but it is by no means a 'musical'.The final scene of 'Swan Lake' fills you with pride and satisfaction.I found only one drawback to the film.  I was not able to comprehend a lot of the dialogue.  I would like to have had the movie sub-titled.If you have ever experienced an audition and performed in front of a selection committee, you will appreciate the feelings of a young boy striving to attain the seemingly impossible.  His earnest persistence unites the members of his family.An inspiring film, well worth watching for the sheer joy of it.",8,0,0,25 March 2002
Alexander," Admirable attempt at capturing a turning point in history
","After a lot of unnecessary disparaging remarks about the portrayal of a bisexual hero which I quickly discarded, I was able to concentrate on some of the outstanding qualities of this epic tale.Firstly I admired the sweeping vistas of the lands that Alexander (Colin Farrell) conquered and enslaved. All credit to the set designers and the magic wrought by computerization. There was so much to watch in these crowd scenes.so many soldiers.so much action.Secondly there were the costumes for men and women, warriors and soldiers, rich and poor and royal families of different lands. So much research was required here. After all 356 BC was a long time ago. If you are going for authenticity, you must not let the imagination roam too far. I thought the overall effect of the costume design was fantastic. Congratulations to those responsible. You did your job well.Thirdly, the battle scenes were understandably chaotic. How else could you record hand to hand fighting? There were some graphic shots I will always remember. I am not sure why but the forest of spears in vertical position prior to the attack was a wonderful piece of cinema that sent shivers down my back. Also the elephants in India lunging forward through the tropical undergrowth like an unstoppable army was an inspiring sight.Oliver Stone as the creator of this mammoth project must have dreamed for many years about the portrayal of Alexander. I imagine that he had many sleepless nights. The result which hit the movie screens around the world is a digest of Alexander's unique life. It shows us that Alexander was so much more than a soldier. He was also a man who had his fears too...was prone to explode in a violent temper... and again break down and cry when things went bad.Colin Farrell in the title role had a gigantic task ( and did well) as the teenager who led an army (Can you imagine such an event today?) and went on to conquer the kingdoms of North Africa, Asia Minor and Persia. He made a striking figure on his favorite horse as he urged his men ever onward when all they really wanted was to go home to their wives and children. His eventual death at 33 still remains a mystery but wine spiked with arsenic is a likely cause. Alexander's mother with whom he quarreled frequently insisted he was the son of Zeus. While many mothers adore their sons even Alexander thought that this was going a bit too far.The main criticism I have is that old Ptolemy prattles on a bit too much in the beginning of the film. We are not all students of classical literature and it is a bit upsetting to have all these classical names thrust at us. But eventually we become engrossed in Alexander's antics so what goes before hardly matters. Just let this great epic flow over you and ask yourself has the world really changed that much!",7,1,2,11 February 2007
The Mummy," Not my cup of tea!
","To be honest, this film is not my cup of tea, but I recognize that it does have some excellent features. Brendan Foster and Rachel Weisz make a great partnership and go a long way in setting the pace and maintaining it at top speed.Also, they somehow or other are able to link together a whole series of scenes composed of farcical nonsense.  And in the labyrinth of passageways where the scenes take place I find myself at a complete loss in understanding just where they are inside the pyramid.  But that does not matter.  There are far more exciting and terrifying things to worry about e.g. the bloodless mummies resurrected and in a fit of rage attack our heroes with wild abandon and the scarab beetles that can enter beneath the skin and burrow around the human body. There is danger at every corner.  The special effects are so well done.  Swords flash in every direction and legs,arms and heads of the mummies are sent flying from their scare-crow figures.  Our hero and heroine escape death by a split second time and time again like the characters in the Saturday afternoon serials. Anything can be done to excess and I feel the fight with the mummies is rather long and a trifle repetitive.  I wonder sometimes if special effects are ousting the actors in cinema today.  This is a mammoth production.  It must have cost a fortune to make. The most exciting episodes for me are the escapes through the corridors with the counterbalanced blocks of stone closing the escape routes. I admire the charismatic Brendan Fraser (so good in George of the Jungle). He handles these crazy parts so well. His co-star Rachel Weisz plays an archeological librarian who unbelievably does translations of Egytian hieroglyphs while on the run. What a gal! In a word, this film is a mad mixture of movie magic.  Kids will love it to the end.",7,3,4,17 January 2001
Silent Hill," Failed to impress
","I'm not one for playing video games so cannot comment on the adaptation.It's probably one of the most boring films I've had the misfortune to watch. Any marks I give for the production are for the set, not the script nor the acting.To maintain interest the storyline needs more than a couple of scared women wandering about a deserted and shadowy premises pointing a torchlight on anything that moves or is likely to move.The husband seems superfluous but is introduced to provide relief from the two women who continue to wander aimlessly on. Now we have two parties and still little is happening.The only scary bit for me was when the floor fell away and i thought the good lady was done for. But no! She was very athletic and managed to balance on a protruding floorboard and then jump to safety.There was no real tension as there should have been. May be the actors did the best they could with a bad script. Perhaps the director should have tightened up the proceedings. If you're going for a dreamlike atmosphere, care must be taken that it does not drag out the action.The idea of a building being built around a fire shooting up from the bowels of the earth did heat up the action for a while, but it seemed too much for the lady who started to spew up an enormous quantity of writhing worms or slugs.It's the only DVD I've activated the fast forward button to see if the ending was more exciting. I need not have bothered.",4,1,2,15 April 2007
Crash," A jigsaw of scenes that created a disappointing picture
","The film starts with a car crash and ends with a car crash and sandwiched in between is a mish-mash of scenes that I found difficult to follow.The film is well cast and the music is great. It would have been a great improvement to have had the option of English sub-titles. Because there was so much Afro-American dialogue, I could not easily decipher most of it except for the expletives of which there was plenty.It's a very unpleasant film with scarcely one happy character. If this truly represents a slice of American life, I am sorry to say the USA has a doubtful future.Some of the individual scenes are very well done, I liked the argument which ensued when the locksmith changed the lock but was unwilling to fix the door. It was a very exciting moment when the little girl jumped into her daddy's arms just as the gun was fired. And evidently a policeman does not like to be laughed at. He can become very touchy indeed with dire consequences. Despite some good scenes the whole was disappointing.We know there is racism in America. We don't need a film like this with its sledge hammer approach to remind us. I don't think this film has accomplished anything. It's a pity because the actors are so competent.Let us hope for something a little more optimistic next time..something a little more positive in its outlook...or we'll all end up taking anti-depression pills.",6,2,5,16 February 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Makes you think, especially about meat pies!
","Dark shadowy streets and poorly-lit rooms introduce us to a gloomy Dickensian atmosphere which is maintained through most of the film. Sweeney Todd (Johnny Depp) is not a cheerful fellow. How could he be? Judge Turpin who once condemned him to prison has stolen his wife Lucy and their little daughter Johanna.Mrs.Lovett(Helena Bonham Carter)who sells meat pies is one of his few friends. She has a spare room above her shop which she says would make a good barber shop. Some say Sweeney is the best barber in London. He probably is. Certainly better than Pirelli (Sacha Baron Cohen). So Sweeney sets up shop which meets with Mrs.Lovett's approval.This horror musical is a story of revenge as Sweeney sets his sights on the Judge luring him to his barber's chair where a quick shave promises an opportunity to slit his throat. Mrs.Lovett enters unannounced and the opportunity is lost. Sweeney's fit of uncontrollable rage makes him more determined than ever as he plunges into despair on the point of madness.Art decoration and costumes are award winners for this film as are the principal players for their perfect characterizations. Most of the dialogue is sung in this Sondheim musical. Half sung half spoken and with a Cockney accent is a triumph for the actors. 'My friends' has a sinister appeal as Sweeney gloats over his shiny cut-throat razors; 'Johanna' his daughter is captive in the Judge's house. 'While I'm around' is one of my favourites.At the depth of his madness Sweeney makes alterations to his barber's chair so that he can tip it backwards after murdering his victims. The bodies are directed to the basement where the human flesh can be put through a mincer and the bones discarded into the blazing furnace. The pie shop flourishes with its popular meaty pies. Mrs.Lovettsays it's a shame to waste the meat, it being quite expensive and hard to come by.Some people might not appreciate the bloody mess as Sweeney hacks at the jugular veins of his victims. It is not a pretty sight. However I find the basement scene where the human mince disgorges from the mincer even more horrifying. Add to this the complaints from residents of the awful smells issuing from the premises and we get a fair picture of the situation.There is some relief from the dreary atmosphere when Mrs.Lovett dreams of a day by the seaside. The screen is suddenly filled with sunshine and joyous colours so different from the world in which she lives.This is a splendid production, well put together with every detail attended to. Some might argue that in certain scenes there is too much detail. But there can be no argument that the Sondheim musical has been transferred from the stage to the screen in the most admirable fashion.",8,0,0,10 January 2009
Barry Lyndon," Brilliant and inspired cinema
","Considered one of Thackeray's best novels 'Barry Lyndon' comes to light in a brilliant fashion under the direction of Stanley Kubrik with Ryan O'Neal in the title role.A young Irish profligate of the 18th Century finds himself involved in the Seven Year's War in Europe. A born opportunist he deserts as a soldier and by all foul means seeks to improve his status by marrying a countess. He is now one of the new aristocracy...Mr. Barry Lyndon!The film version of Barry Lyndon's adventures as a cheat, as a spy, as a gentleman of the realm is absolutely flawless.  I have only high praise for the uniform quality as we go from scene to scene. The lighting in particular is striking, much like a classical painting. The photography is excellent....sweeping vistas of the European countryside with red-coated soldiers drawn up in battle lines and dropping in disarray under enemy fire....indoor scenes of elegance with people feasting or playing at cards, all bathed in soft candlelight Every scene is backed by well-chosen music gleaned from the classics. The choice is so good one might think it was written for the film. The art director too can be proud of the meticulous costumes, wigs and make-up; and the aging of the characters is well done and acceptable.There is also a lovely array of characters both old and young with interesting faces like those you would see in an old Rembrandt. As a character I especially like the old count who suffers terribly from an argument with the new Mr. Lyndon.  Another memorable scene is the outburst of the Countess's son who refuses to accept his step-father and endures a thorough thrashing.  There are poignant scenes too when Barry's little son comes to grief....and these are the days too when differences are solved by pistol or sword.All in all a well rounded film.  I find it much more satisfying than 'Russian Ark' which is praised so highly.  This film is filled with beauty and adventure and proves once again that 'what goes up must come down'....and so we have the rise and fall of Barry Lyndon!",8,12,19,2 August 2004
Full Metal Jacket," Worth watching
","'Their's is not to reason why. Their's is but to do and die'Lord Tennyson sums up the spirit of this film so well...a film which is divided into two parts with each part being rather better than the whole. The first part concerns the transformation of raw recruits into marines, a process of dehumanisation into killing machines.  In the second half we see a group of fully-fledged marines in action in Vietnam calling for tank support as they watch a couple of their buddies ripped apart by sniper fire.The build up of hatred for the drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermy) is the main feature of the first half with a very dramatic and tragic ending. Extremely well done.  As for the second half, good though it is, I never felt that what I was watching was actually in Vietnam. Never the less the sniper scene is exciting and tense. And what a surprise when the identity of the sniper is revealed.Like most war films the message that comes across stresses the futility of war and the dehumanisation of man on his mad path of destruction.It's a film worth watching if only to remind us that war solves few if any problems.",7,1,2,5 July 2004
American Pie," Guaranteed to revive memories for male audiences.
","A light-hearted romp among a group of American High School students who make a pact to get laid within the next three weeks.  Despite their bravado the boys are naive and inexperienced in matters of sexual behaviour.  This makes for some hilarious situations in their first approach to the opposite sex. Taken in the spirit of fun, the risque bedroom scenes are acceptable in context though some might find them rather offensive.  The teenage boys are so infatuated with salacious sex one wonders if their brains have relocated between their legs,  It's a real situational farce with characters being caught in compromising positions.  For me there were quite a few memorable scenes. For example: the father/son discussion about women's bodies as illustrated in the centre folds; the girl who discards her clothing in a bedroom which has been set up with a computer and digital camera and the whole stripping and masturbation sequence broadcast on the internet; the wolf whistles from the students next morning; the young guy giving a girl a taste of foreplay while he considers his next move in consultation with an illustrated sex folder; an irrestible urge to masturbate in a hole in his favourite fruit pie baked by his mother.... It goes on and on through a series of sexual activities that are accomplished with such naivete and awkwardness, it can't help but raise a few chuckles.  The scriptwriter has cleverly captured some of the frustrations of growing up in the turbulent teenage years.  The film goes at a good pace as the scenes bubble along one sfter another and the film is about the right length too.  Any longer, it would tend to become repetitive.  The singing group adds variety to the film and the background music used to accent the comedy in some of the scenes is a brilliant and original idea.",7,0,1,24 March 2001
The Killing Fields," One wonders how anyone survived the devastation of Cambodia
","Filmed in Thailand and Canada, this epic film portrays the devastating effect on the land and its people when the Khmer Rouge plundered from the north. slaughtered and enslaved the population of Cambodia. The Kmer Rouge soldiers proclaim that this is year zero in the new order. Past years must be forgotten.Not having been to Cambodia, I can only say that the bomb-blasted area of Phenomh Pen looked pretty authentic to me. It was a massive job for the director to control so many actors spread over enormous sets. Crowd scenes must be difficult to handle and there were many. Lots of shouting and yelling and shooting maintained a lively pace and huge explosions added to the general confusion of the war scenes.The character Pran (a translator) had a sympathetic role almost sacrificing his life for the American journalist Sydney Scharnberg.This is a film to be appreciated or admired rather than enjoyed. There are so many harrowing scenes in it that one begins to accept death as the norm, Many Cambodians must have felt the same way doubting that there could be any future after the carnage. Yet somehow over all there is a message of hope and a plan for peace. John Lennon seems to sum it up so well in his song 'Imagine'.By the way, I wonder how much Coca Cola paid to feature one of its delivery vans in a couple of scenes.",8,2,4,29 August 2005
Cast Away," Dramatic moments beyond my wildest expectations
","Most of us, I think, knew the general outline of the plot before reaching the theatre.  However, the plane crash early in the film was drama beyond my wildest expectations.  This incident from the initial warnings to the actual plunge into the Pacific was one of my most horrifying cinematic experiences. I literally went down with that plane.  The 'Robinson Crusoe'-like scenes which followed were interesting to a point although I thought Chuck (Tom Hanks) was rather slow in discovering a method of catching water from the torrential rains.  While it was necessary for the scriptwriter to introduce dialogue, I found some of the conversations between Chuck and the face on the ball rather silly and even a bit embarrassing, but I came to accept them in the knowledge that Chuck was on the point of madness anyway after years of isolation.  A great piece of cinema followed when the ocean liner sped past an almost dying man face down on his broken raft.  I was so anxious... Would the officers on the bridge see him or not?  The final homecoming was so touching, so moving and with such unexpected consequences.  Yes.. this is the story of a man who through 4 years of loneliness holds a dream close to his heart.  Fate plays strange tricks and when the outcome is analysed no-one is really to blame.",8,0,0,11 February 2001
Edward Scissorhands," It's a simple story, simply told
","In the weird-looking house at the top of the hill an almost perfect man is created on a strange-looking assembly line.  Unfortunately, before his hands can be attached, the mastermind collapses and dies.  It is the Avon lady on one of her calls who finds pale-faced Edward.  That's what she calls him.....Edward Scissorhands because he has scissors instead of hands and fingers,It's a great little fairy tale acted out with so much sincerity and good humour you could be forgiven if you believed it actually happened.The simple sets are cleverly painted in primary colours that give you the feeling you are looking at a child's picture book of fairy tales, everything is so neat, so clear-cut, so uncomplicated.I don't think Edward has any blood in him which accounts for his pale face. No wonder then that the Avon uses him as a model to experiment with her large range of cosmetics.What a transformation!  What a nice advertisement for Avon!Edward (Johnny Depp) with his dead pan expression is an expert with scissors.....chopping salads, cutting hedges, trimming dogs, and hairstyling the ladies of the neighbourhood.  Much is made of this in the film.    The humour constantly relates to his sharp bladed fingers. Oh what a danger it is to put him on a waterbed!People are not always kind to 'freaks'.  Edward is displayed on a TV show and people gawk at him, point at him, laugh at him.  Some play on his innocence to do unlawful acts.  We feel great empathy for poor dear Edward.

","Smart direction and great editing keeps this story going at a frantic pace. Ashton Kutcher in the role of Evan Treborn is on screen most of the time and must be given due credit for the success of this film. It has an intriguing opening and some scary exciting episodes along the way.Shakespeare said 'What's done is done and cannot be undone'. I'm inclined to agree. The theme so often used in going back in time to change the present and the future has never appealed to me. It doesn't make sense despite the fact that deep down we would all like to make such changes.However I have to say that the flashbacks are handled exceedingly well in this film. Evan seems to experience a painful seizure from time to time and the photographic portrayal of these moments is exceptional with quivering and floating images. The sound effects too add to the intense drama.This is a very busy film and I will need to watch it again to enjoy the full impact of a complicated story about past imagined events and reality. The psychiatrist has a tough job in sorting out Evan's problems and I too find it difficult to follow the fast tempo of the action.Some of the strong scenes not easy to forget are the Robin Hood movie in the basement cellar, the dog tied up in the bag, the dynamite in the postbox and the risquÃ© prison scene.This is a good production. Recommended viewing on DVD. I'd like to see more films starring Ashton Kutcher.",8,0,1,11 October 2006
Liar Liar," I didn't know that lunacy could be so entertaining
","An extrovert performance by the inimitable Jim Carrie gets the message across that telling lies is the way of the world.  Every body does it and for various reasons. The consequences can be painful both to self and family.A young five year old boy blows out the candles on his birthday cake and makes a wish that his Dad who never keeps his promises will not tell a lie for a whole day.  Well the wish comes true and we quickly discover that not eveyone is willing to accept the truth.There are some amazing scenes in a court room when Jim Carrie in true form stutters and stammers and contorts his body in the most ridiculous manner. He is a regular clown and certainly an expert in the art of mime.  He has the amazing ability of being able to project his feelings and emotions to his audience,Most of the other characters watch with open mouth his rapid succession of antics. I think 'gob-smacked' is the word.  He batters himself almost to bits by bashing his head on the walls of a washroom. 'What are you doing?' asks a surprised onlooker. 'I'm kicking myself in the arse' he says in frustration.A touch of sentimentality between father and son clearly shows that Jim Carrie who always has the audience in his grip can change the mood in the twinkling of ane eye.  He is the master of his craft.A film to be enjoyed with the kids.",7,0,0,21 June 2004
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Particularly interesting for martial arts enthusiasts
","This film with a somewhat threatening title turns out to be a work of art something like a Chinese scroll but with bolder richer colours and the accompanying music keeps respectfully in the background.The martial arts in this film are presented in a ballet style, the combatants defying all gravitational laws as the blades of steel thrash the air and strike with showers of sparks.  Interesting to watch for a while but for me the fights go on for too long.I could not believe my eyes when I watched the chase across the rooftops. What graceful leaps from house to house, floating airborne figures, the pursuer never overtaking, just as it happens in a dream.  Indeed, much of this film has a dreamlike quality.The most memorable moment was the sword fight in the forest of giant bamboos.  Flexing right and left, up and down, the branches move with body weight.  I have never seen anything so excitingly beautiful as the combatants appear and disappear amongst the dense growth of the green bamboos.While the story is mainly about a stolen sword and its repossession, it really is a fairy tale in which a lover can jump off a mountain top to make a wish come true.  There are wicked poisons and potions too.  What is most surprising though is that despite the furious wielding and thrusting of blades, most characters escape serious injury.  Being able to run up vertical walls helps a lot, I suppose.",8,0,0,22 June 2003
The Number 23," Something different for Jim Carrey & something original for movie goers
","This film is worth seeing both for its original theme and for the stunning dramatic performance of Jim Carrey. It's a psychological thriller about obsessive behaviour that can drive a victim to madness.Numbers are a part of our every day lives whether we are concerned with distance, time. prices or a day at the races. A number on a baker's van could foretell the winner of the steeplechase. All you have to do is convince yourself that numbers are more than just numbers; they have a special message or a special meaning.In this movie the number 23 is all important, and a rare book published on the subject has 22 chapters which Walter Sparrow (Jim Carrey) lives by. The interpretation of the numerological arguments gets him into a lot of trouble including some wild and dangerous nightmares.It is completely fascinating that important dates of world events when separated into single digits can add up to 23; not just one or two events but very many. You are more than half convinced there is something in it. But while you are thinking about it Walter comes to some serious conclusions and makes accusations that will change not only his life but the lives of others.For something original and different, this film fits the bill. I loved the epilogue.....a quote from the Holy Bible. And would you believe it, verse 23?",7,1,2,13 January 2008
Velvet Goldmine," Not great but worth a star or two!
","The old saying 'Wine, women and song' translates to 'Drugs,sex and rock' in the 60's to 70's and in 'Velvet Goldmine' we get it full on! Those who like the music of the era get it almost non-stop and those that like the gay recklessness also get a great helping. None of the colours are subtle in this film. The art director had a ball when he designed these sets and costumes! They're great! Congratulations all round. As for the gay guys, well...that's a part of the story, thin though it may be.  It's about a young vocalist Brian Slade trying for the heights of pop stardom. Apparently, any move you care to make is permissible when you're striving for top-rating. He emulates the current popstars and encourages friendships and business liaisons with those who matter.  Ewan McGregor fans will not be disappointed in his 'bare all' stage performance as the drug ridden Curt Wild and his fall from grace. But it is Brian Slade's story and as played by Johnathon Rhys-Meyer we get a sincere and energetic performance.  Some of the flashbacks do get a bit confusing as we jump from decade to decade, but does it really matter? We watch a journalist doing the back streets researching the lives and whereabouts of once great stars.  The film starts quietly with a beautiful starry sky.  Suddenly a star falls.  This unspoken prologue anticipates events which are to follow.",7,2,4,23 June 2000
Moulin Rouge!," A dazzling melodrama
","This film sets your head spinning with its noisy opening, its brilliant colours which burst like rockets on to the screen and the masterful camera work which lifts you up over the roof tops of Paris and propels you through the doors of the celebrated Moulin Rouge.  It is like nothing you have seen before.  A truly new cinematic experience.  Amongst all the fanciful Mont Martre characters - almost grotesque at times- runs a simple love story of Satine, the top star of the Moulin Rouge who is torn between wealth and security offered by a duke and the promise of love by a penniless writer of poetry.  What surprises me most is the comedy.  Somehow I did not expect it. An hilarious scene (there were many) was the secret meeting of Satine, the prostitute (Nicole Kidman) with Christian the poet (Ewan McGregor). She thought he wanted sex when he was simply determined to read her one of his poems.  The clever mingling of well-known songs (quite out of the period of 1900) linked the scenes with amazing effect.   At one moment it was the Sound of Music, at another a suggestion of Gilbert and Sullivan- a mad mixture of songs, but it worked and oh so well. I found myself enjoying every moment of this intricate weaving of songs. This film has all the elements of a great production.  It will never cease to amaze me how Baz Lurhmann could assemble such a wild lot of characters and bring them together in such a frenzy of sheer entertainment.  By the way, don't forget to take your handkerchief.",9,0,1,24 June 2001
Meet Joe Black," Lots of eye-gazing!
","If you overlook the impossible plot and sit back and enjoy the screen presence of Anthony Hopkins and boyish good looks of Brad Pitt, 'Meet Joe Black' is entertaining enough though at 180 minutes it's rather too long. The early coffee-shop scene which introduces the Joe Black character is most enjoyable and the parting of the 'lovers' with backward glances is a charming interlude in the story. Then comes the traffic fatality- a sudden jolt and so unexpected. There is a lot of eye-gazing in the next two hours and very little audible conversation. There is a lot of speaking in whispers! I thought the final birthday celebrations were much overdone even for a very wealthy family, but at least the spectacular fireworks could be heard. If you watch the closing scene carefully, you will note that although the sky is filled with brilliant light from the multitude of bursting rockets, the dark figures of of Pitt and Hopkins who are walking up the stone steps of the garden are not illuminated by flashes of colour from the sky. This is a bad oversight. One expects better.",7,0,0,30 August 1999
8 Mile," Not for me!
","This is not my kind of film. Rap is all rhythm. If you like the beat well and good. If you're looking for a happy tune you won't find it in hip-hop. It seems to me it's a new way of making cutting remarks or nasty insinuations. Eminen as Rabbit Smith does it very well. His character is maintained as an unsmiling teenager throughout the film, unhappy, unpleasant , poker-faced and ashamed to be still living with his mother. Very protective of his little sister we see another side of his character if only for a few minutes. This is the only heart warming scene in the whole film.The supporting characters are all good as they prowl the city streets in cars. Apart from the 45 second hip-hop contests there is not much to the story. Rabbit's mum has a sexy admirer but the partnership breaks up over a noisy argument. This adds a bit of life and action to an otherwise fairly boring film. Rabbit gets a job working the big metal presses which turn out parts for the assembly of automobiles. Rabbit relieves the boredom of this repetitive work with a little sexual workout in a quiet corner of the factory.This film should appeal to the younger set who are happy to listen to hip-hop and get a laugh from the suggestive lyrics. but don't expect a lot of drama. One thing I learned...if you're tucking a revolver back into your belt make sure you have your finger off the trigger.",6,0,0,2 October 2006
2001: A Space Odyssey," A somewhat disappointing prophecy about things to come
","There are some imaginative ideas in this film but with the passage of time since it was made the element of surprise and amazing feats described are now every day occurrences.  Space craft landing on distant planets....computers that are voice-activated.  Astronauts are now the new explorers....the great adventurers reaching out into the dangerous unknown spaces.  We read about them every day in the newspapers and we see them floating around in their weightlessness on our TV screens.This film is not a documentary nor a drama (there are far more exciting films) but rather a man's artistic interpretation of what might be in his future.  The film is divided into segments beginning with the dawn of man. The episodes which follow are only mildly linked with what has gone before. The most obvious perhaps is the tossing of an ancient thighbone into the air and in the next episode we see a spaceship which somewhat resembles the shape of that thighbone. Some of the other linkages must be left to the imagination.In one sequence we get the impression of the spaceship (isn't it huge?)hurtling through space by the use of colours streaming from a central point giving quite a good 3D effect. But since this film was made the computer graphics have advanced to such a degree that everything in the past pales into insignificance.I cannot imagine how such a mighty spacecraft could be launched.  Nor is there any attempt to suggest how this was possible.  I presume it was built in space beyond the earth's atmosphere.  As I said this is an art film not a how-to-do-it documentary.I was disappointed with the salon that the astronaut enters when he reaches Jupiter.  The furnishings look so familiar with tables and chairs, wine glasses and knives and forks.  I never imagined that the beings on Jupiter looked like us nor had the same life style.As for the mysterious black monolith that pops up from time to time, every one is forced to use his own imagination as to what purpose it serves. I do not know.  I can only surmise that it has some kind of regenerative power which creates beings for the next step in man's development.  A sort of super cloning device.  Imaginative, yes.  This assumes of course that we are on the right path to the summit of excellence.The most exciting moment in the film is the argument between the astronaut and the computer when the computer informs him that something has gone wrong and danger lies ahead. The close-ups of the astronaut's intense expression are well done.  Most of the other characters are not developed to any extent and consequently less interesting.In my opinion...interesting, but not Kubrik's best work.",8,2,5,21 June 2004
There's Something About Mary," Enjoyable comedy that really sparkles!
","The movie starts with a song and ends with a song, and in-between, the song links the principal scenes.  The film never falters with its great script, fast pace and excellent acting.  Cameron Diaz really sparkles as the much sought-after Mary and Ben Stiller gives an amazing performance as the shy Ted.  Matt Dillon plays the lying eaves-dropping investigator with all stops out! As a result, it turns out to be one of the best comedies of the year. A couple of scenes are very risque, but manage to keep just within the bounds of censorship.  It's about a love-sick guy who seeks out a girl he knew 13 years before.  She's moved to Florida so he has to engage a private investigator to seek out and stalk her.  It so happens that the stalker falls for Mary, too.  Two of the funniest scenes involve a family dog.  In one scene the dog which has been over-dosed with a soporific drug has to be hurriedly resuscitated (a really farcical scene) and later, poor Ted is savagely attacked by the dog as it goes for his throat and other extremities.  These are only two of the extremely funny situations which keep the laughter bursting forth.  Ted is one of those unfortunate guys who always seem to be in trouble through no fault of their own,  Whether the girl of his dreams chooses him in the end from amongst her various admirers cannot be divulged here.  It can only be said that finally sincerity wins the day.",8,0,0,27 March 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Kubrick masterpiece
","As relevant today as when the film was made 30 years ago, Kubrick's film has become a classic. I include it in my best ten. With keen penetrating vision Kubrick has given us a slice of life as it was....and still is. Let's face it....what has changed? Rampant youths stealing cars, breaking into homes, daubing walls with grafitti, overdosing on drugs, bashing the elderly, involving themselves in murder, rape and terrorism.  What a prophetic film! And how magnificently does Andrew McDowell portray the character of Alex Delarge (under Kubrick's expert direction).  This actor was at the right place at the right time and Kubrick seized the opportunity.  McDowell has never done better than his role in 'A Clockwork Orange'.The various brutal acts performed by Alex and his gang have been amply described by other reviewers.  They are scenes not easily forgotten, and the hatred, disgust and loathing captured in Alex's expression is a credit to his acting ability.Alex's so-called rehabilitation was an interesting part of the film. While 'aversion therapy' is not so much in use to-day because of the introduction of new medications, to have one's neck clamped and eyelids pinned back is an unenviable position to be in and actual torture for Alex. The subsequent testing of the success of the treatment by exposing a naked woman in close proximity to Alex in front of the assessing medical fraternity seemed to me to be primitive to an extreme, but it made good cinema.The media report on Alex's attempted suicide with its political ramifications brought a new sense of power to Alex. As the Government Minister pandered to his every need, even feeding him with a fork. (I laughed outright at this point. It was such a humourous situation).The film does not state what happens to Alex.  It gives us little hope.The best that can be said is that Kubrick thrusts the facts directly at us and just as in the ''aversion therapy' we cannot turn away. This film has such a strong message. What has happened in these intervening years....what have we accomplished to put things right? Sad to say....nothing!",9,3,6,20 May 2002
Stalingrad," An epic drama that impresses
","There can be no real victors in war if we value human life at all.  That so many German and Russian boys should die in the snow-bound wilderness around Stalingrad is a tragedy beyond comprehension.  The camera crew did a great job in bringing to the screen the vastness of Russia with soldiers camouflaged in white struggling on the point of death across frozen landscapes.  Far from home and missing their loved ones the German soldiers are depicted as rough diamonds with kind hearts sharing their last crust of bread with starving Russian children.  The over-all German plan is to take certain cities important in the flow of oil and supply of food to the Russian enemy, but their plans are thwarted when the Russian armies encircle them.  The close fighting is well filmed with lots of explosions, flames and shattered bodies among fallen masonry.  I liked particularly the contrast of the opening scenes in sunny Porto Cervo (where the Germans are celebrating their recent victories) with the tragic scenes which followed when calamity overtakes them.I thought too that the three struggling figures exhausted in defeat symbolised the horrific loss of human life and the futility of war. While none of the actors shone above the others, their characterisations were adequate enough though I got somewhat confused with such a large cast and all the same uniforms.  The lasting impression is not with individual performances but with the over-all mood of this tragic event captured superbly under expert direction.  One soldier says to another:'This will give us the Iron Cross' The reply:'Yes...it will look good on your coffin!'",8,41,53,2 July 2001
The Legend of 1900," They say that you can always get by if you have a good story to tell. Try this one.
","An outstanding feature of this film is the atmosphere developed in all the crowd scenes.  The early morning arrival of the SS Virginian filled to the brim with well-heeled passengers and excited emigrants shouting 'America!' is a most moving spectacle. Another crowd scene is deep down in the belly of the ship where stokers grimy and sweaty are shovelling coal into the open mouths of the fiery boilers.  The whole scene is grim and threatening with steel platforms and steel steps, heavy chains and pulleys, men shouting above the noisy activity. Then again many decks above bring us to the crowded dance floor aglow with the rich and famous out for a good time with wine,women and song. Diector Giuseppe Tornatore handles all these scenes superbly and with true feeling. In all this shipboard activity is a lonely man called 1900. Of unknown parentage he was given that name by stokers down below after being found in a box on the grand piano in 1900. He was born at sea, lived his whole life at sea and could never bring himself to leave the ship. He died at sea. The character 1900 is played by three people - a baby (adorable), a young boy (charming) and a grown man (Tim Roth).  Most people will remember this film for the exciting piano playing competition.  I have never seen such nimble fingers as they rattle over the keys and hammer the piano wires into a fiery temperature.  The photography at this point with its multiple overlapping images of hands and piano keys helps to build the excitement. It's pretty serious business because bets are laid on the outcome of the competition. 1900 has one true friend, a trumpet player.  I like the scene where the two men seated at the piano (with the brakes off) race at a terrifying speed around the ballroom as the ship lurches to and fro in the heavy seas. I have a couple of queries though.  I may have missed something in the film but I cannot recall how 1900 learnt to play so well and who taught him.  But it makes a great scene and the music is exciting and enjoyable.   And that girl....peering in through the porthole as young 1900 woos her with his gentle notes.  What a gorgeous angelic creature who touches the heart of 1900 for a fleeting moment!  Such a small role and yet the glow of her face remains long after the credits fade.",7,3,6,8 October 2001
Enemy at the Gates," Gripping from beginning to end.
","One of the biggest surprises for me was the epilogue which flashed across the screen.  It said that the film was based on the true life story of Sergeant Vassili Zaitsev.  How much was true and how much sprang from the imagination of the scriptwriter's imagination matters not.  The fact remains it's a war film that's up there with the best.  It's another film about the battle for Stalingrad, and there'll probably be a lot more to in the future, because this event was a turning point in favour of Russia and its allies in WW11.  One can't help but compare this film with the German production 'Stalingrad' (1993) because both were produced on the grand scale. 'Enemy at the Gates' is a better production.  I felt more involved as I watched the frightened young Russian soldiers some without guns stumbling on towards the enemy, snatching a rifle from a fallen comrade and charging into the barrage of fire.  The harrowing scenes which followed with bodies lying bleeding in the churned-up mud were heart-rending.  I guess a lot of the set was put together using computer technology.  Some of the distant background looked a bit unreal, but the over-all effect was truly amazing on the giant screen. All the battle scenes were believable as we watched the slaughter of the Russian troops who understandably had lost all hope of victory.  But battles can be won with words as well as guns.  Propaganda can be a powerful weapon. Young Vassili a superior marksman starts to pick off some of the German Officers.  The news (plus the distribution of propaganda pamphlets) starts to spread rapidly among the troops and the general population.  The morale of the Russians starts  to improve as Vassili is painted as a hero.  Jude Law is likeable as Vassili the former shepherd boy now a national hero.  To win the battle for Stalingrad the Germans must destroy this hero worship. Into the scene comes the top Nazi marksman Major Erwin Konig (a splendid role for Ed Harris) whose sole mission is to find and kill Vassili.  The ensuing scenes  are intensely gripping as the opposing marksmen seek each other out amid the ruins of a burnt out department store. I found the display models particularly scary as I wasn't certain whether perhaps they were living beings about to spring, and the glass reflection scene had me almost at breaking point. There is some love interest in the film.  And this was necessary I think to give some relief to the pervading horror of those dreadful days.  The film I thought gave a fairly balanced view of the German and Russian attitudes.  There was brutality on both sides.  Desperation, too.  I came away from the film with the gunfire still ringing in my ears and believing that I too had just been through the hell of Stalingrad.",9,0,2,6 August 2001
A Beautiful Mind," Excellent portrayal of a deranged mind.
","A beautiful mind, a lonely mind, a tormented mind, a frightened mind, a rebellious mind....Russell Crowe portrays in vivid yet controlled detail the degeneration of a mind in turmoil....a sick mind overcome with schizophrenia. Fidgety mannerisms are not pleasant to watch and they grow in number as the malady takes hold. Imagined presence of colleagues at the University where he teaches mathematics and imagined conversations with them suggest that his brain is playing tricks with him. A top psychiatrist called in to examine him confirms his schizophrenia. After undergoing the bizarre shock treatment, the mathematician goes on a course of medication with little promise of cure.The intriguing part of this film is the confusion arising between real characters and imagined characters. This is intentional for we are seeing life through the eyes of a man suffering terribly from mental illness. It is disturbing to watch, yet fascinating. It makes you feel uncomfortable. Watch closely and you will see patterns on a window pane and patterns of shadows across a flight of steps and patterns taking shape in a jumble of letters of coded text. It is almost as if the mind is too active. And lurking in the shadowy background there is always a threatening figure watching him...or is he just imagined? Trying to reason with such an afflicted person is almost impossible. Much of the mental agony is suffered by persons close to him. Just imagine how difficult it must be to live with a person who can scarcely differentiate between what is real and what is imagined. Here is a man who does not believe in luck but who believes that everything can be explained by some mathematical equation. In life he says there are many equations to be solved, but adds the most mysterious of all is the equation of love. In the hands of the make-up artists Russell Crowe makes a wonderful and absolutely believable Mr. John Nash. Indeed his whole portrayal of Mr. Nash's life is most creditable and truly worthy of an Academy Award.",8,0,2,8 November 2004
Love Actually," Love is a many-splendoured thing
","I thought that the world was spinning on its axis because of the big bang billions of years ago, but after watching this film I've come to the conclusion that it's love that makes the world go round.. And what a busy little film it is with so many characters burdened down with so many difficult relationships. At first I was somewhat confused as a multitude of characters were introduced ,but slowly I was able to sort out the couples and their particular problems.It's a happy film set a few weeks before Christmas with the street illuminations decorating many of the scenes. The dialogue is suitably punctuated with songs many of which were familiar to me. I actually found myself tapping my feet in some scenes. This is unusual for me.The large cast had a nice variety of characters, too many to comment on all. I liked Hugh Grant as the English Prime Minister and some of the impossible situations he found himself in. Some of the scriptwriting was surprisingly frank relating to the President of the United States. Love has no boundaries it seems when a young boy makes a determined effort to meet the girl of his dreams by breaking all security rules at the airport. And what a devilish invention the telephone is when it rings at the most inappropriate moments.As Shakespeare said ' The course of true love never did run smooth'. No, it never did and it never will. But that's love actually.",8,0,1,12 February 2008
Scream," A slasher film that's a cut above the rest
","Horror is not my preferred theme in cinema so it's no surprise that ten years have passed before I decided to have a look at this blood-bath of a film.It's about a masked serial killer who decimates a group of high school students knocking them off one at at a time while they party around a television set watching horror films. There's a lot of running and chasing and locking of doors and threatening with up-raised daggers. All this action is scary at first but eventually you get used to it and take it in your stride.The opening scene in which Drew Barrymore alone in her home at night answers the phone to an unknown caller is quite frightening as he whispers instructions in a threatening tone. This sets the mood of the terror that is to follow. We learn that it is inadvisable to venture outside on a dark night or neighbours could find your gutted body strung up in the nearest tree next morning! There is another scene which I found very scary. One of the girls finds herself locked in a garage with the masked killer and there appears to be no means of escape. Suddenly she sees the doggy door at the bottom of the roller door and she attempts to squeeze her slim body through the opening. When her hips gets stuck, the killer activates the roller door and her dangling body is drawn up with the door. Horrible to behold! There is a lot of realistic blood-letting in this movie and characters are drenched in gore. This is as it should be. Not like most movies where a thrust of a dagger leaves not much more than a relatively tiny stain on the clothing.I'm surprised that reviewers have not paid more attention to the character of Billy Looms. Admittedly Skeet Ulrich does little more than stare unrelentlessly into Sidney's face at very close quarters, but just watch his eyes and ask yourself could you trust this character. He convinced me that it is not necessary to shout and scream and threaten with a knife to create a tense scene. Just a smouldering eye contact well-done can send shivers down your spine. And Skeet is a master of this technique.As I said, horror films are not for me. They are usually laughable. I have to admit though that this is one of the best.",8,0,0,11 July 2005
The Queen," Some right royal performances
","This much-talked about docudrama faithfully recreates the frustrating moments at Buckingham Palace following the death of Diana in a car crash in Paris.Award-winning Helen Mirren gives an astounding performance as Queen Elizabeth 11 as she assumes the voice and gestures in minutest detail of the reigning monarch.Wishing at first to brush the whole affair aside as a purely private matter, and urged continually to do so by Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh ( James Cromwell ), she finally gives in to the advice of Prime Minister Tony Blair that a public funeral service be arranged to meet the demands of the public. One could feel the torment that the Queen was experiencing as she often sat alone wondering what she should do next. Her advisers said she should broadcast to the people and it was even strongly suggested that a flag on Buckingham Palace should fly at half mast.Michael Sheen as Tony Blair caught the right feeling as the young and ambitious Prime Minister desperately trying to persuade the Queen to change her mind, to make her realize that times were changing and that she must listen to the cry of the populace. To adhere to the old traditional ways was a perilous attitude and could well end the monarchy.The Duke of Edinburgh gave little support maintaining an aloof and cold attitude throughout. The film makers made him such an unfeeling fellow. As for the Queen Mother (Sylvia Sims) she was portrayed as a rather dowdy creature lacking the true elegance and dignity which she has shown throughout her life.One of the most moving scenes in the film was the moment when Prince Charles (Alex Jennings) entered the room of the French Hospital to view the body of Diana. The atmosphere was suddenly quiet, the cameras remaining at a respectful distance and Charles himself quietly visible beyond the glass partition. Very well done, I thought.I think it must be very difficult to play the role of a living person. One could be in for a lot of criticism. All will agree that Helen Mirren's performance could not be bettered by any living actress. While the film itself might not be everyone's choice for a Saturday night celebration, watching this performance of a truly great actress is a rare opportunity indeed.",8,0,0,9 March 2007
The Sixth Sense," I was on the edge of my seat!
","Some people have powers of perception beyond the normal range of the five senses.  The movie explores this strange phenomenon. Most scenes in this film are dark and shadowy with the camera moving stealthily through doorways, stairways, cellars and attics.  I was on the edge of my seat most of the time not knowing what to expect next but knowing full well that there was something threatening in the shadows.  Several times I leapt in my seat which says a lot for the development of the spooky atmosphere and fine direction.  At first the story is rather confusing because not everything is revealed in the beginning.  It's a case of mental gymnastics as we sort out the clues concerning the various characters.  Bruce Willis is great and his scenes with the young boy hold our attention as we delve into the various possibilities until finally the truth is revealed.  In the opening scenes with the psychopathic intruder we experience our first shock but there are more to follow.  The psychopath shouts too much thus blurring his speech which makes it difficult to comprehend his words.  I enjoyed the argument with the school-teacher in the room which was once a court-house and the 'locked in the attic' scene which scared everybody including the audience. To sum up:it was well acted,well directed, and sets exactly right . 	It has great entertainment value but like most stories about the supernatural not to be taken too seriously.",8,0,0,31 October 1999
The Thin Red Line," Spiritual quality
","A beautiful film with a spiritual quality that comes together like a requiem for those who died at war, not only at Guadalcanal, but in all wars.  The contrast between horrific slaughter, terror and futility of war and the beauty of nature in this tropical paradise captured on film in thrilling close-up has tremendous emotional impact.  The soliloquies of Witt (James Caviezel) bring one almost to tears,  'Where do wars come from?' he asks. Two scenes are particularly memorable - one scene where the company of soldiers under heavy fire struggle up a hillside covered in ribbon grass to take a Japanese bunker on top of the hill - and another where three soldiers as an advance party wade up a river to seek out the exact position of approaching Japanese infantry.  One gets the feeling, it's kill or get killed on both occasions.  All the characters are well played, especially the portrayal of constant fear on their faces on their first combat duty, The make-up department does a wonderful job recreating the tired, dirty, sweating bodies of the soldiers as they push on through the tropical heat without adequate water supplies.  The casualties, too, all bloodied and mutilated lying in the grass create an awful impact.  Against all odds the commanding officer (Nick Nolte) drives the men forward though most question the wisdom of his commands and doubtful tactics. A great piece of acting here by Nick Nolte as the half-crazed obstinate officer.  For me the most emotional scene in the whole film was where a soldier kept alive and active by thoughts of his loved one receives a letter from home.  The message is devastating.  There are no winners in war.  The final scene where Witt is surrounded on every side by Japanese soldiers with guns raised is unforgettable as his steady gaze is directed down the barrel of a gun.  No words are spoken, but we feel every second of this moment.  Great drama. Great acting. I believe this is a well-constructed, well directed, well photographed film.  Everyone should see it and learn from it.",8,1,2,31 December 1999
Happy Feet," A Masterpiece of Artistry
",We have to admire the amount of detailed research and preparation that goes into a magical piece of film work like this. No doubt the MARCH OF THE PEGUINS was a good starting point on which to build ideas. Penguin characters need names. They need voices. They have to be distinguishable from each other. There has to be a story with perhaps a message or two. Various emotions to make us laugh and cry. There has to be an interesting setting. Music and songs to delight us. Adventure and action.This film has it all. We salute the team of artists who made it all possible.Other reviewers have adequately described the story. Bits and pieces of well-known songs have been woven into a simple love story in which Mumble could not express himself in the usual way (through song) but had the gift of nimble feet which tapped out his feelings in a kind of Morse code which finally infected everyone even the intruding 'aliens'.We learn a lot from this film quite apart from the life cycle of the penguin. We learn that everyone is not the same. People have different feelings. We must respect the feelings and opinions of others. Mumble was late in hatching from the egg. His Pa did have an accident with the egg; and the penguin colony was quick to remind him. The one thing they forgot was that everyone is different. We all have different talents.Due credit must be given to the actors who gave their voices to the penguins. They seemed just right. Watch out for the elephant seals who seem to be in a most pessimistic mood when Mumble decides to seek out the 'aliens' who are stealing their fish. There is a real change in mood here as every doubt is raised about Mumble's plan to negotiate.This film won many Awards including an Academy Award. Don't miss it. It's a real winner.,8,0,0,10 August 2007
Gladiator," Vivid action enthralls and repels in bloody combat
","Severed heads roll across the screen, blood spurts from torn torsos and the clash of steel swords keep the action going in a frenzy of gladiatorial combat.  Film buffs who like plenty of action will find it all here and will especially admire the courage and determination of the greatest of all the gladiators, Maximus, a general who brings glory to Rome when he fights and wins the battle against Germania. Russell Crowe who plays Maximus wields a mighty sword against terrible odds.  Maximus through his agility and experience and working to a plan is able to decimate his attackers however many surround him  When the dying Caesar promises that the General Maximus should take over the control of Rome, the choice of candidate is not popular with Caesar's son who promptly sets about the slaughter of his wife and little son.  Russell Crowe shines as an actor in the scene where he discovers the body of his wife hanging from a tree.  This is a scene filled with emotion and heart-break.  The remainder of the story concerns the avenging of this cruel deed.  Those who dislike the sight of blood will have to close heir eyes many times during this film.  The arena scenes are extremely well done on a broad canvas with sweeping views of blood-hungry spectators screaming 'Maximus! Maximus!...' The supporting actors give very creditable performances as they get caught up in the intrigue and dirty tricks department of imperial Rome, but all eyes of course are on Russell Crowe as the sweaty gladiator, man of courage, man of action, hoping, as we all hope that good will triumph over evil.",8,0,0,15 January 2001
The Birds," Absolutely gripping startling cinema
","I suppose Daphne Du Maurier should first be acknowledged for her incredibly original story. The idea that the beautiful birds that we find so wonderful to watch in their winged flight could turn upon and attack with such violence! Then there are the writers of the screen play. Where do they start in a story like this? And next, the big challenge...how to make the birds do what is required of them. Birds have a habit of not following the script. Despite all the anticipated complications, Alfred Hitchcock has not only brilliantly overcome them but has as a result given us one of his very best productions.The film starts off rather lamely when a guy chats up a blonde in a bird shop. Apparently she likes his cheeky approach because soon after she is on her way to his weekend holiday house with a couple of love-birds in a cage. At this point one could switch off; but hold on a minute. Because the blonde wants to present the birds as a surprise she decides to go by motorboat across the bay instead of arriving by car. When a big gull dives down gashing her head, an element of mystery starts to creep into the film. All is not right in this sleepy fishing village. The local schoolteacher acts strangely too.The locals blame the blond for the frightening events that follow. The lovely little village becomes a 'war zone'...a terrifying battle against marauding birds dive-bombing every human being in sight. Watch your head...watch your eyes...run for your life...nail up the doors and windows and don't forget the chimneys! It's a terrifying experience which will leave an indelible impression. Rest assured you will always remember 'The Birds'. The bird attacks are so real they are absolutely believable. All credit to those responsible. If you buy the DVD there is a special feature explaining how it was all done! Just incredible.",8,2,6,4 July 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Brother, tell me when to laugh!
","The gangs of rock-cracking prisoners in the opening scene, all singing a dirge in harmony was a great way to start and promised some startling entertainment to follow.   But no! This contrived comedy with music just went down-hill after that.  Oh dear! just tell me when to laugh. The Ku Klux Klan scene was quite striking though it did not go anywhere, the 'sirens' in their wet clinging garments were nicely seductive, the idea of carrying around a friend (turned into a toad) in a little box was intriguing and a furious escape from a barn all ablaze was exciting enough, but.... May be it was the melodramatic delivery of the lines and the strain of trying to understand the assumed southern accents that got at me.  No sir, this was a wasted evening for me and one of the worst films of the year. My advice, brother, is...forget it!",6,0,2,15 July 2001
