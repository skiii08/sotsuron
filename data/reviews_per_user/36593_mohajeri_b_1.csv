Requiem for a Dream," hypnotics , like the power of drug . !!
","First time i saw this movie , i was thrilled by the story line and performance. From the first shot movie follows a different way . The parallel story lines coordinate each others incredibly in conjunction and support mainstream of the movie in marvelous smoothness . Ellen Burstyn played one of her best roles in recent years . Other actors performed so much profoundly . The dark and dismal atmosphere remains over every sense and very well visualizes looms of its dreadful content ' drug deals ' . The final curtain is the climax of tragedy . The music is another grace which matches magnificently with pictures .It is likely the most horrifying movie has ever made about addiction .",10,0,1,16 January 2013
