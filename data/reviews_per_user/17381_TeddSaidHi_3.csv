Requiem for a Dream," This movie wins the 'no bulls***' award for every movie ever made.
","I really can't say much after what I just saw.  I encourage everyone in the world to watch this movie at least once...  it will open your eyes and protect you.  This movie was so straightforward and it didn't hide much. I'm sorry... usually my reviews are more, but I am completely speechless. Check this film out NOW.",10,0,1,31 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Summarized Perfectly
","Obviously leaving a bit out of the movie version of this incredible story, this is a visible summary.  However, the accuracy at which this movie reflects Tolkein's original story is outstandingly great.  The most important parts of the story were captured, and the less important were scrapped for the sake of keeping the story three hours long, even though seeing the dwarf beg the Lady of the Woods for a strand of her hair would have been amazing, as well as having the dwarf blindfolded on the way to see her.Anyhow...  I most definitely suggest you see this movie, but ONLY after reading the book by J.R.R. Tolkein.  You may enjoy it more if you only read the first book (Fellowship of the Rings) before seeing the corresponding movie rather than reading the Two Towers and/or Return of the King.  Well, I'd love to tell more about this spectacular piece of filmography, but I just saw the movie four times since 12:05 this morning, so I really cannot stay awake much longer.  Take care, and see it!!!!",10,0,0,19 December 2001
Shrek," Stunning animation, great light story
","The previews show a cute summer animated film for all children to enjoy. The truth of the matter is that 'Shrek' is not far from the best animated film to this day.  A story that would be enjoyed by moviegoers of any age and maturity level is hard to find, but Mike Meyers, Eddie Murphey, et all have pulled it off nicely.  The animators broke the mold with the quality of 'Shrek''s animation and set a record that would not be surpassed until Final Fantasy.  Aside from 'Shrek''s great light story, it is full of humor, again compatable with a large variety of levels.  I appload everyone involved in this project and hope that the Acadamy does as well.",10,0,0,25 July 2001
