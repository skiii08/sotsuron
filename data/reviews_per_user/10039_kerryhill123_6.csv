Insidious: Chapter 2," Slight regurgitation of the first movie
","if you asked me to write a summary of the plot for Insidious chapter 2, I would definitely struggle, this film was understandable but difficult to explain.Insidious chapter 2, directed by James Wan, follows on from the first Insidious movie, it follows the same family and is written following straight after the first movie. Insidious 2 revolves round the father of Dalton Lambert, the boy who was 'possessed' in essence in the first film. This follows his father,Josh, who we see murder Elise. This film allows us to find out the mysteries of the first movie in greater detail and understand it better as well as give us a good story, in this sense, it was a good film. I don't think this movie was quite as scary as the first one, and it came across like a regurgitation of the first Insidious. Most of the 'scares' were caused by the sounds, which I must congratulate, Insidious has possibly the most disturbing soundtrack. None of the content was actually that terrifying, yes, it was quite menacing and creepy, but wasn't going to leave me with sleepless nights. The overall mise-en-scene of the film was very good, the acting was good, the editing was not under done or over done. It had some good twists and turns which were interesting and kept me engaged throughout, so it wasn't a bad film. The use of time in the film was confusing and the script was complex making this film extremely hard to explain the plot. A favourite scene, was definitely where Josh throws the kettle at Renai's head, knocking her out. I can't imagine this should of been as funny as it was, but I am guilty of laughing out loud in the cinema at this part. The ending has left me thinking that we will almost certainly see an 'Insidious 3' which I have a feeling will be a major let down, as many 3rd installments in horror franchises are. give it a watch by all means, it has equally good and bad points. It was a very average film, and didn't top the first one. Both Insidious films are pretty much on an equal level.",6,0,1,2 October 2013
Iron Man 3," good but not amazing
","Iron Man 3 follows Tony Stark on his mission to stop the Destructive terrorist 'Mandarin'or more so , Aldrich Killian. Iron Man 3 is the third instalment in the Iron Man trilogy but was not directed by the same director as Iron Man and Iron Man 2, which were directed by Jon Favreau ( who plays a cameo as Happy Hogan, Tony Stark's former bodyguard) Iron Man 3 was directed by Shane Black. Iron man 3 had a $200 million budget and made over $1,000,000,000.One thing I can say about this movie is the lack of 'Iron Man' since Tony Stark was not in the suit for most of the movie which in a way takes the Iron Man essence away from the whole movie. As much as I did enjoy Robert Downey Jr's performance, I felt it was more about him than 'Iron Man'. Much of the time, it isn't Tony Stark/Iron Man fighting the enemies, and even the ending shows Pepper saving the day, which can be seen as quite a positive thing and may please the female audience for the girl power element. The addition of Harley, the child character is definitely a clear sign of Disney's influence, and I don't necessarily see it as a bad thing, but this film was far from dark and we see this with the amount of humour that included. Don't get me wrong, I love the humour as it was clever and definitely gave me a laugh but I would have preferred it to be darker, much like The Dark Knight Rises. The film had brilliant editing and I especially loved the intro with the addition of Eiffel 65, which definitely was a blast from the past! I enjoyed the opening scene and it was a relevant and clever introduction to the storyline. The plot twist with The Mandarin was interesting and at first, I didn't like it too much, purely because the storyline with The Mandarin as an evil, twisted terrorist seemed so much more threatening so I felt a little let down but it was quite a comical twist on the storyline and didn't work out too badly. I would recommend it but I wouldn't expect too much from it as you may be disappointed.",6,0,1,2 October 2013
In Bruges," Not at all bad
","In Bruges is a British black comedy film directed by Martin McDonagh, released in 2008. It follows a pair of hit men named Ken and Ray who are hiding out in the Belgian town of Bruges after Ray accidentally murders a child during one of his jobs. I found this film pretty entertaining throughout, it had clever, witty dialogue which conveyed both characters very well. The characters themselves are very convincing and both very 3 dimensional, the relationship between them both is presented very well as it shows their closeness and shows their emotion despite having a seemingly emotionless job. I thought the dialogue and acting was extremely credible to Farrell as he perfectly conveys Ray's fragile state of mind and presents his character differently to how you'd expect. The story itself was pretty basic but well written and perhaps the only part of the film that let it down was the ending, which I was not fully satisfied with. I feel like it was a little unconvincing and unrealistic with there being a shootout in the middle of a film set and no one seems to take any action and prefers to carry on with their business! I think this was a bit of a silly sequence and although the fate of the characters was relatively appropriate, I still feel it wasn't authentic enough. This film was set in a beautiful location and when it isn't making you laugh or wince, it instils emotion into the viewer with its stunning soundtrack and appropriate cinematography. The cinematography was very revealing for the characters and shows off the setting of the film extremely well. It also intensifies the dialogue and importance of scenes. The editing of the narrative was quite clever and I liked how we found out what Ray had done after he sees two children walking with their parents. It was an appropriate link and therefore a good time to reveal Ray's actions.",7,0,3,5 June 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," emotional, breathtaking but still not perfect
","The only thing that detracted me from giving this movie a ten is exactly why I decided to write a review on it. This film, so far, has been the most negatively received film in the Middle Earth saga, for lack of a better term, and some how I can see why. Lord Of The Rings fans are incredibly dedicated and I think expect more than they will realistically get. These films, to me, are as close to perfection you will ever get. However, I do take issue with a few things in this movie, one being how incredibly short it is, in comparison to its predecessors. The film seems to lack depth and detail and it left me feeling unfulfilled. This is primarily because I have read the book and know that several scenes have been left out. Of course I am aware that the extended edition will be released at some point and this does excite me because the scenes missed are some of the more crucial details in the book by J.R.R Tolkien. Another issue I have is the acting from certain characters, primarily the dwarfs and Bilbo. The scene in which Thorin Oakenshield is being pushed down with a blade by the Pale Orc was incredibly unconvincing, since Thorin's facial expression seemed somewhat relaxed considering he was moments away from death. I think Richard Armitage is an exceptional actor and Jackson is an exceptional director, which leads me to believe that Jackson wanted Thorin to look this way? The final scene between Bilbo Baggins and the dwarfs of Erebor was incredibly cold, considering Bilbo had been on the road with these guys for almost two years, I felt it lacked all emotion. And of course, the return journey was somewhat missed entirely from the film. My hope is that more will be added in the extended edition. The film didn't lack emotion entirely, the final scene between Thorin and Bilbo was absolutely heartbreaking and I found myself crying A LOT! I also especially enjoyed the scene between Thorin and Bilbo when Bilbo tells him about the acorn from Beorn's garden, in which the acting was sensational. It was incredibly emotional mainly because of Thorin's dragon sickness and the way that Bilbo is the only person he can still feel emotional attachment to. Again the CGI in this movie was nothing short of stunning and as near to perfect as you will get, but I do think the scene between Legolas and the Orc was rather ridiculous. I realise this is a fantasy movie with dragons and elves, but Middle Earth is meant to be an ancient time period on OUR Earth today, meaning surely the laws of physics still apply? Right? However, this was just me being picky, all in all, I found the movie to be brilliant, and to top it off, we had the fantastic Billy Boyd performing 'The Last Goodbye' for the credits, which again reduced me to tears. The only reason I couldn't give this movie a 10 was purely due to the fact it wasn't 100% perfect.",9,7,14,4 February 2015
The Conjuring," Pleasantly surprised
","In all honesty, I was never inclined at all to watch The Conjuring since most horrors that are massively talked about, mainly by teenagers, seem to almost always let me down, but this was an exception.In hindsight, I should of been less doubtful as I rate James Wan as an extremely talented director who always seem to pull of scares. I enjoyed Saw and both of the Insidious films so The Conjuring was bound to be at least decent.First off, I think the sound in this film was fantastic, it created suspense, tension and atmosphere and really made your skin crawl as you watched it. It perfectly suited the cinematography and was timed brilliantly. This was hardly a surprise really, and it did sound similar to the Insidious soundtrack. James Wan has a tendency to use contrapuntal sound and we definitely see this here. The cinematography is extremely professional and effective, you see clear use of thirds and the different shots and angles were creative. A particular shot that caught my eye a couple of times was the rotation of the camera and upside down shots, these were unusual and interesting as well as a breath of fresh air into cinematography itself. If there was something important needed in the shot, it was always shown and also created plenty of false expectations in the viewer, which were unusually a good thing. Acting was believable and honest, each character was played perfectly and naturally and there was no cheesy or conventional lines or performances. All actors showed genuine emotion and behaved in a manner that did the story line justice. And of course the story line was relatively impressive too, the story was dark,shocking and held the conventions of horror with interesting and original twists. I must criticise the use of Annabelle the doll, since it really had little to do with the main story at all, I have heard about the proposed sequel but was there really any need to bring the doll into the equation in this film.Either way, this film is definitely worth a watch if you want a genuinely scary horror movie and for once is actually based off a true story!",8,2,3,27 January 2014
The Purge," Not as bad as ratings state
","Only recently watched The Purge after the recent release of its sequel and was surprised to see such bad ratings after the buzz the sequel created. First off, I don't think this is a bad movie at all, the storyline was pretty good, and the idea was incredibly interesting and thought provoking. Problem is at times I found myself thinking about the idea of the purge rather than concentrating on the story. The set for the film was limited as it was mainly focused on the house of the family involved. This isn't necessarily a bad thing because many films can pull off one location sets very well, however I think it would of been beneficial to have seen more perhaps. The acting was pretty decent too, although the kids annoyed me like hell! Incredibly dim witted and useless but hey! thats story telling I guess! The film was overall well made, good cinematography, nothing outstanding but of standard and it seemed relatively believable throughout. One thing I found with this movie is that the ending was a sequence of plot twists, I was half expecting the homeless guy to turn around and say, 'no in fact you're mine!'. Either way I think its safe to say, Anarchy won't be the last we see of these films, and hopefully the following films will tell the story to its potential which is something this movie failed to do. It didn't quite live up to my expectations although I can't quite pinpoint what I did expect anyway. It's worth watching definitely, but reviews will be mixed I believe.",6,0,0,28 July 2014
