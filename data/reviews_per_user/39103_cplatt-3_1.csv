The New World," I wanted to kill myself
","I'm not sure what to say. I registered with this site just so I could tell someone how terrible this movie is. Anyone who rated this movie above a 2 is completely full of SH#T. Starts off so slow and then it just slows down from there. I had a friend ask me how it was and I told them they didn't need to rent this movie, they could just head out to a nice spot in the woods and just sit by a river with just a few people that don't speak to each other and watch the animals for 2-1/2 hours. Please listen to this comment and save yourself. Learn from my mistake. This movie sucks so bad it's amazing.Oh, and I can appreciate art. This isn't art. Try looking at someone in the middle of a windy field for a couple hours and you've seen new world.I hate this movie, it's terrible, please do not watch it. If you rent it and watch it on a first date, I PROMISE you there will not be a second one. If someone tells you this movie is awesome, they're retarded.",1,2,10,5 March 2009
