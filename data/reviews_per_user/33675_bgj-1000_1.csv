","Having avoided most of the pre-release hype i tried to minimise my expectations. As it turns out, it is a worthy sequel - visually powerful and strong acting. A little drawn out in parts but on the whole you don't notice the film length. If you haven't seen the original, do it first. I presume there won't be a follow up - please don't, quit while you're ahead.",8,2,8,7 October 2017
