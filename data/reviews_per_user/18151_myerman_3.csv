Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hmmmmm...also mixed emotions
","I think Jeff Shannon has hit the nail on the head....I would have liked to have seen a lot more of Darth Maul then Jar-Jar Binks and his idiotic slapstick John Ritteresque comic relief. I thought that the climactic lightsabre duel was awesome, but there were other parts of the movie that lacked any sense of timing whatsoever. I know that this first movie needs to get some very serial balls rolling, but Jeezus, how much time do we need (in a Star Wars movie otherwise devoid of emotional charge) to see Anakin walking away from mommy? Sheez.The pod race was excellent--and so were the Tusken Raiders. And the political intrigue, that was pretty cool. But I have to say, it could have been a lot better simply by dropping out one character: Jar-Jar Binks.",Null,0,1,24 May 1999
10 Things I Hate About You," A very engaging remake of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew
","I enjoy wry comedy a lot, and this movie did not fail to please me. There are quite a few bust-a-gut scenes in this movie (especially when the guidance counselor tells Kat that she's known as a 'heinous bitch') as well as a good plot in which various characters grow and learn from their experiences.There are a few plot holes--what happened to Kat and Bianca's mother? Why is Kat such a bitch? (I didn't buy the explanation, as it seemed flat compared to the multidimensionality of the rest of her character.)P.S. The 'Letters to Cleo' band really rocks--they do an excellent cover of Cheap Trick's 'I want you to love me' (not to sure if this is the name of the song--I'm not good with song titles) :)A great date flick.",8,0,0,1 April 1999
The Matrix," A sophisticated SF treat!
","This movie has everything you'd want in an SF spectacular: a great story, incredible special effects, and strong performances from Laurence Fishburne, Keanu Reeves, and Carrie-Anne Moss (hubba hubba). The theater we watched it in was packed to the gills, and everyone reacted to the film's polychromatic emotional effects: funny, wired, violent, and with eye-popping FX.",9,0,0,5 April 1999
