Hereditary," Promising Reviews, Good Start and then...
","This movie started off promising enough and is well acted. First hour looked like it was building to something special. Although even at that point, no real scares.
At around the halfway point one of the actors uttered the line 'Oh for xxxxx sake' to his wife and that virtually signalled a rapid decline with the whole shooting match becoming absurd and downright silly from there on in.
Final point, watch the trailer that lasts 2 minutes - it's better than its source material.",3,5,12,21 June 2018
Knives Out," Enjoyable Romp
","I Really enjoyed this delightful, well written film.
It was acted perfectly tongue in check by the cast, especially Daniel Craig who was superb throughout. Made me laugh and had a great ending, something that's in short supply these days!
I hope more of these are made.
Highly recommended by me!",10,2,7,19 January 2020
Midsommar," I have no words
","Worst movie off all time. What were they thinking.
Would give it minus 10 if I could.
No redeeming features whatsoever.",1,28,50,6 July 2019
