Skyfall," Strong Bond Movie
",I really enjoyed this movie. I thought the action sequences (especially the opening one) were fantastic. My favorite part of the whole movie was Javier Bardem as Silva. I thought this movie did a great job making this villain memorable and gave him a distinct personality that will stick. All of Bond's coworkers were also great. My only complaint with this movie was the Skyfall ranch scene and (without spoiling anything) I just thought it was a stretch given the circumstances they were in. Daniel Craig as Bond is good as can be expected at this point. The movie did a really good job giving us a rememberable Bond film with a personality that I think stands it up against all of the other movies.,8,2,9,25 November 2012
Warrior," Touching and exciting movie overall
","I am not a huge MMA fan, so I didn't know what I was getting into when I decided to watch Warrior (2011) I was pleasantly surprised to see such an entertaining story that really had heart to it. It is about two brothers who leave each other's life very early on. The result is a very tensioned relationship that lasted into their adulthood. The two brothers both end up in a competition together which pits them against each other (a little clich√©d, yes) The fight scenes are very well done with enthusiastic commentary by Bryan Callen and Sam Sheridan that really kept the pace quick. Joel Edgerton does a fine job as the more straight-edged chemistry teacher brother but Tom Hardy really steals the show as Tommy, the more disturbed (ex- Marine) and troubled brother of the too. Hardy certainly has the 'crazed' look down as it shows up many times during the film much to my amusement. Nolte is great also as the father although I would've liked to see more of a conclusion between him and his sons (although maybe it was better off this way...) The story isn't without it's flaws. The school children who set up a drive-thru theater to watch their chemistry teacher battle it out was a little cringe-worthy. The kids were just a little over-exaggerated with their 'Go Mr. C!' signs and their over-sized golf shirts and high-fiving and hollering every time they are shown. The story is obviously ridiculously unrealistic for a couple different reasons but I think the film is not going for realism but trying to tell a heart-felt story. And with that I think they succeeded.",8,1,3,3 February 2013
Apocalypse Now," An exciting war/thriller film
","I had heard lots about Apocalypse Now before I saw it. Mostly about how it was one of the best war movies ever made. After viewing it, I agree with that statement but I feel like it is much more. Besides just presenting the facts, Apocalypse Now takes a more artistic approach. The story is less realistic than other war movies (an American soldier gone crazy, forms his own army deep into Viet Nam.) Thats why I feel like even though it has a lot to offer about Viet Nam, it focuses less about the facts of the war and it's more about the story of Capt. Willard hunting down Kurtz. Great performances by Sheen, Brando, Hopper, and Duvall (who I only wish was in it more) Overall great movie and a great story. You shouldn't be disappointed!",10,1,2,23 October 2011
Jerry Maguire," Great movie with an exciting story and well thought humor
","You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire.",10,0,1,25 November 2012
Rango," Solid Family Movie
","Rango is overall a very entertaining and fun family movie. It is a beautifully looking film, the character designs are all very cool. They are all detailed and fun to watch. The story is also pretty good. The town of Dirt has run out of water and it is up to the stranger Rango to help this town and to prove to himself that he is valuable. The characters in the town of Dirt are all memorable and provided some very cool characters (Spoons and Rattlesnake Jake in particular) It is a film that I think both parents and kids will enjoy and a film that deserves a lot of recognition. There is also a special cameo-type roll towards the end of the movie that you will not want to miss!",7,0,0,4 February 2013
