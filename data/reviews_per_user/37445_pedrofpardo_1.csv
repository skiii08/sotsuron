Scarface," Scarface looks like it was directed by Tommy Wiseau
","I just watch Scarface yesterday. I was surprise for how awful the movie is. I was expecting at least a medium quality gangsters' movie.My first surprise was during the riots at the beginning of the movie. The extras looks like they are playing around. Like kids playing pretending to kick each other. How could Brian De Palma left that scene like that? I though, maybe it's get better later. No, it was worst and worst. Amateur movie with a big budget. Pacino's performance is embarrassing. If someone show me the scene of the first encounter between Tony Montana, his Mom and his 'Sister' Gina, without telling me that it was Scarface and If I magically would forget who were Pacino and Mastrantonio I could swear that it was a Scene from a B movie directed by Tommy Wiseau. I'm not trying to be funny or exaggerated. The overreaction of Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio against the face of the mother is ridiculous and it made the scene laughable. In fact, the only way I think someone could enjoy this movie is watching it to mock every scene like if you were watching 'The Room'.",1,10,21,18 October 2016
