The Benchwarmers," Strange
","I have to say, I definitely left the movie theatre with a sense of wonderment as to what I had just witnessed. I found myself torn between a genuine like for this film and a sense of being ripped off. I suppose you would have to see his movie to fully understand what I'm talking about, but I'll try to convey my point as best I can.Firstly, the movie has funny moments. In fact, it has some really funny moments. The scenes of actual game play are by far the best and funniest scenes in the movie. However, a lot of the dialog is delivered by through such painfully bad acting, you begin to question what exactly the director was trying to achieve. It actually borders on the surreal. It's a lot like watching one of those really strange 'Kids in the Hall' sketches that makes no sense but is funny because it's so strange.Rob Schneider does a great job as the guy who first pulls the team together and talks back to the bullies. David Spade plays a fun character too and fans of his sarcastic quips will not be disappointed. Jon Hedner, however, plays a Napolean Dynamite-esquire character that comes off very poorly. There must have been a big pay check involved here, as this movie will do nothing for his career. Jon Lovitz plays a very bizarre billionaire with the same style and delivery he always used on SNL.All in all, it's a silly movie with no real tension, but with some genuine laughs. The acting, however, is so downright strange, I found it distracting.",6,2,5,12 April 2006
The Butterfly Effect," An excellent film
","I usually don't take the time to make comments on IMDB, especially on big ticket movies, but after reading some of the negative reviews, I just couldn't help myself.Firstly, people need to stop talking about the chaos theory and time travel in the same context.  One small facet of the chaos theory is concerned with predicting the effects a tiny change in the initial conditions of a system will have in the future.  This movie seizes on that fact and bases its plot around the phenomenon.  This is a very, very good movie.  People need to understand that it was not meant to be an accurate movie about time travel.  The main character has the unique ability to travel back in time to different points in his life and alter their outcomes.  This is not so much time travel as it is a paranormal psychic experience.  I don't understand why people are bothering to argue whether or not the movie portrayed the alternative universe theory correctly.  It was a great movie about a character with a PARANORMAL gift. The acting was as good as anything Hollywood has put out in the last few years.  Ashton was great.  I was able to take him seriously throughout the entire movie.  People need to give their damn heads a shake.  Go see the film. 
I suppose I really enjoyed the rather black atmosphere the most.  It reminded me a bit of Donny Darko; another fine picture.  I watch quite a few horror movies, and this one still had me jumping from time to time.  Some of the action is predictable, some is surprising.  I got my money's worth and would advise anyone who enjoys a good thriller with a supernatural slant to go out and see it while it is still in theaters.",Null,0,1,22 February 2004
The Simpsons Movie," A good effort
","Ultimately I feel that Simpsons fans WILL be satisfied with this movie. The bottom line is, this movie is funny. The gags and one liners are pretty much what one would expect from the writers and the animation is quite good. If you like the show you will probably like the movie.That being said, I don't think there is anything really remarkable or special about this piece. I have heard the criticism, 'It's just like one long episode,' repeated over and over again. I don't think that's really the case here. In a lot of ways, I don't think there's really much of the same 'feeling' that the episodes have. For a show that is driven by so many diverse characters, I would have expected more interaction and complexity. The plot is a standard morality tale focusing most of its energy and screen time on the Simpsons themselves. Although the movie is funny, it lacks the contribution of many of the characters that have made the show so enjoyable. The plot is far more outlandish than what most of the episodes offer, and I felt that this was somewhat off-putting. The post modern, self referential tone has begun to run thin. I gave this movie a 6, as I feel that it WAS indeed funny, but far to disorganized to warrant a higher score. See it, if only to lament how good the show used to be.",6,3,5,20 August 2007
