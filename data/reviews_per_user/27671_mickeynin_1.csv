The Blair Witch Project," The most not so scary movie.
",I was sooooo disappointed in this movie.  Kept waiting to get scared and it never happended.  The acting was great but that is the only good part about the film.  I sat at the edge of my seat waiting to be scared and all I got was a big let down.,1,0,2,9 October 1999
