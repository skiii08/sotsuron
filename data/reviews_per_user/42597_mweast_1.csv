Mission: Impossible III," Very good movie
","I don't understand the reasons behind some of the comments about this film. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by it - I think it was outstanding, and significantly better than the first two MIs.The action was non-stop, and it wasn't of the (seemingly typical nowadays) special effects/mindless variety. Well, some of it was, but mostly the movie was intriguing and well done. I even liked Cruise in this move, which is a stretch for me (since he's completely full of himself in most movies).I suppose critics can criticize (what else do they have to do?) some of the background stuff, like why a secret agent would have dreams of living a mundane second life (anyone see 'True Lies'?),but during the movie nothing seems incredible enough to interrupt the flow of the movie (no infamous 'What?' moments). I did find some questionable logic occasionally, as in most films, but again nothing terrible or even especially obvious - I'm not going to point any out, since I think it detracts from the film for those who haven't seen it.The dialog is good, the intrigue elements are generally involving rather than obvious, and the misdirection was done pretty well e.g., although I'd already figured out Samuel L Jackson was not the bad guy, and I'd figured that the Rabbit's Foot was real, I didn't have any clue about Cruise's wife.Overall, I think this was one of Cruise's best films, and a very good way to spend an afternoon.",9,0,1,1 June 2006
