The Ring," This is not scary
",After reading many of the reviews listed here for this movie I was looking forward to seeing the 'Ring'. I could not believe how bad this movie was and I like a lot of movies and am not the type to bag on a movie just because it is popular. (SPOILERS) Too many holes: how did she make the tape? why was she evil? how did the images get on the tape? the images of herself were on the tape also? Why did the police not care about any of the people dying? Was there a phone in the well? (being sarcastic) I could go on but will not. I have given this awful movie too much of my time already. If you like a movie that has to use loud noises to get you to jump or to stay awake then this is for you.,1,2,6,21 October 2002
Erin Brockovich," I do not understand what is so great about this movie
","My dislike for this movie could be my bias towards Julia Roberts but I did not believe this to be all that great of a movie. To me, Julia's portrayal of Erin was basically the same character she used in Pretty Woman and another rags to riches story that I am really tired of from MS Roberts. I have a friend who knows Erin Brockovich and Julia did not do her much justice and over played her character in some ways. She did  not do everything herself as the movie would have you believe. What is the major difference from this movie and the John Travolta movie A Civil Action? Frankly, his character was a whole lot more enjoyable.",2,8,21,24 September 2001
We Were Soldiers," A very Good Movie
","I am very surprised at the number of people who can write that the battle scenes seem so fictional and try to compare with Private Ryan or Black Hawk Down or other war movies. Have any of you even been in the military to make such a comment? I have 20+ years (Navy SeaBees and Army Infantry) and feel most of the action was very good. As one reviewer puts 'The battle scenes did not show us anything new'. Should Wallace had made up unrealistic battles scenes. I think too many of you are wanting the special effects to rule the movie. I will agree that some of the dialogue is 'hammed' up but maybe some of you critics should include a better line in your review. My guess is that most critics will be just that, critics but can offer so viable alternative as to what would be better. This section seems to becoming like sports talk radio. Everyone is a critic but few are players or actors.",8,1,2,17 July 2002
Armageddon," This is pure entertainment, nothing more
","I have read many of the reviews and some of you really need to relax. Sure this movie had plenty of cliches and a totally unbelievable plot but who cares? I read one so called critic from Sweden on how it was another U.S. cowboy saves the day hero movie or close to it. I happen to like heros willing to sacrifice themselves for a higher cause but then I never really hear about heros from Sweden, France or most European countries. England is a huge exception! I would think that Europeans would be thrilled with American Courage but they obviously have short memories of the sacrifice many American heros made to keep all of them from speaking German. The rest who did not like this movie to the fact that it bothers them must have a pretty stress free life if this is what they waste their energy on.",7,1,2,24 September 2001
Wanted," I just do not get it
","I do not understand how any logical person can find this film (I am being nice) entertaining. The movie viewing public has only ourselves to blame when it comes to Hollywood and them release crap like 'Wanted'. Over the top action scenes with totally unbelievable stunts. The characters are not even likable which may have given me something to appreciate. I can suspend belief in sci-fi and other genres, but Wanted is just crap in my humble opinion. Obviously I am in the minority here with this movie receiving a 7.7 rating. My guess the A. Jolie lovers are giving the high marks for this so-called entertainment..",3,17,61,30 June 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Outstanding!
","For whatever reason, I did had reservations about going to see Million Dollar Baby. I am extremely happy that I decided to go because this movie was totally entertaining from start to finish. It simply grabs you and does not let up. Million Dollar Baby will be a keeper for my video collection! Eastwood, Freeman, and Swank all give superb performances and I sincerely hope they are given their due at the Oscars in March. The character's developed throughout the film and the actor's portrayal of them made the characters believable. Granted a few of the fight scene's were a bit over the top but then it is still Hollywood. What I like the most is the lack of special effects and the total concentration on the development of the story. Borrowing from Roger Ebert: Thumbs Way UP!",7,7,10,5 February 2005
