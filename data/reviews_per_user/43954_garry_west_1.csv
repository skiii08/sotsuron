United 93," A must see. You don't have to be American to enjoy it
","The tragic events of 9/11, in particular, the huge loss of life that occurred at the Twin Towers could easily provide enough material for several feature films, so it comes as some surprise the first major film release inspired from 9/11 would be the lesser known story of those who lost their lives on United 93, the only plane not to reach its target. Also surprising is the even-handedness with which British director Paul Greengrass has brought to U93 as this film could very easily have succumbed to blatant flag waving, a 'tribute' to the American spirit (a la Ladder 49). Hell, if Jerry Bruckheimer had gotten hold of it he'd have had Arnie on the plane, and I'm sure Arnie would found a way to stop the film from crashing. Cynicism aside though, Greengrass's devotion to verisimilitude gives U93 a huge edge over anything that 'Hollywood' could have done with this film. Greengrass's use of the hand-held camera, nauseating in Bourne Supremacy and serviceable in Sunday Bloody Sunday, works a treat in United 93, conveying so well the fear and desperation of the plane's passengers, but also the anxiety of the terrorists themselves, especially before the actual hijacking. The tension is un-paramount, as is the confusion Greengrass captures in the FAA and Air-Defence headquarters, as people struggle to comprehend and control the situation. Greengrass's decision to move the film around in between places other than the actual plane works extremely well, with one particularly harrowing scene taking place inside the New York Airport control tower as they see they second plane coming in low (at this stage the first plane was considered a possible accident) before cutting to CNN footage of the impact as FAA workers watch stunned. U93 is a great example of how such dramatic material can still be done with subtlety. There is no constant and dramatic score, but somehow Greengrass creates incredible tension right until the last moment. This film is ultimately about the heroism of the plane's passengers, their efforts to not simply 'lay down' is compelling. The fact that we know the end result of the film does not detract one iota. As of yet I haven't seen Oliver Stone's World Trade Centre, and though Stone can critique America has well as he can celebrate it, I cannot imagine it being half as good as United 93.",Null,2,4,23 December 2006
