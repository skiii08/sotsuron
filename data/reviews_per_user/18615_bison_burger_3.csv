10 Cloverfield Lane," Should have been titled differently, takes away from Cloverfield
","You can throw out any relation between the two movies, yes, regarding the story, but 10 Cloverfield Lane lacks the mystery, creativity, and realness of Cloverfield. After watching this movie it is clear that the producers were banking on the Cloverfield name to get some greenbacks and it worked ($40 mil gross with a $15 mil budget). The end leaves no mystery. Also, did anyone else notice all of the rip-offs from War of the Worlds and Men in Black? The farmhouse. The alien ship arm that grabs things up to the ship. The overused throw-the-device-into-the-alien-mouth-and-watch-it- blow-up trick. John Goodman is Tim Robbins in War of the Worlds. The whole film is just too cheesy and unoriginal. It did have a few moments of good direction, but not enough to save it for the 'good film' category. If it had been titled 'War of the Cloverfield Lane in Black' like it should have been, it would have been a bust on its own. Go see Cloverfield the original again for a really, really good film. I felt ripped off.",4,4,11,26 March 2016
Unbroken," Incredible story, horrible screen adaptation
","Louis Zamperini's story of survival was robbed of all feeling and emotion in this screen portrayal. Jolie has cast a very flat, laconic, and unconvincing crew of young Abercrombie models who lack the depth of seasoned actors who would have otherwise convinced us that there was actual pain and suffering throughout this. After a month afloat on a raft the three men's hair was well-groomed and one even had a goatee (are there razors in the survival kit?). I felt like I was watching Casper Van Dien in Starship Troopers; if you have seen this movie you will know exactly what I am taking about. Read the book - it will give you the emotion and satisfaction you are entitled to from this survival story.",2,254,403,2 January 2015
Alien: Covenant," Absolute garbage from my hero director
","Remember when Alien was aboutÂ…the alien? Hey! Here's an idea; we know what scares people. Throw that out the window and let's just take sniveling, weak characters and some CGI and try to loosely tie together 2 other movies with a weak plot. Yeah. Great idea, Sir Ridley. I am catching the next shuttle to Mars and making an appointment with Rekall, Inc., to have any memory of this movie forever erased from my head. There are several major issues with this film:-There is no strong protagonist. After the bumbling captain (Billy Crudup) is killed off, the teary- eyed, whiny and weak Daniels takes over (if you call it that). All of the human characters are weak, stupid, insubordinate, or a mix of all 4 and are constantly crying. You will never like any of these people. -A weak story and plot. Wrong planet, wrong premise, and incorrect segue into what will be the original Alien movie. No explanation needed. -Don't morph the alien. We don't breathe in the alien from spores. There are not 50 different variations of this alien. We are too confused and dumbfounded by this plot to fake interest in new and unexciting variations of the alien. This whole movie is a mess from beginning to end. Why in the world would Scott wreck such a beautiful concept? True horror is simple, unseen, and magnificent. It is clear that Ridley has sold out to the big studios and has been forced to pollute this franchise with Avenger-esque flash and fury because we are not allowed to think and imagine anymore. We can only sit while the whims of the studios are rammed down our plugged-in throats for two hours.",2,29,52,16 June 2017
