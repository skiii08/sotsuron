The Blair Witch Project," It was different
","I didn't find this movie very scary or entertaining. Probably because the hype is more believable than the movie. The poor quality and constant jerking of the camera gave me a headache. The ending was predictable too. I wouldn't say this a bad movie, just a disappointment. The only award this movie should get is for best marketing of a low budget film.",Null,1,1,1 August 1999
