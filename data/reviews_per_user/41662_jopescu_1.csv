Sucker Punch," Great Movie - Promises and Delivers well
","Sucker Punch, just watched it, so the main plot elements are still in my mind as I write this review. First off, unlike what some think, I feel that this is one of the better movies released in this few years. I have considerably high expectations for movies that I watch, and I am glad to say that Sucker Punch met my expectations. CG effects aside, the story can be considered to be quite emotional, with the many turns and twists, ups and downs in the story aptly reflected in the characters' emotions and expressions. In my opinion, this is how I interpret the story. The basic foundation of the entire movie is, I feel, a story about freedom. This is supported through the 'hallucinations' and thoughts Baby Doll have while dancing. The first one when they attempt to get the compound map is that of the girls being Anti-Nazi fighters. The fact that they take on what seems to be the entire military might of the Nazis, can be interpreted, in my opinion, as a reflection of the Freedom fighters in WWII against the Nazis. All in all, subtle reflections of the fight for freedom can be seen throughout the story. That's why I don't really agree with the people who say that Sucker Punch is a mindless movie with girls and guns. In my opinion, I feel that this movie is one that is full of subtle ideas and symbols - one that can be compared favorably to other movies, like Inception. As for the girls and guns, that might just be the way Zack Snyder wants to bring his message across, which I don't have any fault with.In conclusion, great movie, 4/5, a must-watch for movie-goers who want a movie which stays and lingers long after the viewing.",9,4,7,12 April 2011
