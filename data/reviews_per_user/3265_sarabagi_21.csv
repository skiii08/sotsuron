Mother!," dont watch the trailer
","The trailer is very misleading and you expect something totally different. But okay, i opened up to it and i loved it. The acting was amazing and i'm one of those that didnt get the symbolism right away. After i did i loved it even more. Its so confusing at times and it just wont stop getting agressive. This movie has no fear and thats why i liked it so much",9,0,0,13 March 2019
