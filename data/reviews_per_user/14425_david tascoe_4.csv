Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For the 'Star Wars' Fans!
","This is a comment for all you 'Star Wars' fans who hated Episode I and II and don't feel if worthy of being called 'Star Wars' First off, this new trilogy is vastly superior to the original trilogy.  The story lines in Episodes IV, V, and VI are so simplistic and childish compared to I,II, and III.  Finally the Star Wars universe has matured into a real movie instead of the Saturday Morning Cartoons that were the first three.  Don't get me wrong I am a HUGE Star Wars Nerd (that's right with a capital 'N') and should be embarrassed by the amount of knowledge that I know, but I am also a movie buff and I can tell the difference between a good movie and a great one.  Sure the acting is bad in I, and II but I guess none of you watched Mark Hamill or Carrie Fisher closely.  Everyone complains about Jar-Jar Binks.  First off let's rule out the whole discriminatory towards Black people thing because both the designer and actor of the character were black.  I believe it was Comdian/Actor Whoopi Goldberg (Who can neither be funny nor act) who first complained about Jar-Jar, and I have no idea why anyone would listen to her.  Second, George Lucas does not make these movies to satisfy the Star Wars geeks.  THESE MOVIES ARE MADE FOR CHILDREN, and you all must realize that.  Third, I take it no one noticed the Ewokes in ROTJ.  Come on, little furry munchkins taking on an imperial army of seasoned fighters??  Bottom line is this, these movies are made by George Lucas.  Anything he does with the saga is his business and his buisness alone.  If you don't like it, don't watch it!",Null,0,1,3 June 2002
The Big Lebowski," THE DUDE!!!!
","WOW!!!  That's all you can say about the comic genius that is this film. Not only is the trio of The Dude, Walter and Donnie hands down the best comedic team ever (Sorry Three Stooges fans but they were NEVER funny), but the story line behind this movie is a great dramatic thriller.  The offbeat characters such as 'The Jesus', Brant and Liam add to the hilarity of this flick.  This is easily one of the greatest movies of all time, and the Coen Brothers will be forever etched in time as two of the wittiest screen writers/directors of all time!!!  See this movie at all costs!!!",Null,0,0,30 May 2002
Mulholland Drive," What?
","Are you serious??  What is this movie doing on IMDBs 250 Greatest films, and especially at 90??  Look, I know that I am going to upset a lot of David Lynch fans (OH NO) but this movie IS NOT GOOD AT ALL!!!  The whole movie just leaves you confused as to what is going on, the only ray of hope is the intimate scenes between the main characters (Thank you Mr. Lynch)  But the fact that you have to read on the internet what the movie means is proof enough that the movie is terrible!  Remember kids, just cause a movie is different, doesn't make it good!!!",Null,1,1,31 May 2002
Donnie Darko," ARE YOU SERIOUS???
","If you are reading this and are a intelligent let me warn you. DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!!  This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen!!!  Do not be swayed by these positive posts!!  The fact that this movie is 136 on the top 250 Movies of all time is an insult and a mockery of the IMDB list.  The plot was horrible and the idea behind the flick was obtuse and ridiculous. This movie spells career ender.  (Patrick Swazye is in the movie for god's sake)  If you are thinking of renting this movie, you might as well just send me your $3.50 (or however much it costs you to rent a movie) and I will call you up and tell you a story!  This director tries to be clever by doing nothing more than making a 'different' film.  This director (Richard Kelly) should never be allowed to touch a camera again!!",Null,0,0,24 May 2002
