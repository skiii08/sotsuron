50 First Dates," A Terrific love story if there ever was one.
","This was an excellent movie. Drew Barrymore, plays a charismatic free spirit who doesn't remember anything from one day to the next, she retains her long term memory though. Adam Sandler is a ladies man who after meeting Lucy (Barrymore) decides that he isn't interested in living that way anymore, so he spends everyday meeting and re-meeting Lucy, just to spend some time with her. This movie is sappy and repetitive, but its also original, hilarious and quirky and holds onto you long after the film is over. Barrymore and Sandler are fabulous together as they are in The Wedding Singer, and they really show a true love story. I really enjoyed it. Please at least watch it, I personally am going to go buy my own copy.",Null,0,0,24 June 2004
