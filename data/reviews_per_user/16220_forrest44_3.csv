Catch Me If You Can," Fun in sadness
","Aside from Schindler's List, Catch Me If You Can is my favourite Steven Spielberg film, in which I believe something common between us teenagers is reflected home-- fear to see our parents' divorce. Frank's life as an economic criminal began right after his parents' announcing divorce. He first did this just for living, and then the thought of reunion his family took over. Like many teenagers, Frank loves his parents so much, as can be told through the minutia that Frank wants his mother to quit smoking, but they, just like many parents, just seem to ignore this, as an only child, I can't help but feeling extremely sad about it. Each pair of parents should pay attention to this brilliant piece of work, 'cause sometimes you just have no idea about how your children love you! Frank made every effort trying to reunion his parents, but each time his father turned him down. Every crazy step Frank took was related to this purest wish, nothing seems matters when compared with it, even going to jail. His father's death made up his mind to visit his beloved mother, who was happy with her new family, Frank alone outside in Christmas, urging Carl to put him in the car not to be seen by mom, not to worry her. I just can't help laughing and crying each time I saw this movie. Steven Spielberg is amazing! He handle the delicate feeling of the many Franks and the carelessness of parents so very well and accurately. A tragic rather than a comedy. A triumph deserves recommended.",10,3,6,16 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," a very eastern-style film
","As one of the many westernlised Chinese, I watched Brokeback three times to catch its eastern style, which stands for connotation, oppression, and so on. Each time you watch it, your feeling for it goes deeper and deeper, thanks to Ang Lee's heart-and-soul work. As Ang Lee said in an interview about Brokeback, everyone longs for such a relationship in a lifetime like Jack Twist and Ennis Del Mar had. And the movie does give both emotional and calm insight to what true love is all about. Under the surface of peaceful scenes are bitter struggle against the reality as well as themselves. Brokeback Mountain is lucky to be found by those who believe in love, and I wish I knew how to quit it.",10,21,42,14 April 2006
Forrest Gump," a movie to affect your outlook on life
","If there should be a movie for you to remember in a lifetime and to learn everything about life when in confusion or when disappointed by the surrounding world, it would definitely be Forrest Gump, which speaks for an optimistic and innocent outlook on life whatever seems bothering happened around. On the contrary the 'clever' people live every day under pressure or feeling of loneliness, longing for the age of innocence, singing 'yesterday, all my trouble seems so far away...', when Forrest says 'life is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you're gonna get' and steadily moves on,achieving the true meaning of life. Besides, I was deeply moved by three scenes in this masterpiece,which I'd like to share. The first is Forrest's shouting 'I want Bubba!' The second is when Forrest asked his dying mother about his destiny, and she for the last time said 'life is like a box of chocolates, Forrest, you never know what you're gonna get.' And the third, also the most touching scene occurs when AIDS-infected Jenny said to Forrest: I wish I could have been with you then' and the answer came from Forrest as 'You were.' Most unexpected and powerful. All in all, Forrest Gump is one of my favourite of all time, and I would commend it to everybody.",10,1,4,14 April 2006
