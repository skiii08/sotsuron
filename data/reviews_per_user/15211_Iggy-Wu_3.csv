The Blair Witch Project," Sure it's cheap, but not in a bad way.
","After reading through multiple IMDB user posts on this movie, I wasn't sure if this low budget film would be one of the best and scariest horrors ever, or just a boring and laughable attempt at moviemaking.  Which was it? Number 1, all the way!  This was the best horror movie I've ever seen, even surpassing the original Psycho. With an extremely original approach this movie succeeded in engrossing me. Then it freaked me out!  It was one of the scariest movies ever, with an equally freaky ending.  In fact, I was quiet for hours afterwards, not wanting to break the spell it put me in, I just sat and analyzed the ending. This movie is NOT for everyone.  If you prefer pointless, bloody, and need I say FAKE, slasher films, you'll probably shun this 'imposter' to the horror genre.  I thought it was delightfully original, with wonderful acting, and a seamless and completely believable plot.  That's why I gave it a 9 out of 10.",7,0,1,10 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A waste of time
","This contains some slight spoilers, but if you do see this film, I doubt you'll fault me for 'spoiling' this kitsch.This film shouldn't be called Star Wars. After watching it I felt like I was completely robbed of two hours of my life. The acting is terrible (especially 'Ani'). Jar Jar is the Anti-Christ, and if it wasn't for Episode II, I would have lost all faith in George Lucas. The dialogue is pathetically unintelligent (like the droid who says, '...Does not compute. Oh wait, uh, your under arrest.') The film feels like it's made for a crowd of below average kids. And only about 30 minutes of the film is important to the storyline of the Star Wars epic.In all reality, George Lucas should trash the film (although I suspect Jar Jar Binks really directed it), find a new kid to play Anakin, burn all evidence of Jar Jar Binks, and remake the core film as a short. Keep only the parts that are needed for the story. No stupid pod race simply to appease the uncultured masses that are hungry for any action no matter how absurd. A simple reference to Anakin's ability to fly pod's (something that 'no other human can do,' symbolizing his Jedi-like reflexes). Darth Maul really shouldn't die yet (considering he can take on two Jedi at once), and if he does have to die don't make it so pathetic. Just because he's the bad guy doesn't mean he has to be so incompetent that he can let Obi-Wan pull himself out of a pit, jump over his head, grab his light-saber, turn it on, and slash him from side to side, before he can simply stab him. Darth Vader knew what it was like to be a villain; he was competent. Now they have to make the villain extremely competent, at first (so there is a good sword fight), then drop his intelligence to that of a storm trooper at the end (because the masses need closure; they wouldn't like to see the bad guy get away).Basically, this is a bad formula film. The problem is, it was created by the creator of some of the best films of all time. It had such potential, it had such high standards to live up to, yet it couldn't even surpass the standard formula film. I felt Starship Troopers was more enjoyable than this; and that's saying something.",5,0,1,18 May 2002
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Maybe censorship's a good thing.
","I have always loved the TV show.  Not afraid to make jokes out of anything, I rarely saw an episode that I wouldn't give at least 7 out of 10.  The movie was different.  It's like when the burden of censorship was lifted, they spent all they're creative inspiration on nothing but uncreative, unoriginal, and need-I-say humorless vulgarity.  It was used purely for shock value, and with the amount large of movies out that are 'worse' than South Park, not even that worked.  I though that it was a major let down, and I cannot believe that it's the same hilarious show that airs of Comedy Central.  If you want to see a dirty movie that's actually funny, skip South Park.  Watch American Pie.  It's actually funny.",2,1,9,10 August 1999
