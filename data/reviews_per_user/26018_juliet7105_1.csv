Sucker Punch," I don't agree with the critics - I liked this movie
","OK, for me this movie was hard to watch in places but I liked this movie. However for me whether intended by the director or not, it was a very symbolic movie. As someone who was abused and is close to one who lived very much her reality, the symbolisms were apt. The brothel, the dancing all of that, it took the power away from her abuser, her action world, slaying dragons, her dragons, empowering her, helping her endure, and to persevere. Those who have lived extreme abuse do live primarily in their head. However I will say this movie was slanted with an anime, superhero kind of vibe to appeal to a broader audience, to wow with special effects etc. But you can see meaning in it if you know what you are looking at.",9,3,9,28 March 2011
