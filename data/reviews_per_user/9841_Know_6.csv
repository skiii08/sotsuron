The Lobster," I enjoyed it.
",The people that hate it dont understand that it's an allegory for modern dating. You look at an app like Tinder and its just as ridiculous. The definitely laughed a few times and I found some parts cruel but that's what good movies do. They make you feel stuff.If you liked The Life Aquatic... you'll enjoy this. It really is a dark Wes Anderson type movie. I gave it a 7 because it can be slow at times.,7,0,1,19 May 2019
Iron Man 3," How do you get blown up twice?
","Of all the ridiculous mistakes they made, the one that is unforgivable is why they needed to blow up Aldrich Killian twice? He was blown up in the Iron Man suit. Vaporized. And then...he wasn't. Pepper Potts has to pull an Underworld/Resident Evil maneuver and kick a grenade at him and blow him up again. How cheap.I gave 4 stars for the CGI and the airplane scene. There was so much other stuff that stunk like Rhodey not even trying to save himself. You're the Iron Patriot for chrissakes. Maybe they should put a Marine in that suit. Stark finds a 10 year old who acts like he's 35.Last but not least: the most accomplished actor in this movie is reduced to playing Keanu Reeves from Bill and Teds Excellent Adventure. That dude is KNIGHTED. SIR Ben Kingsley. You don't waste that kind of talent!",4,3,6,7 May 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," Solid flick
","Don't listen to the critics. They wanted more dirt but Queen was involved and probably told a story that was closer to the truth. It was tastefully done, funny, and moving. They didn't use Freddie to air out old grievances. Malek was great.",9,6,8,24 November 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Meh.
",I watch a lot of films and frankly this one had no punch. There are about 3 or 4 interesting scenes; the rest is just dead space. I love his other films but this one was a dud for me,6,7,12,4 August 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Loved it
","It was funny, action-packed, and gets you right in the feels. The visuals were stunning and frankly, the movie wasn't bogged down with some silly romance which is what kills it for me in other sci-fi movies. They keep that to a minimum and ramp up the humor a notch instead. Without giving away too much, they've toned down Kylo Ren a bit as well and actually make a tongue-in-cheek joke about that as well.Only the fanboys who are in way too deep are giving this bad reviews. Take 100 of them and put them in the room and they will give you 100 half-baked ideas on what the franchise should do. They don't realize how hard this is with icons dying and other icons just simply wanting out and then having to introduce new characters and maintain the narrative that they've been at war for over 40 years. That's a long time.I'm old enough to have seen episodes 5 and 6 in the theaters and I'm telling you, this movie is as good if not better than Empire. It wasn't perfect but who cares? Neither was Empire. There were some obvious scenes that borrowed from stuff you've seen before like Battlestar Galactica and previous SW movies but again, so what?Let's face it, you're gonna see it anyway so sit back and enjoy.",9,1,2,15 December 2017
Alien: Covenant," Alien Covenant doesn't break any new ground
","In short, the Aliens franchise is now Friday the 13th. The same killers, killing in the same old way.And the victims... It's kind of funny that Earth sends these allegedly well-trained crews into space on these super-expensive missions only to have them almost immediately and *inexplicably* botch the mission. How do you train a crew for 10 years and they go off the rails that fast?Here's the thing...back in the 70's when Alien started, films were very director driven. They had substance. In today's producer-driven Hollywood, they do what's safe and lucrative. Ridley Scott is not exempt from this. He had a chance to do something interesting with Shaw and the Engineers and just flat out whiffed. This is my last Aliens movie and I'm not too optimistic about Blade Runner 2049 either.",5,7,16,20 May 2017
