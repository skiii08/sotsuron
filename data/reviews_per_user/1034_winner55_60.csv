Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Master and student should not reverse roles
","Kill Bill I was a delightful surprise, living up to its hype as Tarantino's comic-tinged homage to Chinese and Japanese action-genre films. I could easily imagine all the old directors from Toei Studios having a blast watching Tarantino's final sword-fight scene, a loving imitation of all their samurai reincarnation or Shogun's Ninja films. Then Tarantino had to go and release this pap and spoil everything.There are two principle problems with this film. First, Tarantino decided he didn't want to do genre any more. KBII is a 'serious' film, about such weighty topics as guilt and redemption and love and death and all those other philosophical topics Woody Allen used to poke fun at before he decided to become a 'serious' filmmaker, too.Well, maybe Tarantino could have pulled that off - he didn't do so bad in Pulp Fiction - but he makes what for me is one of those mistakes a film fan can not forgive another film fan for making: he trivializes his predecessors.Although this film has a large chunk at the beginning paying tribute to the old Shaw Bros. studio (which the first film promised but never got around to), the principle references in this reference-laden film are to the films of Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone. And unfortunately, in deciding to make a 'serious' film, in order to deal with these references, Tarantino decides that Peckinpah and Leone made typical genre films (i.e., not 'serious' films), and that therefore it was up to a better director (himself) to make a 'serious' film from their raw materials.Well, here's the news, Quentin. The Wild Bunch is the American version of Homer's Iliad, and all you've managed to come up with is a Hallmark greeting card that doesn't rhyme. Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West is the Cistine Chapel of a modern Michaelangelo, and all you've given us here is a color-by-numbers Norman Rockwell copy.What in the name of heaven could Tarantino have been thinking of by trying to 'out-serious' directors we know perfectly well he admires?What we get here are cartoon versions of moments from Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia and Once Upon a Time in the West. And that stolen Ennio Morricone music! sure it worked in KBI, because that was homage to Asian genre films and Asian genre films did that sort of thing all the time; but if you're going to get serious, it's time to get original; and, for heaven's sake, Morricone is still alive, I'm sure he'd have been glad to write a new score.Finally, I should mention an obvious influence on this film that Tarantino would probably not want mentioned - the films of the Coen Brothers. Although they started earlier than Tarantino, they are still technically of the same generation as he. I'm not talking plagiarism - the Coens have done their share of 'homaging' with and without credit to the originals. But Tarantino can't afford to try to 'out-serious' filmmakers still making films. Especially since the Coens know how to do an homage with respect.What Tarantino ends up with here is a bunch of scenes that keep banging into each other like box-cars on a (slowly) derailing train. Better it wasn't made. Skip it.",1,23,45,26 June 2006
Walk the Line," pleasant surprise: (re)discover the legendary 'Man in Black'
","I took a while to get to this picture. Cash is one of the few musical artists in recent history for whom I have the unqualified respect, first because he was a great songwriter and singer, but, more importantly, because he was real. He never hesitated to do what he thought to be the right thing, he always spoke bluntly and directly, he judged others by their natures and essentially without prejudice, and he never pretended to be other than who and what he was. His autobiographies are painfully honest. He was a simple man with an unfathomable depth. This would be a better, stronger nation if all American artists were this thoughtful and yet also this open. Cash, not Ginsberg or Dylan, fulfilled Walt Whitman's hope of an 'everyman' American poet.So obviously I wasn't expecting much from a film about Cash made in Hollywood, the capitol of masks, lies and hypocrisy.Thankfully, the Cash family was in on the production of the film. It turns out to be a pleasant surprise. It is as slick as any Hollywood 'period' picture - I would actually have preferred a rougher edge to the visuals. But it is still pretty much Johnny Cash up there. Phoenix - one of our best young actors - captures the strangely offbeat yet hypnotic charisma that glowed out at the world from Cash's eyes, a charm that could seem alternately homespun and mysterious. Something burned in Cash's soul, and while he was completely honest about it, it still remains an enigma; Phoenix captures that as well.All the other actors do quite well; another special stand-out performance is by Robert Patrick as Ray Cah, Johnny's father. Gosh, I really hate this guy! Yet Patrick manages to avoid slipping into stereotype, so the last moment we see son and father together, it remains believable that somehow they came to terms with one another.The musical performances are all pretty good, although they don't quite meet the Cash standard. And the background performances by the people playing some of rock's greatest early legends (jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis, etc.) are somewhat uneven. But the show belongs to Phoenix, and he pulls it of very well.One note on the DVD release: it includes scenes cut from theatrical release. Usually I get bored with the 'deleted scenes' on DVDs because it's quite clear why they were deleted and ought to have been. In this instance, however, their deletion is completely baffling. Most are excellent, certainly as good as any in the released film, and some are even important in the way they tie certain ends together. I strongly suggest to the makers of this film that they restore these deletions for a second release, which would give a good film a new, perhaps improved, life in the theater.In any event, quite a good movie, and certainly an homage to Cash that invites audiences to listen to his music, and to (re)discover the legendary 'Man in Black'.",9,0,0,23 April 2007
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Defines bad movie in the post-modern era
","A Game of Shadows: In an era when our most popular films are really little more than roller-coaster rides through comic book worlds, can anyone actually make a bad film, with standards so low. Well - you can make this film, I guess. 'A Game of Shadows' is truly awful. I admit I even watched it twice, because the first time through I couldn't get any sense of what the story was all about. The second time around, a number of narrative threads did seems to run through the film, eventually tied together (rather arbitrarily) at the end. But I realized that the story (or stories) here merely form a kind of scarecrow on which director Ritchie could hang set-piece action sequences, camera tricks and CGI wizardry, while the actors mugged like children in a bad school play about someone or other they called 'Sherlock Holmes,' for no other reason than they had heard the name while running around a TV set with an old movie playing on it.Childishly campy, visually ugly (that mind-numbing slo-mo - stop it!), badly written, and horribly over-acted; of course it made millions. That doesn't stop it from being a bad film. Note: There are currently four series of films attempting to revise the canon of Conan Doyle's brilliant Victorian detective for the 21st Century. One from the UK (Sherlock, for TV), one from the US (Elementary, for TV), one from Russia (Sherlock Homes, for TV), and the internationally produced films of Guy Ritchie, starring Robert Downey. Notably, each involves a radical re-envisioning of the character and his place in the world. We may have reached a point in history when filmmakers simply cannot give us the Great Detective as he was imagined by Doyle and played (with variations) throughout the 20th Century. Rating the 4 series: Sherlock Holmes (Russia): 9 of 10, with strong stories and a believably proletarian nerd Holmes. Sherlock (UK): 6 of 10; excellent first season has been betrayed by Steven Moffat's flashy showmanship until the stories are incoherent now (Season 3), the characters no longer likable, the focus almost completely lost. Elementary (US): 4 of 10; the redefined Holmes, a nervous, unsympathetic recovering drug addict, is not without interest, and any show with Lucy Liu in it gets the benefit of her quiet but charismatic presence and talent. But basically, this is just a routine American police procedural with a gimmick. I doubt that Hollywood can do anything else. Sherlock Holmes (Ritchie/Downey): 1 of 10. This series lacks any coherence in its stories or continuity. It's just a series of set-pieces with running around, fist fights, explosions, and campy jokes.",1,8,14,4 March 2014
3:10 to Yuma," disappointing
","The original '3:10 to Yuma' was stagy and turgid at times, but it held its own as a parable for the '50s' effort to find the relationship between what we say we believe and what we are actually willing to live with.This version just doesn't come close. It has no sense of humor and the tone is unremittingly grim. The characters are unlikeable, so the actors are left with a thankless job, trying to keep us interested in people we'd rather not ever meet again. Mangold tries to put bite in the script by resorting to larger-than-life Western clichés, like the two-gun killer in the grey coat, and the young boy's 'surprising' (not) acts of heroism, but these only look anachronistic and out of touch with the film's excessive realism in design. Finally, the camera work is just dull, and the editing is a hatchet job, especially in the action sequences.This was touted as a resurrection of the Western genre, but I have no idea why. But the general feel of the film did remind me a little of the old 'Gunsmoke' TV show, which tended to get talky and dull; but 'Gunsmoke' did have a solid rock to stand on in the character of Sheriff Matt Dillon. That's who this movie needed, desperately. Unfortunately, he never arrived.",5,2,4,30 November 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," fun, but not
","This is one of the films that led me, slowly but surely, to loathe the work of George Lucas.To be sure, it is not a bad film - in fact, it succeeds in generating the same kind of excitement as the B-movie/serial action films of the 1930s, the formula for which it is intended to resurrect. But it is that resurrection itself that annoys me, for two reasons.First, Although the serials of the '30s were certainly a bit of daffy fun, they were just badly made. In order to enjoy them, one has to 'dumb down' quite a bit. In the early '70s revival of these films on the college circuit, this meant taking drugs before or during viewing. Without inebriates, it means adopting a child's perspective - and there is nothing wrong with that. The problem is, why insist on an expensive Hollywood production that requires the same 'dumbing down'? And do so in a manner so as to close off other, more mature approaches to the adventure film format? Secondly, the cultural references of the 1930s action B-movie were all outside of film itself - references to the political crises in Europe, to fears generated in the wake of the depression, to ennobling efforts to maintain American values against threats from within and without, to the rise of organized crime, to a developing technology no one fully understood at the time, and to increasing awareness of the strangeness of non-European cultures. A heady mix, and it's clear why Americans found the B-movie useful in sorting out and coping with so many different issues.But the cultural references in 'Raiders' are all to movies of the 1930s. In other words, there is NO world beyond the movie screen for Mr. Lucas. Even the myth of the 'Ark of the Covenant' has more to do with DeMille's 'Ten Commandments' than it does with the Ark as described in the Bible, since it is clearly intended to work magic, which is about as much of religion as DeMille really understood. And let's not even discuss the hopelessly card-board Nazis here.This 'dumbed down' inversion of cultural reference makes 'Raiders' feel claustrophobic and regressive more than any other film mining the same ore I can think of. To be sure, Spielberg gives the film a professional gloss and a sense of action Lucas' other films lack. And both Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are truly delightful to watch.So the film is certainly fun to watch - but it doesn't inspire any greater respect for writer-producer Lucas, one of the true con-men of modern cinema.",7,2,5,13 November 2007
Se7en," one of the best-made films of its era and genre
","Despite clichés, and a very depressing finale, this is one of the best-made films of its era and genre.The strengths of the film include an odd relationship between the two lead cops, who seem loosely based on the two lead cops of the 'Lethal Weapon' series, but who (thankfully) never play for laughs, and never really become 'buddies' - the young cop is too arrogant, and the older cop has too much experience, which the young cop refuses to acknowledge. The two characters are also brilliantly acted by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt (probably his best performance).There's one odd flaw in the film - about half-way through, I found that I had learned to 'expect the unexpected' from the film, which meant that the rest of the film was predictable in a bizarre way - simply decide where the expected move would be, and then expect the unexpected move instead. The most obvious instance of this is in the finale itself, which could be guessed at least 5 minutes ahead of time.Normally, this would be a formula for disaster - but fortunately, the high quality of the film-making twists the film into an edge-of-the-seat suspenseful waiting game as we watch with horror the one cop's encounter with the insanity of pure evil.I didn't want to admire this film (to be honest, I dislike Brad Pitt something fierce), but I'm afraid I must - very professionally made, it delivers its promised suspense all the way.",9,106,145,14 October 2007
Citizen Kane," necessary American film
","general statement of principle; I am sick to death of commercial filmmakers preying on the young by obscuring the fact that, as filmmakers, they have nothing original to say or do, by chewing up the past and spitting it out again with 'new, improved' special FX.yet, judging from some of the reviews i read here is that the sad fact is that many young viewers are not only ignorant of film history, they earnestly wish to remain ignorant.what could possibly be gained by a surrender to one's own ignorance. an ignorant man has to be told what to do and what to think. simply rejecting the advice of one's elders does not constitute freedom of thought - it is exactly when we reach a decision contrary to that of our peers that we discover what it may mean to become an individual.this means, of course, that statistical arguments concerning the uselessness of history are wholly unconvincing. to say that 'most people agree with me on this point' doesn't say that the point is well-made; possibly everyone in agreement with it is simply wrong.to assert one's independence and then turn around and say that the 'majority agree' is self-evidently contradictory. to abide by such statements despite evidence and reasonable disproof, is not simply exposing ignorance - which can be corrected through education - it is simply stupid.furthermore, since an ignorant person has to be told what to think, it follows that such a person is a victim waiting for a crime to happen. such people seem proud of their ability to thumb their noses at people who reach out to help - but they easily and quickly fall victim to con-artists, who usually know how to make such people feel good about the victimization.knowledge of history means; not getting scammed for want of it. it means deepening one's awareness of the strengths and faults of those we admire. it means that we learn the tricks used to produce something of value, thus making it easier to find and judge value.in film it is also well to bear in mind that good film-makers are precisely those who have studied film history the most. this gives them a stock of film-techniques developed by others on which to draw for increased effectiveness of their own films. i find it unclear, why it is young viewers of today wish to remain in ignorance of where the contemporary film-maker draws inspiration.this fact blasts away the commonly proffered assertion, 'we do things better now than anything they did 'back when'. if that were true, then the film-makers of today would not need such inspiration; but they do.finally, it is simply a fact that those who profess ignorance - as a desirable quality - have nothing new anyone might be able to learn. they always get basic facts wrong.citizen Kane is not about a 'newspaper editor' - to suggest so is merely to admit one's ignorance. Charles foster Kane is a 'media mogul' - as we would call him today - which means that he belongs to the 'upper ten percent' of the population that decides the future for the other 90 percent. he helps to reform politics in new york city; he intimidates a president into going to war with Spain. he gobbles up entertainment media in new york and los angeles, simply to give his wife a stage on which to sing.and - all of this is misguided. even his attempt at political reform fails because it has little to do with 'helping people' as he claims at first, and everything to do with his own ego and ambitions.one of the tell-tale signs of ignorance to be found in reviews of it is the harping reference on the 'rosebud' motif.the movie has nothing to do with rosebud - that's just a little joke on Welles' part.finally one has point out the tasteless ignorance of insisting that a film is weak because - heaven forbid - it's not in color. that's sort of like saying 'your father's a fag because he hasn't gotten your mom pregnant in years'. - it is wholly irrelevant to any movie whatsoever, to be sure, a director can handle color well - but he or she can handle black and white lighting and composition equally well.citizen Kane is one of the most innovative films in cinema history, and it has been used as such by filmmakers literally ever since its initial release. yet these innovations are still as striking as ever - from the use of convex glass reflection in the opening sequence, to the amazing tracking in and out of the fireplace at the end.if you care about film, you owe it to yourself to see the film; had it never been made, neither would any contemporary films that you enjoy today, or that you may enjoy tomorrow.and if that doesn't sink in - then, screw it - i've no patience for fools.still one of the best films in the history of cinema, and still a film necessary to see and appreciate.",10,5,9,1 August 2006
Memento," the most important English language film of the 21st century
","I write this after having to write a bad review of Nolan's 'batman Begins.' 'Memento'. after more than seven years, remains the most important English language film of the 21st century. Into it, Nolan pours all the fundamental problems of film, and the fundamental problems of memory that gave rise to film in the first place.It takes about four viewings to get any grip on this film - yet none of these viewings feel wasted in any way, as though the director has played tricks on us - on the contrary, it is the film's bald-face honesty which leaves us in despair of ever getting just the right handle on all the details and the characters.Its hard to understand how Nolan could have betrayed himself and his vision after this film, by selling out to Hollywood's highest bidders - hopefully, he'll recover and give us the Christopher Nolan film we should expect after seeing this one.But in any event, this remains one of the most important films ever made - brilliantly written, filmed, acted, edited - a necessary companion piece to Welles' 'Citizen Kane' or Eisenstein's 'Potemkin' - hopefully, Christopher Nolan will actually direct another film some day....",10,17,29,15 May 2007
12 Angry Men," The hope of democracy
","As brilliant a presentation of the arts of logic and conversation in a situation of severe stress as one can imagine. The dialog is razor sharp, the characters well-drawn, and director Lumet, cameraman Kaufman and editor Lerner have worked miracles with a cramped space that doesn't lose any sense of claustrophobia in the process. Although one can certainly take the message as having to do with inherent problems in having a death penalty as a rule of law, there is a deeper message still: does not justice, in a democratic society, demand of us to think clearly? to uncover and expunge our individual prejudices? to confront the enormous weight of responsibility as coolly and objectively as possible? If the answers to those questions must come up negative, then democracy is a false hope and we should abandon it and give ourselves over to the nearest group of elitists who can guaranty us bread and circuses.Right now, with a right-wing junta in power in Washington, many Americans seem satisfied with such a possible result; they seem to forget that the result would be the same under a left-wing junta as well. The hope of democracy is that government is neither left nor right, but every day, that it allows all of us some share in shaping our own destinies personally and collectively.'12 angry men' is thus a film filled with hope - hope for ourselves, each as individuals, but also hope for our future, our children and the possibilities they represent.If this hope is false, it is still certainly preferable to any of the lies spewed forth by the American media today.",10,2,4,4 September 2007
Public Enemies," May be greatest misfire in cinematic history - certainly for a gangster film.
","I like Michael Mann, and I like gangster movies; but the trailers on this were not inviting - flashy, slick, without a lot of tension. So I waited 'till the film got to the bargain theater. My pre-viewing apprehension proved to be spot on.While there are a number of really fine set-pieces here, I haven't seen a film so utterly lacking in focus or theme in a long time. The bare story of the real John Dillinger is strong enough to carry the viewer of the film, but did the audience not know at least something of that story, it would be hard to follow story here, it goes all over the place. And I am shocked that we get to know so few of the characters here - it takes a while to recognize one G-Man from another, even after they have become important to the narrative (such as it is).It's hard to figure out why Mann decided to go wild with the historical inaccuracy; I'll mention one I found most annoying, first because it is a seemingly small matter, but it also reflects two larger problems. I'm referring to the repeated use of Billie Holiday on the soundtrack - she's even on the radio whenever Dillinger turns it on - unfortunately, she wasn't known during the early Thirties, she was just starting out! It's clear someone wants to make a point by playing her that often - but I haven't got the foggiest idea what it is? Is Dillinger supposed to be a 'black white man' like they say of Bill Clinton? Is his career a foreshadow of Hollidays's? Couldn't they find any other period music to play? Which remarks the soundtrack itself, which is one of the worst in a major motion picture in recent years - it's a mess, evoking a dozen different emotions, almost none having anything to do with the images we're watching at the moment.The dialog is needlessly pretentious. One thing I feared was having to compare this film to John Milius' 'Dillinger' with Warren Oates - but the comparison can't be avoided. Milius, taking his cue from 'Bonnie And Clyde,' from the earlier Lawrence Tierney film 'Dillinger,' and from the gaudy gangster films of Roger Corman, fashioned a film that was both flashy yet homespun, part unabashed B-movie, part evocation of American Gothic. Milius' film is by far the better of the two. Even his occasional tinkering with historical accuracy could be forgiven, since it was clear he had a firm grasp on what the Dillinger phenomenon was really all about - 'farm boy makes good by turning bad' is an undeniable folk-theme of American life.But Mann clearly - and desperately - wants Dillinger to be a real hero, not only of his time but ours. This is the most romanticized version of Dillinger - of any American outlaw - I've ever seen, making the many cinematic apologies for Jesse James seem like harsh condemnations by comparison. But it can't be done. The brilliance of Warren Oates' performance in the Milius film is that Oates plays Dillinger like a runaway farm-boy with a sense of humor and a quick temper, who just happened to rob banks for a living. That's as much as you can give any professional criminal without lying about the nature of crime namely, it's about stealing other peoples' money and hurting many of them in the process. The cowardly punk Dillinger as performed by Lawrence Tierney is probably even closer to the truth. But the sum of all this is not simply that Mann has romanticized Dillinger; that, in a B-movie at least, could have been forgiven. The real problem is that he sentimentalizes the bandit. This turns the whole shenanigans soft like mush, instead of the hard-boiled crime film we should have gotten.And this leads into one of the worst finales in film history, dragging on and on, and even after we know the story is done - it still goes on, trying to turn itself into a tear-jerker! What a waste! And what a disappointment from Michael Mann. And don't blame the actors, as some critics have done - they're actually trying to do a good job - but the script is poor, and Mann can't think of any way to direct it properly.",2,3,5,31 October 2009
Oldboy," the second half is a betrayal
","This film starts out way cool and then suddenly becomes a mess.the problem is simple - the director wants us to feel as much sympathy for the abductor as the abducted. This is a bad decision and ruins the film.The abductor is a spoiled rich pervert. What do I care if he loved his sister or not? Once this sympathy thing starts, its all straight to the toilet.Really unfortunate - this film starts out as a brilliant, disturbing look at social isolation, and then becomes - what? For the life of me, I don't know, and couldn't care less.The film clearly begins as a comment on Korean politics of the past 20 years -n and then becomes sentimental/ existential slop - really cowardly (in writing this review, I realize I'm not just disappointed, I'm peed off - this should have been a great film, and Korea needs great films right now - instead I get some weird variant on American soap operas.) The first half deserves a 'ten'. it's truly brilliant - but the second half is such a betrayal, it drags the whole film to zero.To the writer-director: Get your hormones working and turn out the film this was supposed to be.",1,35,78,15 May 2007
Constantine," bloated, with a message from hell
","THis film is really an incredibly long advertisement against smoking cigarettes; but I found it wholly unconvincing, and am puffing away while I write this - delicious! Full-flavored - it satisfies! Which is more than this movie did.Don't get me wrong - I actually had some fun with this thing's mindless action sequences, which are rather well handled.But let's be honest: First. Stop spending tens of millions of bucks on comic books. There's way too much money spent on this film, and not enough to cover-up the fact that it is mere B-movie pot-boiler.And hey, if you're making a B-movie pot-boiler, than it ought to be slick and to the point, with as little dialog as needed. There's nothing more soporific than an over-long B-movie pretending to be 'deep' or arty or something.Finally. Although I recognize that the real fault for it lies with the audiences who admire such mush, I am sick and tired of Hollywood's blasphemous trashing of Christianity, all of which only reminds us - shamefully - that most Americans who claim to be Christian haven't the slightest clue as to what their religion is really all about, despite the fact that many are willing to kill Muslims in the name of a Christ they don't understand, and who must be utterly furious at such vicious mockery of all that he taught.Let's get one thing very clear - Christianity is NOT about any 'battle between good and evil' (that religion is Manicheism, a derivative of ancient Parsi). It is about redemption, mercy, charity, peace. If it isn't, then it has no more claim to our attention than professional wrestling.The morality of this film is essentially that of professional wrestling.And just as an afterthought, let's remark that, while the intentional comic relief of the film falls flat, the dramatic moments are just about funny as hell - and come from some writer residing there, no doubt.Like a highly polished remake of the old Italian Hercules movies, and just about as much fun for the same reasons.",4,1,4,14 October 2007
Troy," Is this the phase that lunched 1000 dips?
","The line 'Is this the face that launched a thousand ships?' is from Christopher Marlowe's Dr. Faustus, in reference to Helen, the wife of Greek King Menelaus, stolen off to Troy by the spoiled-brat prince Paris as desired reward for deciding that Aphrodite was a pretty good-looking Goddess. One would think that Marlowe's having entered this line into the history of English literature would be enough to preserve it for us, but apparently the makers of Troy felt we needed a reminder; so when Menelaus and his brother Agamemnon decide to sail in pursuit of Helen in this film, one of them just has to say 'We'll need a thousand ships!'There are about ten other lines of dialog in the whole movie, which the audience hears repeated by every major player in some form or other, but the one heard most often is 'my name will be remembered throughout history!' or it's 2nd person variant, 'Your name will be remembered throughout history!' Occasionally one even hears the 3rd person variant, 'His name will be remembered (etc.)!' I can no longer remember who actually says these lines in which order, because all the actors act the same, and perform the same actions, and maintain the same low-level of technical (im)perfection. I think somewhere in this film is Peter O'Toole (God forgive him!), and was that Brad Pitt pretending to be the fabled Achilles? No, I don't believe it, no producer would be that low!Somebody wrote somewhere that this film was based on Homer's Iliad; that's like suggesting that Disney intended to make a Mickey Mouse cartoon based on Hamlet: 'To hee hee hee or not to hee hee hee - whaddya think, Pluto? - Hee hee hee - down boy!'This film makes Hollywood the number one target for a terrorist suitcase bomb; but apparently their brains are so addled there, they probably wouldn't notice the explosion. My dog writes better dialog than anyone speaks in this film, just by banging on the keyboard at random with her paws. And did I mention the horrific 'acting'? Will someone please send Orlando Bloom to drama school before he gets any older? And if Brad Pitt wants to be the next TV Hercules, let him audition for that part, and leave these god-awful pseudo-epics alone.There was clearly a lot of dough spent on production of this film; well, fools and their money are soon parted; so a word to the wise: don't spend a penny to see this; remember what your mother told you about self-abuse - do it and you'll go blind.The gods look down, and puke.",1,5,14,4 July 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," PUKE - don't take your kids to this one! - better yet, stay away altogether
","I really liked the first Pirates movie. The second was so-so, but it was clearly a set up for the big finale, so I thought, let's expect the best.I have not seen a film this bad in a very long time. I kept thinking of the Liz Taylor 'Cleopatra' or Cimino's 'Heaven's Gate' - massive amounts of money flushed down the toilet (or snorted up someone's nose, which is more likely).The story starts out strong; the special effects are great. Some of the camera work is superb... but then, there's the dialog - Wretch wretch wretch! People do not speak this way - even video game characters do not speak this way! And not fun at all. And the idiotic CGI; and the terrible film-school student editing - And expecting the big finale? - turns out this is just a build-up to the sequel - What happens to Calypso? Where is the Fountain of Youth? Will what's-her-name and what's-his-face ever get it together in real life? And do I care? Will I ever care again? Absolutely NOT! No plastic cups, no posters, no toys, no nothing - Satan, get thee well behind me.And Mr. Depp and Mr. Rush - the two major talents wasted in this slop - shame on you.Finally, a word of warning - Disney Studios has the disgusting gall to market this as a kid's film - do NOT take any children to see this film - Extreme violence; gore; mishmashed paganism; (humorless) dirty jokes; implicit cunnilingus - this is the most wretched display of perverse adult cynicism I have ever seen - and they sell it to children?! Disney - SHAME! Damnation would be too gentle a curse for pedophilical necrophiles like thproducers of this trash. Walt, returneth and pour fire and brimstone on the heads of your betrayers!

Nacho Libre," always amusing
","I'm not a fan of Jack Black; to be honest, I thought 'School of Rock' to be pandering, absurd, and just a waste of time. And Black is one of those comic actors who's always essentially playing himself - his schtick is his personality and vice versa, a kind of comedy not to my taste.But in 'Nacho Libre' Black doesn't play Jack Black; and his basic lack of acting talent actually enhances the character.The film is not a satire of the wrestling business in Mexico but an offbeat comment on it. It helps to understand that professional wrestling in Mexico is (or at least for a long time was) a national passion, the low budget everyman's fantasy that made the difficult poverty of Mexico a little easier to bear. (It certainly helps to have seen a couple Santo movies.) I didn't feel it was racist - Mexico has grown up somewhat in the past twenty years, meaning that Mexicans have learned to smile at themselves on occasion, so I don't think they'll be offended by this film - it certainly doesn't demean them; on the contrary, despite the foolishness of the central characters, the film is really an odd, offhanded celebration of self-respect, which is the other quality the Mexicans have struggled to acquire, especially in confrontation with the bullyboy neighbor to the North. At worst, as far as real Mexicans are concerned, the film might be too silly to rate further consideration. It is certainly consistently ridiculous, which is actually a quality in its favor - there's no effort to drop suddenly back into reality anywhere here, it's a fantasy through and through.I don't think this is a great film, by any means; but I don't feel that watching it was a total waste of time. It is not laugh-out-loud funny, but it is certainly always amusing.",7,0,0,23 April 2007
Corpse Bride," What a waste!
","'Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice - wherefore art thou, Beetlejuice?' That's actually a line from the Saturday morning cartoon show spun off from the original Beetlejuice movie - which is among one of the hippest cartoon shows ever made. As an ongoing series, it was able to develop the Land of the Dead, which could only appear as a back-drop in the original film, as a complete alternate universe. And it took chances - Beetlejuice ate bugs and vomited and even farted a couple times, while his Goth Earthling friend expressed her contempt for the boringly routine lives of her parents. It was an exercise in bad-taste-as-comic-gestalt, and it was targeted to young people mature enough to get in on the joke.All of this is exactly what is lacking in 'The Corpse Bride'. Given an opportunity to recreate the Land of the dead as a completely realized world unto itself, one would expect Burton to really give us a world we should like to visit (even if we also want to sure to leave anytime we wanted). Instead, Deadland here is again treated as a back-drop. And the story that unfolds before it is harmlessly sentimentalized and neither scary nor funny.Two definitive moments: Johnny Depp's character, supposedly a chief protagonist in the film, is not very smart, not hip at all, and incredibly wishy-washy - a complete waste of the vocal talents of Mr Depp. Second, the film's villain - a lame, predictable stereotype - if you have seen a couple Disney cartoons made after WWII, you could probably write all of his lines without seeing this film.What a waste! And stop-motion being as difficult as it is, it's entirely incomprehensible why Burton would throw it all away on such a wholly mediocre story with such dull, unattractive characters.The really sad thing is, this is aimed at children - but not the young hipsters who enjoyed the Beetlejuice cartoon show, but the great unwashed of Middle America, where people still think evolution is a dangerous idea.I suppose that, for children, this is harmless enough - but who wants a harmless movie about the Land of the Dead from Tim Burton? What a waste!",4,4,12,26 August 2007
Top Secret!," it just doesn't stop - amusing us
","This is a genuinely amusing film from start to finish, and I think will ultimately be remembered as one of the best comedies of its era.There's no doubt that some material could be tighter; that much of the humor is topical and now somewhat outdated; that the film lacks an inner cohesion, and thus comes across as a series of skits in many respects.But lovers of comedy can forgive many of these faults - much of Fields is now outdated, Laurel and Hardy never showed concern for tight construction, the Three Stooges are frequently lacking in inner cohesion; yet they all made screamingly funny movies! All right, perhaps this isn't 'screamingly funny' - but it's dam'ed amusing, start to finish, and just feels good for being that. Even when not laughing, you will always find yourself smiling - that's worth about everything in these grim times.Needs a second and a third look - never stops.(Side note: Val Kilmer's first film - and he does his own singing!)",9,4,7,12 January 2008
The Matrix Revolutions," one cliché after another
","The strongest quality of the original 'Matrix' was its writing; none of the CGI or goofy political subversiveness or borrowed Asian mysticism would have patched very neatly to the dark, even ugly, 'cyberpunk' reality envisioned in the film had the script been any weaker. But the dialog actually drove the story, and without a lot of fancy words.Outside of the fact that the direction is a mess, and the characters no longer know what they're doing there (and neither do the actors) and the CGI has become self-indulgent bloat, the weakest part of this film is its writing. The dialog is just one cliché after another - any Star Wars fan could have written it. The story, which no longer depends on the dialog, but rather on the flatulent visuals, is part Hong Kong action film, part old fashioned war movie, and part Star Trek rehash. The whole cyberpunk angst that made the first film fascinating, has utterly disappeared: in fact an 'explanation' is provided (or rather hinted at) that all worlds are equally real - and equally false, since programmed by some intergalactic super race - a real cop-out.The ending of the film - I won't give it away, but it is neither as satisfying as that of 'Dark City' nor as amusing as that of 'Men in Black'.Further evidence that Hollywood producers have nothing better to do with their money but flush it down the toilet. And those willing to pay them money for this just end up wiping their bums.",1,15,29,1 July 2007
Wanted," no blockbuster here
","One of the more popular reviews on this movie at IMDb (by uniiq) remarks: 'As bullets curve, heads get punctured, hilarity ensues, and rats explode (peanut butter rocks, BTW), you'll smile besides yourself.' I'm sorry, did I miss something? Heads getting punctured is supposed to be hilarious? I love violent action films, and I enjoy 'black comedy;' but a good action film knows when to take itself seriously, and a good 'black comedy' knows that violence is painful, even when the events around it are absurd. Yes you can mix the two genres - 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' is a fine moment of this - but it requires a real delicacy.Which this movie hasn't got. The first third is an amusing look at a nerd who suddenly finds himself in a comic book world of professional assassins; the second third is simply unpleasant, the nerd's occasionally sadistic initiation into that world. The third act is high concept - 'James Bond in 'The Empire Strikes Back.'' And unfortunately the concept doesn't work. Towards the end, although we know exactly what's going on, the film has lost it's focus just as a film - that is, as a story cinematically told - and we end up not giving a dam'.Finally, there's the acting - the nerd is a wimp, the supporting characters get hammy or wooden, and the actors who actually know what acting is don't have anything much to do here - including Angelina Jolie, who is almost completely wasted (anybody who thinks this movie is 'sexy' obviously hasn't reached puberty).Not a total loss as a dumb action movie - but blockbuster? I think not.",3,15,31,14 February 2009
Duck Soup," parody of war
","A vicious attack that one hardly feels. Perhaps the purest satire is that which passes for something else. Although this film didn't do well at the box-office, I suspect this was mostly because, released at the bottom of the depression, it concerned issues most Americans chose to ignore - to their detriment: slightly more than a half-a-decade later, they were sending their boys to fight the war that Duck Soup would have warned them about, had they cared to listen to it.Other comedians could parody Hitler; only the Marxes could parody war (Duck Soup) and then swing around and, by parodying opera (Night at the Opera), remind us that the grand scheme of monsters doesn't amount to much compared to a sweet melody, a colorful dance, or the wink of a lover.Without ever performing a scene from Shakespeare, the Marx Bros. brought the Bard's humor up to date.",10,1,3,4 June 2006
Dreamgirls," it's about the music - and unfortunately the music sucks
","This is a Broadway musical brought to film, and never rises above that gestalt. That is, if you like the Broadway of its era (and frankly, I don't), you'll like this movie; but if you're looking for a great film, what you have here is basically just an expanded recording of the play.That in itself doesn't sink th film - Chicago was also merely a recording of the Broadway production, really, but I admit the production itself was strong enough to pull that off.But here the problem is unavoidable - great performances, strong characters, interesting story, solid work behind the camera - and the most boring music to spew off a Broadway stage in many a year.If thy were going to do a compressed fantasy history of '60s soul, why did they not get the original music? This stuff is an embarrassing Broadway version of the mediocre soul of the 1970s. Where is the chunk, the drive, the wickedly seductive melodies that made '60s soul popular enough to build legends? At some points in this movie, I expected Spinal Tap to step out and take a bow.With some of the worst songs cut, I could recommend this, but not as it stands now.",6,2,3,15 November 2008
Quantum of Solace," pretty good B-movie
","To read through the reviews here, this film appears to have entered 'love it or hate it' territory, and that doesn't make sense. While this film is not as good as Casino Royale, it's still a good action film in the contemporary espionage genre.Dispelling one common complaint: Some critics remark that that the editing in the action sequences borrows too much from Hong Kong or even MTV. That's not true. The editing style chosen for this film is a taken from 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service,' complete with sudden close-ups and reflections from metal surfaces. Related Complaint: Too much/too little action. Actually the issue is overall pacing; Foster determined to keep the pace moving from one scene to another rapidly, not allowing for any moments of leisure or reflection. When there is so much action, any one action set-piece loses some of it's thrill, since it's no longer unexpected.Common Complaint 2: The plot is shot with holes. This is not entirely true, though understandable. What has actually happened is that the script underplays the plot and director Foster hasn't come up with a visually striking way to emphasize the plot elements so underplayed.Common Complaint 3: There's no humor to this Bond (for instance, no Bond quips). Actually there is, but Daniel Craig makes no effort to draw attention to it, usually speaking his 'quip' lines in a natural tone of voice, i.e., without the emphasis previous Bonds brought to them. Related Complaint: Too serious! Maybe, but the producers realized that Casino Royale left some issues to be resolved before they can open up the character to innovation that could make it more 'light-hearted.'Common complaint 4: There are no Bond gadgets in this film. True; however, the repeated insertions in the film of the computer programs used by the British Secret Service tell us why - the era of the 'Bond gadget' (despite micro-technology still 'hardware') was late industrialism, such innovations would leave little impression in the AI/software era of our day.Complaints aside, this is a pretty good B-movie, and it is certainly a James Bond movie - the core of the Bond legend has been re-interpreted for the 21st Century, but remains intact. The camera work is excellent, and there are moments that may unsettle some (like the opera sequence) but that still add to the substance of the film; and although the plot is a bit muddled, Foster and company have really made the film about Bond and so preserve an inner sense of continuity. Frankly, after Casino Royale, I'm not sure where else they could have gone. The next film will be the one that determines the future for this franchise.",7,1,4,14 December 2008
Independence Day," Does any of this film really matter?
","A way-overblown remake of the George Pal 'War of the Worlds', this is one of the last of the great 'so bad it's funny movies', this film had me laughing out loud in the theater - along with the rest of the audience.When Tim Burton made his tribute to bad cinema, Mars Attacks! - well, he shouldn't have bothered. Actually, sad to report, Mars Attacks! isn't very funny - but Independence Day surely is.The wretched dialog! the ridiculously stereotyped 'heros'! the chintzy special effects! the story that just wanders through every sci-fi stock situation looking for more clichés to spew at the audience! The silly aliens, who are never given any opportunity to really explain what they want from our miserable little planet in the first place! They just want us 'to die' - that's it their whole rational? 'hey, what do you wanna do today, Szqg?' - 'I dunno, waddayawanna do, Plkkr?' - Why don't we drop down to earth and kill the whole human race?' - 'Sure, why not? You bring the booze. But remember, me old lady wants me home by midnight.' - 'Earth time or Wqhdrf time?' - 'Does it matter?' Well, does it matter? Does any of this film really matter? Heck no! and that's about the only polite thing one can really say about it.",1,8,15,1 July 2007
No Country for Old Men," brilliant but confusing
","A very difficult film; the Coens spend more than ninety minutes setting up an exquisitely made genre film and then, in the final 15 minutes suddenly twist the film into a meditation on the essential amorality - and inevitable fatalism (in every sense) - of chance. This means that it is easy to discuss the first 3 quarters of the film without spoiling the ending - but the ending seems utterly disjoint from the rest of the film, despite the fact that the narrative remains firmly in place, and the ending really is one possible set of results from the larger part of the film. So the story is certainly well structured - but nothing in the main action of the film prepares for any of the events of the end. The film is brilliantly made; but this almost experimental, uncompromising insistence on uncertainty leaves me more confused than morally challenged.",8,2,5,22 March 2008
Mamma Mia!," could it get any worse?
","I suppose some women will find the film wonderful; so it's risky for a guy to point out how really BAD a movie this is. Also, many will find the movie charming for what for me was the main reason for walking out on it half way through - the music of ABBA, the aural equivalent of having someone scrape your face with frozen moose do.But the whole film is as vapid and silly as the music's lyrics. First, there's never any story development, just one empty and embarrassing song after another. Then there's the god-awful 'choreography' - the worst of it was the line-up of young men doing god-knows-what kind of muscle beach posing wearing floppy swimming fins - pure (unintentional) self-parody, it was straight out of Monty Python.The final nail in the coffin is the acting - there's so much ham on the screen, Jews and Muslims are committing sin watching this film. Meryl Streep is particularly embarrassing - only William Shatner mugs this bad, and he does it professionally, it's what people pay him to do. Is that what they paid Streep to do? Then she should refund their money, but she does about ruins her reputation as an actress with this one. She here looks like nothing more than a drag queen Tallulah Bankhead. I mean she was PATHETICALLY amateurish - which I suppose fits in with the rest of the amateurish display of rotten ham here.Oh, but let's not forget the dumb blonde daughter at the center of the - ahem, 'story'? Anyway, I almost forgave the actress doing a terrible job performing her, since she is THE most ANNOYING adolescent character ever devised for motion pictures. You almost got to feel sorry for the poor slob marrying her - except that he is the second most ANNOYING adolescent character devised for motion pictures.But of course, there's the music - as sterile and puerile as I remember it from the early eighties, the soundtrack for the Reagan era that finally gave us Bush II hell - slightly 'updated' (slowed down) to appeal to (what else?) aging ABBA fans - aging 'valley girls' with an inheritance and the personality-dysfunctional males who married them in order to avoid working for a living, like John McCain. His favorite song 'Dancing Queen' is presented in all its empty-headed insultingly self-satisfied narcissistic glory, replete with aging ingénues pretending to be young.And despite its rapid song-to-song pace, the film is PAINFULLY DULL - with neither plot development nor character development, what is it we're to be interested in, anyway? An absolute insult to any one who loves music or musicals or film. The worst film of the year - perhaps of th next half-century.",1,8,15,20 December 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," psychological study/ poetic docudrama
","As other admirers of this film have noted, the majority of those voicing complaint against this film are blaming it for being a bad Western, when in fact it isn't a Western at all. It is an elegiac domestic tragedy, a folk-narrative, a 'docudrama,'a psychological study of rural petty criminals and the myths they would like to perpetuate about themselves to avoid the pettiness of their lives. But it is not a Western. It has more in common with the old Robert Mitchum film about post-WWII moonshiners, 'Thunder Road,' than with 'I shot Jesse James.' But of course, unlike 'Thunder Road,' intended to appeal to younger drive-in theater audiences, the present Jesse James film is a straight drama intended for a mature audience. So the other complaint against the film, that it is very slow, is somewhat justified, but misses the point. This is not an action/ adventure film. I have no problem with those who do not like elegiac drams, but those who express disappointment that this is not a Western or an action film are simply off base. Why not complain that 'The Dark Knight' is not a successful romantic comedy? This would make as much sense.Taken on its own terms, the film, despite its length, is sometimes painfully suspenseful, even knowing the story ahead of time, because what we are really watching are convolutions of character, where every real action, every word spoken or misspoken reveals a little more of the psychology and personalities of the characters. Also, there's no doubt the off-screen narration repeatedly hints that there might be a moral center to be found in the world of James and Bob Ford - but none exists. We certainly have some sense of what is wrong when we see it happen, but no real guide as to what is right.The narration of the film frequently achieves real poetry. The dialog is at once folksy and crisp. The acting is uniformly brilliant, even from Mr. Pitt, of whom I am no fan. The editing could be tighter in spots, but is frequently on target, given the quirky pacing of the story. The cinematography includes some of the most beautiful outdoor cinematography I've seen in many years. It's a sad story, but worthy of attention and praise. And no it's not a Western. But its a dam' good movie.",10,3,6,5 January 2009
Batman Begins," Mr. Nolan, do you remember making movies?
","The first half of this film is pretty good. The Tibetan Monastary scene is a rip from the Baldwin 'Shadow' movie of 1994; but that was probably a rip from another film, so, what the hey. The second half of the film is pretty much of a redoing of elements from the first Tim Burton Batman film, and it really never lived up to the promise of the first half. The first half almost finds the real human beneath the Caped Crusader's cowl - an almost impossible feat, for any comic book movie, but Nolan nearly pulls it off. The second half, although a well-made action story, never gets back to this level of insight.But here's the real problem: Director Christopher Nolan made what is unquestionably, to my mind, the finest English language film yet made in the 21st century, 'Memento'. what the hell is he doing directing cartoons? Well, he made a lot of money and moved to Hollywood; that'll do it, I guess.On the DVD of 'Memento' there's a special feature interview with Nolan, in which he says that he much preferred looking through the camera lens while filming, to using a video recorder for instant playback. Given all the CGI in this bloated comic book movie, one could never imagine it made by the same director.Well, Chris? What happened? And when are you going to make a real film again? I'm sick of Hollywood buying out people of talent and turning them into 'blockbuster' fodder.Nolan, get real.",7,1,2,22 April 2007
Twilight," Marketing research or film?
","This film is a brilliant example of market research, a product that is perfectly crafted for its target audience, middle-class females ages 12-16. And I sincerely mean that. I know of few films that have so captured the romantic angst of early feminine puberty, and have done so in a pop-cultural idiom touching - at least lightly - on all the hip romantic fads this age group inherits from its parents and elder siblings, from 'goth' to 'Native American spirituality.' It also references much more violent films of the 'vampire' genre without ever betraying its softly shaded early-teen 'sensitiveness.' But good marketing does not necessarily make good film. If you like this film and you are not a middle-class female aged 12-16, you really need to ask yourself why you want to be a middle-class female aged 12-16, because such is the only audience that would not be appalled by this extremely long, drawn-out, soap-operatic 'Dark Shadows' style inversion of the old Archie comics.Some other reviewer wrote that he didn't see the 'so bad it's funny' elements of the film. Please, sir, understand that the very idea of vampires playing baseball is inherently grotesque, and amusing for that reason - it's amazing Mel Brooks didn't come up with the idea for 'Dead - and Loving It.' Also, the repeated references to the scent of the heroine driving vampires wild had my friends and me telling feminine hygiene jokes for a good half-hour - deservedly so, since the market research that went into this film is clearly manifested here in the not so subtle reference to the body odors young girls become acutely aware of as they enter their menses. And the first indication that the film is soon to become a trash classic is the very appearance of the vampire hero. Bad enough that the actor was chosen because he looks like an 'emo' cross between an anorexic Joaquin Phoenix and a James Dean suffering manic-depression. But then there's that HAIR! It's precisely the kind of cut young girls think guys should wear.The point being: the situations, the dialog, the very appearance of the film, although all well-crafted to sell to a target audience, make the film hilariously bad when it doesn't simply just drag (which it does quite a bit).All this sounds like I'm trashing the intended audience of this film as much as the film itself. Not necessarily. When I was very young, I really thought the comedies of Don Knotts (e.g., 'The Incredible Mr. Limpet') were utterly charming. Although some films I liked as a child I still find amusing (e.g., Three Stooges shorts), I got over my tolerance for Don Knotts by the age of 14. Had his films been worth seeing for someone younger than ten? Sure. Were they utterly atrocious cinematic sludge? You bet. Back in the '60s, 'New Critics' of various arts convinced us that we had to like great art - which also meant, inversely, that we had to defend entertainment we enjoyed as great art. That simply isn't so. If you're a middle-class female aged 12-16, enjoy this feast, it was prepared for you. As you mature you may yet develop more enlightened tastes - the Cullen family did, after all.",1,10,13,22 March 2009
Hero," a great dramatic film
","most of the reviews of this film referring to its politics, that i've read so far, have failed to see it in what once was called 'a world-historical perspective'. first, it should be pointed out that all films by Chinese - including those made in hong Kong, Taiwan, and even in the west - avoid direct presentation of domestic political issues. i don't know why, and it's too broad a topic to discuss here. but i mention it because when a Chinese film reflects Chinese politics in a strong way, even if indirectly, we should definitely pay attention and give it a chance.secondly, i remind the reader that during the 20th century c.e., the Chinese suffered through two major revolutions, two civil wars, and two world wars, not to mention the chaos of the gang of four's 'cultural revolution' and the disaster in tianaman square.throughout this period the Chinese experimented with a different governmental and economic structure with each of these bloody affairs, tampering with democracy, fascism, socialism, Marxist-socialism, Stalinist-Marxist socialism, 'back-to-the-farm' cadre organizations similar to the kibbutzim of Israel, and western style capitalism. no other highly populated nation in the world has suffered through so many violent changes in so short a time - ever.'hero' is a film about forgiveness. the Chinese will never progress if they simply dismiss the revolution of '49 as a big mistake; nor can they continue to follow Maoist state-socialism. if they make tianamen square a critical political issue, they could end up back in civil war; but no one in china is likely to forget it.so what else can they do, but to admit that everyone was wrong, and everyone was right. few Chinese participated in these violent crises in order to turn a profit - i.e., the instigators of all these violent moments hoped to produce good - and usually did, if only in a small way. if the Chinese can forgive each other of their own past, they will certainly produce the world's next super-power - and they know it. and that's what this film is about.the cinematography is beautiful; the editing may seem a little leisurely, but i found it graceful. the acting is highly impressive, and the actors have a fine script with sparse dialog to work with. the story is moving and elegiac, but never 'sad'. it is, after all, a movie about hope.as for jet Li fans - well, this is not a 'jet Li action movie'. this is just a great dramatic film that happens to star jet Li - and does a great job with it.see this without preconceptions; and i am not saying forget the politics - i'm saying, think about it.that's what a great dramatic film is supposed to do - get us to think about it.",10,3,5,29 August 2006
Patton," two-thirds a great war movie
","my father was wounded in a parachute drop during the battle of the bulge. three quarters of that troop did not survive. George s. Patton probably saved my father's life, and certainly the lives of those trapped in bastogne.when i was a child i thought 'Sgt. york' the best thing that ever happened on film. it wasn't until i was about twenty-five that i realized it was a crack-pot's wet dream, and a poor apology for the incarceration and out-right murder of pacifists during world-war-one - which was an aristocrat's war the u.s. should never have fought.Patton was right that there was little difference between the Nazis and the republican party. the current demonization of pacifists by the republican-controlled media is proof enough of this.this film is two thirds of the greatest war movie ever made in America, because Patton is a complex character presented with impossible chores, most of which he actually accomplishes, and with real chutzpah. and an American chutzpah, i should point out. for all his dandy-isms, he was a nose-to-the-grind-stone servant of his army and its national mission.the film is magnificently photographed, and dramatically remarkable from the opening speech, all the way up until - the battle of the bulge. before this moment, Patton is wide open to all the cutting criticism that the writers' quietly embed in their script.but in the battle of the bulge, Patton proved that he could be a solid tactician; that he well understood the suffering - and the potential - of his men; that his grasp on the inter-relationship between tactic and strategy was as strong as he always claimed; that his swift interventions, as bloody as they seemed, actually reduced the casualty-cost of battle; and that he actually knew what he was talking about in his poetic ramblings on history.this doesn't make him a great man - but he certainly was a great general.once presented with this fact, the writers of the movie lose control of their character and their film, and the director - who should be the one to recognize this and salvage it - fumbles about along with them.too bad. as it is, George c. Scott's performance is rightly legendary, and saves the film from its crumbling finale. this remains his golden moment - and to the extent that he performs George s. Patton exactly as he ought to be played - and he does, - this remains not only Scott's shining moment, but one of the great performances of film history.",9,8,16,11 August 2006
Million Dollar Baby," Best cliché you'll see for sometime
","This film has received criticism for its use of clichés; and the clichés are here, and they are plentiful. But the production, direction, and acting breathe life into them to the extent that most of them are unnoticeable, and a few are even welcome. Morgan Freeman's character is pure formula, but to the extent that he is an excellent actor, who cares? and to the extent that this IS a 'boxing' movie, where would it be without such a retired 'old-school' boxer (punched-out eye and all) to comment on the nature of the sport? The fact is, the construction is so well-done that it is hard not to watch the film all the way through. And the main characters are, on the whole, very likable; we care about them.A well-made, memorable presentation, even if we have seen these elements before.",8,2,3,23 September 2005
Donnie Brasco," elegy for a hit-man
","This film was critically well-received when first released, and almost developed a cult following. But it had two historical problems going for it - it reminded too many people of 'The Goodfellas' and 'Reservoir Dogs'. (In the DVD add-on featurette, they admit that production on the film was held up out of fear of comparisons with 'Goodfellas'.) As to comparisons with 'Goodfellas': I think Donnie Brasco works well as a complimentary film to Scorcese's undeniable powerhouse mob film. Since both are true stories, I have a suspicion that many of the characters in the two films are based on the same real people, so we get to see them from two different perspectives.As to comparisons with 'Reservoir Dogs': It is well to remember that Tarantino's film is itself derivative of Ringo Lam's 'City on Fire'. In fact, the 'undercover cop in the mob' film has become almost a separate genre in Hong Kong, the most recent hit in the tradition being 'Infernal Affairs', remade by Scorcese as 'The Departed'; the point being that Hong Kong pretty much set the bench-mark for this type of film, and so American films working the same material can't help but use elements originally developed by the Chinese.As to the film itself: It relies very heavily on the performances of Depp and Pacino, and fortunately, they are brilliant. The final conversation between their characters is tense because Pacino plays it so straight, and his character talks in such clipped, abbreviated sentences, we can no longer read him any better than Depp's character can. (A lot of the film's tension derives from the announced fact that when the mob decides to give you a bullet-ridden retirement, it always sends your best friend to do it.) There are weaknesses in the film, principally in the script. the narrative threads leading to certain events are left unclear and unresolved; and certain connections screaming to be made are left unnoticed.But Depp and Pacino are a winning team, largely because they operate with the same idea of what it means to develop character as an actor. We know they're them, so to speak, Depp and Pacino; but they're also equally Donnie and Lefty.A tense, occasionally amusing, and ultimately very sad elegy for an over-the-hill hit-man with no cards left to play.",9,4,6,25 May 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's genre film
","After long threatening to make a pure genre film - a film the plot and episodes of which are constructed by genre convention, and always secondary to the enjoyment of the action - Tarantino has produced a quirky but faced-paced homage to the Chinese and Japanese martial arts films of the 1970s (and some of their American clones as well).There's certainly no denying that the action sequences are rapidly paced, and professionally shot and edited. The story is loose and a little hackneyed, but that's exactly what a genre-film plot ought to be, since it is really just an excuse for the action. So of course the dialog is riddled with cliché; that also is as it should be.I suppose most of this will be missed by those unfamiliar with the '70s martial arts film; but they may be able to enjoy it as just an irony-laden action film of the current era.At any rate, anyone who thought the Chiba Street-Fighter films fun stuff, or who harbored a secret passion for TNT Jackson, will certainly enjoy this film.The one weakness is Uma Thurman. She was well-cast in Pulp Fiction, but I haven's seen anything with her that I've liked since. Here, she is just way too 'over the top' for this kind of film. The martial arts hero has to be cool unless really really angry - but Thurman has her rage-meter pushed to the max from beginning to the end of this film, and it gets awful tiresome after a while. Wish they had brought over Sue Shiomi for this one.Finally, a word about the sequel, Kill Bill II; and the word is BAD.

","The bottom line of the Toho Godzilla movies is - you have a guy in a rubber monster suit.The bottom line of the comic book action movie is - you have a guy wearing funny-colored tights.This is not a bad B-movie. The performances are strong throughout. The cinematography is professional, if not exceptional. Although the story is drawn out, the pacing is good. The dialog is to the point, the story is strong for what it is. I caught and understood the commentary on our current political state of affairs.But at the center of all this is a guy wearing purple tights. That makes it a B-movie, sorry.Adults do not go around wearing purple tights. Good A-list films are about adults. Get over it and grow up.Enjoy this for what it is, but don't make of it anything more.",7,3,9,6 January 2009
Toy Story," the cynical and the dead
","I found this amusing for about no minutes whatsoever.The movie has 'franchise' written all over it. Are we ready for the dolls? The Burger King cups? Heck, yes, obviously - let's reduce all imagination to cheap commodities, sell our children on an open market and let business ethics only apply.The 'story' is soporific, the dialog cliché, the characters banal, the message simpering wimpy crap only suited for a sado-masochist on a hangover.Gaudy bit of CGI fluff pretending to be a 'children's classic' - only in the dreams of the cynical and the dead.",1,15,90,1 July 2007
Men in Black," Tommy Lee Jones' finest hour and a half
","'Three Burials' not withstanding, this is certainly Tommy Lee Jones' finest performance in mainstream cinema, even including his psychotic brilliance in 'Under Siege'.The film is funny and well-made; still I can't help wondering about the film it could have been if director Barry Sonnenfeld hadn't been so fascinated with special effects (his commentary on the DVD is just about worthless).But Jones has a charm that reminds one of early Henry Fonda - all innocence despite experience, and supremely American in the best sense - plain, honest, determined.What a weird film for Jones' talent to shine through! But that grows from his inner strength - he makes this film, not the other way around.(Too bad he felt no such urge in the horrendous sequel, MIB II. But Hollywood sequels are what they are, and that would be another review.)",8,1,1,4 June 2006
Once Upon a Time in America," What film are we looking at?
","I suppose this should go to a bulletin board - but given some of the reviews I've seen, I think this needs to be emphasized again.I am not going to rate this film - or even comment on it, directly. Leone's fans will understand as I go on.As we all should know (but it is quite clear from reviews that many do not know) Leone planned a film some 250 minutes long; the original version of this film ran 239 minutes; it was then cut down to about 120 minutes (hey, that's nearly half the movie!) and it was restored - well, unfortunately, that's part of the story.This film appeared on broadcast television twice in - supposedly - two different forms, the 120 minute version and a 'restored' version, which later showed up on cable TV.Well, I saw them both, and I originally saw the 120 min. theatrical version, and all three versions were the same. The supposed 'restored version' that got shown the second time on broadcast TV had exactly 45 minutes more - of commercials. (To be fair, I think there was actually 5 minutes more of film.) Does anybody else remember that? shown on two or three nights? Yeah, - more commercials (I believe it was on ABC). Worse yet, the TV version hit the VHS rental stores as the 'restored' version first - and some rental stores still rent it out as such.The 'original' American release of this film is wretched. Characters in the 2nd half of the film talk as if they were introduced in the 1st half, only we never saw them. Events are alluded to that never occurred. And the chronologically linear presentations of the sequences actually makes the story difficult to follow since the transitions from scene to scene are abrupt and unprepared for.I don't know when I gave up hoping to find and see the original film. Eventually, I know I'll bump into it. But, until then....My remarks here are for those who think they may have seen a 'restored' version, but didn't.No, actually, my remarks are for those claiming to have any right to present this movie to the public. The original American release version should be destroyed; the original TV broadcast version should be destroyed; the 'restored' TV broadcast version should be destroyed; the 'restored' VHS version should be destroyed.Get the director's cut done and - burn all previous versions!",Null,0,1,25 June 2006
The Last Samurai," The film television actually did better
","There's nothing wrong about this film - except pretty much everything. I.e., the film is fairly well directed, with enough money in production to give it a good look. The problem is that it is poorly thought-through, miscast, and politically and historically ill-conceived.Actually, a much better story along similar lines was produced years ago on American television: 'Shogun', with Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune. That pains me to say. While I love Toshiro Mifune (hard to dislike, really), I hated Chamberlain and thought 'Shogun' one of the more boring episodes in American TV history. But, dammit, the writers of that 'mini-series' actually did their homework and got it right! Anyone familiar with Japanese culture had to give them the grudging respect that they had neither 'Westernized' it nor subverted it.Alas, the same cannot be claimed for 'The Last Samurai'. Watanabe, at 6'2', and with the most pale skin and bland features of any Japanese actor I can recall, is as about as typical of 19th Century samurai as his co-lead, Tom Cruise, who is as typical of 19th Century Americans as, say, Michael Jackson. Both over-emote embarrassingly. In America, this is as forgettable as Kevin Costner, but in Japan it's virtually criminal.The rest of the actors all do fairly well. The depictions of life in a Japanese farming village are not insulting - they're just out of place. Samurai lived in the manor, they had little to do with the farmers supporting them. The battle scenes are very well choreographed, but utterly detached; I felt I was watching a soccer match between two teams I didn't care for. AS for the politics - did the producers, director, et all., not realize that the writers had essentially written apology for the eventual rise of the Tojo junta, which invaded China (to the tune of 36 million dead), and bombed Pearl Harbor? Not even right-wing novelist (and leader of a failed coup) Yukio Mishma had that audacity! To the Japanese right, Tojo was an embarrassment, to the left a shame. In fact he himself, converted to Christianity just prior to his hanging, hoped he wouldn't burn in hell; but no other Earthling agreed with that hope, even the Emperor condemned him. To be fair, probably even the writers of this distasteful script did not know what they were doing. Neither did the film's investors. or they would never have sunk so much money into such a shoddy script.See 'Shogun' instead - or, better, rent some films by Kurosawa or Mizoguchi. (Actually, even some early Godzilla movies would be more representative.... Japan has a great culture; Tom Cruise is a bad actor; do the math yourself.)_",3,2,4,5 July 2005
Where Eagles Dare," the only one not in on the joke is the script-writer
","Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood play this movie as a parody without jokes, and that's the spirit in which to see it. As a war movie, a spy movie, a kind of WWII 'Mission Impossible' film - its utterly doomed by its own absurdity and the pretentiousness of the dialog. But as an overblown action film comedy (without jokes), it's a hoot - and a classic on that basis.There's one scene where Eastwood kills about fifty German soldiers on a staircase with one machine-gun - without reloading. And without sweating, or blinking, or breathing hard. Pure comic book book. If you don't take the film on that level, you'll be wasting your time.I think of this on about the same level as the Adam West 'Batman: the Movie', and enjoy it for very similar reasons. If you recognize that the only one not in on the joke is the script-writer, you will too.",7,4,10,19 May 2007
From Hell," Murder by Decree
","Once again, Hollywood tries to pretend that the past never happened.Although uncredited, this film is a direct remake of a Sherlock Holmes film from 1979, 'Murder by Decree', starring Christopher Plummer as Holmes. Even some of the camera set-ups and editing are the same.'From Hell' adds more sex and a little more gore; also, its ending is depressingly negative.However, the original 'Decree' was also pretty darn depressing. The detective, however brilliant, cannot move the mountains of society through the practice of reason and civility. The rich and the powerful, sick as they are, have some ability to reconstruct the world according to their own psychoses.No doubt. That was why the Plummer-Holmes film is not well remembered, and it is one of the elements in the present film that makes it, too, difficult to watch.'From Hell', though depressing, is well made; the acting is solid; the mystery elements are handled well - although in place of Holmes' deductive powers, the case is solved more through some kind of magic or ESP (this was very unclear to me). Overall, the level of suspense keeping us watching is maintained.But I confess I am weary that we get these regurgitations presented to us as though they were brand new. In an era when the Government threatens to arrest working-class kids for downloading mp3s, the rich and the powerful seem to be able to bootleg and plagiarize all they choose.Dam' depressing, indeed.",7,3,4,15 November 2006
The Happening," parable on love
","Director Shyamalan is the most Christian of all popular directors working in Hollywod, and the most thoughtfully Christian in Hollywod's history. Even though I'm not a Christian, I respect his thoughtfulness and faith.This not a horror film but a kind of post-modern 'Pilgrim's Progress' parable. The difficult question of the film is not 'what is happening?' but rather, why are the lead characters innocent enough to survive it? And the answer is rather odd and rather bold. Although recently married, they are still in the process of 'falling in love.' That's important because in a truly Christian universe, love is a practice, not a feeling. 'Feeling' love or 'being in love' does not redeem, only the active process of it.Is Shyamalan successful in portraying this? No; and the effort to do so actually requires considerable maturity, more than Shyamalan has right now. By the time John Ford was able it pull it off in 'the Quiet man,' he had some 25 years film-making experience, and had lived an adventurous life.But I am willing to give Shyamalan points for effort here. Constructing a parable of this sort in this time and place took considerable nerve. Hopefully the commercial failure of this film will not deter him from continuing to take such risks. Thoughtful films are hard to come by these days.So it's an admittedly weak film - parables lend themselves to beautiful visuals, but not to great acting, and the best dialog is on the theme and not the plot. But its reputation will grow in time, as Shyamalan's reputation grows and his handling of such themes matures.Oh, a last word - on the violence depicted in the film. It actually has to be taken with a tablespoon of salt. Much of it involves a student filmmaker's conceit, indicating Shyamalan is still concerned with learning his craft. But, to put it bluntly, much of the violent acts are insiders' jokes - 'it's raining construction workers,' get it? and the guy feeding his arm to the lions is a nod back to - Monty Python. Further indication that we are dealing with a parable on a theme rather than a well-constructed plot.Hopefully in the future, Shyamalan will learn, as John Ford learned, how to marry the two.",7,2,5,15 November 2008
It's a Wonderful Life," slush
","I like a lot of director Capra's films - but not this one.This is among one of the most vile floods of slush ever to be photographed. The characters are simpering when they aren't whining. James Stewart give us the worst, most over-wrought performance of his career - high-school student do better. The camera work looks expensive - and dull. The editing is perfunctory. There's no effort to use film to tell the story.The story itself is a banal rip-off from 'The Christmas Carol' - but the worst part of it is that Stewart's character spends his every moment visiting the 'alternate universe' (that would have happened had he never been born) trying to convince everyone that he really was born, and there is no 'alternate universe' - which makes no sense whatsoever, and completely blows any chance at insightful or revelatory alternate character development, and reduces his final submission to fate to a rather cheap, histrionic 'gee, I'm sorry; let's try it again, OK?' The raw cynicism that went into the making of this film - kept alive by generations of movie-reviewers as a kind of shared in-joke ('hey, let's face it, most Amereicans are just dumb' - would be frightening if it hadn't sold so well - which is the really scaring thing about it.",1,42,106,1 July 2007
Psycho," a brilliant puzzle game
","*SPOILER* 'Psycho' is something of a puzzle game, like the '3 dimensional chess' played in the old Star Trek TV show. When we think the film is moving in one direction, we find it has caught us up from behind on another level.On one level, the film is about guilt, but not in any way most people think about it. Janet Liegh's hapless victim is actually guilty of a number of old-fashioned sins - illicit sex, theft, lying, sloth, waste, hubris and self-obsession, all of which is soon to be discovered (after the film's end) when her car is dragged from the swamp revealing the stolen money in the trunk along with her body. Of course, the audience knows that she would have repented, had she lived, but nobody in the film will.Anthony Perkins' character, on the other hand, is guilty of - nothing. That's right, not a thing, nada, zip. That's because he's crazy: even his voyeurism is merely a manifestation of his psychosis. This is not simply a rule of Anglo-American law, by the way - it dates back at least to St. Augustine's Civitas Dei and his definitive statement that where the will is absent, there can be no guilt. And one cannot have will when the mind is so wholly disordered, it can no longer discern a choice to be made (that part is Aquinas).Perkins' psychopath thus becomes mere act of nature to the people he kills. If Leigh's character had decided to drive to a church for confession to a priest, and then suffered a fatal heart-attack at the wheel, the moral sociology of this would have been the same for her, discovered in a car with stolen money and no immediate sign that she repented of her sins.Does this make 'Psycho' a heavy lesson in Christian morality? Absolutely not! Because Hitchcock is not playing just the one game, but several. As to the morality, for instance, it would certainly be a heavy message if it weren't so dam'ed obvious that Hitchcock doesn't take it seriously! The Freudian explanation, and Perkins' final dissolution into the persona of the dead mother form a bizarre bit of comic relief, intended to provide quick and easy explanations to any audience needing these.It may help some viewers to know that Hitchcock said that the only really frightening moment in the film - for him - was the sudden cut to a close up of a state trooper wearing sunglasses when Leigh awakes in her car. Hitchcock was almost paranoid about the police (it actually does show up in a number of films, beginning with 'Blackmail' from '29). This is one reason his characters frequently seem to have nowhere to turn when they find themselves in legally questionable or suspect situations. And it is this state trooper who first suggests to Leigh that she ought not to sleep in her car but find a bed for the night - which suggestion finally leads to her decision to visit the Bates Motel....Well, who's guilty now?",10,1,1,4 September 2007
Man on Fire," whatever became of Tony Scott?
","This is clearly not Tony Scott's century. Scott made some really cool movies in the 1990s; apparently around 2001, he dropped way too much LSD and his talent went blooie. Maybe he should retire until 2101 just so he can detox.Anything good in this movie is coming out of star Denzel Washington and Brian Helgeland's script. Unfortunately Scott feels he has to shoot the whole script, so we get a half-hour at the end we don't really need - the film should really end when one of the characters (I won't say who) commits suicide to right a wrong; we don't need the 'uplifting' sequence that follows.Beyond the unnecessary final half-hour, the film is filled with equally unnecessary flashy lights and rapid-edits that distract from the real drama of the first third of the film, and water-down the potential for real action scenes in the second third.What's needed here is direction by John Woo, not a potboiling hack-job from Tony Scott, who has clearly lost any sense of what he wants to do in film.Oh, and just by the way, bits and pieces of this film are borrowed from an underground blaxploitation cult-film, 'Bogard'/aka 'Black Fist' The existing copy of that film (available on DVD) is a wretched re-edit hatchet-job, but there's enough there to indicate the power of the original - which presents acting as good as we get in Scott's film, and better direction - and with almost no budget, compared with the many millions thrown away by Scott.You don't need a lot of money to make a good film - you need a heart and a head and the right hormones. Scott had all these, once; I wonder what became of him?",6,13,26,24 August 2007
Army of Darkness," Definitely not your usual horror film
","Seemingly made as something of a throw-away (the film appears to have been made fairly quickly, and with tongues in both cheeks), this film manages to parody contemporary sci-fi fantasies and horror movies, while providing some scary moments of its own. (The tiny Bruce Campbell clones are silly and amusing, but they're also creepy and unpredictably nasty.) Clearly intended as the 'Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court' of B-movies, what's surprising is how successful it is in accomplishing this. This super-market-budget medieval post-Modern reality has its own inner logic and plays it out faithfully and with élan.You don't have to be a genius to like this film; but if you are a genius, you shouldn't feel guilty liking this film, either. It's both simple and direct, but clever and witty; this makes it work on a number of levels, which most films of this type cannot even aspire to.As for Bruce Cambell - he not only turns in a great performance, but does so playing a regular guy who happens to get smart and courageous when he has to - a real hero for an unheroic age.",9,3,4,15 November 2006
American Gangster," not the best, but pretty good
","There's a major problem doing a movie set in the 1970s, which was a period of major cultural transition. Many of the fashions of that day never went away; others were actually revivals from the 1950s. Still others came and went and then were later revived. I remark this because some reviews complain of the period detail in this film. But I have never seen a single film set in the 1970s anywhere true to that decade, which was the most memorably important of my life. So until someone can show me such a film, I just don't bother quibbling over the detail work set in that era.That said history, both real and cinematic are important here. The film opens remarking two events, each of which received attention in major films: from the mid-1930s, the Harlem underworld was dominated by Bumpy Johnson, who claimed to have retired in the late '40s, but this was not true, and remained mob boss above 125th Street until his death in the mid-'60s. His early career was depicted in the recent film 'Hoodlum,' but he also appeared as a character (as 'Bumpy Jones') in the original 'Shaft.' Just about the same time, in the mid-'60s, a large quantity of heroin smuggled in from France was confiscated by an earnest NYC Detective, Eddie 'Popeye' Egan, which unfortunately did not lead to the mass convictions of narcotics-connected mobsters probably due to mob influence on the courts. This event was narrated in the film 'The French Connection.' The confiscated heroin itself disappeared thanks to corruption in the NYPD itself.Since Harlem was the big marketplace for illegal narcotics, it could be expected that these two stories would eventually intertwine; and that they did is documented in both texts of criminal investigators and reporters, as well as a number of fictional films from the 1970s; but this is the first film to tie the loose ends together. The sustaining element in both stories was the corruption in the police, the courts, and the government of New York, a problem that has never been completely resolved.American Gangster has to be judged as a recorded episode in this history, and it can be fairly compared with the movies previously mentioned. To be frank, it lacks the grand scope of 'Hoodlum' and the energetic realism of 'The French Connection,' but is on a par with some of the better films dealing with other aspects of this history - which it appears to reflect honestly, having both central players on board as consultants. It's not one of Ridley Scott's best movies, but it is a fascinating dual portrait of a shrewd hood running out of time and the honest cop hunting him down. Neither Washington nor Crowe are at their best here - I feel they needed more prep-time for their characters - but the turn in solid performances, as do the rest of the cast-members. And the work behind the camera is also solidly professional, as we've come to expect from director Scott's crews. But I admit I expected something a little more, since the core story and its history are so profoundly interesting, raising unsettling questions about American society and its particular economic culture. ( I can't remember in what movie a character explains that heroin is the perfect commodity, since its addicted consumers will spend any amount of money for it and get pretty much nothing in return.) So American Gangster is not the final statement on the continuing problem of the culture of narcotics or that of police corruption; but it is an interesting and entertaining gangster film, and a fairly reliable document of the events it portrays.",8,1,2,5 January 2009
Lord of War," brilliant but problematic
","One important point to get out of the way - the use of Interpol in this film is indeed completely fictional, but it has been a conventional fiction in films, especially action films, since the late 1960s, so I am willing to pardon its use here. However, I should also note that this is not an action film, it is not technically even a 'thriller,' and part of the difficulty assessing the film is in trying to determine precisely what it is.This is in many ways a brilliant film, both visually and in its dialog, and both a thoughtful and thought-provoking expose of the contemporary arms industry. Yet it has two difficulties in its structure that make it difficult to recommend without qualification. Both have been noted in previous reviews: first, we don't get to see the development of gun-runner Orlov's business, from his first sale to his appearance at an arms-sales convention, where he is already well-known, albeit only as 'an amateur.' How does he get from Brooklyn to there with limited funds? There's actually only one probable answer - major loans - but this is only hinted at when he remarks about using credit cards to pay off credit cards. And even this doesn't explain how he adapted to the culture of illegal arms sales when he first entered it. That's important because obviously that introduction would have gone into the worlds of, first, street gangs, then mobs, then international crime cartels - we know this is true, since we do get the one glimpse of a major sale to a South American drug dealer. But surely this would only be the tip of the iceberg.The other problem in the structure is more difficult to address, because it is also part of the film's strength. The first two thirds of the movie are presented as high-irony satire on the international arms market. It is only as the final third unfolds that we begin to realize that Orlov, as voice-over narrator, is not speaking ironically, he actually means every word he says. The tone of the film then shifts dramatically into tragedy.The strength of this movement is that we at last discover Orlov to be a cold-blooded socio-path, even able to disregard the death of his brother, since it doesn't entirely impede the arms deal he is engaged in at the time. This is a man who has only one reason to live, to develop a successful illegal arms trading business. Nothing else matters to him, and because of that he is actually more wretched than the murderous thugs he deals with - they, at least, enjoy what they do, he is merely obsessed with his profession.That's a powerful statement, to be sure. The question is whether this dramatic shift in tone really works, or have we been, as more than one reviewer expressed it, deceived by the comedic beginning into buying a kind of numbed sociological drama? One reviewer compared this film to Scorcese's 'Goodfellows,' but Scorcese affects the shift from ironic commentary on Mafia culture to actual gangster film drama in a gradual convolution punctuated by moments of intense violence that point out the moral degradation we should have been admitting all along. 'Lord of War' reads as pure satire until the moment it isn't amusing at all, and that is very disturbing. It's hard to say yet whether that is a good thing, or whether it is asking too much from its audience.Otherwise, as noted, much of the film-making is actually brilliant - in the script and the visuals; and the editing holding these elements together is solid. The acting is quite good, although I found Cage lacking focus occasionally - but this may have to do with the shift in tone noted above. And the film's topic is certainly important enough to consider.But it's not clear whether a film can go down this path without surrendering some important clarity. I had the same sense with the sudden shift in tone towards the end of 'No Country for Old Men;' and as with 'No Country,' at the end of this film, one is left with an uneasy sense of helplessness. I'm not sure that's where the director wanted to leave us, and I'm not sure whether I like, or even accept, being there.",7,0,0,21 February 2009
WALL·E," half a great sci-fi film
","I had to think a while before writing this. There is a central problem to the film, just taken as a computer-graphic animation feature, that no one seems to have noticed - namely the animation in the second half of the film is nowhere near as good as that of the first half, and seems to have been accomplished with a lower budget and lowered aspirations on the part of the animators. The important visual cue here is the presentation of EVE who becomes virtually two-dimensional once inside of the mother-ship.This odd division in quality seems to be directly connected to the two-part structure of the story (one part Earth, one part space-ship). The first half of the film is a complicated piece of science-fiction, similar to the best of the genre we remember from the 1960s golden age of The Twighlight Zone, of the original Planet of the Apes and maybe 2001, and the novels of Azimov and Phillip K. Dick. Wall-E, the garbage collecting robot, has not only survived all similar robots (who apparently failed from exhaustion), 'he' has evolved, and now learns how to survive, and in the process develops a real personality - one capable of longing for something more, specifically contact with his own 'species.' That transits easily into a new narrative as Wall-E encounters another, newer model robot who is still on the lower end of the AI learning curve.Once the story arrives at the space-ship, everything changes. For one thing, Wall-E himself gets displaced from the center of the story. EVE's AI evolution takes an inexplicable quantum leap, and she ends up behaving in a completely human way, which Wall-E to the last never does. The story then reduces to simple action-thriller in a fantasy mode and the element of character development - which is what really drives the first half - gets lost. The theme also degenerates. The implicit satire on the human race in the first half of the film is made explicit, but in this loses much of its bite. The humans vicious enough to destroy the Earth's eco-system are now simply silly in their pampered decay.Still, the dynamism of the first half is strong enough to carry us through the second half. The story loses credibility, but we are too concerned for the fate of our heroes to care much about that. And that concern alerts us to the real strengths of the first half of the film. It's not easy to grow to love an expressionless box on tractor-treads, but that's what the first half of the film gets from us. If only the film makers had been wise enough and bold enough to recognize this and develop a stronger second half derived from this awareness.",7,1,4,7 December 2008
Iron Man," Okay matinée fun
","The plot is typical super hero movie; the superhero appears in three major scenes, with the bulk give over to the trials and tribulations of the 'secret identity' character. Pure formula, and not one I've ever had much admiration for. When I pay to see a movie about a superhero, I want to see the superhero, I don't care about the secret identity.The much touted special effects are really pretty much 'more of the same,' nothing special here.The action is fun, but the 'tech sequences drag.The big plus of the movie is Robert Downey Jr. He plays Stark with a truly sophisticated wit lacking in most of these films (Michael Keaton's original Batman might also be an exception).Okay matinée fun, but hardly a 'blockbuster.'",7,2,5,2 August 2008
Casino Royale," 'Millenium' series James Bond - top-of-the-line!
","In the original Bond series, only a handful of films really attempted to touch base with the novels of Ian Fleming. 'Dr. No' showed the Fleming feeling for character and action, but introduced elements to the plot that detracted from the 'hard-boiled' spy story that Fleming thought he was writing; 'Thunderball' came close, but that was because Fleming developed the story on commission for the film. 'On Her Majesty's Secret Service' had the book's plot pretty down pat, and was made in a kind of 'grand adventure' style, but of course it suffered from the choice of Lazenby - a professional model, not an actor - as Bond. 'The Living Daylights' showed the producers' interest in returning to the roots, but Dalton was uncomfortable playing Bond, and uncomfortable with the wisecracks which had become part of the character's schtick - and which were really badly written for the Dalton films. 'Goldeneye' was admirable attempt to update the Fleming milieu for the end of the Cold War, but left the character himself as yet without an 'updated' definition.The decision to make a 21st Century version of Fleming's first Bond novel - and, beyond the update, to remain true to the novel, sans comic patter, sans sci-fi techno-schtick, sans major rewrite of the basic plot - promised to present Bond fans of all ages with a direct challenge. Do we want the hard-boiled spy Fleming first envisioned - patterned after Chandler's Philip Marlowe and W. Somerset Maughm's Ashenden ('or: The British Agent')? Or would we really rather have the suave stand-up comedian and Playboy magazine contributor introduced by Broccoli, Maibaum, Young, and company, in the second Connery film, 'From Russia With Love'?Well, the votes are still being tallied on that.As someone who came to Bond reading 'Goldfinger' at the tender age of twelve (the phrase 'round, firm, pointed breasts' has been an inspiration to me since), the closer the films came to the sense of the novels, the happier I was.So of course, this version of Bond is a joyous surprise for me - my youthful daydreams have been vindicated and at last fully satisfied. There are indeed elements added to the plot, but they are completely congruent with it. There is the use of current technology, but no techno-schtick - i.e., no Q. and no 'gadgets'. There are the luscious Bond babes (2 - the minimum Bond requirement), but there is no attempt to reduce them to photogenic sex-toys.Fleming's plot actually requires the film's addition of some heavy action sequences (all done very snappy, with a brutally realistic edge), because the novel is very claustrophobic; the original TV version of the story (1955, with Barry Nelson as 'Jimmy Bond'), only used three indoor sets, because it could - except for the car chase and an attempted bombing at an outdoor café, Fleming's novel took place almost entirely within Bond's hotel suite and the gaming room. The film's opening this novel out to the world is actually quite welcome, and does not affect the central plot or its theme.The character of Bond presented in this film may disappoint followers of the original films, but the news is, this is FLEMING's Bond - an orphan uncertain of his own identity, a disillusioned romantic trying hard to pretend he's incapable of emotions, a middle class, middle-brow, middle-level management type who just happens to kill people for a living. But he does it extremely well.The other problem some general viewers may have is the level of violence in the film; having determined to film the novel realistically, director Martin Campbell has decided to ditch the 'B-movie' violence of most of the earlier films, and present us the violence with a hard 'British neo-noir' edge to it. Given the romantic plot twist toward the end, this would be a perfect date movie - except that the violence left some of the female viewers in the theater I attended clearly unsettled. That's not necessarily a bad thing, it just is part of the gestalt of the film's experience.Cambell's direction is very good; the writing is crisp; production values are very high; the photography is stunning. Some of the stunt work is truly remarkable, worthy competition for Jackie Chan. The acting is rock-solid and believable for these characters. There is plenty of muscle for the action-film fan, and some real brains for the more general viewer to ponder later. This film is best viewed with minimal reliance on knowledge of the previous series. In fact, it functions perfectly well as a 'one-off', a film without a series.But of course, the ending invites a sequel. In Godzilla terms, Connery and Moore having given us the 'showa' Bond, Dalton and Brosnan the 'Heisei' Bond, we now have the 'Millenium' series James Bond - not a prequel nor even a 'reboot', but, really, an entirely new series about the same character. It is probably too much to hope for, but maybe they can make the sequels just as good as this.As a genre film it never quite lifts above its genre; so normally I would only give it 'nine stars' as a film.However, as a film within its genre, it is top-of-the-line - so it gets a ten.",10,213,308,22 November 2006
Identity," almost a great film, but with cheap lousy ending
","This is in many ways an excellent movie. Although it pretends to be deeper than it really is, it is still smart, stylish, extremely well made, neatly paced, with strong performances from all the actors.Yet I must lodge a complaint. It's the ending. Difficult to explain what goes wrong here without revealing it, so I'll write in generalities. By the end of the film, when the pieces at last begin to fit together, we come to feel some compassion for the characters that we know are essentially decent and we learn to wish the best for them. The ending betrays that, and is thus annoying and disappointing. Whatever first went wrong with the killer here happens yet again. Life's just a joke, after all, and a rather cruel one.This is not only unfair to the characters, but to the audience as well. a less violent ending would not have betrayed the heart of the film, but would instead have reached the depth the film pretends to seek.Definitely worth the trip, but might be more satisfying if you just skip the last five minutes.",8,3,5,9 December 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," grand finale to a classic action film series
","As with the another recent attempt to revive an '80s action series - 'Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull' - I'm sure most of us hope this will be the last we see of this franchise - but for completely different reasons. 'Kingdom' was an embarrassing visit to 'been-there, done-that' land with a tired director and a tired-looking actor tried to relive the golden moment of their action-film prime. So, please, no more from Indiana Jones.Here we have an entirely different scenario. This film is almost as good (perhaps better, it's a matter of taste) as 'Die Hard II.' And if we don't want to see John McLane again, it's because we don't want Willis et al. embarrassing themselves the way Spielberg and Harrison did. We all knew that 'Die Hard III' was a pretty weak finale to one of the more exciting action film trilogies in American cinema; and I think most most of us should now feel that the real finale to the story of John McLane has at last appeared - he got older; he never remarried; he didn't end up a drunk; he's still a cop; he can still kick butt in his middle age. And the story is no more ridiculous than that of Die Hard II or III, but the execution is certainly way above that of Die Hard III. I mean, the action doesn't stop, yet there's plenty of time for plot development and even the quirky, melodramatic character development we saw in the first and second films of the series.Also, it must be noted, Willis, who went sleep-walking through Die Hard III, is here again in fine form, complete with true grit and blue-collar wit. He never pretends to b a super-hero, he just gets stuck with a super-hero's role (and plenty of incredible luck, of course).Of course it's outlandish, and a lot of the stunts involve CGI. And he story is so wild, one reason to hope this is the last of the series is because 'out-doing' themselves would mean sending McLane off on a mission to mars, and that really would end all credibility.So, assuming this is as wild as they could get, and letting the Die Hard series just be what it is - blockbuster action films for the sake of entertainment - this is one of the best.",9,2,5,31 January 2009
Amélie," Perfect romantic comedy
","Amelie is by far the most beautiful romantic comedy made in the West in a very long time. I keep trying to come up with comparisons, but the freshness of plotting and the timelessness of the setting assure the film's unique. The director clearly feels the temptation to take us off into a fantasy, with Amelie magically making everything perfect for everyone, but always pulls his story and characters back to earth to remind us that the theme of his story is neither spiritual nor sexual but emotional - about the desperate need we all have to be recognized as special by at least one other person we feel is special.The acting is all shamelessly excellent in that manner peculiar to French cinema - great French actors have no modesty when it comes to their talents, and great French directors incorporate this virtue into their films, as we see done here. The cinematography is gorgeous, and works equally well on large and small screens. I suppose there are quibble-points in the details, but the pacing doesn't give us any time to linger over these. The overall design of the film - to make the Paris of 2001 seem as romantic as that of 1890 as frequently treated in cinema - is achieved almost flawlessly.Finally, it has to be said, there is nothing inaccessibly 'arty' here, this is a very funny film. This is a film that can appeal to everyone, on several different levels, and really needs wider exposure to a larger audience than hitherto. Very refreshing.",10,1,5,16 April 2008
Godzilla," Godzilla's story (now that's entertainment!)
","Going into this film, I only wanted an entertaining B movie that honored the Toho series I grew up with. And I am completely satisfied with what I got.Because of the enormous amounts of money spent on genre films these days, many people are under the illusion that 'B movie' is a derogatory designation. That is nonsense. Some of my most beloved films are B movies - wonderful adventure thrillers, action fests, horror stories, westerns, mysteries. Sure there are B movies that excel and leap into 'A list' territory (e.g., 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly'). But there's nothing wrong in making a great B Movie - A lot of films by such as Howard Hawks and Alfred Hitchcock were put together with no greater desire than to entertain a ticket buying audience. That's all a B Movie has to do.'Godzilla' does that grandly. It IS a B movie; so is Hawks' 'El Dorado' or Hitchcock's 'Psycho.' So it is in good company. And (like all great B movies) it is very entertaining.Edwards succeeds partly because he has designed the movie to look like a movie. This is not a visual roller-coaster ride. No shaky-cam or MTV editing here. The sometimes quick closure to action moments, like with Godzilla's first meeting with the MUTO, are clearly intended to bring the audience to the edge of their seats demanding more. This did not work for some critics, but it worked for me. I never felt like I was getting less than I wanted.Also, the pacing was far stronger and more rapid than many reviews had led me to believe. The narrative drive, once one grasps the real narrative, is utterly relentless. And what I mean by that is, the real story here is not about any of the humans. This movie is called 'Godzilla,' not because he's on screen most of the time (he's not, although we see him far earlier than any of the critics have reported - like in the title sequence) or because he's the 'main' monster (he's not that either, although he plays a much more important role than the others do); but because it's HIS story - it's HIS conflict, and, being THE agent, HE has to resolve it. (The MUTOs are important because they are part of that story, and it is partly their story as well - and they are terrifying, BTW.) Edwards shoots this story slightly off-center, through the eyes of humans trying to cope, only because he has a human audience to play to. (If the audience were all just radioactive lizards, there wouldn't be a human on the screen. But it would still be the same story.)BTW, all of the critics complaining about the somewhat undeveloped characters here have missed the big boat. Whether consciously or not, Gareth Edwards and his team have achieved a remarkable conceptual construction here, staggering in its simplicity and audacity. They have grafted a ('90s) 'Heisei' era Godzilla story (see, e.g.,: 'Godzilla and Mothra Battle for Earth') onto a 1950's era Hollywood science fiction film - think 'Them!,' Pal's 'War of the Worlds,' or the original 'Thing from Another World.' As I watched these characters struggle to come to grips with their monster problem and still get on getting a job done, I kept thinking of the scientists and soldiers facing similar problems in '50s American sci-fi movies, responding in similar ways with similarly compressed explanations and suppressed emotions. Edwards makes up for any lack of depth to these characters by keeping the perspective on the monster action as close to humans experiencing it as possible - much the way that the directors of the '50s did. The complaints against Aaron Taylor-Johnson, missing this point, miss the finesse of his performance - he is doing what Edwards wants him to do, standing in as 'Everyman' avatar for the audience (much like James Arness in 'Them!'); any stronger performance would have been distracting.But the main story is of course the monsters'; that also has been missed. The humans are witnessing the culmination of a conflict beginning millions of years ago. Consequently, they are merely annoyances for the monsters who are enacting their ancient struggle for natural resources. This drama is in fact a fluidly unfolding whole, which critics who try to impose a classic '3 act' structure on it fail to see. This film has a prologue, the narrative certainly has connecting episodes, but there are no 'acts' - once in the present day, it just goes.Which is why the finale is actually quite satisfying. For the real protagonist of the film, with the big fight over, there's no need for a wrap-up - and surely no need for commentary from those pesky little hairless apes, who don't have the slightest clue as to what's really going on in the world they think they dominate.What more need be said? Like the '50s sci-fi movies it so heartedly evokes, the dialog is sometimes silly and cliché. The photography and design are solid; the music is not at all dull, it is supportive of the visuals without drawing attention to itself (which is a classic '50s era soundtrack composition rule-of-thumb, BTW). The CGI is state of the art (I saw it in 2D and it looked great). And there are a lot of 'Holy Crap!' moments that are truly memorable.And did it pay homage and honor to the source material, the original series produced by Toho, 28 films over 50 years? Absolutely. The story is very 'Heisei' era, and as good a reboot as 'Godzilla 2000.' For a kaiju eiga junky, this film is seventh heaven. Highly recommended without reserve - and take the kids to see it, preferably at a drive in with lots of popcorn. (That's how I first saw Godzilla - memories are made of such as this.)",10,8,17,16 May 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," beginning of the end
","Paul to the Corinthians - 'when i was a child, i thought as a child and played as a child; but when i became a man, i put away my childish things.' i was living near new york city when this film was first released - i think this was a test release in the new york area; the original promo suggested a serious science-fiction story, along the lines of the cult-favorite 'dune'. it bombed. shortly afterward, on re-release Lucas got the promo he really wanted - part fairy-tale, part Jungian Ur-myth, part retro-serial - and the rest is history. but the history of what -this film marks the beginning of the end of serious film-making in America. fairy-tales are for children; the old serial films were fun, but badly made; and 'Jungian Ur-myths' constitute a debatable psycho-babble theory; thus what Lucas was really telling his audience, in both film and promo, was that we all needed to be children watching bad films written by Carl Jung - or at least Jungian literary theorist Joseph Campbell, who was actually hired as consultant on this film.humans, to maintain their self-respect, need to grapple with difficult moral issues, we need to mature, and to learn how to relate to other human beings in complex and sometimes difficult situations; and we need the freedom to think for ourselves in such matters, to risk our own happiness and to live with the consequences. no one is saying that children should not enjoy fairy-tales, and perhaps they really do need these for psychological development. but even eventually children need to 'grow-up' - to stop being children.'star wars' would not have been so damaging to this culture if it had presented itself as a children's film. but Lucas was quite explicitly targeting, as audience, burnt out hippies, participants of the failed 'cultural revolution' of the '60s; and in doing so, he began steering them toward the political decisions that would at last put our culture and its economy, and its future, into terrible jeopardy - voting for Reagan, selfishly demanding tax cuts, mockery of dissent and dissenters, and flocking into paganistic 'fundamentalist Christian' churches seeking 'spiritual awakening' and, as many now proclaim, apocalypse.well, obviously, just one movie isn't going to accomplish all that. what the success of star wars did was to distract adult attention from ethically mature films where moral choices could be examined in their complexity; to such an extent that Hollywood - never all that supportive of such films, anyway - simply stopped making such films for a time. the bottom came in 1985, when the 2 best films to use truly cinematic storytelling to wrestle with mature choices were from japan - Kurosawa's 'ran' and 'Godzilla 1985'. and you know the world's doomed when a big green lizard has to be the one to make you ask important questions about the ecology, and history, and whatever place in the larger universe our tiny species finds itself.i mention Godzilla not simply for rhetorical effect. like the old fairy-tales, Godzilla is best appreciated by the young and the young at heart; like the old serial films, the Godzilla films are filled with gaffs and silliness; like the typical Jungian Ur-myth or archetype, Godzilla calls to some deeper part of our psyche, which is why we are entertained by his appearance.but unlike star wars, the Godzilla films never insist that they are the only show around - or at least the only worth viewing. and unlike star wars, they never pretend to be better than they are, or that they're accomplishing some necessary cultural mission. and unlike star wars, they do not insist that we remain 'forever young', only that we respect our having once been young, and that we respect the youth of others. and unlike star wars, they are inherently democratic - not because they insist we all be individuals, but rather that they insist that we all are already individuals, and yet to survive, we must come together and learn to depend on one another - democracy only has value to a collective of individuals, a human society. rabid individualists are monsters - rather like Godzilla's most intractable foe, king ghidorah.well, that's the big argument. for those who prefer simple solutions - star wars is a crude, fascistic, socially-retarded scam that the ex-hippies foisted on what was once a great culture. whether it will ever achieve greatness again - or whether it shall have cinema when it does - remains open to question.'now we see as through a glass, darkly, but then face to face.'",1,65,174,3 August 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," masterpiece of satirical film-making
","Much of the work by the Python crew has dated badly, looking more weird than funny. Much of the best of it is a manic-depressive's visualization of the old radio 'Goon Show'; the innovations the Pythons brought to their material are really drawn from Beckett and Ionesco and other playwrights of the 'Theater of the Absurd', which had exhausted itself by the time the Pythons turned it into pure comedy, thus reviving it for one last go around.'The Holy Grail' is the exception to this general historical trajectory. There are two reasons for this: 1) Plot. There are actually two plots here: one is the search for the Grail, the other only makes its appearance in brief (but important) episodes - yet this is actually the grounding plot of the film.Basically, someone is making a movie for television about Arthur and the Holy Grail. They don't have much money to spend, so they touch up the legend a bit to add some violence, titillation, and even magic, although they can't afford decent special effects. (So they're reduced to fighting a rabbit rather than a dragon). However, to give their project credibility, they hire a historian to jabber platitudes to cover up the holes in their plot-line. However, one of the cast goes crazy and kills the historian. After a brief investigation, the police decide to arrest the whole lot.This double plot development works very well, largely because it is accomplished through purely cinematic methods - editing, camera angles, etc. - rather through any exposition.2) Theme. 'The Holy Grail' was released more than a year before the appearance of the Sex Pistols punk band, but the Pythons are clearly on the same wave-length as the Pistols here. There has never been an approach to the 'legendary past' of Great Britain so viciously and energetically iconoclastic as this. It's impossible to laugh your way through this film and then find anything half-way believable in 'Camelot' or 'Exclaibur' or 'Sword in the Stone.' It's not by chance that, since the making of this film, the Arthur legend has had to be seriously revised until the films concerning it have become little more than sci-fi fantasies without the science. We know now what the ancient Britons were - mud-wallowing, lice-infested dullards, with 'knights' who were only interested in loot and rapine. (Let the Disney people make a movie about that!) Over all, then, this remains a great one-off masterpiece of satirical film-making. That the Pythons never bettered it only makes it all the more remarkable.",10,1,2,14 October 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," cynical cash-in of the worst variety
","Messy, even ridiculous, tribute to the James Bond films of the 1960s, and a disastrous finale to the original Indiana Jones series.Like the locations, the plot is all over the map. Well, sure adventure films should travel the globe easily - but there ought to be a reason for it. The clues leading to the final discovery really have nothing to do with one another, are forced into patterns that really make no sense, and are simply used as excuses to drag the characters from England to Germany to Italy to Egypt - well, eventually, we loose track of just where.Ford and Connery ham it up something fierce. The sets look like sets. The cinematography is second rate. The editing is competent and not much else. Spielberg seems to have fallen asleep in the director's chair quite a bit ('uh, are we making a movie? why didn't you wake me up?') The ending: pseudo-Christian pseudo-Mystical blather, not at all in keeping with any Christian mythos or morality, and dependent on B-movie puzzle solving, pratfalls, and cliff-hanging that utterly debase the mythic references to cheap rumors about possible gods.This is cynical cash-in of the worst variety; stay away.",1,38,87,1 July 2007
Hustle & Flow," close to real life
","A very good film. I have noted criticism that the film slips into formula in its second half; true. But the situation is so bleak for these characters, I doubt that American audiences would have accepted a more believable ending; and, after all, there were far worse 'happy' endings that it avoids.The gritty staging, the solid no-frills camera-work and editing, and some really excellent performances make this well worth the effort to confront dishonest characters struggling to find some sort of integrity in their efforts to survive and succeed. These characters are not likable - none of them are, they each have a tic that denies them total sympathy from the audience. But they are all very human for that, and so ultimately win our respect if not approval.Among the actors, two performances especially shine. Terrence Howard as DJay shows timing and expression worthy of much older, more 'schooled' actors. Anthony Anderson is a real and pleasant surprise; stuck in character roles for the past decade, Anderson has become a real annoyance to me, as the usual character he plays is really excessive, a caricature. In this role, he is allowed to just act, and he delivers a wholly believable multifaceted performance.Hollywood has been producing such bad films that saying this film is among the best released this year may not be saying much (there are real and undeniable weaknesses to the film). Nonetheless, on the whole, the film is a commendable and rewarding effort to present a drama involving human beings living close to real life, and not cartoons. I credit that effort, and recommend a viewing.",8,6,7,23 September 2005
The Birds," what is it you most fear?
","Daphne Du Maurier's work largely falls into he category of 'gothic romance' - not the kind that has glutted supermarkets since the '50s, her best known books really hark back to the genre's roots in the 19th century. Her short story, 'The Birds,' is something of an anomaly in her work - on the surface its a sci-fi/disaster story that ends grimly (the farmer's family is pretty much doomed); but it is also clearly an expressive allegory for what it must have felt like for many British during the Battle of Britain - the description of an army of seagulls appearing on the horizon could easily be that of a fleet of German bombers. The giveaway line comes from the farmer's wife when she remarks that 'surely the Americans will do something.' Of course they did, and they and the British went on to defeat the Germans, which makes the post-war publication of the story a little out of date.Hitchccock had gotten one of his most successful films from Du Maurier's work - Rebecca - as well as one of his least successful, Under Capricorn. Deciding to take one of her most popular but least typical short stories as source for The Birds may have involved some risk - especially considering what he added to the original material. Obviously there was no longer any purpose served in evoking the Battle of Britain, so the location of the film is moved to America. The birds of the film then take on an entirely different quality - they become what can be called 'an open metaphor' meaning that they can be interpreted in any number of ways. To one asking 'why are they attacking humans en masse?' the proper response is 'what is it you most fear? that's what they will represent to you.' Hitchcock does provide us with a key to his own interpretation, by adding a clinging mother to the family unit. Hitchcock, for better or worse, is the most overtly Freudian of directors - as the birds gather in the background preparing their assault, the central players quietly dance around the problem of the lead female's sexual attraction to a man whom his mother has effectively neutered. Only the sudden onslaught of the birds allows him the moment to reclaim his status as head of the family, and by that time his would-be lover has been severely damaged. Anyone who knows Hitchcock's body of work will recognize how this resonates with themes of sexuality and fear in his other films.But, again the birds are an open metaphor - Hitchcock is clever enough not to bind their threat too tightly to his own paranoias here. We are free to interpret them as we please, and to read the domestic drama as mere back-story to their unpredictable attacks. The film's suspense thus hinges, not on our concern for the family's problems, but on our own fears of inexplicable and sudden catastrophe. I think the effort to achieve that is entirely successful, and this is one of Hitchcock's most unsettling, and most memorable, accomplishments.",10,3,6,28 March 2011
V for Vendetta," Classical film-making
","I was so afraid this film would just be more opportunistic betrayal of my political ideals, I avoided it for two years. Wow, was I ever mistaken! This is a great film in the classic tradition - there's nothing confusing or 'avant garde' here, this is straight-ahead unabashedly Romantic film-making, and the best of its kind I've seen in a long time.Yes, V is a terrorist - and the film never pretends he's innocent, in any way; yes, what happens to the female lead is both morally and emotionally ambiguous. And yes, the 'right people' in the film make serious mistakes, and the 'bad people' actually have an understandable argument to make.All this makes this film a thinking-person's adventure film. Nobody here is a puppet on anybody's string.And the final question - which must remain with an audience not living in a fantasy - is, what does it really mean to be free? and what are we willing to do to accomplish that? Just by the way, although the film ends by playing the opening of the Rolling Stones' 'Street Fighting Man', there are sly references throughout to the Sex Pistols' 'Anarchy in the UK' - and the film knows this and earns the right to it, despite the total absence of 'punk' in its visuals.Easily the equal of 'Cyrano DeBergerac' - a myth for the hell we currently pass through - highly recommended, to this generation and the next.",10,3,7,15 May 2007
