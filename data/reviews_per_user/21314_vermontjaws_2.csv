Hereditary," Not the girl in the poster
","The moment i saw the movie poster i thought 'oh gee...another case of possesed girl film'. so i said to myself i've got nothing better to do, so why not? let's watch this. I have to say it was a creepy ride maybe too slow at the very beggining but all of the sudden becomes terrifying. the acting and the story is great, can't tell about the music 'cos i was scaring to hear the 'clock' mouth sound. A must seen great horror film. Appearances are deceiving or should i say 'never judge a movie by the girl in the poster'.",10,5,11,10 June 2018
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," The force is not strong with this one
","As a fan of the star wars films i feel pretty dissapointed about this one. it doesn't feel like star wars universe. First:Luke drinking milk from an alien?Are you kidding me? Maybe in space there'll be no cows, but this was necessary to show? I almost puke my soda at this ! and BB8 throwing coins to guards? gee, at least R2 has some dignity at using laser rays. Rey snaping fingers? Man, I was praying she didn't start dancing like in most Disney's movies are. And in the climax scene when we were all waiting a hell of a fight, hoping Luke kicks Kylo Ren ass in a way far better than Kenobi did to Anakin simply didn't happen.. ! (what the !.. that's it?)
All about the sets, the plot and the humor displayed in this film made me feel about to cry, not to mention by the two hours I was praying for it to end. Hard to believe this is a STAR WARS movie. For all this and more i think This is THE LAST JEDI (STAR WARS) MOVIE i'll ever see.",3,1,1,15 December 2017
