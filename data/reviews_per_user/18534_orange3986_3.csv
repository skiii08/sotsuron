The Sound of Music," Absolutely Amazing!
","This movie has been a favorite of mine all my life. I was privileged enough to be a part of the production at my highschool this past year. It is my very favorite movie. I honestly know all of the lines to the movie, I know things about the movie that shock people. I even know what the actors are doing now...no I'm not weird, I just love this movie that much, and you will too if you haven't ever seen it before and watch it for the first time ever!",10,1,7,11 July 2002
Dirty Dancing," A timeless love story...
","I have to say that this movie is one of my all time favorites. Some people categorize it as a chick flick, or a coming of age movie, but it's really a great movie! It's not as cheesy as some of the other movies in the above categories. It really is a timeless movie, that will continue to be enjoyed by people of all ages.",10,0,0,11 July 2002
Coyote Ugly," I watched it a million times!
","We got this movie from netflix and I watched it the first time, and watched it over 5 times in all! This is an amazing story with great actors and actresses. Piper Perabo is an awesome actress! The story holds a special something that makes you want to watch it over and over again! I highly suggest this movie if you've never seen it before!",10,1,2,11 July 2002
