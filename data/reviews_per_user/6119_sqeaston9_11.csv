Alien 3," The follow up to Aliens few of us wanted to see
","When I first saw this movie I absolutely hated it. It totally invalidated the ending of Aliens, I didn't like most of the characters (who were hard to tell apart), and I found it to be a depressing body count movie. My feelings have mellowed a little since, and while I still consider it fairly poor at least it wasn't as bad as Alien:Resurrection.*** Spoilers follow *** I think the first problem most of us had were the deaths of Hicks and Newt. After the ending of Aliens we'd come to love these characters, and to kill them off in such a way was a huge turn off.I soon realised the only character I cared about aside from Ripley was the Doctor (Charles Dance), but he died fairly early and it soon became obvious that Ripley was going to die too (with an Alien inside her).So the bald guys get killed one by one and I couldn't care less.On the plus side some of the visuals were good, and the movie was successful in evoking a dark and depressive tone. But with no emotional involvement or interesting plot, the experience was just flat.After the first two movies in the franchise, this had a lot to live up to, and in that respect, and like so many third installments, it failed.",6,4,62,2 January 2009
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Painful
","I was 13 when when I first saw Star Wars, and like most boys at that time thought it was the hands down best movie I'd ever seen. Fast forward to years later and I learn there's going to be another Star Wars trilogy. Like many males I still happily have a childish side, and looked forward to the The Phantom Menace with enormous anticipation, a must see at the cinema.*** Spoilers follow *** It all started well enough. Some cool action scenes and we get to see what a pair of trained up Jedi can really do. Cool! OK, so the Trade Federation guys sound oriental, but that only became a problem in the context of what was to follow.I continued to enjoy the movie as a light hearted special effects fest for a while and then Jar-Jar appeared. I couldn't believe what I was seeing and hearing, another racial stereotype, but this time in the tradition of Black Face. Now those youngsters among you probably don't know what this is since old movies with this kind of content are rarely shown these days, but in these movies there was a tradition of portraying blacks as comedy morons. They say stupid things and fall about, and are treated as retards by the main characters, and there it was, an alien that behaved and spoke in exactly the same way! I hadn't seen anything like it in a movie made in the past 50 years, I think I was in shock! Then we get the Mexican style junk/slave trader, and a scene where the Gungans are portrayed like idiotic natives meeting white explorers for the first time. WTF? More and more the movie irritated me, such as when they decorate a droid (a tool) for performing it's function. And the scene where the whole Jedi concept is undermined by introducing Mediclorians, a sample of which Qui-Gon 'teleports' to Obi-Wan for analysis. I didn't know teleportation was possible in the Star Wars universe. We learn that C3PO has been custom built by a child (Darth Vader), despite his similarity to other protocol droids.And so we have endless scenes of Jar-Jar behaving like a special needs child, and almost nothing to inform us about the baddie from the movie's title.And then there's the dialogue and the acting. Oh my! The light sabre fight at the end was cool, but it was way too late to save this disaster for me. Just because it's a kids movie doesn't mean you can ignore the principles and ideas established in the first trilogy.The start and the end were good. The special effects were good. But as for the rest of it, argh! I wish this had never been made.George Lucas, you once were great. Congratulations on so thoroughly undermining your greatest achievements.There's a scene in the series Spaced when The Phantom Menace is mentioned to Simon Pegg's character, and he flashes back to a scene where he's weeping and throwing his old Star Wars toys onto a bonfire. I know exactly how he felt.2/10",1,2,3,4 February 2008
Star Trek," Terrible plot undermines what was otherwise good
","So Star Trek returns with it's most visually stunning outing to date. This movie looks great, with very nice sets, special effects, costumes and action set pieces.Similarly, the casting is very good. Quinto is just perfect as Spock, and I found the choices made for the other characters fine as well. This was one of my biggest concerns for this reboot, so bravo! The story effectively creates a new reality for our characters, a major catastrophe means that this is effectively a different universe to Star Trek:TOS. I think this was probably for the best, freeing the writers from the constraints of the existing storyline. I know that many viewers object to this thinking it somehow invalidates other existing Star Trek franchises. It doesn't because it's a different reality. ST:TOS, TNG, DS9 and Voyager are real in their own universe and are as valid as ever.But where the movie really falls down is the plot. There are many plot holes, ridiculous coincidences and incomprehensible decisions made by the characters. It seemed like the plot was simply created to string together the action set pieces regardless of how stupid it turned out. I can understand this being an action orientated movie, but I couldn't help but find myself regularly shaking my head at what I was seeing.The plot is so poor it reduces what would have been 10/10 for a 'Wrath of Khan' quality plot to a mediocre 6/10. Please, more of the same for the next movie but write a decent story, or at least one that makes logical sense. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.",6,2,4,4 January 2012
Spice World," The oldest profession
","Once upon a time there were The Spice Girls. They introduced us to 'girl power', a thinly disguised effort to use sex to sell manufactured pop music, potato chips and fizzy drinks to little kids and morons. And then there was this travesty of a movie.This is very much like other exploitation movies made to cash in on popular music groups in the past, but with all the good elements removed. There is nothing redeemable about this whatsoever, it's pure trash, and since the 'music' of The Spice Girls has no longevity neither does this.If you want to pick this up along with the girl's entire back catalogue of CDs, I recommend checking out the bargain bins in charity shops. You shouldn't have a problem finding it all, and then at least something positive will have come out of this.",1,5,10,13 June 2011
28 Weeks Later," Unbelievable plot that insults the intelligence
","I quite enjoyed the original 28 Days Later despite the problem with the premise. If the infected are uncontrollably violent why don't they attack each other? Who knows, but I was willing to suspend my disbelief and enjoy the ride. I was hoping for more of the same from the sequel, but unfortunately so many unbelievable things happen I found this impossible to view as anything but a farce.*** Spoilers follow *** Robert Carlyle is holed up in a house with his wife and a few other survivors. Unfortunately the place they've chosen has paper thin walls the infected can punch through and they haven't fashioned or collected any weapons, and thus when a group of infected attack they're scr*wed. Robert is forced to abandon his wife and flee, and narrowly escapes.Fast forward to 28 weeks later, and an American military force have recolonised part of London and are guarding British survivors. Most of the infected are dead from starvation (dehydration surely?), but are still considered a threat. Robert's kiddies arrive from abroad, but are upset they have no photo of their mummy, and so sneak out of the safe zone with the Americans in pursuit. Amazingly they find mummy is still alive, and a short time later they're all recaptured and returned to safety.The Americans hose down the mother and tie her to a bench in their military complex. They suspect she's infected but for some reason hasn't gone psycho (she has different coloured eyes, a trait she shares with her son). They take a blood sample, and leave her unattended. Robert uses his caretaker pass card to sneak in, finds her, kisses her on the lips, becomes infected and starts killing people.Realising they have a problem, the military decide to evacuate the British survivors from the safety of the skyscrapers and herd them all into a basement room with an unlocked and unguarded back door. The infected Robert enters and starts attacking them.This was the point where I lost the ability to take any of it seriously. I simply can't believe any military force, American or otherwise, could be that moronic.And so having lost containment the soldiers first shoot down civilians and infected alike, and then later napalm and nerve gas them. There's a humorous bit where the kids and another survivor escape the nerve gas hiding in an airtight abandoned car. And so as they flee the mayhem, Robert the 'super infected' pursues them across London and inexplicably keeps popping up to attack them. The son with the eyes is bitten but doesn't go nuts like his mother (what a surprise!). And it seems the infected have become more like traditional zombies in that they can still walk around with wounds that would kill any human. I won't 'spoil' this any further for you, but suffice it to say I was shouting at the TV in anger by the time it was over.I think this was supposed to be some kind of comment on the American military and the Iraq situation. If so, it failed utterly. It's the film makers that come out looking like idiots.I'd give this a 1, but the first ten minutes were OK and there were a few enjoyable gore sequences.2/10",2,3,6,2 February 2008
The Thing," Just edges out Alien as the finest Sci Fi/Horror film ever made
","This is, and will likely remain, one of my favourite movies. It's as near perfect within it's genre as any movie I've ever seen. The cast, the sets, the script, the special effects: all excellent.To my mind, there are two ways to make a really entertaining horror film. Play it straight, or throw in a heavy element of comedy. This movie plays it straight right down the line, although that's not to say there aren't a few laughs to be had, there are some classic lines of dialogue.The movie's soundtrack and score establish a sense of foreboding from the get go, and as the characters witness one scene of unimaginable horror after another, the fear and paranoia grows palpably. The imagination and thought put into the special effects lifts the movie to a level as yet unsurpassed, Rob Bottin deserved an Oscar for his work here, with an honourable mention going to Stan Winston who stepped in to alleviate the workload, providing a particularly memourable scene.I can't believe I didn't see this at the cinema at the time of it's release. This is partly down to the critics, who should hang their heads in shame for panning this film. But beyond that, the trailer was awful, failing completely to convey the brilliance on display here.Another criticism levelled at this movie is there are no female cast members, but there really wasn't any need for them. The last thing this movie needed is a romantic sub plot.Much as I love Alien, I prefer this. To quote John Carpenter, this monster isn't just some guy in a suit. This is the best of the best.You've probably seen this movie already, but if not and you like horror (particularly of a Lovecraftian flavour), I urge you do so at the earliest opportunity.",10,6,10,27 May 2010
Ratatouille," Thoroughly enjoyable
","I don't mind watching kids animated movies so long as they look good, there's a reasonable story and a few jokes for me to giggle at, and I'm pleased to report this movie scores on all three points.As I'm sure you already know this is about a rat who wants to cook excellent food. The characters are distinctive, delightful and well defined in terms of both animation and voice acting. The animation is as good as anything I've ever seen.If there's a problem, it's that some aspects of the story are a little formulaic in that our heroes 'let each other down a bit and then redeem themselves', which seems to be a standard plot device in animated kids movies these days, and in this case not entirely believable. But what the heck, it's great fun! 9/10",9,1,2,7 March 2008
Aliens," The best Sci Fi action flick ever made
","What can I say that hasn't already been said? Every aspect of this movie is spot on, which I can only put down to James Cameron's obsessive attention to detail. The characters are distinct, memorable and believable. The plot builds slowly into the most tense, suspenseful roller-coaster ride I've ever experienced in the cinema. The special effects are good even by today's standards, and the sets are simply second to none. This is one of my top 10 favourite movies of all time.If you like this kind of movie and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Twenty years on and the only other Sci Fi action movie in the same league is James Cameron's Terminator 2. I can only hope he returns to this genre in the future, he is the master.Oh, and try to see the special extended edition if possible, the extra scenes make an amazing movie even better.",10,100,132,2 February 2008
Pearl Harbor," This movie made me cry and laugh......
","The best thing I can say about this movie was that I was driven to emotional extremes. At some points I was near to tears, and at others laughing hysterically. Problem was not at the points or for the reasons intended by the filmmakers.First of all, if you're going to make a film about a major historical event, do some basic research. There so many ways this story could be well told while sticking to the basic facts, there's no need to insult your audience's intelligence with garbage. There are so many things wrong other reviewers have already documented that I won't bother going over them again here.If you're going to try to introduce a romantic sub plot (which this doesn't need), write a decent story/dialogue or don't bother, particularly if you're incapable of directing these kinds of scenes.Pearl Harbour was a pivotal event in world history, why not examine that aspect rather than following it up with a fictitious exercise in flag waving. I despair.Still, the actual attack sequences looked pretty impressive, so I generously give this a 2/10.",2,3,4,25 May 2010
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Wow, this movie was horrible
","It's rare that I actually get depressed watching a movie, it takes a special kind of bad to do that to me. Previously, it was Highlander II: The Quickening and Stars Wars: The Phantom Menace, and now there is this.This is just painfully bad from the start up to twenty minutes until the end, which I can't comment on because I switched it off at that point. There's only so much torture I can take.One of the most puzzling things to me is who was this movie aimed at? The plot was moronic, contradictory, and had massive continuity errors. The alleged humour infantile in the extreme. And yet the movie had adult content, rendering it unsuitable for the eight-year-olds I'd expect to appreciate this best.Some of the special effects (which I'd hoped would be the movie's saving grace) were so awful they looked like they belonged in a video game.After Pearl Harbour, and this, I shall avoid anything directed by Michael Bay in the future for the sake of my mental well being.",1,1,9,25 May 2010
Signs," Illogical, amoral crap
","The biggest problem with the movie is how ridiculous the plot is, but since this is more of a 'man regains his faith' movie than one about alien invasion I'm going to cover my thoughts on that here.*** Spoilers Follow ***So Mel plays a priest who's struggling with his faith because his wife died in a nasty accident some years earlier. God did this to HIM therefore his faith has wavered, children being murdered in Nazi death camps is absolutely fine. Then some silly plot devices happen that allow him and his family to survive and he finds his faith again. Once again it's all about HIM, screw everyone else. I find this way of thinking morally repugnant.There is no internal logic to this movie. We never get to understand why aliens with the technology to travel to our planet are retards. Read some of the other reviews of this movie if you need elaboration. These aliens make the ones in Battlefield Earth look intelligent.I hate this movie, and only the cinematography and acting raise this to a rating of 2/10.",2,5,9,17 December 2011
