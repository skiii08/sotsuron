Deepwater Horizon," Excellent Portrayal of the BP Disaster
","As usual, Peter Berg does another excellent job keeping the audience involved in his movies. There were a number of individual personal stories and interplay between characters. What was needed was more names and titles as the main characters appeared on screen. It was difficult to hear and understand a lot of dialogue as the movie moved quickly along from scene to scene. It was important to me to know who the 11 who died were while they were on the screen. Having a brief name and title as was done with the lead actors would have helped us relate to those who lost their lives. Or perhaps in the end - show the actors along with the real pictures of the fallen. Great excitement and visual portrayal of a real disaster that should not have occurred. May God bless those who lost their lives. Very emotional in the end.",8,0,2,4 July 2017
Gravity," Who are these people
",Essentially an excellent special effects movie. Beautiful to watch and 3D did nothing to add to film. No character development. We don't really know who they are(Clooney/Bullock). Pretty much all dialogue with a helmet on. At the end of the movie I felt deflated because I didn't know the characters and who they were. Just immediately jump into special effects and a lot of heart pounding but that's it. Poster picture for staying on terra firma.But there needed to be a build up to the accident and a development of the 2 actors in the film so we know have a vested emotional interest. In my theater I became deaf during previews so I may have missed some important dialogue but I doubt it.Wait for video.,7,1,4,10 October 2013
