Airlift," A tale of hope and humanity that breaks all political, societal, religious barriers.
","To be honest Hindi patriotic films have never hit the right notes of my nationalistic sensibilities. With dollops of jingoism and nation-bashing there's not much meat to stimulate one's senses barring few like (in last few years) Rang De Basanti or a Swades: We the People (though that was filled with utopia). Last year's ‪Baby‬ was sleek but predictably linear. And then we have Airlift.Can't believe I watched a film with patriotic undertone which actually didn't play to the gallery. The film might have taken liberties from true events but have depicted things realistically. The plight of the 170000 Indians stranded as refuges in Saddam Hussain's Iraq invaded Kuwait could be felt thanks to Raja Krishna Menon's dexterous execution. The film could easily have swayed to tear-jerking melodrama but Menon's deft handling complimented by some razor sharp writing (Menon himself, Ritesh Shah & Sureah nair) prevented the same. The characterizations and their transitions gelled well with the situations.Technically the film does proved the we are not far behind the west in terms of depicting war-torn cities and Priya Seth gets away with all the brownie points for her cinematography. In a single frame she craft-fully depicted the plight of whole Kuwait city just at the dawn after the dreadful night when Saddam's men attacked it unwarranted. Seth got able support from Hemanti Sarkar whose editing made the film crisp though they could have easily done away with two unnecessary songs in the 2nd half.Vicky Sidana demands attention for his immaculate casting. Inaamulhaq (who won our heart in Filmistaan) perfectly depicted a ghoulish Iraqi general. Always reliable Kumud Mishra's commendable performance as the helpful government official will become memorable for sure while Purab Kohli touches your heart as Ibrahim looking for his love. Prakash Belawadi's complaining Joseph act becomes repetitive but he hold on to the character till the end. Nimrat Kaur scores another century after The Lunchbox. I particularly liked the scene where she (as Ranjeet's wife) confronts Joseph accuses Ranjeet of negligence.Feryna Wazhier made her graceful presence felt without any dialogues. And then there's Akshay Kumar who gave a performance of lifetime as Ranjeet Katiyal, a headstrong businessman who believed he to be more of a Kuwaiti than an Indian and his gradual transformation over the course of events. He played the main protagonist but underplays his superstar image thus giving a believable act that showed his growth as an actor. We wish to see more Special 26, Baby, OMG, Airlift in his career.Having said all the film has its share of flaws as the space was slowing down occasionally in an otherwise taut narrative. Also the scope for some drama had been completely ignored by the makers. The climax is somewhat lame which didn't make the impact needed. May be they wanted to focus more on the incidents that led towards the monumental airlift. Yes, ‪#‎Airlift‬ is indeed a proud historical event which demands respect for all the individuals involved, especially those 488 Air India flights and the two Indians - Manumurthy Matthews and Dr Vedi who were instrumental in getting the balls rolling. As per the film Akshay Kumar's Ranjeet Kaiyal is amalgamation of these two characters. In the end Airlift is a story of triumph..More than that it is a tale of hope and humanity that breaks all political, societal, religious barriers.",Null,0,0,8 February 2016
Rang De Basanti," probably one of the most powerful cinemas of India which created a revolution)
","One of the rare scenario where a film had started a movement. a lot has been said about the film so i will concentrate more on the after effects. India - a country where corruption is sky high and power can even buy you a mother and a whore at the same time it was really commendable to see Indian people getting influenced by the movie to start a movement to give justice to Jessica Lal (who was was shot dead in front of almost 300 stalwarts in the heart land of Delhi by a minister's son). In the RDB way people lit a candle near India Gate and there were thousands of people in the march.The pressure from common man was so strong that government were forced to look into the case which was earlier manipulated by those in the powers..finally justice was given...Now that the power of cinema to start a revolution..that is Rang DE Basanti for you.. Well some friends may not agree with me but i feel we the young India should do the same as done by the character of Siddharth in the movie..Shoot at your father's dick from a point blank range if you find him to be a corrupt politician,businessman,bureaucrat or any stalwart. In this way a new movement can begin.. and coming to the cinema hats off to Rakeysh OmPrakash Mehra for making such a strong comments through his cinema.In a land where staying coward is camouflage with flavors of Non Violence he dared to write a script that shows the spirit of true freedom fighters like Bhagat Singh..and oh boy! in a superb way he interwove the narrative with present youth thus moving the screenplay in a non linear pattern with reflections of past and present. Kudos to whole team of Rang DE Basanti again (a movie which i saw 6 times in the theater only)",Null,2,5,14 January 2011
The Adventures of Tintin," The film doesn't completely work for Tintin loyalists (like me who rates the Tintin Comic Books 11/10)
","Billions of blue blistering barnacles, Ten thousand thundering typhoons – for a whole generation these were the epitome of cuss words thanks to Captain Haddock. I am one of those in late 20s who grew up reading ( mugging to be precise as Thomson & Thompson would have said) Tintin and almost worship Herge for the genius intelligent stories created in the black and white times of our grandpas. Being an hardcore Tintin loyalist the excitement to see the boy sleuth of screen was certainly brewing high. But the movie left me wanting more. It left a mixed reaction in me and here I come one by one at different levels.Story Level – Hollywood have adapted many novels for big screen and most of the times it has failed to recreate the finesse of the original work. Spielberg's rendition of Tintin somehow managed a mixed reaction in terms of story. Firstly selecting 'The Crab with the Golden Claws' make sense as that shows the boy sleuth meeting the gold hearted Captain Haddock for the first time and in the first encounter Tintin comes face to face with the perennial drinking habit of Captain. 'The crab with the golden claws' had enough spice for a full fledged film but may be Spielberg wanted some adventure which prompted him to juggle with 'The secret of the unicorn' and 'the crab with the golden claws' thus making a concatenation of two stories. Personally I felt that the two stories have been woven wisely with liberty taken in creating an ancestral fight between Captain Francis Haddock and Pirate Red Rackham. Somehow the cocktail was well crafted with the story oscillating between two original books. But the second half was outright outlandish as Spielberg merges his own imagination in creating a full fledged action film which took away the essence of Tintin. The subtlety, intelligence were missing as the director chose to make a 80s Bollywoodish action climax which had no connection to the original one. Moreover the movie ended in the way the comic book 'Red Rackham's Treasure' ends yet Spielberg hinted a sequel which is related to Red Rackham's treasure. That shows the sequel will be a total new story by Spielberg (or Peter Jackson) with touches of original. It will be strictly for those who have no idea of what actual Tintin is all about. I mean Spilberg could have named it anything Tom Dick and Harry if not Tintin specially for the second half.Character Level – Spielberg is almost perfect in designing the characters. The look and the way the screen Tintin reacts brings in nostalgia of childhood days when we imagined (and discussed amongst friends) how Tintin would have behaved if made on screen. The attire to expression was all nicely done. Same goes for Snowy, the cute loyal dog of Tintin who can fight with the goons to save his beloved master. In fact children will fall in love with Snowy after watching this film. In one of the scene when Tintin gets kidnapped Snowy follows the car of the goons to the ship were Tintin was deported. The scene indeed brings out the pathos and concern inside Snowy for his master. Coming to Captain Haddock the characterization isn't as perfect as the comic book. The laziness and craziness in the first half were apt but then Captain fighting in the second half is too hard to digest. The detective duo Thompson and Thomson is appropriate and so is famous nightingale singer Bianca Castaphiore. But Spielberg should have included the verbal fights between Castaphiore and Haddock though he hinted Haddock and Snowy's disgust for Castaphiore's opera. Coming to the villains I am not convinced of Sachcharin as the main villain. The original had Bird Brothers as the villain duo which was more convincing than the screen one. In fact if they wanted to include a dreaded notorious villain then Rastapopulous (the evergreen big nosed enemy of Tintin) would have been the right choice. Even malicious Captain Allan has been relegated to side kick of Sachcharin. Captain Francis Haddock and Red Rackham's characters were true to the original book and it worked well.Technical Level :- Frankly speaking the 3D effects were disappointing though the animation was top notch. The shadows and the structures created the by gone era with utmost precision. The fight sequence between Captain Francis Haddock and Red Rackham was one of the best sequences in the film. With brilliant camera-work and fine editing the scenes looked captivating on screen. Thought the fight sequences in the climax were loud for Tintin purist but at technical level those are a treat to watch and would be lapped by those who don't have a clue of 'actual' Tintin. Dialogues were plain pedestrian and thanks to morality lectures by Captain it becomes ridiculous as a Tintin loyalist to sit through in the second half. As a director Spielberg has lost his midas touch long back which is echoed by this film again.As a whole Adventure of Tintin started of brilliantly but lost its true sense with faulty narrative towards later half. Tintin loyalists would feel cheated but then they would still watch it for Nostalgia. Non-Tintin fans would lap it for the action. But believe me the Belgian reporter who resides in the heart of millions deserve a better on-screen representation thus doing justice to original masterpiece created by genius Herge. Whatever may be the fate of Spielberg's Tintin please go and read the original comic series. Each is brilliant in it's own way..On-screen or off-screen Tintin and Snowy rocks!! Tintin the film 6/10..Tintin the comic book 11/10",Null,57,86,21 December 2011
The Intouchables," A toast to the spirit of Living .. A must watch film for all
","This is the story of friendship between a quadriplegic (Phillipe) and his black attendant (Driss). At the surface one has the impression that the film will be a tearjerker with oodles of sentimental scenes coming one after another. Being from India and having witnessed such films of dying person or disability which are meant to titillate the sentiment of the weak to my mind I perceived one that of a contrived, loud, excessively melodramatic 'Gujarish' which was also about a quadriplegic person. But as I started watching it how I wished to see such a film being made in India. The movie is a lesson to live life with full vigour amidst adversities. The film starts with two persons in car with one in the wheel driving it crazily through the busy roads of France when they are stopped by the police. Driss challenges Philippe that the policemen wouldn't arrest him but on the contrary would escort them. Thus they put a bet of 200Euros.Driss faked a drama about how he was taking quadriplegic Philippe to hospital for emergency and thus he had no option but to opt for rash driving. They succeeded in creating guilt amongst the policemen thus assuring them to escort Phillipe's car. As they start the car again there is an immediate smile in my face that this will be film full of life. From there the movie goes back to where the hiring process is on for a caretaker. Driss, an outlaw leaving in the black community of suburbs took the job. Unlike the other caretakers Philippe become connected to Driss easily because of the Driss's lack of sympathy towards him. In fact the film works at this level which makes us feel that people with certain problem needs affection rather than sympathy. Driss is an outlaw, rude and brutally honest and somehow there seem to be a connection with Phillipe who is a rich loner losing his lower half to an accident. The zeal for life is still there but the support is missing. From having food to shower to everything he needs someone else's 'hands' not out of sympathy but out of compassion and he found it in Driss. Driss on the other hand learns the art of living from Phil's quadriplegic existence. He learns to respect life, family and more than that Himself. He gains confidence in life and tries to induce that to Phillipe by trying to re-marry him to his lady love. The climax is one of the best I have seen in recent times. It is honest, sweet, touching yet there is no forced melodrama. The simplicity brings down tears of happiness as we learn the real characters that inspired the reel version are living a happy contended life overcoming their individual short comings at physical as well as psychological level. There have been several films on friendship between a black and white but there is nothing contrived in the plot. Director duo Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano's intention is as pure as the friendship portrayed.Their success lies in their usage of subtle humour to tell this touching story.The wide angle of camera reflects a contentment which the protagonist is having with his surroundings. The gradual bonding has been kept subtle with small sequences like Driss taking Phillipe to open air around 3am and then offering cigarette. These are the small things which help in taking the bigger step. The usage of light has been apt as the shade gradually shifts towards brighter shade. Dorian's editing gels with the character transformations. The long cuts in the initial reels changed to short cuts reflecting the happiness and youthful exuberance within. Ludovico's soft background score suits the mood of the film. The occasional use of orchestra uplifts the mood after prolonged calmness which fits Phillipe's characterization. François Cluzet and Omar Sy as Phillipe and Driss respectively are flawless. Veteran actor Cluzet fits in perfectly as Phillipe and brings out the hopelessness yet the desire to live with perfect conviction. The clumsiness of a quadriplegic comes from his mannerism. And then there is the young talent Sy whose comic timings are more than perfect. His range of expression helps in showing the change in the curve of his character as he softens down on his basic mannerisms. His initial mockery to the aristocratic existence, to his understanding of their behaviour and thus a change in his own expressions are put across with perfection. 'Intouchables' celebrates life and the reason it works is one can identify with the basic emotion. Someway we all are saddled in our existence fighting all odds and struggling to overcome adversities of life. This film brings in hope; it throws light to the darkness in our existence. It teaches us to love through tales of true friendship, a virtue that is losing its value in this materialistic existence. It tells us to believe in our strength and never lose hope which we tend to even in minor setbacks. Without trying to sympathise on bygones the film subtly teaches to look forward and use every precious moment of our life to be happy. The movie is a must watch for everyone who can breathe. P.S : This year a great tragedy happened in my life for which I was mentally down. But this movie really helped me to have faith in life and all to a certain extend. I really want to thanks the director duo for making this film",Null,19,29,20 July 2012
The Artist," It could have been a better experience, nevertheless it is a good film
","If you want to create something different, irrespective of good or bad you need to experiment. In world of cinema Experiment has been a perennial process thus cinema lovers witness beyond monotonousness of typicality. Hopefully Indian audience will be accepting more such attempts so that young intelligent directors and can experiment and surprise us like their foreign counterparts. Coming to the main topic, 'The Artist' is one such exceptionally captivating experiment where by director Michel Hazanavicius recreated the silent era of Hollywood almost successfully. Story-wise it's a simple and linear tale of fall & rise with an overtly positive ending. It tells the story of George Valentin (brilliantly played by Jean Dujardin) ,a fictional reigning star of silent era of Hollywood. The film begins at the genesis of talking era with artist involving the silent era on verge of creative destruction. In such a scenario the pride of George led him to further downfall thus leaving him with his loyal pet (played by now famous dog Uggy) and a chauffeur. While in his peak days he found a talent in form of Peppy Miller (played by Berenice Bejo) who later became a superstar of early talkie cinema. Though Miller tries to help George for a grand comeback it is the ego and self destructing reflection of inner self that protest unnecessarily thus heading to a chaotic dissolution. Michel Hazanavicius story and screenplay is fairly linear and had it's share of cliché parts. The ending is forcefully optimistic which doesn't gel with the mood of the protagonist. Being French himself it is expected that he would avoid the complexities of Hollywood silent films and simply concentrate more on the lead than the surroundings. But Michel Hazanavicius' direction is better than his screenplay with an eye for technical details of the by-gone era from aspect ratio of the picture to the costume of each actor. Schiffman's cinematography is captivating with an elevating musical score by Ludovic Bource. Teaming up with Anne-Sophie Bon, the director did a splendid job in the editing department keeping the film crisp and concise. Mark Bridges' costume and set design set the mood for the period film. When talking about 'The artist' one cannot give a full stop until they talk about Durajin and Uggy. In an era of talkies Durjardin gave a superlative performance with his expressions telling thousand words. He has the capability to play with eyes as well as the whole face same time and thus generating basket full of expressions. And there is Uggie- the wonder dog whose expressions were as brilliant as the human actors. The sequence were George plays with the pistol to shoot himself and the way 'Uggie' reacts to it biting the trousers of George and helplessly staring to hold him from pulling the trigger, deserves special mention. Bejo as Miller has the charm and aura to be a superstar and she portrayed that with perfection. Her vulnerability in the later reels are well established. John Goodman (one of Coen Brothers favorites) is in full form expectantly as Al Zimmer, the producer of Kinograph Studios. Cromwell as chauffeur Clifton is efficient. During the initial credits I saw Malcom McDowell and was expecting a meaty role but was surprised to see him in a blink-and-you miss appearance. Overall The Artist is an extraordinary experiment with flaws. It could be a path breaking film if director had written the script with reduced clichés and less consciousness on making the juries of award(s) contended. But still it deserves the required applause for the technically effusive attempt. In fact the symbiotic relationship between George and his dog reminded me of another classic Vittorio De Sica's Umberto D.",Null,0,2,7 June 2012
Rockstar," An awesome piece of Art by Imtiaz Ali
","Indian cinema has matured and specially Hindi film with new directors pouring in with new ideas. Anurag Kashyap, Dibakar Banerjee, Vishal Bhardwaj should get special mention for their brilliant coming of age films. After Rockstar, Imtiaz Ali should be added to this category of filmmakers. Romantic cinema is immortal perennial but never ever it has been witnessed in such creative, symbolic, real manner as in Rockstar. Rockstar is journey of Janarthan, a regular north Delhi brat who dreams of becoming Jim Morrison. He even tries to match his initials with the famous singer and tries to change his fate. Alas! He couldn't succeed in making a mark when a college canteen owner (who becomes family for Janarthan later on) Khataria tells him that through pain comes music. Janarthan took his word too seriously thus involving in a web of suffering and success all revolving around Heer, a lady who becomes life for Janarthan rather Jordan. The movie is a journey of a young ambitious boy from his being Janarthan to Jordan and in a symbolic manner raises several questions about independence and democracy. Imtiaz Ali is a fabulous story teller and his previous work reflects those but with Rockstar he goes a level higher. The film will bring polarizing reactions from cine goers but they can't ignore it. Probably one of the best romantic cinemas ever made. Ali is almost flawless in his execution. With a semi non-linear narrative Ali goes into the psyche of Jordan merging his scenario pre and post success. The scene where Jordan cries in front of Khataria that he doesn't need all the fame he wants to be Happy – sums up Jordan's strive with his impression. The rebel has been created in a thought provoking manner raising questions to establishment. The rules set in the society, the willingness to live freely, how power has destroyed the regular course of nature – all these ideas have been embedded subtle in a brilliant love story that is natural unlike loud melodramatic blockbusters of regular Hindi cinema. When Jordan is almost losing Heer forever there is a scene which shows Jordan in a bath tub looking at his guitar on fire which reflects the life of present youth who tends to burn (loss) everything one loves in course of success. There are many more such brilliant sequences which show Ali's craftsmanship as a director. With able support from Anil Mehta the camera work is probably the best of this year. Ali didn't compromise for commerce and gave a surreal feel to the real proceedings. Kudos to Aarti Bajaj for her apt editing and making the film a work of art. Coming to the acting department, Ranbir Kapoor rocks. He camouflaged himself as Jordan with élan. Rockstar will prove how fine actor he is. In fact the new brigade of actors should take acting lessons from Ranbir. Watch his transition from Janarthan to Jordan, his success his failures his love his despair – Ranbir's expression deserves awards and accolades. Teaming up with fabulous actors like Piyush Mishra, Kumud Mishra (who was last seen in brilliant 'That girl in yellow boots') Ranbir showed extreme maturity. In a sequence where he tore down a contract and made hysteric gestures towards Piyush Mishra deserves standing ovation. Those dialogues showing Ali's angst against consumerism deserves mention. Nargis Fakhri as Heer is serene beauty. Any boy will fall in love with her. As an actress she needs to improve but then she isn't bad either. Piyush Mishra as the opportunist Dhingra simply rocks as usual. Kumud Mishra is surely to catch attention of other directors. The ensemble cast provides ample support in their brief and significant role. Lastly how can one forget the original Rockstar Late Shammi Kapoor in a significant appearance. As a successful classical Sahnai (flute) player he is mind blowing. And how can I forget about Rehman's music in the film. Each of the songs are mark of a genius and brilliant in their own space. With awesome lyrics from Irshad Kamil the musical score elevates the movie to another level. 'Nadan parinday' is one of the best written songs of recent times and 'Sadda Haq' had all the power to be the youth anthem. Simply brilliant album in every sense. Overall Rockstar is a outstanding work of art that might not appeal to every many but sure to be the next Kagaz ke Phool in the long run; though Rockstar is already a Hit. Thankfully a genuine honest effort deserved its box office report. A classic in the long runRockstar Rocks!!",Null,8,10,21 December 2011
