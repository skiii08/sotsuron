Ali," A FINE FILM
","I just purchased my copy of this film and watched it for the first time last night.This is a finely made film.I am a fan of just about everybody associated in the making of it.Will Smith,who I might add, actually deserved the recognition he received from the Academy as a nominee this year for best actor for his outstanding delivery of Muhammad Ali.Jon Voight,as usual,gives another unforgettable performance.I also found Mario Van Pebbles as Malcom X and Mykelti Williamson as Don King,both quite convincing.I almost didn't recognize Jada Pinkett Smith for a while,but she was quite good,having never seen her in such a mature role as this one.Others have spoken about how NOT this movie is about boxing,yet a look at the man Muhammad Ali,himself.His beliefs,his romantic interests,love for his religion,his comical interviews for the broadcast media.We are even shown his reflections on humanity and human injustices where he' s given an early lesson as a young boy riding in the 'colored' section in the rear of a bus.We see in this picture a Muhammad Ali who wants and needs to be a voice,a leader for the people,for black people.He proves this in his refusal of being inducted into military service,his choice not to fight in a war in Vietnam against a people he feels are of no threat to him,but rather a race of people who are suffering just like the oppressed in America.I am a Vietnam vet and I surely can understand his reasoning here,even though I went on to fight in that war.I enjoyed watching this movie and plan on watching it many more times.One thing that rather disturbed me about the film was the sound.I don't know if there are others here who have watched it at home and heard it through a surround sound system,but I found it difficult hearing dialogue at times.I kept adjusting my speakers but couldn't seem to find the right speaker level combo.At times the soundtrack was louder than the actors speaking.I wonder if anyonelse had this problem?All in all this again is a fine film.",Null,0,0,20 August 2002
Training Day," This Has Got To Be Denzel's Year
","Denzel Washington has given us a different look at his acting capabilities.The majority of his films give us a decent man,who stands for right,and goes the distance in proving this.This time Denzel shows he can make us believe he is as rotten,cruel,and selfish as they come.And I believe in his character as Alonzo Harris,as crooked a policeman most anyone would ever care to know.He portrays this wicked officer to the hilt.A cop who cares very little about the well being of his kid and the mother of his child,or needless to say his sworn oath to preserve and protect as a civil servant of the police force.Before this movie,if anyone would have told me I would someday be watching one of his films where I would feel his death was justified,I would have thought they were crazy.This can only speak for the outstanding performance he has delivered in this motion picture.So much of what we see of him this time only proves he is indeed a great actor.A great actor,who has been slighted a time or two at the Oscars.Others might not agree with me,but I feel he was overlooked for his fine performance in 'The Crimson Tide'.Denzel should have at least been a nominee that year,in my opinion.If he doesn't receive best actor for this one this time,I feel like Julia Roberts,but I'll take it a bit further.The academy should discontinue giving out yearly awards,especially when excellent actors like Denzel are far too often loosing out to others who gave lesser performances.I believe if he looses this time,not just myself but a great deal of movie fans will be taken back to the 80's when Steven Spielberg's 'The Color Purple' walked away empty handed,after capturing 11 nominations that year,and received not even one.Truly unjust.",10,3,15,20 March 2002
