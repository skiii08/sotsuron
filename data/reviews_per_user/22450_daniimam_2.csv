Captain Phillips," Captain Phillips is one of the best biographies of the last decade
","Captain Phillips was a really well made film. I thought the run time was a bit long but majority of the scenes did matter. Tom hanks as always steals the show, the ending scene of when he comes to safety is absolutely heartbreaking, I can only imagine what he felt in real life, being held hostage and beaten. I highly recommend this movie if you're into the hijacking kind of movies or if you're into biographies, this movie represents something important and has a great meaning. I very much enjoyed this film and I would watch it again.Thank you for your time.",8,1,1,29 September 2019
Joker," This is how DC movies should be made
","This movie blew me away. I was very hyped and excited for it, but I kept myself distant from the trailers and clips. Joaquin Phoenix is a now certified LEGENDARY actor!!! Jesus he was amazing in this movie, and delivers probably the greatest solo acting performance since heath ledger in the dark knight. I will admit the movie was a bit slow but I was easy to forgive since this is a character study kind of movie and it does say a lot about society. I won't go into deep specifics in this review but you'll know when you see it. I thought the cinematography was stunning of a run down Gotham City, the score was thrilling and mesmerizing. I can't get it out of my head, I just simply can't. I highly highly recommend this movie if you favor great acting and if you want your mind to be blown. Thank you for your time.",10,14,28,6 October 2019
