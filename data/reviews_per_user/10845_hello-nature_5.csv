The Ring," So 'scary' it was funny.
",This has got be one of the biggest disappointments I have ever had in terms of a movie not meeting my expectations.  Normally any movie above 8.0 on IMDB with over 100 voters is guaranteed to be great. I was expecting big things.  I could not believe how bad the acting was right off the bat - it looked like a horror comedy.  It was so bad the audience was pretending to scream and then laughing because the scene was so phoney.  There were a couple of good scenes in it that were impressive like the horse falling off the ferry but there were so many bad ones and the story was so unexplained - that it was a relief when the movie ended.  I am utterly astounded at the rating of this movie - I think it must have been a conspiracy to pump up the ratings because I cannot explain how about 1400 people could give it an 8.2 rating - that means 35% of the voters gave it a 10 out of 10.  Are they insane?  My confidence in this rating scheme has been shattered...,2,0,0,24 October 2002
The Day After Tomorrow," The Day After the Critics ...
","So, whats with the critics?  I was working out and listening to cbc (Canada public radio) and this movie was getting wasted.  I took my son to Shrek 2 and it was sold out so in we went.  I loved it.  Yes it has flaws as they all do; who would have thunk a crack in the antarctic ice field would split a few tents right in half.  But the scenes were amazing.  There were even a few human relationship moments - the critics said there were none.  I loved it when Mexico closed the border to Americans and the Dick Cheney look-alike had to eat his words over global warming.  Hollywood is getting their kick at the right wing arrogance that is in power currently in the US.  The president was much more reasonable and looked like Al Gore.  One thing that Hollywood does that drives me crazy is the main protagonist couple always has to be good looking and professional.  Can't there ever be any Mr. and Mrs. Average protagonists?  For artists, these writers so lack imagination.Anyway, its well done and well worth going to see.  Trrrrust me.....",8,0,0,28 May 2004
The Butterfly Effect," As intense as your worst ice cream headache.
",I am not a technical critic - I just go on how emotionally involved I was and how entertained.  I was right into this movie. I loved it. I was thoroughly entertained.  I was there.  I was this guy trying to figure my way out of the time maze and the traps that started to repeat themselves. It ended up on a ________ note and I could ________.,10,0,3,23 January 2004
The Pianist," You become part of the story
",I reserve my best ratings for movies that pull you in right away and keep you there.  This is one of them.  A must see.  It is about the occupation of Poland by the Germans and the ordeal one man goes through to survive.  He sees his family taken away to the gas chambers and bodies of little children in the street are common place.  Its an unbelievable world but one that still exists in many parts of the world today.,10,1,3,9 April 2003
The Mummy Returns," This movie should be wrapped in bandages ....
","This is the worst movie I have seen in some time.  My excuse for going to see it is I didn't see the first one.   I rarely get itchy feet while at a movie but 15 minutes into this one I started wondering how long it was going to be.  There is no character development.This movie certainly proves that special effects don't make a movie. The effects were great but when you don't have a connection, its like watching something cool for a few minutes then its time to leave.  The characters are all artificial, superficial, two dimensional things that don't behave in any way approaching a normal person.  The man and woman are either in gut wrenching danger or kissing.  And even the kissing was boring since there is no build up - its like, ok, can we have a kiss - camera, action - its a take.  Yawn!!!!",1,6,10,14 May 2001
