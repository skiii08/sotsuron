First Man," It's a bit meh.....
","There were parts of this film I enjoyed and parts that sent me to sleep. Literally as I fell asleep half way through on a transatlantic flight to the USA :). Overall I wanted more, but the camerawork for me wasn't great and the acting a snooze fest. Given a choice I'd rathe watch The Right Stuff followed by Apollo 13.",5,1,2,10 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Tragic end of a saga
","When the original Star Wars came out it was simply amazing, the next two films were also brilliant in their way. The next three films - prequels if you like followed a different path but to me were highly enjoyable despite some of the flaws.Then came episodes 7-9, GL had sold out to Disney and the franchise handed over to directors and scriptwriters who again tried to advance the story to what in all intents and purposes was a cross between botched reboot and a woeful facsimile of the original films.In this latest and final instalment, the same weak and utterly confused storyline was extrapolated to it's inevitable conclusion, although it probably should have been called Rise of Palpatine since it transpired that the major character was the granddaughter of Emperor Palpatine (who had somehow managed to resurrect himself).This was one of many plot twists or exposes ranging from horse-like creatures charging across a star destroyer, love interests randomly thrown in from out of nowhere. Leia in reference to the fan-fiction that followed the original trilogy, suddenly exposing herself as a Jedi Knight oh and then voluntarily following Luke into a green-glowy existence to save Rey. A very fat and wooden Lando Calrission, entering from stage right, ghosts of Han and Luke appearing to help out every now and again - what an absolute tripe-ridden and confused ending to the series.Comedy interest as usual come from C3PO and frankly this was the best performance in the film. Sadly this is about the only good thing I can say about the film except perhaps that it was less tedious than episode 8 and had all the usual special effects that we have come to take for granted. Nods were given to past characters, with an obligatory show of Ewoks celebrating the evil empires downfall (again). Hell they even threw in a pointless lesbian kiss at that point for good measure (why??????).As a Star Wars fan since the first movie, I felt obliged to go see the film, but also I feel saddened by the utter corruption of the series which really can be summarised as follows:Ep 1 : Sowing the seeds of the Empire and Darth Vader
Ep 2 : Start of the Clone Wars
Ep 3 : Rise of the Empire, Palpatine and Darth Vader
Ep 4 : Start of Luke story and the Rebel Alliance, Death Star #1 is blown up
Ep 5 : Luke's journey to becoming a Jedi
Ep 6 : Destruction of Palpatine and the end of the Empire, Death Star #2 is blown up
Ep 7 : Who knows but there is some kind of Death Star again, gets blown up
Ep 8 : Hell hath no fury like a long drawn out space chase
Ep 9 : A thousand Death Stars each mounted on the ass of a Star Destroyer, they all gets blown away!Enjoy (if you can)!",3,18,28,30 December 2019
Top Secret!," Utter Tripe
","I know it's a spoof but, it's very out of date for 2018 and anyone born after Germany's unification probably won't get it.",1,5,20,31 May 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," Great movie with slight inaccuracies
","Saw this on a flight to the US, enjoyable film that holds little back regarding his life. I've always liked films that mixed music with the content but which are not musicals if that makes sense but you would expect that here of course and it delivers in spades for any Queen fan. Freddie's life as a gay man is covered without being too overwhelming or in bad taste and it is clearly intrinsic to the story throughout. Rated a nine as it portrays a few things that are historically wrong but I suspect were done that way to avoid gaps in the story that would otherwise have occurred with the film ending with Live Aid.Have to say the Live Aid scenes far exceeded expectations and having sat through the entire concert when I was younger bought back memories of that amazing event. Overall it's a must-watch for Queen fans.",9,0,1,10 March 2019
Dunkirk," Bit of a letdown
","I was expecting a lot from this film based on the reviews but walked away puzzled and disappointed. Where, for example, was the amazing score that people had mentioned, I knew there wasn't much dialogue, but where was the acting to compensate? Anyway reviews are in the eye of the beholder but to me this simply wasn't a great film for me, and insulting to the troops who were largely portrayed as selfish cowards.",5,3,4,28 April 2018
Avengers: Infinity War," A little of everything, makes for an average affair
","I've enjoyed most of the Marvel Universe films but I wasn't as taken with this, basically a little of everyone's favourite characters, but equally not enough of everyone's favourite characters combined to make a slightly less than memorable movie.One thing though, this was a movie with a message that humanity cannot continue wasting the resources of this planet or face the loss of at least half of what we have on this little planet of ours. Credit for that as we need to wake up to a very harsh future if we carry on as is.",6,1,1,27 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Reminded me of Jackie Brown
","Saw this on a flight to the USA, having got used to QTs gory style, this one seemed closer to the style of Jackie Brown. Solid story of Hollywood life, good supporting cast - two stories in one really. The film ended is a more recent QT style with plenty of gore and a nice flamethrower for added value.Not his best work, but still good.",8,1,1,29 February 2020
