Frost_Nixon," Frost/Nixon is a taut, entertaining dramatisation with strong performances and an accomplished period aura
","When watching films based on true events, my propensity for doubting what I see on screen is instantly heightened. The main thing that I found suspect was the extent to which Nixon was constructed as a villain. During the film he is shown to be deceptive, racist, lecherous and a man unashamedly motivated by money. The film does add favourable depth to the character in places, making the viewer pity him in some respects, but generally Nixon doesn't fare well at all. I don't know enough about the man to accurately comment on the film's portrayal of him, but I did find the characterisation somewhat dubious.Furthermore, upon researching the interviews, I read that David Frost's experience was different to what's seen in the film. According to his partner Caroline Cushing, he didn't fret endlessly over his performances with Nixon, he was quite content with each of the interviews. So, like many films 'inspired by true events', the film takes liberties with the facts. However, this doesn't matter to the viewer, for the artistic licence makes for a great piece of dramatisation. The film is quite a gruelling experience; the pressure in and out of the interviews is intense. For a film that concerns conversations, it is quite remarkable how compelling and uncomfortable it is. The wars of words and mind games are more engrossing than any boxing match in 'Raging Bull' or 'The Fighter'. The film's chief merit lies in its performances. Martin Sheen sounds and even looks exactly like David Frost, it is quite uncanny. And whilst not meeting the likeness achieved by Sheen, Frank Langella is equally as captivating as Nixon. Also, Kevin Bacon gives a good, typical Kevin Bacon performance as Jack Brennan, the officious aide to the President.Frost/Nixon is a taut, entertaining dramatisation with strong performances and an accomplished period aura.www.hawkensian.com",8,1,1,1 December 2012
Fury," Its climactic scene descends into Rambo territory, however outside of this David Ayer's Fury contains some impressively loud and brutal scenes of warfare.
","I had been eagerly anticipating Fury, I had faith in it as director David Ayer proved his skill in creating searingly intense action sequences in End of Watch (2012), a film that had a palpable sense of danger. Despite Fury following a tank crew during WW2, I don't think it matched End of Watch's pervasive sense of looming peril, as the latter had a hyperrealism and an urban environment more familiar to me than a battleground, thank goodness.The film opens with several lines of text explaining the situation, it's simple but rather chilling, informing the viewers that it's April 1945 and that the German defence is the most 'fanatical' the Allies have encountered in the European theatre.Fury follows a tank crew comprising Don 'Wardaddy' Collier (Brad Pitt), a battle hardened veteran of North Africa and Europe; Norman Ellison (Logan Lerman) a timid rookie with only 8 weeks' training as a typist; Boyd 'Bible' Swan (Shia LaBeouf), the clichéd zealously religious southerner; Trini 'Gordo' Garcia (Michael Pena) and Grady 'Coon-Ass' Travis (Jon Bernthal), a genuinely hateful, obnoxious, rancid Neanderthal who regularly boiled my blood.Fury's chief merit is its war scenes. The film features some excellent sound engineering, which was delivered to me by Vue's thunderingly loud sound system. Be prepared for the frenzied chatter of MG42s, the sudden, reverberating boom of artillery fire and the piercing shriek of tank shells ricocheting. The instantaneous, ceaseless death is executed well, men's lives end forever left, right and centre in the most brutal fashion, whether it's death by headshot, fire, explosives or tank tracks – it's anonymous slaughter on a massive scale. Like any combat-intensive war film should do, Fury leaves you feeling battered, however its power is unfortunately hindered by its stupid concluding battle.With publicity photos of Brad Pitt posturing meanly with his cool hair, I had worried that Fury would be a Brad Pitt vehicle, a film in which Pitt is a gunslinging B-movie war hero instead of a real soldier. I felt my fears were being confirmed when in the first minute or so Pitt jumps off a tank and launches himself at a man on horseback, knocking him down and vehemently stabbing him in the eyes; however his Rambo emulation was generally kept at bay until the film's final battle, where his character and indeed the whole film goes awry.War films and the moralising that comes with some can so easily become hackneyed, and there are times where the dialogue veered very closely to the trite 'war is hell' territory with lines such as 'You'll soon know what a man can do to another man.' delivered portentously and too early in the film by Gordo.Characterisation also suffered from tired conventions at times; although LaBeouf went method actor for his character (he cut his face and pulled one of his teeth out), he rather wasted his commitment, as Boyd 'Bible' Swan is the tiringly familiar southern drawling preacher that, according to cinema, was present in every platoon. Saving Private Ryan was also guilty of this with Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), the stylishly ultra-accurate, cross-kissing sniper. Indeed, the areas that these characters hail from constitute the most religious region of the United States, their presence I suppose is entirely plausible, however I think they stink of stock character.The worst instance of engagement breaking clichéd tosh happens at the beginning of the film's final scene, in which the heroic Wardaddy decides to fight a much, much larger SS division that possess both vehicles and a comprehensive arsenal of weapons. Initially, the men protest it, but of course one by one they declare that 'I'm stayin'!' I did much head shaking during this moment. Despite these brushes with cliché however, I felt that Fury didn't become a serious offender.There's a protracted scene in which Wardaddy and Norman seek refuge in the apartment of a German mother and daughter. Initially, the scene is wrought with tension as you don't know the battle-hardened Wardaddy's intentions; rape of German women was commonplace, particularly by Soviet troops during and after the Battle of Berlin. However the scene eventually becomes overlong and rather misguided, the ambiguous tension is lost long before the expected payoff or denouement, a variety of which never arriving.And now to the aforementioned final battle scene. I have read numerous arguments defending the scene's credibility, however the reasoning is invariably flimsy – demonstrably, the scene is very flawed indeed. I have heard some remarkable stories of bravery from WW2, the most recent one being Robert Cain (Jeremy Clarkson's father-in-law). Major Cain had been driven to a frenzy during Operation Market Garden, resigning himself to death and managing to disable or destroy six tanks using his deft skill with a 6-pounder anti-tank gun and, believe it or not, a two-inch mortar fired from his hip. Cain somehow survived the ordeal, winning a Victoria Cross for his gallantry. Despite such stories, there are just too many holes in Fury's last standoff; it's a lazily written stain on the film that breaks the momentum of the electrifying collection of war scenes that preceded it.71%www.hawkensian.com",7,1,5,10 November 2014
Monster," A torturous, depressing biography with an uncannily accurate lead performance.
","What a tortured life this woman led; a life of inferiority, confusion, violence, victimisation, prostitution, anger and ultimately, murder. Charlize Theron's utter transformation is what drives this film, her performance and physical emulation perfectly conveying the desperate pain and impetuous anger of her character. I think the Oscars are not much more than a smug festival of self-celebration, but this performance deserved commendation. 'Monster' is the story of Aileen Wuornos, a prostitute from Florida who murdered seven men between 1989 and 1990. One might think that the film's title would suggest otherwise, but the film gives a very human representation of Wuornos. She was indeed a 'monster' in her final years, but the film's emphasis on the brutal, relentless path that led to her first killing shows the architecture of such a creation. But not for a second, I hasten to add, does the film condone her violence, she isn't glorified and she isn't vilified either, the film is so very downbeat and visceral that it would be impossible for anyone to be allured by it. 'Monster' is by no means the tale of one woman standing up against chauvinist pigs; her tale of nature, nurture and the consequences of violence is impartially told. The film reflects on Wurnos' childhood, a time of sexual favours, inadequacy, rape and beatings. A narrative gap, which misses a dubious failed marriage and numerous arrests, presents the viewer with a sorry picture, a woman who washes in petrol station toilets, a woman who is desperately trying to survive. She then meets a companion, the vulnerable Selby Moore. It's at this point that the film strays from the facts; 'Selby Moore' is a fictional character, very loosely based, especially in appearance, to Tyria Moore, Wuornos' lover until her execution. The pair, who have moved in together, live off Wuornos' prostitution wage until their relationship is complicated by Moore's discovery of Wuornos' taste for violence. The film depicts the first murder as Wuornos described it -self defence. Her first victim was Richard Mallory, a convicted rapist. Aileen stated that he raped and savaged her, so she shot him. I think her claim has credibility; it's quite possible that Mallory thought Wuornos was expendable social underclass, an easy thrill without consequence. I respect that the scene was orchestrated in this manner. Monster is a stark and balanced insight into the frankly miserable life of Aileen Wuornos. You may not like her and all the violence will most likely strain your empathy, but I think you'll leave the film having a greater understanding of her.www.hawkensian.com",8,0,1,9 August 2012
Inglourious Basterds," 'Inglourious Basterds' is an entertaining, original war film with high production values
","'Inglourious Basterds' is not a film to be taken seriously, it's a farce. Firstly, many of its characters are caricatures, especially Brad Pitt's role Lieutenant Aldo Raine, who speaks in an exaggerated southern drawl. Secondly, the story completely rewrites history in grand, bloody fashion. Overall, I found the film to be good fun; I found its total disregard for history to be refreshing. It has been called 'juvenile', to those people I say 'lighten up'. Its characters, context and plotting seem to have annoyed many people. The majority of the negative reviews I have read on IMDb are unfair and written by people who are cine-illiterate and sometimes downright illiterate. To dislike this film is understandable, but to give it 1/10 is immature and makes their opinion completely invalid. Many will find it distasteful, and it is, the German soldiers aren't considered people by the Basterds; some deserve their violent treatment, others do not. However, contrary to popular belief, the film isn't crammed full of violence. It certainly has graphic outbursts, but it isn't pervasive. Instead, much of the film consists of dialogue delivered by its strong cast, constructing its rather large, multi- character story. The main acting credit of course goes to Christoph Waltz, whose turn as the intelligent, ruthless and utterly inescapable Col. Hans Landa is a highlight of the film. There are moments that are removed from the farcical features of the film, notably the tense farm house interrogation and the basement bar scene, both of which are superbly constructed and acted. Think 'The Lives of Others' only with characters that face far more brutal consequences (if not as dramatically affecting.) I quite like the film's story and plotting, it's a long film but I didn't grow tired of it like some people have. I didn't expect the film to incorporate so many characters, I didn't expect its scope. It's interesting to wonder what the film would've been like if it had adopted a 'Reservoir Dogs' approach, it could have been a stripped down thriller that closely followed the Basterds' exploits, it may well have been a better film. Instead it's more related to 'Pulp Fiction', a lengthy film with many characters and a marked tone of black humour, however 'Inglorious Basterds' isn't as funny or as interesting. Tarantino's methods of film-making are questionable. For example, I've heard he refuses to hire composers as he doesn't want another crew member to have that degree of influence over his work. Some think his total control over his productions is becoming his downfall, and those claims could have credibility. He's an auteur some may say, I say he sounds like a control freak, however I understand he has a very particular vision. It would be interesting to see him work on projects that aren't completely his own. Working that way would see his career become more prolific and hopefully would avoid him making awful referential trash like 'Death Proof' again.Although not a career high, 'Inglourious Basterds' is a worthy addition to his canon that's original yet in possession of all the entertaining earmarks of a true Tarantino film.www.hawkensian.com",8,0,1,18 November 2012
12 Angry Men," '12 Angry Men' is a true timeless classic
","The film examines prejudice and the sheer callousness of human behaviour, issues which will forever be relevant. At the beginning, 11 out of the 12 jurors are happy to see the accused, an 18-year-old Latino from the slums, be executed by the state. Initially this seems unremarkable, you assume that they all have good reasons for their verdict. However it's soon apparent that most of the jurors have just glossed over the facts, reaching their damning conclusion because they 'just think he's guilty' – there's even one juror who can't wait to leave the room so he can go to a baseball game. Only Juror #8 (Henry Fonda) is disturbed by the hastiness of it all; he doesn't know whether the kid is guilty, he just wants to at least talk about it before the jury so swiftly condemns him to death. I've praised films such as 'Killer Joe' for their success in engrossing its audience despite much of its story occurring in very few locations. However, compared to '12 Angry Men', 'Killer Joe' is a veritable action adventure - this legal drama never leaves the jury room. Its success in gripping its audience and fully involving them in the characters and plot is a masterful achievement of writer Reginald Rose.At the table sits a spectrum of personalities, all of whom you can identify and resonate with. Some are measured, some are fickle, some are blinkered and one or two are downright pig-headed and obnoxious. The natural, timeless performances allow you to cross-examine them; they are all personalities one has come across before, and the viewer can probably draw parallels with people they know - this is one of the film's core strengths. Sidney Lumet's debut feature is to be lauded for its reserve and lack of sensationalism. There may be those who doubt the credibility of some of the case developments, but to my relief, I personally found few if no traces of hyperbole or implausibility. '12 Angry Men' is a film I truly admire, a timeless classic that deserves the attention of all generations – it will continue to live on as many of its contemporaries continue to date.www.hawkensian.com",9,0,0,6 March 2013
Green Room," Green Room is light on story but excruciatingly heavy on blood spattered, genre-leading survival thrills,
","Director Jeremy Saulnier knows a thing or two about set pieces. Head shots, too. The harrowing events of Green Room occur in just several rooms, yet Saulnier's stripped- down script and direction creates a veritable white-knuckle ride of desperate reversals of fortune and shocking explosions of violence.The victims of all this nastiness are The Ain't Rights, a struggling Punk band comprising Pat (Anton Yelchin), Sam (Alia Shawkat), Reece (Joe Cole) and Tiger (Callum Turner). After stealing some petrol for their battered old camper van, they head to Seaside, Oregon, where a local DJ arranges a gig for them at a 'right-wing' venue, an offer which the destitute band cannot afford to decline.When they arrive at the club – which is in an ominously remote corner of the Pacific Northwest – the shaven heads, tattoos and sketchy, leering glances make it clear that the crowd is not merely right-wing but positively fascist. It is at this moment that a feeling of palpable danger and isolation starts to germinate, a feeling that comes to brutal fruition when Pat is witness to a murder in the club's green room.In a hail of panic and confusion, the band and Amber (Imogen Poots) are locked in the room under the guard of Big Justin (Eric Edelstein) and his fully loaded Smith & Wesson .500, which he explains has cartridges so large that only five can fit into the cylinder. What ensues is a savagely intense siege that affords both its protagonists and the viewer very few luxuries.After the first few instances of jarring violence, I feared that the film was going to be ninety minutes of audience punishment in the style of The Loved Ones or Wolf Creek. Thankfully, the fortunes of our besieged protagonists do improve, albeit in a wayward and unpredictable manner. It is all the better for it too – the twists and turns of the band's seemingly insurmountable predicament had me in a choke hold until the very end.What makes Green Room so engaging is its relatability; it is much like Deliverance in this respect. Both films thrust normal people with little experience of violence into a lethal situation, causing the viewer to wonder 'what would I do?', 'where would I be in this group's dynamic?'.Similarly, the protagonists of both films have no one to turn to, no outsider that they can fully trust. With his smooth diction and measured disposition, Darcy (a very interestingly cast Patrick Stewart) initially appears to be a mature voice of reason amongst a pack of rabidly aggressive young men. Alas, such hopes do not last as the contrary becomes quickly evident. It is only Gabe, played by Saulnier's childhood friend Macon Blair, who appears to be someone the band can work with. Blair channels much of his performance through an anguished gaze that reveals shades of anxiety, doubt and shame. It seems that Gabe has fallen prey to Darcy's steely manipulation.This is about as dynamic as the characterisation gets, because although Green Room features fine performances across the board, it is a film that's driven by genre-leading survival thrills rather than plot and characters. If you choose to go and see it – prepare yourself!75%www.hawkensian.com",7,3,10,23 May 2016
The Prestige," The conclusion is comically implausible, but the preceding two hours are thoroughly engaging.
","Ultimately, like so many of Christopher Nolan's films, 'The Prestige' is ridiculous and far-fetched. The story twists in a way that beggars belief, in a way that's so desperately lacking in plausibility that one asks themselves 'Did I hear that correctly? Has it really just gone in that direction?' Thankfully, this occurs at the end of the film, the preceding two hours produce, generally speaking, a delightfully realistic, taut and human period drama that engrosses far more than I expected. The film follows two magicians Roger Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) whose rivalry becomes so bitter and intense that it escalates to deception and violence. Their desperate attempts to exceed each other are genuinely engrossing, especially when Borden first develops 'The Transported Man'. Angier and Borden's romantic partners, Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) and Sarah Borden (Rebecca Hall) respectively, are dragged into the acerbic rivalry, resulting in betrayal, adultery and depression. Indeed, the aforementioned twist is a vital device that makes the film, in the writers' minds at least, 'work', which means the film is rather flawed. The climax undermines everything that made the film good, but those two hours soften the blow considerably. All performances are solid, particularly Rebecca Hall's, who has a real, sweet naturalness about her that struck me as soon as she graced the screen. Christian Bale's accent takes at least 40 minutes to get accustomed to, it has an odd, contrived strain to it that normally only appears in interviews. As everyone knows, he's British, but I think his true accent was lost in Hollywood a long time ago, I'm no longer sure what his real accent is, and I don't think he does either.",7,0,0,11 September 2012
The Hateful Eight," The Hateful Eight suffers from an overly long running time, comparably forgettable characters and the weight of expectation, but it eventually comes to life,
","It's easy to determine the worst film of Tarantino's career, it's Death Proof. That one's firmly at the bottom of the totem pole. Some way up to around the middle of the pole are both volumes of Kill Bill, which had fun action but were utterly lightweight. Deciding which film occupies the top of the monument is quite difficult, as I like Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction, Inglourious Basterds and Django Unchained for a variety of different reasons. These four films are a showcase of the wit, cine-literacy, explosive conflict and idiosyncrasies that have made Tarantino perhaps the most popular director of the past twenty years.On the surface, The Hateful Eight has the earmarks of a Tarantino film. It has dialogue in abundance, squibby gunfights, incessant use of the word n*gger and a hollering Samuel L. Jackson, but Quentin Tarantino's eighth film is a decidedly mediocre entry into his much loved oeuvres.The immediate problem is pacing. Unlike some, I seldom found the pacing of Inglourious Basterds or Django Unchained to be a problem, but The Hateful Eight, which has been politely labelled a slow burner by some critics, burns too slowly. It takes a whole half hour of gruff, uneventful drawl before we reach Minnie's Haberdashery, in which the remainder of the film's 187 minutes takes place.Once we're in the cabin, the aggressively cautious John Ruth (Kurt Russell) demands the identity of everyone. There's Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L Jackson), a bounty hunter who is fine but doesn't depart from familiar Sam Jackson territory; Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), the goofy, ebullient Sheriff of nearby Redrock; Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), Ruth's foul-mouthed bounty who's on the receiving end of multiple elbows and fists; Oswaldo Mobrey (Tim Roth), a stereotypical Victorian gentleman and hangman; Bob (Demian Bichir), a mumbling Mexican; General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern), a cantankerous bastard who fought in the Civil War and Joe Gage (Michael Madsen), a completely disposable stock character.It is unlikely that any of these characters will leave much of an impression on the viewer, they are Tarantino's most unremarkable and thinly drawn in quite some time. You will not find another Vincent Vega, Jules Winnfield or Colonel Hans Landa here. One would think that a film with this title would have eight very unpleasant characters, and I suppose it does, but I didn't hate them because I didn't care. There is a flashback scene in which they are genuinely hateful, but its placement towards the end of the three hour running time blunted its power, all of the narrative baggage that preceded it was distracting and dispiriting.Like he did in Kill Bill vol. 1, Tarantino could've made up for the weak characters with some great set pieces. His career has been punctuated with long scenes of iconic humour and dialogue as well as biting tension, suspense and unpredictability. These elements are sometimes present within the cramped four walls of Minnie's Haberdashery, especially when the mystery begins to unravel. Compare this to Inglourious Basterds, however, and you'll be swiftly reminded that The Hateful Eight lacks the energy, excitement and intrigue that we expect. There's nothing that matches the opening interrogation between Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) and the French farmer or Michael Fassbender's excruciating altercation in the basement bar.Perhaps most damaging of all is that the dialogue and humour also suffers by comparison. There's no golden watch sequence, no 'I just shot Marvin in the face' moment. There's nothing that approaches the loquacious flair of Reservoir Dogs and particularly Pulp Fiction. The Hateful Eight's most memorable set piece is an ill-judged exchange between Samuel Jackson and Bruce Dern, in which there is a cutaway scene featuring fellatio. It's crude, unimaginative and below the standard of a two- time Oscar winner for best original screenplay.All of this would have been avoided if Tarantino had just given the screenplay to Tracy Letts, who wrote the wonderfully twisted Killer Joe. Letts is a Pulizer prize-winning playwright who knows how to ignite all manner of drama within a cramped domestic setting; he also knows how to write an outrageous scene of fellatio. Letts would have stripped it down and added a bit of spice, or probably a whole ghost chili, knowing him.The tone of this review has been largely negative, but I didn't hate or even dislike the film. The Hateful Eight is just something of a misfire, a weak ending to Quentin's so- called historical trilogy. It suffers from a slow start, but the crescendo that builds following the interval reaches a climax that lifts the film up, albeit not to the height of his previous efforts.73%",7,0,6,3 February 2016
The Expendables," A surprisingly entertaining film that ignores credibility with delightfully wanton results.
","All realism and credibility is thrown out of the window in this delightfully macho celebration of the 1980s action film. The action scenes are huge, loud and fantastically violent. It blends brutally choreographed mêlée, explosions and gunfights, with each one of the Expendables having their fair share of the action. However, although the film is satiatingly steeped in aestheticised violence, I did find that some of the CGI violence wasn't as tangible as I'd have liked, I prefer old fashioned squibs and syrup. This is unfortunately a problem in many modern films, even in the incredibly violent 'Rambo' (2008).The plot is a simple, familiar one; it follows the Expendables as they infiltrate and overthrow a Latin American dictator, with the token sinister executive thrown in there for good measure. Away from all the wanton destruction are parts that are surprisingly character driven, particularly the chemistry between Stallone and Statham, whose tough, competitive camaraderie may be somewhat clichéd but certainly entertaining.As the image above suggests, a terrific cast has been assembled, it includes: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Mickey Rourke, Randy Couture, Steve Austin and even cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger. There are some notable names missing from the cast, but thankfully there's scope for a whole Expendables franchise, giving many other fan favourites an opportunity to become an Expendable. This is probably the first time that I've found myself wanting a mindless blockbuster franchise to come to fruition; with a team of cine-literate, witty writers, the possibilities are almost endless for potential sequels. Who knows, the film could even attract some heavyweight talent in the form of Clint Eastwood, Robert De Niro and Al Pacino - 'The Expendables' could add further dimensions to its celebration of masculinity!Perhaps my satisfaction with the film was accentuated by my low expectations coming into it, but I think I would've enjoyed it regardless of expectation; it delivered the masculine, ridiculously excessive carnage that, for me, makes it a funny, exciting break from reality - I left the film with a big smile on my face.www.hawkensian.com",6,2,4,9 August 2012
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," An engrossing drama that's marred by crude dialogue, dubious casting and wayward narrative shifts
","The first thing that must be said about Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is that it is a step in the right direction for Martin McDonagh. Everyone loved In Bruges, it was a perfect blend of the dark and the humourous, and it had a lot of heart, too. However, that pathos was lost in his sophomore feature Seven Psychopaths, which favoured cineliterate metafiction and frivolous pop-culture gags. A cursory read of the synopsis will tell you that Three Billboards is more than a return to the dark tragedy of his debut. Indeed, just the title suggests that McDonagh has once again made the location of his story a character in itself, only this time we have the verdant mountains of the Deep South (it was filmed in North Carolina) rather than the spires and canals of medieval Bruges. This sweeping backdrop is stage to a vicious yarn about small town America and small town attitudes. In short, it is about Mildred, a tough, belligerent woman who uses a provocative message spread across three billboards with the aim of reigniting the search for her daughter's murderer(s). Again, Mildred doesn't suffer fools gladly, but just when you think that there are no cracks in her granite veneer, the textured interplay of McDonagh's characters start to reveal them. This is especially true of Mildred's relationship with Sheriff Willoughby, which, despite all the public mud slinging, has an underlying respect and mutual schadenfreude sense of humour. Their chemistry has a particularly poignant depth when Mildred swiftly drops her prickly facade to comfort him in a desperate moment. Scenes like these are the highlights of Three Billboards. However, there are several problems with the film both small and large. Firstly, there's too much swearing. It may well be an honest depiction of the way these people speak, yet much of the incessantly crude language seem to be played for the laughs, and it didn't elicit many from me. Secondly, there are several questionable castings, namely Abbie Cornish - who is too young and too Australian to be a credible wife to Woody Harrelson's characte. Even more egregious is Samara Weaving's performance as Penelope, the stupid young girlfriend of Mildred's white trash ex-husband. Again, she is just not credible; a girl with her kind of wholesome attractiveness just wouldn't be with a scummy lowlife like Charlie - she needed to be brassier. The worst thing about her character, though, is how flatly written she is. In fact, she's not a character but a cheap, ditsy punchline delivered with wide-eyed obviousness.The third and most problematic issue, however, lies with the narrative. There are two important acts of violence in the film, Jason Dixon's brutal assault of Red and Mildred's firebombing of the police station. One can see how these violent set-pieces serve as the nadir of the each character's tempestuous personality, but they largely go unaccounted for. These are both serious crimes, yet Jason merely loses his job and Mildred is barely even questioned; I'm sorry, but such drastic crimes would have interrupted and overruled whatever was happening beforehand. Some may argue that such narrative matters should be overlooked, but credibility matters. These flaws prevent Three Billboards from entering great movie territory, but Martin McDonagh's third effort remains a well-acted and engrossing drama that sometimes hits the same darkly humourous notes of his superb debut.",7,0,3,17 January 2018
Glory," Ultimately rather average
","'Glory' charts Colonel Robert Gould Shaw's (Matthew Broderick) appointment to the head of a coloured regiment through to his battles with institutional racism during the American Civil War.As a result of familiarity and the majority of the characters being quite bland, I found Glory's central theme of racism somewhat unremarkable. The flattest characters in the film were the troops of the coloured regiment, who should be central to the film. The problem is they're not, which is an issue. 'Glory' is adapted from Robert Shaw's letters to his mother, meaning the film is naturally focused on him. Consequently, the core subjects of the story are quite underdeveloped.Morgan Freeman gives a very Morgan Freeman performance as John Rawlins, the measured, sensible and wise Sergeant Major, characteristics so typical of Freeman's oeuvres. Denzel Washington is more interesting as Private Trip, an angry runaway slave who's understandably embittered with the world and everyone in it. This anger manifests itself as bullying, he's always provoking people who threaten that chip on his shoulder. His wrath is felt particularly by Corporal Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), an educated, well dressed man whom Trip considers an uncle tom.Trip is a decent character and convincingly played by Washington, he conveys that pain and anger well; his Oscar winning turn is probably the best performance of the film. However Trip is, like the rest of the film, still somewhat unremarkable and overly familiar. There is one scene where Trip remarks how the regiment is 'the only family he's ever had', which is so clichéd and predictable you could see it coming a mile off.What perhaps is worst about the film are the battle scenes. While there's a grisly headshot at the beginning and it succeeds in depicting the disgraceful death of the suicidal battle charges, it ultimately does not convince or affect. There's far too much choreography going on, whether its soldiers exuberantly throwing themselves about under cannon fire or the almost laughable scenes of contrived mêlée where the soldiers run about rifle butting each other like in some second-rate action film.Mark Kermode spoke of how 'Glory' had 'visceral war scenes' that were 'long before Saving Private Ryan'. Indeed, 'Glory' was before 'Saving Private Ryan', but the latter heralded a new level of brutal realism, after its awesome 169 minutes you feel completely battered and depressed. I am very surprised that Kermode would compare this tame piece of work with Spielberg's stark WWII epic.Despite my reservations, I wouldn't say 'Glory' is a bad film, it goes along just fine. Although I thought there should've been more focus on the black characters, it is Shaw's struggle to control and maintain his new regiment that's probably the most interesting part of the film. Although a compassionate man, he realises that he is now an authority figure, he must nurture a veneer of unwavering stoicism and power so the men respect and obey him. This means he must adhere to the rules of the time, including the ugly, violent ones. I was most engaged when watching Shaw wrestle with the officialism and racism of his regiment, however the men he commands are trite and boring.While it may have been more profound in 1989, I felt that the film, although competent, was rather neutered and covered well-trodden ground.",6,1,6,9 November 2013
Nightcrawler," Jake Gyllenhaal gives an excellent performance as Lou Bloom, one of the most compelling on-screen manipulators I've seen in a long time.
","Nightcrawler is a Schraderesque character study of a man far more dangerous than Travis Bickle. Like Bickle, Lou Bloom doesn't like people, however Taxi Driver saw Bickle feel compassion for at least one person, Lou seems to have contempt for absolutely everyone. Lou's interactions with other people have only one purpose – control. He is very opportunistic and has an unshakable confidence that isn't hindered by the human inconveniences of nervousness and guilt.Jake Gyllenhaal commands the long monologues of Dan Gilroy's script, stealing every scene he's in as the unnervingly brazen and enthusiastic Lou Bloom. Gyllenhaal lost 20 pounds for the role and it really worked, his gaunt face and glaring eyes do quite a lot of the acting for him. The performance carries the film and this will no doubt be recognised by the Academy next February.In the film's opening moments, Lou is a vagrant who is shown committing crimes both petty and, it's suggested, not very petty at all. He's in the desperate pursuit of a job, and when he meets someone who could be of benefit, Lou initiates his charm offensive and inundates them with a relentless barrage of articulate yet platitudinous language as if he's reciting the effusive CV of a quixotic student.Although his self-promotion is overbearing in the first few instances, Lou soon proves his skill in accruing large amounts of information and repeating it with the utmost conviction and credibility. Gyllenhaal must have relished delivering director Gilroy's excellent script; his manner of speech reminded me of Patrick Bateman's highly detailed monologues on everything from his morning routine to Huey Lewis and the News in Bret Easton Ellis's American Psycho. Despite both men's articulacy, their diction feels recycled, and this is because it is – their cynical sociopathy means they cannot form true, sincere relationships, but they are able to counterfeit them through their adroit ability of learning and imitating the necessary behaviour.Quick wits and amorality are key skills for any successful paparazzo, so it is unsurprising that Lou Bloom thrives in the field. His first forays into professional prying are very funny. Inspired by a chance encounter with venerable camera man Joe Loder (Bill Paxton), Lou buys a rudimentary camcorder and scours the myriad streets of Los Angeles. abruptly stopping next to the scene of a car accident and poking his camera right in people's faces. When he's challenged he proclaims with an uncommon doubtfulness -'I'm fairly certain I'm allowed to do this!' You soon see Bloom gain confidence as he pushes the boundaries further and further, making for tense and unpredictable viewing.His audacity proves successful, snatching footage that's nice and gory, impressing Nina Romina (Rene Russo), the blonde, brassy director of a local news channel. Despite an appearance and demeanour that suggests seasoned business acumen, Nina spends much of the film under the thumb of Lou.After proving his worth, enjoying his growing control over Nina and soon realising how vital he is in maintaining the news agency's spiking ratings, Lou proves that his manipulation can work, albeit it very unattractively, in courtship. Gilroy's best monologue occurs when, over dinner with a reluctant Nina, Lou blackmails her into establishing a longstanding sexual agreement, using a business-like vernacular bereft of anything remotely romantic, erotic or sexual.Like Gone Girl, Night Crawler is a satire of the yellow journalism peddled by television news, content that's perhaps interesting for the public but not in the public interest, a distinction that is gleefully ignored in favour of lucrative scare-mongering and countless other immoralities. As the majority of the characters are under this satirical gaze, I found it hard to care when they fell victim to Lou's vicious conniving, my apathy even extending to his long suffering accomplice Rick (Riz Ahmed), who is too darn wet and spineless to get that emotionally invested in. None of this, I hasten to add, is a significant detriment, if a detriment at all. The film is attractively shot by Robert Elswit, much of whose striking work can be found in the films of Paul Thomas Anderson including There Will Be Blood (2007), Punch Drunk Love (2002) and Boogie Nights (1997), the latter's sun-kissed, neon-lit aesthetic being most similar to Nightcrawler's. Elswit's work here is also likely to draw comparisons with Newton Thomas Sigel's photography in the beautifully slick Drive (2011). With a tense, unpredictable narrative that's laced with strong satire and anchored by a great character and great performance, Nightcrawler is one the best films of 2014.88%www.hawkensian.com",8,3,5,7 December 2014

"Good Morning, Vietnam"," A dull, predictable film that's merely a vehicle for Williams's tediously overbearing comedy.
","There's a great Family Guy cutaway gag in which Peter Griffin and Robin Williams sit on a sofa as Peter names topics such as religion and politics for Williams to comment on. Williams does so with his trademark brand of insufferable overbearing comedy, which is filling any amount of time with frenetically incessant rambling. Peter responds simply with an exasperated sigh before leaving for a five minute break, which prompts Williams to start yet another barrage of supposedly funny noises. I felt much like Peter Griffin whilst watching Good Morning Vietnam. It reaffirmed my opinion that Williams was not the 'tragicomic genius' that so many purported him to be.Read a short synopsis of Vietnam and you'll know exactly what it's all about: the lovable family favourite Robin Williams being kooky, charming the troops but clashing with straight-laced, humourless authority figures. It's completely predictable and completely trite. They also throw in a love interest for good measure in the form of Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), a wholly lifeless woman whom Williams refuses to stop pestering.Williams is never funny during his radio broadcasts, however the film repeatedly tells us otherwise, showing us scores of characters struggling to hold back their tears of laughter. So many of the supporting actors, whether they're random troops or studio operators, were just diegetic canned laughter rather than proper characters.Make no mistake, Robin Williams isn't playing Adrian Cronauer, he's playing Robin Williams at his most loud and rambling. Williams is repeatedly characterised as the lovable clown who brings the people together, it's rather nauseating; no matter how hard the film tries, it cannot convince me that he's either funny or charming, only very irritating. Despite this, there are some moments that raised a smile, such as the language class scenes in which he focuses on New York City street talk rather than the artificial, staid sentences of the textbooks.Williams's flatly developed adversaries Lt. Steven Hauk (Bruno Kirby) and Sgt. Major Dickinson (J.T. Walsh) are the typical officious military men, they develop a resentment towards him that's so instantaneous that it's contrived and unbelievable; they're just narrative functions that try and make you feel sorry for Williams the lovable crazy cookie. Both characters aggressively impose their superior ranks on Williams and the other men, reminding me of the great Machiavelli quote – 'It is not titles that make men illustrious, but men who make titles illustrious.' Quite frankly, the quote is wasted on a trivial little film like this.It sometimes attempts to be a drama or 'dramedy' with moments of perfunctory war moralising, but ultimately Good Morning, Vietnam is preoccupied with indulging Williams's penchant for shouting incessantly rather than achieving anything approaching credible commentary or pathos. 45%www.hawkensian.com",4,17,38,23 August 2014
Baby Driver," Little more than a mix tape with dull characters and clichés attached to it
","I read an early tweet that described Baby Driver as 'a mix-tape with a film attached to it' and that proved to be an accurate comment. The tweeter may have thought this was a good thing, but I certainly don't.Yes, there are some good tracks and the action sequences are elaborate and frenetic (a little too frenetic, actually), but the characters are dull, unlikeable and bear very little relation to the real world. I simply did not believe in them, especially Darling, the sassy, kick ass stock character that only a fool would consider to be a strong female character.Then there's Baby, whose laconic, boyish demeanour makes him a rather uninspiring protagonist. His romance with Debbie, a cute little waitress, is yawn-inducingly clichéd, too.If you want a stylish heist film that isn't so bloody try-hard, then watch Drive. It's an exercise of style over substance much like this film, but it has suspense, atmosphere and characters that could actually exist rather than blaring music, mind-numbing action and flat, hateful comic book characters.",5,413,728,15 July 2017
American Psycho," A funny, solid adaptation with a perfectly realised interpretation by Christian Bale.
","Christian Bale delivers a superbly realised interpretation of Patrick Bateman; his performance has already become iconic. The nuances of Bateman's voice, which has an air of arrogance and comical sincerity, are identified by Bale and expertly delivered; Bale's performance is one of my all time favourites. The truly original narrator, endlessly quotable script and brilliantly dark, idiosyncratic humour have created a large following; it's the proverbial cult film.The film follows Patrick Bateman, a Wall Street executive in the prime of his life who is surrounded by equally affluent and aesthetic contemporaries. He is achingly vapid and appears not to have a sincere relationship with anyone, not even his 'supposed fiancé' Evelyn (Reese Witherspoon). In Bateman's world, everything is for surface value, even his job, which he continues with because he 'wants to fit in'. As the strain of his lifestyle begins to overwhelm him, Bateman begins to indulge in his violent urges.The film is adapted from Bret Easton Ellis' 1991 controversial novel of the same name. As anyone who has read 'American Psycho' will testify, there are passages that are simply unfilmable; the film was always going to be toned down in comparison. However, I feel the film has been neutered somewhat, I feel the film is lacking a visceral edge, it nails the satire, but it isn't quite dark enough. As the novel progresses, Patrick Bateman becomes increasingly psychotic and depraved, he descends into the depths of madness, and this isn't quite captured in the film. As sordid as it sounds, I do believe the film should have been crueller, darker; it should have put more emphasis on the depersonalisation and sadism of Bateman. There is one moment concerning an axe and a raincoat which is thoroughly entertaining and memorable, however it borders almost on slapstick, which it certainly didn't in the novel. The violence rightfully didn't enter exploitation cinema territory, I wouldn't wish for gratuity. But, then again, how do you define gratuitous? At what point does a film or book become gratuitous? These are questions that were at the forefront of my mind when reading the novel, and I think it's very hard to answer.Despite this, it is a good adaptation; Harron and Turner's script is sharp and overall makes good use of its difficult source material. For instance, the film incorporates the book's music chapters to great comic effect; Bateman expressing his admiration and laughably deep analysis of Genesis, Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis and The News to prospective victims. Through these scenes the viewer witnesses the lengths of Bateman's vapidity.It is a rather difficult film to wholly appreciate and absorb on initial viewing, which is good, because I feel 'American Psycho' has much replay value; I have revisited both the book and film countless times. Much like the novel, the film polarised audiences, and it doesn't surprise me. When viewing for the first time, one must appreciate Bret Easton Ellis used a large helping of hyperbole to convey his message of greed and superficiality, and also a good deal of surrealism. The film isn't entirely rooted in reality. The way in which Bateman's associates repeatedly forget each other's names and identities and how Bateman's actions become questionably implausible may confuse or deter the viewer. However, some would say that in our world of revolting socialites and vacuous celebrity and fashion culture, the extent of American Psycho's hyperbole is becoming increasingly dubious in places.'American Psycho' is a peculiar creation. Many people get it and love it, however I'm sure many would be perplexed by it, maybe completely disappointed by it. I am biased, but I know that I am one of many people who fully appreciate 'American Psycho', part of a large group who will know what you mean when you say 'I have to return some videotapes'. Some won't like or appreciate it, and that's no detriment of the viewer's, but if you do, then I think you'll find yourself revisiting the film and picking up a copy of Ellis' compulsively readable novel. However, regardless of whether you like it, I can guarantee that you'll never hear Phil Collins' 'Sussudio' in the same way again.www.hawkensian.com",8,0,0,9 August 2012
Dunkirk," Dunkirk lacks the character development to be in the pantheon of great war films,
","There is an engrossing immediacy about Dunkirk, you are thrust into the action and the grip seldom loosens. It is pure action, pure cinema. The problem with this is that there is little plot and little characterisation, so the impressive spectacle does get slightly repetitive at times. This could have easily been a two-and-a-half hour picture, so there was certainly room for greater character development. It wouldn't be excessively negative to say that this was something of a missed opportunity.",8,5,11,20 August 2017
American History X," Although it is somewhat heavy handed, American History X has great performances and a shocking brutality that leaves a large impression on you.
","The film is carried by Edward Norton, he portrays his character Derek Vinyard with real gusto and vitriol; what a howling, credibility defacing decision it was for Robert Benigni to trump Norton at the Oscars for his vexing role in the saccharine turd that is Life is Beautiful.Vinyard is an intelligent young man from a middle-class suburban home, however he rapidly develops fervent fascist views after his father is murdered by a black gunman. Vinyard has clear leadership skills and he channels them in all the wrong directions. His fierce oration makes him a notable figure in the Californian neo-Nazi movement, bringing him to the attention of veteran racist Cameron Alexander (Stacy Keach), who is well cast as the creepy, manipulative leader. The influence of both Derek and Cameron mean that Derek's younger brother, the rather more placid Danny (Edward Furlong), also harbours dangerous neo-Nazism, although not with the same zeal as his brother.To its merit, the film is unrestrained in its depiction of violent racism. With their foolish understanding of Nazism, the swastika adorned skinheads have a palpable hatred of all things un-Aryan. No one's hatred is greater than Vinyard's, who commits a brutal act of street, or rather curb, justice that has since become infamous. So abhorrent is the scene that it entered my top 10 most painful scenes in cinema history.It's Vinyard's act of violence that lands him in prison, where, perhaps predictably, he has a change of heart. I felt that the manner in which Vinyard changes is rather too pronounced and straight forward, the transformation of such an extreme psychology should have been more nuanced in its depiction – the shift of a psychological complex is one of subtle shades, not clearly defined, narrative friendly episodes.However, I think a good argument can be had about Vinyard's rapid change. Beneath all the extremism is a measured, intelligent man; he isn't an ignorant, retrograde fool, he's a subject one can work with. After all, his realisation isn't completely instantaneous, he integrates with the white thugs of his wing, the Aryan Brotherhood or whatever they call themselves, but their business practices are at odds with his strict principles. Combine this with his repeated and isolated work detail with the black Lamont (Guy Torry) (which I should think is an unlikely scenario for obvious reasons), and his sudden and considerable change of circumstance could have woken him up.There's a whiff of stereotypical characterisation at times; the two principal black characters of the film Dr. Sweeney (Avery Brooks) and the aforementioned Lamont are within the realm of the stock character, the latter particularly. They can both be deemed as 'Magical Negroes', a term that refers to black characters whose sole purpose is to serve the development of a white character. Sweeney is Derek's former and Danny's current high school teacher. He is a respected, righteous man with a seemingly infinite wisdom; he manages to disarm everyone with sagacious monologues and philosophical questions that are delivered with his deep, portentous voice. His character is heavily influenced by civil rights figures such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.Lamont, the inmate who Vinyard has repeated laundry duty with, is portrayed by comedian Guy Torry; I haven't seen his stand-up, however his manic, animated performance is certainly reminiscent of a Chris Rock gig. He's a rather frivolous character that's little more than narrative function that services Vinyard's character development.It's not a surprise to find that director Tony Kaye's career began in advertising, his visual flair has transferred to the silver screen and can be seen throughout the film, with repeated use of slow motion and a black and white pallet for flashback scenes. Considering History's subject matter, I felt the film was sometimes stylish to a fault, particularly during a racial territorial dispute on a basketball court that's constructed in a way through aesthetics and music that inclines the viewer to support the white men.Other examples of ill-judgement were during its humorous moments concerning the obesely corpulent and repellent Seth (Ethan Suplee), particularly during a brutal assault on immigrant supermarket staff where he steals a large plastic burger, it's not funny and is inappropriate in its placing.Although its morality tale is heavy handed and simplistic, I must reiterate that American History X is a highly memorable film driven by an incendiary Edward Norton and an unrestrained, vicious intensity that few contemporary films strive for.83% www.hawkensian.com",8,1,3,30 September 2014
Jackie," The deliberate pacing may test your patience, but Jackie remains an authentically personal account of an infamous crime
","It doesn't matter who you are or how much privilege you enjoy, having your spouse murdered so brutally beside you is a monstrous tragedy. Jackie captures the pain, both sharp and bleak, that the First Lady must have experienced during and after her husband's assassination. A particularly poignant moment is when Jackie sobs as she wipes the blood from her face; it is her first moment alone since the horrific shock of her life-changing trauma. However, her character becomes less sympathetic as she reveals a prickly demeanour with a tendency to be difficult. Not a diva by any means, just a bit unnecessary.The performances and period detailing are excellent, but Pablo Larrain's deliberate pacing is just a little bit too slow. It gets to the point where the repeated shots of Jackie's withdrawn doe-eyed face elicit annoyance rather than pathos. At 1hr 40 minutes, Jackie is not a long film, yet it could have and perhaps should have been even shorter. Perhaps the editor's scissors could have been taken to the sequences with Jackie's priest (John Hurt), which consist largely of asinine religious musings. Then again, Catholicism was more important to the Kennedys than it is to me.Even with the pacing issues, Jackie remains an authentically personal account of an infamous crime.",7,1,2,18 October 2017
Saving Private Ryan," Saving Private Ryan's genre changing depiction of battle means that thinly drawn narrative and characterisation is unimportant
","Saving Private Ryan is technically excellent, it achieved what very few films do – it set a new benchmark. The film's harsh aesthetic and desaturated colour palette has been emulated many times, Ryan's influence can be seen in films from We Were Soldiers (2002) and Rambo (2008) to Black Hawk Down (2001) and Fury (2014). Although there have been some decent efforts, I am yet to see a film that equals let alone surpasses the beginning 25 minutes, the final battle in the fictional French town of Ramelle and everything in between.The film follows the 2nd Ranger Battalion, the salient characters of which including Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), the affable yet authoritative leader; Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), the platoon's second in command; Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), a stylishly ultra- accurate, cross kissing sniper from the bible belt; Private Reiben (Edward Burns), an incendiary man from Brooklyn; Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), a Jew who relishes informing German captives of his heritage and T4 Grade Timothy Upham (Jeremy Davies), a very timid man who proves wholly unsuited to war. The men's mission is to locate and send home Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) on the compassionate orders of Chief of Staff George Marshall, who has been informed that Ryan's three brothers have all died in combat, their mother receiving the three telegrams simultaneously.'You wanna explain the math of this to me? I mean, where's the sense of riskin' the lives of the eight of us to save one guy?' says the argumentative Private Reiben. He addresses what I'm sure many viewers were wondering – is this premise plausible? Although inspired by and probably keen to emulate Lincoln's Bixby letter, would George Marshall have really possessed such compassion during a state of total war? It's interesting to note that screenwriter Robert Rodat developed the idea after reading a monument in Putney Corners, New Hampshire that listed the names of eight brothers who died during the American Civil War.Unlike Brad Pitt in the recent Fury, Tom Hanks gives the performance of an everyday man, a middle-class secondary school teacher thrust into an extraordinary situation. Hank's character Captain Miller reminds you of what is now the unthinkable idea of conscription, reminds you of how civilians with little or no prior interest, ability or training in the army were mobilised to kill and conquer. There's not much to be found outside of Captain Miller in terms of characterisation however, Miller's men are quite flat and unremarkable, apart from Private Jackson, whose ultra-accuracy is displayed with a stylish flair that's out of character in a film whose violence is appropriately ugly. Jackson is also a good ol' boy, a self-righteous bible spouting stock character who was recently emulated by Shia LaBeouf as 'Boyd 'Bible' Swan' in Fury.What I also found slightly troubling was the construction of the Germans, it was somewhat crude. Of the countless German troops we see in the film, the only one that is given any depth, 'Steamboat Willie' (Joerg Stadler), is shown to be a horribly callous backstabber; although, considering the context of total war, some may argue that he was just a soldier doing his duty. The narrative arcs of 'Willie' and Upham (the coward of the platoon) intertwine, climaxing in a scene that I think is ethically dubious.Despite both narrative and character development being somewhat thinly drawn, they're not that bad and, crucially, not the centre of the film. The film's great accomplishment lies in its seminal depiction of warfare. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski is to be commended for his raw, grisly aesthetic and his perfectly judged use of erratic camera movement, a style that has been messily emulated to nausea-inducing effect far too many times.Like many others have, I could praise endlessly the new level of gripping realist cinema that Ryan introduced to viewers; however almost all of this commendation is being delivered by people who have never experienced battle. How do we know what a battle truly looks and feels like? The majority of what I witnessed seemed realistic to me, but I can't offer solid corroboration as I stepped foot on Omaha Beach 70 years too late. Surely the ultimate endorsement and affirmation for Saving Private Ryan's authenticity is from the people who have experienced war.Written in the Florida Times Union on 15th August 1998 was an account of D-Day veterans 'enduring' Saving Private Ryan. This included Bill Faust, 78, who was accompanied in the theatre by only one other as the rest of his North Florida D-Day veterans' group walked out - 'I should have never gone to see that damn movie,' Faust said, 'In my mind, most of the details of D-Day were gone; all this did was bring them back it's better to keep them tucked away where they don't bother you.'The article continues – 'Vietnam veteran Ed Kelly, 57, left before the opening scene was over - 'I just couldn't handle it' Kelly said. 'The kid holding his guts; I had seen that in Vietnam. That was it for me. I got up and walked out. It was the closest thing to the horrors of real combat that I have ever seen.'There was also Jerry Markham, 79, who walked out of the theatre 'impressed and depressed, amazed but saddened by the realism of the sights and sounds, especially the instant deaths after the landing craft ramps were lowered.' Markham was a Navy chief petty officer on a demolitions team on D-Day and saw his commanding officer die this way - 'That scene broke me up... that was how it happened. Bodies were flying everywhere I wouldn't recommend it for young children, but anyone 14, 15 or older should see it they should start learning about how horrible war is.' I think all of this speaks volumes for Saving Private Ryan's credibility.90%(for the full travel article, please visit www.hawkensian.com)",9,1,2,17 November 2014
Gone Girl," Gone Girl is a dark, suspenseful and brilliantly twisty thriller with a sharp satirical edge
","I saw Gone Girl back during its theatrical release and I had so many good things to say about it that it became a hard article to write – it's easier to severely criticise something than to steep it in praise. The film really felt like an event, the widespread advertising had roused the interest of many people I knew. The trailer had certainly roused mine, it was an 18 certificate domestic thriller that really compelled me to wonder 'Did Nick Dunne kill his wife?' - I was sure that David Fincher would answer the mystery with his trademark style and vigour.Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' haunting track 'What Have We Done To Each Other?' filled the huge and completely empty auditorium as I walked into it, immediately creating the film's rivetingly dark, aberrant tone. The instrumental continued during the film's opening, which I expected to be another of Fincher's elaborate introduction sequences, but was actually far more understated. Dunne's suburban Missouri neighbourhood is captured in a slick, foreboding manner by cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth, who has collaborated with Fincher on Fight Club, The Social Network and The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.The film's first hour is riddled with a very ominous ambiguity. With his insouciant, equable manner, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) appears to be a likable protagonist who is taking his shocking situation perhaps too much in his stride. As new details emerge from the case, however, we begin to wonder whether Nick's nonchalance is a manifestation of a callous, sociopathic mind.There's not much more I can really say about either character or narrative development, as the film has a great twist. It is perhaps a spoiler to even say that, so I will stop. I was pleased to find that the film is just as good second time round, especially if you're watching it with someone who hasn't seen it, you can experience the film's twists and turns vicariously.In addition to its excellent plotting is a sharp satirical edge; Gone Girl's satire on the media is far more cutting and resonant than anything in the dull, self-satisfied and heavy-handed Network (1976). Ellen Abbott (Missi Pyle) - the brassy, brash presenter of a Fox News inspired current affairs programme - doesn't wonder about Nick's curiously relaxed behaviour, she declares with absolute certainty that Dunne is a sociopath who has murdered his wife. Abbott obnoxiously raises her voice as she shamelessly peddles bias and hatred to masses of people, inviting 'experts' to falsely corroborate her toxic claims. As the film progresses we see the extent of Abbott and her programme's fickleness and yellow journalism.As the media circus that literally surrounds Nick gets increasingly hysterical and dangerous, the threat of mob violence seems only moments away until Nick recruits Tanner Bolt (Tyler Perry), an affable and brilliant lawyer. Bolt's relish for challenging situations and unwavering confidence is very comforting for both Nick's and the audience's nerves - Perry gives a great performance as the amusing, quick-witted executive.To support Cronenweth's attractive photography and the wide, cinematic 2.35:1 format is the aforementioned excellent score by Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. The score is a collection of electronic ambient music that ranges from the peaceful with Sugarstorm and Like Home to the dark and disturbing with What Have We Done To Each Other? and Consummation, which is a sound straight from hell.Reznor and Ross are very adroit at creating music that perfectly fits and enhances each scene. Reznor gave an interesting insight into the collaborative methods between Ross, Fincher and himself in an interview with Hit Fix –'We made the decision to make music we felt belonged in that world, not for scenes, not for characters. We absorbed the script, we thought about the space it was in, the feelings involved, then spent a few weeks composing music from an impressionistic point of view, subconsciously almost, to run by David to ask 'Hey, does it feel like it's in the right world?''This approach was 'right on the money', inspiring Fincher which in turn further inspired Ross and Reznor.The Academy is routinely criticised for omitting quality films from their nominations and commending works that don't deserve it. I think this year's greatest insult is a Best Picture nod for the comparatively insipid American Sniper over this delightfully warped psychological thriller. They nominated Rosamund Pike for Best Actress at least, but I can't discuss her show-stealing performance here.93%www.hawkensian.com",9,2,6,20 February 2015
Django Unchained," Tarantino delivers another provocative and hugely entertaining film
","I love the sense of occasion a Tarantino film has, he's in the lucky position of being one of the most popular and controversial directors of the past twenty years. Some may find him self-indulgent, but the merits of his energetic, funny and flamboyant films are undeniable; it's fantastic that he is able to make such edgy blockbusters.'Django Unchained', which is effectively a 'buddy film', charts the relationship between German bounty hunter Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave Schultz rescues. Together they endeavour to save Django's wife from the notorious 'Candie Land', a vast plantation owned by the ruthless Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio).The film has a great ensemble cast. Jamie Foxx makes the most of his character, who for the most part is a 'man-with-no-name' figure. He accomplishes Tarantino's goal of 'giving Black American males a Western hero'. DiCaprio successfully depicts Candie as a pompous pseudo- intellectual and at times a nasty piece of work, however the extent to which he brushes off barbed comments from Django surprised me, there were moments where I wondered if he was menacing or authoritative enough. Based on the great 'Killer Joe' (2012), I wondered how Matthew McConaughey would have performed the role, he could have steeped it in menace, however I doubt he could have achieved the risible ignorance of DiCaprio.Christoph Waltz again showcases his talent here, however his character in 'Inglorious Basterds' gave him more scope to perform his charming but deadly persona. Samuel L. Jackson completely transforms into the character of Stephen, who is Candie's geriatric butler and the ultimate uncle tom. Jackson's performance is my favourite, he's both a tragic and very nasty figure. Tarantino himself appears in the later stages of the film with an Australian accent that ranges from being incoherent to not very Australian at all – thankfully it's strictly a cameo.There are laughs all the way through 'Django', a notable example being when slave owner 'Big Daddy'(Don Johnson) attempts to explain to a slave how she should treat the newly liberated and somewhat respected Django – it completely ridicules the nonsensical, pernicious madness of racism.I also found myself disregarding any form of moral compass and laughing heartily at the more cartoonish displays of violence. There is one particular scene that is a veritable bloodbath, seldom in the annals of celluloid has there been a moment more deserving of the term!Some have criticised the film's length, however I had little trouble with its 165 minute running time. There were indeed sections of the film, chiefly before and during the 'Candie Land' period, which could have been trimmed perhaps, however I was perfectly content.The majority won't be disappointed, the film has all the earmarks of a Tarantino film – he is the ultimate fan boy auteur. I can't wait to see it again.www.hawkensian.com",9,1,4,25 January 2013
Drive," Seldom has my opinion on a film changed so drastically
","I first saw the film in Romford on the way back from picking up my new car in Enfield, North London. Getting there had been hell. I was on the M25 and running late, but I decided to commit to seeing it, so I left the motorway and began to penetrate the Essex town. To my intense frustration, the roads were full of road works and were subsequently jammed, but by then it was too late to turn back, I had to see it through. Once the road works finally ended, the sat-nav kindly took me straight through the middle of the Romford shopping area, which was a cobbled street full of people, a place where I'm pretty sure cars weren't allowed – I must have looked a right berk.After much embarrassment and stress, I finally found the cinema and arrived at the screening just seconds before it began. The timing was great; however I was now in no mood to be watching a film.'Drive' has a very simple premise. Ryan Gosling is 'The Driver', a quiet, enigmatic mechanic and stunt driver who moonlights as a getaway driver for the underworld. His lonely existence changes when he meets Irene (Carey Mulligan), a sweet young mother who lives down the corridor from him. There is a clear connection between them, however her husband Standard (Oscar Isaac) returns from prison before their not-so-platonic friendship comes to fruition. Standard is being stalked and threatened by criminals, to whom he owes a mounting debt, a debt which can only be paid through a pawn shop heist. For the sake of Irene and Benicio's safety, The Driver conscientiously lends his getaway skills to the job, which of course goes horribly awry.Gosling's performance is good, he has a steely aura about him that is cold and convincing. However, I don't think one should get carried away when steeping him in praise, I felt it wasn't a particularly demanding role. While it is clear that he fits the mould of the laconic anti-hero, I was slightly bothered by the extent of his utter lack of conversational skills, particularly when he's speaking to Irene. There are moments that are so painfully awkward that it could test the plausibility of their relationship. Gosling is reminiscent of Clint Eastwood's iconic 'Man with no name' roles, but I also made a connection with Dustin Hoffman's performance in 'Rain Main'.I was very ambivalent about the film. I liked the exciting car chase in the introduction, I liked Cliff Martinez's stylish, haunting soundtrack; I also liked the visuals and the film's unforgiving, visceral nature. The film is spattered with torrents of claret, stark shankings and devastating gunshot wounds – there's also a spot of stomping. The film dishes out violence as it is, ugly and nasty. However, I had reservations with the lead character and particularly with its thin plot and meagre ending. I left the cinema feeling hollow and thinking it was all rather vapid.Despite all of this, the film had definitely got under my skin, I was thinking about it regularly. Eventually, I had to give it a second viewing.Being at home without the aforementioned stresses and knowing the framework of the film, I was able to enjoy it a whole lot more. I was engrossed from the start, relishing the style and edginess of it all. My past reservations took a back seat; it had gone up in my estimations two-fold. It was on my second viewing that I was able to appreciate the innate coolness of its leading actor. How on earth did he possibly make a white padded jacket with a yellow scorpion on the back cool? Oh and the driving gloves, they just reek of cool, oh and that black roaring Ford Mustang – I am so impressionable. It really got my heart pumping; I couldn't believe how the film had grown on me.Ultimately, though, like so many films, especially those that fall into the revenge/retribution format (think Death Wish/Taxi Driver), they're good until the last stanza, they're hard to wrap up. However, I even preferred the ending on second viewing – out of the ways they could've ended it, this was probably the most appropriate choice. While it is indeed a trifle shallow, if you watch 'Drive' on a massive television with an equally massive sound system, it is guaranteed to be a visual and aural treat.www.hawkensian.com",8,2,3,26 February 2013
Schindler's List," Schindler's List is a masterful blend of direction, cinematography, scope, score and performances, resulting in an epic of overwhelming power that only a cynic would dismiss.
","WWII and The Holocaust were events of mind bending statistics and proportions. Tens of thousands dead in single bombing raids, 20+ million Soviets dead, 15+ million Chinese dead, 6+ million Poles dead, 7+ million Germans dead, 11 million the victim of Nazi genocide – it just beggars belief. The European and Pacific theatres were so dreadful, so massive, that it's impossible for one to fully process it emotionally.Schindler's List is one of the finest cinematic depictions of those dark years; a sweeping, brutal film that brings a remarkable story to the attention of millions of viewers. However, as with all historical films, it does not serve as the definitive source of information.The film follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a Sudeten German businessman who reaped the benefits of slave labour during WWII. With his imposing presence and magnetism, he charms his way through Nazi circles, soon operating an enamelware factory in Krakow, Poland using Jewish labour. At this point Schindler appears largely indifferent to the persecution all around him, or rather he avoids confronting the ugly truth of the Nazis' approaching final solution.He eventually becomes acquainted Amon Göth, the callously evil commandant of the Płaszów concentration camp who is performed excellently by Ralph Fiennes. Göth was an incredibly violent man, the extent of his crimes were such that his sentencing was phrased as following: 'Amon Göth himself killed, maimed and tortured a substantial, albeit unidentified, number of people.' Göth's violence isn't sugarcoated in the film, he shoots dozens of defenceless people and never shows even a modicum of remorse, so fanatical is his hatred for them. The film is starkly brutal, there is no cinematic sheen, the scores that are shot bleed profusely as they fall to the ground like rag dolls.Fiennes, whose face can be both that of a mild-mannered Englishman and sinister villain all at once, delivers a performance that's nuanced and restrained yet hauntingly evil. Just like an inundated office worker, Göth complains to Oskar about the pressures of the job, which at the time is the exhumation of thousands of rotting corpses – 'Can you believe this? As if I don't have enough to do they come up with this? I have to find every rag buried up here and burn it.' Like Adolf Eichmann, the logistics man responsible for the deportation of hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews, Fiennes' depiction of Amon Göth is another example of Hannah Arendt's phrase 'the banality of evil'. It is a compelling depiction of one of the Third Reich's most committed defenders; a man deeply entrenched in Nazi ideology that has lost almost all humanity.The relationship between Schindler and Göth and his SS cronies is quite uneasy for the viewer. Schindler enjoys pushing the boundaries, he thrives off being a renegade, in one scene he kisses a Jewish woman in the presence of a whole party of SS officials.As the film progresses and Schindler realises both the abhorrence of the situation and his power to do something about it, something of a good vs. evil dichotomy arises. Deriders may say this is a simplistic construct, but it isn't, they are two complex characters. Their exchanges shows that Schindler is the strongest leader between him, he has personality and charm, whereas Göth only has ruthless barbarism, something Göth realises and struggles with.The film has grand scope and several brilliant set pieces. A notable example is the 'Red girl' scene during the liquidation of the Krakow ghetto, it is very impressive logistically, there are countless extras who all need directing. Schindler, who is atop a hill witnessing the brutality below, is the camera's point of view, following this little girl in a red coat (famously one of the few moments of colour in the film) as she navigates her way through all the murder and pillaging. The scale of the scenes at the Płaszów concentration camp is also considerable, particularly as great masses of prisoners, naked and completely dehumanised, are shuffled around like cattle for inspection.Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski said that the film was shot in black and white so it would look 'timeless'. I think the colouring achieved the desired effect, and I also think the film's visceral edge and authenticity was achieved through the hand-held, shaky cinematography that would later work so well in Saving Private Ryan (1998). A great film will almost always have a great score, and it is no different with Schindler's List as Spielberg once again found a masterful auditory companion in John Williams, whose beautifully melancholy score, particularly the central violin melody, has become instantly recognisable to many people.The depiction of the mass exhumation at Chujowa Górka is set against 'Immolation (With Our Lives, We Give Life)', whose stirring operatic vocals and chords make the scene almost apocalyptic. There is also notable use of Hebrew music, such as the ebullient Yerushalaim Shel Zahav and the haunting Oyf'n Pripetshek/Nacht Aktion. Even the trailer leaves a huge impression through music. 'Exodus', a work by the celebrated Polish composer Wojciech Kilar, has a brooding subtlety that emphasises the trailer's ambiguity, making its two minutes and twelve seconds most moving and unsettling.Despite massive universal acclaim, the film inevitably had its detractors, most notably Stanley Kubrick, who said:'The Holocaust is about 6 million people who get killed. Schindler's List is about 600 who don't.'Firstly, around 1200 were saved, not 600. Kubrick suggests that 'Schindler's List' is somehow a sugar-coated account of the Holocaust, it certainly isn't. It is a true story, Oskar Schindler really did save 1200 people, it isn't a fanciful, maudlin figment of a screenwriter's imagination. It is an emotionally affecting yet tactful depiction of both the systematic murder of scores of defenceless people and a complicated man's remarkable act of humanity in the face of unimaginable suffering.97%www.hawkensian.com",10,9,13,12 June 2014
Amadeus," Amadeus is an entertaining if factually dubious biopic
","At the heart of Amadeus's narrative is Antonio Salieri's jealous admiration for Mozart's prodigious talent, with the wider meaning being about unearned privilege and power attempting to control and hinder creative genius. The most odious example of this is Count Orsini-Rosenberg (Charles Kay), the Emperor's most pompous little minion.It's also a film about the selfishness and immorality of faith, as shown in Salieri's obsessive behaviour and the faith he uses to explain it. Salieri, who jokes that he is the 'patron saint of mediocrity', believes that God gave musical genius to a crude, immature young man like Mozart just to spite him. Blinded by his self-absorption, it doesn't occur to Salieri that his anxieties are trivial and insignificant because he believes God is omnipotent - 'He' can listen to everyone's concerns no matter how trivial they are. So on the delusion continues...The film's main strengths are the leading performances from Abraham and Hulce, the opulent design work and the flashback narrative construction. This combination makes for a very absorbing film for the first 120 minutes or so, but Mozart's quite sudden decline did lose me somewhat. Could bereavement and a challenging project really cause such a spirited young man such damage? Well, it's little surprise that his decline would seem dubious because Mozart's mysterious death remains the subject of heated debate.Criticisms are few and minor. Some of the language is rather inappropriate for a film set in the high-society of 18th century Vienna -would Mozart really have said 'kiss my ass'? Also, the film's authenticity was wounded by the American accent of Tom Hulce, who otherwise does a great job.",8,0,0,23 December 2017
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," It is most certainly flawed, but The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas is likely to make this harrowing chapter of history more accessible for some children.
","The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas serves as an introduction for children to Nazism and the Holocaust; it covers quite a broad range of elements integral to Nazi Germany such as institutional racism, nationalism and indoctrination, albeit in a juvenile, contrived and ultimately implausible manner.The film charts the relationship between Bruno (Asa Butterfield), a German 8-year-old and Shmuel (Jack Scanlon), a young Jewish boy. Bruno is the son of Ralf (David Thewlis), the SS Commandant of a nearby concentration camp in which Shmuel lives, and Elsa (Vera Farmiga), who is largely ignorant of the Jewish persecution her husband is responsible for.The inquisitive, innocent Bruno first meets the titular boy in striped pyjamas when he stumbles across the camp perimeter next to the woods that surround his house. Bruno is puzzled by Shmuel's predicament, he doesn't understand why soldiers are 'taking their clothes away for no reason' or why Pavel, a former doctor, carries out medial tasks in their home. As he repeatedly visits Shmuel and develops a friendship with him, his confusion soon turns to indignation.Clearly, their relationship is unrealistic. The abhorrent reality is that the majority of children were killed immediately upon arrival at the camps, and even as a child who either somehow slipped through the net or was deemed useful, it is very unlikely that Shmuel could escape his oppressors' eyeshot so many times to speak with Bruno.I found the boys' exchanges to be quite contrived, much of their conversation made for awkward viewing. However, I would be interested to see a child's reaction to it, I think I am simply the wrong audience for the film. Considering his age, Asa Butterfield is a decent young actor, he has the potential to be a star. Scanlon, however, was quite stilted as Shmuel.A big problem with the two boys' relationship and indeed the whole cast are the English accents, it seriously affected the credibility of the characters. Even Vera Farmiga, an American woman, gives her German character an English accent, which she does very well incidentally. I'm sure the film's adult cast members were more than capable of at least hints of German or Eastern European, but attempts to do so by Butterfield or Scanlon would most probably have been risible.The most villainous and unlikable character of the film is probably Kurt Kotler (Rupert Friend), but he's also something of a caricature. With his chiselled jaw, blond hair, blue eyes and immaculate uniform, he is the personification of the somewhat homoerotic Nazi dream of Aryan supremacy. The problem is that instead of him being a compelling example of a Nazi propaganda poster-boy, Friend's character is an example of the clichÃ©d 'Ve have vays ov making you talk' Nazi stock-character. And of course, Friend makes no attempt to Germanise his English accent, which meant I just couldn't believe in him. The film's accepted presence of Anglo accents is the result of British luvvies' received pronunciation in decades of sword-and- sandal epics and various other films about European history. It's quite flattering I suppose, the English accent must have a certain gravitas and authenticity that audiences respond well to.With implausible characters and relationships, some viewers may begin to lose hope as the The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas descends into a sophomoric history lesson. However, it completely batters you with its shocking, powerful twist of a denouement - seldom have I seen a film picked up so greatly by its final minutes.63%www.hawkensian.com",6,1,1,10 September 2014
Logan," Hack, slash, stab, repeat.
","Logan certainly delivers in terms of hacking, slashing and stabbing, but the wounded bear routine of the titular character wears pretty thin. Logan is the antihero stock character very much in the brooding, world weary style of John Rambo. The zenith of the cliché occurs when Logan remarks that familiar tortured line: 'Everyone I care about gets hurt'. Jackman does transcend the limitations of his character with moments of raw emotion, but these are few and far between. The rest of the performances are fine, passable; although I would have liked to see Richard E. Grant chew some scenery. If you're going to cast a British baddie, let him go full blown Gary Oldman - what this bleak spectacle sorely needs is some charisma. Alas, the bland characterisation isn't saved by the narrative, which follows a monotonous cat-and-mouse formula that's bereft of any suspense. A viewing of 'No Country For Old Men', a preeminent cat-and-mouse film, will remind you just how tiresomely loud and noisy 'Logan' is.What we have then is a dumb and decidedly average action film with a filter stripped right from Johnny Cash's 'Hurt' video and a litany of brutally repetitive fight scenes.",6,12,26,2 April 2017
Into the Wild," McCandless was a self-serving fool, and the narrative suffers because of this
","This film was recommended to me by a couple of friends, I was looking forward to it, it had an interesting premise on face value, but by not even half-way through, the film had lost its appeal for me purely because of the ostensibly 'inspirational' material it was based on.I have backpacked around Europe and South East Asia, I wholeheartedly understand the appeal of travelling for extended periods of time and living out of a rucksack. I also, like many others I'm sure, can empathise with McCandless's contempt for expectations, uncertainty and pressure of young adulthood. But, quite frankly, McCandless was a selfish fool who lost all sense of rationality whilst making a grand statement about civilised society. He left his only sister with their emotionally distant, shallow and contentious parents to pursue his ill-fated adventure totally unprepared. So unfortunately, I couldn't see past the lead character's naivety and self importance. But despite this, I did find myself compelled to watch McCandless' interaction with the film's supporting cast; the hippies, old man Ron Hanz and dare I say it even Kristen Stewart's role were infinitely more interesting than McCandless' 'inspiring' mission. To think some viewers find his story 'inspirational' shows entertainingly poor judgement, they can't have seen the whole film! Again, I stress that this film isn't bad film making, it features good performances from the whole cast and some good emotive interplay between them, but it is all set within the context of the lead character's idiotic escapade, a fundamental aspect which I cannot bypass. It's a shame that McCandless has been immortalised for being so reckless.www.hawkensian.com",6,6,8,12 June 2011
Chariots of Fire," The biggest piece of Oscar bait to ever win Best Picture,
","This is a vanilla piece of cinema - classic Oscar-bait. Every character is a blue- blooded bore apart from Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a zealous Scotsman who refuses to race on a Sunday. This, believe it or not, is the central conflict of this bland British classic, the dramatic peak.Many will enter Chariots of Fire expecting dramatic, slow motion running to that iconic score by Vangelis, and that is what they will get in the opening five minutes. However, they'll have to go through about 100 minutes of dinners, sermons and received pronunciation until Harold's Olympic sprint, which finally breathes some life into the film by skilfully wracking your nerves.Even if the slack narrative was tightened up, the importance or interest of this story is dubious at best. Where's the drama, where's the sacrifice? There is none.",5,4,9,27 July 2017
The Artist," It's straightforward, predictable, and not entirely deserving of its Academy commendation, but 'The Artist' is ultimately a delightful piece of escapism.
","It's straightforward, predictable, and not entirely deserving of its Academy commendation, but 'The Artist' is ultimately a delightful piece of escapism. It's a well-made and audacious homage to the first stars of Hollywood. It's a joy to watch, I became aware that I had a smile on my face throughout the first twenty minutes, which was thanks to a combination of the jovial soundtrack, 'Uggie' the talented Jack Russell, and also I think Dujardin's rather infectious smile. However, it is slightly darker than you may have imagined. The film concerns George Valentin (Jean Dujardin), a silent-movie star whose well-being is jeopardised upon the advent of the 'talkies'. So, as you can imagine, the film is as much a drama as it is a romantic comedy, if not more. It's remarkable what the cast have achieved with this film. I'm sure many people would have their reservations about this silent film, but I'm certain they'd be engrossed from the start, completely indifferent that it's missing a fundamental dimension. Of course, silent films aren't completely silent, they're scored, and 'The Artist' has a delightfully expressive soundtrack. Its energetic, upbeat tracks are my favourite; they have your torso gently swaying and your head bobbing jovially. It's ultimately a very nice, corny little film with good performances from everyone, particularly from Dujardin. Though he is great in it, I feel his Oscar wasn't fairly earned; his job was very different to the other contenders that year. However, if there was an Oscar for 'Best Smile', he would've won without a doubt.",8,0,1,22 October 2012
Life Is Beautiful," It's ultimately a rather exploitative tear-jerker
","I entered 'Life Is Beautiful' not really knowing what to expect; I certainly didn't anticipate a part slapstick comedy. The film charts Guido's (Roberto Benigni) romantic pursuit of Dora (Nicoletta Braschi), their married life, the birth of their son, and finally their removal from Italy into an extermination camp by the Nazis. The initial phase of the story is quite pleasant and sometimes funny, it has numerous running gags all concerning Guido, most of which he uses spontaneously to impress and bemuse his love interest Dora.Guido is an affable, happy-go-lucky character, his spontaneous charm works well overall, especially in a scene where he manipulates an important guest's choice of dinner and in another where he comically translates a rather ominous looking Nazi. However, he can become exhausting, and he also becomes somewhat brash considering his surroundings in the latter half of the film. This brings me on to the depiction of the Holocaust. Guido's escapades within the camp are completely implausible and rather stupid, he sneaks around being his effervescent self whilst it is clear that in reality he would've been shot dead very quickly. The film doesn't offer hope because of its sheer implausibility, all it achieves really is trivialising the Holocaust. This film is rather like the term 'ethnic cleansing', it doesn't work because it's impossible and perhaps insulting to try and euphemise genocide. I'm not sure who the film's target audience is. Is it a children's film? That is one of the few ways I could perhaps see it working, as a method of introducing a young mind to the Holocaust. But there is a problem with this, too, the film doesn't even begin to offer an insight into the haunting evil of the Shoah. Instead, the audience gets a completely maudlin tale of 'spirit' and 'hope' that, with very little veracity, exploits one of humanity's most abhorrent events for the sake of saccharine pathos.Judging from others' opinions, I think this film will bode well with the overly sentimental who enjoy crying and disregard credibility.www.hawkensian.com",5,1,3,9 August 2012
A Clockwork Orange," 'A Clockwork Orange' is a deranged piece of required viewing that has entered the annals of popular culture.
","I distinctly remember the first time I watched 'A Clockwork Orange'. I was only 11-years-old and it was a rainy, overcast afternoon – perfect conditions for watching a film. I was aware of the film's notoriety; I remembered my dad's excitement when he managed to find a copy of it in France in the late 1990s, telling me that it had been banned by the director in our country.Stanley Kubrick died in 1999, and sometime between then and 2004 a newly released English copy had been bought, presumably by my dad. With a certain degree of espionage, I managed to find the VHS and slip it into my all-in-one television and VCR player.As soon as the stark red and blue colouring of the opening scene flooded the screen, I was captivated. The strange aesthetic and Wendy Carlos' haunting Moog synthesiser soundtrack was unlike anything I had ever seen, I was utterly compelled by it and I knew I was watching something really special.The film follows Alex and his three 'Droogs', a gang of amoral young men who spend their evenings beating, stealing and raping. Since my initial viewing all those years ago, I have realised what gripped me as an 11- year-old boy, the terrific energy of the film's first hour or so. Yes, you're watching the Droogs 'tolchock' and rape, however Alex's completely unhinged life unravels on the screen with such vitality; it's a thrillingly deranged trip that swiftly grabs and immerses its viewer like few films manage.There is no other film that is quite like 'A Clockwork Orange'. It is riddled with idiosyncrasies, with its gaudy costumes, futuristic interior design and particularly 'Nadsat', the Droogs' esoteric language, some of which has since entered common parlance. It is also a film that truly feels British, particularly in its humour, which comes chiefly through the comments and sometimes rather slapstick actions of the eccentric central character. Another of its merits lies in Wendy Carlos' wonderful score. It blends classical pieces such as Rossini's The Thieving Magpie and Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with Carlos' Moog synthesiser renditions of Beethoven and Baroque music including Henry Purcell's March.There's no doubt that the film aestheticises violence and indeed glorifies the central character. The character of Alex DeLarge is one of cinema's greatest. Malcolm McDowell gives Alex an undeniable charisma that charms you, making him an antihero that you find yourself very much rooting for. During all of his nastiness he is never hateful, he has that infamous sideways grin that's menacing and comical in equal measure.All of this, of course, poses something of a moral dilemma. As the film progresses, our charismatic antihero who has both charmed us and appalled us willingly becomes the subject of a government experiment. Alex is a free man after undergoing the Ludovico Technique, which consists of forcing the subject to watch scenes of violence and rape whilst reconfiguring their brain. The treatment reduces Alex into a sickly coughing fit whenever he's in situation that's violent or sexual. I don't think Kubrick's film is one of the great pieces of sociopolitical commentary. The main problem is that Alex is not just unrepentant, he's psychopathic. This complicates a discussion about the penal system because Alex is probably untreatable, unlike the doomed subject of 'A Short Film About Killing', a lost and disturbed young man who is executed by the state before he can rehabilitate. After Alex's meeting with the Home Secretary in the film's closing moments, Alex's psychopathy could be interpreted as a comment on how those with powerful executive jobs, such as those in Westminster, are more likely to show the psychopathic, machiavellian traits possessed by Alex. To its credit, the film doesn't give any definite answers. Instead, it explores the complexities and difficulties of crime and punishment, presenting us with this dystopian vision of sheer state control and a wacky conclusion that leaves more questions than answers. 'A Clockwork Orange' is a spectacular synthesis of absurd aesthetic, striking cinematography, innovative music and an exceptional lead actor supported by a strong, interesting cast. It is a piece of required viewing that's entered the annals of popular culture.www.hawkensian.com",10,1,3,12 June 2013
Pulp Fiction," Pulp Fiction has accrued legendary status in well under two decades, and it's easy to see why.
","'Pulp Fiction' is a film with few flaws particularly worth mentioning. Since its release in 1994, the film has become nothing short of legendary; some may feel its praise from hipsters and venerable critics alike is undue, but I don't think it is. The film's non-linear narrative is so strong, so rich; it keeps you thoroughly engaged and develops the characters in such a way that you begin to run through your head the chronology of the characters' stories, making sense of Tarantino and Avary's complex script. This complexity makes 'Pulp Fiction' very re-watchable, I have seen it many times, and recently I was lucky enough to catch a screening at the Duke of York's Picturehouse in Brighton, which was an experience that reminded me of how special this film is. 'Pulp Fiction' explores the following principal characters: Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, a pair of loquacious hit men who appear to exist in a style vacuum; Butch Coolidge, an ageing but courageous prize fighter; Marsellus Wallace, a seemingly omnipotent mobster and Mia Wallace, the flirtatious wife of Mr. Wallace whom Vincent Vega is assigned to take out to dinner. The characters' stories famously clash with each other, regularly to chaotic and hilarious effect. Tarantino is yet to return to this kind of form. After 'Jackie Brown' in 1998, he spent time making the entertaining but comparably meagre 'Kill Bill' films, which were well orchestrated viscera, but ultimately below him. He then made 'Death Proof', which was an offensively bad, juvenile piece of work with a script of unprecedented annoyance. However, Tarantino made a comeback with 'Inglourious Basterds', which had a rather appealing premise and many memorable scenes. 2013 sees the launch of 'Django Unchained', which, with its ensemble cast and inevitable flair, is one of the most exciting films of the year. 'Pulp Fiction' has all the components of a classic, it has the scope and the quality, it is within the bracket of films such as 'The Godfather', 'Goodfellas' and 'Citizen Kane', films that will be revisited by audiences forever, films that are firmly considered as 'required viewing'.",9,1,3,11 September 2012
The Wolf of Wall Street," This film is not a glorification, it's an observer rather than a judge
","The Wolf of Wall Street is a rather straight forward rise and fall story, it's 'Scarface' with even more excess but without the M16 with an under-slung M303 grenade launcher.Some have said that this film is a glorification rather than a satire, a three hour parade celebrating Jordan Belfort's excess instead of a stern condemnation. Despite all the drugs, decadence and vulvas in the film, I don't think the film glorifies him, and I don't think it's a biting satire either.The film is an observer rather than a judge; it displays Belfort and his minions' debauchery in a grand three-hour narrative with the energy and gusto of 'Goodfellas', letting the audience decide what they think of it all. If one leaves the theatre impressed or inspired by Belfort, that's very much a reflection of them rather than the film.There is a lot of bad behaviour going on in The Wolf of Wall Street, understandably too much for some people, but over the course of three hours I didn't find it exasperating like some have. In fact, I think one would possess a certain amount of sanctimony to deny that there isn't a degree of allure to Belfort's lifestyle; an element of excess should be everyone's life, whether it's occasionally ordering that £30 sirloin steak or at some point in your life owning a car that does 20 miles to the gallon, just because it makes you feel good.Of course, that wouldn't begin to be enough for Jordan Belfort. His ideas on money, relationships and life in general were quite awful during his years at the helm of Stratton Oakmont, his company that employed the 'pump and dump' scheme to rob scores of investors of their money. It is Belfort's obsession with wealth, material goods and just winning that makes him quite a one-dimensionally unpleasant character. The nature of the character made me question the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio.This is not to say DiCaprio is in bad form here, his performance is teeming with conviction. Leo is in his element during Belfort's rousing, maniacal speeches to his employees; his frenetic energy reminded me of Evangelical preachers found in the southern states. Of course, there's nothing remotely Christian to be found in Belfort's fervent rhetoric, only sentences of remarkable crassness, immaturity and myopia – 'Does your girlfriend think you're a f*cking worthless loser, good! Pick up the phone and start dialling! I want you to deal with your problems by becoming rich!' – 'If anyone here thinks I'm superficial or materialistic, go get a job in f*cking McDonald's because that's where you f*cking belong.'Despite DiCaprio's committed performance, I'm not part of the indignant crowd who demand that he finally win the Oscar for best leading man, particularly with this year's nominations. He's had a great career so far, he's worked with Hollywood's most revered artists and has had a consistent stream good roles. Although his performances regularly display his great dramatic range, the problem is his huge Hollywood profile, I feel like I'm watching Leonardo DiCaprio rather than the character he is portraying. It's the same with The Wolf of Wall Street, Leo is just too cute and popular to play someone like Jordan Belfort – the casting gives a certain amount of sheen to him. Also, DiCaprio didn't adopt Belfort's New York accent, which is a pity because Leo's South African accent in Blood Diamond was impressive.While there are flashes of gross vulgarity in DiCaprio's performance, the real Jordan Belfort is worse. To his credit, he is a naturally adroit salesman, he ran a successful meat business in his early twenties, he could've probably made a substantial legitimate living with his innate entrepreneurialism. However he didn't, and now he remarks in interviews and speeches that 'making money is easy', what he forgot to add is 'when you broke the law like I did'. I'm not preaching here, I'm just reminding the crowds he draws to his motivational speeches that this man's immense wealth hinged completely and utterly on criminality.The other reason why Scorsese's Belfort isn't hateful enough is because the repercussions and victims of Stratton Oakmont are never shown, and to give a properly three-dimensional depiction of Belfort's story, they should have been. Scorsese and writer Terence Winter have followed Belfort's memoir so closely that it's quite a one-track narrative, perhaps they could have stepped back from the book and explored the extent of Stratton Oakmont's damage.So, it is clear that there's not a particularly complex figure at the centre of Martin Scorsese's latest film, but that certainly doesn't mean it's a misfire. This is 'Casino'/'The Departed' Scorsese rather than 'Taxi Driver'/'Goodfellas'/'Raging Bull' Scorsese. For me, the film's terrific energy and vibrant aesthetics manage to carry its three-hour running time. Among this spirited, flashy spectacle are also some very amusing moments, particularly Matthew McConaughey's great performance as Mark Hanna, a veteran stock broker who teaches an up-and- coming Belfort about his new profession, from ethics to the necessity of masturbation. What's become one of the larger talking points of the film is the sequence where Belfort, overdosing on Quaaludes and in a state he calls the 'cerebral palsy phase', tries desperately to drive his Lamborghini Countach back to his enormous house.Although the one-dimensional central character and its limited perspective means it is not Scorsese's best film, The Wolf of Wall Street is an engrossing, sweeping rise and fall tale that is vibrant, funny and very striking.www.hawkensian.com",8,1,3,1 February 2014
The Last King of Scotland," Although it features a superb transformation from Forest Whitaker, the largely fictional narrative that surrounds it is formulaic and implausible
","'The Last King of Scotland' is all about Forrest Whitaker; as soon as he graces the screen, he is Idi Amin. The unison of Whitaker's physicality and his superb East African accent, which is perhaps the most impressive element of his performance, transforms him into the Ugandan dictator.Although it is clear that Amin is a manipulator and intent on getting his own way, he is loquacious, magnetic and, surprisingly, quite affable. He charms both the viewer and Nicholas Garrigan (James McAvoy), the impressionable Scottish doctor who initially believes Amin's rousing yet hollow speeches.It soon becomes apparent however that this is a charm offensive, a manipulative process that wears very thin once Amin's deeply ugly, frenetic megalomania is laid bare. Like many of history's dictators – Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot – Amin succumbs to paranoia, and mass violence ensues.The film begins with the proclamation that 'This film is inspired by real people and real events', however it fails to state that the central character Nicholas Garrigan is actually entirely fictional. I hadn't looked into the film's veracity before watching it, however although there appeared to be clear narrative exaggerations at times, I had presumed that Garrigan was at least a real person. It is a typical example of the 'inspired by real events' cliché, 'inspired' is always the key part of the sentence.The film follows Garrigan as he inadvertently becomes Amin's personal physician and at times 'closest adviser'; it is indeed an extraordinary predicament, but I suppose stranger things have happened. McAvoy is good as Garrigan, his gradually souring relationship with Amin is interesting and intense, they have many great exchanges.However, with the knowledge that Nicholas Garrigan is an invention of Giles Foden, author of the book on which the film is based, Scotland's narrative seems rather formulaic and implausible. I found Garrigan's relationships with medic Sarah Merrit (Gillian Anderson) and Kay Amin (Kerry Washington) to be hackneyed plot mechanisms.While the film includes real events such as the Israeli hostage crisis at Entebbe International Airport, much of what occurs is either historically unfaithful or sheer fiction. The story was inspired by one of Amin's many self-bestowed titles – The King of Scotland.An example of the film's implausibility is the scene where Garrigan and Amin first meet. Amin's Citroen DS has been in a collision with a cow (what appears to be an Ankole-Watusi), leaving him with an injured hand that Garrigan tends to. The creature appears to be fatally wounded and wails in a pain until Garrigan, who has repeatedly asked for it to be put out of its misery, takes Amin's gun from the roof of the car and mercifully shoots it twice in the head.Although the surrounding guards train their guns on Garrigan, predictably Amin respects his audacity, and, amusingly, is particularly pleased when he finds out he is Scottish. It is a scene that is quite bereft of credibility.Although there are elements of character study, my main problem with the film is that it doesn't give an insight into Amin's rule and the atrocities committed under it. Although he is clearly a despot, a mentally ill bully, the film's emphasis on his fictional relationship with Garrigan rather than fact meant that I didn't find him hateful.'The Last King of Scotland' features a superb transformation from Forest Whitaker and a series of well-constructed scenes, however ultimately the largely fictional narrative that surrounds Whitaker is rather formulaic.www.hawkensian.com",7,0,1,5 June 2014
Blow," Don't waste your life on this horribly trite rip off
","'Blow' is a horribly dull rehashing of classics such as 'Scarface', 'Goodfellas' and 'Boogie Nights'. The problems are abundant. Its plot is rambling, bloated and tediously predictable - so many plot points are crammed into it. This poorly constructed narrative results with sorely limited characterisation. Some seemingly important characters come and go within ten minutes, it's a total mess. Much of the film is one long dreary drug deal, only the most immature viewer would be engaged or, even worse, allured by it. Most people will watch it thinking about how it lacks the energy, sophistication and talent of all the fantastic crime films it so crudely rips off. Few films are as annoyingly kitsch as this. Johnny Depp again proves his lack of credibility in the crime genre, his first attempt being in the similarly dull 'Donnie Brasco'. I'm not sure why some deem his performance 'excellent', his feminine features and lack of charisma just don't work in the genre. Ray Liotta plays Depp's father, the noble working class stock character that forms the film's rather flimsy anti-drug message. This fails because of the aforementioned narrative issues; the film is utterly devoid of any message that properly resonates with the viewer because it is all so hackneyed and clichéd. Most people who like this film appear to foolishly do so because they find it 'cool', much like the bonehead rappers who idolise Tony Montana in 'Scarface'. To make matters worse, the film also has mawkish lashings of sentimentalism towards the end. The crew had to have known how inferior this film was during production, I can imagine it was exhausting for them to complete the project with any conviction.www.hawkensian.com",4,4,7,2 January 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Disappointingly dull blockbuster fare.
","Upon reflection, I realised that 'The Dark Knight Rises' isn't much more than mediocre. It's little more than a multiplex pandering, noisy summer blockbuster that hides behind a veil of overly dark and 'serious' themes in a really rather pretentious manner. Much like its predecessor, the film is convoluted; its simple plot is dragged over 165 minutes. I actually didn't find the length particularly bothering, I don't think I started to fidget too much in my seat, but I was certainly aware that it was too long. Predictably, the film is overrated, much like fellow blockbusters 'Avatar', 'The Dark Knight' and 'Inception'. All of them adopt the generic blockbuster formula, one of the signature elements of this formula being the humdrum orchestral score, which either sounds like an approaching ocean liner or is so flat and featureless that you'll leave the cinema forgetting it had one. Christopher Nolan loves his epic narratives to be full of twists and turns, and he will create them no matter how implausible they are. 'Rises' isn't at the top of the implausibility scale, I think that area is reserved for 'Inception' or 'The Prestige', but so many parts of this film are tiringly unlikely and badly executed. I'm not a fan of literal film criticism, however Bruce Wayne transforms from a decrepit, gout ridden Howard Hughes figure to crime-fighting Batman within an hour, as if the rather damning diagnosis given at the beginning of the film was false. I think they were trying to cram in too many elements of its source material into the bloated plot in a 'Spider Man 3' fashion. Without spoiling anything, the ending is also a weak point; its sheer theatrical unlikelihood saps any power or catharsis it intended to be dripping in. The careless implausibility is to be found throughout the film, and for me, it detracted significantly from my engagement with the film. The film is striking, yes, but not as striking as you'd expect. The word 'epic' is being thrown around constantly about this film, but it's rather ordinary; it's decent, but it doesn't stand out like 'Avatar'. I must admit I found the opening of '2012' more exhilarating. Contrary to a rather sizeable opinion, I quite liked Bane. I liked his brutal strength and even his voice, which was only slightly irritating after the lengthy monologue delivered upon the car to the inmates. Christian Bale's performance was again quite unremarkable, like everything with the film - it was okay, nothing special. I like Bale a lot, it's not entirely his fault, it's the fault of the character's. Bruce Wayne and Batman aren't the deepest, most multi-faceted of characters; Bale is either the restrained, non-entity of Wayne or the growling Batman. The best performance is Michael Caine's, who has one particular scene that's given with a marked sincerity that is a real showcase of Caine's talents. Ultimately, I left the cinema feeling quite hollow. It wasn't all bad, but it was rather uninteresting, slightly stupid blockbuster fare.www.hawkensian.com",7,3,9,28 August 2012
Mother!," A decidedly inferior homage to Rosemary's Baby that amounts to little more than a series of pretentious metaphors and allegories
","I can absolutely understand why someone would dislike or even hate this film, but let's start with the positives. Firstly, the sound editing is excellent; you hear every footstep and creaky floorboard in the imposing, shape shifting house that is a character in itself. These unnervingly sensual acoustics aid the DoP's extreme closeups, which create an awkward, uncomfortable atmosphere. The performances are good, too. The problem is quite simply this - what on earth is it all about? Well, Aronofsky says his story is drenched in biblical references, but these complexities are only fully apparent to those who have either read Aronofsky's artist statement or are well versed in the good book. It's also been said that 'Her' represents mother earth while the rest of the characters represent the threats to our planet. This is the kind of over reliance of pseudo-profound metaphors rather than complex, believable characters and narrative that really turn me off. It's better to ignore Aronofsky's self- indulgence and see it for what is - a massively inferior homage to Rosemary's Baby with a semi-interesting metaphor about selfish masculinity at its core.Now the theme of self-absorbed, self-pitying masculinity could make for a very interesting film, but any possible resonance is lost when a filmmaker communicates this subject through a litany of chaotic metaphorical surrealism. The reverse is true of Rosemary's Baby, which is rooted in chilling reality with an endearing central performance by Mia Farrow, whose relationship with John Cassavettes's character is human and romantic. The relationship between 'Mother' (Jennifer Lawrence) and 'Him' (Javier Bardem), on the other hand, is bereft of development; we barely even see them communicate. You could argue that this is because 'Him' represents male self-absorption, but it's difficult to empathise with a couple that have such an odd lack of chemistry. This dubious central relationship quickly receives even less attention as 'Him' entertains a gradually increasingly large group of hateful strangers who further harass and use 'Mother'. Her treatment caused me to feel some degree of indignation, but I didn't genuinely care because mother! amounts to little more than a sequence of pretentious allegories and metaphors. It's just like watching a bad dream, and dreams don't have the tangibility and resonance of reality.",5,10,16,3 October 2017
Blade Runner," Fatally overrated, this film is remarkably dull.
","Blade Runner is nothing more than a visual spectacle, and its special effects are quickly failing the test of time, which means it's swiftly losing the only feature that could be considered somewhat redeeming. The film is remarkably flat, in terms of both its characters and narrative; it is completely unengaging in its entirety. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is assigned to find and kill 'replicants', which are 'biorobots' that have been declared illegal on Earth. The replicants effortlessly blend into society as they look and behave exactly like humans, their cover is blown only through detecting their lack of empathy. Many people revel in the many different cuts and theories of 'Blade Runner', it's got a prominent cult following. That's fair enough, but on initial viewing I was left bored stiff – when it comes to sinister cybernetic organisms, it doesn't get better than 'The Terminator' (1984)This clinical, emotionally detached approach is common in many of Ridley Scott's earlier work; the whole crew of 'Alien' were forgettable, much like the cast of 'Blade Runner'. I didn't sympathise with or fear any character, leading to its conventional, tired plot lacking any device to thrill, entertain or ultimately keep me watching. It took an act of will and devotion towards my friend (who is a fan of BR) to endure the whole thing.I have been aware of the film and its reputation for years, but I had never been that interested in seeing it, despite the looks and utterances of mock outrage I'd always get when I said I hadn't seen it. Well, now I have, and next time I can reply with 'Yes, I have seen it, and it's one of the most overrated films I have ever seen.'www.hawkensian.com",4,5,12,11 September 2012
The Deer Hunter," A vast, multi-faceted, albeit slightly maudlin epic with a beautiful score, striking cinematography and gripping acting intensity.
","A sprawling epic of three hours, 'The Deer Hunter' is a striking, moving film. It focuses on a group of working class men who live in Clairton, Pennsylvania; which whilst is an industrial town, is a pretty and tranquil part of the world. However, this is strictly the film's depiction of Clairton; it was actually shot in various locations across Ohio. These men have firm working class sentiments, they work in the steel factory together and, once their shifts are over, drop by the local bar to shoot pool and have a few drinks; this is the men's comfortable existences, however their lives are soon to be turned upside down. The men are called to serve their country in Vietnam, where they are to be subjected to an array of abhorrence that will change them forever. It is a striking film in every sense. John Williams' score, the acoustic 'Cavatina', is blissful; it complements every scene it features in. Its sequences of natural beauty and Clairton life are starkly juxtaposed in the film's second act: the infamous Russian roulette scene. It is acted with truly remarkable conviction; the actors must have forced themselves into an unpleasant place to produce such harrowing realism. The scene is so visceral and intense that it creates a disturbed silence amongst an audience; even its biggest critics would have to try very hard not to be affected by it. Normally a critically acclaimed film, 'The Deer Hunter' hasn't been devoid of criticism. It has been labelled melodramatic, and it does indeed have its maudlin moments, I agree, but it has also been accused of being 'racist'. It may be a one sided account of the war and I appreciate it was released during sensitive times shortly after the conflict, but I do not agree. Does a film have to cover every aspect of an event? Does it have to cover every perspective? Of course not. 'The Deer Hunter' reflects one case: one group of men and their exposure to a small group of sadistic belligerents. Some say the depiction of the Vietcong is racist, but to rational, informed people, I think it's clear that film the isn't suggesting that the entire Vietcong was like this. We realise that atrocities similar to those seen in the film are committed by both parties in times of war; to proclaim that the film is trying to tell us otherwise is false and preachy. I concede that the majority of the Vietnamese are, to understate somewhat, portrayed unscrupulously, but the extent of one's criticism should be that the characterisation is flat, certainly not racist. Additionally, there are pedants who moan about how there were no cases of Russian roulette documented over the course of the Vietnam War - it's called artistic licence. If you're so bothered by 'The Deer Hunter', if you yearn for fair portrayal, balance it out by watching Oliver Stone's vitriolic 'Born on the Fourth of July', which is a scathing attack on the United States' behaviour in Vietnam and their military and political ethos. Returning to another popular comment; I do concede its melodrama, especially during a scene where the American National Anthem is sung in unison: far too gushing and 'American'. However, overall, any flaw is completely pushed aside by its ensemble cast, its aural and visual impact and its ability to keep your attention for 180 minutes and leave a lasting impression on you.",9,0,1,9 August 2012
Annihilation," Self-important B-movie
","Annihilation riffs on Stalker, Predator and The Thing and manages to be worse than all of them, even Stalker, and that was really boring.The problem is that Garland's script is more interested in the science fiction of 'The Shimmer' rather than the characters, so we end up with Lena (Portman), the bland protagonist; Dr. Ventress (Leigh), the insufferable team leader with a smugly nonchalant demeanour; Anya (Rodriguez), an aggressive, thuggish stock character; and Josie (Thompson), a bookish non-entity. There was one other, I think, but when the characters are this disposable, who cares? There is little to make up for this dearth of character and chemistry; we get some sense of adventure and a few thrills and scares but in each case they are fleeting and mediocre. Instead, we get a bit of jumped-up B-movie science fiction that's presented in a miserably glum, portentous manner. Also, the CGI has a distinct lack of tangibility and is thoroughly overused.",5,6,12,14 March 2018
Evil Dead II," No where near as good as the great original 'The Evil Dead'.
","I don't get why this film is so popular on IMDb, It is no where near as scary and enjoyable as the original film 'The Evil Dead', which truly is genre defining. The film starts off quite well and I thought when the moose's head (which is on display in the cabin) starts laughing was quite amusing, but from there, the rest of the film was just Bruce Campbell screaming and shouting in a cabin. But they save the worst for the end when, believe it or not, a giant tree breaks into the cabin and teleports him back in time to some ancient city, where he shoots a Dino-bird thing, then he is celebrated by a load of knights. Come on what the hell was wrong with Sam Raimi when he decided to go along with that! 5/10 a very disappointing film.",7,1,3,18 August 2005
Law Abiding Citizen," 'Law Abiding Citizen' takes implausibility to the next level, and it isn't funny.
","This film is silly, and not in a good way. Any film you have criticised in the past for farfetchedness or implausibility will be put into perspective by this truly ludicrous film. Firstly, all characters are wholly flat and featureless; there is no depth or anything of interest in any of them, the film comprises only stock characters. Gerard Butler co-stars as 'Clyde Shelton', a seemingly omnipotent God-like figure who appears to be stronger and more capable than the FBI, the Philadelphia Police Department and various other judicial bodies combined. There's a line of dialogue that acknowledges this absurdity, but that doesn't make it okay. Shelton is on a mission to correct the judicial system, which he deems to have failed him after the murder of his wife and child. His extraordinary tactility and expertise are tenuously explained in a scene that gives a clichéd back story of how he was a human disposal expert, the character predictably saying 'He was the best'.His superhuman capabilities are all very convenient, but I don't think he's all that bright, because he clearly makes everything much harder for himself. Once the credits roll, it becomes apparent that the plot has one gaping hole, there was no reason for Clyde Shelton to want to be in prison, it would be completely illogical for him to want to be there; you'll know what I'm talking about if you decide to see it. Besides this fatal flaw, there are also the ways in which he exacts revenge, which become increasingly nonsensical and boring as the film progresses. All of this absurdity is fatally compounded by the fact it takes itself seriously. I expected to enjoy this film in a similar way I enjoyed 'Commando', a film which is implausible too, but works through caricatures, hilariously bad acting and fantastically corny one-liners. In 'Law Abiding Citizen', however, there is barely a grain of humour. Despite this, the film does provide one laugh, a scene in which a particularly irritating character is inexplicably killed by a maliciously modified mobile phone. This humourless and unbelievably far-fetched narrative prevents you from engaging with 'Law Abiding Citizen' on any level. Placing its tongue in cheek just occasionally may have been its salvation, but unless there is a drastic director's cut someday it will remain a brain dead pile of cheap viscera with a hugely generous IMDb score that speaks volumes for people's taste.www.hawkensian.com",3,3,4,9 August 2012
The Godfather," A twisting, dramatic masterpiece whose success relies on perfect casting and Mario Puzo's excellent novel.
","It's hard to judge a film like 'The Godfather', especially for someone of my generation. Since its release in 1972, The Godfather has accrued a legendary status; it's difficult to watch a film that is often touted as the best of all time with an open mind and no preconceptions. However, after watching The Godfather many times and reading the novel on which it was based, it's clearly something very special. The film is a sprawling epic that rewards the viewer with a savagely twisting, multi- faceted plot. It's a mobsters' coming of age tale that's laced with tension, deception, tragedy, violence and death.Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is introduced on the day of his daughter's wedding, a very special day in Sicilian tradition where the father of the bride is to deny no man a special favour. The beneficiaries' utmost respect for the Don is illustrated in the opening scene, their displays of courtesy coming in the form of personal address and greeting rituals. The Don is a man of respect and principle, a man who puts emphasis on what's fair, denying to avenge, for example, a father's anguish over the rape of his daughter by means of murder – 'That is not justice; your daughter's still alive'.In other circles however; the Don is not so respected. Vito Corleone is an old fashioned Don, what is referred to as a 'Moustache Pete'; he is reluctant to delve into the business of drugs, unlike the contemporaries from the rival New York crime families. The Don's refusal turns the relationship between the Corleones and many of the other families sour. It is how the ensuing violence is regarded as just 'business' that is the cold, harsh danger of the film. Its depiction of violence is visceral and often occurs when not expected. Rather quickly, the Corleone criminal empire falls apart; the next generation having to revitalise the family and reclaim their place at the top of the five families.The film is probably the most perfectly cast in history. The primary characters of Vito (Marlon Brando), Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Fredo (John Cazale), Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), Clemenza (Richard S. Castellano) and Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) are all expertly interpreted from Mario Puzo's magnum opus. The scores of supporting actors are also without fault. After reading the novel, it's remarkable how faithfully envisioned the characters are in the film, which is thanks to a combination of uncanny physicality and astute interpretation.The Godfather is a brilliant adaptation of Mario Puzo's masterfully told story; the 1969 novel was written with such an authenticity that it almost seems like non-fiction in certain passages. I think it's true that when one thinks of a gangster, they picture the omnipotent Vito Corleone sitting back in his chair, his glum face contemplating with that infinite sagacity and authority.The Godfather is a true spectacle in both mediums; deciding which is best is a difficult task. The only aspect that I felt was stronger in the book was character development. The character of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) is given greater depth in the novel; Michael's transcendence seeming comparatively abrupt in the celluloid interpretation. The character of Luca Brasi is abundantly more powerful in the book, whom whilst is an ally of the Corleone family, is penned as an ominous villain with a dark, brutal secret. The film, meanwhile, essentially depicts Brasi as an oaf. This depiction is understandable, Brasi is an old-timer who is firmly within a closing chapter of the Corleone family, however I was surprised by how markedly less intimidating a figure he was. Additionally, many of the supporting characters are also given interesting back stories by Puzo, notably Captain McCluskey. Of course, that level of intricacy is possible in a novel, while a film could easily become bloated with such detailing.Ultimately, 'The Godfather' is a film made by a highly talented crew who combined the seminal prose of a skilled author with brilliant direction, perfect performances, effective cinematography and the utterly beautiful, iconic music of Nino Rota and Carlo Savina to produce one of the best, well rounded and moving films ever made. It is a film that is wholly deserving of the term 'required viewing'.",10,0,2,9 August 2012
