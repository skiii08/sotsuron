The Rock," Rock-solid
","A solid action movie, but it's not Bay who's to be thanked for that.*MIGHT CONTAIN SPOILERS*The actors carry this movie. Sean Connery, Ed Harris and Nicolas Cage deliver good acting performances which give this movie something extra to lift it above the mass of similar movies.Direction and continuity are sloppy, camera work is good, except for the nervous zooming in and out during the car chase through San Francisco. Furthermore, to fully enjoy this movie, you should realize it's pure fiction, especially the locations. 90% of 'Alcatraz' as portrayed in the movie simply doesn't exist.Just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Null,1,1,4 February 2004
Predator," One of the best 80's action movies - period
","**CONTAINS SPOILERS**Certainly one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best, perhaps only second to T2: Judgement Day.The plot is solid, full of suspense as well as kick-ass action. The fact that the Predator is not revealed until 3/4s into the movie prevents this movie from becoming too cheesy. We don't see what's hunting Arnold and his comrades and it's the engine that drives the film. Acting and dialogue is very 80's style; lots of classic one-liners and tough-guy macho behaviour. We would expect no less, wouldn't we? The action is also what we expect from a film like this: Lots of explosions, flying guerillas and a guy hunting for an invisible Predator in the middle of the jungle with two submachine guns; one in each hand *grin*. You can't go wrong with this one.Verdict: The typical 80's action movie with that little extra which keeps you at the edge of your seat, at least the first time you see this movie. A big fat explosive 9 outta 10.",10,1,1,24 February 2004
"I, Robot"," A decent sci-fi action movie
","By all means, this movie is decent sci-fi action, but lacks the depth it claims.The movie opens with the Three Laws of Robotics, as stated by Isaac Asimov. In short, these say that a robot shall always obey humans and protect them and even through inaction, can never harm them. Cue Will Smith in one of his more serious roles. He still cracks some jokes every now and then and does some overacting in a few scenes. Luckily, only very few scenes so his overall performance is decent. The plot, which, without revealing too much of it, is based around the three laws of robotics going out the window, never really goes in depth and I got the feeling that the action was more important at certain times. Too bad, since the film tries so hard to be something more than brainless action. Effects were nicely done, the robots were looking good and some of the outdoors scenes were breathtaking. Will Smiths car was beautiful, but Audi sponsoring part of the film was too evident at some times. Almost all of the 'extra' cars were modified Audi's. Even the police drove modified Audi A6's.All in all, this film kept me pretty entertained for close to 2 hours, but didn't have me really thinking about what I just saw.A decent 6,9 out of 10 for this film.",Null,0,0,24 August 2004
Aliens," Pure Craftsmanship
","Why write a review about this movie 9 years after it's release? Because it's that damn good.This movie is the second in a series of 4 and, together with part one, stands so far above the other two parts that some even regard this movie as the final in the series.The plot pretty much stands on it's own, although having seen Alien before watching this movie adds a lot of extra depth to it. The barren planet LV-426 from the original has been colonized. No one knows what danger the planet harbours, until Ripley, the only surviver of the first movie, is found in an escape pod, floating in deep space. No one believes her stories about the alien, until all contact with LV-426 is lost. The Company sends her, along with a hardened group of Colonial Marines, back to LV-426. All hell breaks loose.One of the best things about this movie is how James Cameron managed to give an action-twist to it and thus make it very different from Ridley Scott's original. The first Alien is a real thriller with only one alien throughout the movie, the second a sci-fi action classic with tons of the slimy critters.The craftsmanship mentioned in the title of this review refers to there being no CGI whatsoever in this movie. Everything is 'real', handcrafted by the best artists of the day. It's going to be difficult to find this movie in a theatre somewhere, but for optimal viewing pleasure buy the Special Edition DVD. Watch the documentaries and you'll gain even more respect for the artists that created this movie.9 out of 10.",9,0,0,30 November 2005
The Usual Suspects," Unusual modern classic
","This landmark, inspired by the old film noir, is bound to become a classic for future generations.Direction, plot and cast are all of an unbelievably high level and set a standard in storytelling which sends many of the films currently in theatres home in shame. This film is the proof that you don't need a multi-million dollar budget for that extra explosion or car chase. Nor do you need excessive FX to make a great movie. The cast in this movie is exceptional. In 1995, none of the actors were real A-list actors, yet they deliver a great performance alone and as a group.Brian Singer's solid yet subtle direction fits the story perfectly. I guarantee you the second time you'll watch this, you'll watch it with different eyes, which brings me to perhaps the best aspect of this movie, The plot. It's phenomenal. It starts out simple, then winds it's way into complexity only to leave you stunned at the very end, which is amongst film history's best.This is a must-see film for everyone. 9.8/10",10,0,1,11 February 2004
Alien vs. Predator," Absolutely dreadful
","Thursday the 28th of October, 'AvP' came out in Holland. As a fan of the original Alien, Aliens and Predator 1 I wanted to see this movie for myself, instead of listening to critics here and there and not go. I believed that maybe it wouldn't be so bad, maybe all those reviewers were wrong.Well..It was even worse. I find it absolutely unbelievable how a single man can ruin two perfectly good franchises in one blow. That man is, of course, Paul Anderson. Having seen his previous work, expectations weren't that high, although Alien and Predator in one movie would surely make up for his lack of talent, or so I thought. I honestly hope they never ever let this man near an Alien or Predator movie again.Right, the plot. Charles Bishop Weyland, played by Lance Henriksen, finds the heat signature of an ancient pyramid under the Antarctic ice. A team is sent out to investigate and of course, once there, all hell breaks loose.Lance Henriksen, by the way, is the only one who tries to make the best out of the crap he's got himself involved in. The rest of the (unknown) cast walks around on autopilot. The film seriously lacks a charismatic hero such as Ripley or Major Dutch.Various errors and goofs are widespread throughout this film. When I got out of the theater, it was about 7 degrees Celsius outside and some of my breath turned into steam. Pretty funny then that if the main character is climbing an ice wall somewhere in the mountains, her breath doesn't turn into steam. Or when they're on an icebreaker, at night, near Antarctica. No steam. Small details maybe and I think the audience this movie targeted probably didn't notice.That gets me to my next point. Why on God's Green Earth did they make it a PG-13? Two R-rated franchises turned into one PG-13 movie? The ideology behind this makes me sick. Money, that's what Fox are interested in. Drawing as many 12-13 year olds to the theater.This comment turned out to be one long rant but I can't remember the last time a movie managed to infuriate me like this. Verdict: a 3,5 at best. If Paul Anderson is going to involved with a future Alien or Predator film, don't go and watch it. After all, would you reward a dog that pees on your carpet?",3,0,2,1 November 2004
