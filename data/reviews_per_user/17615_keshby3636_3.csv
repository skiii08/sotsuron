It," Awful movie.
","What a clumsy, awkward mess of a movie...and not even vaguely scary. My main reaction watching this movie was who in the hell directed it. Was it a novice director? It was a jumbled, disconnected movie. Just scenes shoved together. A very disappointing movie. I just sat through it waiting for something to justify the good reviews. Skarsgard and kids just didn't have enough to work with to pull this one off. Sorry to say but what a waste of time.",2,0,2,17 November 2017
Split," Seriously
",Shamalamaadingdong is a boring director and once again he has made a tedious movie. Has he ever done a good movie? It sucks and I think some directors should go back to school. This isn't very good and I don't understand why people liked it so much. I'm tired of cringing through movies and this made me cringe AND bored me. Thanks a lot. I can't help thinking the average movie audience are idiots....,3,0,2,2 December 2017
Kong: Skull Island," Must of offered Hiddleston a lot of money.....
","Wow.... I can honestly say that my only reason for watching this was Tom Hiddleston and after finishing it I am happy to say my shallow interest in the movie was totally justified because it sucked. Hiddleston was pretty so that was very enjoyable but otherwise the acting , special effects and script were horrid. Well done if one is looking for an embarrassingly bad B movie. The soundtrack was decent but the 70's rocked. Thank God for the wine that numbed it all.....",3,0,1,2 December 2017
