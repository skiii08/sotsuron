Blade Runner 2049," Was so looking forward to this...
","A singular lesson in why sequels often don't work.Independence day 2 is the other fine example in this tendency to turn down a blind alley.Blade runner worked because of how it was staged (forget the voice over and daft ending version) and how it was gritty. Leaving the ending hanging was the right place to stop at.Blade runner 2049 makes the horrendous mistake of feeling that there is more to tell.
Its a film that might have a good storyline in it but spends it's time confusing and inventing extensions to the original that have no reason to be.
Had it been developed as something different it might have worked.But it wasn't
And it doesn't.",3,4,7,16 February 2020
Paranormal Activity," Two hours watching a bad home movie...... please.... (spoilers within)
","98% of this film is mind-numbingly boring and pointless. The other 2% is contrived and pointless. Right, and I just sat through it.Its a substandard mix of Blair Witch and Exorcist with the plot quality of your average teen slasher movie. Strangely enough, that makes most of this almost believable as a straight edit of a home movie. Then, in the last 2 minutes, either the director or the film editor made a really bad decision on the final scene, threw away any shred of common sense and went for a contrived ending.What I really do not get is how anyone thinks any of this film is even slightly scary, or will stop them sleeping. Had any of the themes or plot devices been original, it would have helped, but since the sole selling point of this is the BWP style hand held camera, it fails.The one part that had me thinking at all was the sequence where Micah spreads powder to catch the demon's (NOT A GHOST!!!) foot/hoof/paw prints. The ploy works, until you see them. Chicken feet? What???? Even worse, the short sequence played back to show the marks being made very clearly shows three exact prints being made, by a biped, no powder kicked around, no impression of the feet (etc) rolling from ball to toes.... Why didn't he try and cover the demon with flour or something instead? I was guessing on a four foot tall, bad tempered, be-horned #something# for the dramatic irony, based on the 8 inch long feet. What would have helped the film a little, if ram raiding the Exorcist plot a bit, is the concept of actually bringing the demonologist in on the scene. Instead we get the very obvious demonic possession followed swiftly by the murder and the silly ending, that makes the whole unconvincing.I'm sorry, but unless you really want an excuse to fall asleep for two hours, simply avoid this film.",1,14,27,2 December 2009
