The Incredible Hulk," Green guy gets my attention
","I must first admit my hopes for a good Hulk films have come true when our big green friend first bound onto the screens in 2003 the hulk's future in cinema seemed bleak and i thought maybe a worse sequel or just a complete dead end would finish the Indestructible Hulk but Marvel Enterprises started The Incredible Hulk anew giving the Hulk a beautiful new start and the infamous hero has bounded onto the big screen like a true marvel hero. This film was breathtaking the acting from Norton was tremendous and really brought out the true Bruce Banner, I could feel the true cruelty and lust of power from Tim Roth, The CGI was fantastic and really showed of the hulk in all his glory. (SPOILER).........When the hulk sent of his famous Quote of 'HULK SMASH' it truly sent a brilliant shiver down my spine. I have always loved marvel and the way the detailed characters are shown of in the comics but the hulk looks even better on the large screen. Im glad the hulk had another chance to awe the public because i can see him awing them for a few more years to come.",8,4,10,12 June 2008
