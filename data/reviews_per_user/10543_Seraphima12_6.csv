Vertigo," Allure of Mystery and Obsession with Looks
","For me, this is not a typical Hitchcock movie. Though there are mystery and crime elements and also some thrilling moments, the film is more about 'believing what you made to believe to see'. And this makes it more of a psychological drama. Hitchcock cleverly shows us how mystery can lure us in and get hooked. What is more how unsolved mystery can become an obsession driving a man crazy.
Scottie, a retired detective with fear of heights, gets 'hooked' on a mystery of an attractive, seductive and alluring woman. He is lead to believe that she is 'possessed' by the spirit of her great grandmother who committed a suicide. Despite being a detective albeit a retired one, Scottie remains somewhat weak character due to his original flaw - fear of heights which is used by Gavin to manipulate him - and his fascination with the mystery of the woman he cannot comprehend. His non-comprehension of the subject deepens when he tries to recreate Madeleine's look forcing Judy to alter her hair colour and style and forcing her to wear style of clothes that Madeleine used to wear. Scottie is not interested in the real woman - Judy - behind the mask of Madeleine, he is obsessed with the looks of the woman that lured him into the mystery in the first place, trying to recreate exhilaration and attraction he felt. Gavin used Judy to impersonate his wife whom he murdered and Scotties uses Judy to impersonate the impersonated Madelaine. Both men do not care for the real woman. For them she is just a tool. Quite a reflection fo the Hollywood world back then and I believe even now.",7,0,1,11 April 2018
About Time," Utter banality
","When I started watching the movie I expected so much more. The beginning was great and then it all got lost as if Richard Curtis could not decide what the story should be about. Should it be about time travelling? Should it be about relationship between son and father? Should it be about the family? About love or about who knows what? Like scattered pieces of puzzle those questions pop up now and then throughout the movie refusing to fall into places to form a wholesome picture. The main protagonist, Tim, has some potential but then he lacks purpose or direction in his actions, he also does not know what to do with his life or his gift of being able to travel back in time. He does appear as nice and caring though so bloody dull and boneless. Supporting characters seem to be on their own, supporting no one in particular. The main heroine is nothing but pretty face who supposedly reads other people's novels. She lacks any interesting traits or lines to say. She is almost like a piece of furniture in the movie and you cannot help but wonder what Tim has found in her... Perhaps their dullness unites them... There are no great wisdoms or even small ones either. Two hours of time claimed but utter banal, trivial, storyless, directionless movie.",2,1,6,13 May 2018
La La Land," Unexpected Twist That Robs Off The Audience
","I must admit that I had enjoyed watching the movie until the point towards the end when out of blue we get a twist and a turning point that no one expects or is prepared for. This is when we realise that between the point when Mia goes to Paris and her return to Hollywood and a happy life with another man but Sebastian something very important must have happened but what remains in the dark. In fact, it becomes one big gaping hole which for me was a put off. To my mind, this kind of 'gaps' that lead to a twist cannot be done at the very end in a supposedly romantic movie where the audience invests their feelings into the main protagonists. This kind of end would compare to a zero ROI and even a loss if we were to invest financially in any course we believed in. Emotional investment of the audience is also an investment. Basically, I rated this film low only because of that. I regard it as an emotional rip off ...",4,0,2,20 March 2018
Limitless," Induced 'Mind Magic' or Cure from Writer's Block
","I find this movie both fascinating and at the same time limiting. It also unwittingly reflects on the questions of our mind, subconscious, creativity, abilities and what we can do with it all. I'd say that the way these notions are portrayed in the movie is more of a male view on the situation. Creativity cannot be forced and writer's blocks can be unblocked in so many other ways but by a single pill. 
Mastery, for me, lies not in taking pills to unlock our great abilities, hidden talents and enter the subconscious but by looking into ourselves, uncovering our own values, truths, talents and at the same time staying open to the world around us, staying tuned in, also using our intuition as well as logic. In a combination they are very powerful. 
On the other note, the struggles of the main protagonist, Eddie Morra, reminded me of so many writers, especially male ones, who try to solve everything by force, pills, drugs or alcohol and forget that the most powerful source is within us. They just should start using their intuition and creative side to unlock it. Having said that, I still believe it was fun to watch the movie to see how it will all end up.",8,0,0,17 March 2018
Beauty and the Beast," A Feast for The Eyes, Hearts and Mind
","I absolutely loved the movie! I watched it translated in French last summer in Geneva in an open-air cinema facing the lake Geneva. All the nights of the showing of the movie were sold out. As the movie runs for about two hours the cinema showed it in two acts, so we had a small break in between to have a drink and talk about it while anticipating the second part. 
What for the movie, I believe it is an excellently made one! Great combination of storytelling, musical elements, and wisdoms all skilfully weaved in. The characters, though well know from the fairy tale, were entertaining and freshly presented, their dialogues were witty and cool! I loved the twist on the French theme and all the songs too. And last but not the least, the truths presented in the story are classic ones, the ones that never go out of fashion.",10,1,3,17 March 2018
The Greatest Showman," A string of short music videos
","A very disappointing in terms of a movie. The story line is weak and left to bare minimum, the motivations of the characters are not clear, and the characters themselves are reduced to clich√©s. The title does not live up to the expectations - I still cannot perceive why the main character was a great showman?? Colleting 'freaks' and showing them to the public does not make anyone a great showman. Also, the movie seems to be patched together with a series of short music videos, some of which are quite repetitive in terms of choreography and execution. On the positive side, the costumes are lavish, the topic is intriguing, there are some interesting findings in terms of movie shooting and editing. But overall, the movie is not worth watching as it is void of meaning.",3,2,4,5 January 2020
