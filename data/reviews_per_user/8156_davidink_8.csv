Deepwater Horizon," Not a word about the ecological consequences
","I can't believe thid movie is 100% focused on the people working on the oil rig. To be crass: What's worse, 11 dead humans or the enormeous damage to nature and wildlife?Even in a situation like this, the station including staff and their responsibilities must be much better equipped to prevent or minimize the disaster on the surroundings. If not, such platforms should not be allowed.Obama said, 'This oil spill is the worst environmental disaster America has ever faced'.At least the last 1/3 of the movie should be about the aftermath. This is so irresponsible. It is just like another 'Towering Inferno' movie.",4,0,1,20 April 2020
A Star Is Born," Nothing special
","The only persons rating this high are Gaga fans happy to hear & see her. And for those who like me see Gaga as just a continuation of artists like Spears and Madonna, we can't see what the big deal is with the music either. The movie is in a category similar to The Bodyguard from 1992, but the older movie has much better singing and acting and story. Still The Bodyguard has only a 6.2 rating. Go figure.",5,5,10,11 January 2019
Darkest Hour," I feel cheated
","I really enjoyed the movie and am a big Oldman fan. But got sad and even angry when I read about how every event that cought your attention is not true. Never took place. Pure fiction. Like the train ride, or the verbal battles about peace negotiations, or who initiated Operation Dynamo, or peoples reactions to his speeches. I can accept when movie makers make 5 things happen in one day that actually took place on different days or merge 5 peripheral persons into one, as they so often do, to give it better momentum. But to take liberties with historical facts, the ones that make the foundation of the movie. Stop doing that... It should be illegal.And for those in a bad mood now: Check out 'Young Winston' from 1972. AFAIK depicts truth well, and at least I was surprised to know about his youth.",2,133,208,20 February 2018
Pacific Rim," For fast forwarding
","It is similar to the first Transformer movies but with more adrenalin and less finesse, humor & interesting actors. I just barely managed to get through it, with the help of the FF butoon at times. Do watch the sequel from 2018 though, it is much better.",4,0,1,25 May 2018
Coco," Weak script
","Too unbelievable and unlogical, e g when dead people have big screen TVs with camera crews and the TVs can even show items out of reach for the TV crew, or skeletons with rubber-like qualities in the bone and making a sucking sound when they kiss, etc etc. Watch Hotel Transylvania instead, seems to me that's where the idea of dead people comes from but much better thought through there, and FUN. Unlike the lame story in Coco. Great animation though.",3,9,43,20 February 2018
Joker," Not what you expect
","This is a sad and bizarre drama. Not at all a superhero or supervillain movie.If you after 20 min find this boring and hope that soon some DC Comic villain action will commence then stop watching. Because after 1 h it is still the same, and after that a bit more action but not entertaining, just sad and sickening.If I wanted to watch a good drama then I'd choose a true story or a serious real life topic, not this. I can't understand why anyone wants to write a story that is so sad and dark when it is fictional.And why use the Joker's name to sell this? Should be renamed 'Sad weird drama about a nonexistant psychological disorder'. Then see how many users it attracts..",2,11,25,20 December 2019
The Dark Knight Rises," 2 hours of fast-forwarding
","I am a big fan of sci-fi and super-hero movies, but this.. It is sooooo slooooow. I recommend fast forwarding most of the first 2 hours, stopping mainly at scenes with Selina or Blake, not only because these characters are interesting and to the point, but since these are the only main characters free from these endless monologues and dialogues and.. even chanting..I mean: Wow, how could this sleeping pill ever get higher ratings than Avengers, Guardians of the Galaxy or DC Comics' own Green Lantern? Or the underrated Ant-Man 2.Also, I remember the original comic magazines and Marvel have always been rather dark (the last Spider Man movie is actually a bi too positive to match the original) but DC Comics including Bat Man always quite.. clunky. For example I remember how Bat Man in one magazine was chasing a villain called The Ghost, who was like a ghost, no kidding. Seems to me DC have stolen the gloominess from Marvel and let it reach epic proportions.. but still in a clunky way!And the voice! The silly guttural voice. Even when he talks to people who know he is Wayne. Seems to be no off-switch?And Gary Oldman, an incredible actor and one of my favorites, does a character so uninteresting and free from depth and.. character.. If you're aiming at a Ned Flanders imitation then you did very well but.. Please stop doing this, you can do so much better.",3,2,9,20 September 2019
Incredibles 2," Not on the top 10 list of animated movies 2018
","If you love animated movies like Madagascar, Ice Age, Despicable Me, Monsters Inc and Zootopia, you will probably find this one below par. While most modern animated movies miraculously manage to capture the attention of any age group, this story seems to cater to grown-ups, and the word boring comes to mind.Most of the other movies I mentioned hardly lets you recover from one laugh before the next one hits you. There are in total maybe 3 laughs in Incredibles 2.
It's funny how this has a higher rating than Zootopia (2016) which is the best animated movie of 2016 in my mind (and for once I agree with the Academy Awards).I did like it slightly better than part 1 though, mainly because of the over-the-top baby. I recommend wathing it once provided you dont have too high expectations and provided Hotel Transylvania 3 isnt playing next door (which has much lower ratings, go figure).",6,0,1,15 September 2018
