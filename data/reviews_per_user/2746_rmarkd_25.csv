Angels & Demons," Silly and boring
","Angels and Demons starts off with the pope dying and the Vatican looking for his replacement. However, the four frontrunner cardinals for the pope and a vial of antimatter get stolen (all by one super-soldier guy) and it's up to 'symbologist' Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks), sidekick physicist Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) to figure out who the kidnapper/thief is.They don't have much time as one cardinal will be killed per hour and at midnight, the antimatter vial will break from it's magnetic container and cause a huge explosion. And, of course all the police are effectively useless and it's up to Langdon and sidekick Vetra to figure it all out.The movie follows that formula: Langdon figures out the first location, some action scenes and 'time is running out' suspense. Then another, then another. The problem is, it's so compacted that you're just hopping from one epiphany to the next. It's almost like the hold Batman and Robin tv shows where Batman is given a crazy clue from the riddler, thinks about it, then comes up with the solution after a few seconds. After doing this so many times in this movie, it becomes silly.What's also silly is the plot. So the pope's son Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor) is the ultimate villain, wanting to gain the papacy as he believes the church is getting to chummy with science. So he concocts a plan to get a guy to steal the 4 cardinals, a vial of antimatter, send Langdon and team on a wild goose chase only to save the antimatter vial just in time for it to just about explode and the only option is for McKenna to single handedly take it in a helicopter, sacrificing his life, but jumping from a parachute at the last moment. The conclave, seeing an apparent miracle, decide he should be the next pope. That's some Rube Goldberg type planning.I did enjoy The Da Vinci code much more. It's been a while, but I do remember it had much of the same thing, but not as condensed. This was a case of too much of a good thing + too crazy of a plan and it just ended up as a boring, silly, mess of a movie. That said, the twist with McKenna did surprise me. Sure, I had thoughts he was the villain, but I didn't *know*. That alone bumped this from a 5 to a 6.",6,0,0,27 June 2020
War Dogs," yeah, pretty enjoyable, but wouldn't say it's a comedy
","War Dogs is a movie about down on luck David Packouz (Miles Teller) and his childhood friend Efraim Diveroli (Jonah Hill). Diveroli is a small arms dealer, taking the 'crumbs' of weapons contracts from the military. Diveroli asks Packouz to partner with him and the two slowly move up, only to take a big jump in status with a risky arms trade to the US military in Iraq. With a nice gulp of success, they decide to stop with the crumbs and eat the whole pie with a 100 million AK-47 bullet order. Things come crashing down as Diveroli becomes greedier and angrier.It's weird that this movie is tagged as a comedy/crime/biography. The comedy elements completely failed as I don't recall any memorable moments. If anything, it got in the way of the story.But the story is interesting, suspenseful where it needs to be. Jonah Hill does an excellent job as playing a greasy slimeball type of guy -- a used car salesman stereotype that you wouldn't trust and didn't like, but know that he'd get the job done. Packouz is the scarier character in that he seemed to have the morals that Diveroli lacked, but, because he was poor and a soon to be father, probably saw Diveroli as a godsend. Had Packouz been a bit better off, he probably wouldn't have even considered Diveroli's offer. Indeed, Diveroli might have offered the partnership because he knew Packouz was down on his luck.Some things seem hard to believe, but given it's based on a true story and I don't know the true story, I don't know what was truth, what was exaggeration, or what was completely made up. But I did enjoy the ride.Yeah, this type of movie has been done before (Blow, Lord of War, Wolf of Wall Street), but I don't think this was trying to be a novel concept. It told a story of something that actually happened, and for that, it did it well. I did think Lord of War was far better, and only bring that movie up in case someone liked War Dogs and was looking for something similar.",7,0,0,19 June 2020
It," IT's okay (haha, me so funny)
","It tells a story of a group of kids in Maine, terrorized by a clown because, when has a clown not terrorized kids. It starts with a kid, Bill, whose little brother Georgie decides to go out in the rain to race a paper boat. The boat flows into a gutter, and as Georgie tries to retrieve it, we get our first glimpse of It in the gutter. After a little playful banter, It grabs Georgie, rips off his arm, then drags him into the gutter. Fun stuff.Bill has a group of friends, guy from Stranger Things, Jewish guy, preppy guy. They're taunted by a group of bigger kids led by Keifer Sutherland (wait, that's Stand by me). It's the last day of summer, and they decide what better way to celebrate than to continue to search for Bill's missing little brother. Along the way, the befriend fat friendless guy, girl, and token black guy.This group all have something in common in that they've all had run ins with It. They decide, as kids do when someone is terrorizing them, to investigate and try to kill this supernatural monster. Along the way, scary stuff happens until such point that enough scary stuff happens to fill the ~2 hours and things have to end.Oh, and there's a chapter 2 (read: sequel) when they grow up. Yeah, apparently It feeds on kids for a year, then rests for 27 years. But, you know, otherwise the town's great!Really, it's not that bad. I'm just having a little fun. For what it is, it's actually entertaining. The kids have great chemistry, Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd is great as Pennywise, there are some nice scary scenes, but not so scary as to be a full on horror movie.I think my issue is that, for all the power Pennywise has, it just seems like he/it is just stringing them along until such time the movie makes its 2 hours, at such time the fun stops. Yeah, there's something about kids not being fearful and that's why they were able to fight back. There's also something about them banding together. So yeah, being together and not being afraid. But throughout the movie, Pennywise had ample time to divide and conquer, like the myriad kids before. But for some reason he decides not to do that for these kids. Why? Maybe I missed it? Maybe it's in the book? Maybe it's covered in Chapter 2? Maybe it's in the Tim Curry TV version? Dunno.I will watch It Chapter 2. I enjoyed this movie enough to see how it resolves when the kids grow up. The movie started strong enough, but again, just seemed to meander until the climax. 6/10 decent popcorn flick, I guess.",6,0,0,12 May 2020
Unbreakable," Not too bad
","This movie will be misunderstood by some, I think; or perhaps it's me who has misunderstood.This movie is a comic strip brought to life. It's how a man slowly realizes he has gifts. The story unfolds slowly, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. What I liked is how it took the idea of a person realizing his powers in a world of disbelief. The ending, however, seemed rushed and unsatisfying. The twist was decent, but there wasn't time for the impact to really settle in.",7,1,1,29 November 2000
X-Men," Great movie for its type
","No, this isn't meant to be a complex character study. But what it tries to do it does very well. This is a comic book turned into movie. The movie had to do these things: 1) Establish the concept. What are the X-men? It did that. 2) Establish the characters in a manner that didn't take away from progressing the plot. It did that for the most part 3) Have enough action. It did that for the most part. 4) Get a person to want to see it again. It did that for me. 5) Make you want to see the sequel. It did that. 6) Get the audience into it. Sure did that where I went to see it.Again, just because this movie wasn't too cerebral is not a fault. What it needed to do it did, and that's why I rated it an 8.",8,0,0,21 July 2000
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Yeah, it was okay
","I liked Tom Holland as Peter Parker, Michael Keaton as Toomes / Vulture, and Jacob Batalon as Ned. Tony Revolori just didn't work for me as the bully type character Flash.The story is interesting enough. Adrian Toomes leads a cleanup crew after the Avengers battle in NY, but is removed and replaced by Tony Stark's crew. Dejected, he decides to use the alien tech he got from his haul and make weapons out of it.Parker plays part high school kid, part villain. Apparently he doesn't need to sleep, although, what do I know, maybe that part of his super power.The story was okay for me, but I just wasn't captivated. The whole thing with the spidey-stark-suit got old quick. Peter Parker skipping out on the academic decathlon and no one really caring doesn't seem right. School kids go on a trip, one of them goes missing, and... no big deal as that's what the alternate is for? There's also a scene where the FBI gets involved and follows Toomes. A fight scene happens where he's *obviously* got some sort of alien tech going on, but Spiderman runs the operations so... they just leave him alone after that?I was mildly entertained, but that's about it. Pretty forgettable movie.",6,1,1,14 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Better than Episode I, but not without flaws.
","This penultimate chapter in the Star Wars hexology is better than the last, but not flawless. With all the kids grown up and Jar Jar off to the side (though important to the progression of the story) Lucas has taken the cutsey feeling that TPM had.The story (no spoilers): Well, people are getting all antsy about something and factions are leaving left-n-right. The Jedi council is starting to get overwhelmed. Meanwhile, Kanobe is training young Anakin to be a Jedi. Anakin is now like a grown up punk who whines and bitches alot. Queen Amidala is now a Senator. It becomes a double story of protecting the senator (Anakin's job) and finding out what's going on (Kanobe's job).The good: 1) Yoda: Trust me, you'll know *exaclty* what I mean when you see this. 2) Ewan McGregor: Lots of action and a touch of humor, Kanobe is older but perhaps still needed more training as a Jedi. McGregor delivers the funny quips with good timing. IMO, his acting shines, though perhaps it's because he had the best lines. 3) Last 30 minutes. Finally, action! 4) No Jar-Jar. As I said above, he plays a central role in one scene, but other than that, is out of the picture. Good. Meesa couldn't take another movie him as a leading character. 5) Jango Fett: Bobba Fett's dad. Guy kicks ass. 6) Yoda: Yes, it's worth mentioning twice. 7) No mention of metachlorines (or whatever): In my opinion, the metachlorine thing was the *worst* thing Lucas could have done. The mysterious force is now just a bunch of germs. 8) Great aliens. Lucas knows how to paint a picture.
The bad: 1) Dialogue: Anakin uses a line on Padme that wouldn't work in a sleazy bar filled with women who haven't seen a man in years. Worked for Padme. Maybe he was using the force all along... Samuel Jackson delivers his lines without any emotion. Maybe that's what he was told to do, but it just seemed like he was reading his lines like someone who wanted to be somewhere else. 2) 'Pod-racerish scenes': There's a couple of scenes where you just feel that Lucas put them in only to show the CGI prowess. Not nearly as bad as the dismal pod racing scene, but it grew tiresome, at least for me. 3) Long strip of non-action in the beginning. For a (long) while Anakin and Kanobe split. Two stories are then told, switching back and forth between them. In the first hour, there's only one action scene. Lotsa talking. 4) Lame story progression. Example: Kanobe is looking for a planet not in the star charts. He asks yoda (and a bunch of kids) for help. Yoda tells him to go to the place where the planet should be. Uh, duh? 5) Missed opportunity in Anakin's transition to the dark side. I can't say much, but it's the scene where he goes back to find his mother. So much could have been done to show Anakin's transition. Why Lucas didn't do this, I don't know.It's better than Ep1, not as good as Ep4/5, and I'm not sure about Ep6. But it's worth seeing, it needs to be seen on the big screen, and it's worth seeing more than once.7/10.PS. Yoda rocks.",7,0,0,16 May 2002
Baby Driver," A fun ride that loses a bit at the end
","Baby Driver is about a young kid named Baby (Ansel Elgort), who is a talented getaway driver for bank heists doctored up by Doc (Kevin Spacey). Baby is 'a good kid forced into a bad situation', working these jobs until he can pay back Doc, from whom he stole something.Doc, however, likes Baby, and considers him his good luck charm, so that even after Baby has paid back what he took from Doc, Doc has him do another job. Baby is teamed up with Griff (Jon Hamm), Darling (Eiza GonzÃ¡lez), and Bats ( Jamie Foxx) to steal from the postal office.Meanwhile, Baby develops a relationship with a waitress named Debora (Lily James). Both want to start a new life, but Baby gets thrown into this gig. He plans to run away with her, but the plan goes awry.Pros:
* The music.
* The scene in the beginning where Baby is dance/walking to a song, all the while with the graffiti syncing every now and then with the words in the song.
* Solid acting by everyone with Elgort and Foxx being standouts.
* good chemistry between Elgort and James.
* 'Who doesn't like hats'? Not sure why I found that line so funny, but I did.
* The playful 'Easter egg' scenes like the song sync mentioned above, the dryer scene, the guns syncing with music,Cons:
* movie seemed to go a bit long near the end. The whole thing with Griff just got a bit unbelievable after a while.
* it was hard to believe, with all the things that happened, that they would still go forward with the post office heist.
* hard to believe Deborah would have left with Baby. She hardly knows him. Couple meetings in the diner, share a few songs, do laundry, have a dinner and she's ready to run away with him and potentially be an accomplice? Didn't seem believable.Solid 7. I enjoyed it and wouldn't mind watching it again to pick up on some of the things I missed, but I just wished they cut about 10 minutes near the end and that Debora choosing to run off with Baby was a bit more believable.",7,0,1,22 May 2020
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Flawed, but great. Visually stunning, the first time.
","It can be argued that this is the best movie of the year. I don't agree (Mulholland Drive is still my #1 pick), but I can see the arguemnt. But best movie ever? No.This movie is a loud, grand, spectacular epic that *MUST* be seen in a good theater. Live next to a crappy theater with two speakers for sound? Go somewhere else where the screen is huge, the sound is loud and the audience is repsectful of movies. You will not be disappointed. From start to finish, I was engrossed by the feeling of the movie, espcecially the amazing battle scenes. Visually stunning. And McKellen as Gandalf abslolutely shines in his role as the wizard.However, the movie is flawed. First, one is left thinking about some things. For example, why did the ring stayed so soundly in Bilbo's hands with no problems, how did Gandalf get his staff back? Perhaps these and other questions will be answered in the two sequels, but still, I felt the movie hurried at times with its explanations. The character development could be better for some and there are a couple scenes which seem wasted and one scene in particular which seemed a little too long to conclude (you'll know what I mean when you see it -- that or it's just me).Bottom line, it's a film that must be seenin the theater. Don't wait for the DVD/video. It has a truly epic feel to it, hopefully the start of an epic trilogy (Star Wars?), but isn't perfect. 8/10.PS. I would have given it a 9/10 but it lost a bit of its shine when I saw it the second time. Also note this review comes from a person who has *not* read the books.-Mark",8,0,0,27 December 2001
The Patriot," a whitewash of history
","This is the kind of movie that people made in the old days when the truth was hard to come by and history was whitewashed so much it looked like newfallen snow. The British were intrinsically evil. The hero is peaceful until something drives him over the edge. The villain does horrible stuff so that the audience is made to hate him. Yadda yadda yadda yadda --- yawn.The climactic fight scene at the end was ridiculous and hardly possible in a battlefield, but nevertheless, it's in there. This movie is good only if you want something to tug at your emotions sacrificing character complexity, plot and story.",5,0,1,29 November 2000
The Patriot," Pitiful
","This movie fails in almost every way Braveheart succeeded.
It's the kind of movie that's blind to most aspects of the war (and the time during the war) just to paint a picture. It's contrived the way The Green Mile was.Folks, many of the British soldiers didn't want to fight. Folks, black people were still slaves after the Revolutionary war. Yes, it's nice to see the black soldier and white soldier get along, but what does it mean? Nothing. And, c'mon. A 10 minute battlescene at the end without no outside involvement? That final fight scene was just plain dumb.There were some great scenes and this could have been a great movie. Instead it tries to force emotions and when you catch a movie doing that, it then falls flat on its face.",5,0,1,21 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," If I explained it, you'd think I was crazy.
","This is definitely a must see movie simply because it is so unlike anything else out there. Outside of saying that, there really isn't much more to say since it's very hard to explain without the person you're explaining it to thinking you've set up shop in crazyland. Any summary of the plot does not do justice to the movie. It's original and creative to say the very least. I'm not too sure how 'good' it is, partly because it's so weird, it's hard to judge. I do think there are some parts which don't work, and that if I see this movie again with an understanding of what's going on, I may lower my opinion of it. But it's definitely a movie you have to see once.",Null,0,0,6 November 1999
Resident Evil," Wow, pretty good!
","I have to admit that I expected to see a movie geared towards a teen crowd not looking to watch a film, but just to see action. While this isn't the most cerebral out there, it's more than I thought it would be.The bad: Well, at times the action does get tedious and convenient. For example, there's a scene where they get trapped in a room. A laser shines down the room at head level. Then it shines again at head level. Then it shines yet again, but this time forming a criss-cross pattern. Now, this laser is a defense mechanism, so why go for the criss-cross pattern right at the beginning? Why mess around? Things like that and some of the dumber, repetitive action scenes can get annoying.The good: I like movies which throw you into a situation where you are in the dark, and that's where this starts off. From a science lab, we see someone break a vial and leave the lab. From there, it switches to a woman in a mansion. No one knows what's going on (including her), and draws in those people wondering what went on (like me). The story is laid out where you don't feel manipulated and there are enough turns in it that you don't get the feeling that you know what's really going to happen. I also have to admit being surprised about the ending, but I liked it. The acting is what you'd expect, and the score fits well with the scenes.
Having not played the game, I can't say how well it takes from the game, but I can say that the movie is accessible for someone who hasn't played the game, and it's worthy of a rental. Bottom Line: It's a good action movie to watch on a Friday night with friends. 7/10 -Mark",6,0,0,20 April 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Magical
","I'll admit, after seeing this movie, I wasn't impressed at first. And there are still some things I didn't care too much for (like the desert scene which, for me, took away from the movie). But the more I thought about it, the more I see it as a magical fairy tale. You have to go into this movie with the frame of mind of letting the movie create the world for you. My mistake, at first, was not letting it envelop me. But once I allowed myself into the movie, I really enjoyed it. In doing that, this movie can be summed up in one word -- magical.",8,0,0,9 March 2001
Mulholland Drive," Haunting, beautiful. I can't stop thinking about it.
","First, let me say I've never seen a Lynch film, but was forewarned to the strangeness. Second, let me say I'm not an artsy movie snob, so I don't automatically like a movie I don't get.That being said, Mulholland Drive has been stuck in my mind for three days, and the more I think about it, the more I love it. The more I think about it, the more I want to think about it. After the movie, I was in a non drug-induced daze for two hours. While trying to sleep, it kept me up until midnight, then 1AM on the next night (not too late, but these are weeknights).So, what's it all about? Well, part of the fun is finding out yourself since some stuff is vague and subject to individual interpretation. I give my 2 cents below. But basically, we mainly follow two women in LA. One is a pretty, almost too bubbly blonde, looking to be an actress. The second is a mysterious brunette (Rita) with amnesia from a car accident. Beth helps Rita figure out her mystery while also starting her acting career. Then, something happens throws all of the above in the sh**can.Yeah, doesn't sound like much, and I wish I could grab everyone serious about watching movies by the shoulders and tell them to watch this movie. There is a mystery behind it, a bizarre 'normalcy' (the overabundant smiling), a mid movie twist, and one scene with a lone woman playing a Spanish version of Roy Orbison's 'Crying' which is hauntingly beautiful and worth the price of the movie ticket alone. Like the movie, I can't get the song out of my mind.I'll admit that many will not like this movie and even say that I cannot defend this movie. You either like it or don't understand how anyone can. I love it, and I'm not going to argue why. However, what I will say is that it's not as open-ended and unintelligible as it seems.Remember that dreams need a different interpretation and that thoughts in reality can become distorted in dreams. Below are my thoughts on the movie which will surely be different a week from now.It's not perfect, but it's close. If I could give a 9.9, I would, but IMDB-wise, it's a 9/10. Beautiful, haunting. I wish I could sit there and watch it again for the first time.SPOILERS!!! PLEASE DO NOT READ ON UNLESS YOU'VE SEEN IT AT LEAST ONCE, PREFERABLY TWICE. Note: These aren't truths, but my opinions. *Plot: It's a flashback. Diane dreams herself to be Beth and Camilla to be Rita. Near the end is reality, though mixed with some dreams. *Diane: Central character. In reality, she came to LA with hopes of making it big. She falls in unrequitted love with Camilla. Her dreams fall apart and she dreams the first part of the movie. *Beth: What Diane wanted to be, a sweet girl who could turn on the sexuality when needed (ie. her and the old guy. Damn erotic scene!) *Camilla: Glamorous superstar who used her charms with the director to win her part. She might have also used her charms on Diane. *Rita: What Diane wished Camilla was. Rita was lost, scared, dependent on Beth. Beth was confident, helpful. *The Camilla Conspiracy: Diane needed a reason as to why Camilla was chosen over her. In her dream, it was a secret conspiracy. She even showed Adam's interest in her, but that he could do nothing. *the cowboy: In reality, just a character caught in a glance. He's nothing. However, in a dream, things get changed around. He becomes a major player in why Camilla was picked. *Beth and Rita romantically: Diane was rejected by Camilla. In her dream, Beth told Rita she was in love with her and Rita reciprocated (and how!). It was how Beth wanted it to be. *Llorando (the song) and Silencio: ??? Perhaps a signification of the dream about to end (sometimes when I'm about to wake, my dream changes). The play kept going back to things being an illusion, like the dream. Llorando was Beth's realization of her sadness, played in Spanish because Camilla was (I think) *The box: portal to reality. *The clumsy killer: in reality, he kills Camilla. She has him in mind, but in her dream, portrays him as a bungling idiot. *Coco: In reality, a cold woman who couldn't care less about Beth. In the dream, a caring motherlike figure. *The scary face dude: ?? *The dead girl in the room: ?? *Why Rita wanted to change her hair: ?? *Billy Ray Cyrus: Absolutely no clue. Again, look at the dream as the way Beth wants it to be, remembering that dreams are distorted visuals of the sub-conscious mind. Things need to be interpreted. *The little people:Lastly, I may be totally wrong in all of this and welcome others' opinions.

Grave of the Fireflies," Sad and beautiful story
","This is the kind of story you wish they'd make more of.Yes, it's animated, but no, it's not like a Disney movie and no, it's not like the usual japanime people usually think of. This is way different.It's about a story of a boy (Seita) and girl (Setsuko) living in Japan during the near end of the Japan vs. US part of World War II. Their father is out fighting the war, their mother is seriously hurt in a bombing, and the two kids fend for themselves. It's told in a way that doesn't beg for tears, but sure as hell gets them. I don't want to give too much away, but there are times when you just have a gut reaction to what's happening to the kids. It's sad and haunting, and is a movie I highly recommend.Look at it this way, it's under 90 minutes, it isn't that long. And, having seen the quintessential anime movies (Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Princess Mononoke), Grave of the Fireflies is a level above them, and above most other movies, animated or otherwise. 10/10.",10,1,2,4 December 2000
There's Something About Mary," Just didn't find it funny...
","I think I could have counted the times I laughed on one hand. I just didn't think it was funny and the parts people pick out as particularly funny I thought was more gross than anything. Don't get me wrong, my sense of humor can get pretty gross, which seems to be out of step with my opinion of the movie.Just because you say 'ewwww!' at a scene and that scene has some vestige of humor in it, doesn't make it funny -- in my opinion.",3,0,1,23 October 1999
Super 8," Almost something special
","Super 8 is a movie about a bunch of kids making a zombie movie, which takes a crazy left turn as they witness a truck driven by one of their teachers crash into a train. The train carries some grey rubik's cube things as well as *something* scary.Soon, the small town the are in start experiencing things like power outages, missing dogs, stolen items. The Air Force is there because the train supposedly carried items for them, but the deputy doesn't think it all adds up.About 2/3s of the movie is just captivating. The kids are all pretty good in their roles not only seeming like genuine kids, but also, when filming their super 8 zombie movie, they genuinely seem like kids trying to make a kid directed movie. I think about myself trying to act like that at that age and I don't think I'd be able to do it.The story unfolds in a manner that keeps you interested, with layer after layer adding mystery. I don't know exactly when it started to unravel, but at some point it seemed to lose it's magic and just turn into another alien movie. And it's too bad too as Super 8 could have been something special. As it is, it's still a solid Friday night theater movie (though I saw it at home on a Monday afternoon). I do wonder what it could have been.Oh, and a couple of subplots did seem superfluous, such as the mother's death (no spoiler as it happens right at the beginning) and the large family of one of the friends. The locket thing at the end was also a little bit eye-rolly.7/10, starting as an 8/10 movie but dropping to 7/10 when all was said and done.",7,0,0,25 May 2020
The Shape of Water," Magical and beautiful, if you can suspense your disbelief
","The Shape of Water is about a mute woman Elisa (Sally Hawkins), who befriends and later falls in love with an amphibian man (Doug Jones) who was captured by Richard Strickland (Michael Shannon). Along with her coworker/friend Zelda (Octavia Spencer) and neighbor/friend Giles (Richard Jenkins), Elisa saves the amphibian man from the lab before Strickland has a chance to kill him. While waiting to set him free, the two fall in love. In the end, it's revealed that she and the amphibian man share some sort of biological connection as the scars on her neck turn out to be gills. They live happily ever after, it is assumed by Giles's voice-over at the end of the movie, which is exactly what you'd expect from a romantic fairy tale.I feel that this is a movie that, if you suspend your disbelief, will feel like a magical and beautiful fairy tale. If you start to question things, it'll seem stupid. I think both viewpoints are valid, and sometimes it's just whether the movie 'works' for you that you can suspend your disbelief. For example, I think David Lynch's Eraserhead is just dumb, but David Lynch's Mulholland Drive is also one of my favorite movies. In one movie, I was able to suspend my disbelief, in another, I I just couldn't.So yeah, If you see this as mute chick having sex with fish guy, this movie will suck. And yes, the twist lends some validity to the relationship, but I don't think it's enough if the movie doesn't 'work' for you. But if it does 'work' for you, the twist removes that gnawing back of your mind thought of 'she's having sex with a fish guy.'Outside of that...
Michael Shannon as Strickland ('Strict land'.... hmmm). Wow, he is just amazing in the movie. Everyone is great by Shannon is just perfect in his role.The music, especially Elisa's theme, has that nice dreamy, fairy-tale waltz, aquatic feel to it. Beautifully fits into the movie.The cinematography.The Easter eggs or connections you find (Elisa and the amphibian man both being mute, Elisa wearing more and more red as the movie goes on, amphibian man killing Strickland by slashing gills on his neck) make for an enjoyable second viewing.I think the only downside for me was the fantasy dance scene. I read it was meant to be an homage, and that's all well and good, but I found it 'cringy' and goofy and took me out of the movie for a bit, which was a shame.",8,0,5,1 June 2020
Vanilla Sky," This movie floored me
","We open with an aerial view of NYC with intermittent pauses of darkness and silence. David Aames (Cruise) wakes up and drives off to see a deserted NYC at 9AM. It's eerily quiet. But it's also just a dream and he wakes up again, and this time all is normal. But at that point, I realized that this movie is going to be a mindfu--. Boy, does it deliver.The movie can almost be cut into three pieces: the somewhat hokey beginning, the mindfu--ing middle portion, and the resolution that will make many go back to see it again. The hokey beginning shows Cruise living the life of a rich punk getting everything he wants, including Sofia Serrano (Cruz). They have an incredible non-sexual night together; one of those nights where two people connect. He falls for Serrano, which frustrates Gianni to no end, causing her to drive him off a bridge, disfiguring his face.The second part is filled with disjointed scenes where Cruise is in a jail cell talking with Dr. McCabe (Russell) about a murder while reliving the past. Things become less and less clear and soon the audience is completely confused as to what the hell is going on. But don't worry as when the secret is revealed, it explains much (though perhaps not all), and even does a nice job stringing in past scenes. I don't want to give anything away; you'll know what I mean when you see it.The movie isn't perfect, IMO. I wasn't crazy about Cruz, as some of the lines delivered seemed flat, and one scene where she runs away is almost comedic. Also, Crowe sometimes drowns the movie in music to the point of distraction. The first part does sort of lag, but only because it is supposed to establish the story so I don't fault that.Bottom line, this movie may require some patience in the beginning, but it totally captures you about 1/2-way into the movie and doesn't let you go. When it finally 'opened my eyes', I was sincerely shocked. I talked about the movie for close to an hour with friends. When a movie makes you think about it after it's over, that's the mark of a good movie. On par with Memento, but still not to the level of Mulholland Drive, Vanilla Sky will probably end up as one of my favorite movies of the year, and one of those movies that come up in conversations of movies that 'you gotta see'. 8/10.-Mark",7,0,0,16 December 2001
Amélie," Quaint, quirky, feel good, but not much more than that
","Amelie is a young woman who, early on, finds an old tin she found that belonged to a previous tenant while watching the news of Lady Diana's death. She decides at that moment to find the owner and, if he is thankful, she will decide to do good deeds.She eventually finds him, and he is thankful, so she promptly walks an old blind man across the street then describes various sights as they stroll along. She plays matchmaker to a regular and cigarette lady at the cafe where she works, she takes her father's gnome and sends it around the world (prompting him to go on a trip), finds love, pranks a grocery store manager who is mean to his assistant.The story is cute and quaint, like Amelie. It's quirky enough so that it feels novel and different from typical Hollywood movies. The story is feel-good, if a bit too schmaltzy, and is meant to leave a smile on your face.I did find the subplot with the cafe patron and cigarette lady a bit wasteful and a couple of the other subplots to be underdone. The whole romantic thing with her and the guy (forgot the name) was just okay for me.So yeah, again, it's cute, quirky, feel-good, and maybe temporarily uplifting. Is it a masterpiece? I don't think so. Will it change your perspective on the world? Likely not. It may affect you temporarily, much like a nice hollywood or political speech, but that generally doesn't last long. I enjoyed it, but it's not one of those 'OMG, you *have* to see this ' type of movie for me. 7/10.",7,0,0,28 June 2020
Gladiator," What the hell was so great about this movie?
","First of all, I'll give you that the movie was visually spectacular. Yeah, great visuals, great CGI. I'll even give you that Crowe and Phoenix acted well in the movie. I didn't think it was anything special, but fine, I'll give you that. But what the hell was the movie about? Basically, the tagline 'he kills and kills until he kills no more' applies to this movie. But it had no meaning. So what if his family was killed. Did anyone feel the pain outside of those stupid dream clips which is basically Ridley Scott's futile attempt to make you think about it? These characters were two dimensional. Maximus was the low-key uber-fighter. Phoenix's character was the ultimate evil. There was absolutely no story outside of who is Maximus going to fight next. Pro-wrestling offers more of a storyline.Hey, this was a good action flick, I'd even say a great action flick. But that's all it was. This movie, IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER (IMO), separated itself from any other action flick outside of the level of visual detail and perhaps superior acting. What bothers me is that this movie will probably beat out much better movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Traffic, and Wonderboys for best movie of 2000, according to the 'experts' at the Oscars. History will look back on this as a mistake. Good movie, yes. Oscar winner? No, not even Oscar nominee. 7/10.",7,0,0,22 March 2001
Gladiator," ... sound and fury signifying nothing
","Nice visuals and a feel of an epic isn't enough to un-lameify this movie. What the hell is it about? Some guy who kicks ass as a general kicks ass as a gladiator until he kicks supreme ass. Big deal. Where's the story? What's the story? Sure, there's that little blurb about his wife and child, but there was no emotion in it.This movie was a lame, lame knockoff of a much better Braveheart.",7,0,0,29 November 2000
Goodfellas," One of the best films ever made
","I live in Emeryville, California (near SF, CA, which is more well known than Emeryville), and one of my favorite ways to spend a couple of hours is to head over to Everett&Jones for Ribs and watch Goodfellas. From the beginning, it draws you in to the mafia life following Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) rise from childhood dreams of being a gangster along with Jimmy Conway (Robert DeNiro), and Tommy DeVito (Joe Pesci in an amazing role). From the beginning, Scorsese captures the romance and logic of being a gangster. Young Henry Hill saw the beauty of it all. 'It was out of respect' he says, when kids carried his mother's groceries all the way home for her. 'It was better than being president', he says. And why not? Gangsters seemed immune to police, law, having to pay bills. That's the beauty that draws you in. Pesci plays the role of a hot-tempered gangster which is Robin Hood on-target. You can tell early on that this is a man who probably got stepped on when younger, and craved the respect given to gangsters. That makes him the most volatile of the trio since he constantly wants the respect from everyone, but sometimes doesn't command it. DeNiro is, not surprisingly, great as Jimmy Conway, but between the central role that Liotta has and the character Pesci plays, DeNiro's character doesn't really stand out. That's not to say DeNiro didn't play the character well, just that the nature of his character, IMO, wasn't meant to stick out.The music is a wonderful complement to the story. The fluid camera shots are amazing, especially after multiple viewings. There's one in particular where it follows Henry and Karen on their first real date. It's amazing. There's also another scene where the piano exit of Layla plays in the background. It's one of my favorites in the movie.Geez, what else can be said. Great acting by everyone. The story flows like water. The characters are drawn perfectly and have a depth. You feel the rationale of these gangsters and even find yourself siding with them. No scene is wasted.This is easily a 10/10, and to some extent, makes me rethink some other movies that I've rated a 9 or 10. Taking from Spinal Tap, this movie should be an 11. It is on my top 5 list of favorite movies. I liked it more than The Godfather (it's close, though). I've seen it a dozen times and it loses nothing with each subsequent viewing. If anything, it gains more and more of my admiration.",10,0,0,27 May 2001
Valkyrie," Very nice historical thriller
","Tom Cruise plays Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg, a colonel in the Nazi army who believes Hitler's plan of world conquer is not going to work and decides that the only way to Germany to survive is to enact the Valkyrie plan. Part of that plan is to assassinate Hitler. The movie follows how they put the Valkyrie plan into place along with the plan for Stauffenberg to kill Hitler.First, some things to cast aside, in my opinion:
* Historical inaccuracies: I should say I'm by no means a history buff, but I have read that liberties were taken to add that thriller feel to the movie. I don't really see that so much as a problem. Yes, this is more thriller than documentary, but that's okay. I think the main points were kept true and what this movie will likely do is to get some people to research further. So any historical inaccuracy, to me at least, is no big deal. They never said this was 100% true and that shouldn't be expected from a Hollywood movie, where the main goal is to make money.
* The accents. Yes, they weren't German accents, but so what? A German accent in English is pointless, and keeping this in German would have turned some people away. I happen to enjoy subtitles in movies, but again, this is a Hollywood movie.
* Tom Cruise. I think this was done at the height of his scientology craze., which turned people away. His personal beliefs have no bearing in my opinion of the movie.Taking all that away, you're left with a pretty thrilling movie that's based on a true and interesting story. The scenes looked visually accurate, especially for people like me, who aren't history buffs. The acting was solid from pretty much everyone involved, and there were some major actors here. Tom Cruise's performance seemed just fine to me. Yes, he came out as very American, but again, I'm not looking for accuracy. I thought the pacing was nice and didn't feel any lag in the movie. In all, just a solid movie that I quite enjoyed.",8,0,0,16 June 2020
