Blade Runner 2049," A dismal train wreck right out of the gate
","We've all seen movies with epic plot holes but this one takes the cake. I cannot believe how bad this movie was. From start to finish it dragged. Walking out of the theater you will ask yourself this, 'What just happened back in there???' Trust me on this.... Save your money and go to Top Golf for the evening instead.",4,3,9,11 October 2017
