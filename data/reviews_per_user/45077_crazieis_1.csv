Howl's Moving Castle," An epic adventure of love, courage, and confidence.
","Enchanting! The more you watch it, the more you understand, as well as noticing the minor details you can't appreciate in the first viewing. It just made me feel strong, like I could accomplish great things. It gives you a warm sense of love and courage. I still don't understand why Sophie continually changes from old to young through out the movie...was it based on how other's saw her? I do wish I knew what happens after the end. Just amazing. The characters were unique, and Ghibli's movies manage to always have a more artistic and creative appeal than Disney(although i love Disney). I can't believe adults could conjure such beautiful imagination. The music is also perfect, it further enhances the mood.",9,2,3,31 December 2005
