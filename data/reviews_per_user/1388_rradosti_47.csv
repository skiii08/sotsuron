1/2 StarThis is a fantastic, edgy comedy masterpiece. It will make you laugh your guts out and force you to widen your eyes at the situations on screen.

0 StarsThis is a heartfelt coming of age story. I like the throwback and isolation it makes you feel, everyone has felt it at some point in middle or high school. I don't like how the end is explained, there is a great climax but they barely give you enough information letting you know what happened. Overall it's a good movie you've seen before with a different script and new set of characters.",4,1,6,11 February 2020

This is a revolutionary type of horror just like Shrek and onions this movie has many layers.
At times small amounts of Boredom can creep in the first time viewing solely because it's hard too follow and know exactly what's going on, I defiantly find watching it a 2nd or 3rd time to be really helpful with this. I love the wonder in the story and the unimaginable payoff at the end once it makes sense. My main complaint is I don't like the sense of unbelievability in the film, there were multiple moments where I thought to myself 'the cops would defiantly have more questions' or 'the school would defiantly call CPS and get that family checked out.' Over all amazing horror movie Best of the last few years and not one too miss!",8,1,3,3 January 2020

1/2 StarThis story cuts deep like a knife. It's the sad retelling of Aileen Wuornos, a film that really makes you feel bad for her even though it is titled and labeling her as a Monster. It's told extremely well with only a few slow points. The love story between Aileen and Shelby, it's touching and sad but this movie overall is truly a great watch.

This movie is great and what I think is an awesome installment. This is a film I watched over and over at one point in my life when I was younger. I love the comedy and the differing cast! I don't like how at times the sketches/scenes can feel stitched together or out of place. This sequel technically makes no sense due to Ray being a villain in the first Scary Movie, but I guess they let bygones be bygones. Over all a great addition!",7,1,1,26 February 2020

The film is really well done, the sets and crowds are great really setting the tone as a concert movie. I liked the characters and the back and forth energy between Samberg and Taccone.

This is a well done film, just not one for me.

But it quickly turned into what I call a 'halfsy' movie. A film that starts really strong but looses you somewhere halfway in.
I really liked the view of the future world which is what I believe our world might look like by 2150ish at the rate we are going. it's almost scary to look at it from that aspect.
I didn't like all the scenes toward the end that felt somewhat meaningless and I think the film could feel accomplished and complete without some of them. It also feels cliche and predictable at times.",4,0,1,3 January 2020

0 StarsThis is an interesting story that takes many different turns and literally changes every 40 minutes or so. I like following Alex and seeing A few years in his life that are traumatizing and stand out the most to him, it's also great to see him adapt. The movie just feels so long about midway through. Much longer than 2 hours. It's a bit sadistic so get your game face on if it's your first viewing.",5,0,4,22 March 2020

1/2 StarThis movie was better than I anticipated. I love the idea of a story surrounding the government hiding a creature like this in a lab. I almost feel like it could be something that has actually happened at some point in time. I don't like how unrealistic it is, like some of the most brilliant minds in the US would let janitors into secret labs leaving them alone to discover projects they are currently working on. I feel like low ranking or unliked men of the army would get the work no one wants. But I'm willing to look past these plot holes because other than that, it really is a touching film.",7,0,6,29 March 2020

1 StarThis is a very entertaining adaptation to Greg Sestero's book about the making of The Room. It gives any filmmaker that push he or she needs to be inspired and take their future into their own hands. TOO UNDERSTAND THIS MOVIE YOU HAVE TO SEE TOMMY WISEAU's FILM THE ROOM. There really isn't anything I don't like about this movie. It's relatable, got great music and a killer cast. Check out The Room and The Disaster Artist, they are inspiring films.",9,0,1,12 March 2020

I think this is a very clever satire with multiple lol moments. I love Jojo, it's really hard not to like him and seeing his strength throughout the story is so touching. At times it's really heart breaking and questions do rise, but it's a great movie.",6,0,0,4 March 2020

0 StarsThis film is really good, and grabs your attention in places you thought it might not quickly. The story is beautiful, but at points I wish there was a little more clarity. I love the Italian vibe throughout and no matter how you put it, Italians can always make something funny. Even though Doc seems very well read and literate, he still almost seems dumb and oblivious, I just wish he has a tiny bit more street smarts/common sense. Great movie over all!",7,0,0,1 April 2020

This movie is hard to follow at first, but gets easier to understand as time marches on. Although jumping back and forth from present and past defiantly makes the story a little harder to understand at first, you eventually realize what's going on. The acting is great, and from what I've read, It's mostly accurate to the real story of Zuck. Great but slow.",6,0,2,7 April 2020
