Alien 3," Holding your own with other aliens.
","So you too want to direct an Alien film.  Best thing to do is not follow Ridley Scott and/or James Cameron.  If this cannot be avoided (and hello! it can't)  proceed with being creative,  because it won't matter anyway.I am a huge fan of the Alien franchise.  Alien was my favorite show when I was a kid, I don't mean when I was 15 more like when I was 5.  So back in '92 when this installment bombed at the box office,  I was sad.  I never went to see it because of what others told me, like Ripley dies and we are again limited to one Alien.  So what's the point?I did not see this until  a year ago. Oh it is oh, so cool.  So good.  It didn't see until after I saw 'Fight Club' and realizing what a great man David Fincher was.  It is one of those times when you just need to ignore other's negative comments.I cannot comment enough on everything that makes it a perfect ending to the series.  The reversal of being trapped with the beast again.  The doom that lines ahead that we know so much of.  Ripley becomes more of a character as the only  female on the planet.  It is quite the thriller to the end.  The continuation of the weapons department valuing something so ugly and vile or humanity.  It was great as far as filmmaking.  Aliens was great as far as entertainment.  See the difference?  Anyways, don't be thrown off.  Give it more than a chance.  It is deviant,  but holds it's own.",10,4,7,28 June 2001
Requiem for a Dream," Disturbing movie
","This was an excellent film. If you like propaganda. For your drug education you will learn: ===> Drugs will give a sweet high for a short time ===> You believe you can do anything!!! (on drugs) ===> And you will do ANYTHING -for drugs (yes, even that) ===> Drugs will take (over) your life and destroy your dreams ===> Drugs will leave you writing in pain in the fetal position ===> There are no happy endings for those on drugsI watched this back in 2001 (NC-17 version). Recently I re-watched the last ten minutes (darn youtube). The film making, the quick cuts, the close ups, the integrated stories, the escalating music score, Jennifer Connelly's beauty and Keith David's gaping teeth as living props: this is superior film making. Every trick in the book was used, and it worked without seeming contrived. Aronofsky was a genius at creating that intense trapped drug feeling for the audience. The intense fear I felt was real. I was doomed and I won't/don't do drugs! I hated what I felt at the end of this movie. I don't think I'll ever watch this film again. If the object of this movie was to scare the holy crap out of me- it worked. It also led me to believe that when a close family member was an addict, there was no answer. They would simply be a struggling addict, forever. Not true!!! ===> There are happy endings. Don't do drugs or get help. If this is a lie that tells the truth, I want the whole truth.",7,0,2,2 July 2012
Fight Club," Have you heard about Tyler Durden? v-2.0
","This movie, like many other Fincher film's, leave me with a restlessness. Like someone is actively taking my life away from me. If I don't stand up and claim it and DO SOMETHING with it than I might as well be dead. There is no greater love story than this one. A perfect film. The first 30 minutes of the film sets up life as it is. As we accept it. One man tries to find a place in the world. What subjects himself to is no longer living a full, happy, honest life. Tyler, the great savior, shows us the way it ought to be. And what we can become. I asked back in 2000 'Question this: In 5 years see how many people will be talking about The Sixth Sense and then ask who has ever heard of the genius..........Tyler Durden.' ;) Seriously. This movie still reigns as the GOD of all that is cool and disposable.",10,0,1,25 October 2000
The Descent," Creature Feature Flick
","So a 1950's creature feature flick. But at least in the 1950's they would have sold it as that. The movie would be better named as 'the attack of the mole people.' The summary lies, it isn't a descent into a cave from hell or have any kid of mental struggle that we get twisted into. Not at all! The girls get lost in the cave, find monsters, try to escape.However, the Actresses pulled it together and were not cheesy and dumb. They for the most part they were quite clever and watchable. Unless one of them becomes super famous and wins an Oscar or marries a soccer player, not worth mentioning again. It is intense and needs a soundtrack. Consider it a alternate on Halloween and you get to the video store too late for any of the popular favs.",5,2,3,15 August 2006
