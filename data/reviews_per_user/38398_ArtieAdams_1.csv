Alien 3," The more 'Artsy' sci-fi horror film
","Ok, I'm assuming everyone here has seen this 10-year old movie, but if you haven't please read someone else's review.The first time I watched this film I have to admit, I was a bit let down - no real action scenes, pretty standard special effects and my biggest beef was who really cares what happens to all these murderers on prisoner island anyway?Then a few years later, I re-watched it in film class, and have to admit - from a cinematography standpoint it became my favorite.The graphic close ups that catch you off guard, the creepy symbolisms in many of the violent scenes (The death by fan scene is my fave, both graphically and symbolically.Mandalas rock!)The story is pure mythology - the religious allusions alone make this film a melting pot of interpretation - just think of the many ways you can equate Ripley to Jesus. I'm not religious, but I really love symbolisms.In short - if you want people blowing up aliens and running through tunnels rent Aliens or Resurrection (although the identity issues in Resurrection make it quite fun to interpret too) I you want horror with a more philosophical bite to it try Alien 3 out, but remember it's an acquired taste.",Null,1,3,13 September 2002
