First Man," One heck of a movie.
","I remember seeing the trailers, being dismayed that the first actual movie about the moon landing was looking to be a mess of grainy shakycam. So I put off seeing it in the cinema. Ultimately it was too late and I had to wait for home video. And while I do have a decent home cinema system, I do kind of regret not seeing it on a giant venue.The camera is shaky. Yes. And I am very hard to convince that a shaky camera is necessary. But. Honestly. It fit. I did get the sense of the claustrophobic experience inside those tiny capsules. Only having a tiny window to see anything. When things get out of control the camerawork is still readable. And the sound matches the visuals.I have recently seen a similar attempt from Russian filmmakers to try to portray Gagarin on film. That was one misguided effort of propagandistic drivel. I mean. He probably was a great guy. But the film was dreary and formulaic... I feared that this film about Armstrong would fall into that same trap. But no. There was actual competence in the writing here.And the scenes on the moon itself. Somewhat short. But at least they opened up the framing, let it be steady, and bumped the stock from grainy 16mm to glorious 70 mm horizontal IMAX.One thing I do wish is that more of the film did depict details of the actual flight and mission. But then again... I'd probably prefer a complete recreation spanning 10 * hour long pretty uneventful episodes of a HBO show. Chronicling one day of mission time each episode or something like that. This is a one night movie and I am very happy with what I did get to see.",8,0,2,2 March 2019
Mission: Impossible III," he's really in love with that telephoto-shaky-shaky, get a steady-cam or tripod goddammit!... I'd rather watch True Lies again...
","I had nothing to do last night so I thought, Why not watch MI3 at the local cinema? an hour later I sat down, turned of my cell-phone and the big silver-screen came to life...And the first thing we get is the part we saw in the commercial and I went, 'Hey, this is nice, just get that trailer-stuff out of the way so we would get all new stuff, just like in MGS2 where suddenly the main character was switched and the whole plot turned while not showing it in the trailers... nice and unexpected' but then I realized, it's going to be another one of those flashback-flicks.And that it was, and another thing that annoyed me, was that they never used the theme-song to it's full potential, hell, we didn't get any real MI-themed events at all until the Vatican sequence...Then we have the Telephoto-shaky-shaky, that I mentioned in the review summary, And this director is really in love with it. And why shouldn't he, it's a trademark from his TV-series... well no, for me, it got annoying. every action-part had it, and it smashed everything about the MI-theme... which is, these guys are pro's, they are smooth and slick in their movements... sometimes, in this movie, it was hard to guess what exactly it was that I was watching...CGI? don't use it... the Berlin-helicopter-chase-through-the-field-of-windmills wasn't used nearly enough to it's potential. If SW3 taught us anything, it is that CGI is not good. It belongs to the dark side.The plot? think True Lies but done by that pearl harbor guy... it was all painfully obvious... the agent/unknowing-wife relation, the attack on the bridge, everything...This is basically a film done by the wrong type of director...On a side-note. When I saw the trailer I got the impulse to begin a script on a action piece myself... When I saw the movie I realized that I had foreseen the whole plot already :S One funny part though... I couldn't stop giggle when I saw Simon Pegg as the investigator/scientist that spoke of the anti-god-thing...",3,4,13,7 May 2006
BlacKkKlansman," A good film that sadly will only play to the choir
","Hey, Spike Lee made a whacky film about a black cop going undercover as a Klansman... This is going to be a great romp!Well... It is quite a ride. But if you're expecting something out of Django Unchanged's Klansman sequence, you may be dissapointed. At first. But what we got instead was well worth the time. Even though our black hero never actually dons the robes himself.From the use of old film classics where the underlying racism is apparent to the speeches of white supremacists from all over the spectrum we do get kind of an unflinching view of their beliefs and convictions. But it does get to balance things with the Black Power movement as well. Showing that neither side are as productive as they claim, allthough, the weight is heavier on the white power side throughout, as in real life. The black side talks about revolutions... The klansmen are the guys who actually takes to violence. Harassment and violence is very much directed at the black for no good reason.So while Spike does no attempt at hiding the political agenda (blatant references to modern politics abound). He is presenting a playground that is a little grey at the first glance. But by the time the ending montage rolls it's hard to have any sympathy for the Klan and its followers.The films biggest downside is that being so blatant it'll probably alienate the crowd who really needs the b___h-slap the film provides. Does that make the film bas in itself? No. The pro equality movements needs reminders too.Just don't expect a blaxploitation romp. You need a more open mind than that. It is entertaining though, so still watch it! :)",8,6,12,18 October 2018
Annihilation," It stays in my mind. Wee-aa-wee-ooohh... Uuh!
","Ok. I am about to blaspheme. But I did spend a good chunk of the day rewatching both this film and Tarkovsky's Stalker. And while I struggled to get through the old Russian epic I had no problem with this newer film.Sure, Garland (director of the film) and Vandermeer (writer of the book) do claim that Annihilation wasn't an attempt to remake Stalker or Roadside Picnic, but the similarities are hard to ignore. As is the older H.P. Lovecraft story The Color From Out Of Space (where a meteorlike object creates havoc around the impact crater, deforming and mutating both flora and fauna, as well as emitting an otherworldly color not before seen by man)..It is a fascinating subject for me to explore in these stories. Where alien entities not so much invade as just exist and we are forced to try and find out what makes the uninvited neighbours tick. Even when it may be represented by a skull-faced giant bear that uses human death screams as its hunting lure (guaranteed nightmare fuel there) or as seemingly harmless beautiful floral arrangements.Intersperse that with combinations of Cosmic Horror like in The Thing, and pure old school Cronenbergian BodyHorror the characters end up trusting noone and no thing as both minds and bodies disintegrate throughout the tale.If you didn't pick up on it yet, I friggin love this film. From the expertly handled effects and visuals to the otherworldly musical notes on the soundtrack. If I were to nitpick I kind of feel that the flash forward interview scenes that are intercut from the start was a bit unnecessary.Now, after Dredd, Ex Machina and now Annihilation I can hardly wait to see what Alex Garland decides to tackle next as he is one of the most interesting voices in Movie SciFi right at the moment.",9,1,2,22 October 2018
