Blade Runner 2049," One of my favorite movies of this year!
","Blade Runner 2049 definitely took me by surprise by being one of my favorite movies of this year. At first I was skeptical about the 2 hour and 45 minute screen time and was prepared to sit thru many boring scenes. However, in the end I felt the movie did a great job making the time go by very fast. Could it have been shorter? Yes. However, I'm glad it wasn't. There were so many scenes that were crucial to the plot and to the movie. Everything adding together into one big scene of reveal that makes the audience go 'ahhh'. Those long scenes of silence in the movie were so intense and heart pounding. If there is one thing that this movie utilized perfect, it would be silence. Definitely a must watch in my book.",8,1,8,13 October 2017
Ant-Man," If you've always been a marvel movie fan, then you will like this one as well!
","I'm looking at all these reviews on IMDb and I see that literally every review has around 50% down votes. I think people are mostly divided on their views for this movie; some people complained about the fight scenes while others complimented the CGI and vice versa. I was hesitant to go see it after reading the reviews, but I shoved all those negative thoughts out of my head and went regardless. I'm really glad that I went. I wasn't a huge fan of Marvel and DC superheroes at first â€“ I'm more of an anime/manga lover, but over the years all these superhero movies grew on me and I've since caught up on all of them. I went into this movie knowing basically nothing about the background of Ant-Man and I followed along with the plot just fine. The movie describes Ant-man's humble beginnings very well and I'm sure that kids of all ages will be able to follow along with the plot just fine. This movie is meant for people of all ages, but if you ask me, I think it's leaning just a little bit towards the younger generation. If I remember correctly (it's been awhile since I've last seen the movie), I don't think there were any nudity or sex scenes. The jokes definitely feel like Marvel jokes; light-hearted, fast pace, quick- wit, and really capitalizing on 'cool' moments. I personally thought that the action scenes and CGI were phenomenal. People underestimate how hard it is to make a unique character such as Ant-Man work on the big screen and I think they did a fantastic job. The fight scenes are very innovative, his transformations during the fights opens up a lot of possibility and brings variety to the table. The supporting casts were great as well; Michael Pena tried way too hard to be funny, but it still came out alright. Evangeline Lilly played Hope PERFECTLY. I really like her in this role and I'm glad they are initiating her into the marvel universe.In conclusion, if you are the type of person that really likes the Marvel movie franchises, then I think you should give this movie a chance. I really liked it and I'm sure most of you will too.",8,3,8,16 August 2015
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," ~~Tom Cruise doing what he does best~~
","Tom Cruise is the craziest actor in the world. You have to admire that kind of dedication he has for his craft; you know he loves what he does. Doing his own stunts is what is making Mission Impossible differ from other spy movies like James Bond. Seeing a close-up of his facial expressions as the action went on really pulls you into the scene. One thing you can't deny is that this movie is filled an immense amount of action. Fight scenes, assassinations, car chases, gun fights; this movie has it all! If you enjoyed the previous Mission Impossible movies, then you can't go wrong with this one because it brings the game to a whole new level. Whoever decided to make Simon Pegg the main supporting actor is a genius! Every word that came out of his mouth was hilarious.The reason that I took off a star for this movie was because of the predictability of the story. Like many spy movies, the story-line just seemed so generic. An evil organization tries to cause trouble for the world and its up to the world's best secret agent to try and take them down. On the way he falls in love with a beautiful female assassin and they team up to try and foil the plans of said evil organization (roll eyes).In conclusion, even though the story line was predictable, it didn't take away from the whole experience of watching the movie. Some of the supporting casts were great even though they seemed to provide more of a comedic relief than actually having an impact on the show, and Tom Cruise performed phenomenal as ever.",8,0,2,14 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Everything was great, but the fight at the end was disappointing
","Second paragraph of this review contains ending fight spoilers*The movie itself was great on so many aspects. The practical effects were absolutely amazing--if I remember correctly, there must have been only a couple of CGI monster/aliens, which was understandable. The practical effects and cinematography really brought a different atmosphere and a sense of realism to the movie. The actors of Finn (John Boyega) and Rey (Daisy Ridley) did a fantastic job as well. Rey herself has proved to be a strong and self-dependent female lead and I for one really like the new characters introduced in this movie. What I really like the most about both these actors are their facial expressions. They're amazing at depicting realistic emotions on their face that really makes you believe in their acting.*Warning: spoilers from here on out*Although the movie was overall enjoyable, I did have one major gripe with it. The fight at the end of the movie between Kylo Ren and Rey left a sour taste in my mouth. I can understand if she and Finn teamed up to defeat him after a long fight, but Rey absolutely obliterated Kylo Ren in the light-saber fight. She had no prior training, but apparently, closing your eyes and believing in the force for 5 seconds makes you a Jedi master. It was so one-sided that at the end of the fight I felt like that kid from the Simpsons saying, 'Stop! Stop, he's already dead' while crying.I guess I'm just being nit picky at this point, but overall, I'm still very satisfied with the movie. The cinematography was fantastic and casts were amazing. I was really absorbed into the Star Wars atmosphere and it met most of my expectations.",9,2,24,1 January 2016
