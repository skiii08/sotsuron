Mission: Impossible III," JJ Abrams Makes This Film
","I honestly believe Abrams was the godsend that not only kept this film from being junk but also made it nothing but entertaining to watch. I can only stand Tom Cruise so much as the director he works with know how to control his personality and Abrams did as good a job as anyone I've seen.Much of it will feel familiar to anyone who's a fan of Alias, MI:3 uses the same spy interaction with much of the tech used feeling the same. The plot felt like an expensive Alias episode, not that there was anything wrong with that. So, unlike what John Woo did with the second of the series the action here is believable and therefore exciting.I don't know if there are any hardcore fans of Mission Impossible but I believe they will enjoy this installment.",10,6,13,27 April 2006
