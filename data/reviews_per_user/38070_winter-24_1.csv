The Blair Witch Project," A Waste Film That Could Be used For Something Better
","This has to be the worst movie that I've ever seen! They tried to make this a believable documentary, but failed miserably. There were so many mistakes that a first year film student should cringe. Everyone that was interviewed had no idea what the heck they were supposed to be saying, and you'd think that the actors graduated from the William Shatner academy. I really wanted to laugh through the entire movie because it was that bad! I found the movie lacking in plot, in dialogue, in, well basically everything! A lot of the people I know said that it was the best movie ever, but they are all what you'd call freaks and weirdos that have no thing to do with any use of their brain anyways. So I guess if you fit into that category, it's your kind of movie.",1,1,3,24 August 1999
