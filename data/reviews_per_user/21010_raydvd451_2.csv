Kill Bill: Vol. 2," YIN/....YANG..BANG.. ! QT.
","WOW , This movie is incredable. As Kill Bill Vol 1 was all out action and simplistic dialogue so Kill Bill Vol 2 was a journey into the personas of all the main characters. i cant believe people are saying that they liked the first film but hated the second . the 2 films are QT,s double edged 'sword' his yin and yang of his Film Life. Vol 1 is his male/ yang side ,all testosterone and bang ! bang ! explosive side . Vol 2 is his female/ yin side , delving more deeply into the reasons and emotions of why The Bride is hell bent on seeking to 'Kill Bill !'. All the performances are great but Uma and david are absolutely outstanding Plus Michael Parks who i hardly recognized asa 70 year old mexican. The music is the soul of both films and demonstrates thats QT is the master of the record collection ! My fav scene is  probably when The Bride remembers her teachings of Pai Mei ,this scene got the hairs to stand up on the back of my kneck ! but there are too many to mention and i recommend you find out the gems for yourself. Happy Movie Going !",10,0,1,25 April 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Why i go to the movies
","Where do i begin ? I am not an articulate writer so please bear with me, i have seen many, many movies in my time, different languages, genres and themes.There are good movies, bad movies and indifferent ones.But there are few master pieces, and even fewer modern ones, and Return of the King is a true master-piece of cinema.It would be a truly cold person that would not be touched by the characters in these 3 films and it doesn't matter that it is set in a fantasy environment as in all films if we cannot relate with the characters then there is no soul in the screen. Everone involved in ROTK is at the top of their game and the Academy where spot on to award all the 'gold guys' that were on offer to them. It does have it flaws maybe ( soem say the ending was a bit drawn out) but hey , why would you want to leave middle earth when you love being in this place.Thank You to Peter Jackson and co for filling my heart with wonder once more i look at the silver screen !",10,1,4,21 November 2004
