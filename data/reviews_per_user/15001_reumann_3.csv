Minority Report," X-Files/6thSense/Matrix meets Presumed Innocent
",If you like suspense thrillers with some plot twists in a slightly futuristic world setting this movie is for you. The movie reminded me of presumed innocent but set in the future with cool philosophical/cultural aspects to contend with. Excellent movie.,10,0,0,30 July 2002
The Game," Would have been a good movie had the ending revealed something plausible.
","This movie will keep you not wanting to get up from your couch as this is one of those movies where you are hanging on just waiting to the explanation of why things are happening as they are. HOWEVER, The problem is when you finally get that explanation and you actually think about it you'll be upset. The ending reveals an answer that is so incredibly unplausible that it's an insult to the viewers intelligence. The movie 'Speed' was more believable than this movie.",5,1,2,18 August 2001
Blade Runner," Artsy fartsy movie - plots deeper on star trek
","I fail to see why people like this movie other than reasons based on 'Wow, wasn't the cinematography awesome.' Sure the cinematography was good I guess, but if the plot doesn't keep up than it's a waste in my opinion. The movie brings up the classic concept of 'what does it mean to be human,' but then never really creates any interesting twists or plot development based on this. I doubt even back in '82 the concept of dealing with artificial life was 'that' novel. I've seen old Star Treks that dealt with the issue. Strip out all the dark lighting, rain, and slum shots and what do you have? - a boring movie. It got so old afer a while seeing the flying police cars over rainy slums. Then inside buildings rays of light kept flashing in as if from search lights. Everything seemed so artificial and it was as if the director was just wasting my time.",2,15,38,7 November 2004
