Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," You HAVE to see this movie!!!
","I loved it.  I don't want to give it away for those of you who haven't seen it yet, but it's an incredible show.  It explains a lot about Darth Vader's personality and is a great history lesson.  GO SEE IT  -- TWICE!!",10,5,7,21 May 1999
