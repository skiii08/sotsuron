Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," How they have destroyed the spirit of star wars
","If you want to know the physical component of the force...I have not found the force in this film, except in this ridiculous blood analysis.No soul, no suspense, just some beautiful images, and Nathalie Portman.
