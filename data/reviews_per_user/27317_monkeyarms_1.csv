The Ring," Wow, such a bad movie that out of a group of 10, only one liked it.
","That is why this movie gets one star.  Some of us were convinced to skip class to see this movie, and they were truly regretting it.  It takes a pretty awful movie to have a person wishing he were in class. The only thing effective in this movie were the 'shockers'--the cut to scenes that began with a loud noise.  At least i jumped.  Otherwise this was a moronic movie with a convoluded storyline that made no sense.  And as others have noted, the ending was so completely forced that i wanted to force a pencil through my head.  So completely forced that i felt the need to use a stupid play of words. The sad thing was that the movie had true potential.  But all it did was sit in front of me saying, 'Hello, i'm a psychological thriller.  I want to play with your head and make you scared.'  But it takes more than that to scare a person. Just as in some suspensful movies, the suspenseful moments are overplayed to the point that they aren't truly suspenseful.  The Ring suffered this same problem: scary moments were so played up that they ceased to be scary and caused me to laugh. To be honest the acting is really not too shabby.  Its good, really.  But it was wasted on a poorly executed flick. Time to research the Japanese version to see if it avoided the pitfalls of the American show.",1,0,2,24 October 2002
