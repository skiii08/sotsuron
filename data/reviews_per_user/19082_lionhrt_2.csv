The Avengers," Great effects wasted on a kindergarten movie
","I really enjoyed the earlier ones but this was really dumbed down.With very little effort they could have made this a great movie.You cannot defy laws of physics in special effects or it becomes completely 5 year old cartoon nonsense. That is the problem here. Be logical with the scenes instead of being lazy. The graphics capability is there so don't cheapen it by taking short cuts.It distracts from the entire movie.That, and great effects mixed in with the most primitive of video overdubbing. In many scenes you can plainly see the backdrop with people standing in front of it. You'd think you were watching a 1940s film with overdubbing ... geeesh.Come on, do it right or don't do it at all.",2,10,19,29 June 2013
Captain Marvel," Nothing Spectacular
","I get tired of the same type animations and special effects over and over and over. The plot was OK, but predictable.This one was obviously trying to make a statement on equality for women which I found boorish. Why do we now feel the need to promote women in combat and desensitizing everyone so they think it is normal for a woman to get slugged in the face?Seriously, this type of action movie hasn't really changed since Star Wars in an age long long ago.",6,3,5,18 March 2019
