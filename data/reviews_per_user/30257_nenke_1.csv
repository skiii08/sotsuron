Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Nice Graphics, shame about the plot
","Having seen the original three in their first release I was disappointed by Phantom Menace.   The graphics and special effects were stunning, but the plot was very thin and transparent.   Darth Sidious was a sad waste of a great looking bad guy.   Not a patch on the menace and style of Darth Vader!",3,0,1,19 March 2000
