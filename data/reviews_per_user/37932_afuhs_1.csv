Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Visually unsettling
","It's always nice to be able to tell if the actors are walking on a real set as opposed to a computer generator environment.  Considering the visual mastery of the originals, this new addition to the Star Wars anthology provides computerized visual effects that prove unpleasing to the eye.The new characters featured in this overly-hyped flick are just as unsettling as the visuals and at times they are down right annoying.  I feel safe in saying that there was not even one character that the audience could truly empathize with.In conclusion, with poor visuals, characters and character development, and a shaky plot, this Star Wars prequel is a disgraceful outcast from that galaxy from a long time ago, far, far away.",2,0,1,19 October 2000
