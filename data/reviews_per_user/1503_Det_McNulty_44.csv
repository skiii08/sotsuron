Saturday Night Fever," Beautifully Defines An Era On The Backdrop Of A Realistic Class Study and Dynamic Music
","Although it may seem dated and cheesy to some viewers today Saturday Night Fever remains one of the most underrated examples of '70s pop-culture. It is undoubtedly the quintessential dance flick and remains one of the most entertaining films of all-time. Yet, behind all the music and entertaining aura you are actually viewing a drama studying the American class system and young rebellion. Though at times it is slightly exaggerated, it still manages to capture a vast amount of authenticity and ultimately the sights and sounds of the time.Saturday Night Fever follows self-proclaimed 'dance king' Tony Manero (John Travolta) and his love of dancing and the trials and tribulations of his life in the Bronx. He soon meets an arrogant fellow dancer named Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney). Quickly becoming attracted and influenced by the women he starts questioning the way he lives his life.The film is not always upbeat and at times can be depressing, particularly the scenes depicting peer-pressure. Although both have their differences, both are very alike and ultimately want to be something 'big'. There are also the elements of jealously, rivalry, religion, rebellion, respect and racism added into the film. This captures the realism of the time and with more accuracy and honesty than a lot of films. Just take a look at the brief scene where Tony is on the tube, this is an oddly poignant, effecting and compelling scene presenting Tony's confused emotions.Saturday Night Fever still carries the vibe, rhythm and atmosphere it did back in '77. It remains one of the most influential films for both the film-world and pop-culture. Infamously holding some of the greatest dance sequences ever committed film; you can feel the energy, emotions, time and determination that were spent perfecting the dance scenes to the finest detail. The lighting is perfect at creating the 'disco world', the set-piece of the 2001 Disco is one of the film's many iconic highlights.John Travolta dedicates himself to his dancing and character, fitting the role with a graceful ease. The film goes into depth at studying characters too, it shows how desperate everyone is to fit in and be able to make an impressive image. The fantastic shots on character's feet show the 'strut' in their walk, representing their desire to maintain their reputation of being 'cool'. All the characters want to be something, while a lot of them will never add up to anything due to their working-class backgrounds. There are a fair amount of American social-comments scattered throughout the film and retaining a surprising amount of intelligent value.The gloriously groovy and funky soundtrack is possibly the film's finest element. The music accompanies the dance sequences with an amazing amount of memorably robust imagery. The use of The Bee Gees' music is wonderful to listen to and also for helping to create an ambiguous atmosphere of love, drugs and sex. The shooting techniques in the disco are magnificent for filming the dance scenes and fit perfectly alongside the other technical elements.Saturday Night Fever is a far more professional film than one might expect, it has intelligence as well as entertainment, which is something that makes a more than just admirable achievement. It is a truly remarkable triumph and a film that deserves more appreciation than it gets.",8,73,85,20 March 2007
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," It Could Have Been Great If It Had More Substance
","I'm a big Quentin Tarantino and seeing all of his films this would have to be my least favourite. Kill Bill: Volume 2 still manages to create a good ending to the self titled 'Roaring Rampage Of Revenge'. Like the first film it lacks the substance needed to gain a higher score, yes the movie is stylish, but the phrase 'Style over substance' comes to mind. Unlike the first film which was a blood-thirsty satire, the sequel is surprisingly nothing like the first film. It does not contain the same kind of fight scenes as the first film and tends to reply more on the acting and visual flare Much of the movie is stolen, it's supposed to be a tribute. But things such Ennio Morricone's score are stolen as well as some notable others. Unlike other Quentin Tarantino where he wonderfully references cinema this feels more stolen. A lot of the film felt very silly and un-satisfying for example some of the deaths are short which is disappointing seeing as Quentin Tarantino has managed to create really crazy death scenes in his previous masterpieces.Uma Thurman once again steals the show and plays along side great actors like Michael Madsen. Now I'm normally a great fan of Michael Madsen, but this was a different matter. His performance felt clumsy and lacked depth/creativity to his previous past roles. A prime example would be none other than his performance as Mr. Blonde which for me goes down in my own personal favourite movie characters. His performance in Kill Bill: Volume 2 was a different matter. I felt a little unsatisfied after Kill Bill: Volume 2 after being entertained by Volume 1. My favourite scene was probably when Uma Thurman (The Bride) finally met up with Bill and learnt the truth, it was very interesting. I also loved the scene re capturing what happened at the wedding rehearsal it felt very lonely and tranquil with the black and white photography.One thing I did find impressive was the direction, it was very precise and held a lot of detail to the scenery and atmosphere that was in the movie. The movie mixes Spaghetti Western and Samurai Action to create something that is slightly operatic. The movies pace is very different to other films and holds few surprises. People call the movie 'emotional', I would definitely not say that, I found it more dramatic because it was so over the top. The movie still managed to be a lot deeper than the previous instalment, but still did not live up to Volume 1.",8,1,4,9 July 2006
Vertigo," One Of The Many Films Which Personifies Hitchcock's Legacy
","Many would argue that Vertigo is Hitchcock's true triumph, the film which defines his work and a film which has been a major influence on cinema as a whole. Vertigo is famous for many reasons; it is famous for being both a masterpiece and for being one of the most sexually-obsessive films ever made. As with most Hitchcock films sex is a frequently occurring and underlying theme, Hitchcock uses sexuality to propel the key narrative. Personally, I see Vertigo as an example of male-lust, obsession and perversion. Some might go as far as saying Vertigo is about Hitchcock's own attraction to women, which in Vertigo is dangerously perverse. Vertigo is a film which is open to interpretation and one which requires the utmost concentration. To fully gain the film's brilliance you need to first re-watch it, as the common trend is to be perplexed by the film's complex narrative structure.Vertigo continues to be one of the optimal psychological thrillers, a film which has stood the test of time and becomes greater and greater with age. Vertigo is the tale of 'Scottie' (played by James Stewart), a San Francisco policeman who is haunted by his severe acrophobia, which is caused from the guilt of an accidental death he feels responsible for. Due to Scott's condition he feels confined to secluding himself from police work, until an old friend asks him a favour. The favour is to 'spy' on his beautiful wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who he has become suspicious off due to the idea that she is possessed by a dead relative. So, Scottie tracks down Madeline, while quickly becoming pulled inside a mysterious and menacing world of lies and obsession.There are countless occurring themes throughout Hitchcock's films, which include mistaken identity, voyeurism, obsession, sexual compulsion, reliance, absurdity, paradoxes, irony and perversion. All of these contribute to making Hitchcock's films some of the most analytically accessible. Vertigo is an example of just how fierce Hitchcock can be through the harsh tones that he has etched into the film. The delicate moments of brief intimacy in Vertigo are ones which become abruptly destroyed by painful sorrow. These moments are devastating, as you are watching a man become more and more entranced by a woman he is failing to grasp.Hitchcock uses hypnotically mesmerising camera work and dizzying lens filtering to create an unbearably ominous 'Hitchcockian' environment. The stark colours, which are wonderfully vibrant, help to create a sincere mood of looming menace and tension. The use of perspective distortion (most notably the Dolly zoom) is another factor of the sublime skill behind the camera. When establishing the film's meaning you have to carefully annotate the use of colours, shadows and mirrors, which are all, used as metaphors for the protagonist's emotions and help to craft Scottie as one of the most multi-dimensional characters in cinematic history.With the additional blending of Bernard Herrmann's score you find yet another addition to add to the film's distinguishable quality at creating an extremely polarising and cold ambiance. Finally, you have the outstanding set-pieces and one in particular which will linger in the depths of your mind for eternity. What makes the set-pieces so perfect is how they are so remarkably appropriate for the essence of each scene.The acting from the entire cast is indistinguishable, in the sense that the acting is so sublime that it is actually too difficult to truly say who gave a better performance than the other. Although, I will certainly express how James Stewart's surprising casting as a fairly menacing character is one which remains one of the most unexpectedly perfected performances of all-time. He slides into the character with a cold-hearted and unnerving stance, providing insight into a multi-dimensional character which can be scrutinised to the finest detail for hours on end. Though, it is still not James Stewart's greatest performance (I would give It's a Wonderful Life the edge) it is unquestionably the finest film he ever starred in.Vertigo is the film which signifies Hitchcock's own persona, while categorically remaining his ultimate masterpiece. Few films can succeed in captivating and entrancing countless emotions upon its viewer. Vertigo is cinematic flawlessness.",10,6,7,20 May 2007
Requiem for a Dream," Visually Arresting and Emotionally Devastating, 'Requiem for a Dream' Strikes The Viewer With Audacious Pragmatism
","Director Darren Aronofsky's first feature-film, Pi was his critically-hailed and disturbingly warped vision of a troubled genius. Requiem for a Dream is just as troubling and carries even more critical acclaim, with its powerhouse image of spiralling drug abuse. Commonly referred to as a 'drug film', Requiem for a Dream does not take the same path as other drug films, instead it is an entirely different way of looking at a harrowing situation. Adapted from Hubert Selby's novel, Requiem for a Dream focuses on four drug abusers, who are all in some related to one-an-other. The film illustrates their decaying lives rapidly turning into both mental and physical turmoil. While the film's main focus is the affect of drug addiction on a person's mind and body, it is also a film studying other forms of addiction and self-denial.Requiem for a Dream is a film which succeeds in being an excellent anti-drug feature, depicting the utmost devastation of drug abuse. Packed to the brim with some of the most innovative film-making in modern cinema it is impossible to deny the film's audacity and glaringly distinct nature. The kinetic, music-video style editing helps to convey a fractured existence, even though at times it is somewhat indulgently overused. The editing, one of the film's most infamous features is undeniably great and is clearly the film's primary technical achievement. Along with the images of the protagonist's dilated pupils the film feels entirely distorted, which is a magnificent method of creating the surreal environment which the film quite literally imposes upon its viewer. Even with its 'MTV editing' the film still does not feel as though it is trivialising its content. The cinematography of Requiem for a Dream has an almost hypnotic feel behind its fierce, polarising images of self-destruction through deprivation, which I believe suits the mood of the piece. With the addition of its haunting score -which certainly feels relevant to the film's environment- Darren Aronofsky succeeds at crafting a film which goes against the generalised mould.Arguably, the film could be interpreted as nihilistic, however I simply see Requiem for a Dream as attempt to express the lack of hope for the character's addictions, and their denial is evidently making their addictions more dangerous. What is special is how the viewer is able to pity and feel empathy for foolish degenerates who have cast themselves into squalor. The performances are painstakingly heartbreaking and horribly honest. Both actors and actresses display their talent in Requiem for a Dream, particularly that of Ellen Burstyn, who gives a nerve-shattering performance of a women who is both addicted to the ideas of fame (the false American dream, something which the film subtly attacks through the subtext of its script), popularity and weight-slimming drugs which give her a reason to 'get up in the morning'. Jared Leto, Jennifer Connelly and even Marlon Wayans (a surprising casting choice) all give the performances of their careers, which emphasise their talent to perform in extremely challenging, sadomasochistic roles.It is a fact that the film takes too long to achieve saying what it wants to say, as the first 30 minutes pontificates, rather than giving the viewer anything to contemplate. Plus, there are some ludicrous moments, such as the mailing scene with the old ladies, which feels highly inappropriate. Nonetheless, along with Trainspotting (which is irrefutably superior) Requiem for a Dream is one of the best anti-drugs films to be released in modern cinema. It is amazing to think that the first 'drugs film' was the exaggeratedly peculiar Reefer Madness from 1936, which is now considered hysterically stupid. How times have changed, along with cinema because it is quite apparent that Requiem for a Dream is, and never will be, a laughing matter.",5,2,4,2 June 2007
Se7en," 'Se7en' Takes The Viewer Inside A World Relentlessly Threatened By Danger. An Indisputable Example Of A Modern Masterpiece
","Back in '95 David Fincher released a film named Se7en, following his cruelly underrated '93 box-office-disaster Alien3 (view the director's cut and you might understand what I mean). In the sense of the American film industry, Se7en was the film which established Fincher's talent and from there on in he had more freedom on the films he wanted to create.Se7en is a dark tale of morality, depicting two cops who both find themselves stuck inside a deadly game. One of the cops is Sommerset (Morgan Freeman), a man planning to retire from the job and the environment of which he deems unfit and too bleak to live in, a place where he believes 'apathy' is welcomed. The other cop, Mills (Brad Pitt) has recently required his detective badge and has moved to the city of Chicago to help bring 'light' to the city, while building a 'hero' reputation. Both detectives have different views on the squalid world they are surrounded by and both use different methods when performing a task. The detectives soon find themselves obsessed with capturing a vicious criminal who is terrifying the area with bizarre 'deadly sins' killings and leaving puzzling and mostly unusable evidence at the scene of the crimes.The narrative which Se7en follows is one that is structured with such precision that you become apart of the film. The viewer becomes grasped by the story's compelling nature and the manipulative unanswered questions. Yet, here lies one of the few faults with Se7en, this being the film's tendency to lose the connectivity of scenes. At times this can detract the viewer, while also making subplots feel cut-off and halted abruptly. Although, this is not too significantly noticeable, it is still there and something which stops the film deserving a definitive 'masterpiece' status.The film still surges with its constant excitement and attention to detail, making it a film of such finesse that it remarkably works as a delicate counter-piece to the horrific story being told. I consider the pivotal scene in Se7en to be the chase scene, the scene whereby the viewer captures their first glimpse of John Doe (with the exclusion of the infamous opening-credits). It is a scene where my adrenaline started pumping, a scene so expertly thought out with such visceral realism, taking the characters to their most primitive of instincts. This is where the set-pieces come in; the set-pieces in Se7en are built with glaring authenticity and unsettling detail, retaining the disturbing exuberance the film follows.Se7en is a film that goes leaps and bounds for the modern 'cops vs. criminals' genre; it provides a level of rarely matched excitement and adrenaline-pumping emotion. It is a film so genuine that by the end of the film you will have built up a bond with the two protagonists. It is remarkable just how exact and precise the film is in its style, atmospherically edited (with the exception of the connectivity) and wonderfully layered offering much analysis for the viewer. One of the film's optimum features are the multi-dimensional characters, the characters of Se7en are ones who you care for and are characters who have robust personality to study. It is impossible not to adore the film's appetite for its characters, such as the clashing viewpoints, offering the viewer to make their own personal judgement and also the character's reactions to the repulsive behaviour which has engulfed the city. All this is due to how astonishingly rigorous and convincing the performances are, the actors all develop their own persona and you have to take note of the smaller details to gain a true understanding of the characters.Se7en is a film providing sour, surfaced-toned noir to enable the merging of absorbing grittiness and 'lucid' fantasy, etched with painful realism. The film details every dark corner, capturing a feel of vulnerability and the general taste of fear through highly alluring, yet horribly detached environments, ultimately providing a cold and painfully evocative atmosphere. The cinematography is rigorous, while still being very open in its wonderfully 'edgy' style. The camera is fixated on the tiniest detail, capturing the emotion on the lens through the exposed characters in wide, yet horribly tight environments. The make-up is just another example of the laborious amount of time and pre-development which was spent on creating the film's 'gothic fairytale' manner. Even with all the technical brilliance, it is still the acting which remains the film's finest feature.More importantly than anything Se7en remains one of the finest films in its genre, providing a relief from your typically simplistic Hollywood film. Instead the film offers a depressing morality tale which motivates the viewer into thinking about what will occur next and giving you taste of the horrific crimes detectives become obsessed with solving. Ultimately, few films can succeed in gripping you as much as the inexplicable brilliance of Se7en.",8,0,0,12 April 2007
The Big Lebowski," Allegory For My Life
","Overtly based on Raymond Chandler's classic novel 'The Big Sleep', The Big Lebowski is my favourite work from the Coen Brothers, along with Miller's Crossing. When released in 1998 cinema-goers were baffled by the film, with most viewers not being able to even gather an opinion. However, once the film was available for purchase a cult following began to emerge, which has given birth to the annual Lebowski Fest and a so-called religion named 'Dudeism.' The world of Lebowski has become an element of modern pop-culture, while Jeff Bridge's character 'The Dude' has developed into an icon of apathy. His days are spent bowling, drinking, experiencing occasional acid flashbacks and delving in pacifism.Conducting an exhaustingly (and intentionally) complex tale of a trophy wife's kidnapping, The Big Lebowski puts fourth a crime story as a means of making everything about the picture even more ludicrous than its characters. You see, the Coen Brothers routinely craft films concerning characters that have become swathed in absurdist situations. This is an ulterior motive; a means of clashing wacky diversities with an impelling sense of convolution. The Big Lebowski is about characters that are blissfully unaware of the complications which arouse due to their erratic behaviour. Jeff Bridge's protagonist The Dude (a.k.a. Jeffrey Lebowski) becomes apart of a kidnapping plot by accident. He unwittingly stumbles across the scheme after a contextual naming error, in which two house-breaking thugs urinate on his rug. In response The Dude seeks compensation from the intended victim who happens to carry the same name, hence the confusion. As you can see, I am rambling and could do with a 'Caucasian' cocktail.The Big Lebowski has been apart of my life for many years now; I recall lapping up the dialogue to such an extent that I would unintentionally quote the film during everyday conversations and I still do. This boils down to a screenplay which will retain its status as one of the finest ever written. By no means is the script artificial or plagiarised, instead the breathtaking originality of it came as a breath of fresh air to the QT-laden dialogue which circulated throughout the independent cinema of the '90s. Exemplifying imagination and entertainment is the aim of The Big Lebowski; dumb, half-witted nonsense is not what the film illustrates, as some people have wrongly accused it of being. Oh, and I must not disregard a clear and present fact; Jeff Bridges offers one of the greatest performances of all-time.Do not dismiss this masterpiece as a senseless twaddle, as that would be an unfair accusation for such a multi-layered outing in confrontational, elaborate humour. This is comedy as an art form, and so is conducted on an ambitious scale of subtly intelligent, foul-mouthed wit. Except this is a farce crafted on a mesmerising scale of ingenuity and radiating charm. Characters like Walter Sobchak, Donny Kerabatsos, Jesus Quintana and of course the German nihilists are irrefutable creations of hypocritical hilarity. Throughout the picture The Dude encounters a vast array of sarcastically written characters, which are effectively caricatures of combined personalities. Stylistically, the film is crammed to the brim with stunning film-making procedures (e.g. the Jackie Treehorn section) which accentuate the confrontational wackiness of what could be hailed as a 'warped homage to film-noir.' For a film of the '90s, the soundtrack is punctuated with retro rock & roll from forgotten eras and in essence identifies a 'hippy' stance.It might be worth noting that this review is just my opinion, man. Even so, that should not stop you from viewing a film which is destined to be regarded as something not just of the '90s, but of today's culture, too. Remember: abide by The Dude's -rational, whether you like it or not- philosophies. Simply take each day as it comes and try not to live in the past, stranger.",10,1,2,16 October 2007
Fight Club," A Social-Commentary For The New Era
","Addressing the ploys of consumerism and materialism, Fight Club created a distinct manifesto of liberation during the last few months of the '90s. Its impact is yet to of worn off and with each passing year the imperative social-commentary becomes more popular. At its time of release, Fight Club was widely misunderstood, due to the 'graphic' depiction of nihilism which is expressed through the film and was hailed by some as misogynistic. Although it did not receive much attention around the time of release, the rise in DVD sales helped to propel popularity and eventually resulted in Fight Club becoming a cult picture.In 1996, Chuck Palahniuk wrote Fight Club, a novel which held the inevitability of an adaptation. It was only three years later before Fight Club was released as a motion-picture. Twentieth Century Fox acknowledged that the film was going to hold a mass appeal and garner a much deserved following of fans who could relate to the picture's satirical take on the woes of modern life. Emerging talent David Fincher was chosen to direct the adaptation (though remaining hesitant because of his experience with Fox on Alien³), while Jim Uhls wrote the screenplay. Edward Norton was chosen to star as the film's protagonist and Brad Pitt (who Fincher had previously worked with on Se7en) was cast in the key supporting role. It was from here that David Fincher gave birth to his undisputed masterpiece.Telling the tale of a nameless, thirty-something office-worker (often referred to as The Narrator and performed by Edward Norton) who has lost all motivation and self-respect, the picture chronicles his journey through enlightenment. Starting off as a spectator and consumerist, The Narrator's venture begins with his sudden addiction to anonymous self-help groups. It is from the testicular cancer and alcoholics anonymous groups that he gains pity, and because of being an unexposed faker can wallow in the sympathy he has craved for. On a business trip, The Narrator encounters Tyler Durden, a soap-salesman who he chooses to befriend. The two friends soon assemble a fight club, where men endure bare-knuckled, underground fighting. Essentially, the group (which becomes a guerrilla organisation) is a metaphor for 'feeling alive' and allows men to feel the utmost level of masculinity.Fight Club does not promote violence, deprivation, anarchy, communism or even mischief; it merely works as a representation for turning a mundane, forlorn lifestyle into a way of venting out primitive frustration. The numbed office drones depicted in the film realise that their lives are meaningless and are prepared to go through pain to receive clarification that they still exist both mentally and physically. Fighting is an embodiment of man's most archaic and rebellious instincts. Man's aspiration for chaos is symbolised through Project Mayhem, (the mischief group, built upon members of the fight club) and the disdain aimed towards materialism is etched inside the personality traits of Tyler Durden. Laden with justifiable transgression, the film portrays its hatred of consumerism through subtle character interactions, repressed emotion and glaring visuals (e.g. Ikea, Starbucks, Soap), which are often an amusing arguably contradictory- disparity of beliefs. There are a number of themes below the surface of the picture (such as homosexuality) which should be taken into consideration when in search of understanding.Filmed in damp, dirty lighting and mixed with 'ultra-cool' editing, viewers will find it difficult to resist the overwhelming generosity of aesthetically pleasing film-making. The satirical temperament of the picture is empathised by the characteristics of the film's subtext. Fight Club is thoughtful, exhilarating and amusing, so the absurd visual stance is best suited for a film of its genre. Characters will often break the 'fourth wall', letting viewers relate to the ideas more freely. Welcomingly peculiar visuals are an extra ingredient for keeping the viewer instantly immersed. Since the film contains such robust characters, it is hard to deny the charm of the narrative style. When you have each performer delivering witty, anti-conformist sentences then it is impossible to become detracted or disconcerted. In fact, the three main protagonists are some of the finest ever written. Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter provide what are three of my favourite performances from the '90s, which should be rank among the most exciting and versatile.Sadly, it is within the second act that the picture misdirects its testosterone. Of course, none of the entertainment value is lost. Instead, the nature of the film suddenly becomes a plunge into non-stop anti-capitalism, which in my opinion becomes overused to a slight extent. Fortunately, this does not linger and the narrative turns back to being the journey of self-discovery it started out as. Nothing can stop Fight Club from being a film I love to watch. Its vigorously entertaining ambiance provokes exhilaration and reflection that few films can match. The notions and philosophies of such a statement may be too testing for a number of viewers to grasp; nevertheless, the stinging candour and acrimony should not be ignored.",9,1,3,30 September 2007
Memento," Cryptic Storytelling That Somehow Works
","Little known director Christopher Nolan almost instantaneously claimed his place as one of modern cinema's most innovative directors when he released Memento to almost unanimous recognition. It caught the attention of many critics and filmmakers alike, establishing itself as something in the realms of 'cinematic literature.' It was a work that marked the appeal of new-wave noir, more commonly known as neo-noir. Not only this, but its alternate take on nonlinear narrative storytelling was a breath of fresh-air to the overuse of non-linear concepts that had aroused during the 1990s.Starring Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, Memento tells the story of Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce), a man suffering from short-term memory loss following the murder of his wife. Following his wife's tragic death, Leonard begins seeking revenge on whoever murdered his wife, slowly piecing together clues with the help of a mysterious 'detective' figure, named Teddy (Joe Pantoliano). Due to the memory condition he suffers from, Leonard has great difficulty collecting information and relies on tattoos and constant note taking to record his findings. Soon after, another questionable character is introduced, this being Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss), and like with Teddy her origins are practically unknown. A web of ambiguity and distrust soon entangles Leonard, never knowing if either Teddy or Natalie are genuine.The narrative carefully revolves around these three central characters, playing out incidents in seemingly alternate realities and reverse chronology. It is the editing that enables the viewer to experience a similar sensation as Leonard, by essentially jumbling scenes, splicing colour footage of his investigation alongside black and white moments where Leonard is discussing an insurance case of a man who also claimed to suffer from short-term memory loss. It is these moments specifically, which reveal the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of Leonard, essentially painting the man's past. Memento cannot be classed as a mystery, such a term sounds far too throwaway; rather, it is more a vengeance/chase flick, but even placing it in such a category seems somewhat derogatory.As noir goes, Memento does incorporate many of the distinctive elements; including voice-over, noticeable use of shadow, nihilistic themes and low-key lighting. The characters are very noir, as each one has a certain shady quality to their personality and hints at having ulterior motives. It is these things that make the film so thrilling, even on any revisit. Still, there are a few gripes I have, such as the reverse narrative being somewhat of a gimmicky disguise for a simple plot. Additionally, the plot becomes almost too convoluted at times, with a sense of repetition resulting in moments of complete perplexity. Then again, the perplexity is arguably a great feature for it allows the viewer becomes increasingly more agitated, and almost begs for your concentration.The multiple narrative techniques used in Memento allow the intrigue to expand as the story progresses, and in a relentless manner that does not eschew till the climatic moments. As films about memory go, this is definitely one of the best depictions of memory trauma and obsession in recent years. It pulls all the necessary gears that craft an absorbing cinematic venture, and not only that but it explores the psyche of a man whose perception of reality has been completely disfigured. Combining the thoughts and actions through a voice-over and reverse narrative is an exceptionally difficult thing to conquer through writing; therefore the screenplay deserves much credit. In fact, the story was adapted from a novella by Christopher Nolan's brother Jonathan, entitled Memento Mori that was essentially an essay on memory and the individual's perception of reality.An important element of Memento is the idea of recollection and how we often subconsciously chose the way we recollect one moment from the next. During the film, there is a scene where Leonard expresses how humans cannot rely on memory. In addition, paradoxes such as the notion of Leonard not remembering to forget his wife are in effect an example of what would cure his grief. Performance wise, the film is pretty much incredible, with the exception of some moments of sketchy wit uttered by the actors. It is Guy Pearce who steals the show though, proving that he can hold a film together, in what is his best performance since 1997's L.A. Confidential. As a viewer, I could feel great empathy for his character, acknowledging the difficulties associated with memory loss and the way in which one conceals memories through tragedy. This is a contemporary work not to be missed and remains the most important role of Nolan's ever growing career. In my opinion, he has come close to surpassing the film with his excellent takes on the Batman saga, but that is a different story entirely.",8,0,2,9 October 2008
Oldboy," One Of The Most Original And Compelling Films Ever Made. 'Oldboy' Blew Me Away
","I personally feel Oldboy is the best film to come out of Asian cinema, it really hit me hard. I loved it from start to finish, this dark tale of revenge is one of the most unique experiences I've ever had. Everything about Oldboy is perfect, the direction, the poetic screenplay, the haunting operatic score and the wonderful acting. Even though Oldboy is a tale of revenge, it has an underlying message of redemption.I mean how can you feel sorry for someone when you don't know what they have done. You see Oldboy questions the viewer, you will falter between feeling sorry for someone and then wondering 'But what did they do to make that person do such a thing?' The film tests what many viewers can handle, even though the film is disturbing it adds a touch of twisted humour. Chan-wook Park is a director with a lot of talent, he mixes genres perfectly and many different techniques used to create a dark foreboding atmosphere.The dialogue is poetic, deep and meaningful. The phrase 'Laugh, and the world laughs with you, weep, and you weep alone' is a very true statement. It's the kind of dialogue where you want to sit back and think about it for a second because everything moves with great pacing. The movie is deep and fulfilling. It holds many surprise twists and turns and uses some great shock techniques.The film mixes genres together, mainly using revenge and drama. The movie studies humanity and how a person can hurt someone without realising it. I would say this masterpiece is very psychological because it tests the viewers boundaries of what they can handle in certain places. The movie has a very comic book feel to it because it's based of a Manga series as well as being part of the 'Vengance Trilogy'. The movie helps define the often used term of 'cool'.Oldboy stands high up in a class of it's own, the movie is visual beauty and shows the pain that the characters are going through. The edging menace that weaves it's way throughout the film manages to keep the viewer watching and grasping for more. Oldboy is a film that sticks with you and plays on your mind for a long time after each viewing. The movie is very deep and manages to show things through 'In your face' technique and subtle imagery through acting. Another genius aspect would be the way you can't really decide who's the bad person is, there are definitely no good characters apart from Dae-su Oh's lover who acts powerfully and with lots of precision.For example one of the great scenes in this masterpiece is the love scene, it shows all the pain Dae-su Oh is going through. The actor Min-sik Choi has been casted perfectly and plays his role as Dae-su Oh with sublime brilliance. The direction is stylish and different, the movie experiments with very clever camera techniques. An example would be the close up of Dae-su Oh in the right hand corner of the screen and the blurred image of someone behind him. Oldboy is an extremely intelligent style of film making that is for a viewer who wants to get something out of the movie they are watching.The movie is somewhat like a Film-Noir, the narration adds depth and powerhouse style to the films undertone. Hence the idea of revenge and telling the tale of something that asks the viewer questions. The movie plays with the mind and twists everything you once thought was correct. The viewer never knows who to trust or what is going to happen next. he movie is unpredictable and feels like a poem of death. The first 40 minutes or so build up a claustrophobic atmosphere. The film shows how our society and class we live in is fuelled by evil.The movie is far from being at action movie and some might say far from being a revenge movie. It's more about lost love, self indulgence and finding inner tranquillity. The acting as mentioned is very powerful and provokes the viewer to ask the one main question that the film offers and that's 'Why?' Another important aspect would be 'Insanity' and 'What drives a human? What really makes them want to go out and do something?' Some viewers will be put off from the films high-octane style and grace. But mainly the fact the movie is very twisted and disturbing. Though the added touch of satire adds a crazed ambition. The film actually feels quite Quentin Tarantino like in certain places or at least something that would appeal to his taste in film. The film is unflinching with it's camera use and what is being put fourth in front of the viewer.Perfection, detail and sublime visual flare makes this one of the greatest films ever made. You'll be wanting to see Oldboy again and again as soon as it finishes. The movie is confusing and fulfilling with it's wonderfully sweeping plot line. There is no doubt about it, Oldboy is one of the greatest films of the 21st century.",9,33,110,9 July 2006
Superbad," Seth Rogen Has Successfully Placed His Signature On American Comedy History
","I was always anticipating Superbad, but I never expected anything near to the quality of film-making and cinema experience I received. Coming out of the cinema with a huge grin on my face made me realise that a 'teen flick' can be a winner, something which seemed impossible. Technically speaking, it is almost impossible to create an even decent 'teen flick', given that to class Superbad as such a thing would be dismissive. For example, the '90s classic Dazed and Confused is often classed as a teen movie, but it is much more than that, considering the film studies the social-trends of a forgotten era which gave birth to modern teen culture. It is nostalgic viewing for many, just like what Superbad will grow to be in the years to come.Seth Rogen has been having a victorious time throughout 2007; kicking off the summer with Knocked Up and ending with Superbad, he is establishing himself as one of the finest actors and script writers working within modern comedy. Deservedly, this is something the talented comedian has been working for, and now maintains a place within comedic history. Seth Rogen wrote and starred in Superbad, and on viewing the picture you will observe his talent as both a writer and actor.Superbad does not exactly carry a narrative structure, something best suited for a film of its kind and so should not be used as a criticism. Essentially, the film follows the day of three high-school friends who have been invited to a party on account of them providing the alcohol. It is that simple on the surface, but the film turns out to be significantly more intelligent than just teens looking to score and get wasted. Not only does the picture place some moralistic ideas into the dialogue, but it speaks to its audience with an easy-to-relate-to style.If you ever did or are experiencing the high-school lifestyle then Superbad will be an instantly recognisable achievement. The film is crammed with themes which the viewer can relate to and sums up the series of gauche events encountered throughout adolescence. Filmed in garish colours and through exaggerated techniques, Superbad epitomises retro cool and certainly does not value discretion. Everything works perfectly against the outlandishly preoccupied sex jokes. Written with a bravura tone of angst and rebellion, the nerdy comedy fuses with the energetic and welcoming characters. The screenplay is crafted on a torrent of clever hilarities, which progressively become slightly more subtle (if that is even possible for Superbad) as the film develops. Moving at a consistently fast pace, the film refuses to let the viewer have room breathe; it is at these moments that the viewer will most likely realise the timing of the film. And although these moments are a sign of thin wearing, the picture manages to pick its momentum up again, due to the rapid-fire and constant barrage of jokes.The film is going to undoubtedly propel the careers of the three protagonist actors. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera have become relatively well-known over the last couple of years for their work within American comedy. Nonetheless, it is supporting performer Christopher Mintz-Plasse (in his debut role) who outshines the rest of the cast. The casting of him as Fogell a.k.a. McLovin is too good to be true, as he personifies the character entirely and crafts a role which will forever be quoted and loved. Seth Rogen and Bill Hader also star as the two off-beat, lazy cops; the pair work together with an amusing ease, proving that the chemistry depicted is not forced but completely natural. In fact, this goes without saying because the whole cast combine flawlessly.Overflowing with memorable scenes (which should not be spoiled) and relentless entertainment Superbad continues to be a riot long after the credits have rolled. Superbad is something truly spectacular and was an intrepid business risk worth employing. Its success is overwhelming, but once seen it is easily understandable.",7,1,5,25 September 2007
Brokeback Mountain," Set To Be An American Classic, 'Brokeback Mountain' Strides Alongside The Great Tales Of Unrequited Love
","Opening to mass public scrutiny and critical acclaim, Brokeback Mountain is easily one of the most controversial American films in recent years. The fuss surrounding the production and eventual release was baffling, with religious groups campaigning for boycotts and cinemas even threatening to not screen the film. Such notoriety backfired, sparking worldwide attention and leading to a surprisingly large box-office reception. In retrospect, the controversy was baffling; it was not as though it was the first mainstream feature to have a narrative based around a homosexual romance. What 'appalled' the conservative and religious sectors was that the John Wayne, rugged and raw cowboy image had been shattered. Nevertheless, a western setting does not make a western.Emerging two years after his Hulk misfire, Ang Lee was determined to return to his directional roots, while experimenting with a story more challenging than anything else he had attempted before. Upon completion, Lee entered his finished product into the Venice Film Festival line-up, and eventually earned himself the prestigious Golden Lion award. Then the Oscars arrived, where the film earned Lee a Best Director award, along with Best Original Score and Best Adapted Screenplay. The film, adapted from a short story by Annie Proulx, revolves around two down n' out, drifting cowboys who fall in love while ranching cattle together. From then on in the two men secretly maintain their thwarted relationship, visiting each other while both remaining married with children.Performances are the key ingredient to Brokeback Mountain's overwhelming emotional power. The most notable roles are responsible to the two lead male performances by Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal. Both actors prove to be above and beyond the generic acting standards found in mainstream cinema. Respectably, it is Ledger's performance which is to be cherished; the gentle humanity he brings to his rough and troubled character of Ennis Del Mar is beautifully conceived. The feelings of guilt, the troubled expressions and idiosyncrasies are beautifully mastered by Ledger, showing his ability to capture a man struggling to accept his inner desire to escape with the man he so loves. It is bound to leave a profound impression of imprisonment, and almost any viewer will respond with empathy.Further developing his directional craft, Ang Lee succeeds in establishing himself as one of today's most important and resourceful directors. After the success of grand period-pieces, such as Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and Sense and Sensibility you would not have expected trashy flops like The Hulk. Fortunately, Lee ended up producing a fine counter-piece to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and also evolving his reoccurring theme of characters coping with suppressed emotion in the confines of a judgemental society. What I admire most is Lee's ability to demonstrate the utmost respect for each character, especially valuing the perceptive nature of his camera. His attention to detail is tender and cordial, displaying a much needed humanity rarely found in today's pictures. On the contrary, there are specific moments of episodic allegory which tests the viewer's interpretive skills. Such a device also increases the intimacy and speaks for the questioning turmoil of the characters.With its gorgeous score, striking location footage and motivated acting, Brokeback Mountain does everything a masterpiece should. It is films like Brokeback Mountain that have the capability to make individual members of society become more aware and accepting of homosexuality. Yet, more than anything else it proves that love is an uncontrollable force, whilst holding testament to the beauty of cinema and its ability to captivate the viewer like no other medium.",9,14,15,8 May 2008
Ed Wood," Charms Through Its Whim and Wisdom. Never Has A Bad Director Been Smothered In Such Respect
","Renowned for crafting incredibly bad films and often cited as the 'worst director ever', Edward D. Wood Jr. has become a cult icon inside the world of film. Although his films are entirely detestable, they are rarely a chore to watch because of the comedic value which is on offer. It could be argued that he was the man who gave birth to 'Z movie horror.' It is widely acknowledged that Tim Burton has long been an admirer of classic horror films, which resulted in his reoccurring use of German expressionism (mise-en-scène) and Gothic themes in his own works. Similar to many of Tim Burton's films, Ed Wood is about a bizarre, eccentric and unique man.Chronicling a man's rise to 'personal success' and his overwhelming desire to become the next Orson Welles, Ed Wood charts the director's fascinatingly manic career; from Glen or Glenda, to Plan 9 from Outer Space. Both are two of the most shamefully undesirable disasters 'Hollywood' has ever produced, but to Ed Wood they were gold. Even so, he was a man who had the utmost level of zest for his so-called 'art' and would never back-down to the barrage of criticism he would constantly receive. To Ed Wood, Glen or Glenda was a highly personal film, which was supposed to tell the world his desire to wear women's clothes, instead it made him look entirely foolish. This pretty much defines the career of the 'world's worst director.' Strangely enough, Ed Wood is not a biopic which bashes the man, or makes fun out of him. Instead, Tim Burton creates a loving homage to the quintessential master of the 'Z movie.' Upon finishing a Tim Burton film it is irregular not to undergo satisfaction, but with Ed Wood it is impossible. Evidently, (or at least I believe so) it is Burton's most triumphant work to-date, yet oddly enough, receives underwhelming acclaim. It is a shame that viewers of today are prepared to spend money to see terrible odes like Mars Attacks (a disastrous experiment by Burton) and then turn down the opportunity to experience a genuine homage, such as Ed Wood. The lovable, informative and often amusing take on the life of a cinematic failure ranks among the greatest films from the '90s.Delivering staggering vigour and once again proving his versatility, Johnny Depp took centre-stage for his finest collaboration with mentor-like Burton. And to think that it was not until 2003's Pirates of the Caribbean was released that Depp received his first academy award nomination. Robbery, considering his performance was undoubtedly the best of its year (1994). How many male actors are prepared to accept almost any role, do anything for it (e.g. prance around in drag) and actually achieve the utmost level of professionalism? Luckily and ironically, actor Marin Landau received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor (awarded for his role as the drug-addicted and deadbeat Dracula star, Bella Lugosi). These are performances of aching personality, and are drenched with amusing anecdotes.Filmed in black-and-white, Ed Wood crafts a precise image of the 1950s Hollywood scene. Not only does it signify poignancy, but it also swells with nostalgia. Camera movements are both graceful and erratic, suited as allegory for Mr. Wood's own unpredictability. Surely this is a personal work, something which can be noted through the tactfully comic screenplay. With the exception of factual (although not fatal by any means) inaccuracies, the picture remains a victorious achievement and should be hailed for its comic brilliance more regularly, if you ask me. As a director (and on a side note), Tim Burton should be applauded for his ability to pay sympathy and respect for a man who was painfully oblivious of his exceptional ineptness. It would have been arrogant to have shown blatant pity for Edward D. Wood Jr., so as a director he remains subtle when underlying his sympathy (and even understanding) of a futile longing for excellence.",9,1,1,29 October 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," Simply Majestical Even In The Darkest Of Times; Pan's Labyrinth Is The Film Of 2006. The Finest and Most Inventive Fantasy Since, Say 'Lord of the Rings'
","With all the anticipation I had leading up to Guillermo del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth I was not remotely disappointed with the final outcome. Usually when I find myself anticipating a film I may be disappointed or unimpressed with what was on offer, yet Pan's Labyrinth has everything you could ever want a Gothic fairy tale to have. At first glance a lot of people thought that Pan's Labyrinth was a children's film that looked like something that resembled Alice In Wonderland. Firstly people could not be more wrong, Pan's Labyrinth is a gruelling, disturbing, emotional and brutal journey of light and dark. And secondly even though the film has lose elements of Alice In Wonderland, it's still very different; plus the fact Alice In Wonderland was never a book intended for children anyway.Guillermo del Toro has been slowly becoming a big name among big-name non-American directors. His first film Cronos was an early 90s film that had some small success, but somewhat unnoticed by critics. He then manages to get a deal for a more mainstream American horror film named Mimic. From there the rest is history with the likes of the chilling The Devil's Backbone, the underrated vampire flick Blade II and then the big money superhero film Hellboy. Pan's Labyrinth is with no doubt his best film to date and remains a modern benchmark in artistic, unadulterated fantasy.Pan's Labyrinth is the tale of a young girl (Ofelia) who during WWII goes with her pregnant mother to a small army base in deep in the mountain forests of Spain to live with her adoptive father during the pregnancy. The Spanish fascist army are fighting off the rebels who want peace for the country and though the film does not follow historical accuracies as this is intended for the tale of fantasy and reality. Ofelia is not very fond of her adoptive father as her birth father died when she was younger. Ofelia can see that her adoptive father is a truly evil, arrogant and malevolent man so tries her best to keep away from him. One day she a Faun (you'll become suspicious of his presence) meets her, telling her she is a lost princess of an ancient world and says that she'll be able to return is she completes 3 tasksOfelia is a truly brilliant character and from the moment you are introduced to her you will realise that she already locked inside her own fantasy world as shown from her looking preoccupied, distant and the fact she has a stack of fairy-tale books. Her mother exclaims 'aren't you too old for fairy-tales?' and the girl vaguely replies with a vacant expression showing her obsolete distance. When watching Pan's Labyrinth I felt that it was a very personal tale for Guillermo del Toro as it contained some very individual elements and structure. I felt there was a sort of religious subtext to the film and mystical/mythical symbolism to represent this.The film's ambiance is one that feels dank, murky, melancholy and eerie. There is a lot of symbolism and metaphors to the fact that the mill is a dark and threatening place where violence looms over the inhabitants like a virus. This represents the general evil that lies in the area and there is not often a lot of light in the film and when there is it's subtler. One evident use of light to show 'hope' is when Ofelia is around her mother (this is only evident at rare aspects in time). Scenes of fantasy-like states of mind and the stark reality generally occupy the film. Something that stands out is the fact that there is so much beauty to be found is such bleak imagery. This all helps to create a remarkable work of art.Pan's Labyrinth shows what is the best cinematography of the last few years and every shot feels like it's been pondered to the point of perfection. The inner-beauty even in some of the more disturbing scenes is there for you to watch. The uses of light pouring on a man's tortured face and the ingenious creatures, they're almost too weird for comfort. The film's use of heavy rain running through the trees is excellent and each shot captures the sorrowful expressions fantastically. The film also detains a certain amount of hope in even the darkest times; childhood innocence is another implication that the film holds.While the film will make you sit back in admiration at its deep-rooted Gothic design you'll still be attracted to all the other fine details. For example the remarkable score accompanies scenes perfectly and vividly creates brilliant tones of ambiguity. Guillermo del Toro intensely creates astonishingly grotesque characters (both human and beast) because of handcrafted imagination that has poured into the work. One of the finest elements is in fact the the editing is so precise and unique.An outstanding work of modern cinema that I'm almost positive will be regarded as a classic in years to come. Harsh, disturbing, bleak, pitiless, cruel and yet it still has a heart. It won't be forgotten as it's packed with thoughtfulness and imagery that will be lodged in your mind for the rest of your life. The best film of 2006 and one that is bound to suspend you in awe from start to finish.",9,3,6,4 December 2006
Taxi Driver," Films Are Rarely As Powerful In Depicting A Tortured and Lonely Soul
","In the early '70s, Martin Scorsese was a young director who was slowly emerging as a talent for being one of the finest directors in cinema. In 1976 Taxi Driver was released and provoked fierce controversy across the US, as well as a stunning amount critical acclaim, some naming it, 'a landmark film of the 70s'. Over the years it gained reputation for many things, the most obvious being the hugely iconic 'you talking' to me?' and De Niro's epic performance of the lonely, Travis Bickle.Taxi Driver follows the story of taxi driver, Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro). A Vietnam veteran, struggling to accept the harsh, sleazy reality of New York slowly drifts away from reality and becomes obsessed with the idea of 'wiping the scum from the city'. It's a story that is structured with elegance and a slow ease. The script is memorable and flawless in its delivery, deserving the iconic status.When I first watched Taxi Driver I was not sure what to make of it, I certainly felt it was a tour de force work, littered with excellence. Yet, I always felt something was missing and that I was one of a handful of people who felt it was nothing more than a 'good film'. Over the years I have re-watched Taxi Driver and it has slowly grown on me. On my fourth viewing it finally hit me that Taxi Driver is a masterpiece. Something caught me, full-on and I felt so naïve to have not realised it sooner. I've always considered Scorsese to be one of the greatest visionaries in cinema, I've always loved his films and yet, Taxi Driver was his only film that took me time to truly acknowledge.Few films are as deep and offer so many re-watches with what is such a lurid, downbeat and disturbing subject matter. It's not easy viewing, yet it's a film that you'll be able and more importantly want to watch countless times. Few dramas are as fascinating and striking in visual style as Taxi Driver. The ability to engross you inside the mind of a mad-man and make you become the passenger in the taxi is astounding. You become apart of Travis' journey, a man plagued by insanity and yet one who holds frighteningly similar views of the revolting aspects of society. Except Travis is a man who takes it to the extreme because of the fact he has become traumatised by society and through society's transformation over the Vietnam period.Robert De Niro is the greatest actor to ever grace cinema, he also holds the greatest performance in cinema for Raging Bull and in Taxi Driver he gives another one of his other mesmerising performances. Travis Bickle is different to many of the other characters De Niro has wonderfully portrayed other the years and prove his dynamic versatility as an actor. He pulls off his performances with ease and that's because he steps inside the shoes of his character. We slowly watch Travis Bickle's charisma change as the film progresses, we note the difference in his reactions to a situation and we also observe his manners and the differences in how he treats himself after having his rage bottled up. It's a performance that has the important depth which is a key part to the film; Taxi Driver is about as captivating as a character study gets. The amazing cast; including, Jodie Foster, Cybill Shepherd and Harvey Keitel give career highlighting performances, perfecting their on-screen skills.Taxi Driver has a lot to say about the life we live in, giving us a portrait of some of the darkest elements of humanity. It's a film that bursts with its individual flare of film-making. The editing is sharp, clean-cut and filled with some beautifully haunting slow-motion footage. It's plagued by De Niro's poignant narration that echoes noir undertones and political insight. The cinematography is also astonishing in the way it captures the urban jungle of gritty culture. Then you have those magnificent metaphors; for example, the rain on the car windscreen to represent the washing away of guilty sins and the bubbling water to show the boiling up of suppressed anger. You've also got the tender score, mixed with a sleazy jazz ambiance which perfectly accompanies the experience. Martin Scorsese stamps his trademark of film-making style, making it impossible for another artist to plagiarise his work.There are no doubts that Taxi Driver offers the viewer many questions and ones to study till your heart's content knowing that your perception of a film like Taxi Driver can always change. For me it's evident that Taxi Driver remains Scorsese's most difficult work for a viewer and also one of his most perfected. It's a pure and simple fact that Taxi Driver is without hesitation a true cinematic masterpiece. Few films even come close to the indisputable power and fulfilment of Taxi Driver. One of the few films that becomes a greater experience every time, it's a personal and essential experience of film art.",10,0,1,16 January 2007
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick Puts Fourth The Regretful Journey Of One Man's Life Majestically, Epically and Dramatically Through Celluloid
","Stanley Kubrick for many is considered the finest director to of ever graced the earth. Famous for managing to capture so much detail in one frame of delight, even in the darkest and deadliest moments of his films he retains a naturally deliberate comedic affect. I've always been a great fan of 'Kubrick cinema' as he's managed to tell devastatingly bleak tales of life and death with such ease and rhythm. Fact is Kubrick knows how you should tell a story through film.Barry Lyndon is a film that has an extensive range on offer to its viewers and with grand visual openness. From the narrative opening showing a fire-armed duel, in a gloomy Irish setting and a long-haul shot of the two men standing across from one-an-other, you automatically know you in for a cinematic treat. The film follows the Irish rouge Barry Lyndon's life; he's not from a wealthy background and strives to become a wealthy British aristocrat during the annoyances of the 18th century Seven Year European War.Barry Lyndon stands out as a true cinematic delight, a masterpiece if you will and a genuine epic classic that has stood the test of time and remains one of the best films ever made. Barry Lyndon came out in the pinnacle of the 70s and managed to receive many awards and praise from critics. I've always adored Barry Lyndon, but it wasn't until a repeat viewing that I finally decided it's my favourite film. Some have called Barry Lyndon 'repetitive' or as 'flawed beauty', I see those as foolish opinions because to appreciate the film you have to be able to understand it by looking deeper than what's obvious to the viewer. The film is not remotely 'dull' or 'repetitive' because it's a film that grasps you throughout the stretch and pulls you into one man's compelling quest through life.Barry Lyndon has become somewhat of an uncommonly mentioned film that has been forgotten by many and yet remains loved and hailed by others. It's a story that is structured precisely to the minute details and adapted with outstanding delicate appreciation to William Makepeace Thackeray novel.Like most Kubrick films it has subtle humorous undertones and devastating moments of dramatic parallels help make the film have the glorious variety throughout the three hour running time. The story is structured so delicately that there is not a single moment where you're not enthralled or captivated from one of the film's examples of overwhelming excellence. The pacing never falters, nor does it lose any of the originality it holds. There's so much on offer in one frame that you'll want to replay a single still-shot over and over.Kubrick is a perfectionist and he's famous for having that personality trait, his arrogant and compulsive attitudes have managed to bring some of his actors to the verge of breakdown. Werner Herzog is another artistic genius who has some insane traits surrounding his work, but don't they say 'even the greatest artists are a little mad'.The cinematography is some of the most luxurious your eyes will ever have the absolute pleasure of meeting. Even in the most shattering, sorrowful and heart-wrenching moments of the film there's a suppressing beauty withering its way onto the screen. The wonderfully impressive shots of the British countryside setting the scenes for the overwhelming clouds with pouring sunlight squeezing its way through show the comprehensive beauty the world has on offer. The fact the film was shot in natural light, it shown through the wide and ambitious landscape surrounding Barry Lyndon. It shows how there is such a great deal of life surrounding us all and yet we seem blissfully unaware of this.Generally the film's technical aspects cannot be described by anything less than perfect. The mesmerising classical score the film holds helps to create the cold and anti-humanist idea the film is portraying. Another prime feature of Barry Lyndon is that Kubrick found his motivation through some of the 18th century's painters who have obviously helped Kubrick decide what costumes would be able to illustrate the period in time. Easily some of the most impressive and detailed items of clothing ever put on screen, deserving the Oscar for 'Best Costume Design'. The set pieces are also a fantastic part of the film and the realism is stunning. The use of British heritage to set the scenes for some of the housing, the sweeping fields of hills, the winding roads and the ruined half-castles provide the needed pragmatism.Some films that revolve around one character's travels can fail to capture the audience, but Barry Lyndon manages to expertly lead you through the shoes of Mr. Lyndon's life. You'll notice how his character changes as the film progresses, some of his characteristics, habits and usual emotions change. The film studies the arrogance, lying charm and sly individualism surrounding the anti-hero. Ryan O'Neal shows-off his outlandish and shy acting style perfectly with what is one of the untouchable performances of the 70s.The film remains a film buff's dream, a director's ambition and a historian's paradise. My all-time favourite film and one that remains one of the greatest achievements cinema has on offer, I beg you to watch this.",10,4,6,18 December 2006
Full Metal Jacket," As Deeply Flawed As It Is, I'd Still Take Kubrick's 'Nam Vision Over Stone's
","Of all the films spanning Stanley Kubrick's career, 1987's Full Metal Jacket has to be the weakest and most unorthodox of efforts, excluding his feature-length debut Fear and Desire. This was the director's penultimate work, and the one which holds testament to an artist's ability to embrace the fundamental genres of contemporary cinema. Such versatility is surely commendable; nevertheless, Kubrick unwittingly crafted what many would agree to be the worst of his career. In a decade of numerous anti-war features, produced in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, it is hard understanding why someone of Kubrick's calibre actually made this predicament of whimsical proportions. That is not to say this is not something of good intentions, but rather a work which drives its message home to such a degree that it conflicts the nature of its artist.Released seven years following The Shining, Full Metal Jacket marked the second Kubrick picture of the '80s. Twelve years later, Eyes Wide Shut was released posthumously a few months following Kubrick's death. I say this simply to note that Kubrick fortunately avoided finishing on such a questionable feature. The project was first penned in 1980, with the director considering directing a holocaust study, but eventually he opted for something Vietnam based. Two years later, the director stumbled upon The Short-Timers; a retrospective, semi-autobiographical novel written by war veteran Gustav Hasford. Screenwriter Michael Herr (previously famed for his other Vietnam screenplay, Apocalypse Now) was asked to write an adapted screenplay and while originally reluctant to do so, he eventually agreed. The screenplay eventually earned him an Academy Award nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay.Prior to filming, Kubrick spent many years researching the entire period of war; pouring over memoirs, documentaries, newspaper cuttings and any related information which could possibly contribute to the overall accuracy of the project. His commitment and dedication to being informed was a tradition Kubrick adopted before embarking on any film-making venture. As with Paths of Glory, it is purportedly claimed that Kubrick was not concerned in shaping a manifestation of anti-war, but instead wanted to matter-of-factly depict the nature of war, i.e. men transformed into killers.Commencing with a montage of young army recruits having their hair shaved off (allegory for the beginnings of dehumanisation), you instantly recognise that you are watching something relatively unique. The sudden cut to the army barracks, the stillness of the blank room and the abrupt barrage of profanity directed at the troops from Sgt. Hartman is both timidly amusing and brusquely alarming. It is the first 45 minutes of Full Metal Jacket which projects a mirage of greatness, with the whole time spent depicting the metamorphosis of young men turned born-again killing machines. This first act is in complete odds with the latter act; when the troops are placed in the combat zone. The film suddenly becomes desperately obnoxious, revolving around grown men making puerile jokes at each other and running around Vietnam aimlessly, with no conscience. I personally believe that the narrative should have remained in the barracks for the duration, simply presenting the viewer with the development of the soldiers, instead of also incorporating their war experiences.It is hard to pinpoint the exact problems with Full Metal Jacket, but I think, for the most part, it comes down to its inconsistencies. For one, very little actually occurs throughout the runtime and there is an icy lack of humanity in many of the scenes, but not in the comprehendible, Kubrickian way. Its ideologies and pathos are concealed by a desire to litter so many scenes with narcissistic humour, and so the audience looses its respect for the characters. On the other hand, the performances are, with all reason, up to scratch; particularly those performances from R. Lee Ermey as the inescapable drill-instructor and Vincent D'Onofrio's role as his pitiful victim. Beyond those two performances lies little else on the acting front, with most of the other performers' roles being compromised of heroic despondency and lashings of misunderstood cynicism. Most of all, the message of the film is entirely jumbled and to such an extent that it is in fact difficult to decipher the underlying crux of the ordeal. One thing is for certain that Kubrick perfectly demonstrates how much of a transformation regular men go through before entering war. Such is perhaps the only way man could cope with such a deathly periphery of mouldering principles.This is very much a work of undermined greatness, a meagre example of something which could have been great, but eventually became a rambling mishap, fuelled by ill-defined notions of grandeur. Throughout the '80s there was a string of hefty and effusive Vietnam pictures, some were good and some were bad. The ironic, tight-fisted Full Metal Jacket lay in the midst of it all and many acknowledged that it contained a concept which could have been so much more.",9,1,2,28 June 2006
American Psycho," A Cynical Social-Commentary, and One Which Is Irresistibly Relevant For Today's World
","Christian Bale is arguably modern cinema's most underrated actor. I sometimes consider hailing him as the greatest performer of this generation, particularly whenever I re-watch his leap-to-fame performance in American Psycho. On its release it erroneously received mixed acclaim; nevertheless, Bale was nearly always commended for performing in the remarkably charismatic role of Patrick Bateman. The character ranks among contemporary literature's greatest creations, and back in 2000 a young Bale somehow managed to embody the yuppie maniac. The character's slickly menacing demeanour, attentive idiosyncrasies, and always brewing revulsion is intuitively mastered in this offbeat satire. Patrick Bateman is both the definitive New York yuppie and the ultimate sociopath. He is masked by the Wall Street businessman persona, and his pastime activities are unnoticed by his self-obsessed associates- like himself. He thrives off a colossal maze of jealously, established on distaste for any minor, physical and social hiccup. Little do such men know that they are dehumanising any merit they once had.Bret Easton Ellis' original novel contains possibly the most graphic depictions of sex and violence in any novel I have ever read. Appropriately, director Mary Harron places much of the novel's explicit content off-screen, similar to how the book simply lets the reader imagine the vivid nature of the content. For this reason, American Psycho is faithful to its source, and for a novel which includes such terminal violence there is still a huge amount of wit and charm. This owes to the book's satirical disposition, with its brazen accuracy and jagged humour. It is in many respects an absurdist's take on an already surreal culture; this lends the questionable theme of subjective reality to the protagonist's actions and experiences. Mary Harron utilises the satirical facets of the novel, and essentially uses satire as a device of ridiculing yuppie culture. Nevertheless, the component which is best suited is that this image of an alpha-male dominated society, which is directed from a female standpoint, but not an overtly feminist one. More than anything, American Psycho is a critique of ignorance, materialism and self-infatuation.The cast play it cool throughout the feature, concurrently sinking their teeth into the bitter irony of cultural stereotypes. For those of you who might be put off by the sardonic title; don't be. This is a twisted and intelligent take on cultural archetypes, with much prominence being placed on whether the viewer deems Patrick Bateman's sociopath alter-ego a manifestation of sub-conscious monotony or that he is genuinely committing the murderous, masochistic acts shown on screen. Whichever way you look at it, there is no definitive answer, but one thing is for sure, that this cinematic assertion is a strong sentiment of yuppie narcissism. As dark as it may seem, there is no denying the indisputable entertainment quality of a film crammed with meaningful malevolence. This is a film which unsympathetically attacks the business world, implying that dumb people from wealthy backgrounds are groomed for slacker success. These white collar machines are not savvy, nor do they even so much as turn a blind-eye to anyone other than their materialistic statements of self-worth. In a way, this is their only means of clinging onto reality, for they hide behind their denial, with a reputable image of self-worth.",8,2,4,25 February 2008
North by Northwest," It's The Irony That Makes The Script Have So Much Originality and Intelligence
","I've always considered Hitchcock one of the finest directors in the way he can retain such versatility and have consistent quality of film throughout his entire career. Hitchcock was a master at creating and reviving genres; this personally never ceases to amaze me. North By Northwest could have so easily of been a 'run of the mill' thriller that had no elements of comedy or any kind of style. Luckily it makes a fast-paced piece of weekend entertainment.North By Northwest turns everything upside down. The quirky story of the film reacts to the surroundings so well and the famous locations are great choices for chase scenes and adrenaline action. This was action before action was really a genre and the classy script will make the viewer feel extremely satisfied. The script adds the comedy to the film and Cary Grant's tremendous style and class A acting ability is something one can never tire of. For example, the scene in the lift where everyone is laughing, Cary Grant's expression is just priceless. Cary Grant's acting ability impresses throughout the film and remains cool and collected. Cary Grant makes a clumsy/un-predictable 'James Bond' in North By Northwest and it remains one of his most iconic films that he starred in.Some may find the film hard to take seriously because it is very different to how you'd expect a Hitchcock film to be, yet it still has his trademark written all over it. The reason for this is the fact the story is goofy. The chemistry and added romance in the film works very well with the surrounding and creates a great atmosphere. The obvious sexual tensions that are scattered throughout the film show that North By Northwest was ahead of its time. The sexual innuendo is a high point for the film and the script's fast paced rhythm is what keeps the film moving so well.Hitchcock's direction works perfectly with the film and the vast variety of skills shows in some of the action scenes prove to be very exciting. The 'mother' attitude that is scattered throughout the film remains one of Hitchcock's trademark styles, which he then uses in his latter work 'Psycho'. Bar none one of the highest octane and entertaining films ever made, slick, stylish, sexy and downright thrilling.",9,0,0,3 September 2006
American Beauty," Bringing Life To The Silver-Screen. 'American Beauty' Skilfully Succeeds As A Film Almost Anyone Can Relate To
","Winner of Best Picture in 1999, American Beauty is perfection in the form of the lives we lead. Built with precision, accuracy, honesty and beauty there is no denying the film's naturalistic nature in depicting life, and how so many people lead their lives by consumerism, materialism and denunciation. Not only has American Beauty gained huge popularity around the world, but it has also benefited from large amounts of critical acclaim. American Beauty is a film which should be mentioned alongside the greatest debuts in cinema, as the director Sam Mendes was a British stage-director who gained the opportunity to bring to life, what is ultimately a personification of today's world. Meet Lester Burnham (performed by Kevin Spacey), a man just like so many others, a man who has been distanced by society and has become inconsequentially shunted to one side. His wife, Carolyn (Annette Bening) and daughter Jane (Thora Birch) are also having their own fair share of personal dilemmas and are struggling to cope with the insignificance of their lives. Lester decides that drastic action needs to turn his mundane mid-life around, so he takes a form of 'resurrection' by living his life in the way he wants to live it and accomplishing the freedom most men dream of. Instantly recognisable and indisputably distinctive, American Beauty taps inside the average person's day-to-day mendacity and portrays suburbia in all its heartless, yet beautifully oblivious glory. There are times in everyone's lives where you just want to break free. Which is what American Beauty is primarily about; how we all want to be spontaneously alive and not let others manipulate our actions, but instead become driven by personal compulsion. Having the desire to become an individual is what makes us human, which is one of the reasons why American Beauty has become 'the people's film'. Driven by its audacious energy and satirical humour the film blends and distinguishes what makes us human. Framed in a technique which subconsciously approaches beauty through heartache, American Beauty quietly compels its viewer inside a world which is remarkably familiar. Built on Alan Ball's (writer of the television series Six Feet Under) lyrical script the film becomes both brutally honest and poetically surreal. The script is paced in a way which helps the film shift with graceful timing, letting the performers delve inside their multi-dimensional characters. Packed with sarcastic wit, brutal sincerity and a tender edge, Alan Ball crafts the script with fantastic ease, letting everything flow with a delicate, yet sharply dry rhythm. The ability to craft American Beauty as an epic study of life through fantastically entertaining storytelling is something I admire.The fluid editing and brilliantly controlled narrative crafts the film with a refined periphery. The use of jump-cuts, stylistic moulding and atmospheric lighting all help to make the film a pure joy to watch. Then you have the incredible cinematography, which blends fantasy and realism with an elusive ease. The gentle cinematography is, quite literally, beautiful, with its fluid motions and glossing visual deception. Also, the use of lens differentiation, wide lens takes and long takes highlight the characters' emotions; with the addition of the lighting everything feels so special. I adore the use of metaphorical imagery, such as the reoccurring bars to represent Lester being 'caged' in a fake environment. Plus, there is a remarkably haunting image of characters being reflected through mirrors, which is one of the important themes of American Beauty. All this is played against Thomas Newman's majestic and unforgettable score, which subconsciously buries itself inside the back of the viewer's mind. I find it extraordinary just how every single actor and actress adopts all the mannerisms, enabling the ability to construct complex characters. From facial expressions to hand movements, every action can be felt. Kevin Spacey embodies the role of Lester Burnham with concise relativity and bitter openness, becoming the everyday man living a fragile existence. Kevin Spacey also proves his brilliance through even the subtlest elements, such as the poignant voice-over he gives at both the beginning and end of the film. Annette Bening also gives a glaringly accurate portrayal of a self-absorbed woman who has been turned into a 'bitch' by the desire to fit in with society's stereotypes. Even the young performers give some of the most memorably true-to-form performances I have had the pleasure of viewing. Desperation and loss has rarely been dealt with such a harsh amount emotional realism. Even when the film is bursting with entertainment and wit, there is always an underlying tone of sadness. What American Beauty says is not exactly happy, but it is unbearably honest, being that we are all victimised (in some form) by the society we live in. Yet, American Beauty is outstandingly uplifting, in the sense that the film says that it is possible to be content with the lives we lead. American Beauty is a masterpiece, which brings theatre and disheartening pragmatism with an overwhelming calm and tender sense of beauty. A film which could possibly change your life, or at least your perceptions on it.",8,0,1,10 June 2007
Collateral," 'Collateral' Is A Human Thriller, A Cold-Toned Noir and A Moralistic Character Study All Rolled Into One
","Director Michael Mann has many trademarks, most notably his use of colours, particularly blue. He also has a knack for making 'bad guys' deal with their own personal anguish; hypothetically speaking when this is rolled together with the previously mentioned trademark Mann creates a vividly calming and transfixing image of a character's personal struggle. This is just proof that Michael Mann is one of the most innovative directors working in modern American cinema.Max (played by Jamie Foxx) is a somewhat melancholy L.A. cab driver, a kind-hearted man who just wants to make some money and be able to offer his customers a smooth cabbie service. One night he picks up Vincent (Tom Cruise) who at first strikes the viewer as a mysterious businessman. Yet it quickly becomes apparent that he is actually a professional contract-killer. Max becomes the forced driver for Vincent and Vincent's psychopathic tendencies become more evident and cold-hearted as the film moves on.The film holds some of the finest cinematography modern cinema has to offer, it is so vibrant and vigorous in style that it is impossible to keep you eyes off the screen. The beauty of it is how entrancing it is, blending both illusive misconceptions and realistic character-driven drama. The film is strongly presented by its bold 'digital camera' affect, creating a believable atmosphere and emphasising the feeling of a drawn-out night. It is also apparent that the film has shades of noir etched onto the surface, creating a convincing vision of the viewer becoming a passenger in the cab. Collateral captures lighting perfectly, ranging from illuminating car headlights to the wide-stretching street lamps. There is such a fantastic amount of range to the camera work, which differentiates between close-contact shots, which focus on the emotions of the characters to overhead shots scraping the sprawling L.A. night. The editing is another strong area of the film. It is extremely slick and cut with razor-sharp elegance, plus the edition of some wonderfully fitting music. There is something very natural about the technical side of Collateral, reinforcing Mann's 'auteur' ability and perceptive vision of Hollywood's crime genre.The acting is dealt with a great enthusiasm and it is a shame the actors are working with what is a generally uneven script. Yet actors Jamie Foxx and Tom Cruise overcome the obstacle by delving inside their characters and both being cast as characters which are unusual to some of their other career choices. Both prove to have strong versatility, dealing with their characters emotions and personality with a simplistic ease and helping to move the film along at a respectable pace. Both actors add a consistent amount of dimension to their roles, helping the film to become a character-study and letting the viewer perceive their own view of the events taking place.When revisiting Collateral I find it truly terrifying to how fast technology is moving in today's world. This may sound strange, but a lot of the technology in Collateral has already advanced leaps and bounds in the case of a few years. It is scary just how quickly our world is moving and how technology is a key part in most of our lives. Ironically, there is a scene in the film whereby Vincent expresses his formality on how short a person's life is. So is this an intentional example of subtext in the film, attempting conveying the speed in which the world goes by? It is questionable when you take into context how Collateral is a film which runs at an exceedingly fast pace due to its consistent level of thrills and capturing how fast time goes under stress. It is a shame that there are some flaws in the narrative, script and acting (from the extra cast members) because they sadly stop the film from gaining a true 'masterpiece' status.Collateral is Michael Mann on top-form, it is the different 'cop vs. killer' story, one which goes against the expected formulaic pattern and so succeeds in creating what is a meticulous tour de force in modern film-making. Collateral is a film not to be missed and certainly comes close to being mentioned alongside some of Mann's superlative achievements.",8,4,5,23 April 2007
The Exorcist," Prolonged Agony Which Buries Itself Deep Inside One's Subconscious
","Possibly the most widely controversial mainstream film ever made, The Exorcist has been terrifying viewers for more than thirty years. In 1973 people would flock to view the film which was reportedly 'the most harrowing motion-picture of all-time.' Although the content of the film might not shock viewers of today, the irrefutable nature of the traumatic events that unfold are likely to silence even the most hard-bitten viewers. Instead of bringing 'low-key thrills' through shock-tactics, The Exorcist establishes horror through the progressively distressing notion of an innocent girl becoming demoniacally possessed and therefore undertaking sacrilegious acts.After winning Best Picture at the Oscars for The French Connection, William Friedkin became one of the most talked-about Hollywood directors. From this success, Warner Brothers decided to allow Friedkin to direct William Peter Blatty's novel The Exorcist. Best Sound and Best Adapted Screenplay (Blatty adapted his own novel) were the two Oscars awarded to The Exorcist. The academy is notorious for their bias stance towards particular genres, but Friedkin's masterpiece is one of a handful of horror films which the academy did in fact recognise as a genuine triumph.Twelve-year-old Regan MacNeil (played by a teenage Linda Blair) is living in Washington D.C. with her mother Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn). While in Washington, Regan begins to develop bizarre symptoms of what-seems-to-be an obscure, psychological disorder. Distraught and becoming more worried by the day, Chris decides to take Regan to a clinic. After numerous tests the doctors cannot define what is wrong with Regan and eventually resort to suggesting a so-called means of 'shock treatment' a.k.a. exorcism. Chris decides to seek help from the Catholic Church; eventually hiring a sceptical priest to examine Regan's violent behaviour. Opening in an archaeologist ground and finishing in the suburbs of Washington D.C., The Exorcist conveys many varying transitions; including, science vs. religion and the fundamental theme of good battling evil.Littered with subliminal (demonic statues/faces) and metaphorical imagery (the subway staircase as a descent to hell) and scenes of blasphemy, The Exorcist is a deeply religious film which expertly applies a method of crawling under the viewer's skin. Building an ambiance for approximately 40 minutes The Exorcist resists the temptation to spew lashings of extreme gore and alternatively takes a subtle approach towards a touchy subject. Slow, boiling tensions can be noted near the very start of the film when there is a shot of Father Merrin (Max von Sydow's character) standing opposite the statue of a devil. The dessert sands roll and a greying darkness spreads over the screen, this shot symbolises the conflict between good and evil, while foreshadowing the events that Father Merrin acknowledges but are yet to come. The uncompromising methods of film-making used in The Exorcist question the viewer to such an extent that analysing almost becomes a lost-cause. Drawing parallels between science and religion (in the film religion is shown as a last resort) the unrequited sensation broke barriers of how spirituality could be portrayed through art. A persistent theme is the infiltration of the body, both by medical science and possession, which also drives the fundamental element of desecration. Nonetheless, the performances in The Exorcist are unquestionably persuasive because of the eloquent delivery that each actor abides to. Max von Sydow, Ellen Burstyn, Linda Blair and the most underrated of them all, Jason Miller, all showcase the utmost talent and bestow their most matchlessly penetrating performances. The sheer audacity and belligerent disposition makes every aspect all the more satisfying. Edited in a manner which utilises the environment, The Exorcist never fails to keep the attention of its viewers. Much of the film resembles a polished and distinguishable example of pristine film-making, which engulfs and drains all sentiment. This leaves an impressionable level of numbness long after the credits have rolled.The Exorcist ranks as one of the most challenging and evocative works of art to be released in American cinema. Nothing can prepare you for the overwhelming experience of William Friedkin's exceptional mélange of humanistic drama and staggering horror. It may traumatise, so be wary, but do not be put off from viewing a film which questions one's perception of religion, and can easily be stated as a definitive masterpiece of cinema. Summarising my respect for The Exorcist is an impossible task to perform, so this is merely a futile attempt at nailing it.",9,3,5,19 October 2007
The Dirty Dozen," Psychos, Thieves, Rapists, ThugsGive A Warm Welcome To 'The Dirty Dozen'
","Back in 1967 The Dirty Dozen was a very controversial film because it went against everything the army stood for and so was nearly not able to be made. Luckily it did and still today it stands as one of the greatest action/war movies ever made and it still rings with its anti-war message. If you want to know what kind of a film The Dirty Dozen is I'd say it's a cross between Full Metal Jacket and Animal House, strange right? The thing about The Dirty Dozen is it is very different to most other war films and with the added comedy you've got something very unique. Most importantly The Dirty Dozen proves that to be a good solider you have to break a few rules.From the cold opening monologue to the explosive finale you've got yourself a film that sets a standard for how to make an action movie years and years since. The Dirty Dozen is famous for its wonderful ensemble cast that provides humour as well as study. All of the 12 men trained by Lee Marvin the cold head of command are ex-convicts and all of them are some of the most twisted people known to man. The film studies the violence on and behind the war zone. The Dirty Dozen entertains as well as an insight; this is great in my opinion. Some people say The Dirty Dozen can't be taken seriously, I sure think it can. Even though the film is a comedy it still is a serious film in many places. The film has managed to place itself in 60s pop culture for being so iconic. The film's acting from the entire cast remains on top throughout the entire film. If you think about The Dirty Dozen is a disturbing film, the segment with the gasoline and grenades being poured down the shafts is done in such a odd fashion that you'll find it hard to grasp it.The film's style is one that remains as cool as it was back in 1967. The editing is very cleanly cut and The Dirty Dozen's pace runs with a rhythm still keeping its substance. Many of the camera shots and the final, body count filled massacre has a certain feel of excellence to it. You can really feel the time spent on creating set pieces, acting ability, direction etc. The Dirty Dozen's atmosphere from all this is a menacing dark one, the fact it's menacing is because of the added humour and the dark because of the whole crazy idea. The film does run smoothly and feels very tight because there are no subplots and the fact that everything is so precise. The Dirty Dozen is a movie that has been spawned with carbon copy films and TV sequels.The script is one of great originality because it mixes sardonic humour with great speeches and one-liners. You'll be sure to have a favourite character by the end of the film. Many of the cast and characters have gone down in history providing a great step up for the cast's careers. Charles Bronson. And Donald Sutherland are probably some of the most recognisable to the viewer today. The Dirty Dozen remains a sharp, raw and stark film through its two and a half hour running time. So you can either watch The Dirty Dozen in two ways, one to study the army through a wide open image or secondly as a highly entertaining action movie. The most important question The Dirty Dozen make the viewer ask is none other than 'Is this what the army is really like?' I'd say it is and by making a film that shows that the best war men are criminals Robert Aldrich has created an anti war statement.",8,5,9,17 August 2006
Grave of the Fireflies," Finding Love, Compassion and Solitude In Even The Darkest Moments
","There is no denying that Studio Ghibli is the finest animation company ever and have made some of the most stunning pieces of cinema ever. The fact that they never fail to craft some of the most beautiful and compelling masterpieces proves the brilliance. Ghibli animators make films that are intelligent, fulfilling, complex and burst with joy. The animation is one that can appeal to people of all walks of life and perfectly sums up what cinema is all about. I've never once been disappointed by a Studio Ghibli work.Grave Of The Fireflies is certainly far from easy viewing and is one of the most harrowing war films ever made. When released in America Grave Of The Fireflies caused controversy because some people felt it was anti-American and the fact is that it's not. The film doesn't take sides to anyone and understands that everybody did awful and horrific things during WW2. One thing that is obvious when watching the film is the fact it's anti-war and shows how the innocent are the people who become the most effected.It's not easy to make films about subjects like this one because they become very emotional and hard to make realistic. Yet Grave Of The Fireflies succeeds in every way other war films don't. The story is a magnificent tale of love and friendship between an older brother and his young sister. The loss of innocence and the real-life brutality that these children see are something that nobody would ever want or be prepared for.The cinematography is beautiful and every frame of animation holds so much substance and inner beauty. There are very few films that manage to play with my emotions as easily as Grave Of The Fireflies because it remains a haunting study of a brother and sister's friendship. I found it hard not to cry and I'll be honest I did cry towards the end of the film. The fact that you fall in love with the characters and become attached to their personality, surroundings and situations is why it remains so provocative. The film's style is excellent and helps set a perfect mood. I love the use of operatic music at the end of the film as it was profoundly effecting.A genuine masterpiece of cinema, one of the greatest animations (anime), one of the greatest war films and one of the greatest films ever made. Recommended for anyone of any age, a film with mass appeal and wide range. Holds a wonderful message and a genuinely inspiring story. Sheer brilliance for what is such a daring piece of film-making.",10,8,9,24 October 2006
The Evil Dead," A Franticly Satirical and Endlessly Innovative Gorefest Which Launched A Thousand Ships
","Infamous for a variety of reasons, The Evil Dead remains a landmark for cinema as a whole. In 1981 the film was banned, cut or had a delayed release in many countries as it was deemed both sadistic and gratuitously explicit. In the UK the film was originally released cut like in many other countries, yet when the film was due to hit video it was banned by the BBFC. It became notorious for being one of the first 'video nasties' and it was not until 1990 that the film became 'unbanned' by the BBFC. Fortunately, when released on DVD in 2001 all the cuts were waved, and since then the film has been widely available in its uncut and intended form. When viewed in the new era most of the film's material is fairly tame in comparison to the content of today's horror films.The premise of The Evil Dead is one which is so basic that it enabled Sam Raimi to create something so blissfully unique and absurd. The film kicks off with introducing five friends who are journeying to an isolated cabin. On arriving, they find a mysterious book (The Book of the Dead/Necronomicon) and a tape recording from a professor. Out of curiosity they decide to listen to the unsettling recording, which reads out an ancient curse. This results in 'the evil dead' being released and wreaking possessive havoc on the innocent group of friends.Though The Evil Dead follows a simplistic story, and one which might even seem clichéd to viewers today, it was still a glaringly unique film for its time and has spawned influence across cinema. Arguably, the lack of a complex or even recognisable narrative structure acts as a way of making the film focus and succeed in all its other areas. Due to the lack of narrative, Sam Raimi is able to emphasise the 'exploitation' side of the film and let his astonishing array of imagination flow through the picture. Some might dispute that The Evil Dead should not follow a story anyway, as it is a film whereby the aim is to depict survival through 'gruelling terror'.When you break-down The Evil Dead (analysing each area of the film); I find it hard to comprehend how anyone could refuse to respect the painstaking effort which went into achieving the best out of a tiny budget. The attention to detail in factors such as make-up, camera-work, animatronics, editing, lighting and atmosphere remains an astonishing achievement. Sam Raimi litters the film with B-movie flourish and classic horror references. This is a mark of respect for the films which helped to inspire many areas of The Evil Dead.The use of quick-cut editing focusing on tiny details is something which became extremely stylish in the sequel, yet not quite as raw. This is an example of how The Evil Dead is supposed to be scary at times. One of the film's most famous factors is the first-person camera shots of 'the evil' rushing through the woods and around the key set-piece (the cabin). This has become a trademark style for the series; The Evil Dead is both amusing (yet this became much more apparent in the sequels, which ultimately became self-parodies) and fairly creepy. Yes, some moments may seem horribly corny and dated now, but it is something you should expect from such a film. My favourite aspect of the film is Bruce Campbell's performance as Ash, which although extremely cringe-worthy at times is indisputably bursting with panache and charm. Bruce Campbell established himself as a cult favourite due to the series, and rightly so. He honestly is one of the finest character-actors of all-time, a genius of physical comedy and an expert in the art of exaggeration. His acting talent is something which improved as his career progressed, but he is still widely recognised for being the lovable imbecile and protagonist of The Evil Dead.The Evil Dead kicked off a cult following and introduced what was to become one of the greatest trilogies of all-time. There is no denying the sheer fury and excitement The Evil Dead carries with each viewing. Ultimately, it is the low budget that enables the film to still pack an unnerving jolt of exhilaration.",8,5,6,26 May 2007
Annie Hall," I Think Of 'Annie Hall' As The Cynic's Parallel To 'It's a Wonderful Life'. I Like That Contrast
","Revisiting Annie Hall is like meeting up with a friend you have not seen in years, it really is that personal. I find it hard to comprehend as to how anyone could not find some sort of connection with the film's honesty. The film's bond with its viewer is quite possibly the key basis as to why the film is so globally admired, as it is a film which both men and women can relate to. Not only this, but Annie Hall offers the viewer the idea that they are not alone in their disillusion of love, and that it is human nature for the majority of love to quite literally fade away with time.Annie Hall is another bittersweet, charming and identifiable tale of romance, but from Woody Allen's cynical point of view. Set in New York, Woody Allen is arguably performing as himself, a neurotic comedian named Alvy Singer, who is struggling to balance his love life, while tackling his own self-reservations and negative outlooks on life. The film charts his erratic lifestyle by looking at his experiences, exaggerating them and attempting to understand where he went wrong. Woody Allen accomplishes all this through hysterically unique narrative-cuts, including questioning the viewer and showing his urge to of spoken his mind in a particular situation.Annie Hall is both a bleak film, while also being an oddly uplifting one, and a film which I find considerably therapeutic. Bursting with intellect and philosophy, Annie Hall remains Woody Allen's definitive masterpiece, the film which defines both him and his career. The film's beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and although there is a fair amount of bleak cinematography there is still no denying the beauty that lies in the film's final montage. The charming sequence defines everything Woody Allen wanted to say about life and how everything is a series of frantic events.Annie Hall is widely regarded for possessing one of the finest scripts of all-time, and rightly so. Few scripts burst with such a fierce amount of fiery, sharp humour and cultural knowledge. Using devastating heart-break to side-splitting one-liners, the film continuously succeeds in letting each actor and actress deliver their line with perfect comedic essence. Flowing with misery and negativities the script feels so true to its form. Mixing tragedy with humour is a technique Woody Allen has mastered. The brutal honesty is highly effective as it sufficiently represents moments that we all go through in life. The script's use of sexual irony and sexual innuendo is apparent in almost every scene, delightfully representing both genders' outlook on sex. The script pontificates over its characters, which are all flawed in some way, yet all so delightfully charismatic. Rather than being a one-track, simple-minded comedy, Annie Hall develops its themes, rather than carelessly glossing over them.In Annie Hall the actors and actresses do not look glamorous, or even close to Hollywood stars. They look natural, and that is what helps the film slide away from being the clichÃ©d American romance. It is actually a method which enables the film to become a symbol of the average person's life. Not only this, but the narrative is presented in a revolutionary manner, altering the average occurrence (such as a dinner party) into a study of a person's physical gestures, this is a way of representing what a person is thinking. Woody Allen is offering the viewer a psychological analysis of the lives we live. Woody Allen uses time as a method of gaining a perspective of the events in Alvy Singer's love-life. Even when the narrative is told in a non-linear style the film still pieces itself together through editing, hence the film is not chaotic, but the romance is. The disconnected editing and transitions actually help to embody the sporadic and nervous relationship, while seemingly portraying the varied speed and detachment our lives move at.The performances all help to make Annie Hall the film it is today, Diane Keaton and Woody Allen have perfect chemistry and both create emotional parallels for their characters. To add to the organic experience of Annie Hall, all the stutters, unfinished sentences, delayed responses and mispronounced words are used during conversation. Do not forget to look out for the variety of small, yet highly amusing cameos from some of America's most famous actors and actresses.Suffice to say, Allen's awkward humour is an acquired taste and I would recommend it being a necessity to become familiar with his work before being able to appreciate Annie Hall to its best extent. To some, the humour is subtle; to others, it is openly hysterical. Although, the one thing everyone can agree on is the film's innovation, even if you do refuse to believe that love does not prevail. But really, Woody Allen is aware that Annie Hall is funny because everything about it is all so true and he can see the humour behind his own unhappiness.",9,2,4,28 May 2007
A Clockwork Orange," Yes, It Certainly Is One Of The Most Essential Pieces Of Cinema. The Amount Of Influence and Power 'A Clockwork Orange' Has Had On The World Is Truly 'Majestical'
","Controversy is a popular aspect in the world of art, people flock to see something that is seen to be offensive or shocking in one form or another. This goes for the infamous A Clockwork Orange, famously known for being one of the most controversial films of all-time. I would say it lives up to its title, especially when you look at it from the perspective of a viewer in '71. A Clockwork Orange still holds up today as being a frighteningly disturbing portrait of a ruthless mind. Though not quite as graphic as one might expect, the film holds no bars on its disturbingly genuine nature and shocking content, though all of this is a primary factor of the film's moral. A Clockwork Orange is neither exploitive, nor degrading because all the content is in equilibrium with the importance and startling impact of the film.Adapted from Anthony Burgess' novel, A Clockwork Orange follows the futuristic story of the foul, repulsive and oddly intelligent sickening screwball Alex de Large (Malcolm McDowell) and his gang of 'droogs'. They prowl the nights with their disgusting habits of terror and take out their undesirable temperament on the unsuspecting public. Alex eventually gets arrested and put upon a scientific rehabilitation program which is supposed to make the degenerates of society 'normal people' and eventually making it impossible for Alex to commit any kind of wrongdoing. The experiment does not quite go according to plan for the young hoodlum.For a film of such fierce, challenging, depressing and wildly vivid nature there is still so much wonder and beauty to be found from it. The sheer magnitude of the film's unparallelled intelligence, entertainment value and ingenuity is something that will grasp even the most easily offended or unpredictable of viewers. Whether you like or dislike A Clockwork Orange remains to be seen (yes, it is certainly a film that does not appeal to all tastes) because you will undoubtedly respect for many reasons.The audacious title, 'A Clockwork Orange' is quite possibly the finest film-title ever imagined, it helps you understand the film and primarily represents the 'controlled mechanism for maintaining society'. Ultimately, Alex becomes artificial on the outside, while still being perverted at heart. The number of morals and ethics discussed throughout the film is something that deserves the utmost appreciation of the literature essays the novel and film receives in schools around the world. Violence is an emblem of human nature, yet it is something that should be restrained and compressed through self-control. The film shows how even the most cruel and vile of human beings still have humane rudiments. The film goes into studying youth frustration, the rebellion in youth, individuality, philosophy, the breeding of control, , society ranks, conformity, realising one's problems, being 'somebody' rather than 'something', freedom (being reborn/revitalised) and how violence breeds violence. The film gives such a wonderful message and also morals for its viewers, yet sadly it is one that has been cruelly misinterpreted by the more immature viewers. The film's final line sums up a lot about what I have mentioned above in the notoriously clear, resounding and extraordinary image. Legendary director Stanley Kubrick gives a visionary adaptation from page to screen, giving the film a versatile and unique quality. The use of colourful and techno set-pieces creates the mad-world, which is so close to our own. There are so many tiny details the film holds, everything from the astonishingly unforgettable makeup to the masterful facial expressions from Malcolm McDowell all help to create a timeless experience in visceral film-making. The adaptable use of poetic slang makes you apart of the gang experience, putting you into the shoes of the one of the ultimate anti-heroes. It is poetry brimming with a glorious elegance and harsh boldness. The use of quirky dark comedy is hysterical and at the same time bewildering helping to make the viewing even more immersive. The editing it magnificently displayed through a graceful use of slow-motion and fast-forward scenes, the film's bare style is truly stunning. Malcolm McDowell's performance is one of the greatest character performances of all-time, Kubrick's casting decision is beyond perfect offering an actor the role of a lifetime.Some people have accused this vivid spectacle of a social commentary of being self-absorbed or aching mass attention. I don't see A Clockwork Orange as that, rather it's quite the opposite, it gives people a discussion point and a discussion point that questions one's own views. A Clockwork Orange asks the viewer for their own opinion and their own conclusion for a story that is so surreal, yet, still being so sincere about the society we live in.",9,2,4,26 February 2007
Total Recall," A Satirical Technological Commentary, While Still Being An Enjoyable Sci-Fi Romp
","Danish director, Paul Verhoeven, released his first American film in 1987; this was RoboCop, an action film which has since become situated in a league of its own. Not only was it a hit in the Western world, but a global box-office bragger and a critically acclaimed triumph. Subsequent to the success, Verhoeven was chosen to direct a film adapted from a novella by Philip K. Dick ('We Can Remember It for you Wholesale') and turned it into the 1990 action classic, Total Recall. Two surprisingly intelligent action films made in succession allowed Verhoeven to become an established film-maker, who was at liberty to take the content of mainstream films distinctly further.Arnold Schwarzenegger took leading-man once again for Total Recall, just like the majority of films he starred in during the '80s and '90s. As with The Terminator, Predator and even Commando; his artificial and easy-to-mock acting went centre stage once again. Even though Schwarzenegger is far from being named a great actor, he is certainly situated as one of the most likable and satisfying (from a Blockbuster standpoint). His deadened approach is what makes his roles so true their form, and he is nearly always playing characters with seemingly robotic personalities. Growing up watching 'Arnie actioners' is something I have always treasured, which is why his films are cherished memories and also the reason for making re-watches such an electrifying event.Fusing reality with delusion (in what is essentially a case of identity crisis) is the core theme of Total Recall. Recurring -the now too-close-to-home- ideas of technological corruption reluctantly controlling a man's livelihood is hardly a topic which lacks the option of philosophical debate. In fact, for the action/science-fiction genre Verhoeven works wonders in making what seems to be a relatively stable, easy-going mainstream archetype into something which speaks out on politics and technology. Indeed, with the rapid increase and reliability on technology there is no doubt that us consumers will eventually resort to purchasing faulty, radioactive brain implants. Sadly, I am not joking, as I do believe that the foreseeable future of technology's control over our lives is inevitable.Total Recall worked wonders for special-effects and make-up during the beginning of the '90s. Lifelike mutants and grand set-pieces, including architecture resembling art-deco and prefabricated design drove the film's ambiance. As with most action films the average shot length (ASL) is visibly short, but is acceptable for a film of its kind and works adequately when put in conjunction with the ultra-violent fight scenes. Villains are stereotypical, heroes sprout graciously eccentric one-liners ('Consider it a divorce!') and the array of characters are befuddling, but these are mere reasons why Total Recall is a cinematic product of its time, which still foreshadowed future possibilities.If you are a person who takes everything far too seriously, then Total Recall is not appropriate viewing. However, if you are prepared to have an open-mind and realise that action films can still be clever (in this case due to a fantastically wrapped screenplay) you are likely to acquire a barrel of rip-roaring violence and furtive intellect. All too regularly is the film misconstrued as a meaningless American blockbuster, something it actually refrains from potentially becoming.",7,10,16,31 October 2007
Eyes Wide Shut," Kubrick's Misunderstood Masterpiece, Constructed On A Daring and Visionary Scope Of Allegory
","Eyes Wide Shut has become infamous for a variety of reasons, since it is the last film Stanley Kubrick ever completed, and even then some still argue that Eyes Wide Shut never got the final cut which was intended by Kubrick before he deceased. I know many people who have seen the film for the individual reason of expecting numerous levels of erotically-charged sex. Fortunately, those viewers found something which was entirely unforeseen. Many critics 'flamed' the film upon release, yet as each year goes by Eyes Wide Shut receives increasing critical acclaim. Another controversy was the fact that the film avoided its NC-17 by censoring the notorious orgy scene, which infuriated American audiences. Much mystery and speculation surrounds the film, making everything all the more fascinating. All of this and more comes down to one thing, the fact that Kubrick was a director who changed the face of cinema, revolutionising the way a film could be composed through even its most intricate of features.It was during the production of Eyes Wide Shut -which lasted a considerable amount of time- that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman were in the middle stage of their marriage. Two years after the release of the film the couple filed for divorce. In the film, they perform as a married couple who suddenly befall a dysfunctional relationship after the experience of one party. This leads the couple to become wary of one-an-other and a state of surreal desire washes over Dr. William Harford (played by Tom Cruise) who suspects his wife of adultery after she admits some dark secrets through drug-induced paranoia. After viewing Eyes Wide Shut, dissect the film's features carefully, given that you will gain much more hindsight.Ironically, it was two years subsequent to Eyes Wide Shut that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman ended their 11-year relationship. I find this interesting, since the film details topics such as martial fidelity. The narrative is composed through a somewhat fractured, distant and cold environment, epitomised by the 'vigilante quest' that Tom Cruise's character embraces. You quickly realise that you have become a fellow protagonist in the experiences of Eyes Wide Shut, never quite knowing what is around the most ambiguous of corners. The human psyche is a difficult emotion to convey through acting, let alone directing. When released, Eyes Wide Shut was considered out-of-touch with the film-making of its time, yet I would say the film was a long way ahead of the cinema being released during the '90s. For example, the film studies many social trends buried inside the infrastructure of modernised society. A book of sociology can be seen during one scene, perfectly placed to echo Kubrick's own motifs.Arguably, Kubrick offers his fans a surreal take on a desire which affects every man and woman at some point in their life. Something that is important to be acknowledged when comprehending Eyes Wide Shut is that the majority of it was filmed on a soundstage at Pinewood Studios, London. At the time of release, critics argued that this made the film feel 'unlike New York', yet this was an intention of the film. It echoes the surreal, dream-like state of the film, conveying the nature of a wide environment, which opens the viewer to personally analyse the features included within the gapingly open landscape. Eyes Wide Shut is a film whereby every aspect is open, such as the characters being exposed to let their own emotions walk free through an indistinct style of script-writing. The film is one which is open to viewer elucidation; even the title of the work has been debated as being the key to supporting the often cited 'dream theory'.Built on an ambiance resembling that of a period-drama, the film actually has many elements of tension, some might even go so far as to say horror. When you look at a scene, like that of the infamous masked-orgy sequence there is a real dread that starts to build up within the viewer, since the environment is superficially unnerving, bizarre and ultimately quite terrifying. The danger presented within the scene is that of an authoritative nature, which does not manipulate the audience, but instead makes them think about the people behind the masks. Yet, it is notably apparent that the sequence is not only a study of lust, covetousness suspicion and the craving for psychological stability, but it is also metaphorically speaking- a look at high-class society members at a substantial advantage in power.The copious use of the 'Kubrickian' steadicam is that of significant poise, resonated by the trademark tracking-shots of Kubrick, which subtly scrutinise environments to a profoundly postured degree. The use of Italian architecture and sceptically shadowed lighting igniting the film's scenery and character's emotions plays an important role for much of the subtext. The abrasive, menacing score polarises the personality of the key players within the narrative, helping make everything all the more analytical in its refined style. A fundamental aspect of the feature is the allegory and allusions created by the use of paintings, sculptures, architectures and the dream-states which are personified through the screenplay. Another crucial basis of Eyes Wide Shut is the fact it is depicting barren, upper-class individuals who need to find a connotation to their lives, primarily due to the frustration that has been gained through boredom. This is all shown through the faultless acting from Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, who both offer the finest performances of their careers, bursting with unquestionable flavour and chemistry. The expressionistic technicalities should be contrasted against the complex hypothesis of the film.Eyes Wide Shut deserves to be watched multiple times for the viewer to fully digest and appreciate the experience of what is an unprecedented, flawless and misjudged masterpiece which delves inside the darkest realms of human psyche. Even if you are one of the haters, I know for a fact that it is impossible for you to forget a film like Eyes Wide Shut.",10,2,4,24 July 2007
Some Like It Hot," One Of The Most Delightfully Entertaining Films Ever Made; 'Some Like It Hot' Remains The Definitive Screwball Comedy
","Throughout cinema history there have been many historic comedians, all varying in style and range. From the likes of Chaplin and Keaton to the Pythons and the Coens and to directors like Billy Wilder. Wilder is a man who never failed to create the perfect slice of entertainment, as he once said 'movies should be like amusement parks'. Although, Some Like It Hot is a flawed film and not on the same level as Wilder's true cinematic masterpieces it still remains a highly accomplished work of entertainment. And there are no wonders as to why it was ranked no.1 on AFI's 'Funniest Movies of All-Time'; it truly is a spectacle in the art of comedy.Some Like it Hot contains one of the most simple, yet wonderfully unique premises of all-time. Set during the prohibition Some Like It Hot follows the mishaps of two male musicians who are looking for a job, while being caught up with the mob. Unable to find work they opt in to play for a female band and so have to cross-dress to gain 'discreet' access to the band. Surprisingly both fit in with the group and quickly befriend Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), a friendship that soon develops into them both falling for her...The idea of Some Like It Hot is incredibly outlandish and extraordinarily outrageous. The film's complex was a long way ahead of its time and one that was risqué and daring on release due to the supposed 'homosexuality' portrayed in the film. Today, the film remains one of the triumphant examples of comedy, ultimately being a satire on '20s America portrayed through slyly hysterical humour. The film shows off the talents of Wilder and the array of talent he has cast on the film. The rampant script propels the film at extraordinarily fast pace and uses subtle metaphysical language to portray half-disguised sexual-innuendo. The sexual-innuendo remains one of the film's highlights due to the way it is incorporated into the script through fast wit, raunchiness and 'flashy' language. To simply imply the script is 'good' is an understatement; the script's craftsmanship is beyond the realm of genius and is so goofy, screwy and intelligent that it is impossible to deny the brilliance.Some Like It Hot is a film I can watch anytime, due to the amount of material and level of enjoyment on offer, it is a film bursting with charisma and charm. Actors Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are two of the finest American actors to ever grace cinema, their partnership created through the fantastic chemistry is inseparable. It is an example of pure character acting at the top of its game. Jack Lemmon (as with most of the films he starred in) steals the show with his wildly energetic, charismatic and 'fitting the role' performance. Jack Lemmon's persona is so uplifting, consistently succeeding in being the actor's actor. Then you have the hysterical Tony Curtis who brings bold hilarity and fierce energy to the screen, an actor who always feels suitably cast. Marilyn Monroe on the other hand is an actress I have always felt to be untalented at 'acting', yet skilled at working with spontaneous comedy and probably due to her own infamous personality. Although not a good actress, she is still cast with accuracy and slides into her role as Sugar with ease because of her own similarities to the character. She also adds another element of iconic value to the film.Although there is nothing much below the surface of Some Like It Hot that does not stop it from being an intellectual illustration of class A comedy. For a film so eccentric it is honestly amazing at how remarkably efficient the film is at succeeding in offering mass-appeal. Some Like It Hot is full of dry sexual tendencies, symbolic sexual imagery (yes, not only hidden in the script, but subtly shown throughout the film) and the indisputable class the film carries. The use of simple set-pieces helps rotate the comedy, offering impulsive comedic actions and a countless array of jokes.The film's notorious line 'well, nobody's perfect' goes for the film too. Although not as perfect as Wilder's 'league of their own' masterpieces (Sunset Blvd., The Apartment, Double Indemnity, Stalag 17) that still does not stop it from being a gem of cinematic joy. Wilder is one of the few directors who truly deserves his legendary directional and screen writing acclaim, it is beyond fact that Wilder had a genuine aptitude for cinema. Some Like It Hot is an example of Wilder's fantastic versatility and his trademark of dealing with warped identities.",8,1,2,4 April 2007
Pulp Fiction," The Ultimate Slice Of Culturally Significant Pop-Culture. 'Pulp Fiction' Is A Morality Piece Beyond Anything You've Ever Seen
","Following the success of 1992's Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino released his finest film to-date, the self-proclaimed masterpiece Pulp Fiction; a film which is arguably the most influential of the last few decades, and one which stands alone as a 'to-be' classic. Pulp Fiction remains widely regarded as one of the essentials in modern cinema, which has established itself as a film for the lovers of cinema, as those are the people it gets its greatest amount of admiration from. Pulp Fiction marked the new-wave, avant-garde cinema, it became recognised for its vigorously exciting flavour and unfathomable cool. Revolving around a deconstructed narrative, composed of three stories, which are all insanely surreal, Pulp Fiction brings you inside a world Quentin Tarantino has successfully crafted through individuality. The film starts with a lavishly entertaining conversation of tension and wit between two robbers, one being Tim Roth and the other being Amanda Plummer, who kick-start the film with furious energy. This scene is then followed by the infamous conversation of Amsterdam and burgers between the justifiable 'cool' of Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) and Vincent (John Travolta). From here on in you have entered a world fuelled by greed and missing-morality. Sure, Pulp Fiction is undoubtedly one of the 'coolest' and 'hippest' films around, nevertheless it holds much, much more than that. The film stands as a piece which depicts the psychology of normal people who have been thrown into extreme circumstances, meaning their personalities have changed along with their situation. It is a film which is much than amusingly clever on the surface, as in fact Pulp Fiction juggles allegory, such as the 'freedom' of Amsterdam being a counterpart for the film's non-conformist, disobedient nature. The film has countless recurring themes, such as redemption, vengeance, spirituality, morality, individual morals, and a person's mannerisms. Even behind the film's humorous anecdotes there is still a lingering sense of haunting poignancy the film throws upon its viewer. The inviting environments are simply an innovative showcase for a study of one's ethics and the dealing of horrendously problematical situations. The characters are all vigorously layered, with multi-dimensional emotions and spontaneous behaviour. When I say that every actor performs with undeniable perfection, I mean it. From Christopher Walken's cameo as Captain Koons, to Bruce Willis' alpha-male, yet kind-hearted 'boxer-thug' performance. Everyone in the film sets themselves a back-drop for their character, letting every character differentiate between one-an-other. Yet, as Harvey Keitel states in the film, 'of course you're character, but it doesn't mean you have character'.Dense script-writing, and what might seem like entirely irrelevant dialogue lets Pulp Fiction become its own piece. And rather than being driven by plot, the film is driven by its variety of surreal characters, who all talk in a way which seems so real. Yes, the conversations may not to be the same topic you talk about with another person, but the way in which a conversation branches off to an entirely different topic is something we all do in everyday life. Few films are able to portray dialogue through such a method, which is one of the countless reasons as to why Quentin Tarantino's script is the key instinctive foundation behind the film, since it lays the rules of what is to occur in a latter scene. The script crafts the comedy, as there are no comedic set-pieces in the film, nor is there a comedic narrative. However, the actors' delivery of nerve-biting, ego-driven lines, which brim with humour and emphasised body language, gives the film its distinguished tone of dark comedy. One of the reasons Pulp Fiction has become so iconic is due to its diversity in film-making, which is comprised of influences from French new-wave cinema, to Asian crime flicks, yet the film is still entirely original. Quentin Tarantino ultimately creates his own sense of 'bravo-film-making'. The use of tracking-shots, dolly-zooms, variation in lens focus, quick-cut editing, slow-motion sequences, lyrical camera positioning, steadicam tactics and close-up camera shots, the variety Pulp Fiction has is not just held within inside its narrative, but within its technical side too. Then you have the dynamic use of music, which has clearly been hand-picked by Quentin Tarantino himself and suits the film with a simplistic level of ease. The set-pieces are also crafted with scrutinising detail, such as the notorious lair, involving two hillbillies, a gimp and two of the film's protagonists.Pulp Fiction is, quite simply, a hard-boiled, noir-toned masterpiece of modern cinema, comprised of film-making which deserves to be dissected frame-by-frame. The sheer unadulterated consistency of greatness Pulp Fiction follows means it is a film which should be watched again and again. Yes, all the characters might be 'sinners', yet there is no denying that you will be rooting for a certain character(s) by the end of the film, as surely, with characters as diverse as these there must be someone you share the same belief with, right? Devine-intervention is what Pulp Fiction is, a miracle and one which justifies vast acknowledgement. Take for example Jimmy's (Quentin Tarantino) brief conversation on the 'gourmet' of coffee, it sums up the magnificence of Pulp Fiction perfectly, not forgetting the addition of 'lots of cream, lots of sugar'.",7,7,15,18 June 2007
The Departed," There Are The Few Exceptions Of A Remake Surpassing The Original Film, But This Is One Of Them. Just Too Good To Be True, A Scorsese Comeback
","Most people are like myself and when they hear of Hollywood remaking another masterpiece from the other side of the globe they will shudder and feel that it can be disrespectful to the original source. Not in the case of Marin Scorsese's The Departed, where he's back on form with what will no doubt be the best film by the end of 2006. When you hear that a master like Scorsese is going to direct a film like The Departed you suddenly get overwhelmed with the knowledge that you know it will be something special. The Departed is based on an Asian cop Vs criminal film named Infernal Affairs that since 2002 has managed to spawn 2 sequels and now the remake The Departed.When a director like Scorsese gets on a project like The Departed you know that you're in for a treat and with its wonderful cast you're going to be hard done not be impressed. There is a certain responsibility The Departed has and that's the fact it has to be respectful to Infernal Affairs and no steal the film's original premise. It has to keep the original story, but remember to make it individual and unique. So The Departed pays respect to Infernal Affairs while adding the needed significant changes and that's where The Departed succeeds.Whether you hate remakes or not all goes out the window because the film becomes a unique piece of work that only Scorsese could have done. Many other directors would have felt inclined to stay close to the tight knitted story, but Scorsese adds many changes and development so that he can make the work his own.My favourite aspect of the film is the intense proportion of skill in the acting from the entire cast of greats. The acting is the most dominant part of the film and you become so absorbed by the characters that you'll forget about the film's two and a half hour running time. Every single actor and actress has a personality and a certain technique to their character which helps you come to understand them better. The enhanced range of styles and wonderful capabilities everyone shows just how much time and effort was put into the film. The cast includes the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio who's performance is in fact the best of his career and also the best the performance the film has to offer, he truly succeeds at holding the film together. You've also got other excellent performances from Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen and the gritty performance from Ray Winstone.Mixing crime and drama perfectly the film sets out to be a modern masterpiece of the cop Vs criminal genre. The technique used to tell the story is brilliant and smoothly paced; it's a distinctive style that has a trademark stamped all over it. The original soundtrack is one that perfect suits the scenes it accompanies and the stark direction captures the crime perfectly. There are many powerful moments to accompany the film and it is at times quite heartfelt. From start to finish you become gripped to the intelligent and intense plot line. There's also a psychological element to the film and moral subtext to the characters, which is terrific.In the end The Departed does become a better film than Infernal Affairs and this owed to the original otherwise The Departed would have been a lost case. One of the best films of the last few years, a must see for anybody interested in film and for the sheer entertainment value this film has to offer.",9,0,0,18 November 2006
Scream," Surprisingly Effective Horror Spoof, Manages To Make A Joke Out Of Every Horror Cliché and Still Remain A Horror
","Over the last decade the painting 'Scream' by Edvard Munch has become better known from the creation of what is now an infamous Halloween mask. The classic image of the white face stretched in a painful scream has become iconic for it's simple and yet un-nerving look. First thing that comes to mind for most people when they think of Scream is the 'ghost face' mask and rightly so, it managed to create one of the perfect horror villains. The fact that throughout the film you never know the evil that is behind the simple mask and it makes it all the more brilliant.I feel guilty saying that I love this movie and yet I still feel I have every right to like it. On first glance I felt I'd been for the typical clichéd teen slasher movie, in which dumb teenagers get picked off one by one and still making sure there are two victims of the ordeal remaining to make room for a sequel. Of course the film does make room for its two-follow ups and still manages to reference another certain Wes Craven originated franchise that became an awful money making machine.The fact that 'Scream' is a horror movie aimed at teens and it still manages to be fun and intelligent. The cast's chemistry is amusing and you can tell everybody had a lot of fun on set. The film's biggest star would be Courtney Cox who plays a highly entertaining and overwhelming character. Drew Barrymore also makes a small role for the infamous opening sequence, one of my favourite scenes. There is a certain moment in the 15-minute scene that stands out for proving the film's sarcastic, twisted and almost guilty comedy level. The moment is one where Drew Barrymore gets put in a tight spot and runs into the kitchen, the cliché joke (in what is actually a very tense scene) is that the kitchen table is empty apart from a box of kitchen knifes. Very sardonic humour, that you'll have to look out for and it certainly is honest in the way it studies the art of making a horror.I've never been a fan of Wes Craven, yet I think Scream proves that he can make a good movie when he puts his mind to it. After watching Scream, I've gained a newfound respect for the horror director. There's a scene in the high school that involves an excellent cameo from the director himself, so keep an eye out. The script is very clumsy, yet it somehow still manages to be perfect for the type of film Scream is. The fact that there is 'rubbish' is Scream, still does not take away the fact it is an excellent film. The characters are likable and memorable which helps you to become involved in the film.The film's pacing is one that keeps you wanting to watch and always tricks you into thinking the killer is someone else and then when the thrilling finale comes to a close you'll certainly feel tricked. The whole last 30 minutes of the film are sure to keep you on the edge of your seat with suspense that even Hitchcock would take note to. The film's references to classic horror movies are certainly impressive and will please all the horror hounds out there. Scream is somewhat a mixture Halloween, but with a slight Carry On edge clinging on. The lighting and the music help create the tension for the crazy and darkly funny death sequences.Avoid Scary Movie which is a painful attempt to rip off the Scream franchise with a spoof attempt (as if they didn't realise Scream was a spoof). If you're looking for a movie that you hope will scare you, then don't watch Scream. But if you want an amusing horror movie, that is from it's roots and still manages to be original then look no further. Perfect to watch with a bunch of friends or just on your own for pure 'sit back' entertainment value. Criminally underrated, don't feel guilty for loving it for what it is.",8,0,1,7 October 2006
Halloween," Hitchcock Would Have Been Proud; A Film That Had A Truly Profound Effect On The Art Of Horror Film-making
","A 1st person shot prowls it's way through an American suburbia, the camera stops on a small house, a house like any other, the front door is opened and a person's hand leans out and grabs a knife from a drawer. The person proceeds to walk up the stairway and picks up a mask From here on in you are introduced to one of the most creepy horrors ever made.It is extremely difficult to define what films are 'pure horror' and why over the last few decades' horror has become a repetitive and most importantly clichéd. Well we can thank Halloween (possibly Psycho or Suspiria) for that because Halloween created the slasher clichés before they became clichés. Halloween is the handbook on how to make the perfect horror film and it has succeeded at being one of the most effective films ever made. There are few films that have managed to terrify so many audiences over the years and gain a wonderful cult following of fans.Halloween changed the face of horror cinema and created some of the greatest screen icons of all time. Dr. Loomis (Donald Pleasence), Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) and most important the masked Michael Myers. This was Jamie Lee Curtis' debut film and it automatically launched her into stardom like her parents. Donald Pleasence the most famous of actors at the time creates one of the best horror heroes of all time and the fact he's different to what you'd expect a hero to be.And then you've got Michael Myers, the horror icon that famously stalks victims in a white, oddly shaped mask similar to that of the later Scream. The fact that the mask is so simple is what makes it so creepy, it's as if it represents an evil energy and one that is un-stoppable. The truth is that all this was created from a Captain Kirk mask turned inside out and that's surely a unique and a genuinely surprising truth.For an independent film that relied on a low budget, it's managed to do a lot more than any 'big buck' Hollywood blockbuster has managed to do. The cheap feel helps create the cold, disturbing, creepy, pallid and un-nerving atmosphere. The uses of Kubrick style tracking shots fit in perfectly and create some of the most memorable pieces of camera work ever put on screen. The film's setting is perfect because it's a town just like any other and that makes it all the more realistic.John Carpenter creates the perfect Hitchcock feel to the film and packed with references from Hitchcock films. The stairways sequence is the ultimate Psycho tribute. The film's use of shadow and the fact that even in the light of the day the terror remains alive. The first 50 minutes of the film are somewhat similar to the style of Strangers On A Train relying on setting up characters, having a hidden evil and general terror that could pop up at any moment. Carpenter is not just a director, but also an excellent musician and with the simplistic brilliance of his score he proves the fact he was a musical prodigy. In fact it remains one of the best scores ever written.John Carpenter has always been one of my favourite directors ever who rarely fails to grab my attention with his unique style of film-making. He puts his love and care into his works and with the attention to detail he is a timeless director of his genre. Carpenter's respect to his favourite films and directors (most famously Howard Hawks) is worthy of approval.Yes it's dated at times and maybe the script isn't as brilliant as it could have been, but Halloween still remains one of the greatest films ever made and one of the most nerve racking films ever made. A masterpiece of its genre, that has stood the test of time and remains just as effective today as it did in '78.",9,1,2,4 November 2006
Paths of Glory," For Those Who Say That Kubrick Couldn't Show Compassion
","With his former directional effort, The Killing, Stanley Kubrick had established his talent as both a storyteller and visionary. In 1957 Kubrick released Paths of Glory, an anti-war film which was instantly banned in France and Spain for its negative portrayal of the military during World War 1. Nevertheless, the director has reportedly claimed that the film is not 'anti-war', but is 'anti-authoritarian ignorance.' While not receiving much attention at the time of its release critical acclaim grew with each passing year and today it is often ranked among 'the greatest films ever made.' Director Steven Spielberg has even stated that it is indefinitely his favourite work from the late icon.When people study Kubrick's filmography in retrospect there is a particular criticism which nearly always rears its ugly head; this being the accusation that Kubrick was incapable of capturing emotion or providing a sense of empathy towards his characters, therefore distancing the viewer. I for one consider Kubrick's detached manner intentionally in context with the nature of his work. Even so, this definitive anti-war outing is far from echoing the cold demeanour of those endless, symmetric corridors in The Shining and yet it still contains the theme of struggling to cope with a greater force.Starring macho action star Kirk Douglas, the film boasts the greatest performance of the actor's lengthy career. It was the performance which developed the foundations of a two-film companionship between actor and director, the latter work being Spartacus. Douglas defied expectations, performing as a disillusioned French unit commander in WW1. His character's idealistic duty is to protect the human rights of three men who have been unjustly accused of cowardice and are consequently facing firing squad execution as an example for those who retreat while in the warzone. Douglas' performance is an acting showcase, displaying the utmost degree of empathy and moral insight.Much of the narrative is spent with Douglas defending the three men facing death. Kubrick's trademark tracking-shot was introduced and utilised to the best extent during the scenes of trench warfare. The technique adds an enclosed, claustrophobic impression of unease. The meticulous manner of direction is directly impressionable and acts as a method of submerging the viewer in a story of delusions, ignorance and more than anything else, arrogance.If you are yet to of seen this film, go and grab yourself a copy right away as you are almost certain to be blown away at the hands of an auteur. Plus, it beats the noticeably dated All Quiet on the Western Front any day, and you are unlikely to find a story with a more benevolent and worthy conclusion.",9,1,2,8 April 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," It Earns Multiple Viewings, As Here Lie Murky Waters
","Director Jonathan Demme's adaptation of Thomas Harris' best-selling novel swept across the globe in 1991, eventually winning five Academy Awards and becoming a prestigious topic of discussion among critics. Its moody influence crept across the popular '90s sub-genre of 'serial-thriller.' This lent The Silence of the Lambs a growing reputation for being an adult thriller (and drama) of horror-like capabilities. The mythically monstrous and deliciously manipulative Hannibal Lecter became an immediate household name, and now remains among the most popular fictitious villains in modern cinema. Such a figure could only be played by one man (has it become unimaginable to picture it any other way?), that man being Anthony Hopkins, who slipped himself into the role with matchless prestige, therefore giving birth to a cultural icon of both literature and cinema.Disturbingly accurate in its portrayal of law enforcement, psychology and crime, The Silence of the Lambs stitches a tight, finely-tuned visage of the criminal psyche. Such a narrative instantaneously drags the viewer into the murky underworld of criminal investigation and dangerously murderous mind games. Jodie Foster performs as Clarice Starling, a trainee FBI agent, with extreme ingenuity and awareness. She is a feminist symbol and a woman rightfully fighting to succeed in the job she so deserves, but because of gender stereotypes she finds herself suffering from sexist reactions. Clarice gets employed by the FBI to question the captured serial-killer and ex-psychiatrist, Dr. Hannibal Lecter. He is believed to hold the key to capturing the uncaught serial-killer, nicknamed Buffalo Bill. Unfortunately for Clarice, Dr. Lecter is not keen on extracting information easily and for personal amusement, manipulates and interrogates Clarice for every ounce of information she receives.One of the most important aspects of Jonathan Demme's seminal thriller is its subjective vision. Much of the camera-work deceitfully places the viewer in the shoes of Clarice, while occasionally reverting to even the killer's perspective of the unfolding events. Yet the key behind the ability to frighten is when one becomes witness to the meticulously considered process Dr. Lecter executes before providing Clarice with the information she so desperately needs. From these scenes we begin to learn that Clarice is suffering from her own inner-torment and childhood anguish. Dr. Lecter is not indirect with his queries, but deviously confrontational, allowing Clarice to unknowingly expose her past to the audience. Many parallels are distinctly demonstrated throughout; an example being Clarice's loss of her parents, in contrast with Buffalo Bill's abusive childhood. The scenes filmed between the two central characters define 'mise-en-scène', a film-making technique used to convey emotion through set design. In this case, the clinical-looking prison ward emphasises a character's isolated, but systematically secured state.The Silence of the Lambs is and always will be an exciting cinematic adventure, not only for its knack of sending sudden bolts of shock through the viewer, but for its admirable talent to tell a story. There are plot holes and clichés littered throughout the surprisingly unpredictable narrative; nevertheless, it will not distract you from being more-than-momentarily immersed over the two-hour running-time. Much of the time is spent periodically conceiving a bundle of well-earned scares, while also allowing time for the audience to ponder the possibilities over what will happen next. Boasting a tremendously taut screenplay, some abrasively framed visuals and a lingering score by composer Howard Shore, this 1991 classic is a treat for film-buffs and casual cinema-goers alike. Even with those brief, glimmering compliments, it is the performances which are showcase material.",7,0,2,17 January 2008
Blade Runner," The 'Director's Cut' Is Both The Intended and Definitive Experience Of *The* Philosophical Tour De Force In Perfection
","Ridley Scott first proved to be a consummate master of cinema with the classic sci-fi horror, Alien and two years prior he had crafted his critically-acclaimed The Duellists. Then in 1982 Ridley Scott returned for his now superlative work, the ground-breaking masterpiece, Blade Runner. It remains one of the most controversial films ever made, due to the range of extensive cuts and edits which were performed by the producers. In 1992 Blade Runner: The Director's Cut was released. This marked a huge accomplishment for both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford who have both cited the original version as 'fake'. Although Ridley Scott considers the Director's Cut to be rushed, it is still the version which he considers true to his original vision and there is no question about it, the Director's Cut is the only way to gain the true representation of the film's colossal greatness.Blade Runner is a vague adaptation of Philip K. Dick's, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and remains a polarising and visionary image of the possible dystopia the world could so easily become. The year 2019 and a 'techno-metro' Los Angeles police-department known as 'Blade Runners' pursue Replicants (genetically-engineered species which are almost indistinguishable from humans). The Replicants are deemed too dangerous for society and are illegal on Earth. Blade Runners are law-enforcement agents set to execute ('retirement') any Replicants which have found their way onto the Earth. Deckard, a retired Blade Runner is unwillingly called back from retirement to pursue four known Replicants who have gained entry into Los Angeles. There is a common misconception that films which have huge budgets and deal with weighty topics are not able to balance both intelligence and entertainment. Except, Blade Runner (although made on a large budget) is far from being a Hollywood film, which is of course a relief because today's Hollywood would rarely dream of letting a film like Blade Runner be crafted in the way it has been. They would want huge explosions, people running in and out of buildings shooting the 'bad guys' and common-placed clichés to please mass-audiences. Commercially, Blade Runner was a failure and views of the film were extremely diverse, this is just one of the reasons why the film has gained a cult success.Blade Runner is a film is so visually stunning that everything about it becomes etched on your mind. The opening shot of a huge dystopia stretching as far as the eye can see, while contrasting against the magnificent lights and colours illuminating the L.A sky is awe-inspiring. As the film progresses you become opened-up to a grim environment where there is little way of differentiating night and day and little way of knowing the time. It is a society overrun with consumerism, technology and most of all menace. It is an overwhelming atmosphere, filmed with grim beauty and visceral flair, an environment where everything is busy, yet people are lonely inside. In a way it is a society where paranoia is quite apparent and nobody is oblivious enough to truly ignore it. The score is another one of the film's many fantastic technical achievements, it perfectly adds to the film's haunting and sombre mood.The retro set-pieces are vibrantly detailed, echoing the shades of techno-noir from the use of camera movements, to other elements such as character personalities, traits and actions. The incorporation of 'femme fatale' is another method used to emphasise the film's shady noir. Then you have the use of symbolism, moralistic undercurrents and the religious imagery (such as the film's significant chess game). In addition, Blade Runner has political (Japanese culture being a strong-hold for American culture) and social subtext (businesses overriding people). You could even go so far as saying the film's main focus is on the individual sorrow of 'what Deckard really is'.Blade Runner is a film whereby the narrative is so involving and relentless that it is impossible not be compelled by the film's infinite selection of material to scrutinise and discuss for hours on end. The acting from the entire cast, notably the performances from that of Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer adds to the film's emotional complexity. Harrison Ford gives the performance of a lifetime; a timeless performance of a man's tortured 'soul'.Blade Runner is a film of thought-provoking ambiguity, conflicting view-points and dramatic emotions. Even on my consistent viewings of Blade Runner I still gain the cold feeling I got the first time when I saw the stunning array of beauty of the film holds, even in the darkest of moments. Ultimately, Blade Runner remains a poignant reminder to how artificial-intelligence could quite possibly become only too 'human' and man's hopeless pursuit for immortality. There is no denying that Blade Runner is one of the finest films ever made and a film deserving repeat-viewings.",10,1,3,7 May 2007
Trainspotting," A Lurid Reality Pumped Through Fantasy. Few Films Can Manage To Be Bleak, Miserable, Tragic and Therefore Depressing While Still Remaining Amusing
","In Britain, during the 90s clubbing was at a high, literally and drug abuse was a regular problem concerning the government. Pop culture was pushing the limits and changing the way many people on the drug scene were used too. The problems were being told through the news, the radio and the newspapers frequently. Then in 1996 an independent British film hit cinema, causing uproar, controversy, worldwide success, critical acclaim and even government mention, this film was called Trainspotting.Trainspotting is based on a novel by Irvine Welsh which charts the life of a bunch of non-existent losers who're living their lives to their 'supposed' full on the Edinburgh drug scene. The film charts the issues of poverty, crime and anti-social behaviour that are still alive in Britain today and shows the horrifying problems of drug abuse that the public-eye attempts to be unaware of. The film exposes the bunch of nasty, yet somewhat hilarious group of stoner's lives and how Renton (Ewan McGregor) attempts to find a true meaning to his chaotic and miserable life.Trainspotting is not a film that will appeal to everyone; it's graphic, nasty and harrowing. Yet, it retains from wanting the viewer to stop watching and manages to hold you throughout the entire running time. A film's content can, in some cases occupy the film's story and make you lose any pity, affection or remorse for the characters. Trainspotting manages to disgust, while still informing the viewers of the problems from drugs.For a film that is so startlingly daring and distressing at times you'd be surprised that it manages to make its point so clear and authoritative. A factor that caused controversy on release was that the film is not afraid to say 'drugs are good at first', but then the film goes on to saying 'but it's not worth it because the side effects will screw you up forever'. It's an excellent message and one that alerts any viewer not to ever go near drugs, yet people have ignored the true meaning of the film which is held within some of the horrific imagery and experiences. If there is one that film that will make you never want to take drugs its Trainspotting. It really will make you think twice and also help you understand why people do such repulsive and then why drug abuse is wrong. Trainspotting is not a film that is preachy, it says you have one life which you should use with care and how you should realise the consequences of your actions. So at heart Trainspotting is an unforgettable and mesmerising study of wasted life. It succeeds in making its viewers come out learning and understanding one of the world's many unpleasant problems.If you didn't see these characters going through such disturbing events the film would not have such a poignant message and one that shows so many devastating outcomes of the drug abuse. Trainspotting has many iconic and memorable characters that're acted out with the utmost sincerity, yet some remain oddly charming. The characters are hysterical at times and for a film full such shameful people you still manage to hold pity for their decaying lives as they spiral into a living hell. The characters are very complex, though at first they seem simple and you gain an indisputable understanding of every character for a film that only lasts 90 minutes. Trainspotting is a film that has been highly influential to cinema as a whole, sparking off many films to come out of the genre and some films even using the same visual delights. For example in Guy Richie's magnificent Snatch, the characters are introduced in a similar way to Trainspotting and this is just to name one of many influences. Danny Boyle is an imaginative director with a brilliant trademark style to accompany his films.A film like Trainspotting is extremely exhausting because of its disturbing and what could have been an unbearable explicit nature. Because the film is at times highly amusing and visually glorious with its matchless ambiguity you'll not want to turn it off, even in the most disgusting moments. Though the film is at times flawed in the plot structure and has a few plot holes, the cinematography washes over the viewer with a somewhat mind-numbing quality. The dialogue is brilliantly paced and laced with pop culture references, studies of British social class and haunting narrative from the almighty, career-launching performance by Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting's soundtrack is another high-point and remains entertaining, quirky and also flawlessly fitting to the scenes it accompanies.It's a film that truly lays bare the problems of youth and drugs, showing the genuine effects with the needed explicitly and yet remaining solid entertainment from the comedy factor. A true gem of British, 90s cinema which unflinchingly depicts the lives of the no-lives in their cruel and deceitful worlds they've climbed into. Trainspotting has heart and works as an educational roller-coaster of pure realism that still shocks and teaches viewers the horrific affects of drug abuse. Trainspotting is a film that will never leave you which is ironic considering it's about addiction and affliction. Trainspotting is a film that terrifies me and should succeed in making anyone want to keep clean. We all know drug abuse is awful, but Trainspotting succeeds in showing its viewers why.",8,0,1,28 December 2006
The Deer Hunter," The Definitive Anti-War Statement Told Through Life-Affirming Drama; Showing How War Is A Cruel and Deceiving World Covered Up By Medals and Media Glamorisation
","War has always been a touchy subject in cinema and one that has been show through different parallels throughout the history of film. Some films have glamorised or justified it, some have been an exercise in propaganda, others have been strong anti-war statements and some have just told a story with all the facts. As a genre the same tales have been told over and over, yet what has made seeing the same story different is the fact that you're usually seeing the film through a perspective of the events.The story of The Deer Hunter is a straightforward one that revolves around a group of close-knitted friends living together in an industrial town. You'll be revealed people's love, secrets, desires and frustrations with life, all this helps to characterise the film. The story shows the life cycle of the years before and after Vietnam, ultimately showing the psychological affects of the war through cold drama.The Deer Hunter is a film that for the first seventy-five minutes builds up the dramatic experience, it's a cinematic device used to help you understand the characters and their lives. In some way it's a trick because it makes you like (and for some dislike) the characters before they're plunged into the living hell of Vietnam causing extreme devastation to their lives forever. Even though the first part of the film has been deceived as 'slow' or 'laborious', I consider it a highly important aspect of the film as it helps us understand the natural reality of the character's lives before they're plunged into the war-zone. At closer look you'll notice that during this first half of the film there is a somewhat premonition of the future events that will unfold. This is all shown through a series of metaphors, scattered cunningly throughout the first half's series of events.Because the film's characters are ones who make their living through backbreaking industrialist work they consider the opportunity of war a new hope for them. This is showing how the US government prayed on people who were grief-stricken and usually not very well off to join the army. For a film that caused questionable controversy on release from war veterans and the Vietnamese. It managed to still defy audiences with the legitimate outcry of America's isolation after Vietnam and then took away 5 Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. There has always been the added controversy about the film's supposed 'gay undertones' which are slyly hinted and yet not proved with any justifiable evidence.The film uses very interesting techniques to help us understand the characters; they're generally people we can all relate to. All the flaws in human characteristics are there because we all have our problems and characters such as Stanley (wonderfully performed by John Cazale) help us realise that we can all be overwhelmed by arrogance at times. By the end of the film you'll understand that the power of true friendship is the basis of human nature, it sums up how people can stick together in even the darkest moments of existence. It's a 'dog-eat-dog' world and that life is not always beautiful. The crisis of vulnerability gained during war can be alleged only by the men who survive it and when you faced with a genuine life-and-death situation only then do you really understand life. These are just some of the many examples that are detailed through The Deer Hunter.The film's cinematography captures the spirit of natural beauty, the dirty industrial suburban town and the repulsion of the war-zone. These are all places that were nature, but were destroyed through industrialisation and the violence from war. The only place that remains the dreamlike getaway for the film's characters are the North American mountains and the glorious amount of nature and wildlife surrounding the area. The stunning glimpses of the gloomy weather clouding over America's mountains and the shots of the rivers glimmering underneath, these are shots to adore showing the joy of the photographic eye. The film rarely moves away from its foggy and overcast weather helping to set the 'polluted' mood the film embraces. The clean-cut editing is very smooth and polished to the finest grain. The score is musical perfection and that recognised and hauntingly striking guitar work is admirable.The acting is magnificent and you'll surely notice performances develop. Character's emotions and features become beautifully apparent as the film gradually moves along. Robert De Niro gives a career defining performance that has been unmatched in the emotional power and the philosophical subtext his character claims. John Savage gives a shy and overpowering performance bursting with intensity and with heart-wrenching accuracy of a human reaction. Christopher Walken gives the film's defining performance and the greatest touch, he's a character you will be instantly be fond of for his great sense of human and likable personality. And finally you have that riveting and disheartening performance from Meryl Streep.Michael Cimino, famous for being a one-hit-wonder of cinema never managed to regain the level of exquisite direction The Deer Hunter holds and after all the critical acclaim The Deer Hunter has been given over the years he never managed to live up to hype that was expected after the film. Thankfully Michael Cimino managed to create one of the most important samples of American cinema that deserves all recognition and the must-see acclaim it has gathered.To truly appreciate a film like The Deer Hunter it needs repeat viewings as you'll find new messages, meaning, morals and observations. Without a doubt a life-affirming piece of cinema that captures the singular beauty of the innocence in the average man and how it can be taken away through the atrocities of what adds up to 'meaningless violence'. Cinema is rarely this flawless in capturing the essence of life with such remorse beauty. It's tragedy through brilliance.",7,1,2,19 December 2006
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Whacky, Creepy, Entertaining and Amusing; A Highlight In Definitive Horror Cinema
","Looking back at the world of film in the '80s you will notice that overall it was a fairly disastrous and disappointing time for cinema. It was a time where focus was spent on money, fame and fortune, rather than talent and a decade that introduced the rise of the sequel. It was also a very popular decade for horror films, particularly slasher films and yet there are very few exceptional horror achievements from the '80s. I've never been too fond of horror as a genre. I find it a clichéd and unproductive genre; although it is a genre that has so much going for it and when done accurately you might be lucky enough to have the pleasure a skin-crawling masterpiece. You see, horror needs imagination and originality to work; it has to blend genre elements together to craft something genuinely unique. Horror is a genre that has so much to offer. Alas, it is a sad fact when you acknowledge just how little is accomplished due to focus on spawning money-laundering, gore-filled sequels. Yet, there is something so appealing about Wes Craven's triumphant '80s classicA Nightmare on Elm Street is crafted around the now infamous 'bogeyman' story, which has become somewhat globalising by marketing sequels and Halloween costumes. The film follows the story of a group of suburban American teens who are being stalked in their dreams by a murdered, superficial serial-killer named Freddy Krueger. So the teens decide to fight against the creature inside their dreams. The film is centred on a heroine (a popular Wes Craven trend, e.g. Scream) and oddly reminisces specific elements of John Carpenter's masterpiece Halloween. A Nightmare on Elm Street undoubtedly has its flaws, although these are flaws that are disguised by some of the truly brilliant factors that the film holds. Yes, it has become somewhat dated, yes, the young actors/actresses hold nothing special performance wise, yes, the film is at times cheesy and yes the script is extremely bland. But when you have the brilliance of a film where the editing manages to create a parallel universe, thereby the dimension of reality and dream-state are fused together (the viewer notes the film's dimension through subtleties in the direction) creating a horribly surreal and literal nightmare. A Nightmare on Elm Street is extremely intelligent in the way it wants to attack your sub-conscious. This is another method at creating a lasting fear for viewers unnerved by the actual viewing of the film and rather will be thinking about it when they are ready to fall asleep. Fact is, everyone can relate to A Nightmare on Elm Street due to the fact that everybody has had nightmares and this is the reason for it being considered (for some) a terrifying film.Filmed on a low-budget and using a mixture of dizzying camera techniques A Nightmare on Elm Street does not stop at being unique. The use of a few set-pieces and masterful props are perfect at creating the atmosphere for a horror film. There is a strong use of poignant lighting and shadow techniques scattered throughout the film. These take wonderful focus on the grotesque make-up for the iconic villain Freddy Krueger. Wes Craven uses sly editing processes and music to delve inside the film's story. The narrative has been paced at a steady speed, never feeling rushed and unnecessary meaning that you are inside the tension throughout the entire running-time. There is an amusing touch of dark comedy littered throughout the film, primarily gained from Krueger's insane antics. It really is a shame that Hollywood is obsessed with making unnecessary sequels to solid films which get away with unexpected climaxes and open endings. The American film industry seems to be obsessed by the idea of having everything wrapped up in a tight package for today's audiences. If you want a highly entertaining, influential, iconic and productive horror film then look no further than A Nightmare on Elm Street. It remains fantasy horror at the top of its game and a respectful ode to '80s cinema.",7,7,9,10 March 2007
Ran," Kurosawa's Final Masterpiece Is A Godsend
","There it was. My second viewing of Ran, and the one which made me acknowledge just how much of an auteur Akira Kurosawa was. I have seen numerous films from the director and literally all of them are essential viewing, yet one of those particular essentials is undoubtedly the director's concluding, 1985 epic. Set on the foundations of William Shakespeare's King Lear and produced on a remarkably large by Japanese standards at the time- $12 million budget, Ran draws corresponding angles between ancient Japanese history and the classic literacy theme of tyranny.Kurosawa's inspiration for the picture is as follows; 'when I read that three arrows together are invincible, that's not true. I started doubting, and that's when I started thinking: the house was prosperous and the sons were courageous. What if this fascinating man had bad sons?' Those words describe the general premise of Ran, not just the beginning idea, but the focal-point. Also, the King Lear insight was something which fascinated Kurosawa, as he had always wanted to create a past for the characters in his version of the tale (something he similarly did with Throne of Blood).Beginning with an extended scene set against the expansive and luscious background of Mount Aso -during the historic period of Feudal Japan- and ending in full-scale war. This contrast depicts how easily broken a 'peace' can be, and the escalating tension slowly builds until the land's ageing Great Lord flees his own land to avoid his children's bitter quarrelling. Almost all the characters in the film are after some sort of power; the Lord recognises the yearning his own family have to take the land from him and expresses his disgust towards their selfishness, gluttony, deceptiveness and disrespectful nature. Yet the youngest son observes the evil taking place and attempts to rescue his father from the wrath of his deceitful brothers. Keep in mind; this is based on a Shakespearian tale, so tragedy is always inevitable.Ever since its release, Ran has garnered practically 100% unanimous praise and is often denounced as a modern masterpiece, along with the previous and far less polished work, Kagemusha (Kurosawa called it 'a dress rehearsal for Ran'). There is something about the to-be classic which for me personally- offers more satisfaction than any other picture by the Japanese auteur. Many would argue that the film is not as entertaining as Kurosawa's '50s and '60s outings, such as Yojimbo and Seven Samurai, but I would disagree, as much as I adore such classics. In retrospect, nearly every finished Kurosawa product was and continues to remain a great film, if not a masterpiece. Only a collected minority of directors have ever held such unmatched stability.The symbolic use of individually coloured clothing accentuates the emotions of each character; primary colours, yellow, red, blue and white are worn by the principal characters at the start of the piece. Heavy weight is pressed on conveying four predominant and reoccurring themes; turmoil, age, nihilism and warfare. The violence obviously existed throughout the Lord's reign, as an increased inner thirst (predominantly from his children) for control had been looming over the elderly Lord each day he grew older. Kurosawa is said to of intentionally made the chaos displayed a metaphor for an apocalypse of modern nuclear warfare. Well, it sure works.More than anything else, Kurosawa proved his ability to craft films which were in touch with contemporary cinema, but still included all the elements which develop a classic. Without hesitation I would cite Ran as the film which employs the finest use of long-shot cinematography. This is a mere sampling of my feelings towards the technicalities, let alone the film as a whole. Eruptions of unqualified chaos have never been so intoxicating.",10,3,7,24 December 2007
The Thin Red Line," Dancing with death and the thin line that divides you from it
","The camera slowly moves through the long grass, you can see the tips of the mountains in the distance, the sun reflects down over the solders as they pass through the undergrowth. Setting the scene for The Thin Red Line. The solders are dancing with death. Every single scene captures the moment with perfection and precision. The Thin Red Line says so much through silence or music because it is expertly crafted. This is the definition of art and an example of a contemporary war film. The image of the tiny slash of blood on the moving grass is a very haunting one, that will always stick with me. And I can't forget the baby bird hatching underneath all the furious rage and hatred surrounding it. This gives the impression of peace fighting against the dying. The introduction is one of the best ever, the slow paced narration and the bright colours of the children swimming while the score plays asking you questions about immortality. A poetic vision of war, unsurpassed beauty and questions of belief. And also the study of obsession...The weather seems to suit the mood and fit in perfectly with the scene, an example would be the orange clouds passing over the mountains. One frame expresses everything that a character is feeling. You can see it through their eyes and their physical actions/expressions. An example of using acting as an art and the cast is amazing and filled with such great variety. The men are all different and all have different views and ways of dealing with a situation. The sweat sits on the solder's faces as they rock back and forward getting ready for a battle. The film has the elements of hide and seek as the men crouch along the ground with the fast whizzing sound of bullets buzzing over their heads and men screaming. You feel the strain, the stress, the anger that the solders are going through and the fear of dying alone. All this makes the movie so powerful and moving. The whole film feels tense, edge of your seat nail biting genius. I love the shots of the spraying light filtering out through the trees while men have the horror of waiting to die. The vast array of actors (everybody perfectly casted) in the movie all put on powerful and believable roles. I love the use of mist in the film to create atmosphere and the close up shots on the solder's horror stricken faces. Some of the most thrilling sequences and one of the most harrowing films ever made. The editing is another point that stands out to me, it is all precise and fits in perfectly at the right moments in time just like the score.Terrence Malik has established himself as a cult director; he makes films years and years after the previous. Though The Thin Red Line seems as though ages was spent preparing for it. Terrence Malik loves movies and knows all the techniques you can really see this when watching his films. He manages to capture the realism of war, the strategic combat of military. One of the main outstanding point of the movie is the way you never see the enemies faces or at least not clearly till that latter part of the movie. Possibly the most realistic war experience ever, apart from Saving Private Ryan. But whereas Saving Private Ryan is a brutally honest interpretation, The Thin Red Line is philosophical. Both are masterpieces no doubt about it. The personal director's message is an anti-war statement that will ring and out and haunt you till the credits close. You see the terrible evil things solders have to do during war in an un flinching perspective. The attention to the detail is astounding, the focus on animals in their natural habitats as well as the beautiful settings. Voice over, 1st person camera shots, beautiful imagery, stunning photography, amazing direction and a moving score make this a true masterpiece. A film that asks the viewer questions and morals of life at war, should you do what you think is right for your fellow men or do what your commander says? You see there are many ethical questions filtered with powerful mind numbing scenes that grab the viewer. The Thin Red Line is definitely not for the average viewer or someone who just expects lots of action, it's a thinking persons war movie rather like Apocalypse Now is.",9,2,5,9 June 2006
Atonement," A Rare Cinematic Showcase, Offering A Vast Array Of Engaging Talent
","2007 has been a slow year up until now; at least, I have been unimpressed by practically every release of the year so far. Hence, my uncertainty of whether I should let my expectations rise for the opening of Atonement. Instead, I decided to go in without listening to the hype. I came out of the cinema exhausted, yet it was a good kind of exhaustion, the kind of exhaustion found after an emotionally draining experience which actually succeeded in moving the viewer. Atonement has Best Picture material written all over it, and at this current stage I sincerely doubt that I will find any 2007 film to surpass it.Adapted from the novel of war veteran Ian McEwan, Atonement is directed by young British talent, Joe Wright. Weaving a convoluted, sometimes fascinatingly dreamlike story of unforgiving love in WW2 Britain, Atonement centres on a rich family torn apart by a terrible crime and a love that could never be. Centring itself on three key characters; the young Briony Tallis (played by Saoirse Ronan), her elder sister, Cecilia Tallis (Keira Knightley) and their housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner (James McAvoy), from here on the film depicts the misinterpreted relationship drawn between Cecilia and Robbie. The film conducts a web of disillusionment and regret.For me, the finest element of Atonement is the editing, which is some of the most subtly detailed of recent years. It is the type of fresh editing which enables the viewer to realise how even more alluringly intelligent the picture is. For example, the moment where it cuts from Keira Knightley diving, to James McAvoy bringing himself up from under the bathwater. There are numerous other moments to name, such as the 'cigarettes and opera' sequence or the lavishly romantic sex scene. Everything fits together with a non-superficial ease, providing a sense of far more thoughtful film-making. Having the pressing typewriter beats playing against a person's hurried walk is another notable case of sound editing; it should be noted because it helps the atmosphere have an additional level of unavoidable allure. You just cannot refuse to ignore the adaptable use of stylistically-enhancing editing. Cinematography also plays a huge part in the picture, too. Rather than simply relying on a clean-cut narrative and some noteworthy performance, the film makes an effort to employ all the features which start to create real cinema. The five-minute long tracking-shot found when the troops enter Dunkirk left me in awe, conveying the destruction through its confrontational set-pieces.Nevertheless, the acting is yet another one of the film's triumphant endeavours. Being that the director's vision and the actor's insights are fused together with an undeniable awareness, meaning the film is at liberty to take a consistently smooth pace. The camera seems to pick up every detail the performers exert, e.g. the recurring use of hand/eye gestures to echo the feelings found within awkward or crucial moments. Evidently, a lot of time was spent rehearsing the magnificent screenplay, since all the actors deliver their lines with a secured knowledge, but without the viewer feeling as though anything was overly rehearsed. Even Keria Knightley left me stupefied, considering I have become exempt to seeing her provide wooden performances which offer nothing what-so-ever for a film. Yet, she is quite sublime in Atonement, exemplifying the features of an upperclass woman. Proving that she can tackle mature roles meant I felt pleased to see a genuinely positive performance from the ever-growing star. James McVoy is by far the film's overall star, though.Not only is Atonement a romance, it is a war film and drama, too. I admit that I expected the film to be the generic sentimental tweaking on a period-piece/costume-drama premise. To my great surprise I was blown away, stunned by the dynamic personalities which were being portrayed on-screen and left in a daze over the luscious visuals. Essentially, Atonement is a romance, and I would be ignorant to deny it. Nonetheless, I found it to be much more than a 'romance', but in fact a lyrical journey of culpability.",7,5,11,8 September 2007
V for Vendetta," Feels Like A Missed Opportunity, That's Only 40% Completed
","With all the hype leading up to V For Vendetta and myself being one of the followers I was looking forward to seeing V For Vendetta. V For Vendetta had mixed reviews on release and even many of the cult followers of the original comic book series felt cheated. The people who actually liked V For Vendetta most are the people who seemed to have not been following all the press up to release.Not only is V For Vendetta a film that lacks a back-story to the film's main premise, it also lacks any kind of resolution. You'd never know that Hugo Weaving is the man under the mask because that's basically all he is throughout the film. Yet he creates a certain mystery to the already iconic 'Guy Fawke's mask' becoming what is a somewhat intelligent terrorist, there seems no reason behind his odd attempt to over through the government and yet he still remains an interesting character even when he just rhymes descriptive words. All sounds a little strange I guess? Well it is and throughout the entire film I found myself wondering if the movie could become even more over dramatic, over acted and yes sadly extremely over the top.V For Vendetta is filmed through a very strange visual style and one that at first I found very hard to get my head round. The bright colours and vivid fantasy look was one that I personally am not a fan of. I'm not quite sure if V For Vendetta was attempting to be realistic at showing a future where the government provoke fear into the hearts of every human being. V For Vendetta gives a vibe of 'I hate everything to do with our governments' which I personally feel is a very generalised and over used concept.The film's story and entertainment are the only things that keep the film together, even the acting from John Hurt is disappointing (If you can call it acting) and Hugo Weaving is not even acting he's just proving he's got a voice talent. Natalie Portman also disappoints with a bland role where the emotion feels very fake. The film has gigantic pacing problems and the end feels very abrupt, as well as ridiculous.I don't recommend V For Vendetta, as it is often dull and over the top. To think that the film was created by the minds that warped The Matrix makes the film all the more disappointing. No way does it live up to the masterpiece that is The Matrix and V For Vendetta in the end achieves next to nothing. A contrived and messy waltz of nonsense.",2,3,6,16 September 2006
The Godfather," The Magnitude Of 'The Godfather' Achieves In Assisting One's Love Of Film To Grow Beyond All Measure
","The majority of critics will cite the definitive 'greatest film of all-time' as Citizen Kane, but other films are regularly mentioned in conjunction, one of those being The Godfather. Many argue it is the finest example of such a medium. Both The Godfather and The Godfather: Part II won Best Picture in the years of 1972 and 1974. The films spawned continuously growing numbers of so-called 'gangster flicks', most of them not having the same delicate, operatic beauty of Francis Ford Coppola's classic. At present, and forever more, the film will consistently rank among the most flawless; perfectly illustrating an era when American cinema really was at the top of its game.Charting the rise and fall of a ruthless family of high-class society members who have made their fortune through crime, The Godfather remains a story which enthrals and grasps the imagination of viewers from all generations. It is an essay of violence; nevertheless, some accuse the film of being a study of family, rather than of gangsters. Being that, technically speaking, the film uses 'gangsterism' as a means of driving the film's key motifs, such as that of dedication and reliance to one's family. Kicking off with the wedding sequence the film details an Italian-American family's ascent into an intensifying success (and failure) through organised crime. After returning from the war, a reluctant Michael Corleone (played by Al Pacino) makes his best attempts at distancing himself from his Mafia ties. Unlike the rest of his brothers, he feels obliged to live a fruitful life as a law-abiding citizen, but due to obligations and regard for his family he soon becomes more inclined to 'join the family' because of a number of pressing commitment and loyalty issues.Arguably, the theme of 'violence breeding violence' is one which has been wildly overdone throughout cinema history. Yet The Godfather is a work which uses the theme to the best of its extent. The depiction of cold-blooded brutality within the picture has not lost any of its raw and painful pragmatism. Indeed, it is the 'matter-of-fact' nature of the film which makes it unquestionably powerful. Since the violence portrayed is not particularly graphic, but presented in a way which strikes the viewer due to the what seems like- prolonged nature of the appearance. Essentially, much of The Godfather oozes a sense of unequalled menace, not due to the violence, but the scale of operatic themes conveyed through such an awe-inspiring sensation of film-making splendour.Every element participates in creating the finished version of a film, and The Godfather is a primary instance of even the most intricate details being perfected to a point of enabling the film to become entirely flawless. The masterpiece provides viewers with performances which remain unmatched in their scope, and rank among a league of their own. How the performers utilise their characters, while serving as a means of polishing the film is truly exceptional. Renowned actors, such as Marlon Brando, James Caan and Robert Duvall offer performances of such inconspicuous allure that they soon become almost unrecognisable from that of their character. To detail the performances would take a lifetime, being that there is such a considerable amount of material to analysis within career-defining performances, which offer more and more with each and every viewing. The performances are deliberately faultless so as to be valued and studied as each year goes by.The legendary and widely celebrated baptism scene coveys editing in a manner unlike practically anything made prior and following the film. A sequence crafted on an acrimonious feeling of guilt; permitting the work to become even more emotionally engaging and terrifying in its momentum. Cutting from the 'false' commitment of Catholic oath, to the hiring of vicious contract killings it conveys the deepest feeling of tentative regret and unholy guilt. Gordon Willis' foreboding cinematography is a genuine accomplishment of epic proportions. The cinematography is the kind which has evidently stood the test of time, letting viewers relish the profound and unique aura of the elegantly gracious camera work through long, ominous takes and fragile pull-backs. It is of such sophistication that The Godfather compels its viewers to feel the impression of being in the company of an auteur. Next up is the score, remaining one of the crucial tones to the picture. Composed by Nino Rota, the score enhances the emotive style that the film follows throughout the duration.I have been watching The Godfather for many years now and it remains one of my unquestionably favourite films. Cinema has endured decades of revolution since The Godfather was first released, but The Godfather still stands tall above nearly all the gangster films which have followed in pursuit. A gangster predecessor which is slightly greater than that of The Godfather is Martin Scorsese's Goodfellas; nevertheless, that is still a debatable opinion of my own. I cannot begin to stress just how deserving The Godfather is of its appreciation, since it is a film which is deservedly identified and credited as a slice of perfection. To think that in 1979 Francis Ford Coppola released a film more superior than The Godfather (the film being Apocalypse Now); I believe this unmistakably puts his auteur status into glaring perspective. All this is much more than a fleeting glimpse of cinematic heaven, considering the viewer becomes just like one of the characters, a controlled puppet for a game, which -in the case of the film- does not manipulate, but engages.",10,1,3,14 August 2007
