Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The biggest disappointment ever
","If you were a Star Wars fan growing up, you probably lived hoping you would get another movie after Return of the Jedi. You probably saved all your money doing chores to buy action figures. You probably were in love with it for a long time and kept it as a stepping stone of your childhood. So 15 years later when Lucas finally decided to do another movie, you felt thrilled, and excited.Never will something be so wildly anticipated or a bigger disappointment. So many things wrong with this movie, it's hard to start, but I guess I will start with the opening.The film opens with a pilot asking for permission to land in some ship. No explanation what so ever about anything going on. Then we see the two cloaked figures walk in and want to talk about a trade dispute.It only gets worse as time progresses. There is NO clear main character at all in this movie. Unlike the original trilogy, we at least knew Luke was the protagonist. In Phantom Menace we know nothing.Plot holes everywhere, such as the whole blockade around this planet. It's over space taxes, and they mention that people are 'dying' on Naboo yet we never see a single corpse anywhere. What were they dying from? What was the blockade about to begin with? So many things left unexplained, and many wooden characters. I think Ewan McGregor is a fine actor, and I don't really put all the blame on the actors. When you're being filmed in front of a blue screen it's going to be bad. So can't really put all the blame on the actors here.As a huge fan of the original Star Wars. The newer films were a huge disappointment, and lacked a plot, main character, and many elements that make good film making.",1,4,8,3 September 2011
