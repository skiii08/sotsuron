The Rock," BEST.MOVIE.EVER.
","Ultimately, my favorite movie of all time. Yes, it is ridiculously stupid and reeks of the 90s, but I don't care. There are so many awesome actors littered all over this masterpiece and an insane amount of hilariously quotable lines. I think I own every possible edition of the DVD and Blu-Ray and am not ashamed to admit that.",10,1,2,6 March 2019
Captain Corelli's Mandolin," Legitimately ashamed that I bought this
","This movie should be burned at the stake along with anyone who claims they actually like it. You'd think a team of Nic Cage and Penelope Cruz could be amazing, but the only thing amazing about it is how amazingly bad it is. All mandolins around the world cry whenever anyone watches this movie. It doesn't help that it feels like it's 5 hours long. I give one extra star because I'd like to believe that deep down in the jumbled recesses of his coke-fueled mind, Cage actually thought his character WAS the mandolin.",2,0,0,6 March 2019
Non-Stop," Liam Neeson's action career is non-stop....and I love it
","This is pretty much what we've come to expect from Liam Neeson these days - a gruff, jaded, middle-aged man with a colored past is begrudgingly thrown into a catastrophic situation in which he can trust no one, and he must transform into the gritty action hero that we have all come to know and love. I seriously never tire of watching Liam Neeson in these roles (I get unabashedly giddy every time a new 'Taken' is announced), and he certainly does not disappoint in 'Non-Stop.' The writers did an amazing job with a story in which you are constantly questioning who the actual villain is, which at more than one point they lead you to believe might even be Neeson himself, and you can never quite shake that shadow of doubt.The supporting cast is just as much a part of this movie's appeal, with Julianne Moore (as her usual charming self), Michelle Dockery, and Corey Stoll sporadically muscling their way to the forefront, all the while casting doubt on their own motives. My only strike against it (and it might just be my mood today, because it's not a make-or-break kind of complaint) is that it doesn't truly reach a climax of epic proportions like it seems to build up to - but that's understandable because the entire movie takes place inside an airplane, so you can't exactly build up much larger than that. All in all, though, a very enjoyable little action flick, a nice way to spend a Saturday evening.",8,2,3,6 March 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Twice the Amount of Un-Amazingness
","Dear lord this was just one painful minute after another. The only truly redeeming part of this haphazard sequel was the casting of Jamie Foxx as Electro. His performance is stellar amidst (and in spite of) the drudging script and an ensemble of cringe-worthy performances from the rest of the cast. But that's really all it has going for it. The graphics aren't much better or any more believable than the first 'Amazing Spiderman' of which this is based. I appreciated the overall plot line somewhat, but not enough to suggest that anyone else subject themselves to the 2+ hours of torture. This movie, in fact, isn't even good enough to have playing in the background while you are working on something else and aren't even paying attention to it. I actually would like to keep writing about how bad this movie really is, but I keep getting more and more worked up as I go along, and I'm afraid I might blow a fuse in my brain if I get bent out of shape any further. Moral of the story: Amazing Spider-Man 2: Twice the amount of Un-Amazingness.",2,0,4,6 March 2019
The Happening," I'm still not sure what's happening
","It is truly comical just how terrible this movie is. I mean it is so laughably bad that I have to give it an extra star just for how hard I was laughing at some points. I have now seen more of the inside of Mark Wahlberg's mouth than I ever care to see again. And the only reason I would ever, ever, ever watch this again (or suggest it to anyone, even someone I hate a great deal) is if there were copious amounts of alcohol involved. And even then, I'm pretty sure I would spend most of the movie thinking about other, more worthwhile, things that I could be doing instead of watching 'The Happening' and wasting all that delicious alcohol.",3,0,1,6 March 2019
Lord of War," 100% behind this gem
","Ultimately a super depressing and downer of a movie when you really think about it, but god it is SO GOOD. Jared Leto is amazing and Nic Cage is perfect for his role as an international gun runner. Phenomenal cast overall, really cool (but disturbing) story, and never a dull moment. 100% behind this gem.",10,0,0,6 March 2019
The Cabin in the Woods," So much awesome, where do I even begin?
","It's been said (by some fairly reliable and scholarly sources) that if you watch 'The Shining' as a parody of the horror genre, it's an uproariously funny movie. Personally, I've never been able to lift myself out of Kubrik's stunningly horrific classic to see the humor, and I'm not sure I really want to taint the perfection I've always perceived from that masterpiece.With 'Cabin in the Woods,' I can have my cake and eat it too. Not only are there plenty of great scares to appease the horror masses, not to mention enough supernatural spooks to stock your nightmares for the next several years and blood and gore galore, but the entire movie is one epic satire of everything horror. One minute you're white knuckled and trying not to pee your pants, the next you're laughing so hard that you run an even higher risk of peeing your pants.It's a smart and funny, captivating and terrifying, and with a plot trajectory that totally blindsides you. This is always on my list of annual Halloween favorites, nestled right next to 'The Shining,' right where it belongs.",9,2,3,6 March 2019
