Hereditary," Totally Disappointed
","In no particular order why I really didn't like this film:
1) Toni Collette's over acting. Not quite as bad as Julianne Moore or Holly Hunter but still way OTT
2) The character of the father being just totally unbelievable. Surely if you suspect your wife is going mad, wouldn't you want to support her and oblige her seemingly trivial requests rather than pointlessly say no.
3) The predictable 'horror movie' soundtrack. Yawn.
4) And it was just too slow, slow, slow. At no stage whatsoever did I feel the slighest bit scared, anxious or terrorfied. Mostly I was just out and out bored!",2,5,10,16 June 2018
