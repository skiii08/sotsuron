The Blair Witch Project," and to think, I had to pay for it twice.
","This movie was horrible. It really made me apreciate these over paid actors. atleast if they had got them they could have done a better job of not trying to act. Can't remember what friend told me it was good but if I could Id make him give me my money back. The movie concept was unique, but lacked in delivery and so much more. The filming was terrible. and I really thought the end sucked. all in all I gave it a 1.125 out of 10 mainly because they was a cute chick sitting in front of me. maybe I just think it sucked so bad because I was starring at the back of this checks head most of it? Who knows. Dont waste your time. Go see something else.",Null,0,0,22 August 1999
