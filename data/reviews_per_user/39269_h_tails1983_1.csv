Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Well worth the wait
","Ive been asking myself ever since I saw the Star Wars trilogy, why does it start with 4 and not 1? That started 13 years ago when I was 4. Well, Im glad they did it that way because Episode 1 was absolutely fabulous!!! The effects were brilliants, the plot was in a brill Star Wars and the actors really did well. The Jedi moves were even better than in the first trilogy. I cant wait til ep. 2 and 3!!!",Null,0,0,6 September 2000
