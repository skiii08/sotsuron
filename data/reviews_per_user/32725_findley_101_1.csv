Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill II compliments the first one *potential spoiler*
","Kill Bill Volume One explores the journey of The Bride (Uma Thurman) as she attempts to avenge the massacre of her wedding which left her with a gun shot wound in the head resulting in a coma, and evidently killed her unborn child.Volume two compliments the first by incorporating the familiar aspects of Clint Eastwood style westerns and classic Asian Kung Foo movies, as well as introducing a more cultivated atmosphere that is a welcome, though not necceserly 'better', change to Volume I through clever dialogue and more impressionable action scenes.Tarantino uses clever filming techniques that really bring the audience in to the picture, the 'grave break', a scene in which the Bride is buried alive in a coffin, really stands out as a scene that transferes the claustrophobic sensation from the screen to the cinema, and the audience. A fantastic soundtrack ties in perfectly with this fantastic sequel.Kill Bill Volume II does what it intends to do and does it well, the end a fitting finale for this fantastic duo, a tribute to classy director, Quentin Tarantino.",Null,0,1,27 April 2004
