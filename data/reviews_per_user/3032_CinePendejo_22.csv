Blade Runner 2049," Beautiful and faithful, even if a bit far-reaching
","The original Blade Runner is one of those films that left me cold at first but got progressively better the more I watch. It had a very dreamlike ambiguity that fit well to its futuristic noir setting but needed more dissecting to fully appreciate. Considering the many cuts that it had, director Ridley Scott couldn't muster with what he had either. It wasn't until the then-unsuccessful movie got a final cut that Scott found the soft balance between artistic dreamscape and science fiction in the film, which ultimately was declared a classic upon many film nerds. It was purely a unique and meditative experience which, like 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, told a complete story that questions our sense of reality and how far can we as man can reach beyond it.The new sequel, BLADE RUNNER 2049, with ARRIVAL and SICARIO director Denis Villeneuve, aims to both expand and pay faithful attention to the original film and what it stood for. Updating the scenes while blending with the original, expanding the philosophies of our existence and our persistence to recreate it, continuing the story of Rick Decker rather than rehashing it, and even mostly replicating the Vangelis score. Its bold, far-reaching, and tightly restrictive sequel filmmaking, one that Hollywood cinema seriously needs considering the franchise-sequel-remake dreck we are forced to live in. Even though there are some elements that overreach its grasp, it mostly gets the job done as a worthy successor.One thing it does right is get right down to humanizing the replicants. Now centered around Ryan Gosling as a replicant hunting other replicants, the film puts him on center as a guide to the films themes about how these beings cope with reality. Some small replicant details from the original get blossomed here, as they cope with their love, anger, memories, nostalgia, and the quest to find existence. The key difference is that it puts the themes to expand and even humanize the life of a replicant rather than leaving them illusive. We get brilliant techno ways in which our titular character finds love, identifies memories, copes with his existence, and ultimately comes to term with it. The whole subplot alone with Gosling and his robot love interest (Yeah yeah put HER joke in here) makes for easily the most emotionally resonant moments in the film. Its a film that fully branches from the foundation of the original in ways other sci-fi films in the past decade failed miserably on their own.The sole caveat, however, is that it sacrifices the one key ingredient from the film; subtle poetry. Whereas the original felt ambiguous and transcendent in exploring our humanity, 2049 could not help but feel too modernized and accessible. The bloated run time, sudden swell of percussion of the score, fairly streamlined plot, expository dialogue up the wazoo, and a little too much of slow pace made it clear that the overall film could try so much while also keeping a modern blockbuster aesthetic. Much like the replicants, 2049 could only go so far for achieving the real thing.Still it doesn't mean it totally falls apart. Even if the films ambitious reach is only as good as its grasp, the movie does have one hell of a reach. The set pieces are amazing, the small amount of action scenes puts me on edge, the acting from Gosling, Ford, Robin Wright, Ana De Armas and even freaking Jared Leto was phenomenal, and the story pays off relatively well. May not be the masterpiece everyone else says it is, but I'd be glad Hollywood takes notes from this rather than from JURASSIC WORLD, AVENGERS, or another STAR WARS spin off.Definitely worth your time.More reviews: https://letterboxd.com/Itachisan125/",8,2,9,9 October 2017
First Man," I mean, it aint't APOLLO 13, but it'll do
","I still can't believe I'm saying this, but Damien Chazelle did it again.That's not to say I'll not one day get tired of his central thesis laid on his filmography at this point. The idea that nobody should ever criticize anyone's ambitions no matter how much of a physical/emotional toll it takes on them borders way too close to masochism. And while WHIPLASH and LA LA LAND stands as genuine classics in their own right, there's a waning sense that Chazelle takes his goals too much to heart, wishing that he'd take a breather for once.So it's a refreshing change to see him showcase the bare basics of film craft with FIRST MAN, utilizing impressive special effects and cool 60s style stock lens without calling attention to itself. It pays a lot of detail to many of the mechanics of astrophysics, down to every strategic conversations and to each linger on rocket windows and altitude dials. You almost feel like you're there in the cockpit with the legendary astronaut yourself, experiencing both awe and panic at the same time.At first I felt trouble with the characterization of Neil Armstrong. A emotionless stoic trying to risk his life to land on the moon in order to cope with the loss of his daughter but then inflicts damage upon other people in the process. It doesn't really gel at first since that's not how grief works and it sounds like yet another self-deprecating parable by Chazelle but it wraps up in unexpected ways. Once he finally lands on the moon does he realize how finite and small life on Earth really is, how the glory of human achievement regains the pride of a nation, and how that same achievement needs to make us more fulfilled and humble as human beings. It's fairly faint but the wonderful visuals accompany it perfectly. There are some issues unaddressed, however. It does get repetitive at times and, while I do like how it gives Janet Armstrong and her family an agency, the movie does little for them other than 'make their scenes look like a Terrence Malick movie'. I also wanted some more comraderie, especially with co-pilot Buzz Aldrin. That would've been cool.Aside from that, color me unsurprisingly satisfied. Ryan Gosling, Jason Clarke, Clair Foy, Kyle Chandler, and Corey Stoll did an amazing job with their performances, the filmmaking is top notch, and the overall concept of watching the moon landing on the big screen alone is worth it itself. Houston, we have a winner.",8,3,11,13 October 2018
10 Cloverfield Lane," Good enough until it ended (You did it again, Abrams!)
","I will be honest, during the time that CLOVERFIELD dominated the hype media back in 2007, I didn't care all that much. Don't get me wrong, I wanted to see it and it maintains as good as I thought it would be, but man did the marketing got out of control. For all the time people speculated about the title, the tag line '1-18-2008', and constant ludicrous theories, I somehow became the minority when I kept saying 'It is just a Monster movie BLAIR WITCH style! Get over yourselves!' I didn't even bother to care what I thought the monster actually looked like, which I apparently was also the minority on among the utterly disappointed audience who saw nothing more than just a giant lizard. As for me, I liked it enough. Sure the overall payoff sorely needed, there was really some dumb moments, and the overall film almost swayed into Overrated territory, but it still hold enough for me as far as monster movies BLAIR WITCH style goes. With that being said, it is no surprise that I would also have mixed feelings with its 'blood relative' 10 CLOVERFIELD LANE. The first 90 minutes is a solid mix of elaborate problem-solving and an even darker spin on the people-trapped-in-a-room scenario (think ROOM but in the room throughout the movie), while the last part is... underwhelming to say the least. And it is at this point that we really could have seen this coming, especially from a Bad Robot production company. I would be the last to know how the whole JJ Abrams 'mystery box' marketing for his movies actually works for me, but I would be the first to elaborate how obnoxious it gets while trying. There is a level of patronization with the conceit of playing with my expectations and having the whole thing turn up like I always thought it would be the whole time, and I HIGHLY doubt that I am on the minority on the issue. Sure, a movie as good otherwise as THE FORCE AWAKENS or even CLOVERFIELD would dismiss it entirely, but this does conjure a lot of unfulfilled expectations that might taint these films despite their quality. But to the story. A woman named Michelle is held under supervision in an underground bunker by the man of Howard (John Goodman), who claims to save her from an impending danger up on the surface. Throughout the movie, we explore her interacting with both him and another guy while they, or rather the film, constantly hints at said impending danger that I, frankly, already know about fro the title. Things gradually get hostile with Howard, who may or may not be a closet psychopath, and the two other people find ways to piece together what is going on, and evidently escape only to face a pretty underwhelming ending. The movies strong points is definitely when the main characters are in the bunker. Outside of mystery teasing and Howard's creepy dual nature, the script manages to bring out these characters outside of their blank-state traits. Michelle in particular is the most well- rounded of them all, as we first see her running away from personal issues only to have her think multiple ways to solve them instead throughout the movie. What was once a confused, frail woman slowly but surely shifts into a bold, outward-thinking protagonist within the confines of her unfamiliar surroundings. Sadly, the other guy (John Gallagher Jr) just doesn't grow into me other than some dude trying to be funny.But at the end of the day, it is John Goodman who steals the show. What once framed as either kind-hearted, dignified, or just an everyman, his role might be his biggest and darkest turn for what otherwise could've been a tired crazy man stock character. Menacing and aggressive at one point, but dignified and collective in the next. He is also just a joy to watch, stealing almost every scene where he gets to lose his marbles! Had this film tanked in any way, he might still be worth at least one viewing.Heck, even the director earns great credit here. After enjoying these 90 minutes, I am certainly keeping track of Dan Trachtenberg for now on. He follows this film with a Portal short called NO ESCAPE, and boy does it resonate just as well here. The film is somehow structured like some sort of puzzle-solving point-and-click game where the main character finds elaborate ideas and inventions to progress the story. He certainly gets this down to the tee, as well as a good eye for composition, chilling still-shots, and making claustrophobic tunnel crawling instantly engaging. For all the films based on simple sets, it is quite a feat to draw us into every punch, scream, and chase scene leading up to the big ending......And then the ending happened, and the quality all dips down to 'meh'. Without spoiling, the point at which one of the main characters steps outside of the bunker sorely disconnected me. Not only does it drag and quickly skews over to ridiculous territory, it was basically a payoff that I already expected. Seriously, if you have seen CLOVERFIELD and got fooled by the trailers into thinking of something more, you really need to check yourself. Not only that, but it feels completely distant from the other parts of the movie, as if JJ Abrams was saying instead of calling it a 'blood relative,' he meant to say 'Look. This had nothing to do with CLOVERFIELD, so we decided to drop the name in to help the director sell more tickets!' Above all else, the movie is quite simply solid enough for recommendation, even though it could've been more tight with the ending, the stuff before is so good that I can't fault this merely for unmet expectationsRating: 7/10 (GOOD)",7,2,4,13 March 2016
Detroit," Incredibly solid but frustratingly narrow
","DETROIT is one of those movies so hurtful to critique harshly that I almost wouldn't bother and have other sites to take my word instead. On the one hand, I would love to see a movie - specifically a button-pushing procedural about the 12th Street Riots and the Algiers Motel incident - that slams subtle racism, abusive authority, and the overall spectrum of ignorant white man that continues to swarm our great country under the election of Drumpf. But on the other, it led me to wonder how much my wishes, and ultimately the final film, would compromise in the process. It was until I finally conclude that, no matter how much it seems 'right', my aspirations feel misguided. In simpler terms, DETROIT is an expertly crafted, visceral, and well-intentioned movie that doesn't do much justice. It's a film that shows no mercy in depicting the unforgivable acts upon the black people that may still persist to this day without considering the proper perspective of the blacks beyond the surface level and the overdone.But before I get ahead of myself, lets dig deep in the positives. For one thing, its NOT mainly an action war movie set in the riots. Director Kathryn Bigelow understands that the riots themselves was anything but 'thrilling spectacle' so it's played sparse, gritty, and grounded. Thanks to Bigelows additional talent of pseudo-veritee, each scene with the riots and the Motel incident feels and looks real and unflinching. Almost feeling like a torture montage, we witness every hit, every shot, every scream, and every shed of tear in each frame as if we are in the moment ourselves. Along with the shockingly great talent on hand to portray these roles, its probably one of the most harrowing film I've seen since DUNKIRK.Which ultimately disappoints me to say that the rest of the film feels too narrow and underdeveloped. First off, the black characters are deeply underdeveloped. As I watched the, admittedly horrifying, almost repetitive Motown scene in the second act, I noticed a weird overemphasis on developing the supposed white asshole cops rather than the suffering blacks. Sure they may have affected family members and backstories that get wrapped up rather neatly, but they only serve to both witness and endure the harrowing pain among the systemic racism at the time. John Boyega's black police character does barely a thing in this movie, serving as a POV to all of this brutality without much insight. The actors playing a Motown band only once speak up against the matter, but never do anything beyond that. Meanwhile, all the white actors - like the otherwise revelatory Will Poulter as a complex cop - get to be both the menacing and the sympathetic characters with more agency. And to my money, considering how it ends in a depressing ending in which the bad guys get away with 3 murders and 9 abuse charges (shut up, it's not a spoiler. Look it up), that's a huge miscalculation. It winds up in the typical 'have its cake and eat it too' scenarios that sadly renders the black people as passive martyrs rather than real people in their own f-ing movie.There's a boatload of think pieces about whether white filmmakers have any right to depict other cultures without their mindset. And while I admittedly have no objective say on the matter – since I'm white/Hispanic and not black – I also know that there's a fine line simply by experience. When I see movies like SELMA, STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON, or the latest TV show masterpiece DEAR WHITE PEOPLE, I commend their efforts to delve into how much systemic racism strangles our social climate to this day. But what makes these special stems from growing beyond that, offering new insight to the issue that never sacrifices the identities or humanity of black people affected by it. And the secret to that comes from a full black perspective that feels appropriate to their stories. Not to discredit Bigelow's talent or ambition, but it's one thing to sucker punch this issue in hopes for a change, but its another to exploit black pain to wake up white people to do so.Which is ultimately a shame because I can recall Bigelow doing much more than that. HURT LOCKER revolutionized our perception of war fatigue and the human condition during battle, ZERO DARK THIRTY was both a metatextual distillation of depleted post-9/11 American morale amongst multiple dead ends and the ultimate catharsis of the same. And let's not mention how f**king awesome POINT BREAK was. But Bigelow seems out of depth here. For all the hype and stupidly dense runtime, she cannot escape the ingrained distance from the proper way of telling this.Overall, DETROIT isn't bad but it stops short of being great. The riots are nasty yet alive, the acting is magnificent, and it damn near rejects the otherwise tone-deaf war epic alternative by being more grounded. But it stops dead to reach more than that, thinking it could be the definitive movie to 'get people woke' without noticing the dozen other movies that did it better. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it, and I hope the otherwise dreadful Trump administration would promote others to stop meandering and do better.Check out my letterboxd account for more reviews: http://boxd.it/k9td",6,4,11,8 August 2017
Fury," The best war movie of 2014
","I am not exaggerating with the title there. Considering the shallow 300 RISE OF AN EMPIRE, the even more shallow American SNIPER, to the serviceable UNBROKEN, it seems like 2014 has conjured quite an abundance of underwhelming war movies. That is not to be expected, since at the time we have been engaged in an actual war, and the prospect of delving into war movies that might draw comparisons to real situations seemed much of a stretch, even compared to war movies back in the 20th century. However, there is one war movie that stuck out from the crowd, not so much by story and character, but by grit, depth, and the ability to go full-force with what results from such war that parallels the current one so well. That movie is FURY, directed by David Ayer. Despite a few missteps, this movie easily accomplishes what most war movies sorely lack in this time. POSITIVE: Say what you will about David Ayer, he is one clever man. Most of what I desire from his movies is added depth and tangibility for otherwise sick and depraved people. With TRAINING DAY taking a good-cop/bad-cop story and creating smart, insightful deconstruction of right-abusing cops and 'by-the-books' moral ism that somehow makes us root for the characters, even when on the edge of degradation. Thankfully,FURY is no different. These characters, however done to death, are greatly humanized thanks to the script and the conditions they must adhere to. Brad Pitt's stern but sympathetic leader character with too much to lose, Shia LaBeouf's Bible-carrying saint faced with a major reality check, and Jon Bernthal's despicable degenerate character, who is still somehow the most sympathetic at all; these characters are done to death, but are excused thanks to a sharp writing and the conditions of what they go through. War is hell, and the gruesome depictions of it makes these characters makes more sense than the simple man caught in the wrong setting. Speaking of war, another Ayer perk is how much he holds NO punches. We see blood, heads blasting, people being set on fire, numerous firefights, among other things that would've fit in a dumb action movie. But, as stated before, it is not dumb, and they way they depict these scenes is out of grit and not lunacy, thus adding to the realism and dread of the setting. This is also buoyed by Ayers still- impressive directing talent, with great composition and editing skills. All while adding what is considered easily the film's highlight, the tense-building and seldom depicted tank battles.NEGATIVE: Sadly, Ayer isn't all too perfect. As much as I loved END OF WATCH, TRAINING DAY, etc., I just could not ignore the way he ends his movies. There is just a nagging feeling that he should patch up the overlong and, at times, ridiculous climaxes. FURY, as it turns out, is one of them. During the groups one last push against the enemy (which, to be fair, is amazing) the characters get axed off one by one in a way so heavy-handed and extensive it kind of jerks me out of the movie. VERDICT: In the end, no matter how cliché and predictable this movie turned out to be, all it matters is how much it works. And FURY definitely works! Trust me folks, give it a chance!RATING: 8/10",8,6,12,5 March 2016
Zootopia," How do they keep doing this?!
","It is actually getting scary right now. Ever since the Renaissance, they proved to make successful movies out of risky concepts. Movies like FROZEN and INSIDE OUT have given themselves a big challenge, but at the same time gives a wide array of ideas and depth and meaning, proving that these simple kids movies can resonate the same way, if not more, to adults. Now in ZOOTOPIA, the Mouse House have given themselves their boldest endeavor to date: creating a world entirely inhabited with anthropomorphic animals while also throwing jabs at an abundant supply of social commentary. The result is a smarter, more insightful, and even darker execution than we ever expect from Disney, while also being as charming, creative and at times heartwarming. And I will be damned that, even considering some missteps, this may not turn out to be one of the best movies of the year.The story centers around a rabbit named Judy Hopps who wishes to be a cop while being discouraged by the fact that they do not allow innocent prey as cops. Despite this, she proves to be cunning and willing enough to prove the world that she could save the world. She then earns her badge and is deployed to Zootopia, a New York Esq city filled with animals. Along her journey to rise above the ranks, she meets Nick Wilde, a sneaky fox who makes a living causing trouble with a personal scarring almost parallel to Hopps. While solving a case of a missing otter, they both team up to find him, all while delving into a much bleaker and more complex story that honestly needs to be seen rather than further explained.As expected with a premise like this, this movie goes full-force in its social allegory that resembles the world we live in today, an endeavor almost too risky to contemplate. In their universe, the predators and prey used to be on opposing sides until an act that makes them equal. Unfortunately, the predators now face overwhelming prejudice from a paranoid society, preventing them from shopping or being free from ridicule. Seriously! And it is quite apparent in his back story that Nick evidently lived his whole life with this.But that doesn't stop there. Without spoiling too much, a certain moment that might just be yet another forced conflict to transition to the third act, the movie then pulls out a wild card and turn this into a bigger issue: inventing said third act where the movie commentates on segregation, racial profiling, law enforcement with a compromised moral code, corrupt politicians, dirty secrets, and even the issues on mentally instability.WOW!Say what you want about Disney, they do NOT hold back on this. So much of this conflict is almost too rampant in our real world to bare, even for a kids movie. Thankfully, the movie knows its limits and keeps it accessible to the attended younger audience. That may be the strongest secret to this movie: It commentates on these issues while also tying into a rather coherent story and not have it over dominate the proceedings, thus making it preachy. And it all comes together in the finale, hopefully promoting a better future of equality, kindness, and everything else Martin Luther King preaches, thus benefiting itself into somehow being a more potent wake-up call than the utterly preachy and jumbled circle-jerk towards objectivism that was last years TOMORROWLAND. Even not considering all that though, the movie is also bursting with charisma and creativity that hovers. The movie brings extra detail into the practicality of how these animals inhabit Zootopia, thus creating a bunch of clever jokes as well. Hopps determined natured paired with Wilde's sly, quip-talking nature seemed too played out in other buddy-cop movies, but thankfully the script, however juvenile (it is a Disney movie after all), is tight enough to breathe these tropes onto its own. And yes it is worth noting that the voice acting from Idris Elba, Ginnifer Goodwin, Jason Bateman, etc. are all top-notch. There are a few missteps, though. It has been well-known that the new Disney movies like to play around with certain tropes of their own (FROZEN especially). Here they do quite a few of them, and some skews a little too on-the-nose. (see the movie to know what I am talking about). Even they do well with invoking some clever commentary with the animals, one in particular plays on for too long and serves little more than a DMV joke. The writing, however tight as usual, remains just enough to grasp for kiddies but fairs a little too obvious for me. To be fair, I expect that going into this movie, but I cannot shake occasional exposition that repeats plot points I already know. Small gripes notwithstanding, ZOOTOPIA is quite simply a revelation! A type of movie that turns the tired 'buddy-buddy cop' story into something more thought-provoking than this company would usually allow. A movie that will both leave kids with their minds nourished and their parents' eyes open, it is smart, charming, and inspired. Finally, 2016 has its first great movie!Rating: 8/10 (GREAT)",7,3,13,6 March 2016
Argo," A whole different type of spy thriller!
","Remembering the first time I have heard about this story in my Junior-year American History class - about a team of CIA spies pretending to be movie makers in order to save American hostages from Iran - I could only imagine how grueling and desperate this might have been, so much so that I could see why Carter had a hard time with this ordeal. No one can solve this ordeal as best as they could, even when we wane into the Reagan years. I also couldn't imagine making a movie out of one of the CIA courses of actions, i.e. staging a movie production of a Star Wars knockoff called ARGO, without turning it into a bad macho-enhanced action movie. And yet, here I stand to say that I am OVERLY glad that the movie ARGO takes the more serious, fairly logical, but extremely gripping route with this premise. The result: easily the best movie of Ben Affleck's career and one of those rare movies that won Best Picture that easily deserves it. POSITIVES: The performances are the selling point, with both Ben Affleck and Bryan Cranston selling their roles as the heavily cautious but emotionally determined catalysts of this endeavor, while Alan Arkin delivers some pretty funny lines. The movie also boasts some surprisingly impressive directing sensibilities by Ben Affleck; not only does he have an eye for shot composition and movement, but he also replicates the old-fashioned news takes quite well. My favorite shot is when they both promote the fake movie and parallels this with the torturing of the hostages, as they both show the desperation of the situation perfectly. But what really sells this movie is the third act when they try to get into the plane to get rescued. Jeeeeeez, talk about a heart race!!NEGATIVES: Now I am sure this movie is being vexed by those with huge 'white-washing' issues, being that the main character being cast as a white man, but this isn't really that much of a pressing issue for me, as it doesn't really specify any ethnicities of him in the first place other than his name. Not too much of a deal-breaker, but I understand why all the backlash came from. The movie also doesn't seem over saturated with more cinematic sensibilities, but I believe this movie isn't all that interested in doing so. Plus, it stands as gripping all on its own, but again I see why most of these people would say that this movie is 'unimpressive'. And yeah, to address the other critics out there who point this out, it sucks to see Jack Kirby (a Marvel Comic designer) getting a small role here, but again, that isn't too much of a deal breaker. VERDICT: With great suspense and surprising turn from Ben Affleck's career, ARGO is certainly the best spy action thriller disguised as Oscar baits in years. Definitely, believe the hype on this one!

Green Room," Simply awesome!
","Alright, here is the premise: a punk rock band signs up to a gig in the middle of nowhere that's full of nasty, hate-filled Neo-Nazis and eventually gets held hostage after their performance goes awry. From then on, it's a bloody, intense horror thriller with many lip service to the Romero-era zombie flicks with skinheads. The film is literally that simple, and yet somehow conjures up more than what we expect. Amidst all the violence and the effective horror sleight of hand, the true center of Green Room lies strictly on the surprisingly solid script and filmmaking. Under the helm of newcomer Jeremy Saulnier, the film delves into the struggle with these characters and their situation. Even though we like to see a bunch of teens killing off a bunch of skinheads Oldboy style, the band members never come close to being the heroes; some of them are poor, loathing bastards themselves and they strive for is no less different than their swastika-toting adversaries. What matters is what they react to their position they got themselves into, and what can reflect on to us in the slim chance we get into their situations. Even the final boss (a menacing Patrick Stewart) and his henchmen feel more grounded, as they feel as anxious as the band members and unwilling to cause any harm. In a Hollywood horror movie landscape as uninspired and lacking of any investment, here is one fresh out of a Film Festival playbook with more than just jump scares and gratuitous gore. Even the brilliance of the script out of the equation, Saulnier still manages to craft one hell of a tense movie. I cannot recall a horror movie in the last 10 years that has got me at the edge of my seat and shocked me out of it. Explaining how would be impossible, but just imagine The Conjuring if the camera lingered on that bed scene for a few seconds longer, and the payoff was bloodier. If this is what Jeremy Saulnier can manage, then I am proud of keeping him in y radar. Overall, I recommend this slickly crafted horror movie if for no other reason than you won't experience a more anxiety attack like this.

Suicide Squad," A bad movie, but a guilty pleasure?
","Here is how I encapsulate Suicide Squad in one scene in a movie. Not in any of the plot elements, the way the dialogue exchange, or the abundant gun-toting action scenes, but in the end credits. Yes, the end credits – where, after the world is saved by our 'heroes', we see them back to square one in their cells in the prison in the typical 'gritty reboot' Warner Bros aesthetic. Then, out of nowhere, Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie, who is by far the best part of the movie) escapes from prison via a jarring raid led by her methhead puppy-face Leto Joker. Then after that, the credits roll in a bombastic, colorful blend of purple and green vape gas while a rap song called 'Sucker For Pain' plays with Lil Wayne, Wiz Khalifa, and Ty Dolla $ign. It's not a particularly good song and the credits look phony and obnoxious, but it looks cool and based on my short range of crowd that I sort of hang around with. That's the whole summary of Suicide Squad in my viewpoint. Suicide Squad is - both objectively and inescapably - garbage. Scriptwise, the story makes no sense, plot points get repeated for no reason, backstories serve no purpose other than to rush character development, and most of the characters don't serve anything to the plot at all. Aesthetically, the direction defines choppy, the world in which the cast share isn't cohesive – one character looks straight out of a Grudge movie while another one looks like those S&M clowns that might fit in Spring Breakers – the tone has 'schizophrenic' written all over its face, (no thanks to those reshoots, because that always works!) and the CGI looks distractingly bad. Taken as a whole, it's the cinematic equivalent of the modern, lazy, pandering rap song made cynically by the intent of establishing a name rather than making good products. BUTeven considering how much I actually listen to those same bad rap songs, I still like it? Yes, the movie sucks and has no right to be overrated by those against the 'biased Rotten Tomatoes' , but I still find joy and guilty pleasure in this cluster of a movie.The story, for the record, is far too convoluted to summarize. After the events of Batman V Superman, Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) for some reason comes to the conclusion that the world needs the help of Gotham's rowdiest criminals. So she recruits Killer Croc, Boomerang, Harley Quinn, El Diablo, Deadshot, and some other guy, under the help of Joel Kinnaman as Rick Flagg and Katana to do some rescue mission. Oh, and Davis comes to terms with Enchantress – who looks like she was pulled straight out of a Troma-esque Grudge ripoff – in order to persuade the officials to use the Squad, only to eventually be held hostage for the film to set up a rather questionable twist. Oh, and Enchantress is controlling Flagg's boring girlfriend as she controls the city via a sky wormhole and a strangely crappy-looking demon brother who serves nothing other than a mini-boss. Oh, and the Joker shows up for no reason for both a flashback and in act 2 and literally drives and/or flies by the screen without any point.So yeah, like Batman V Superman, the movie suffers greatly by numerous plot issues and bad design choices. This time, instead of the Goyer- Snyder 'golden boys' screwing everything up, we have one man at the helm taking all the blame. Now I may like David Ayer's movies in his unapologetic, openly grimy movie catalogue, (I personally think Fury is still his masterpiece) but there is no denying the amount of weight he struggles to carry here, doubly so thanks to the reshoots. Constant shifts in tone, weak transition of plot elements, and a stupid-looking choices he makes with the purple and green color palette and supercharged cutting techniques make the film look occasionally phony, and that's before you see the final boss in her crappy-looking silk-sheets-as-smoke-clouds getup. In design, it's as if Ayer desperately panders to the new age of wannabe gangster Snapchat teens the way he panders to thugs in Harsh Times, as he also shoves on- the-nose pop songs in any scene possible. However, as someone who objectively follows some people in that demographic, I can't help but enjoy this broken apparatus. Even among the catchy soundtrack and weirdly enjoyable aesthetic, there is quite a lot of genuine good that's sadly squashed by the vape-stinking baggage. The backstory for both El Diablo and Deadshot are genuinely engaging however short-shifted, there's a small bar scene where they share fun banter, and I'd be lying if there aren't some good payoffs in the action scenes. Plus, I cannot deny the effort by Margot Robbie as the best Harley Quinn ever (although a bit oversexualized) , Will Smith and Viola Davis. All the rest are on autopilot, but its fun to see Jai Courtney hamming up as an Australian stereotype.Sadly, all the poor actors lose any goodwill by a terrible performance by one Jared Leto as the new Joker. Passing aside the way the film contrives his every screen presence, Leto simply fails at invoking any menace or charisma to this character. Initially, I like the idea of making the Joker of more like a modern street thug, but Leto tries too hard to make another Heath Ledger impression. The result is embarrassing and almost sleazy. If this shows up in the new Batman movie, then DC/Warner Bros is even more screwed than they already are.However, with that all in mind, this movie is the ultimate guilty pleasure. Nothing is good about it AT ALL, but I can't shake off the mindless, pandering, coked-up fun that is Suicide Squad. Take that for what its worth.For more reviews, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/08/review-suicide-squad.html",2,6,13,9 August 2016
Baby Driver," Pure cinema!
","Calling BABY DRIVER a feature length car chase music video seems like it's not doing it justice. Here is a film that painstakingly syncs each scene with each appropriate needledrop song to make it look like the most audacious musical ever, but it offers so much more than that. Offering the same, shameless glee of earnest romance, over-the-top car chases, and effective gun-to-gun thrillers of decades past, BABY DRIVER is simply everything. It's top down genre mix taping, courtesy of an inspired and precise auteur of Edgar Wright who did the same idea with video games back with SCOTT PILGRIM. Taken as a music video compilation though, it's pretty much next level. Each minute action and lip-synching is precisely matched to each 70-80s song that actually complements the circumstances of the plot. It's at times funny, foreshadowing, and at times grim, rewarding a lot of repeated viewings without being obscure.Taken as a homage to old, sleazy action movies, it's as much inspired. Rather than being full-on parody like the Kornetto trilogy, it embraces its genre inconography, reminding us why we like it in the first place. That's why each car chase, running, and gunfight sequence looks almost as great as early Walter Hill flicks or this years JOHN WICK. Heck, there's a shootout warehouses scene that's so awesome it puts the entirety of FREE FIRE to shame!Admits all of that though the movie is never oblivious to any genuine character moments and ace performances. Wright manages to accomplish specific character twists that both retorts their standard traits while also adding depth to them. For example, both John Hamm and Kevin Spacey might just be the breakout performances of this movie based solely on how they subvert our impressions of them. Ansel Egort does wonders in a role that seems too much like a clichéd wonder boy role, but comes aces as his own complex character. Baby's relationship with Debra feels like it's ripped wholesale from a Nick Sparks movie, but the execution feels honest and vacant of any BS contrivances. BABY DRIVER is not only a testament to Edgar Wrights craftsmanship, but also a testament to how any genre film far from Hollywood dreck can still be as successful as this. The action is amazing, the music rocks, the performances are great, the cinematography and editing are pitch-perfect, and it all offers a bravura of thrills without sacrificing a true artists vision. It is pure cinema and one of the best films of the year.",9,16,30,30 June 2017
Dunkirk," Interstellar is forgiven. Go see this.
","War is hell. You're shocked, I know.Film has no hesitation in reminding you that notion for nearly a century, especially those taking place against Nazis. Ever since they axed Hitler, Hollywood is so bent out of shape in exploiting this tired- ass setting by giving us a whole spectrum of good-to-meh WW2 movies.It's like they're exhaustingly transparent, offering us the same level of gunfights, bleeding, 'hoo-rah's, and the obligatory message mongering about the same damn words 'war is hell' and 'Nazis are bad'. PRIVATE RYAN, HACKSAW RIDGE, FURY - bunch of others I forgot. It's all extremely tiring to an extent, no matter how good they turn out.So, to my bewildered face, leave it to Christopher Nolan to up the ante and refresh this tired subgenre into something brutally engrossing and secretly clever. Nolan strips all the extra fat and BS from the resulting picture, leaving us into the fray in some of the most harrowing events in the battle of Dunkirk. It's exhilarating as much as it is depressing, constantly keeping me at the edge of my seat. The films biggest accomplishments is how it acorporates theme of time into the main machinery of the film. Hanz Zimmers score imbues ticking sounds to crank up the intensity for each time these characters try to survive. The film plays with the timeline with three scenarios (Aircraft: 1 hour/Seaboat:1 day/ Land: 1 week) and jumps in between them with carful and enticing etiting skills. Each character finds ways to either kill enemies or run away with depleting resources or low morale. Say what you will about Nolans cinema trickery, but it works when it works. He's constantly remind you that the biggest threat amongs our worn out soldiers besides Nazis is time itself. This his tinkering feels earned and smartly used without blowing up into pretentiousness (see Interstellar)But all of that would not mean a damn thing without the performances. With barely any dialogue, we get the clear sense of what they feel just by looking at these guys. Kenneth Branaugh brings out the most dignified performance as a general who struggles to keep his composure. Tom Hardy and Cillian Murphy work wonders with their demons of desperation and paranoia respectively. The soldiers, more specifically Harry Styles, never once feel out of touch and shows a lot of the hell they've put up with perfectly. And finally Mark Rylance is just magnificent as always in bringing out the heart and humbleness in his character.A lot of criticism of Nolans other work points out his lack of focusing on human emotions. I'd say this is finally a break of this mold. As the film slowly reliefs us of the hell that was the battle of Dunkirk, were treated with a finale that's not only a huge relief, but also a slimmer of joy. Soldiers cheering and civilians offering gifts and Rylance assuring the soldiers brace duties. It's like Nolan found something worth embracing for the first time in what seems like forever. Seriously that ending almost got me chocked up.DUNKIRK is a bravura of 'war is hell' imagery reworked in what it should feel like in the first place. As I sat there while the lights opened up during the credits, I stopped and finally said 'shit, I agree.' This is a corker, folks. Don't miss it.",9,1,6,24 July 2017
Captain America: Civil War," Batman V Superman's inverse opposite
","Ever since IRON MAN came out, I always ponder on whether or not the MCU's 'shared universe' experiment would pay off. Amongst the Phase 1 movies barely reaching above average and the obnoxious references to other movies within movies (to which AGE OF ULTRON became the worst example of), a small part of me wonders if any of it matters to the big picture, or if I actually stick around for said big picture. However, after seeing other superhero franchises executing this concept SO. FRICKEN. HORRIBLY, my doubts simmered while Marvels biggest secret became clear. They take their time in developing their wacky, comic-book universe while virtually blending it with the modern real universe, They care about these characters and their struggles so much as to have us care about them as well. They explore concepts and opportunities within these heroes and expands their meaning and what they represent to those that wrote them in the first place. And now with CAPTAIN America: CIVIL WAR, when the film might tread on the 'dark and moody' vibe instead of the campy escapist fare that they represent, they smartly delve into the morals of these already-established characters and their reasons for going off against each other, all while never being shy of occasional fun. The result, even considering a few missteps, blooms into the most grounded yet thrilling superhero movie since THE DARK KNIGHT; a shining example of Marvels status as engaging character- driven action romps with poignant philosophies about what we believe is the right course of action.The most glaring thing to consider about this film is that it doesn't really feel much like a Captain America movie as it is just another Avengers movie. Rather than the actual character taking front and center of his movies, his ideals, the way he solves issues, and how said ideals are being conflicted instead reflects on the other characters, with some of them opposing the Act because they feel they can do things right again. The biggest variation, though, is that none of their sides ultimately become the WRONG choice nor the RIGHT one. With Iron Man switching towards responsibility to contrast the irresponsible behavior prior and Steve Rodgers justified do-gooder turned independent vigilante, neither side trumps the other; sometimes it's good that the world is saved with a few casualties, but sometimes said casualties wind up too unbearable to cope with. All of this is due to the films willingness to implement 'breathing room'. All of this is due to the Russo Brothers character-driven television backgrounds, which allows them to set the story back a few times to properly flesh out these characters. I mean, c'mon! The idea of shoving in Spider Man and the Black Panther while simultaneously developing Scarlet Witch and Visions friendship, AND shifting focus on Captain America saving Bucky would sound like another AGE OF ULTRON disaster, but it pulls together this time! While some hiccups are inevitable in this gamble, the willingness to take its time, plus some actual stakes by the actual team and not just another army invasion, gives this story its lasting weight. And yes before you mention it, boy do I feel lucky to be alive seeing the best Spider Man and the best Black Panther! Tom Holland as Peter Parker and Chadwick Boseman as Black Panther both succeed in adapting these characters in a script that impressively establishes them without treading on their back story for too long. Even keeping the abundance of solid action scenes in mind, the introduction of Black Panther and Starks small talk with Parker might be two of the best scenes in this movie. But make no mistake, this film would never be worthwhile had it not been for the Russo Brothers surprisingly solid action. Seriously, this might be the best Marvel ensemble fight scenes ever! Explaining these would ruin the fun, but let's just say that the airport scene HOLY CRAP!Judging solely on the action scenes pairing with the conflicting ethics of regulation would instantly make a masterful film, but sadly it is not. Once that big fight gets out of the way, the film feels like it should conclude from there, only to shift into another fight scene due to one's own vendetta. No matter how bold of a move that is, to have this whole fight derive from a smaller but more personal struggle, but it took me out of the film to have yet another fight scene just a few minutes after another. You also might gloss over the 'villain' in this movie that brings up a worthwhile twist in the end, but I pay no mind to itNow I am sure there is quite a lot of discussion that my praise for this film strictly lies on my 'bias towards Marvel' after recently bashing DCs shameless aping of this shared universe. Trust me guys, I strained to stick with my doubts on this one. I desperately find anything wrong with this movie despite the ratio of reception of film and BATMAN V SUPERMAN telling me otherwise. Sadly, I stand with my statement. This is not only miles better than DAWN OF JUSTICE, but I am right on board on the ever-so redundant but inevitable discussion that this is an opposite inverse of that in quality terms. Smart and funny writing instead of stupid and self-important trailer fuel; struggles based on character-based ideals instead of dumb manipulation; dark tone for meaning and weight instead of mindless aesthetic mimicking. Even that notwithstanding, this makes a confident, everlasting, and fun superhero movie properly made better by the eight years of world-building that has finally payed off. I would say watch it and judge for yourselves, but I believe my stand is as follows: SEE THIS ONE INSTEAD!",8,6,14,8 May 2016
X-Men: Apocalypse," A limping sequel compared to Days Of Future Past
","I really wanted to like the X-MEN franchise. Even before Marvels Iron Man, the old movies never stick with me other than noticing how dated they were.And for a moment, there might be a chance to update or even reinvigorate this series, what with First Class being awesome, Days of Future Past being better than expected, and Deadpool actually having fun with itself. But after watching ApocalypseÂ… I was disappointed. While not terrible, this movie pretty much encapsulates the bland, dated, and totally clumsy aspects of the older X-Men movies with the sparse amount of good things spaced out by uninspired or flat-out bad things. It never rises any more than above average and occasionally falls below it, but it is overall better than what it could have been. The story, for one, is far too simple. Apparently there was an ancient, all-powerful mutant called Apocalypse who, after a century-long power nap, inadvertently gets reawakened and decides that mankind needs to be destroyed because how else do we set up the third act fight scene? In doing so, he unites a new set of mutants (or old mutants but younger), while also amplifying their powers in an attempt to kidnap Charles Xavier so that they can use his mind powers (GEE, THAT SOUNDS FAMILIAR!!) Meanwhile, the mutants back at the Mansion, both old and new, pretty much dawdle around until a major plot turn prompts them to stop him and his rogue mutants. No, really, that's it. Now this wouldn't be a total issue, but that's only if it allows some compelling connective tissue. As a screenwriter, your options are A): add some interesting character dynamics, arcs, or even just world- building, or B): add needlessly complicated plot points that at least prompt the characters to trudge along until the final blowout. Sadly, this movie does neither, thus making the whole story feel empty and unmotivated. During the transition to the second act, after almost 40 minutes of character introductions and pointless meandering, the film then detours to a pointless Wolverine cameo, where the young Stryker kidnaps the mutants for some reason. After that, they decide NOW to go to Egypt to stop Apocalypse and bring back their professor. There's no rising or falling action, no defining themes that gave this series its lasting weight, no further explanation to its jumbled continuity (why is Wolverine taken in by the real Stryker rather than Mystique from the last movie?) no 80s-era context outside of pointless banter about how bad the third Star Wars movie was (Do you smell irony?), or no tangible stakes at hand, despite the movie insisting how powerful Apocalypse looks by destroying the city, because that hasn't been done enough already. This monotony also extends to the characters. Angel, Storm, Psylocke, and Nightcrawler have no purpose outside of fighting. Mystique at one point positions herself as a revolutionary for the mutants â€“ because who isn't sick of seeing Jennifer Lawrence pulling that shtick again â€“ but then does nothing. Magneto gets a new family at least, but it serves no purpose other than the movie needed for him to get sad and be evil again. There is a stunning, albeit stupid plot twist involving Quicksilver that goes nowhere in the end, but he's once again extraneous and only there for that same speed show from the last movie. Oh hey! Jubilee is finally in these movies, but for pretty much the same role as the old X-Men cartoon, which is no role. Only Jean Grey comes close to any dimension, growing from a frightened mutant tormented by her powers and then fully blossom in an admittedly dazzling finale. But then there's Apocalypse, played by the unfortunate Oscar Isaac. I could go on by how dull and aloof the other performance is (Jennifer Lawrence in particular looks so bored throughout this movie it feels like a protest) but Isaac as Apocalypse in particular delivers the most unforgivably ridiculous performance. To say nothing of his boring character and over complicated set of powers, he looks and acts like a total fool, as though his glaringly terrible makeup design wasn't bad enough. Speaking of design, you'd think the films saving grace would be the action and the CG, right? WRONG! Further proving that X-Men veteran Bryan Singer possesses no grasp on big-scale stories like this (ask me about Jack and the Giant Slayer some time), this movie inherits the worst of the old movies, with awful CGI, flat aesthetic, overuse of establishing shots, and uninspired fight scenes. I'm not saying that Singer is a bad director more than I'm saying that he works best in small-scale thrillers like Usual Suspects and even Valkyrie. Now it seems like the reigns of Matthew Vaughn have totally slipped the proceedings, delivering the same TV-level style that I thought we passed over by now. Believe me, folks; I wanted to like this movie. I wanted a comic book movie other than Disney that could really prove as a true competitor in the modern movie landscape. But as I stand, X-Men Apocalypse is too reliant on the old with not much new to the table. Here is to hoping that the next movie, or rather a new production crew, would finally give this tired franchise the X- Men First Class level high back. As it stands, its meh.For my full review, check out my blog! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/05/review-x-men-apocalypse.html",5,12,25,28 May 2016
Jerry Maguire," Pretty swell.
","1996 seemed like a weird year at the movies.People could finally laugh at horror movies with SCREAM, American culture's obsession with the end of the world led to INDEPENDENCE DAY and TWISTER's box office success, both FARGO and TRAINSPOTTING caught audiences and critics by surprise, and the whole sector of cinephiles stood together in disgust that a movie like THE ENGLISH PATIENT could win Best Picture.I'm not a sociologist so I'm not sure how that amounts to when defining the cultural zeitgeist of the late 90s. However I will say that if there's any movie that, to me, properly distills what life felt like back then, I'd say it's either JERRY MAGUIRE or FARGO. Since I already saw FARGO, this Scavenger Hunt is dedicated to this instead.Cameron Crowe missteps quite a lot since his heyday as director, but boy did he had a voice. The sensitive, emotionally broken vision he conjures transcends this otherwise melodramatic story into something we can all relate to. Beneath our grin and multi-million dollar facade, we are all still people with emotions and needs. The center of all this is the Space Pope himself Tom Cruise, reverting his TOP GUN swagger into a performance packed with charm and pathos.Whereas FARGO captured the cynical extremes of human choices and how it affects all of us, JERRY MAGUIRE encapsulates a time where we get so fixated on fame and success to mend our lonely lives. And Cameron Crowe reassures us that sometimes, expressing your emotions won't cause the end of the world. Maybe it's okay to settle down and warm up to people once in a while. Even if you're on the hurdle towards your lowest point, all you can depend on is that one person who really cares about you for you.It cannot possibly compare to the extended cut to ALMOST FAMOUS - because almost nothing can - but I was shocked that this still hits in the feels.",8,2,3,26 July 2018
Toy Story 2," They made this movie within 9 months. 9! Don't give up on your dreams.
","This movie, without question, fails to live up to the purity of the original. Right down to the callbacks and the often slack narrative, TOY STORY 2 only further highlights the truly unique experience of the first one. One of the few crazy ideas that alchemized into something thoughtful, character-driven, and thrilling, there's no way it could be replicated. I mean, just look how A BUGS LIFE turned out.But with all the baggage held against the sequel, it's also without question it's the most ambitious. Thoroughly expanding its story to deeper, more existential questions, it's the rare sequel that earns its EMPIRE STRIKES BACK level praise. It's finally a movie that questions what truly makes for a great life for a toy: standing behind glass walls and loved by everybody forever, or live with a finite relationship with a child destined to grow out of you soon.Buzz gets the backseat this time around, centering the story on Woodys turmoil while his space friend endure some hijinks to rescue him. People might say his side story is the sole weak point but I'd argue it's necessary for the story; it's a lot of heavy themes at play, so the gang deliver just the right amount of humor to level the tone.By now, everybody knows the Prospector turns out to be a last minute bad guy at the end. My take on this is how seamless of an antagonist he is; the idea that all toys are destined to be thrown out looms heavy on these characters. So much so that any of these characters can snap to immoral tendencies at any minute. This is why Kelsey Grammer delivers a phenomenal performance here. He's comforting as the Prospector but you can clearly hear the history behind it all. You can hear the desperation of his character, let alone Jesse and Bullseye too, and the film slowly builds that desperation into villainy that seems tangible.As for Jesse, let's just say there's a particular moment with her that personally spoke to me. Not gonna say which though, seems like an easy answer.Again what can I say; TOY STORY 2 is a grand achievement that could've done much less.",9,1,1,9 July 2019
The Departed," For those who STILL haven't seen it yet.... SEE IT!!
","Here is one of those movies that prove that there is no other person who can do Police/Gangster dramas better than Scorsese. Among the fast-talking characters, the bloody violence, a plethora of quick- paced, fast-cutting montages, and other of Scorsese's other filmmaking quirks, this is easily the most grounded, most clever, and most engaging of these movies rarely replicated even today. With solid acting, a tangibly gritty New York atmosphere, and a whole lot of blood, THE DEPARTED is as good as you heard, and easily the pinnacle gangster movie since THE GODFATHER.What comes into play is the dynamic between both the undercover cop, the head cop, and the mob boss. The two know who he is, and are always under tension from whoever takes him down. All of it adds up to some of the bloodiest, coolest gun battles and punch-throwing I have ever seen. The cast is terrific as always. Scorsese uses his actors to their fullest potential and they all shine. DiCaprio may seem like his pretty-boy looks does not fit this movie, but it works; a troubled undercover detective caught way over his head with both the dangerous mob scene and the detective work that may or may not be using him. Matt Damon is as charming as always, and there is always some fun to be had with Martin Sheen, Mark Wahlberg, and even Alec Baldwin. But hands down the best performance is the great Jack Nicholson. For such a rotten, pride stricken mob boss, he is clearly having fun as always. Outside of that, there really isn't much to say that requires a spoiler warning, so yeah. GO SEE IT! The cast is great, the story is lean and simple yet engaging, Scorsese directs the hell out of this with his usual style, and it is all around a bloody good time!",9,0,2,19 April 2016
Stranger Than Fiction," Kaufman-lite. Don't bother.
","If you know my style, ambiguous movies are always a scream for me. A film with so much subtext and inner symbolism gives me a lot to enjoy while dissecting and interpreting at different angles. The oeuvre of David Lynch, Alejandro Jodorowski, Stanley Kubrick, and even Charlie Kaufman all live up to this notion, offering masterpiece after masterpiece.However, there are some hackneyed films and filmmakers that shamelessly try to replicate that sort of style. Where they make a story buried in subtext and 'mind-twisties' without any grace or intelligence to make it all work. A movie that thinks its soooooo smart with the subtext but winds up obvious and pretentious, and offers a unique universe that is barely explored beyond plot mechanics that make no f-ing sense. And said hackneyed filmmakers is Marc Forster and screenwriter Zach Helm, and said film is STRANGER THAN FICTION, a stupid, bland, pretentious mockery of a Charlie Kaufman film without any understanding of what makes them great in the first place. It's literally ADAPTATION for morons.Will Ferrel stars as a mediocre IRS agent living a normal life until a narration explains his everyday life like he lives in a novel. See, his whole life is orchestrated by this narrator, a real life author who makes great stories about troubled people. He suddenly hears her, and needs to find the narrator in person in order to understand his true fate.Sounds interesting, but that's about it. There's literally nothing else underneath that beyond 'boy this sounds trippy, yo!' There's no underlying subtext about the nature of authorship, no impressive visuals or symbolism, or any depth of this world beyond the surface level. All it does is illustrate how everyone's lives are like stories right down to the minute plot progression and arcs as if we never took 9th Grade English class! Even then, it's used no more than a guy loosening up, finding his fun inner self, and get laid to a spunky and rebellious girl in the end. Because WE HAVEN'T SEEN THAT ENOUGH ALREADY! This is another problem: the film tells waaaay too much of what should be shown. Subtext is way too much the text in this movie, in which characters blurt out what we should interpret on our own. Here's an example: one of the psychiatrists (played by a bored Dustin Hoffman, no doubt) suggest that this 'real story' could either be a tragedy or a comedy. So Ferrell experiments this to aforementioned spunky rebellious girl in a bakery. She tries acting nice to him, but because he's a stereotypical stick in the mud, he rejects unintentionally. She reacted slightly unkindly, to which Ferrell notices. Had the scene end right there, we would've got enough information about whether or not it's tragic or comedic all on our own. But then it keeps going, with Ferrell comically saying 'You were being nice and I rejected it. I guess this ends in tragedy.' SERIOUSLY?! WHO WROTE THIS? Oh and it doesn't matter since they pork 20 minutes later anyway. Oh well. The whole film is like that, where it constantly holds your hand and expects you to be impressed by its genius. All I'm thinking about is 'JUST GET TO THE POINT!' But here is what really blows my horn. The narrator is supposed to be this high-class author who makes poetic movies about lonely man, and there is a certain recurring sequence of event of which they endure that truly makes it 'masterful pieces of work' But as I sit there, I realize, 'well why does it matter if that event needed to happen to Ferrell and what kind of poetry to his life should be 'profound'?' It's literally a boring life Ferrell's character is living in, and said event wouldn't make a damn difference at all. Its heavily emphasized in great importance that the inevitable event in his life that the narrator is constructing is what makes this 'story' work, but I don't see a damn bit of difference at all! Not to spoil, but it makes no sense.Even among the frustrating screenplay, everything else is all smack dab right in the middle of 'Not bad but not good' section. The cinematography is uninspired, the actors merely act instead of conveying earned and true emotions, the color palette is drab, and the movie is overall a slapdash of clichés and fake emotional moments. I'm more than certain it has its fans, but I'm still hard-pressed to realize how anyone, who has seen at least ONE drama or ONE mind-bender' in their lives, should like this.",4,0,3,13 June 2017
The Greatest Showman," Turn it down a notch, will ya?
","Even after seeing the overblown mess that is THE GREATEST SHOWMAN, I still can't believe they bother to make this. Dawning the promotional tagline 'from the same lyricists of LA LA LAND', this years hot new musical feels slap-dashed, scrambled, and razzle-dazzled together in order to cynically profit off its success with embarrassing results. It's the type of year-end crowd-pleaser that talks your ear out about following your dreams and forget the haters, yet is also so obnoxiously over-the-top yet thoroughly forgettable it almost tunes itself out. It's like if HAMILTON was remade for the Disney Channel.It stars Hugh Jackman as P.T. Barnum as he goes through the 'Started From The Bottom' routine and turn from a poor apprentice into the worlds most famous entertainers. He falls in love with Charity to her fathers disapproval, but prevails because true love. He then gets stuck in a low-end job that gets bankrupt, to which he gets inspired to create a museum full of larger-than-life characters. He then gets the extra endorsement from Zac Efron as a playwright who falls in love with one of the performers played by Zendaya. Then he suddenly gets bitter after a dispute with his troupe and his wife after he discovers that he wants more, which suddenly leads to big consequences. Then they get back together through a sing and dance number. Jumping Jesus, that's a lot of story. The whole thing has too much both onscreen and on paper that it suddenly became nauseating. Penned by Bill Condon in his second forgettable musical this year, it has the usual crap pacing, wasted opportunities, at least half a dozen arcs and cliches, and subplots left on the cutting room floor. It constantly blows over predictable storybeats through break-neck speed that you start to wonder what the fuck is going on. On top of that, commercial director Michael Gracey adds a whole bunch of calculated splendor - even in scenes where they're just talking - to this garbage screenplay in order to fool you into its supposed majesty. To me, I just got tuned out after the third time they sing.Speaking of things overproduced, I've never heard anything so needlessly bombastic as that soundtrack. Along with the aforementioned visual eye rape, each music number sounds like it really thinks the movie is some transporting adventure. It really just sounds like they took that opening song from HAMILTON and copied the same swooning violin and blaring percussion in every goddamn song. Even in scenes where it calls for a moody, somber treatment instead feels like we're fighting in the Battle in Narnia. I just wanted to tell these guys to dial it the fuck down. And then there's Barnum himself. It's admittedly nice to see Jackman shine in a happier role after LOGAN, but this is just a thinly written character. Glossing over the more nitty-gritty aspects of the historical figure, Barnum trudges along the same familiar beats of first being a starry-eyed optimistic to flat-out dickhead in the end. Even the shambling script leaves him no real footing to his arcs, leaving Jackman all dewey-eyed through numerous pitfalls and successes that mean nothing.If the film offered me a glimmer of hope, it's when we're introduced to the 'acts' themselves. Even at first seems exploitative to their appearances, these larger-than-life misfits look like they're packed with hidden stories and aspirations of their own. During one scene in which they sing in defiance against their oppressors, I almost leaped with joy... until it suddenly cuts to the same damn music template, in which I felt pissed again. For a movie about finding humanity in unusual places and finding your place, it's saddening to see these characters pushed aside for butthole Barnum and his stupid white people problems. I'd rather watch these guys again.A common criticism about last years rapturous LA LA LAND was that it was all glam but no depth. Even if I'd agree that most people - like me admittedly - overrate this movie to kingdom come, there's a certain charm, effort, and specificity to LA LA LAND that made it sing more clearly than this movie ever can. Imagine if LA LA LAND was like a smooth, adventurous melody while SHOWMAN was like what if your 5-year-old son fumbles with your keyboard set.Like any crummy movie, though, it tries to excuse itself by being for the fans and not the dreary critics. In one scene, a critic meets Barnum and states that the show is little more than smoke and mirrors, to which Jackman remarks by highlighting how much smiles he makes by the audience. As glib as that sounds, I couldn't help but agree. In many ways, THE GREATEST SHOWMAN is like the latest pop music that the current generation won't shut up over; its loud, repetitive, incomprehensible, and packed with a heavy-handed message to make you think it's more important that it really is.  But hey! Give it a month, and you'll get tired of it and forget it even exists.",3,29,74,20 December 2017
X2: X-Men United," 'Booooooooring' - Homer Simpson
","Here's what I say about the 'best' movie in the X-Trilogy: I took a nap during this slog three times. Three.I'm all for movies that focuses on character work and personal stakes instead of big explosions in my superhero movies, but this constructs the blandest and vaguest versions of those possible. An aggressively boring movie not only wrecked by ugly sets and a horrendous pace, but also by how it fails to live up to the central conflicts in the movie. Strykers son feels completely contrived, only there to freeze Xavier out of commission in the third act, and Wolverines journey to his past just marks down things we already know. It all feels like filler, with the whole 'global headache' in the end not holding any stakes.The only scene that really registered with me is probably the least necessary plot-wise but perfectly highlights the 'Mutants as metaphor for civil rights' angle. The scene where Iceman meets his parents in shock - which then follows Pyro killing armed cops with explosions - is easily the most emotionally riveting and coolest scene out of all of these movies. And the crazy thing about it: we don't even need it in the movie! It's just a detour for the characters to seek refuge only to get picked up by the hovercraft anyway.Yeah, I just don't care. Personally, I choose the first movie simply because it's shorter and more to-the-point, despite looking a whole lot cheaper.",4,0,1,9 July 2019
The Nice Guys," Shane Black is back baybee!!!
","Can we just stop for a moment and thank the all-that-is-cool demigod Shane Black? Seriously, he wrote the scripts of some of the classic action movies like Last Action Hero, The Last Boy Scout, and the iconic Lethal Weapon trilogy, which encapsulates a whole generation of masculine action movies. Utilizing this experience he built throughout those movies, he went to direct his action parody debut, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, a film claimed by many to be his masterpiece. Though many might be write him off as yet another cynical action director based around scummy a-holes doing scummy a-hole stuff, I believe that these films hold some deeper context; outside of delivering action comedy chops, what really makes Black stand out is the way he observes and deconstructs his main leads and the environment around him. The way Tony Stark deals with his insignificance and anxiety in the Avengers universe in Iron Man 3, Lockhart and his position as a thief in KKBB, the whole works. His endeavor this time, in his latest The Nice Guys, he examines two passÃ©, hot-tempered detectives unable to cope with the new generation, all while delivering the most brutally hilarious and endearing buddy cop movie any buddy cop movie can ever transcend to. To what amounts to a mixture of Lethal Weapon and Inherent Vice, it centers around a single father and licensed PI Holland March (Ryan Gosling), who is hired to investigate the apparent suicide of famous porn star Misty Mountains. Among this search, he comes to terms with an unlicensed and unmerciful detective Jackson Healey (Russell Crowe) and his brass knuckles, both hired by the young hippie. However, it all gets worse when Misty, who reveals to be an anti-pollution activist named Amelia, vanishes and it becomes apparent that March wasn't the only party interested. As both men are forced to team up, they'll have to take on a world filled with eccentric mobsters, exotic 70s-style strippers, and a possible government conspiracy.One of the things that fascinates me about this move is that amidst all the shootings and trashy humor, there is quite a fascinating subtext about a new coming generation overlying the old. These two cops, along with most of the other characters, represents the retrograde, no-nonsense police enforcers now out of their depth with the new generation. At the heart of this subtext and what ultimately brings some unexpected heart to the film is Angourie Rice as the young daughter of March Holly. Having to deal with the hardships and goon mix-ups the same level as her father, she still endures to be tough and capable in her own right and restrain herself and others from going over their limits. Of all the themes I came to expect from this movie, the implication of a younger generation could stand more superior to the wide array of brutes, dirty strippers, trigger-happy criminals, or even police officials honestly passed my radar.But enough of that pretentious baloney! What you'll likely get from this movie is a plethora of slapstick humor, gun-toting action, and hilarious banter from the two main leads who might as well be called Abbot and Costello with a lot more balls! Crowe, as expected, is a blast to watch, portraying a husky, no-BS private eye who kicks all sorts of ass but also manages to bring some humanity near the end. But the big surprise is Ryan Gosling, bringing an unexpected Buster Keaton-type humor character. Of all of what I usually expect from a Ryan Gosling role (from romantic main lead to un ironic main leads) his turn as sort of a fun and ironic role is instantly his most memorable. However, for all that goodwill, I still struggle to call this film on par with KKBB. The reason lies strictly in design; KKBB is essentially a parody of these types of buddy cop movies that constantly breaks the fourth wall and pulls the rug from your feet with every twist out of the conventional story beats. This movie, though, sticks to be fairly predictable. It still works as is, and thankfully the movie stays far away from several clichÃ©s, but for the most part, anyone paying attention might catch up with about 40 minutes ahead at most. It is definitely not a deal breaker, but a compromise definitely from true greatness. Minor issues aside, it's pretty awesome! The jokes are funny, the dirty stuff are really dirty, the character moments are engaging, the old-fashioned and exotic 70s setting feels lived in and compelling, and Shane Black remains the best at directing intense action. Definitely a would-be classic!Rating: 8/10",8,10,22,21 May 2016
Warcraft," Not good, but still fun?
","I feel as though I should be conflicted with my thoughts on Warcraft. The spectacle of seeing the whole perspective of hype turning into savaging anti-hype of this movie should make people like me sit out and ruminate for how I feel about the movie as a whole. But I don't; glaring flaws aside, I still appreciate it. Make no mistake – it's an overwritten, occasionally phony, shell of a movie, but chock full of ambition and the classic ludicrous charm. When it comes to fantasy action/adventure romps, I would openly compare this to Brett Ratner's Hercules, a movie that is also not traditionally 'good' but bask itself with ironic fun. The story pretty much boils down to a conflict between Orcs and humans, as the human realm of Azeroth endures an invasion from the Orcs for no other motive other than to find a new home to replace their dying realm. Among the Orcs are Durotan - a would-be father conflicted by his orders to attack the humans by force and his desires to endure a peaceful route – and Gul'dan, an evil warlock Orc so obviously evil it's near baffling. Among the humans could be humbly classified as 'stock king' 'stock future king' 'stock half-breed' and 'stock rogue character' who all come to terms with 'stock secret bad guy' to fend off the intruders. Will the humans end this peacefully or with force? Who is the real bad guys? Will the humans trust the Orcs or will this movie end badly? Are you sure you need answers to all these questions?All kidding aside, the movie does wisely takes the ambiguous approach to this storytelling. Not only does it make both sides virtually more complex, but it also pays homage to the old games where players chose which faction they would play. Even though the movie constantly insists you on caring for these otherwise one-note characters, the way it emphasizes their struggles is bolder than any summer movie would dare to be. The Orcs don't intend any harm; they just need a new home. The humans don't really want to kill them as much as they want to protect their world. They just need to do what they need to do and that's it. These attempt at dynamics, sadly, cripples itself once we actually get to the meat of the story, which is way too bloated and way too unfocused. It feels as though the movie either wants you to understand every last speck of world mechanics or to have us ease into the broader surface of the story, so it opts for both clumsily. The Orc scenes (which are easily the best part, don't get me wrong) are clearly have us invested in their overall struggles with little to no explaining the whats, hows, and whys, while the human scenes sadly convers that for them and little else with one expositional dialogue after another. Its makes matters worse when the real actors aren't all that interesting, with Travis Fimmel playing the weak sauce Aragorn clone, and Dominic Cooper slogging himself as the King. The less said about how unfortunate Paula Patton looks and acts in her ridiculous half-breed get-up the better. It's tedious and bloated, but not really offensive on my part. Honestly, once we get the whole 'this is important, pay attention' detail out of the way, it just looks like gangbusters. There will no doubt be a bazillion articles ruminating on Duncan Jones shift from his other works and how much he's out of his league with this movie, but I cannot deny how committed to this bizarre aesthetic of the Warcraft games. He is, no doubt, out of his league and this movie is by far the weakest of his relatively short catalogue, but his basic elements play out well enough here; the world of Azeroth looks beautiful yet lived in, the CGI is used in the best of their capabilities (specifically in the impressive motion-capture with the Orcs and the lavishing action scenes), and there is a very potent theme of family dynamics and emotional conflicts. Granted this movie lacks any sort of consistency, gravity, or enough compelling characters to make it great, but the way it compensates that for such loyalty to this goofy Warcraft aesthetic doesn't mean it's anywhere near lazy.It seems as though I should really hate this movie, much as the movie itself tempts me to, but I really don't. No, this isn't the Battlefield Earth of video game movies, nor is it the beginning of the end of bad video game movies finding some level of good quality. But it's a fun, weightless yet hugely ambitious, movie that cannot be denied for what it tries. Destined to be a cult classic.For more reviews, check out my blog!! http://itachisan125.blogspot.com/2016/06/review-warcraft.htmlRating: 6/10",6,1,4,12 June 2016
Sully," Solid, if a bit clumsy, portrayal of an everyday hero. Better than Flight!
","It's kind of depressing for me to witness a growing contempt in Hollywood icon Clint Eastwood. To be clear, all of it is for good reason. I personally don't care for his political views, nor do I stomach his recent, unpleasant comments on my generation. His 2012 support for Mitt Romney hasn't been more than an embarrassment. His films also haven't reached critical success for a decade and, topped with his baggage with the media, still probably won't be for a while. It's a shame that a man who once started out as an out-of-nowhere classic icon and also a well-acclaimed director will now be remembered by the new generation as 'that crazy old guy'. Even then, it's still a bummer considering that he's still capable of making great work. He has a great eye for filmmaking and an unrestrained approach to storytelling. His biggest perk is designing simple yet effective tales out of troubled historical figures. There's no 'what if' or 'how come' in his stories. Just the basic 'it is what it is' style of his biopics. Some might complain that there isn't much meat to chew on as a result, but what makes Eastwood great as a storyteller lies in the trust he bestows on subjects he feels has just enough resonance on its own. Sometimes that works great (Letters from Iwo Jima) and sometimes it doesn't (J. Edgar). With Sully, which tells the story of a recent plane landing on the Hudson River by Chesley Sullenberger, he once again reaches that same template with great earnest to the now-retired hero. The result is a solid, well-intentioned, slightly clumsy, tribute to a historical figure that no man other than Eastwood can make. Now the life of Sullenberger is a fairly straightforward one. Once during a flight in Flight 1549, a major turbulence caused by out-of-nowhere birds forced Sullenberger to attempt a miraculous landing in the Hudson River. After saving everybody on the plane, he is held as an 'All American Hero' even though he just did his job. However, the NTSB, after an investigation on the wreckage, finds evidence to suggest that he committed an irrational act and found evidence of an alternative and safer method to land the plane. But Sully, along with his co-pilot, suggest that his human instincts point to the contrary, even going as far as to deny the dozens of flight simulations against his claim. Is he right? Did he act rationally? Or does the big, bad, mean NTSB just trying to tarnish his reputation? Do you seriously need answers to all of these?Now I know a bunch of smarty pants is bound to compare this to another plane movie Flight since both films are about pilots who attempted miraculous landings and somehow gets ridiculed for it. But while Flight was an overrated, unlikeable slog where such a landing can only be achieved by an under-appreciated drunk who shoots up blow and abuses his friends, Sully takes a simple, likable explanation. He is just a man with past experience with a plane who believes in doing what he can to save as many people as possible, even if it means not landing on a runway. He has a lovable relationship with his wife and kids who gets separated thanks to a swarm of media news people. He feels that the NTSB forgets the fundamentals of human instinct so much that they wouldn't see the danger of not complying with it. The only piece of extra information we get is when Sully suffers from reasonable nightmares of the plane crashing which resulted from him not committing to the Hudson in the first place (in beautifully crafted CGI plane crashes). Though otherwise, Clint Eastwood adds little more to this story and instead focuses on a man who just simply did his job and gets the well-deserved hero status, which leads to probably his most heartwarming piece in his career so far. Sadly, that does lead to a lot of issues. The film's structure is a little all over the place for starters; Todd Komarnicki's scattershot screenplay rearranges the events rather than in order, which honestly would've been the better route. It starts with Sully after the crash, then before, then even back to his younger days, then the events at the hearing. It's a weird structure and it's made worse by the film deliberately finding ways to film the crash from multiple angles. Another issue lies in the film being too one-note in its short and sweet storytelling, in which Eastwood frames the NTSB as the bad guys who misunderstood Sully's act of heroism. It gets reasonable at first, but then once the film shifts into the 'man vs machine' court case, it gets distracting. I expected that to be the case all along, especially from a film made by an anti-government conservative, but it's still unfortunate to see a huge sacrifice in complexity, both in narrative and in character. Huge issues aside, this is a fine surprise for me and a huge improvement for Clint after the two-punch disappointments back in 2014. Tom Hanks is still great in his otherwise straightforward role. The way the film represents an everyday hero is admirable and sentimental. The runtime is deliberately shorter so it doesn't overstay its welcome. And yes, lo and behold, Eastwood amps up the production value in this for the first time in forever, with simple camera work and impressive CGI plane sequences. In a weekend of sad recognition of 9/11, Sully deliberately arrives in the right time to remind us about that little heroic event that's bound to bring us hope in the near future. Should this be Eastwoods last film, it'd be a great closure to an impressive career.http://hydebarker.blogspot.com/2016/09/review-sully.html",7,2,4,11 September 2016
