Alien 3," It gets better with time
","I totally agree with other reviewers that this movie grows with time.Not so much because of the new monster and horror, but because of the graphical design of the scenery and the atmosphere. The filmic expression is very well and consequently followed through.I saw one reviewer complaining about the erotic affair between Ripley and Clemens. I think the type of their affair follows quite well with the character of Ripley. This is nothing like 'Gone with the wind' or anything. It is not a big part of the plot, but it makes the character of Mr. Clemens more interesting. I will really recommend people, not liking this movie the first time, to give it a second chance (or third etc.) Once again Weaver is great as Ripley, taking charge. The end of the movie is OK but the 'return' of Bishop is a little lame and unnecessary./brian",8,4,51,28 December 2008
Alien: Resurrection," Not the ideal combination
","I love the Alien series.I love Jeunet films.The choice of actors and some of the scenery etc. is very clearly Jeunet. Weaver is great (as always) but this is not an ideal combination though. The plot with recreating Ripley from a stain of blood and then just accept that she has some remnant memory of things from her previous version turns my enthusiasm off.It is not a bad movie, but it doesn't measure with the first 3 films. I was thinking: Alien meets 'The Fly 2'. A little silly...If you want to see some Jeunet films, take a look at Delicatessen and City of Lost Children. If you want to see the best Alien films, take a look at the first 3 films./brian",6,0,0,28 December 2008
