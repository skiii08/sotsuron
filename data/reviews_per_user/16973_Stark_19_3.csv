Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Absolutely useless
","I only watched it because I watched the first one and I am kind of a collector ( I just wanted to add it to my watched list ). Well, I hated the first one. The second one, extremely predictable with just a little bit of attention and again boring. How possible is that she didn't even suspected that she had a daughter but instantly believe she has one when seeing a child with Bill!! I just don't get it, did Bill know that its his child before trying to kill her? Because if yes, why shoot her in the head? why kill his daughter? If not, how did he know? He realized when he heard 'it's your b...'? Now, that's the worst explanation. I mean, the characters' motivations are absurd! And yes, a lot of clich√©s! Intentional, unintentional, the result is just boring! I fail to understand why the movie is highly rated! Last thing, every second in the movie, I hate her more. I don't even find her attractive ( while being a rather blond type ).",3,1,3,20 April 2016
Citizen Kane," What a deception
","I watch a lot of movies, and every now and then I watch one of the classics, or you can call them old movies.
The day before I watched Witness for the Prosecution. I am familiar with Agatha Christie's work, so I wasn't deceived.
Today, I told myself Citizen Kane should be the one I should be watching in this Sunday night.
The first fifteen minutes I stopped watching and went to grab something to eat. I said to myself, this movie looks boring, I don't think I like it, however I will give it a chance. Never a classic have failed me!
Well not his one.
I really tried to enjoy it, but couldn't!
It was simply a description of the life of an 'ordinary' man. Nothing particular at all.
Ordinary does not oppose to rich or important. I mean his life wasn't particular. I am amazed how one managed to create a movie out of it.
The whole movie tries to give importance to this man's life, but failed. Even the mysterious last word was for me an attempt to make this person important, but it also failed.I saw that some people talk about how good the cinematography is in this movie. If the plot fails you, no cinematography in the world will save you.I am really deceived.",1,3,9,4 August 2019
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Boring, Predictable...
","Seeing the rating, I was expecting a good movie. However, just a few minutes into the movie, I got bored. I knew that she will kill them all, that she will be super powerful although I don't know why (in a sarcastic/rhetoric way). For those who say that the sword is her source of powerful, I can say she managed even without it. In addition, she have the 'auto-healing' option. She can be cut deeply, but just give her a few seconds, she will be stronger. Even the fights are boring. I extremely enjoy fights (Check 'Kingsman'),I have no problem with violence and blood. Still, I even skipped the most parts of the final 'fights'. ( I skip very rarely ) I almost get attached to all characters except her. No story whatsoever. And why would she assume that her kid isn't alive? she didn't even asked. I wasn't surprised by the last information in the movie. Someone killed in a hospital, 13 hours later, no one found out. Few months later, no one said where is the patient ( and check the country entrances and exits ) and no one bothered about Buck's car. Oh yeah, his car is invisible, just an ordinary one! A katana cut be another is rather I don't know! ( I have a katana, well I used to, when confiscated by the customs service ).",4,3,5,4 March 2016
