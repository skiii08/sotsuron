The Longest Yard," an average sports movie
","i'm a fan of football and living in Texas its a great passion of mine and a lot of the people who live here. I used to really enjoy watching my local high school and my brother's college football teams play. sure they weren't that good but it was about team spirit that kept them alive. his college's team gets to lower bowl games but that is about all they do and my high school made it to the playoffs in the 2nd round but then lost horribly. yet still it was fun and even though I was in marching band I still love to watch football. I also had cool friends who played on the local high school varsity football team.naturally, i was hoping for a good football film. this film starts out with a chase where Adam Sander is chased for stealing his girlfriend's car. he acts funny toward the cops making fun of them which I found hilarious and then later he totals her car. he is then sent to prison disgraced after a point shaved incident where he will be forced to play a game. Chris rock wises him up so that he doesn't become one of the prisoner's women. they have a hard time finding people at first to join the team which is very difficult but after Adam Sander plays basketball and the basketball players find out how racist the prison guards are they decide to join him. There is a sad moment in this film before it really builds up to the big game. two characters in particular the guy playing ping-pong and of course Michael Irvan's character are athletic in this one. Adam Sandler seems a bit of a stretch for professional football seeing as he never considered playing but still the movie has its moments which I laughed at. even though I still like this movie I think a better football movie to check out is Friday Night Lights.Pros Of This Film-Chris rock being funny-the players who actually looked like they could be football players-good film for football crazed fans-not a good film but you could still enjoy itCons Of This Film-predictable ending (from the game on)-Adam Sander as quarterback (burt Reynolds younger was better)-hollywood remake not as good as the older the longest yard-not the most intelligent film",7,0,2,19 June 2005
Madagascar," Dreamworks has lost it
","Dreamworks has lost what they had with the Shrek movies. That is the charm and fun that they had. This film is a dry film with nothing really to show for it. Madagascar takes place in Manhatten where our main characters are. Alex, a ridiculous looking friendly lion is shown doing some lame show in the beginning. The jokes are just awful in this film. I maybe laughed once during this film which is sad considering this is supposed to be a comedy animated film. Chris rock who I expect to be really funny is not here and I recommend people to see the other film he is in over this one. The other characters are even lamer such as a boring hippo girl Gloria and a dumb Giraffe named Melvin. This giraffe even thought when he got to the wild that he was in San Diego. Hello, its really obvious that is not San Diego. The idea of penguins taking over a ship going to Antarctica and then wanting to leave is just absurd. It's A Wonderful World has been used in way too many movies but yet again its in this film and this film isn't even worthy enough to have this song. I feel sorry for Louis Armstrong in that respect.Pros Of This Film-length (its over quick so I don't have to suffer anymore)-not as bad as Dreamwork's last film although that really doesn't say much. -good animationCons of This Film-lack of a good plot-terrible ending-lame characters-loses its direction-not very funnyBottomline: Don't Waste Your Money on this at the theater if you haven't seen it just wait for it to come out on DVD instead for a rental or wait for it to air on TV.",6,1,2,19 June 2005
Batman Begins," batman rocks
",this was flat out the best batman movie i've seen. the batman film from 1989 does not trail too far behind as it was good also. the acting is wonderful. Christian Bale does a great job playing batman. The story is interesting. There are a lot of evil crooks in Gotham including one that sprays poison. Batman has to save Gotham City in this one in order to be a superhero. In the beginning it starts out with him as a kid and shows how he got his fear of bats. Later he knows how to deal with that fear and no longer fears them. Morgan Freeman in this movie is the character Lucius Fox. Lucius Fox is the guy that gives batman his suit and a bad ass vehicle that the cops call a tank. Bruce Wayne of course wants that vehicle in black. The vehicle doesn't look like it did in the later batman films in the story as it is an early version of the bat-mobile. Trust me this is a movie you won't regret seeing as it is this year's comic film to see. it's about time i didn't see an awful rendition of batman like batman vs. robin which made me want to leave the theater so bad and I felt like I had lost the time out of my life after that. This film I actually felt rewarded and it kept me interested the entire time.pros of this film-cool looking bat suit & car-interesting story that does the comics justice-good acting-does not stray off -batman actually is like batman-leaves us wanting morecons of this film-rachel's philosophy on justice (you would try to get revenge too if your parents died and the killer was going to be set free)conclusion: watch this film I don't promise you will like it at the level I did but this is one film you don't want to miss this summer which has only really had three of these now.,10,1,2,19 June 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," When Vader Was Born
","Here comes another Star Wars prequel. I didn't expect much then heard all of these good reviews on this film so I had to go see it. I'm not really that big of a star wars fans. I mean I watch the movies but I don't go to any conventions. This prequel was decent and I have seen this film twice. The action scenes were well done but this movie really suffers on the dialog. The movie also has a big error where Anakin Skywalker turns to the dark side which is shown differently in the film twice. However, the good thing is there is less dialog in this film compared to Attack Of The Clones.The musical score fits the movie well. Unfortunately, I found myself wanting Anakin to get to the dark side quicker so it would explore more of the events that could of occurred between Episode III & Episode IV. The Chancellor Palpatine is very good at being evil and swaying Anakin over to the dark side even though the Jedi try to keep him from doing so.Pros of Star Wars Episode III-Great Action Scenes-Great Musical Score-Great Story-Great VisualsCons Of Star Wars Episode III-Dialogue was weak-mediocre acting-less suspense (for people who have seen A New Hope)Bottomline: Everyone has seen this film but just in case you haven't please go see this film and this will definitely be a buy on DVD.",9,2,5,19 June 2005
