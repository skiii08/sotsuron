Your Name.," Not a fan of romantic movie, but I simply just love this!
","I don't normally review a movie, in fact this will be my first time. The reason that I needed to make one because I was astonished with something that I just watched, and I feel that people need to watch it too.Great story line with twists here and there, great characters and development, supported by excellent animation and music.I came to the cinema with the expectation of this movie would be as good as 5 cm per second, in fact it surpassed my expectation. I could not even remember when was the last time I watch a movie without checking my watch, which means that every single minutes, from beginning till the end, the scenes were very enjoyable and well fit in to the whole flow of the story.This movie also reminded that how great Japanese movies in Asia were before Korean movies started coming to scene. Honestly speaking Japanese animate will still be my number one pick when it comes to animation.In conclusion, this is a must watch for everybody, whether you like anime or not. Highly recommended!",10,11,18,19 November 2016
