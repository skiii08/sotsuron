Sucker Punch," Most underrated film of 2011
","After seeing the movie for the first time at home on Blu-Ray, I had to wonder where all the bad reviews were coming from?  Old, crotchety, prudish Zombie clones?  Maybe lacking in crisp dialogue but the visual, cinematography, and feast of stylized color and techno driven soundtrack of pure opiate induced euphoria should've been enough for any objective 'critic'.  Which is why I never listen to a movie critic when they can give 4 stars and rave reviews to 'The Kings Speech' which was as well acted boring movie.  Then take a deuce on 'SuckeR PuncH' when it at the very least was original and down right cool to look at.  Then again, these same critics/voters snubbed the Best Director around right now and his movie at The Oscars® this year(Chris Nolan & 'Inception').  Do yourself a favor and buy Sucker Punch on Blu-Ray or DVD with the Unrated Directors Cut and you will be thoroughly satisfied.",8,1,3,14 August 2011
