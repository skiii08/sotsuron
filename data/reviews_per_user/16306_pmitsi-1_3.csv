Angels & Demons," Surprisingly good!
","I went to see A & D mostly because I had read the book and I was curious to watch it on big screen (also, from the trailer I saw that Tom Hanks dismissed that hideous haircut he had in Da Vinci Code, DVC :). I didn't expect something particularly good and so I could not be disappointed.I was surprised to see that A & D is a far better movie than DVC, with a faster and a better binded plot, reasonable good supporting performances and a script that does not lose itself in the process (e.g. trying to tie together a lot of loose ends). Is a more focused film and so, even if the A & D book (or Illuminatti) was inferior to DVC book, its film adaptation is much better.It is a good fast pacing adventure and mystery film with a very good cast (the only unknown was the leading lady :P) and a very good plot. Don't get into the trap of comparing the book with the film. THERE ARE CHANGES but this was expected, wasn't it? Rent and enjoy it...",8,1,2,22 May 2009
The Wrestler," Very Original Boxing Drama
","One very original film and a smashing comeback for the Rourke. It avoids all the clich√© created in boxing stories and instead it proposes its own, a more realistic approach in the theme of aging used-to-be-big boxers. The end off course will leave a bitter taste in the mouth, but hey this is real life! Rourke and Tomey are excellent in their performances, as were the actors playing his daughter and the prickly supermarket supervisor. The Christ/Boxer parallelization of Tome's character was an excellent plot devise since it gives some depth in her character, gives us a streetwise approach in religion. Yes, in many ways Christ should be very respected to the wrestling world. He took it all and did not complaint!",Null,0,1,22 May 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," A fantastic conclusion to an epic series
","A fantastic conclusion to an epic series... As a critic said, watching the HP films was like watching a hurdles runner that falls down several times during the race but ends up winner at the end!!! In the last film, many many innocent and 'clear' images from the first film are reversed (Hodguarts, Central Station, etc) and many characters are transformed as the story reaches its darkest twist and all the secrets are out...Watching it also showed that was a very wise move to break the last book into 2 films. Part 1 was a road movie, a running adventure, while Part 2 is about an epic and long anticipated battle. I haven't read not even one from the HP books, but I did watched all the movies. However, I believe that one could watch and enjoy this film even if he or she has not seen all the previous ones. This may actually be a good excuse for anyone to watch the whole series again or for the first time...",Null,0,0,1 August 2011
