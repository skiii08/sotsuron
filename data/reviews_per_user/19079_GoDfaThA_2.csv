The Blair Witch Project," The Blair Witch Project huh??
","Ok i knew beforehand this wasn't going to be an effects filled movies like Star Wars: Episode1, unlike a few of my friends expecting your run of the mill slasher flick( dont ask why ) Now back to the movie.While This movie has a very Very eerie feel to it because its all point of view filming, if you know what that is, it also has a lot of talking is in todays movies is not seen.Maybe instead of having all the talking it could have had maybe a few different angles like through the ' witche's ' eyes, it may have help a few scenes, but the rest is good the way it is.The beginning is not really scary at all, unless you can't stand swearing, but around the middle it picks up and starts getting freaky.Im not going to spoil anything for those 5 or 6 people on the planet who haven't seen this movie maybe a few more, The ending is so way out of left field, its almost a bad idea. Although Im pretty sure I know what happens at the end its still be debatable, what is Mike doing in the corner? Who's hand prints were on the wall? Was that a furnace on the floor?If you want special effects rent a Sci-Fi movie, if you want more gore then get a real slasher/splatter movie,  but if you want a very very very eerie movie with an ending with a real big, huge, gi-mungus( is that a word? ), gigantic twist get this movieOverall I give this movie on a scale of 1 to 10 a 8 1/2.",Null,0,1,29 December 1999
Army of Darkness," First you want to kill me, now you wanna kiss me. Blow.
","Army of Darkness, what can you say about it that hasn't been said? Not much. It's definitely a kick-ass horror-action-comedy. Yes Bruce Campbell is the King, and can make even laying the smack down on one's self look hilarious. It's just too bad no one in Hollywood takes him seriously (FOOLS!), because all he ever gets is really to work with Raimi.If your looking for blood, guts, gore, continuity... look elsewhere. The Evil Dead series has never been keen on continuity, and this doesn't do a whole lot for trying to make up lots of ground in that department.It does however stand on it's own two feet in superb fashion. One-liners galore, guns that can fire 3 to 4 times what they could (normally) hold, stop motion skeletons, that look good moderately good, and Ash.The original 'Planet of the Apes' style ending, would actually make for a good sequel, while the 'S-mart ending' brings things closer to a close, but still leave things open enough for a convoy to pass through.",Null,1,1,3 October 2000
