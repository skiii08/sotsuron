Ford v Ferrari," I mean I guess ...
","This was a good sports movie . I won't watch it again and I won't be recommending it out .I like the underdog story , the relationship of miles to his family as well as miles to Shelby . I was captivated most of the movie , found it visually appealing . The story itself is Inherently interesting and I learned quite a bit on a topic I knew very little about .I didn't feel deeply based on the cinematic elements .. I didn't leave with any specific moment or quote that I can take home and say ' that applies to me ' no fantastic scenes .. good acting but nothing mind blowing . I found it to be entertaining . The acting was good. I left without inspiration to do or change anything specific .it was too long with too many driving scens.Overall I would say to watch but it didn't deserve a picture of the year nomination. It's a quality picture but will lot change your life :)",7,0,0,15 February 2020
Knives Out," Politics in film is a good thing .. this film was bad
","Overall I didn't like the feel , the character development ... the detective .. the puking ... the plot ... it was visually appealing in some ways... and the twist was interesting .. it had a lot of potential but in the end fell way short .Many people are complaining it had a political message .. it did have one and one I happen to agree strongly with . I loved how Marta was referred to from so many different countries .. no one really knew or cared they knew she was Latin this was her one thing they all mentioned at some point throughout the film. The way that was woven in was brilliant. The threat of deportation.. a privileged white guy being the antagonist in the end . All very well done and proving a point I stand strongly behind .. immigrants .. legal or not .. come here for a reason and want to protect their families just like the rest of us and we should be way more empathetic to that plight . Film makers have a responsibility to build in messages of importance , movies are not just for entertainment they should make us think , make us feel , make us question and research . Even if a movie has an opposing viewpoint I stand by that sentiment . This moved it up from a 1 to a 4.I didn't enjoy it , I would not recommend it and it felt juvenile . I really don't understand how this got an 8.",4,4,10,6 March 2020
The Piano," This movie is the literal worst.
","I love movies. I love foreign film, dark film, artistic film, different film. This TRIED to have all of those elements but failed in every aspect. It was boring, you felt little or no empathy for any of the characters, Ada was a weak person. Her daughter was a total brat. Both men were filthy, she fell in love with a man that physically assaulted her? That makes no sense- maybe if she had actually taught him piano I could see how that could happen, There is not one redeeming lesson or moral, she does not choose anything for herself, and after all that she gets rid of the piano? I can go on and on. This is 2 hours long, and I HARDLY EVER check my phone during a movie, or get up without pausing it. I was looking for reasons to get up and check my phone. There are SO MANY GREAT FILMS- do not waste time on this one.",1,4,8,10 August 2018
Midsommar," This was just...bad
","I love horror. I love disturbing. I love indie film.This was all of those things, and not really anything more. It was disturbing and gross without any point, it did not need to be over 2 hours, it did not need the mating ritual to take 15 min, it did not need to have dead bodies all over the place, it did not need to show the smashing of the head with a sledgehammer or the smattering of blood after the apparent suicide. The same effect would have been created by the suicide itself, alluding to the fact the the mating was happening, implying the bodies were around(the foot was a nice touch, up out of the garden). That would have added to the horror, the mystery and the feel.I understand the appeal, a light colored movie with a dark theme, a time when light is most apparent leading to the most dark, the fact Americans impose their own values everywhere they go, without seeking to really understand and they therefore miss out. Its a good start, a good idea, with absolutely no follow through.I left feeling angry, disgusted and disappointed in a movie I had looked forward to for some time.So many good movies out there, spend your time on something else.",1,235,408,20 October 2019
Joker," Intense
",This was a brilliantly made and very very powerful film . I actually felt sick at the end .. it causes me to think .. evaluate about things that are not easy or comfortable . It caused me to feel things that are not pleasant. If you are watching for entertainment only you might be out of luck .This really highlights those marginalized by society .. the issue with mental health care and the lack of kindness in an unkind world. The acting was amazing .. the aesthetics captivating . I love dark and disturbing and substance and this movie has all 3. My husband and I have spent many hours discussing both the movie and different issues it highlights since we finished .. which is part of the power of great film.,9,0,0,29 January 2020
Parasite," mixed genre
",This whole film reminded me of '10 clover field lane ' . It starts out and you think you know where it's going .. 5 turns and 5 wrong conclusions later there you are at the end still wondering if you got it right .It didn't feel forced or silly .. it was powerful .. edge of your seat .. wanting to know what happens next all at the same time causing you to look introspectively within yourself in situations where you are the 'parasite ' or someone is to you .Great acting .. great plot .. great twists . Worth the time . Honestly if I went in with lower expectations it would have been a 9 I was just expecting so much it was hard to surpass that .. but would highly recommend to anyone .,8,8,11,1 February 2020
Marriage Story," Powerful because we have all seen it
",More than the movie itself what I took from the movie was the feeling it gave me and left me with . In today's world we are either divorced .. have divorced parents .. have a divorced sibling or at the very least a close friend . We have seen what divorce does and how it brings out the absolute worst in everyone involved .This movie drew on that .. not through cheap tricks .. but through raw emotion that we have either felt or been witness too. This movie is long .. it's a bit slow at times .. not particularly ' entertaining ' in the classic way .. but it draws emotion out of you and helps you see a world that isn't fair .. and that can be cruel .. and we know that to be reality .,8,10,15,29 January 2020
Jojo Rabbit," Incredibly powerful
","I have now seen the movie twice. I watched it solo on friday and again today with my husband. I loved it the first time but even more so the second time, I was able to capture more of the brilliant dialogue and nuances. This made me laugh(which is amazing based on the subject matter, it made me feel sick and it made me cry and rejoice for the goodness of human kind all in the space of 1 hour and 45 min.The acting by Mckenzie was INCREDIBLE and by far one of my favorite movie characters of all time. She was able to be strong and vulnerable at the same time. She was incredibly authentic.I think my main take from the movie is summed up in one of the best lines, when Rosie and Jojo are looking at the recently hanged people in the street he asks her 'what did they do?' and she replies 'what they could'. So much power in this, and he later states it to himself when the war ends. We all can do a little to end hate, to be our best selves, to improve the world around us and dance because we are free.Highly suggest watching this. I recognize its a hard topic to have comedy and satire, but recognizing the director is of Jewish heritage helps this sentiment a lot. I also am a Jew and found this to be a great take and shows how tragic it ways and horrendous through a new lens.",10,0,0,17 February 2020
