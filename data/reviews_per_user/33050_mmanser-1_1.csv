Requiem for a Dream," Aronofsky's Genius Film
","David Aronofsky is one of the most experimental filmmakers of our time. With films like Pi, Aronofsky helps us to discover new things with film-making. Requiem for a dream is a genius film of drug use and erotic obsession. It's a brutally honest film that dives into the deepest dwellings of your consciousness and opens your mind to new and extraordinary things.The feel of the film is a mixture of slow and fast. The random jump cuts can often be confusing and many of the cutting sequences, mostly those that are focusing on drug use, are very rapid and appear very often in the flow of the story.Aronofsky is a true visionary in a time of followers. He is doing something different and exclusive that is truly his own image and his own style. Though not for everyone, Requiem for a Dream is definitely a great start to look at a truly great mind.",10,0,1,8 December 2004
