"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Entertainment is underrated
","Now let's not get technical here. We are not looking at a complex work of art, or a movie with lofty Oscar pretensions, the title alone gives that much away. No. Rather, we are talking about a clean, simple package of fun, neatly wrapped and competently delivered by director David Schwimmer, who comfortably (i'm tempted to say expertly, but i'm not sure it was intentional) provides an American flavour to what is essentially a British farcical comedy and it works very, very well.....sort of Four Weddings meets There's Something About Mary and has a lovechild.Mind you, DS did have some help. Simon Pegg must be, by a country mile, the best comedy actor out of the UK at the moment. Hank Azaria is so flexible it's untrue and, for me, his portrayal of an obnoxious 'Mr. Perfect' was the key to where our sympathies lay throughout the entire movie and he nailed it spot on. Then there was the support of the forever-laconic Dylan Moran who provides his usual laid back delivery to some of the best lines in the film. Add to all this a host of cameos from some of the best that British comedy has to offer at the moment and it was hard to fail.Altogether, this is great, heartwarming fun and 90 minutes of pure, unpretentious entertainment that is well worth the entrance fee. Highly recommended.but if you are still undecided, then you must try it for no other reason than the performance of Harish Patel as Pegg's landlord, Mr.Ghoshdashtidar. Every scene with him and Pegg is a delight and guaranteed to put a smile on your face. Go see what I mean.",8,3,6,28 February 2008
Gettysburg," questions answered?
","OK, I'm British, let's get that out of the way. The American Civil War has fascinated me for many years for many different reasons - almost everything about it was/is unique or unparallelled in the history of warfare and it's sheer significance on a bewildering number of levels is staggering - but the one most important question that I am still trying to come to terms with is this; what was it that drove men, from both sides, to advance toward near-certain death - time after time - against fellow countrymen on such a vast scale? I have watched this movie only recently (amazingly enough) and I want to pick up on an element that most IMDb reviewers have dismissed or generally commented as being a negative aspect. There are many scenes of protracted dialogue between the fight-scenes that attempt to put the war, the motives, the higher principles, the morality etc from all sides into perspective and I was very thankful for that. I can understand that for some it may have detracted from their overall enjoyment of the movie by giving it uneven pacing and contributing significantly to the running time of over 4 hours, but not for me. Just like for the many thousands of men who fought in this war, the interludes between fighting must have been a time of reflection and reaffirmation of their cause and their own personal motives in the light of the horrors that they had just endured. I saw this as an element of the movie every bit as realistic as the battles themselves and so it enhanced my enjoyment overall.Overall, as a movie?. I am no expert in 'movie engineering' such as the cinematography, editing and so on, I can only comment on the end product whose only objective (surely) is to entertain. I can say that I was entertained to such an extent that I was drawn right in. I was there. Sheen, Beringer, Daniels etc. were not actors, but the actual people they were portraying and I was right there with them, a little like the British observer from the Coldstream Guards. Which brings me to the only reason why I could not give the movie 10 out of 10. Whose idea of a typical British officer was that? It was embarrassing (drinking tea from a china cup in the middle of the Confererate lines - perleeeaase!) to such an extent that I squirmed every time he had a line to say (I was reminded of good old Dick Van Dyke as a British chimney sweep - a travesty of a caricature). And I did notice that he was the only one to flinch when artillery exploded nearby, whilst all else appeared not to notice and remained erect, statuesque and gazing into the opposite horizon. I can only guess at the reason for this and it is unworthy of the nobility of the events being portrayed.Did the movie answer my question? I would say yes, in part. But I came to the conclusion that no matter how much I learn about this incredible event in world history, a full understanding will always remain tantalisingly out of my grasp. Because, simply, I am not a product of its happening.",8,3,4,29 March 2006
P.S. I Love You," I'm a bloke....I don't cry...sniff!
","I always have trouble sleeping on planes, so on a recent long haul to Singapore (particularly as I had the misfortune to be seated next to the worlds most flatulent woman) I decided to check out the movies and pick one that appeared deadly dull and slumber inducing. Casting my eye down the play list (damn, no BloodRayne) PS I love You seemed to fit the bill nicely. Guaranteed chick-flick-coma material.Congratulating myself on this master plan, I donned the earphones and blanket, turned my shoulder from Methane Woman and snuggled down for a good 90 minutes kip.Not a hope! From the outset I was enthralled, then amused, then sad, then happy, then sad again, as the movie gripped my emotions for a ride every bit as turbulent as my travelling companions trousers.Great story, delivered by a surprising mix of actors, which tugged and tore at the heart strings...poked and prodded the funny bone...teased and tormented the intellect, all with deadly accuracy and impeccable timing, toward an ultimately bitter-sweet finale.When it was over, there was a little tightness in my throat, a touch of a sniffle in my nose and, yes, the swell of a tear in my eye....if that woman doesn't stop soon I'll be dead before Singapore.",9,1,2,16 April 2008
Amadeus," Salieri does not hate Mozart.
","First of all, let me say that Amadeus is as flawless a movie as I have ever seen, with probably the finest acting job in motion picture history in F.Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri. It is a delight for the eyes, for the ears and the heart from beginning to end. But I am only repeating most reviewer's comments in saying this. What I wanted to pick up on is that time after time I read in the reviews of Salieri's hatred for Mozart....but this could not be further from the truth. Salieri is consumed with hatred, that much is true, but not for Mozart, rather for himself and a fickle God. He hates himself when realising in his heart that he will only ever be mediocre and God who should mock his mediocrity by bestowing the very gifts that he had coveted (genius and popularity)in the form of a crude and childlike person such as Mozart.I ask all of you who have described Salieri's hatred for Mozart to watch the movie again and consider the truth..... Here are the things to look out for;Salieri never appears angry when listening to, or reading Mozart's music, quite the opposite. He sees and hears only beauty - even the voice-over confirms this. Watch Salieri's eyes and facial expressions whenever he is talking directly to Mozart. Often we see adoration, awe, even love - and sometimes coyish embarrassment....but never hatred...never anger. Even when Salieri is trying to kill Mozart (to spite God and to appease his hatred of himself) his eyes can only offer pain and love. Watch what happens when Mozart collapses near the end of the movie. If Salieri really hated Mozart could he be so gentle and caring? And when he helps Mozart to complete his Requiem on his deathbed, every mannerism and gesture of Salieri speaks only of admiration and adoration. If Salieri had truly hated Mozart he would have been joyful at the success of his scheme. Finally, when Mozart is buried in a paupers grave - there is no sign of Salieri's joy at finally dispatching a great and hated rival. His demeanour speaks a very complex language of sadness mixed with uncertainty, doubt and self-loathing.Watch the movie again and you will see why I said earlier that F Murray Abraham's acting job was the finest I have ever seen, because the subtlety of his gestures, the silent emotions etched in his face and his eyes all bear witness to the truth. Salieri adored, and maybe even loved, Mozart.",10,3,6,22 April 2006
The Holiday," Do yourself a favour....go see it.
","I find it extremely difficult to comprehend how anyone can watch an engineered piece of seasonal fantasy such as this, then dash to their nearest PC and delight in penning a negative comment. These must be the same people who believe the moon landing was shot in an Arizona lock-up, or that Elvis Presley is alive and living in a cave in Bulgaria. Despite all the evidence before their eyes, they refuse to just accept the probable and search for a microbe of inconsistency upon which to proffer the improbable.Is this movie predictable? Of course it is. Is this movie a little contrived? You bet. Are some performances stronger than others? As always, yes. Does it represent English/U.S. reality? Not a chance. Would Kate Winslett ever consider getting it on with Jack Black? I seriously doubt it. Is Cameron Diaz's smile widely annoying? Oh yes. Is this movie a classy piece of seasonal escapism that makes you want to hug the nearest bad guy? Yes it is.Despite the many minor flaws (if that is the right word) this movie achieves what it set out to do, which is to provide a thick slice of non-challenging, non-threatening Christmas feel-good fare. So don't be like the Elvis spotters and count the calories, or complain about the trans-fats....just dive in and devour the whole thing....you know you want to.",9,4,5,11 December 2007
300," I make this review...FOR SPARTA!!!
","WOW!! Is this movie a testosterone junkies fix or what?!!? I gotta say that I came striding out of this movie firm of jaw and broad of chest looking for a little guy to beat up on....for SPARTA!!! Not finding one of suitable proportions I marched off home (stiff and upright of course) and roared at my wife to get my supper ready....for SPARTA!!! Once I had brushed all of the bolognese sauce out of my hair, I sat down to reflect on the movie I had just seen.I was attracted by three things. Firstly, the 60's movie 'The 300 Spartans' is on my top 10 favourite movie list and secondly the trailer for 300 looked great, promising to give a Lord of the Rings feel to essentially the same historical storyline. Added to that the same team provided me with my favourite movie of recent years, Sin City. So how could I not enjoy this movie!?! On the plus side. 300 is a non-stop feast for the senses, even though it is possible to over-indulge. The CGI is amazing, the comic-book feel is a delight, the battle scenes magnificently choreographed (I use this word because the battles were unusually dance-like) and the music score is supremely empowering without being imposing. The fantasy element a la LotR did not disappoint either.All in all a very good nights entertainment.....however....very reluctantly (because I so much wanted this movie to be flawless) I feel compelled to mention a few gripes......Even though there are one or two significant scenes with women, this is so overpoweringly a mans movie that they fail to redress the balance. Now this does not mean it cannot be enjoyed by women, but rather that its main appeal (intentionally or otherwise)is to a largely bygone male stereotype. Hence my reversion to Neanderthal Man as I left the theatre.Next, and I gotta say it, the whole 'FOR SPARTA!!!' thing was just a little OTT. By far the most dominant of the 300 Spartans was of course King Leonidas and his men followed him blindly, but wasn't he a little barking mad? That whole 'tonight we dine in hell' thing certainly would have had me pondering whether he was one sandwich short of a picnic.In essence, King Leonidas' going totally tonto in isolation would not have been noticed, but when the, shall we say 'idiosyncrasies', of some of the other Spartans are added, then some parts drifted dangerously toward a Monty Python sketch. Sorry.And finally in my little gripette. The most interesting character in this movie, by a country mile, is Xerxes, but far too little development time was given over to him. If I were Frank Miller, I'd already be outlining a sequel...'300, the rise and fall of the return of Xerxes rides again'. Guaranteed money-spinner.Anyway, taken as a complete package, well worth the entrance fee and a welcome injection of testosterone.....I wonder if the wife has calmed down.....time for a little horizontal refreshment....FOR SPARTA!!!!!",6,5,11,29 March 2007
Sin City," Just like watching the comic book come to life!!
","Brilliant, just brilliant!!!I remember reading somewhere that there was no real script to speak of, just the original frames from the comic books. It shows.. and it is this which makes the movie such a wonderful experience. Think about it. 1. A comic book has only still pictures and therefore there are certain styles of drawing required in order to portray movement, depth, action, which by necessity must appear exaggerated. There were many such shots in this movie that copied these exaggerated styles into film and the effect was awesome (particularly when characters were running). 2. Also, in a comic book there is only so much space for speech bubbles, therefore dialogue must be brief, stinted and straight to the point. In the movie this was wonderfully recreated. Many scenes of dialogue comprised just one-liners going back and forth...perfectly recreating the comic book experience. I have read in some reviewers comments that they feel the acting was sometimes poor and put it down to the script - completely missing the point. 3. More subtly, have you ever noticed in comic books that static (often background)characters never stand straight, upright and facing the reader directly? This would never work. Always, characters are portrayed from unusual angles, striking exaggerated poses. In the movie you will see many examples of this, (note particularly some of the shots with the hookers standing around, and the car thieves when discussing their marks) I am certain that if you did not notice this, it will subtly have added to your enjoyment. 4. Finally, in a comic book you will never find scenes remaining in the same place for long. It is necessary for the comic to remain dynamic and exciting to keep the action moving. This is why almost all such genre comics have the following sequence (or similar); Location shot: Short dialogue: action: leave: fast car: new location shot: short dialogue: action: leave: fast car.....and so on. Watch the movie again to see what I mean.All of the above (with a few less easy to explain) added enormously to a moving comic book experience and was all intentional I'm sure. As I said before, brilliant!!",9,7,11,30 March 2006
