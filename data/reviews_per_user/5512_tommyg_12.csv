Angels & Demons," The movie went nowhere
","I was not quite mad for paying Senior Citizen rates, but I was disappointed that the film went nowhere that was innovative or creative or whatever.That button was never pressed in my brain.This movie was made for a person who has never attended a movie showing either on DVD or in a movie theater.I was grabbed by title.The titled did not deliver.Do not pay admission for a viewing. Wait for the DVD rental for one dollar",6,1,6,16 May 2009
Chinatown," Great After Three Decades
","I just experienced my first screening of Chinatown in the same town that was featured in a portion of the action: San Pedro, CA and not that far from Chinatown Los Angeles.I was totally captured and raptured in this belated viewing.A week ago, I viewed John Sayles 'Silver City' and it seems that little has changed when one tells a story of local political corruption and payoffs by folks who move real estate and corporate sales in the name of progress -- with the taxpayer billed for progress through tax assessments on their salaries and property.Both Silver City and Chinatown are great films.Being a resident of the Los Angeles metropolitan area from birth to schooling through a few professional careers, it is great entertainment to experience scenery and events that I have lived.",10,2,4,3 October 2004
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," I Must Now Read The C. S. Lewis Books
","I totally enjoyed this film, particularly since I knew very little about it. The splashy ad in the newspaper gave me the impression that it was more of a cartoon than its highly developed graphics animation with tight script and direction.The best of what could be said has already been accurately written by others. What I walked away with was desire to know more about C. S. Lewis along his other books and writings.There was a wonderful mixing of Western religious dogma, spiritualism, witchcraft and perhaps a tinge of voodoo or whatever. Perhaps there was a hint of at least one portal somewhere that connects other universes or realms that co-exist with our own -- the one that Adam and Eve acquired. Quite contemporary concepts, for sure.Lewis' creative writing definitely fits well in uniting into one platform the debate between Darwin and Intelligent Design theories. Combine those two, and we get 'The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' (2005). I mean there were enough variant animals and critters in this film to temper the flotation Noah's Ark.And we don't have to even ponder about these four children of Adam and Eve and how they would select their life-partners -- presuming they cannot mate with those on the other side due to genetic differences. After all, they have only six Hobson's choices between Peter (P), Edmund (E), Lucy (L) and Susan (S): L+E, L+P,P+E and S+L, P+E. Any of those are within the Combo Darwin and Intelligent Design offerings.Just a thought about a great cinematic experience.",8,5,7,10 December 2005
Snatch," A Wonderful Crime Farce
","Friday was another movie day,  sorta catch up to see the some of them before the awards, and specifically the Foreign films since I will be attending a symposium with the foreign film nominee directors/producers at the Academy two days before the big-time awards.SNATCH is not unique in the genre of farce story telling of gangsters stepping on other gangsters while pulling off independent schemes of getting their piece of the pie the easy way.  Well, the easy way is not that easy when independent plots converge on cops-and-robbers after many laughs of robbers-and-robbers that carries the film.  This is an oddly funny film once one tunes the ear to British country way of speaking.  What?  What did they say....?It is always nice to see a movie with a cast of actors who want to bubble to the top -- and clearly have their day in the roles in this movie.  Two actors were strangely placed.  First, Benicio Del Toro ('TRAFFIC') appears as Franky Four Fingers which was a distraction as I asked myself, 'Where do I know that person from???  My 30cent a gallon WATER store owner in Culver City?'   And then the star with bottom billing while giving his best performance in recent filmology, none other than Brad Pitt (One Punch' Mickey ONeil ).The planned snatching of a prized diamond only sets the stage for a strange and wonderful adventure in the English craving for good, innocent crime (s) that excels in complicity all things that would shock Sherlock plots.Just tune your ears, and don't worry about One Punch' Mickey ONeil.  Only his gypsy mobile home travellers can really enjoy his jokes and dialogue.",8,0,0,18 February 2001
Capote," Cold Blood Runs Through It
","When Truman Capote announces to his publisher that he has the title for his evolving book -- and its evolving format that would change forever how books are written -- an overarching theme is established that plays itself out in this screenplay writing. That theme: there are lots of cold blooded decisions that are made by lots of otherwise simple, nice folks in order to get a bit ahead of the game of navigating and manipulating life as it progresses day by day.We saw it in Capote, we saw it in the murderers, we saw it in the book publisher, we saw it the sheriff, we saw it in the jail system, and we saw it on how the state executes an execution and how the priest administers the last prayer before the execution without feeling or guilt.In Cold Blood. We all walk away from our own acts of violence however small, and simply justify them because it is only our job for which we get paid in a system that is bigger than any of the players.That is what I observed and carried way after watching CAPOTE yesterday.Viewing this film was a wonderful experience while AMPAS simmers in the background to make a decision in a week or so to judge a bumper crop of great films in all categories.I can hardly wait for: ENVELOPE PLEASE!",10,0,1,25 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Needs the skin cut by 1.5 hours
","So it opened today in Los Angeles; and it is Wednesday; and free popcorn day and I was asked if I would like to see the film in a very comfortable STADIUM SEAT theater, and by a very graphics/animation oriented person.My friend was the first to jokingly yell when the credits finally arrived and the house lights brightened: Where is my refund!  Others in the audience were also negatively bedazzled with the redundancy of graphics and evil/good themes and bad ogres that got in the way of substance -- which was truely there in the first half of the film where things could have been concluded.One can always tell a poorly edited or directed or writen film when the audience starts to take jabs about half-way through when the viewer's labor begins a transition into convulsions.  Not having read the book, everything was a new experience.  But still, it was too long and did not sustain the story and fantasy by disguising new monsters in different clothing when they attack the good guys.I suppose I should not have rented MOULIN ROUGE the day before when the DVD was released -- if I was to enjoy RINGS.  These two films perhaps have some underpinnings of similarity in terms of evil, good, and love and hate and conspiracy and 'get even' mentality'.  ROUGE wins; RINGS -- well, sucks.I apparently paid for the UNCUT version; well, it is time for the editors to trim the skin to 1.5 hours total.  Particularly is there will be sequential movies.",Null,0,0,19 December 2001
Spirited Away," Deja Vu Indulgence As Animation
","This is a film that one must see with as many friends as possible at the same time, then spend the next two hours picking it apart and then reassembling the parts back into its original flow  but with a clearer understanding of the moral and metaphors and parables that were visually acquired during the viewing.And then save the next day for a phone call or two to add another interpretive layer.The animation was, clearly, the most refreshing visuals I have seen in one film. I have not experienced an animation film that changed in dynamic fashion to fit the mood of the story.  There were simple sketches, or photographic quality renderings, or complex layers or angles of perspective -- all of which defined the animation itself as having a distinct personality in parallel and union with the story telling.FANTASTIC!!!The story was steeped in many notions:  (1) self-indulgence and its tendency to acquire more and more things in expanding greed and dependence on consumption of goods and services in some religious or patriotic fashion; (2) the growing power of those who run' or control an economic infrastructure or business; (3) the innocence of youth and coming of age while taking control of one's own life and future; (4) the loss of respect by youth towards their parents; and (5) the most obvious, a venture outside of our own dimension on Planet Earth into that of spiritual beings where there is a spirit or ghost for everything on earth from a Japanese radish to a green frog to a timid speck of black coal dust that is tasked with the heaviest chore to stoke power consumption by feeding chunks of coal into the furnace.I find the oddest thing in this whole post-viewing and writing experience is the fact that Disney acquired the rights to the film's distribution at some level outside of Japan when in fact the film itself smites the over expansion of theme parks (in Japan and elsewhere, I suppose) as over-indulgence in (American) corporate irresponsibility in the skimming of profits away from Japan and its residents and citizens.Hello, Mr. Déjà vu. How do you Due?",10,0,0,20 September 2002
No Country for Old Men," Perfect Story Telling
","Start to finish, this film was well crafted in its telling of a story. I knew little about the film or its creators, and that was to my betterment in enjoyment. It was like reading a book rather than viewing a movie.It was only when viewing the credits that I learned its history of who, where, and when in its production.To my surprise, the screening theater was almost filled with a mix of ages from senior citizens to younger avid movie goers.And most of us stayed to read the scrolling credits before exiting the movie house.",10,7,21,18 November 2007
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Fantastic Resume Entry
","Having just seen TIGER-DRAGON, I am sifting out the bits and pieces in my mind, particularly between the involvement of the film's writers with that of the director -- and where the creativity of this film is placed.  This is my first martial-arts type film, so I am no qualified critic in that genre other than saying it definitely has many excellently crafted surreal poetic moments in the ability to fly and escape.  Which is the theme or moral of the film:  take an 8am-to-5pm job or go over the hill on a whim or return from that hill to settle down and take a wife or lover.These comments are my very Western appreciation of this film - which is Ang Lee's forte from what I observe from past films (with my top vote going to THE ICE STORM which I think set the stage for AMERICAN BEAUTY's recent awards).There is nothing negative about this film.  It is NOT the best film this year, nor during the prior decade. It may be the BEST MARTIAL ARTS FILM.I think ANG LEE has provided these talents:1) Re-introducing English speaking/reading folks to FOREIGN LANGUAGE films and to use one's mind when viewing a film; 2) Blending Western familiarities (i.e. a Dodge City-type saloon brawls) with more subtle Eastern values of mystique and patience and honor. 3) Great editing and continuity along a fast-paced path (i.e. do not drink a DietCoke any time before your viewing if you anticipate a short visit to the restroom). 4) A fantastic initiation to Wu Xia swords and wizardry, if that is what was happening or tagged (I will start reading my second Harry Potter book tonight!!)Those are my thoughts.",7,0,0,21 December 2000
Stardust," Very Slow Development
","This film was ultimately enjoyable, but it took the first half of disjointed stuff to arrive into a smooth movement. Robert De Niro definitely saved the movie as his character developed and nailed substance to this otherwise mis-directed film.I will rent the film on DVD and cut and paste De Niro into a twenty minute enjoyment as an artistic remake of an otherwise long film The De Niro character erased any other of the actor's attempt to get an Oscar. In essence, a boring film was vaulted into a classic gay movie. Thank Godd for Hollywood!!!",7,4,9,12 August 2007
Million Dollar Baby," Lost In the dust
","I am truly on the fringe in even posting my reaction to this film since my reaction, enjoyment and assessment is in the one percent. I have read every review after my viewing and they all say the same words, as if they all got a handout before a screening and were nudged closer to the grander thoughts of Eastwood.Yes, I missed something in this minimalist script with minimalist direction with minimalist emotions in a minimalist development.I guess it was simply not my movie. We all have those experiences, I assume.The most distracting character was Danger Barch  that clown that other training boxers would want to kill and take out. Danger's presence not make sense either on the front side of the story or his later resurrection with some sort of immaculate redemption in having seen God and awarded a new nose without scars in the surrounding facial tissue. No emotion in my viewing.Morgan Freeman was simply Morgan Freeman. That is what he is good with and comfortable. No emotion in my viewing.Maggie Fitzgerald came on with a strong Texan drawl or whatever that did not fit the character and which soon disappeared. And we never know the comfort she gets from Southern boxing and taking out other females on the canvas. Did she hit a guy first and got her rocks off? Or was it a female that she jabbed and got a jolt of estrogen? Did she pounce on her mother? No clue. I was clueless once again.What did I miss? There are two parts what were good: (1) the fighting mano a mano (okay, I admit that I do no know the female equivalent in that male expression) with the ladies. (2) the moment upon delivering a house to the mother and family. At that moment, we know something about the family but not Maggie since there was conflict undisclosed. Two strong points in the movie. Later encounters with the family at the hospital were just stupid and predictable with poor acting messing it all up.What did I miss? Okay, now Maggie is in the hospital with some sort of spinal injury that requires assisted respiratory breathing tubes. Air is forced in the lungs and air is drawn out of the lungs where her normal breathing and speaking were bypassed. The machine pumped air in and the machine pulled air out.At no time during the visit of Frankie Dunn was Maggie's breath in talking disrupted between the mechanical uptake and outlet of air. She spoke perfect tomes to Frankie. Hey, just try talking while inhaling and exhaling --- you can to it!!! And your voice changes!!! Okay.How was Frankie Dunn able to get into a hospital late at night from an outside, unlocked door that leads directly to an Intensive Care unit??? We are now at the end of the film and at the Intensive or Critical Care unit. An attendant at the end of the hallway is going on a coffee break and all we see he her announcing here intent at a typical hospital counter in a small view setting.The attendant leaves and that is when Frankie pulls the plug on a Critical Care patient. We see the monitors slowly beeping into existence as we assume the same for Maggie. Blank. The patient-side monitors are dead as is Maggie.Now one must wonder at this point: is patient monitoring in Critical Care for the benefit of the patient to listen to the bleeps and blips of sounds? Or are those signals sent to a Critical Care central point where the coffee going nurse turned over monitoring responsibility to the unknown skilled care nurse beyond our view? Frankie walks down that long, dark hallway and exits a door that is open 7-24 at this hospital that holds about 20 other patients. Anybody can walk in that door and the hospital staff does not care.If Hilary Swank died that night in an unattended manner, what happened to those other 20 patients in need of care? Hmmmmvery stupid stuff.Or, perhaps this film was mapping at a local hospital in Los Angeles that is controversial at this moment. It is the King/Drew hospital in which the Los Angeles Times newspaper a few weeks ago exposed a setting that perhaps was presaged by Clint Eastwood hospital health care incompetence.But I doubt that his film was about King/Drew. Yet that is my closest interpretation of being lost in the dust.",Null,4,10,31 December 2004
Gangs of New York," Interesting History but HO-HUM Scorsese
","I found this film to be interesting -- or at least to the point of keeping me awake -- and very 'Hollywood' in its construction(s) and scripting. There was seldom anything new or especially creative, yet the film maintained a compulsion to mend and blend its quilt work patches of borrowed things from vintage film archives.  Perhaps that something old, something old technique was appropriate to some degree.  The cinematic use of the five point road intersections was indeed efficient and cost-effective.  We, the viewer, never thought that we left the back lot for more than two minutes.  The opening battle between the landed tribes was pure carnage, yet the snow on the ground was dyed Easter egg pink in a very few places which is probably accounted for in its subliminal religious message.  There was a grand leap of faith when Leonardo gets out of the orphanage and returns home.  At one point in his associating with his past, he returns to a deep underground cave to dig up a relic he buried as a youngster.  As fate has it, in the depths of Manhattan granite as he twists and turns down into the caverns dug from by human hands, he finds his relic under full light of a torch still burning on the wall  -- almost sixteen years later.   By God, there must be a God!  Leonardo's mortal wounds (aka Amsterdam Vallon) healed rather fast throughout the story than anybody else's (they were all rapid, actually) as did an ending scalding on the face with a white-hot iron knife -- which miraculously evolved into a mild tinge of color imperfection on the cheek as if kissed by the Hawaiian godds after too much sun on Waikiki (must have been in the DiCarprio contract, for sure).  There was one outstanding genius of director Scorsese at the end of the story but which was also borrowed from Hollywood archives.  Specifically, there is a battle between Amsterdam and Bill the Butcher similar to a showdown between two adversaries such as the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote or perhaps Pepe le Pew.  After much repeated carnage (ho-hum) our two adversaries find each other in a fog of bombs-a-bursting or something like that (i.e. stage fog) and there is nobody else on that battle area where previously there were many slain or injured people in this riotous venue.  The two of them are down to the last iota of energy, bloody as hell, and still wrestle it out the end.  It was probably also at High Noon or something then, too.  On this I connected.  I always enjoyed the Road Runner, Wile E. Coyote and Pepe le Pew. On the down side of this movie experience, I did walk away with the best part of the film -- which must have been within the content of the book or author who penned the story to begin with.  I walked away with a sense of history of New York City and perhaps other American towns when immigrants were poorly treated, as they became the bottom feeders in the American economy.  That message of power was powerfully evident as the films singular message and which carries forward to this day in both local and national politics in the United States.  (Tammany Hall was powerful from its 1789 inception as a benevolent association to mayoral campaigns forward into1950).  Scorsese accomplished to deliver history that we never learned in school.  American history always has a sanitized version until college and later. My task now is to validate the contents of the film since the script touches American history with some real names to trace and track during the era presented in this film.",5,1,2,22 December 2002
