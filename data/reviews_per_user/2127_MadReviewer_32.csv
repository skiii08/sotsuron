The Rock," A First-Rate Action Flick
","`The Rock' effortlessly achieves what most action movies can only dream about  it's paced so well, and has action scenes and characters so good, the weak spots in the story really don't matter.  Story quality is one of the major components behind making a good movie, but it's certainly not the only component, and `The Rock' demonstrates that to great effect.  With great direction from Michael Bay, and with outstanding performances from the cast (especially Ed Harris), what might've been a standard, mediocre film in other hands is instead a fantastic action movie.
The premise:  `The Rock', or Alcatraz, as it's more commonly known, is taken over by a bunch of military terrorists led by General Francis Hummel (Ed Harris), an American war hero.  Instead of issuing the usual comic-book demands of typical terrorists, Hummel wants the United States government to pay compensation to the families of American soldiers who died in covert, officially unrecognized missions  in the amount of one hundred million dollars.  Failure to pay as per Hummel's demands will result in the obliteration of San Francisco with bio-chemical weapons.Enter the geeky Stanley Goodspeed (Nicolas Cage), a FBI bio-chemistry expert, to be part of the team needed to get onto `The Rock' and defuse the weapons.  He's paired with the renowned spy John Mason (Sean Connery), who's supposedly the only person ever to successfully escape from Alcatraz  the FBI figures since Mason knew how to sneak out of the prison undetected, he'll be able to sneak back on.  Together, Mason and Goodspeed travel to Alcatraz to thwart General Hummel's plansThe action is phenomenal and paced perfectly; director Michael Bay manages to keep a tense, frantic edge throughout most of the film, but seems to know just when to stop or slow things down so that the audience has a little time to breathe.  Many of the action scenes seem to be cribbed from other films  a car chase scene through the streets of San Francisco is nearly lifted perfectly from `Bullitt', for example, while a three-way armed standoff is highly reminiscent of any number of Sergio Leone westerns  but they're conducted with such joyful enthusiasm, that doesn't matter.  Individually, these scenes might seem like nothing but cheap knock-offs of other films, but they're brought together with such skill that the overall film looks great.  Connery is great as Mason, the spy who's seen more than any normal man should ever see, and Cage is pretty convincing as the bumbling Goodspeed, who's more comfortable with a calculator than a handgun.  Both imbue their characters with enough depth to make them a cut above typical action movie heroes.  Ed Harris steals the movie, though, as the gritty, weary Hummel  you wind up caring about him and his band of patriotic renegades a lot, and since he's technically the villain of `The Rock', it adds whole new dimensions to the standard action movie formula, dimensions that both Michael Bay and the screenwriters took the time to explore.  Ed Harris' portrayal of Hummel literally makes `The Rock' an outstanding action movie on his own.  With different actors, would this movie have been as good? Maybe . . . but I doubt it very much.Are there problems with `The Rock?'  Certainly. Hummel and his men, for example, don't seem to understand the concept of `secured radio channels', allowing Goodspeed and company to overhear vital plot information almost at will.  The tunnels beneath Alcatraz are apparently bigger than the Lincoln Tunnel, and better lit to boot.  The list goes on, but these are minor issues that only slightly detract from the awesome ride that is `The Rock'. Grade:  A-",8,2,2,9 May 2001
Se7en," Modern Horror At Its Best
","`Se7en' is all about harsh style and gruesome substance  while it's probably not a film for everyone (particularly the squeamish), it is one of the most moody, memorable films made in recent years.  A sense of absolute dread pervades each and every scene, either from the powerful words and deeds of the characters or from the dreary sets and atmosphere created by director David Fincher.  There's a quote from the film `The Crow' that goes, `It can't rain all the time' . . . well, in the world of `Se7en', it can  and it does.`Se7en' is the story of world-weary police detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a man who's probably seen more terror and sadness in his lifetime than any man should ever be forced to see.  Partnered with the young cop David Mills (Brad Pitt), Somerset is assigned to find the serial killer known only as John Doe.  The horrific crimes of Doe are patterned after the Seven Deadly Sins  for Gluttony, one victim was literally forced to eat until his internal organs exploded; for another, Greed, the victim is forced to cut an actual pound of flesh away from his own body.  John Doe is a highly literate, intelligent killer; but so is Somerset, and an astounding game of cat-and-mouse filled with unexpected twists ensues as the hunt for Doe gets underway.Andrew Kevin Walker's script for `Se7en' is absolutely dazzling.  It's smart and powerful, and doesn't pull any punches  the bodies, maimed and tortured, inexorably begin to pile up in graphic fashion, and Somerset and Mills aren't allowed to minimize the horrors they're forced to find.  Each new corpse brings a true feeling of revulsion . . . and of dread, as the realization hits that another body will be forthcoming unless John Doe is found.  The story is filled with misdirection and red herrings; just as the audience starts to think that the unfolding events of the film are starting to become predictable, the film lurches further into the unknown darkness, keeping the edge of uneasiness that pervades `Se7en' fresh . . . and constant.  Kudos also to David Fincher's stylish direction  this may be Fincher's best film to date.  The entire look of the film is dark and gloomy, almost a suicidal form of 1940s film noir, evoking a despairing atmosphere that never relents or shows a glimmer of optimism.  Combine that with Fincher's knack for turning even the most mundane scene into a nailbiter  `Se7en' features a scene with Somerset and Mills standing together in an empty field, and yet the scene is still incredibly tense  and `Se7en' becomes an exceptionally powerful, disturbing film that's difficult to turn away from.The cast?  Also excellent.  Pitt is perfect as the cocky young detective Mills, mixing together the right amount of bravado and testosterone at the start of the film, and then later tempering that swagger with cynicism  and fear  as the movie progresses forward.  In a way, Mills is a surrogate for the audience; he starts out thinking that he knows exactly what's going to happen but as events slowly unfold before his horrified eyes, it starts to dawn on Mills that he is mentally unprepared he is for a maniac like John Doe.  Pitt handles the decline of Mills from overconfident to completely paranoid with great skill.  The killer John Doe (I won't reveal his name here; the actor's uncredited in the film, so I won't mention it either on the off chance that you haven't read it elsewhere) is simply great.  He's a quiet, intense figure who is Machiavellian with his calculated words and actions.  Many other actors might've just mimicked Hannibal Lecter to portray John Doe . . . but the awesome performance in `Se7en' of the uncredited actor is actually better  and more unsettling  than Lecter himself.  The best performance of the film, however, may belong to Morgan Freeman as Somerset.  Freeman is perhaps the only person capable to tracking down John Doe, simply because he has seen so much sadness and horror before. Nothing Doe does, no matter how vile,  is able to derail the detective's efforts.  As Somerset, Freeman imbues the character with a certain tired, weary attitude . . . but still lying somewhere beneath that attitude is hope, and that small glimmer of hope, along with the wisdom of experience, is what prevents `Se7en' from spiraling into complete despair.   Somerset's hope, small as it is, becomes the audience's hope as well.With the possible exception of the very end of the film  for all its daring audacity, Fincher chooses to play it a little too safe at the film's conclusion   `Se7en' proves to be an uncompromising tour de force of modern horror.  If you're not easily bothered by graphic horror and gore, then go watch this film.  You certainly won't be disappointed.  Grade: A",9,25,40,18 May 2001
The Big Lebowski," The Dude Abides, and Walter Rules
","`The Big Lebowski' is a strange, funny film that occasionally struggles for coherence -- fortunately, this lack of coherence is usually part of its charm.  It's the story of The Dude (Jeff Bridges), also known as Jeff Lebowski, an amiable stoner trying to cruise through life on the path of least resistance.  The Dude's world is ruined one day, though, by a bunch of thugs who break into his apartment, beat him up, ruin his favorite rug . . . and realize that they've assaulted the wrong Jeff Lebowski.  The thugs were actually looking to pummel Jeff Lebowski (David Huddleston) the millionaire industrialist, who's up to his neck in trouble with organized crime.Since he was beaten up unfairly, and since his prized rug has been ruined, The Dude decides to seek compensation from this `other' Jeff Lebowski.  What follows from there is a wild tale involving kidnapping, modern art, pornography, bowling, and German nihilists.  In other words, it's another wickedly funny movie from Joel and Ethan Coen.Jeff Bridges is great as The Dude, an affable, easy-going guy who constantly struggles to do what he thinks is right throughout the film . . . even if his idea of what's right is sometimes slightly warped.  The best character of the film, though, is The Dude's best friend Walter Sobchak, as played by John Goodman.  How Goodman's portrayal of Walter failed to win an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, let alone even get nominated for one, is downright criminal.  Walter is a walking, talking, ticking time bomb, all sorts of contradictory rage rolled up into an extremely unstable package.  Walter likes to think of himself as this calm, all-knowing voice of reason, but deep down he knows he's not, and that makes him all the angrier. Watch how Walter belittles his other friend Donnie (Steve Buscemi) for Donnie's politically incorrect use of the term `Chinamen' -- and then watch shortly thereafter how Walter personally describes a group of German nihilists. It's nothing short of comic brilliance.  (Also worth noting -- Tara Reid has a very small role as `Bunny' Lebowski, but she also has the best line in the entire film.  Don't miss it.)  `The Big Lebowski' is a character-driven film, heavily reliant on the quirks and reactions of its characters to make it work.  Well, not only do the performances in the film make `The Big Lebowski' work, but they make it work magnificently.Visually, `The Big Lebowski' is one of the Coen Brothers' best; there's a loving, sweeping series of glorious shots used for the bowling sequences that are offbeat, original, and highly effective.  (There's also a point-of-view shot from inside a bowling bowl that works to great effect.) The weakest part of `Lebowski' is the actual story -- parts of the plot thread involving the German nihilists, while funny,   are often pointless and don't add much to the rest of the film.  Also, some plot threads either vanish altogether partway during the film or are never satisfactorily resolved.  That, however, is a by-product of one of the `The Big Lebowski's' overall recurring themes --'The Dude Abides.'  The Dud is easygoing enough to deal with any situation, no matter how weird or random it might be. Unfortunately, by giving the Dude weird and random situations to deal with, the overall story loses focus.  It's not a major enough problem to drag the film down significantly, but it's enough to keep a good film from becoming great.Rent it, if only to see the tour du force performance of Jon Goodman.  A bizarre and downright funny movie.  Grade: B+/A-",8,0,1,29 April 2001
Fight Club," Yet Another Victim Of Keyser Soze Disease
","Edgy, disturbing, and hard-hitting in places, `Fight Club' is a decent film that fails to ultimately live up to its initial promise.  With a devious, deftly handled opening half-hour, it's actually quite shocking how clumsy and awkward the later stages of `Fight Club' become.  It's almost as though director David Fincher so desperately wants the audience to get the point of his film, he's willing to beat the audience of the head with that point - and by doing so, the message of `Fight Club' gets lost.The film opens with the unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton), a despairing young man who's grown depressed over his boring, uneventful life, which seems to have been ripped straight out of a J. Crew catalog.  To alleviate his misery, the Narrator begins attending self-help meetings, but not meetings for depressed people.  Instead, he goes to meetings for cancer survivors, drug addicts, abuse victims; by watching the misery of others, the Narrator starts to feel better about his own life.  It's perverse and macabre, but it's also handled with wicked brilliance, and this is where `Fight Club' really shines.Unfortunately, just when the film starts to get good, the Narrator meets two people: Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who also attends self-meetings under false pretenses; and the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic man who, like the Narrator, also feels the strain and depression of being forced to live a homogenized life.  Durden's solution to this problem is his Fight Club, which is a group of disillusioned men who strip their lives down to their primitive instincts by beating the crap out of each other and doing other random, anarchic things.As Durden, much credit should be heaped upon Brad Pitt who's simply awesome in the role; even if the raw concept of `Fight Club' sounds stupid, Pitt, as Durden, speaks about his Fight Club with such passionate conviction that it at least sounds appealing for a few seconds. Unfortunately, no one ever seems to question Durden after they've had time to mull over the concept, and the members of Fight Club remain loyal to a man even after they've gotten their first taste of beating each other to a pulp.  What was a clever movie becomes instead oddly fixated on pointless violence, and that's where `Fight Club' starts to lose steam - and some of Durden's later, bigger plans just bring the film to a grinding halt.Part of Fincher's message in `Fight Club' is to point out the frustrations of the characters and the absurdities of their desperate solutions. However, this message is never clear, and in many ways Fincher instead seems to be glorifying the message of violence instead of condemning it. Fincher's direction is almost too good - it glamorizes violence to the point of looking slick and cool, instead of raw and disturbing, as it needs to be. Fincher has phenomenal visual style, but it unfortunately seems to be exactly what `Fight Club' doesn't need.  There's a certain irony to `Fight Club' - the disenfranchised young men belonging to Durden's Fight Club are essentially trading one controlled society for another - but the irony is lost when it is painted with pure adrenaline.Without giving the ending of `Fight Club' away, I'll just say that it's ineptly handled, and it suffers from the same thing many recent films have been afflicted with: Keyser Soze Disease. There's a revelation at the end of `Fight Club' that's supposed to literally blow the audience away, and profoundly change the events of the entire film (as the revelation of the identity of Keyser Soze in `The Usual Suspects' did for that film). In `Fight Club's case, though, the supposedly shocking ending seems forced, and doesn't make all the prior events of the film seem all that much different. It's shock value for the pure sake of shock, not to enhance the rest of the movie. A number of films since `The Usual Suspects' have relied on this shock-ending gimmick . . . but unless there's a good script to fall back on, this gimmick usually backfires.  It definitely backfires in `Fight Club'.`Fight Club' has a few great moments, and it certainly has the look of a great film.  Unfortunately, it's not great. It's a slick, muddled film with a garbled message.  Honestly, rent Fincher's `The Game' instead of this film - it has a similar message, except it's much clearer . . . and much better. `Fight Club' is forgettable. Grade: C+",6,3,8,14 May 2001
Alien: Resurrection," My Eyes Still Burn From The Pain -- What A Horrible Film
","Oh, what a rancid waste of film.  Alien: Resurrection is pure garbage, plain and simple.  The dialogue is awful, the acting is awful, the plot . . . well, if there actually was a plot, it would've been awful, but since one never existed, it's a moot point.  Yet again, humanity is being threatened by the Alien menace, and since humanity has apparently spent the 500 years between Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection doing nothing but picking the collective lint out of its navel, scientists decide to clone the charred remnants of Ripley into an ultimate Alien killing machine.  Of course, these same geniuses somehow don't notice that they've alos included some Alien DNA in their new Ripley clone, making her equally dangerous to both humanity and Aliens alike.  Gratuitous, badly directed combat scenes ensue.
Sigourney Weaver gets to chew some scenery by playing the Ripley clone, who's far more aggressive and violent that the Ripley of past Alien films. At least she was fun to watch, even if the character made absolutely no logical sense.  And then there's the latest android/human fascimile of the series . . . Winona Ryder, as Annalee.  Hee, hee; she's unwatchably bad. She pouts and whines her way through the film, trying to act tough but ultimately looking nothing short of pathetic.  Bring back Lance Henrickson as Bishop.  Hey, bring back Ian Holm as the homicidal Ash, at least he'd be better than Ryder.  How Winona Ryder got into this film will probably go down as the greatest mystery of the Twentieth century; she's THAT bad.About the only saving grace of the film are the sets, which faithfully recreate the moods and claustrophic creepiness of 'Alien' and 'Aliens' . . . unfortunately, by reminding you of those films, you're also constantly reminded of how bad 'Alien: Resurrection' really is.  This film stinks, avoid it like the plague.  Grade: D-",3,2,2,19 April 2001
The Others," Slow, Deliberate, Stylish . . . and Slow, Slow, Slow.
","It seems overly simple to classify 'The Others' as a cross between classic Hitchcock and 'The Sixth Sense' . . . mostly, because that implies 'The Others' is a film of that highest caliber.  It's certainly not.  However, it's not awful, either; instead 'The Others' unfortunately falls into the film limbo of being just plain mediocre.  'The Others' is a suspense/horror film owing a lot to its predecessors from the 1940s -- it relies on mood, atmosphere, and the casts to create the eerie mood that permeates the film, and never falls back on gratuitous gore to create its horrors.  The look and feel of 'The Others' is very much that of a vintage Universal film; in fact, if this film had been made in black & white, and if a digital CGI version of Lana Turner could be inserted in Nicole Kidman's place, you would probably swear that this was a forgotten suspense/horror film from that era.   It's definitely not a classic -- there's a number of significant issues that add up together to keep 'The Others' far, far short of greatness -- but it's an interesting film nonetheless.'The Others' is, at its heart, a vintage ghost story -- on a small island off the shores of England, there is a forlorn manor house located far away from the trappings of civilization.  Living in this isolated house are the elegant Grace (Nicole Kidman) and her two children, Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley).  There are strange rules in the house, which Grace cryptically explains to her new servants are important. Each of the fifty doors in the house must be locked before another can be opened. The curtains must always be drawn. While odd, these rules are vital, Grace explains, because Anne and Nicholas are so allergic to the sunlight that they might die if exposed to it.  The servants, led by the wise Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), accede to these rules . . . but they begin to hears voices. And things going bump in the night.  So do Anne and Nicholas.  Grace doesn't hear these things, or at least she claims not to, which slowly but surely leads to the questions: Are these new servants creating the disturbances for some sinister purpose?  Is troubled Anne creating them?  Is Grace?  Or does something really lurk within the walls of the manor house, something long-dead, something evil . . .'The Others' relies on its pacing and direction to create its ominous mood. This reliance is both the film's strength and ultimate downfall.  Director Alejandro Amenabar lets the viewer savor each moment of the film, building suspense from scene to scene at a slow and steady pace, dropping subtle hints about what has happened and what's going to happen with a very deft touch . . . he really lets things build slowly.  In fact, too slowly. 'The Sixth Sense' also moved along at an unhurried pace, but at least that film had the good sense to know that in order to maintain the slow pace, some sort of payoff -- or at least a good scare -- has to be tossed out the audience once in awhile, if only to keep some interest and to prevent the film from spiraling into mind-numbing boredom.  'The Others' has no sense of this.  An hour into the film, the luxurious pace of 'The Others' has become little more than self-indulgent tedium.  The process of building tension degenerates into pure impatience.  There's only two moments in 'The Others' that can genuinely be considered 'jump-out-of-your-seat' moments; if there had been three or four more of these moments, the film might've averted its slow, steady crash into monotony.  Yes, some of the scenes are extremely impressive, and I was particularly impressed with a lot of the cinematography, as well as the richness of the dialogue . . . but these things only can carry a film so far.  They have to lead to some kind of ultimate payoff in order to truly mean anything, and in the case of 'The Others', that payoff never comes.  It's a nice film with some wicked little touches, a few of which border on pure genius . . . and then the film ends. No build-up to a dramatic resolution -- or, for that matter, a satisfying resolution.  For that reason, 'The Others' can be appreciated for what it is trying to accomplish, and for the techniques it uses . . . but in no way, shape, or form can the end result be called a success.  It's a shame, because it seems as though it wouldn't have taken much to turn 'The Others' from a bland film into one that was grippingly tense.
Though billed as the star of this film, Nicole Kidman falls just short of providing the strength that 'The Others' needed from its central character -- the film revolves mostly around her character's beliefs and perceptions, and she's simply not up to the task of making those beliefs and perceptions one thousand percent convincing.  Personally, I've always found Ms. Kidman to be somewhat of an acting enigma -- she's undeniably talented, but apart from her tour de force performance in 'To Die For', she always appears to be struggling to find the right outlet for her talent.  There's flashes of brilliance from Ms Kidman in 'The Others', but that's it, only flashes -- overall, the performance is uneven.  I found myself wondering what the film would've been like had it featured either Julianne Moore or Helena Bonham Carter as its star.  Fortunately, there's a 'sleeper' star in this film, one I would hope to see in many films in the years to come: Alakina Mann, who plays Grace's young daughter Anne.  As Anne, this young actress shows both strength and vulnerability with a powerful range, one rarely seen in young actors and actresses today.  She's asked to go head-to-head with Ms. Kidman on a number of occasions in the film, and not only does Ms. Mann hold her own, she shines through like a champion.  If nothing else, 'The Others' might be worth watching simply to see Alakina Mann's superb performance.'The Others' probably could never have been made without the success of the equally low-key 'Sixth Sense'.  'The Others', though, while possessing an undeniable sense of style and grace, is a film ultimately without a lot to say . . . or a lot to give to its audience.  As such, 'The Others' is a film with some interesting qualities, some more enjoyable than others -- but it's ultimately little more than an okay film that goes on way longer than it should.  'Interesting' doesn't always mean 'good' -- and with 'The Others', this is certainly the case.  Grade: B-",6,1,3,20 August 2001
L.A. Confidential," Film Noir Revisited -- And Man, Is It Sweet, Daddy-O
","Film noir is a style that's usually difficult to pull off.  Invariably, any movie done in the film noir style features flawed characters that are frequently unlikable; shadowy crosses, double-crosses, and triple-crosses that can make the story difficult to follow; and an unhappy ending that ultimately seems unsatisfying.  'L.A. Confidential', which can only be defined as a film noir mystery, meets all of the required criteria above . .. and yet it's still one hell of a compelling, fascinating movie.  'L.A. Confidential' takes a lot of difficult material and blends it all together seamlessly.  For that alone, the film should be noteworthy; the fact that the story is outstanding and the acting is exceptional pushes 'L.A. Confidential' into the realms of the truly great.'L. A. Confidential' is a gritty, stylish film patterned after the mysteries and crime drama films of the 1940s and 1950s, particularly those of Humphrey Bogart and Alan Ladd. Containing a dizzying number of plots, subplots, and enough red herrings to choke a horse, the storylines and characters are slowly woven together to create one single dark and beautiful film.  It begins with some gruesome killings -- which are dubbed by the press as 'The Nite Owl Murders' -- and Ed Exley (Guy Pearce), a no-nonsense police detective, is assigned to the case. Ed's reluctant partner is flashy Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey), a vain cop who sees himself more as part of the entertainment business than the police force.  After some questionably ethical police work, Vincennes believes that he has wrapped up murders, but Detective Bud White (Russell Crowe) -- a cop usually better known for his fists than for his sleuthing ability -- discovers that there may be more to the 'Nite Owl Murders' than meets the eye, and may involve some of L.A.'s highest ranking officials.  As the case truly begins to unravel, it becomes obvious that only the unlikely teaming of White, Exley and Vincennes can hope to ever discover the truth about what really happened.Based on the James Ellroy novel of the same name, 'L.A. Confidential' perfectly captures the look and feel of the sweaty, sleazy underbelly of 1950s Los Angeles.  Mirroring the events of the film, everything on screen has a slightly dirty look to it, as if nothing can be entirely clean or free of guilt.  Even the language used is perfect -- the presence of the character Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) really brings to the forefront a distinct Fifties-ish feel to things with his weekly gossip column, where everything is `on the Q-T and strictly hush-hush'.  And the stories themselves are marvelous as well, each starting out from an isolated spot in the film, but eventually winding and coiling together to form one single powerhouse of a plot.  Some of the machinations by which these stories and plot wrap together seem slightly forced; but for the most part, it's pulled off so masterfully that these minor blemishes really don't matter.
Director Curtis Hanson does a terrific job of evoking the film noir feel without seeming like he's just mindlessly copying it.  The deliberate pacing of the film, the way certain shots are framed in shadow, the manner in which ominous events are foretold . . . everything helps to add to the story one way or another; there's precious little that seems like a waste of time or takes away from the film.  Equally impressive is just how the film is pieced together - there's a lot of stories and even more information for the audience to digest in `L.A. Confidential'. However, it's all laid out in a sequence that's relatively simple to understand; Hanson also knows where to let the characters tell the story, and where to let the actual visuals of the film tell the story.  `L.A. Confidential' is a film that easily could've been little more than a convoluted mess in other hands; in Curtis Hanson's hands, though, it's a gem of a film.And the acting . . . wow, where to begin?  (With the main characters, I suppose . . .) Kevin Spacey is great as Jack Vincennes, the cynical cop 'on the take' who does a terrific job of letting the world know how much he doesn't give a damn about anything . . . but when push comes to shove, he reluctantly cares about a lot, perhaps even too much. Not many actors could pull off the part of Vincennes, but Kevin Spacey makes it look easy. Russell Crowe is equally great as detective Bud White, who for much of the movie is little more than a pit bull in human form.  However, Bud proves to be far more dangerous when he actually starts combining his mind with his muscle. Finally, Guy Pearce complements the other main characters in grand style as the arrogant, self-righteous, by-the-book Lieutenant Ed Exley. It's a nice touch in the film that he only starts to become likeable -- and a better cop -- when he starts bending the rules and becoming more unethical in his approach to policework; it's also interesting to notice that as he becomes less and less moral, Vincennes and White start becoming more and more moral. Exley's a little more subtle than the other two main characters, but he's equally as good as they are, and Guy Pearce deserves a lot of credit for his work in this film.Even the minor characters are great; however, the most impressive minor character is James Cromwell as Captain Dudley Smith.  This man is EVIL. Ruthless and cold, Cromwell effortlessly turns in a tour du force performance as a despicable, cold-hearted villain.  I'll admit I was shocked to see him pull off the role so well; I had a mental picture of Mr. Cromwell as the gentle farmer in 'Babe' before watching 'L.A. Confidential'. . . . wow.  James Cromwell definitely has incredible talent and range.`L.A. Confidential' has a distinct dark side to it; it's certainly not a film for everyone.  It is, however, an undeniably sharp, clever, and stylish film, one that won't easily be forgotten . . . and will probably demand being watched more than once.  One of the best films of 1997.

Snatch," A Glorious, Enthusiastic Mess of a Film
","Guy Ritchie's `Snatch' is a highly entertaining crime caper featuring innovative (and often brilliant) direction as well as a horde of memorable, over-the-top characters. The direction and the characters are so good, in fact, that it's quite easy to overlook the threadbare story buried at the bottom of the film. `Snatch' is a great example of a film that excels at flash, flair and extraneous details . . . but has some significant problems with its basic foundation. The end results are still remarkably good, but the flaws  while covered up incredibly well -- are enough to keep `Snatch' from achieving the greatness that it comes so close to grasping. (Or snatching, as the case may be.)The film begins with underground fight promoter Turkish (Jason Statham), a decent guy running with a bad crowd, agreeing to put one his fighters in a fixed bout for the big-time criminal Brick Top (Alan Ford). Meanwhile, Franky Four Fingers (Del Toro), who has recently stolen an eighty-five carat diamond for his boss Cousin Avi (Farina), has decided to place some bets on Brick Top's fixed fight.  Nothing goes even remotely right for anyone, of course, and soon there's a mad search on for the diamond by a number of low-life hoodlums, as well as some problems arising from Turkish's new bare-knuckle brawler, a Gypsy named Mickey (Brad Pitt). .  .
`Snatch' is a film that's pure eye candy, which is why it's such a joy to watch. Give Guy Ritchie massive amounts of credit -- the man's quite a director. He's a master at editing scenes together in innovative ways, and putting together otherwise ordinary scenes with ingenious and creative methods. `Snatch' is a veritable how-to handbook on visual directing techniques, and it's almost a downright guilty pleasure watching Mr. Ritchie construct this film into such a vibrant, dazzling-looking finished product. The same must be said for the characters, who seem to have come from a place somewhere between `Dick Tracy' and `Reservoir Dogs' -- each and every character in `Snatch' is a distinct and memorable creation, worthy of starring in their own movie, every if they're only on screen for a few moments. (Cousin Avi, Doug the Head, Frankie Four Fingers, Boris the Blade .. . good gravy, where does Guy Ritchie get these wonderful names?) All the characters in `Snatch'  and the terrific actors playing them -- are simply awesome. If any deserve special mention, though, it's Jason Statham as the beleaguered fight manager Turkish and Vinnie Jones as the villainous Bullet Tooth Tony. (Any mainstream action film producer would be wise to cast Vinnie Jones as the main villain in any upcoming summer blockbuster; it's almost scary how well Mr. Jones can play a cold-blooded killer.) The characters are an utter joy to watch, and they're filmed in such a highly original and entertaining manner that `Snatch' actually stands apart from other standard action films and independent Tarantino wannabes as something worth watching.The real problem with `Snatch', though, is that for all its wonderful scenes and awesome characters . . . there's simply not enough story to go around. There's two basic storylines for the film, both pretty good -- but even combined, these storylines are barely enough to last an hour. On the commentary track for the DVD of `Snatch', Guy Ritchie states that his goal for the film was to make a lean and mean story -- well, he succeeded at that goal, but the lean, mean story gets completely bogged down from the weight of its overwhelming horde of characters. Despite how good they are, `Snatch' either would've benefited from a reduction of its cast, if only to provide more time to focus on the storylines; or the addition of a third storyline giving some of the characters more to do also could've helped. (It also might've helped if there was more correlation between the two storylines; the relationship between the two is cursory at best. What's going on in one storyline usually has only slight, minor repercussions affecting the other, and most of the time `Snatch' feels like two distinct and separate small films.)`Snatch' is a terrific joy ride of a film. The only problem is that the ride really doesn't go anywhere. Still, `Snatch' is one of the best-looking films of the year, and even if it's not necessarily the most satisfying of films, it's certainly a heck of a lot of fun. Worth checking out, for sure.

Full Metal Jacket," What Is Your Major Malfunction?
","'Full Metal Jacket', which often seems to be more a random collection of loosely connected stories than an actual movie, dooms itself to mediocrity by telling its best stories first. The first half hour is incredibly powerful, possibly the best work that master director Stanley Kubrick ever captured on film . . . and then the film stumbles backwards, unable to maintain the impossibly high standards that it established for itself. Since the film has nowhere to go but down, down it goes, and without a unifying theme holding the film together, 'Full Metal Jacket' degenerates into a confusing mess. 'Full Metal Jacket' is about the journey of one man, Private Davis(Matthew Modine), during the Vietnam War, starting with boot camp and heading inexorably onward to the horrors found in Vietnam. Throughout all his experiences, finds nothing but madness and chaos in everything he sees, from his maniacal drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey, whose performance is absolutely flawless in this film) to the Vietnamese 'enemy' to the soldiers on his own side. In a way, the original movie poster for 'Full Metal Jacket' best describes the film -- it shows a soldier's helmet decorated with both a psychedelic peace symbol and the angrily scrawled phrase BORN TO KILL. The strength of 'Full Metal Jacket' is ultimately its downfall as well - the opening training scenes at Paris Island. While Davis is essentially the main character of the film (or at least the main observer), the basic training sequence of events focuses primarily on the horrifying relationship between Drill Instructor Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and one unfortunate recruit nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). To be fair, Sergeant Hartman treats all the recruits (including Davis, whom Hartman nicknames `Private Joker`) with equal amounts of venom and disdain, but it's Private Pyle that's affected by it the most, and as such, Pyle's relationship with Sergeant Hartman becomes the cornerstone of all the basic training scenes. R. Lee Ermey (who in real life was an actual Marine drill instructor before his foray into acting) puts on such a brutally honest, harrowing, and disturbing performance that it's unforgettable . . . and it easily blows the performance of almost every other actor in the movie. (Watch for a priceless scene where the sergeant tries to inspire his recruits for a sharpshooting drill . . . and uses Lee Harvey Oswald as his shining example of marksmanship.) The exception to this is Vincent D'Onofrio, who turns Private Pyle into a ticking timebomb of insecurities, wanting desperately to succeed and to please the sergeant - although, deep down, Pyle knows he'll never be anything but a failure in the sergeant's eyes. Two masterful performances, both bordering on film perfection, but since neither Sergeant Hartman nor Private Pyle continue onward with Davis to Davis's part in the Vietnam conflict, the rest of the film suffers greatly. After basic training, it's off to the Vietnam War, and this is where the film just falls apart. Some scenes are undeniably brilliant, some are uninspired and awful, but no matter the quality of the scenes, there's nothing linking them all together. Perhaps this was Kubrick's intent, to show that one of the most horrifying things about war is just how meaningless it all is. But telling the truth doesn't automatically translate into telling a great story, or even a mediocre one, and 'Full Metal Jacket' degenerates into a muddled heap of conflicting messages and morals despite its raw honesty. Yes, it's sad and horrifying, but it's done in such an detached, unfocused manner that the brain becomes numb to the horror, instead of outraged by it.
Two grades for 'Full Metal Jacket': An A+ for the basic training scenes, which are equal parts brilliant and distrurbing, and a C+ for the overall movie, which sadly falls apart once those basic training scenes end. Not one of Kubrick's better films.",6,1,3,10 May 2001
Forrest Gump," Great Film, Horrible Message
","I have a difficult time watching (and reviewing) `Forrest Gump'.  Despite the brilliance of its actors, of director Robert Zemeckis, and of certain powerful scenes, I find that the overall film itself is a cynical lie.  On the surface, `Gump' is a cheerful film about the perseverance of its genuinely sweet title character.  Under that sweetness, though is a disturbing, uncomfortable message that says daring to dream is a bad idea.For the seven people who haven't seen `Forrest Gump', the film deals with the travels and troubles of one Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks), an affable man with an IQ of 75 who manages to bounce around key historical events from 1950 onward in `Zelig'-like fashion.  Forrest inadvertently teaches Elvis to swivel his hips.  Forest accidentally becomes a football star.  Forest accidentally becomes a Vietnam war hero, then accidentally becomes a successful businessman.  (See a pattern?)  Throughout all his travels and misadventures, Forrest is forced to deal with adversity and hardship  and he can never seem to fully capture the love of his childhood sweetheart Jenny (Robin Wright-Penn)  but through sheer niceness and through blind faith in the goodness of others, Forrest invariably manages to push on through his difficulties and to triumph in life.Again, on the surface, a sweet, glowing, feel-good film.  Despite my own misgivings about the film, there's no doubt that Tom Hanks is simply awesome as Gump  he clearly deserved the Oscar he won for the role. He gives Forrest Gump a childlike innocence, but there's more to it that that; there's a certain confidence that he exudes at all the right times, as well as insecurities at his low moments.  Forrest Gump is certainly far more complex than the simple figure he appears to be at first glance, and I can't think of any actor who could've played it better than Hanks.  Robin Wright-Penn is perfect as Jenny, who makes an astonishing journey through the years between wide-eyed to hardened cynicism to the acceptance and understanding of experience.  I'm surprised she wasn't nominated for an Oscar as well.  Gary Sinise makes a perfect counterpoint to Gump in the Vietnam era as Lieutenant Dan, another person who can't seem to travel through life quite as smoothly as Forrest does.  Combine this with a superbly paced film, with moments both funny and sorrowful (often at the same time), as well as some of the best, subtle uses of CGI effects ever put to celluloid, and `Forrest Gump' should be one of the best films of all time.  Right?In my opinion, no.  `Gump' is a bitter, bitter movie.  Look at Jenny's dreams and aspirations, how hard she works to attain them, and how little she actually accomplishes.  Ditto the dreams of Lieutenant Dan, or Gump's friend Bubba (Mykelti Williamson).  For them, their hopes never ultimately amount to anything, not without the `accidental' help of Forrest Gump, anyway.  Forrest, who has no ambitions, and never shows any true interest in doing anything, becomes wildly successful by doing nothing.  In essence, those who dare to dream in `Forrest Gump' are punished for their ambition, while those who do nothing are handsomely rewarded.  Considering that some of Jenny's dreams (and Lieutenant Dan's) are particularly selfish  in fact, a few are downright noble  I found this little understated message to be incredibly disturbing.  It bothered me enough to make me not like this film at all, despite all the wonderful moments it does contain.`Forrest Gump' gets an overall grade of a C+ -- it starts out as an `A', but its dark underlying cynicism drags it back down to that level.  But hey, I could be wrong.  It's simply the Mad Reviewer's opinion.  Good or bad, there's some great performances, and it's also thought-provoking.  Watch it for yourself, and let me know what you think.",6,6,12,8 May 2001
Predator," Lean, Mean Action With Arnold
","Watching `Predator', which is one of Arnold Schwarzenegger's best action movies, it becomes obvious why Arnold's recent return to action (`End of Days', `The Sixth Day) have all tanked at the box office.  For some reason, Arnold's chosen to play men with a dark past in his recent films, men with a complex background . . . men with laughably bad backstories.  His great characters - such as Dutch Schaeffer in `Predator' - have no background. It's not necessary.  The second Arnold steps onscreen, you know it's time for blood and bullets, plain and simple.  Not every moviegoers' cup of tea, to be sure, but it works.  Unlike `End of Days' or `The Sixth Day', classic Schwarzenegger action films like `Predator' never insult the audience by attempting to explain the often threadbare plot.  Predator is kind of a Zen-philosophy action film - the violence and cheesy one-liners just happen.`Predator' is a fairly simple story; it's essentially a sci-fi version of `The Most Dangerous Game.'  A group of American soldiers, led by Dutch (Schwarzenegger) and his rival Dillon (Carl Weathers), lead a full-blown assault on a group of South American revolutionaries.  Carnage ensues. After wiping out said revolutionaries, an alien creature armed to the teeth with high-powered weaponry - the Predator - assaults the American soldiers. More carnage ensues.Hey, it's not exactly Shakespeare, but thoughtful, well-written action movies aren't exactly common.  `Predator' works as an action movie - and as a darn good one - because it's kept simple (thus minimizing the plot holes and the head-scratching moments), it maintains a high level of excitement, action, and tension, and it's cool.  Schwarzenegger is larger than life as Dutch, pure swaggering testosterone at its best.  Jesse `The Body' rules as Blaine, Carl Weathers is icily cool as Dillon. . . and so on and so on. Enough sarcastic, macho one-liners and brutal firepower fill the movie to make it a male adolescent snapshot of tough-guy heaven.  The Predator looks wicked as well - Stan Winston outdid himself, as the Predator does look and move like a vicious being from another world, and not just some stunt guy in a rubber suit.  The direction by John McTiernan adds the final piece to the puzzle; the cinematography of the jungle is appropriately hot, steamy, and claustrophobic, and the quick pacing of the film moves rapid fire between all-out action and the tension of hunting one's prey . . . or being hunted. Everything adds up to a simple, streamlined, first-rate action movie.Again, not the most intelligent film ever made, but `Predator' is still quite good - it's probably Schwarzenegger's best pure action movie.  (Not his best movie overall, though; that honor belongs to the excellent `Kindergarten Cop'.)  `Predator' is a lean, mean, intense action flick from start to finish.

Armageddon," Held Back By The Weight Of Its Own Excesses
","The problem with blockbuster films like `Armageddon' is that they want to do everything.  They want heartbreaking romance, pulse-pounding action, gripping drama, slapstick comedy . . . all in the same film.  Trouble is, few films ever succeed in accomplishing this tricky blend of different genres.  `Armageddon' isn't one of them.In a nutshell, `Armageddon' starts out as a disaster epic, with a Texas-sized meteor hurtling towards Earth.  This meteor will obliterate all life on Earth unless a group of oil drillers can somehow fly to the meteor, drill a big hole into the side of the meteor, and blow up the meteor with a sizeable amount of nuclear explosives.  Mixed into this disaster epic is a full-blown romance, comedy, serious, thought-provoking moments, and a smattering of other scenes designed to give `Armageddon' the feel of a true Hollywood epic.  What comes out instead is a true, bloated Hollywood mess. `Armageddon', which at least looks cool and has the superficial sheen of a Hollywood blockbuster, is weighted down by a barely there script and awkward shifts of tone.  It's hard to take a character's impassioned speech about saving the Earth seriously when he's only been cracking jokes about the matter only moments before.  Shifts in mood like this look effortless and natural when they're done right; the shifts between comedy/drama/romance/et cetera in `Armageddon' are labored and forced.  The story suffers from major plot holes as well. Forget the logistical impossibilities of `Armageddon'; even simple stuff gets made unbelievably preposterous.   For example, the meteor is the size of Texas . . . but the drillers only have to drill down four hundred feet into the meteor's surface?  Hey, why bother drilling at all, if that's the case? There's a tedious section of the film involving the Mir space station that does nothing but waste film, there's enough crashes and accidents to fill twelve action films, let alone one - `Armageddon' reeks of excess, and suffers because of it.As Harry Stamper, Bruce Willis saves this film from being unwatchable crap. Even if the story's ludicrous, he makes Harry Stamper a quiet, reluctant, slightly believable hero, and more importantly, he makes Stamper somebody an audience can root for.  Willis is good enough to single-handedly pull `Armageddon' out of the trash and make it at least entertaining.  Also good is Michael Duncan Clarke as `Bear' - he comes across as a person, rather than just as a cartoon character, and as such he's someone to root for as well.  Ben Affleck is completely bland and forgettable as A.J. Frost, as is Liv Tyler as Harry Stamper's daughter Grace- considering they're the two romantically linked characters, it makes for a fairly uninteresting romance. If the Harry Stamper character didn't care so much about Grace and A.J., both of those characters would've been a complete waste of screen time.Still, `Armageddon' deserves credit for trying to hit a home run, even if it only wound up with a cheap single.  The movie's still kind of fun, in a mindless, dumb sort of way.  If you're in the mood for a decent, cheesy popcorn flick, rent it, and watch it on a big screen TV with a killer sound system.  But only watch it once, unless you want the plot holes to drive you utterly mad.  Grade: B-/C+",6,0,1,30 April 2001
Pitch Black," Decent Sci-Fi Fare
","Like the original `Alien', `Pitch Black' is a sci-fi/horror hybrid -- a group of people in the far-flung future find themselves confront by an alien menace in hostile, unknown surroundings.  `Pitch Black' clearly owes a lot of its influences to Ridley Scott's `Alien', but it never sinks so low as to blatantly rip `Alien' off -- `Pitch Black' has a couple of neat touches that make it stand out.  However, it's typical movie cliches that drag `Pitch Black' back towards the realm of mediocrity, and keep it from being a really good film.Somewhere in the distant reaches of space, a freak meteor storm knocks a star freighter off course, sending the freighter crashing to the surface of an unknown planet.  The survivors, which include pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), bounty hunter Johns (Cole Hauser), and Riddick (Vin Diesel), a sociopathic killer who was being transported back  to prison, discover strange alien creatures lurking beneath the surface of the planet.  These creatures, which cannot stand light, have a taste for blood . . . and soon, they'll be swarming the surface, as a rare eclipse that sends the entire planet into darkness is only hours away.The story, while uneven, has some neat moments -- the inclusion of the Muslim leader Imam (Keith David) and his ragtag band of religious followers added some unexpected dimensions to the film; and the way the kid Jack (Rhiana Griffith) develops a macabre form of hero-worship for the killer Riddick, while disturbing, is probably somewhat realistic.  What truly brings `Pitch Black' down a few notches is the sheer number of unbelievable things that keep piling on top of each other.   The crashed ship just happens to have landed on a sun-drenched planet mere hours before an eclipse that only occurs every twenty-two years is set to begin.  The ship also just happens to be holding a ruthless killer, said ruthless killer just happens to have surgically-adjusted eyes that can see perfectly in the dark . . . the list goes on and on and on.  A few of these would be fine -- willing suspension of disbelief is all part of the movie-going experience -- but after the first dozen or so, it's sheer overkill.  Any small, cool original moments created in `Pitch Black' are inevitably lost amidst the big, steaming piles of unbelievable nonsense.As Riddick, Vin Diesel injects a large amount of coolness in `Pitch Black'. He gives the character enough nuances to keep things from getting boring. Radhia Mitchell was also quite good as the pilot Carolyn, who's forcibly thrust into being the leader after the captain dies in the initial crash. Her struggles in taking charge of the survivors is very believable, and very good.  The rest . . . well, they're predictable stereotypes.  They do a good job, but their every action is incredibly predictable, making `Pitch Black' a lot less tense than it should've been.  Of note is David Twohy's excellent direction:  the way the planet is initially bleached blindingly bone-white after the crash adds a real sense of desolation to the desert plant, and serves to contrast nicely, with, well, the pitch black darkness of the eclipse.  He keeps things moving along at a fairly quick pace, adding enough tension to constantly keep things interesting.  The idea of keeping the CGI creature mostly unseen in the dark is also a good one -- they're a lot creepier that way, and by using them prominently, they might've looked lame if the CGI effects weren't perfect.A pretty respectable thrill ride; definitely check it out if you're a fan of sci-fi films.

American Psycho," Delivers Some Shocks, But Ultimately Just Hollow And Boring
","Much like its contemporary 'Fight Club', the film 'American Psycho' attempts to express dissatisfaction with the status quo of modern society through shocking (and typically violent) means. However, while this intent can be applauded -- sometimes, it's good to shake things up a little -- the execution cannot. 'American Psycho', for the most part, features unlikable, unsympathetic characters doing unlikable, unsympathetic things to one another, ultimately creating a film that's very difficult to care about . .. or to take seriously. Based on the overrated novel by Bret Easton Ellis, 'American Psycho' is the story of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), a young, handsome Wall Street stock broker who's finding it more and more difficult to deal with how utterly hypocritical and fake his life has become. He hates the world so much, he doesn't feel like a real person, so the only way he knows how to feel real is by committing acts of sadistic depravity -- rape, torture, and murder. The ironic thing is, Bateman doesn't try to cover his tracks particularly well -- he almost wants to get caught -- but no one else believes he's capable of such heinous acts; after all, how could such a young, good-looking successful man be such a monster? The problem with 'American Psycho' lies with the psycho himself -- Bateman. Christian Bale does an admirable job with the character, considering how badly the part is written, but the fact of the matter is that Bateman is never a particularly sympathetic protagonist. Yes, the people he tortures and kills are a bunch of unpleasant, two-faced hypocrites, but considering that Bateman is really no better than they are, there's no way of understanding, let alone condoning, his actions. He also has options besides becoming a serial killer, obvious (and more positive) options.  Think about it -- Bateman's been given more opportunities (money, friends, intelligence) than most people can ever even dream of in his life, and he chooses just to squander them as an Ed Gein-wannabe?  Come on.  Another problem is that Bateman is far too sane. He's nuts enough to think up some incredibly sick stuff to do to people, but he's rational enough to realize what he's doing is wrong. It may not have made him more sympathetic, but it might have made the character slightly more believable if he'd been crazier, thinking that his sick actions were just as rational as the mundane, boring things he did at work. (A subplot involving the idea that Bates isn't actually killing anybody -- all the murders are just in his head -- helps to make the film a little more believable, but not by much.) The result? One mean-spirited person kills a bunch of other mean-spirited people. Who cares?
Visually, the film's fine. Director Mary Harron moves the film along at a smooth pace, flipping with great style between false notes of security and genuinely disturbing. However, since the disturbing elements are diluted by the fact that it's difficult to care at all about the characters involved in 'American Psycho', some tremendous efforts in regards to cinematography and editing get wasted. Ditto the performance of the actors -- as mentioned above, Christian Bale is very good as Bates, Willem Dafoe is good as the criminally under-used private investigator Donald Kimball . . . but no actor or actress on the face of the Earth could ever make any these characters remotely interesting, likable, or for that matter, watchable.
'American Psycho' deserves some credit for trying to be daring, but it's ultimately an emotionally hollow film filled with some oddly gratuitous, clinically detached violence. Pass this one up. Grade: C-",5,11,24,11 May 2001
Aliens," What're We Supposed To Use Now, Harsh Language?
","I felt so soiled after watching the mindless train wreck called `Alien: Resurrection' that I was compelled to watch `Aliens' immediately afterward, in order to cleanse my palette and to remind myself why Hollywood keeps the `Alien' franchise on life support.  Man, if only some new director could recapture the essence of `Aliens', or if only James Cameron could be convinced to direct the next film in the franchise.  `Aliens' is that good.`Aliens', for the uninitiated, picks up sixty some-odd years after the end of the original `Alien'.  Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), the lone survivor of the doomed spaceship Nostromo, is found by a passing galactic freighter and revived from suspended animation.  Ripley learns that the lethal lessons learned by her ship's crew went unnoticed by the rest of the universe  the planet where her crew found the original deadly Alien creature has been partially terraformed and colonized by human settlers.  But, surprise surprise, the colony's been wiped out, and now a hard-bitten group of Space Marines are going to the planet to find out what happened.  Ripley is conscripted as an advisor and goes back to the planet with the Marines, where they discover that the colony hasn't been wiped out by a single Alien. . . but by an Alien brood mother and her legions of hungry, vicious, offspring.In making `Aliens', James Cameron created a great sequel to a great original film, one that manages to remain true to the original while offering a fresh take on old ideas.  Cameron took the original look and feel of the Alien creatures, remained faithful with the character of Ripley . . . and then moved forward with a brand new story.  `Aliens' isn't simply a rehash of Ridley Scott's `Alien'.  While they possess certain common denominators, they're two distinctly different films.  `Aliens' is wall-to-wall pulse-pounding action, while `Alien' is more straightforward horror. Cameron deliberately didn't try to copy Ridley Scott, which is why this film works so well . . . and why the later sequels don't.  Those later films have nothing new to say.The fights between the Marines and the Aliens are gripping as well, masterfully directed and choreographed by Cameron.  The Marines, while mostly personality stereotypes, are fairly memorable as well  it's quite a shock to see their bravado before they encounter the Aliens, and the shreds of what's left afterwards.  A great ensemble cast  Michael Biehn is very good as the vulnerable Sergeant Hicks, as is Lance Henrikson as the android Bishop (in a nice nod to the `Terminator' films, it's implied that androids were originally created by the Cyberdyne Corporation), and Paul Reiser is outstanding as Carter Burke, an oily government executive.  Besides Sigourney Weaver, though, the best performance comes from Carrie Henn as Newt, the little girl who also happens to be the only survivor of the original colony massacre.  Her character's vital to the film  Ripley wants to protect Newt at all costs, much as the Alien Brood mother wants to protect her lethal progeny.  If Newt was unlikable, or if she was just a two-dimensional cardboard cutout, a lot of Ripley's motivations  and the plot  would fall flat on its face.  Fortunately, she's terrific.  And so is `Aliens'.There are a few plot holes that keep `Aliens' from being a classic, but the film moves along at such a rapid pace, you really don't have much time to notice them.  Still, `Aliens' is one of James Cameron's best films.  It's a pure adrenaline rush from start to finish.  If you haven't seen it yet, I highly recommend renting it sometime soon.  You won't be disappointed. Grade: A-",8,1,1,20 April 2001
Pearl Harbor," Emotionally Hollow and Insulting
","Over the past couple of years, producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay have proven themselves to be extremely adept at creating `popcorn movies' - good, solid action films that probably aren't going to win any Oscars, but are undeniably entertaining.  The secret to making these sorts of films (`The Rock', `Armageddon') seems to be to hype up the action and to not take things terribly seriously.  Unfortunately, Bruckheimer and Bay took the same cavalier attitude in making `Pearl Harbor', a film whose very subject matter demands a certain amount of respect. By its very nature, `Pearl Harbor' should've been a film that made the audience ponder the absolute senseless horror of war . . . instead, it's a popcorn movie.  The fact that the attack on Pearl Harbor is treated with so little respect is not only disappointing, it's downright insulting. SPOILERS ALERT Like `Titanic', the film `Pearl Harbor' uses a romance between fictional characters to help tell a true story.  Not a bad idea, except the romance in `Pearl Harbor' is so wooden and forced, watching it is like having a salad fork stuck in your eye.  (For those of you who thought the romance in `Titanic' was bad . . . heh, heh, wait 'til you see `Pearl Harbor'!)  The film starts with two childhood friends from Tennessee named Rafe McCawley (Ben Affleck) and Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett). After the obligatory opening childhood sequence to demonstrate how tight these two guys really are, we get to see them enter the Army Air Corps and both fall in love - gee, who could've seen this coming? - with the same pretty young nurse, Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale).  Evelyn first chooses Rafe as her love interest, but when he's reported dead, Danny gets his chance. The reports of Rafe's death turn out to be greatly exaggerated, and he of course returns to find Evelyn . . . in Pearl Harbor, mere hours before the start of the bombing.
Forgetting the actual bombing for a second, the romance is so witless it's funny.  I kept expecting to see Crow and Tom Servo from MST3K pop in the corner of the movie screen.  Lines like 'I'm gonna give Danny my whole heart, but I don't think I'll ever look at another sunset without thinking of you' scream Tori Spelling TV-Movie-Of-The-Week . . . the fact that they're in a big-budget movie like this is hysterical.  The problem is, the romance is so uninteresting that it's impossible to care about either Rafe, Danny, or Evelyn - so when the bombs start falling on Pearl Harbor, their fate really doesn't matter.  This lack of emotional investment in any of these characters turns large sections of the film into something that can only be watched with clinical detachment instead of with genuine feeling, and the fact that it doesn't really matter if the main characters live or die makes the movie, very, very boring.  As Rafe, Ben Affleck continues to demonstrate that he's little more than a good-looking store mannequin.  Kate Beckinsale, who's normally quite a good actress, puts in an equally wooden performance as Evelyn, as does Josh Hartnett as Danny.  Considering that these three are the leads of the film, that's just pathetic.As for the bombing of Pearl Harbor itself - well, even if you're willing to ignore the many historical inaccuracies, the bombing is handled with such inept direction that it's embarrassing.  Despite the fact that it technically looks very good, it's constructed in a manner that suggests adolescent glee, not somber reality.  The battle scenes of `Saving Private Ryan' were designed to evoke horror.  The sinking scenes in `Titanic' managed to evoke similar feelings of dread.  In `Pearl Harbor', there's nothing but cartoonish violence.  There's an attitude of `look how cool this is!' throughout the bombing that's completely inappropriate.  For example, during the destruction of the USS Arizona in the film, Michael Bay cuts to the reaction of a cook as a bomb strikes the ship . . . the cook gives a Buckwheat-esque reaction that belongs in a `Three Stooges' short.  When I saw this in the theater, the audience, for the most part, laughed heartily at the cook's reaction.  I'll only pose this question: Should anything at all about the destruction of the USS Arizona, where thousands died in senseless slaughter, be something to laugh at?  The actual bombing of Pearl Harbor seems to be little more to Bruckheimer and Bay than an excuse to make an action movie and to blow things up.  They rarely give the actual bombing - and its survivors - the respect they deserve, and their few attempts to actually do so are heavy-handed and pandering in nature.  In another director's hands, the story still would've been awful, but at least the tone of the film might've been on the mark.  Hopefully, Bay will never get another change to butcher a serious subject like this again, and will stick to stuff like `The Rock' from now on. Are there positives in this film?  There's some, I guess, but not enough to make `Peal Harbor' good.  Despite Michael Bay's mishandling of the tone of battle sequences, they are technically brilliant, and the effects work is outstanding.  (However, I get the feeling Bay should be paying out some cash to James Cameron, Terrence Malick, and Steven Spielberg for so shamelessly ripping shots from their films.  Bay is apparently turning into a new version of Brian DePalma - a technically brilliant director with no style of his own.)  Cuba Gooding Jr's performance as Dorie Miller is great . . . for the ten minutes he's actually in the movie.  It's nice, but he either needed to be a more significant character or cut from the film entirely.  Ditto the smaller roles of model James King as Nurse Betty, and Dan Ackroyd as Thurman - they're excellent, but underused.  Even though their performances are great, the overall film might've been better if losing the scenes using their characters meant trimming an hour off this already bloated film.  The only small role that was both outstanding and critical to the film was Jon Voight as FDR - he was inspiring to watch, and was one of the few important characters who didn't seem to be sleepwalking through the film.
If `Pearl Harbor' was a film about a completely fictional subject - like `Armageddon' - it would still be incredibly dull and mediocre, bordering on bad.  The fact that it deals with an important historical event brimming with true stories of heroism and tragedy makes the film `Pearl Harbor' even worse.  It's an insulting film that's not worth renting, let alone watching in the theater.  Grade: C-",5,1,1,1 June 2001
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Mythical Epic Brought To Life
","Jaw-dropping martial arts combined with a genuinely good story  `Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' delivers this nice blend, making for one of the best action movies  indeed, one of the best movies, period  made in the past few years.  Forget any possible negative preconceived notions that you might have about subtitled films, or about martial arts films, because `Crouching Tiger' is a flat-out great movie.`Crouching Tiger' is told in a fable-like manner, or a tale about the Knights of the Round Table  it's fairly simple, but very engaging.  The warrior Li Mu Bai (Chow Yun-Fat), a near-legendary hero, abruptly retires, giving his sword  the Green Destiny  over to the wise Sir Te (Pei-pei Cheng) for safekeeping.  Li Mu Bai has tired of the warrior's life, and wishes to begin pursing a future with the unrequited love of his life, Yu Shu Lien (Michelle Yeoh).  Before he can confess his love to Yu Shu Lien, though, the Green Destiny is stolen  at first, it is thought that Li Mu Bai's sworn enemy, the Jade Fox (Li Fazeng) has stolen the weapon, but it becomes readily apparent that a new, impetuous young warrior has stolen the weapon instead . . . the troubled daughter of a powerful, noble family, a girl named Jen (Zhang Ziyi.)   Woven in and out of the pursuit of the Green Destiny is romance, comedy, and some of the best wire-assisted martial arts work ever caught on film. For the most part, the wire-work martial arts is used in much the same way as digital effects were used in `Forrest Gump'  to enhance the story, not to be the story.  It adds nicely to the mythical, fairy-tale tone of the film  only towards the end of the movie does the effect start becoming unbelievable and obtrusive.  The choreographed fights are like Fred Astaire dance numbers, fluid, fast, and unbelievable to watch.  Both Michelle Yeoh and newcomer Zhang Ziyi are poetry in motion.  The look of the film is fantastic as well  with sweeping desert plains, the forests, the cities, director Ang Lee created an epic backdrop for `Crouching Tiger' that helps make the film an event as well as a story.Speaking of story, `Crouching Tiger' is a well-told tale, albeit a simple one.  Part of its charm is the simple backstory, which is hinted at but never explored.  It's casually mentioned, for example, that the old and wise Sir Te was once one of the greatest warriors in the kingdom  but it's left at that; it's enough to add depth to the story without beating the audience over the head with it.  The story moves along at a quick, exciting pace, except for one sequence regarding Jen that's awkwardly dropped into the middle of the film.  Well-paced and well thought out, `Crouching Tiger' is one of the best-told tales to be caught on film in quite a while.Michelle Yeoh and Chow Yun-Fat are excellent in this film (although I kept expecting Chow Yun-Fat to pull out a pair of nine-millimeter handguns and start blasting away at villains.)  Without question, though, Zhang Ziyi steals the movie as Jen  not only is she an astonishingly good martial artist, but she is undeniably a terrific actress as well.  She runs a gamut of emotions throughout `Crouching Tiger', flying between joyful elation to quiet sadness to screaming rage  her performance is nothing short of outstanding.  With any luck, Zhang Ziyi should someday become a top marquee name; she's that good.`Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' isn't a perfect film . . . but it comes darn close.

Driven," A Wildly Uneven Film
","'Driven' suffers from an unpolished script and witless direction, but despite the flaws, it's still decent.  Not good, not great, but decent. No amount of rewrites would ever make this a great film, but it comes close at times to being good.  In a way, it's more frustrating to see a film like this than a truly awful one, because there's so much promise for a movie like 'Driven' . . . but in the end, it falls well short of that promise.The story, written by Sylvester Stallone, is wildly uneven.  Good at times, awful at others, it plays out like a rough draft, still needing a little -- okay, a lot -- of polish.   Jimmy Bly (Kip Pardue) is a young race car driver with a lot of talent and a lot of uncertainties -- he's finding it difficult to deal with the pressures of being on top.  To help Jimmy deal with the pressure, his boss, Carl Henry (Burt Reynolds), enlists the help of retired racer Joe Tanto (Sylvester Stallone), to be a mentor and advisor to Jimmy.  Jimmy's ups and downs through the racing season are chronicled -- his relationships with Tanto, with his chief rival Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger), and with his weaselly brother (and agent) Demille (Robert Sean Leonard).There's certain moments of the story that border on being genuinely touching and brilliant -- Tanto's relationship with Brandenberg, for example, which could've easily degenerated into an overly cliched Rocky/Ivan Drago rivalry, is much more complex and interesting than expected.  Stallone does a good job of either avoiding the obvious cliches or putting a new spin on them, making for a neat story that comes across fresh, and not just a re-tread of 'Rocky'.  Other moments, though, defy common sense and hurt the film.  For example, the fact that Bly and Brandenburg constantly finished 1-2 in every single race is odd enough, but when Carl Henry starts implying that he'd fire Bly . . . come on!  The guy at least finishes second in every race! Who can you get who'll be better?  It becomes commonplace in 'Driven' to see characters act completely irrationally or against everything they've said in previous scenes to add conflict to a scene, and the lack of logic becomes tiresome and stupid.  Add into this car races that come across more as Playstation 2 fantasies instead of, well, real, and 'Driven' lurches unsteadily between magic and moronic in the space of seconds.Stallone's pretty good as Tanto -- he keeps faithful to his role as a mentor, staying a supporting character and wisely avoiding the chance to make himself the hero once more.  Burt Reynolds does well with the part of Carl Henry, not chewing the scenery (much).  The part's poorly written, but Reynolds makes the most of it.  The highlight of 'Driven' is Til Schweiger as Brandenburg, who transforms what could've been a stock guy-you-want-to-hate part into somebody who demands grudging respect. With any luck, Mr. Schweiger will be in many more mainstream films sometime soon. Unfortunately, he also does such a good job that he completely overshadows Kip Pardue as Jimmy Bly, who's supposed to be nervous and unsure of himself. . . but instead, he just comes across as a whiner.  Considering that Bly's also supposed to be the hero of 'Driven', the weak performance hurts the film.  (Special mention: Gina Gershon as Tanto's bitchy ex-wife Cathy. Tiny part, but man, is she awesome.)And then, there's the direction.  A federal law should be passed barring Renny Harlin from ever directing another motion picture ever again.  With obscenely fast camera cuts, a blaring, overly loud soundtrack, and scene set-ups that simply defy all logic, Mr. Harlin has taken the concept of pacing a story and cheerfully bludgeoned it to death.  There's little time to sit back and enjoy some of the quieter scenes in 'Driven', and sadly, it's these little moments that actually make the film enjoyable. Everything is presented at such an urgent, frenetic pace; it's easy to stop caring about the scenes that actually need to be urgent.  'Driven' would've benefited greatly from the presence of a different director -- it's that bad.With the benefit of another rewrite (and another scriptwriter), and especially another director -- one with a shred of talent -- 'Driven' could've been good.  Instead, the high points and low points average out to a very, very mediocre film.  It's a shame.  Grade:  C+",6,1,1,1 May 2001
Mission: Impossible II," Good, But It's Watered-Down Woo
","`Mission: Impossible 2', on the surface, is a very good  not great  action movie.  Yes, it's kind of formulaic, but truly original action films are hard to come by.  `M:I2' covers all its bases, keeps the plot holes to a minimum, and avoids using too many of the standard cliches that litter the action genre.  It's a popcorn movie, pure and simple, and in terms of pure entertainment, it delivers fairly well.I say that `on the surface' it's very good because . . . man, what a waste of director John Woo's talents.  This film had the potential to be absolutely mind-blowing in terms of action, effects, and fights, and instead, well, it's just good.  People unfamiliar with John Woo's Hong Kong films (`The Killer', `Hardboiled', `A Better Tomorrow', and so on) might think the action sequences of `M:I2' stand out as spectacular  and if they do, great, because then they're enjoying the flick  but for the most part, `M:I2' pales in comparison to Woo's Hong Kong films, despite `M:I2's bigger budget and stars.  (The only scenes that come close to Woo's best work are the opening rock-climbing sequence and a chase scene involving motorcycles.) Woo's Hollywood films never seem to hit the over-the-top intensity of his Hong Kong work; if the Hollywood brass is toning Woo down for a mainstream audience, they're making a huge mistake. The film is wall-to-wall action, and for the most part, it's darn good action, but good as it was, it could've been way, way better. The story's okay  it deals with the hunt for a stolen bio-toxin, but it's really just an excuse to string a whole bunch of cool stuff together.  Tom Cruise as Ethan Hunt is fine, and he seems to have fun with the role, but he's not exactly an engaging action hero  he doesn't come close to Pierce Brosnan as James Bond, or, for that matter, Bruce Willis as John McClane. Ving Rhames' reprisal of his role as Hunt's partner Luther is quite welcome  he's excellent, as usual.  Dougray Scott is pretty good as villain Sean Ambrose, but the biggest waste is Thandie Newton as Nyah, who's given little to do but serve as eye candy.  Yes, Ms. Newton is quite beautiful, but the lady can actually act as well, so a role such as this is an utter waste of her talents.  Cruise (as producer) could've cast any one of a dozen Victoria's Secret models as Nyah and gotten the same results.Basically, `M:I2' is a fun film, definitely worth renting if you're a casual action movie fan.   If you're a die hard John Woo, fan, though, be prepared for some slight disappointment.  Grade: B",7,0,0,30 April 2001
The Mummy Returns," So Unoriginal, It Borders On Kleptomania
","`The Mummy Returns' suffers from heavy-handed thievery.  It's probably a terrific movie if you've never seen any other movies before in your life, or if you've been living in a cave for the past twenty-five years, but if you don't meet the above criteria, then you're in for a bland, shameless rehash of a dozen other action movies that are better than `The Mummy Returns'. Combine this with a rather dull story and shoddy CGI effects, and you've got the first forgettable, must-miss blockbuster of 2001.Ten years after the events of `The Mummy' ended (`The Mummy', incidentally, was a fun, much superior film to this dreck), we find erstwhile adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan Frasier) married to his tempestuous love Evelyn (Rachel Weisz), living in London and leading relatively normal lives.  (The fact that such characters could ever contemplate living normal lives is possibly the only original part of the film.) However, fate and a heavy-handed script conspire to bring the body of the Mummy Imhotep (Arnold Vosloo) to the British Museum.  Once again, the Mummy Imhotep awakens, determined to live again and bring about the destruction of the world. Only Rick, Evelyn, and their 9-year old son Alex (Freddie Boath) can defeat the Mummy and save the world for impending doom.  Blah, blah, blah.`The Mummy Returns' is wall-to-wall action, but that's probably due to necessity, since the movie doesn't have anything to say.  Action can be fun in its own right, but great action usually at least has a semblance of a story as its backbone, and `The Mummy Returns' usually has nothing.  When it does have something to say, it's cribbed straight out of `Indiana Jones'. Or `Romancing the Stone'. Or occasionally, when it's feeling ambitious, it stretches back to steal from Errol Flynn classics such as `Captain Blood'. There's no new twists in `The Mummy Returns', nothing that hasn't already been seen in a hundred other actions movies before . . . and definitely nothing that hasn't already been seen in its infinitely better predecessor, `The Mummy'.  Yes, some of the fight scenes are spectacular  a flashback fight between Evelyn and the Egyptian princess Anck-Su-Namun (Patricia Velasquez) is particularly outstanding  and the action makes for some over-the-top fun; but after awhile, it's simply gratuitous, mildly exciting filler.  (And the CGI work is uneven  while it's probably fun for the programmers to dream this cutting-edge stuff up, it still looks jarringly fake.) It's fun, even dumb fun, but dumb fun has been done in other films, and in much better films than `The Mummy Returns'.Performances:  Brendan Frasier is pretty good, but his character Rick is more or less a mechanism for delivering quips and punchlines, nothing more. Rachel Weisz, whose character is much stronger than she was in the first `Mummy' film, is actually quite good  she blends the cliched damsel-in-distress role with a certain amount of feistiness and sarcasm that makes her very, very appealing.  Arnold Vosloo is wasted yet again as the Mummy  all the guy does is sneer and flex his muscles.  The Mummy's not scary, he's boring cardboard.`The Mummy Returns' isn't nearly as good as `The Mummy'.  Then again, it's not nearly good, period.  Possibly worth watching if in you're in a mood for idiotic fun, but even then, you can do much better than this needless waste of film.  Grade:  C-",4,1,1,4 May 2001
Eyes Wide Shut," Made Twenty Years Too Late
","'Eyes Wide Shut' might have been considered director Stanley Kubrick's most controversial masterpiece . . . if he'd filmed it in the early 1980's, as he originally intended.  While artistically and visually brilliant, 'Eyes Wide Shut' suffers from relying on a script that would've been considered daring and shocking in years gone by, but for 1999 and beyond it offers nothing particularly outrageous.  With little substance behind the intended shock, the film is left with little else to entertain the audience.  It's kind of like watching 'Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?' or even 'Basic Instinct' today -- at the time those films were released, they pushed a lot of emotional buttons, but now the issues and topics they dealt with seems rather tame.
The film deals with the relationship between Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise) and his wife, Alice Harford (Nicole Kidman), a wealthy, happily married couple with a small, lovely daughter (Madison Eginton).  However, in an awkward moment Alice confesses to William that she considered cheating on him early on in their marriage.  She never actually acting on her adulterous thoughts, but William becomes so enraged that he goes out alone into the night, contemplating the future of his marriage and looking for a random sexual encounter with which he can gain a certain amount of revenge.And that's it.  There's a lot of scenes (some imagined, some real) of kinky sexual encounters, but nothing incredibly over the top, nothing that hasn't been seen in mainstream films before.  William's reaction to his wife's confession seems entirely too strong.  No, I don't think that any man ever wants to hear from his wife that she thought about having an affair with somebody else, but to react as strongly as he did seemed slightly odd.  If she'd actually had the affair, it might've made more sense.  Scenes that could've been built into dark, brooding, tormented sequences of William agonizing over what to do often seem pointless because of this . . . and over two hours' worth of them is mind-numbingly boring overkill.There's still a few highlights -- Cruise puts in a solid performance, considering the material he has to work with, and Kidman actually shines in what really is a supporting role as Alice.  Also, the mood, the camera angles, the odd lighting -- in terms of technique, the film ranks as one of Kubrick's finest efforts.  Considering all the hype that went along with this film, though, it's very disappointing, and even on its own merits, it's average at best.  Decent fare for a Kubrick fan, but otherwise, don't bother.  C-",5,3,6,19 April 2001
Titanic," Overrated? Slightly, But Not By Much
","`Titanic' has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made, and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but puerile, overrated garbage.  The truth lies somewhere in between - `Titanic' definitely shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar in 1997 (), but to dismiss the film as utter crap is very unfair.  `Titanic' tells a complex tale, and, for the most part, tells it very well.  The fact that parts of this tale are either predictable or flawed shouldn't be ignored, but it also isn't enough to turn `Titanic' into a rotten movie. `Titanic' has a slightly predictable story, but most films involving a well-known historical event tend to be predictable.  Before the movie even starts, anybody watching `Titanic' should be able to predict a few things: The Titanic will set sail in glorious fashion, with its owners grandly proclaiming its unsinkable nature; there will be a story about the passengers, some fictional, some real; the Titanic will sink in a slow and horrible fashion; and while the ship sinks, the characters will be forced to deal with their own mortality, and some will be heroes while others will be craven cowards.  See?  Predictable.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that the historical nature of `Titanic' dictates this story structure. After all, it's the structure James Cameron actually uses.  But the execution of that structure . . . well, that takes some talent, if the film has any aspirations of being good.  It means blending action, romance, drama, and historical accuracy.  And James Cameron blends them all splendidly.The main story concerns a young girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), traveling to America in order marry an arrogant millionaire named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  The marriage, which has been arranged by her formerly rich and now-destitute mother (Frances Fisher), is abhorrent to Rose, so in a desperate attempt to escape her fate, she attempts to jump off the ship.  Of course, she doesn't jump, but is instead saved by the happy-go-lucky Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and of course the two begin a brief, if implausible, romance.  This romance, which is perhaps the weakest part of `Titanic' is still vitally important to the story . . . because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg, and about the choices they make. Could it have been better?  Absolutely.  But considering that the romance is a means to an end, rather than the end itself, it's not bad.DiCaprio is superb as the wide-eyed vagabond Jack Dawson - he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why Rose would fall in love so quickly with him.  Winslet's slightly less believable, though; she's good, but not great.  She puts in a nice, quiet, restrained performance, but it's so restrained at times that it borders on comatose. It's actually the minor characters that add some zip to `Titanic' - Billy Zane is outstanding as the villain Hockley, as he gives Hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed, arrogant person, and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a Flash Gordon serial.  Also worthy of note is the modern-day interaction between deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the Titanic.  No only does their interaction serve as a brilliant, unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the Titanic's final hours to the audience, but Paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience - as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting, it's a neat touch to see his character Lovett become more and more fascinated with Rose's stories.It would be remiss not to mention the special effects of `Titanic', which by and large is the film's strength. While the ship (and its sinking) is a product of CGI effects and model works, it's done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself, or reminds the audience that they're watching a movie. Of more importance is that the film's effects, while spectacular, never ARE the film - they always SUPPORT the film's story.There are many things to nit-pick about `Titanic' (although I find it hard to believe that people really nit-pick the minor historical inaccuracies of the film; Cameron got all the major details right, and the films probably more than 95% accurate, for crying out loud).  But those problems are nit-picks - very tiny but slightly irritating details, nothing more.  They keep the film from being an all-time great, but they certainly don't make it a bad film.  The blend of romance, action, history, and special effects probably explains the film's vast appeal - there's certainly something for everyone in this film - and it also makes `Titanic' an excellent, if not perfect, movie.

Die Hard," The Perfect Modern Action Film
","'Die Hard' is the prototype type for the modern action film.  Since it's also one of the best action films ever made, that happens to be a very good thing.  'Die Hard' is lean, mean, and doesn't contain a single second of wasted screen time. The direction, the action, the story, the acting . . . every aspect of this film comes close to big-budget action movie perfection. Since 'Die Hard' was first released in 1988, it's difficult to think of a blockbuster action film that doesn't follow the basic structure and format of 'Die Hard' . . . or, for that matter, is better than 'Die Hard'.
'Die Hard' is about John McClane (Bruce Willis, in one of his all-time best film performances), a basically good, honest New York cop with a penchant for annoying authority figures.   Traveling to Los Angeles in a last ditch attempt to patch things up with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia), John McClane suddenly finds himself involved in a hostage situation. Terrorists, led by the enigmatic Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman), have taken over the office building in which Holly is working, and with Gruber holding the upper hand over the LAPD and FBI forces in Los Angeles, it's up to John McClane to save the day . . . .Kudos should be given to both director John McTiernan and screenwriters Jeb Stuart and Steven DeSouza -- the film is tight, electrifying, and clever, which is something few action films can ever claim.  The story isn't completely believable, but it's believable enough, and it manages to move along at a quick enough pace to where the most glaring plotholes can easily be glossed over.  There's also enough twists and wrinkles thrown into the story to keep the audience guessing as to what's going to happen next . . . and the surprises don't come out of left field, but are actually clever and well thought-out.  (The fact that McClane often relies on his brains instead of his bullets to get out of his predicaments is also a big plus.) Simply put, 'Die Hard' is one of the smartest and savviest action screenplays ever written.  McTiernan holds up his end of the film admirably as well -- he uses the claustrophobic nature of the office building to great effect (particularly in any scene involving an elevator shaft), and he keeps the film rolling at a rollercoaster pace, building up the anticipation of the audience before unleashing the action.  A lot of recent action films just fly along at a mindless, breakneck pace, without ever allowing the story to breathe or the suspense to build . . . unlike those films, 'Die Hard' knows how to maximize the impact of each and every scene, and that's why it stands out so clearly from them all.  With 'Die Hard', John McTiernan puts on a perfect clinic as to how to pace an action movie.As for the acting, it's darn near close to perfect.  Bruce Willis is awesome as John McClane.  As played by Willis, McClane's a smartass with a distinct disdain for being given orders . . . but McClane's also clever, and knows how to keep cool under pressure.  There's more to McClane than the stereotypical tough guy hero.  Fortunately, the role was given to Bruce Willis, who infuses McClane with the perfect mix of cocky arrogance and stone-cold heroism.  The fact that Willis plays McClane as a man often in disbelief of his own situation, and who struggles in his fight against bad guys instead of just killing bad guys with ease, like most stereotypical action heroes -- well, not only does it make the character much more believable, it's darn brilliant.  (The fact that Willis also knows how to deliver a deadpan one-liner better than anybody else in Hollywood makes the character all the better.)  There's only a handful of movies where both character and actor are a completely perfect match; Bruce Willis as John McClane is one such perfect match.Also worthy of mention is Alan Rickman's performance as the villain Hans Gruber.  The Machiavellian Gruber would've been an easy villain to turn into little more than a scenery-chewing Bond villain . . . fortunately, Rickman doesn't travel the easy route.  Gruber, as played by Rickman, is cold and calculating, and actually acts smart, instead of merely claiming to be smart and then being thoroughly outwitted by the hero.  He always appears to have an ace hidden up his sleeve, and is so convincing at giving this impression, it's hard to tell throughout the film whether he or McClane truly have the upper hand.  Other actors probably could've played Gruber fairly well, but Rickman makes Gruber one of the all-time great villains.  As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty good.  Bonnie Bedelia does a nice job as John's soon-to-be-ex-wife Holly -- she plays her with enough smarts and feistiness to break the usual 'damsel in distress' mold.  It's also worth mentioning that Paul Gleason, who plays the obstinate police chief Robinson, pretty much sets up the modern action movie stereotype of the authority figure who refuses to heed the advice of the maverick hero.  The character is stupid to a fault, and he's wonderful because of it.'Die Hard' is a terrific example of what happens when all the pieces of a film fall together perfectly.  There simply are no weak spots or dull moments in the film.  Is 'Die Hard' one of the best overall movies ever made?  Probably not.  But it's undeniably one of the best action movies ever made, and it just might well be the perfect modern action film.  Grade: A",9,347,464,31 July 2001
Con Air," A Good Movie That Got Bogged Down With Greed
","`Con Air' more or less defines the term `popcorn movie'  it's an action film designed strictly to entertain.  The film's emphasis is on flash, flair, and adrenaline, with a smattering of humor and story spread throughout for good measure.  Not exactly the most lofty of goals, but the desire to entertain is quite sincere, and `Con Air' does largely succeed in the entertainment department.Where `Con Air' falls apart, however, is the grandiose, grandstanding way in which it tells its story.  Subtlety is a word that is impossible to use in describing this film.  `Con Air' is a firm believer in the concept that more must be better  ten explosions must be better than one; three psychotic villains must be better than two; and so on.  The `bigger is better' approach never truly turns the film into an utter mess, but it does bog it down to a certain extent  what could've been a fantastic action movie becomes, well, just better than average.  A leaner and meaner `Con Air' could've been a classic.`Con Air' is the story of good-guy Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), an Army Ranger unjustly tossed in prison for eight long years for protecting his family from a drunken, knife-wielding maniac. Finally paroled, Poe is placed on a converted troop transport plane that will take him home to his family. However, also on board the plane is a roster of psychotic criminals vaguely reminiscent of the Legion of Doom from the old `Superfriends' cartoon. There's Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich), an articulate, thoughtful madman with a penchant for automatic weapons; Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), a black militant and Cyrus' trusted lieutenant (or so Cyrus thinks, at any rate); Johnny 23 (Danny Trejo), a serial rapist; Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi), a serial killer in the Hannibal Lecter vein who is treated as the resident prison celebrity; and a good half-dozen other colorful characters to flesh out this flying rogues' gallery of nightmare criminals.  Under Cyrus' direction, the criminals take control of the plane, and it's up to the beleaguered Poe to save the day, with some help from good-guy U.S. Marshal Larkin (John Cusack) on the ground, who's seemingly the only person in U.S. law enforcement capable of deciphering Poe's brief and cryptic messages to the authorities.The film moves along at a brisk pace, cheerfully glossing over its own improbabilities.  `Con Air' is definitely the kind of film that only works if you don't stop to think about it, and director Simon West keeps things going quick enough to keep most of the ludicrous plot holes mercifully brief.  He manages to cut from one story arc to another with a certain amount of skill, keeping each arc from completely snowballing into something unmanageable.  However, the juggling act wears thin by the end of the movie  there's simply too much to try to balance.  It's not particularly Simon West's fault (although he does have an annoying penchant for overusing the slow-motion explosion filmed from five different angles, a lá `The A-Team'), but more a by-product of the script. The second half of the film has forced moments, where the only purpose of the action scenes seems to be to completely outdo the action scenes in the first half.  These scenes are undeniably cool looking, but they're filler, and filler can only take a movie so far.  A good third of the film  story, action scenes, you name it  could've easily been excised from the film, and not only would it never be missed, `Con Air' would actually be vastly improved.
Even the characters, while entertaining, wind up just overwhelming the film. The villain Diamond Dog, as played by Ving Rhames, is charismatic, menacing, and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . and he's also completely gratuitous.  As Cyrus the Virus, John Malkovich is also charismatic, menacing, and a truly inspired movie bad guy . . . just like Diamond Dog. The movie simply doesn't have room for both villains (and it definitely doesn't have room for the Lecter-inspired Garland Green, who Steve Buscemi turns into an odd sort of comic relief, but otherwise serves no purpose in the film.)  ONE villain would've been plenty.  Ditto the heroes: Cage is good, Cusack is good, but c'mon, pick ONE.  Like the rest of the film, the characters become too much, and wind up becoming pure overkill.In many ways, `Con Air' looks like the results of a Hollywood brainstorming meeting gone haywire, where a thousand ideas are slapped down onto a notepad. . . but these ideas don't necessarily mesh well together.  Most of the ideas in `Con Air' are surprisingly decent, there's just too many of them. (How many times have you heard that about an action movie?)Overall, `Con Air' is okay, and if you're in the mood for fun, mindless action, it gets the job done.  Personally, I'd recommend watching `The Rock' instead it's by far the best of the recent spate of Bruckheimer action flicks  but  `Con Air', for all its excesses, has its own good moments, too.

Kingpin," And You Call Yourselves A Bowling Alley?
","Just on principle, any movie about Amish bowlers should be funny. 'Kingpin', which is a Farrelly Brothers film about an Amish bowler, is not only howlingly funny, it's also sick, twisted, and one of the most underrated comedies of recent years.  While not quite up to the lowbrow genius of the Farrelly Brothers' other films ('Dumb and Dumber', 'There's Something About Mary'), there's enough crude humor blended with a genuinely engaging story to create a film that's remarkably good.Roy Munson (Woody Harrelson) is a promising young bowling champion who has the audacity to defeat the king of the local lanes, Ernie McCracken  (Bill Murray, in a delightfully sleazy, love-to-hate role). Ernie decides that Roy needs to learn a lesson in manners, one thing leads to another Three Stooges style, and Roy's bowling career is suddenly ended by a freakish injury, one which costs him his bowling hand.  (The sheer fact that the manner in which this is done is hysterically funny is a tribute to the Farrelly Brothers' gift for comedy.)  Fast forward ten years to a fat, bitter, and balding Roy, who suddenly spots Ishmael Boorg , a kid with a real gift for bowling . . . a sweet, innocent, Amish kid.  Roy takes the kid under his wing, and in a crude, darkly funny series of events that oddly seems to parody 'The Color of Money', Roy begins to teach the kid about bowling . . . and about life.'Kingpin' isn't exactly the most intelligent comedy ever made -- one of the best jokes in the film involves X's efforts to milk a bull -- but it is darn funny.  Like other Farrelly Brothers films. there's also a certain level of sweetness mixed in with all the bawdy humor, which gives the film some depth and makes it more than just a 90 minute R-rated Three Stooges routine.  As stupid as some of these characters are -- and there's plenty of stupid to pass around in 'Kingpin' -- you actually care about what happens to them. They aren't just walking punchlines.Of special mention is Bill Murray, who brings new dimensions to the word slime.  With his sequined shirts, plastered comb-over, and condescending sneer, Murray looks and acts like a cross between a used car salesman and Hitler.  As Ernie McCracken , Murray relishes being loathed and hated, and man, he gives you plenty of hilarious reasons to hate him.Highly recommended, if you appreciate fun, dumb, politically incorrect jokes.

Scream," Hate To Admit It, But It's Great
","There's more than a few reasons to hate `Scream'; the main reason would be that the film single-handedly resurrected the teen-slasher genre, a movie category that had long been beaten to death.  Because of the success of `Scream', witless horror crap like `I Know What You Did Last Summer' and `Urban Legend' got greenlighted, half the teenage casts of various WB television shows got summer acting jobs, and some awful scripts that should've been left dead and buried `Teaching Mrs. Tingle' got to see the light of day.  `Scream' is responsible for a lot of garbage.  But the truth of the matter is, `Scream' is also a phenomenal movie.The plot of `Scream' is very simple: a masked knife-wielding maniac is busy stalking the students of High, killing them off one by one.  The killer's inordinately obsessed with one girl, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who of course gets involved in the quest to unmask the killer.  The catch (in case you don't already know it), though, is brilliant.  Everyone in the film is familiar with all the slasher film conventions.  They know that you shouldn't walk in the woods alone at night.  They know that having wild sex is an unwritten invitation to be hacked to pieces.  They know not to say things to each other like `I'm going outside for a cigarette; I'll be right back.' -- such statements are virtual death warrants.   One of the best examples (and best characters) of this is Randy (Jamie Kennedy), the film-obsessed nut of the film, who actually goes so far as to muse what `real' actors and actresses should play the other characters in the film, going so far as to joke about who gets to be Tori Spelling.  All the dumb conventions of slasher films are pulled out of the shadows, exposed for what they really are . . . and then, some of them get used anyway, because the characters willingly choose to ignore those conventions.  Some cliches are thrown away, while others are embraced.  `Scream' really turned the horror/slasher film genre on its ear, becoming the first truly suspenseful and exciting slasher film in many, many years simply because it suddenly had a million new avenues to explore.  The film's self-awareness allowed to move in brand-new directions . . . and suddenly, scenes that used to be predictable in other slasher films suddenly become incredibly intense in `Scream'.Director Wes Craven was perfect for this film -- as director of slasher classics like `Nightmare On Elm Street', he easily sets the visual feels and style of film to perfect evoke all the slasher films of yore . . . and then, much like `Scream's' script, chooses to either faithfully follow the tried and true, or to go off in competely unexpected directions.  Either way, Craven manages to create a lot of absolutely nail-biting, thrilling scenes. He also doesn't hold back with the gore, which is always a plus in great slasher films.  The acting ranges from barely mediocre to good -- Neve Campbell's okay as Sidney; Courtney Cox is pretty good as tart-tongued reporter Gail Weathers; Jamie Kennedy rules as Randy the film geek; and David Arquette is utterly bland and forgettable as Deputy Dewey Riley, the sad-sack policeman.  But casts in slasher films don't particularly matter anyway; the good ones are all about suspense, terror, and gore.  And in `Scream', Wes Craven provides massive amounts of all three of those criteria.The irony is, `Scream' spawned dozens of imitators, and by spawning imitators, all the new avenues opened up by `Scream' quickly got old and boring once more.  Still, purely on its own merit, it's an excellent film. The best slasher film of all time is still John Carpenter's `Halloween', without question, but `Scream' actually runs a close second.  It's well worth watching.  Grade:  A-",8,230,273,9 May 2001
Halloween," The Template For The Modern Slasher Film
","John Carpenter's 'Halloween' still stands out today as the best horror slasher film of all time, and it's certainly still the standard that all other slasher films copy shamelessly.  To be fair, 'Halloween' isn't exactly a paragon of originality -- it borrows heavily from Hitchcock's 'Psycho', Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead', and a  number of the later Universal 'Frankenstein' flicks, where the Frankenstein monster wandered aimlessly through castle corridors trying to kill people -- but it's the first film to distill all the elements of the slasher genre into a lean, mean core.  Other slasher films since 'Halloween' have tinkered around with the elements of this core, trying to improve upon it . . . but so far, none of these other contenders and pretenders have come close to succeeding.   Despite its distinct low-budget look, 'Halloween', by far, is still the most chilling, scary slasher film ever made. 
'Halloween' features a very simple but well-done story: Years ago, on a fateful Halloween night, a young boy named Michael Myers puts on a rubber mask and savagely kills his sister with a butcher's knife. Michael is shipped off to a psychiatric facility, where is diagnosed as a sociopath -- an emotionless killer with no concept of right or wrong.  For fifteen years, he's held and studied there . . . until again, on a Halloween night, he manages to escape from captivity. He heads back to his hometown with a new mask and a new knife, ready to begin a brand-new killing spree back in his unsuspecting hometown . . .Written by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, 'Halloween' works so well mainly because it keeps all details to a minimum.  No motivation is provided for WHY Michael Myers is a bloodthirsty knife-wielding maniac, but then again, one isn't needed.  The film works just fine with the basic fact that Michael Myers is an evil killing machine.  The same goes for the teenage characters/victims in 'Halloween', particularly the character of Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) -- these characters are developed just enough for the audience to get to know them, and more importantly, get to sympathize with them.  Once the audience starts thinking of the characters as genuine, likable people -- BAM.  Michael Myers shows up in full-on death mode, making the audience care about what actually happens to these terrorized characters.  It's a great technique for building fear and suspense, one that John Carpenter pulls off perfectly . . . . and one that's been lost with more recent slasher films.  Nobody cares if the Killer Du Jour of 'Generic Slasher Film' starts butchering the unlikable characters, because the audience doesn't care if the unlikable characters die. With 'Halloween', the audience cares, which is one of the reasons why it's such a good film.
Another technique used by Carpenter that gets overlooked today is how the story moves along at such a rapid-fire pace.  'Halloween' takes place in a single night, with Michael Myers moving and killing at a relentless pace. Sure, the other characters do dumb things -- sometimes, they make it almost entirely too convenient for Michael Myers to slit their throats -- but at least the stupidity is plausible, simply because neither they nor the audience is given time to think about what's happening.  The characters don't have time for logic; they're running instead on pure animal instinct, and that instinct is often wrong.  Compare that to later drivel like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer', where the characters essentially wait around their hometown for weeks, waiting to be picked off by a knife-wielding maniac . . . stupid.  Those characters had time to think and to properly assess their situation.  The characters in 'Halloween' aren't given the luxury of time, making their panic and irrational behavior all the more believable -- and making the film all the more terrifying.There's other items as well that set 'Halloween' apart from all other slasher movies, or at least mark it as an original -- Carpenter's claustrophobic use of Steadicam to give the film a nervous, uneasy edge; the fact that 'Halloween' lacks a sense of humor and treats its story with deadly seriousness, unlike the smug, smarmy, slasher films of recent years; or the creepy way that Carpenter has Michael Myers moving through the background of otherwise innocuous scenes.  The bottom line, though, is that 'Halloween' pulls all the right elements together -- and then assembles them together flawlessly -- to form the perfect slasher film.  I'll be honest -- if you don't like the slasher genre, then you probably won't like 'Halloween'.  However, if you do like the slasher genre -- or have never seen a slasher film -- then I highly recommend 'Halloween'.  Without a doubt, it's simply the best film of its kind.

Shrek," A Hilarious Movie, Though It Has Some Mixed Signals
","'Shrek' is a laugh-out-loud, incredibly funny movie that manages to savagely shred the saccharine-sweet Disney film formula throughout most of its scenes.  Inexplicably, though, it suddenly embraces that same sweet Disney formula as it draws to a close . . . becoming, in many ways, exactly like the films it professes to mock.  'Shrek' tries to straddle the line between savvy adult-based humor and sweet family-friendly humor, usually succeeding, but failing miserably in certain spots.  Apparently, the strategy of aiming the film towards both kids and adults worked -- if judging from box-office revenue is any indication, `Shrek' was wildly successful -- but the quality of the film is dropped a notch or two by the occasionally awkward blending of adult satire and child sensibilities.  'Shrek' is still a very, very good -- and very, very funny -- film, but it could've either been a classic adult satire or a classic kid's movie, if only the producers of 'Shrek' had fully committed to pushing the film in one direction or the other, instead of just compromising to appeal to the masses.'Shrek' is the story of a lone ogre (aptly named, well, 'Shrek' -- and voiced by Mike Myers) whose major goal in life is to live in solitude in his beloved swamp.  This goal is somewhat thwarted by the ruler of the kingdom, Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow), a diminutive, evil tyrant who is forcing all the fairy tale characters in his kingdom to relocate to Shrek's swamp.  Shrek, unhappy with this relocation program, makes an offer to Farquaad -- he'll find Lord Farquaad a princess, which will allow Farquaad to get married and become a King.  All that Shrek wants in return is his swamp to be made like it was before --empty. Lord Farquaad accepts Shrek's offer -- so, along with his loquacious sidekick Donkey (voice by Eddie Murphy), Shrek begins a quest to find a true damsel in distress -- the lovely Princess Fiona (voiced by Cameron Diaz).With the possible exception of the 'South Park' movie, never has a film managed to so gleefully and successfully tear apart the Disney tradition of animated musicals as well as 'Shrek'.  Scenes are set up in the traditional Disney manner, then shredded with such razor-sharp wit and flair; it's amazingly funny.  The humor ranges from over-the-top (Princess Fiona's singing causes a bluebird to explode) to the wickedly subtle (the Magic Mirror's description of Snow White: 'She may live with seven men, but don't be fooled . . . she's not easy.')  'Shrek' veers wildly between loving reverence and sneering disdain for the traditions of Disney animated films -- the reverent scenes will most likely appeal more to kids, while adults will definitely appreciate those of disdain -- but regardless of the tone, the structure and the direction of 'Shrek' is usually incredibly funny.  It doesn't hurt that the cast of voices adds immeasurably to the film, either: Mike Myers plays the ogre Shrek with an oddly peculiar but funny amount of patience and practicality (I also suspect he only agreed to the part so he'd have another venue for his outrageous Scottish accent); John Lithgow is perfect as the pompous, overbearing Lord Farquaad; and Cameron Diaz manages to bring just the right amount of outrage and sweetness to Princess Fiona -- I found her to be the best character in the film.  Personally, I found Eddie Murphy (as Donkey) to be the most annoying character in the film -- true, he is very funny, and has some of the best lines, but he's a little too much to take at times.  The first third of the movie, he was brilliantly funny; the second third of the film, only mildly funny; and by the last third of the film, just irritating.  I don't fault Eddie Murphy at all for this, but I do fault directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson for not toning the character down.The main fault with `Shrek', though, lies in the fact that it tries to appeal to two distinct audiences.  It's not that such a feat can't be done (Disney's 'Aladdin', actually, does this flawlessly), but that 'Shrek' juggles between the two audiences so poorly.  For example, one of the 'big messages' being delivered to children by this film is that appearances don't matter, that people shouldn't be judged by how they look . . . and then a significant amount of time is spent ridiculing Lord Farquaad's small stature.  What gives?  When the two aspects of a film like this -- the child aspect and the adult aspect -- can exist simultaneously and separately, the results can be wonderful.  'Aladdin' is a prime example of this, as are nearly all of the Chuck Jones-directed 'Bugs Bunny' cartoons of the early 1950s.  When the aspects start contradicting each other, though, it's confusing, and not very funny.  As it affects 'Shrek', the contradictions aren't enough to significantly drag the film down, but they are quite noticeable, and they do cause the film to stumble.  (And another thing . . . okay, a minor rant . . . please, enough with 'The Matrix' parodies.  They're officially now like all those stupid 'I'm so scared' Blair Witch parodies .. . not even remotely funny.  Stop beating the dead horse.) 
Regardless of the mixed messages, there's no denying that 'Shrek' is a very clever, funny movie that will no doubt be entertaining for both children and adults.  There will be a few moments, though, when kids will be utterly puzzled by what's occurring in the film . . . and other moments that will have adults gagging from the nauseating sweetness.  Still, 'Shrek' is very, very good, and in the end, maybe that's all that really matters.  It's certainly better than most standard Disney fare, and is still the best animated film of 2001 . . . not too shabby, huh?  Grade: B+",7,0,0,31 August 2001
The Emperor's New Groove," Monty Python Meets Walt Disney
","The recent spate of animated films from Disney, beginning with `The Little Mermaid', have become the modern-day versions of the Hollywood musical. These Disney films, while sweet, are more or less formulaic in nature - they feature a plucky young hero (usually a heroine), a love interest, a wacky sidekick, and a good half-dozen or so schmaltzy songs from the likes of Elton John or Phil Collins.  While there's nothing wrong to this - `Beauty and the Beast' is a phenomenal film, as is `The Lion King' and `Aladdin' - it is a formula, nonetheless, and as such it leads to certain expectations when watching an animated Disney feature.`The Emperor's New Groove' lives up to none of these expectations.  As it turns out, this is a very, very good thing.  Despite lacking the traditional Disney film structure, `The Emperor's New Groove' is equal parts zany, silly, funny, clever, funny, and witty.  (Did I mention funny?) Apparently, while trying to channel the spirit of Walt Disney for `The Emperor's New Groove', director Mark Dindal and his animation team accidentally channeled the spirit of Tex Avery instead.  The film has a wonderfully absurd sensibility to it, where instead of watering down a simple story to entertain small children, it remains razor sharp, appealing on one level to kids . . . and on a totally different level to adults.  `The Emperor's New Groove', in its own way, is a homage to all those great Warner Brothers of yore created by Michael Maltese and Chuck Jones - as bizarre as it may seem, the classic `Rabbit Season! Duck Season!' cartoon would not be out of place in a film like this.  (Also, there is a squirrel in this film that seems to have literally wandered in from a Droopy Dog cartoon; it certainly possesses the wicked self-awareness of a Tex Avery character).Eschewing the idea that a hero must be likable, `The Emperor's New Groove' focuses, quite naturally, on the Emperor Kuzco (voiced by David Spade), the supreme ruler over a long-ago kingdom (presumably part of the Incan Empire, although that's never clearly stated).  Kuzco, who, much like Spade himself, is sarcasm incarnate, succeeds in annoying two important characters in the first few minutes of the film.  The first is the peasant Pacha (voiced by John Goodman), who is informed by Kuzco that his family's small house is to be demolished so that a pleasure palace called `Kuzcotopia' call be built in its place.  The second is Kuzco's treacherous advisor/sorceress Yzma (voiced by Eartha Kitt), who is pleasantly informed by Kuzco that the kingdom is `downsizing' and that her services are no longer needed.   Pacha takes his bad news with stoic, humble grace; but the evil Yzma decides that in order to save her job and become de facto ruler of the kingdom, she must kill Kuzco.  This being a Disney cartoon, she fails miserably in her assassination attempt, but does manage to magically transform Kuzco into a talking llama.  Kuzco the llama, still sarcastic but no longer omnipotent, finds himself cast out into the wilderness of his kingdom . . . and through a strange series of events, suddenly finds himself relying on the kindhearted, humble Pacha for help.The story's simple, but that's okay, since it's merely an excuse to string together a veritable calvacade of jokes, ranging from broad slapstick to rapier-sharp verbal wit.  The film never overtly tries to tug at the heartstrings of the audience - instead, it usually goes for the quick wisecrack or the funny sight gag, and if a few heartstrings are pulled in the process, well, that's just fine. 'The Emperor's New Groove' is almost Disney with an attitude, except the attitude is hip, not smug.The jokes - and the film - are amazingly funny, and a large part of this success should be credited to the characters, and to the talented actors who voice them.  By far, the best character in the film is Yzma's dimwitted henchman Kronk (voiced by Patrick Warburton), an affable thug who simply seems too stupid to be evil.  In his first few scenes, Kronk starts out as the typical Disney muscle-bound villain - thickheaded and prone to violence - but the villainy of Kronk slowly fades away as the film progresses, revealing a bizarrely hilarious character with Monty Python sensibilities. Kronk still dutifully follows the wicked Yzma's orders - to a point - but often performs such orders after setting his own priorities in order, such as baking spinach cheese balls or playing double dutch with kids.  It's loopy, but it works, and Kronk really is the lynchpin to this film's humor. John Goodman is also good as Pacha - he lends the film a certain amount of dignity, which is sorely needed, since the Emperor Kuzco isn't exactly a heroic figure.  He also gives the film a subtler layer of humor, as he quietly delivers some funny lines that can go unnoticed if you aren't paying strict attention to the film.  Eartha Kitt is absolutely delicious as the sorceress Yzma.  He plays her part as the ultimate spoiled diva; her character is a tightly wound emotional wreck, reacting to everything in such a sheer over-the-top fashion that it's pure comedy genius.  Ironically, the weakest character may be the Emperor himself - as Kuzco, David Spade and his acid wit are very funny at times, but the character remains abrasive for far too long.  He's almost too much to take at times, especially for kids - and face it; kids will be watching this film.  Toning Spade down a notch or two might have helped to smooth out the film and to make it better overall.Smart, hip, and daring to push the Disney envelope, `The Emperor's New Groove' is an outstanding film.  Adults will love it.  Kids might not get all the jokes, but they'll love it too - after all, `The Emperor's New Groove' is really just part of a zany cartoon tradition that kids have loved for a long, long time.  Just think of Bugs Bunny instead of Mickey Mouse as you put the tape in your VCR, and you and your family should be just fine. It's a very well done film.  Grade: A-",8,0,1,17 May 2001
The Matrix," Everything That 'Phantom Menace' Wanted To Be (may contain spoilers)
","'The Matrix', which owes its look and style to modern films ('Blade Runner', any Hong Kong martial arts movie starring Jet Li), actually tells a mythical story more reminiscent of the tales of Hercules, or of Robin Hood.  Despite its ingenious sci-fi trappings, at its core 'The Matrix' is a simple tale of good versus evil, David versus Goliath . . . and it introduces its audience to an unexplored, wondrous mythos of murky history.  In the process of telling its tale, 'The Matrix' hints at a richly plotted past that's never fully defined, but only hinted at with offhanded scraps of dialogue.  In this manner, it introduces a fictional world in many as breathtaking as the original 'Star Wars' did twenty-two years earlier -- but 'The Matrix' also tells a compelling story, unlike the more contemporary 'Phantom Menace'. The hero of 'The Matrix' is Neo (Keanu Reeves), who at first glance is just a geeky software programmer at a dull and boring company, looking to earn a paycheck just like everybody else. At home, though, in the small hours of the night, he's a computer hacker, and a good one.   His hacking activities draw the attention of two cyberpunk iconoclasts:  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), who exudes Zen-Master cool; and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), a leather-wearing femme fatale. Morpheus and Trinity reveal a profound truth about the world to the disbelieving Neo: the world doesn't exist. Everything that seems real is in fact a forced form of virtual reality, designed to make the people of the world blindly subservient to an alien-run 'system.' Morpheus and his group of cyber-rebels want to bring this system -- 'The Matrix' -- down, and firmly believe that Neo is the messiah-like 'One' who can lead his rebels to victory. The look of 'The Matrix' is absolutely fantastic.  Taking a page out of literary works like William Gibson's 'Mona Lisa Overdrive', the film blends film noir with 'dirty' high tech -- there's nothing bright and shiny in 'The Matrix'; nothing to suggest the happy future of 'The Jetsons'.  What's left is a gritty world where both intellect and imagination rule. From this world, directors Larry and Andy Wachowski create an epic comic-book conflict where the conflict between good and evil is blown up into slick, stylized, spectacular proportions.  The special effects, which includes CGI, traditional animation techniques, model work, and martial arts wire work, are all blended to make jaw-dropping action sequences . . . and to enhance the story.  (The opening scene with Trinity alone makes the film worth watching).  I don't know if anybody really knows what cyberspace will ultimately look like, but I hope when the time comes when people can immerse themselves in a world of virtual reality, it looks as cool as it does in 'The Matrix'.  The performances, for the most part, are perfect for the film.  Keanu Reeves doesn't exactly flex his acting chops as the impassive Neo, but the low-key approach seems appropriate for the role.  As Morpheus, Laurence Fishburne is sensational, making the character a perfect mix of a martial arts master, a cryptic philosopher, and a full-blown action hero.  Fishburne never raises his voice once during the film, but he has so much presence and confidence, he still comes across as the most commanding, authoritative character in the entire movie.  Hugo Weaving is also impressive as the main villain, Agent Smith, although by the end of the film he's glowered and barked exasperated orders so many times, it looks like he's watched Tommy Lee Jones in 'The Fugitive' once too often.  The biggest waste of a character, however, is Carrie-Anne Moss and Trinity, who still shines despite the criminal under-use of her character.  Trinity absolutely sets the incredible tone of 'The Matrix' in the opening scene, showing off her potential as possibly one of the greatest female action heroes in cinematic history . . . and then she's immediately relegated to supporting character status the instant Neo and Morpheus show up.  Memo to the Wachowski Brothers: Actually USE Trinity in the 'Matrix' sequels; it'd be nice to see her live up to what was hinted at in the first film.'The Matrix' presents a number of interesting concepts, ranging from the philosophical nature of existence itself to the pure adrenaline rush of combat in the cybernetic world.  (Although, it's slightly disappointing to see that despite all the brilliant originality of `The Matrix', wars are still apparently fought with mundane nine-millimeter handguns and AK-47s.) These concepts alone would make `The Matrix' a terrific movie, but they're presented with such panache, the film rockets into the realm of the all-time greats.  `The Matrix' is nearly everything one could hope for from a sci-fi blockbuster.

Gladiator," Very Entertaining, if Slightly Overrated, Epic
","`Gladiator' is a splendid, action-packed throwback to sandal epics such as `Spartacus'. Russell Crowe is Maximus, a general in the Roman army. After crushing an army of Gauls, Maximus meets with the Emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that he wishes Rome to become a Republic once more, after his death . . . and that he would like Maximus to help create this new Republic. Afterwards, Aurelius goes to see his spoiled son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), and tells him that he does not feel Rome should have another Emperor.  In a fit of rage, Commodus kills Aurelius and becomes emperor, and then promptly orders the execution of Maximus. Maximus manages to escape his own death . . . . but his wife and son, alas, do not.  Fast forward a few years (exactly how the following transpires is never clear), and Maximus is a slave, a gladiator forced to kill in order to entertain the Roman people.  As his popularity as a gladiator grows, Maximus begins to see how he can exact his vengeance upon Commodus.For the most part, `Gladiator' is well-acted. Russell Crowe is quietly intense as the former general Maximus, and manages to effortlessly pull off a memorable performance in what could've been a wooden role in other hands. Richard Harris is good as the wise and weary Marcus Aurelius, and the late Oliver Reed is excellent in his final role as Proximo, the cunning gladiator trainer.  The weak link of the cast is Joaquin Phoenix, who I still can't believe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his stiff, awkward portrayal of Commodus.  I found him annoying instead of terrifying  Commodus needed to be a fearful tyrant, and instead he was little more a petulant child.  This might have been more how the role was written instead of Joachim Phoenix's acting skill, but the character of Commodus still brought the movie down. Ridley Scott's direction is superb  the battle scenes and the gladiator fights are wonderfully done, and the movie has a grand, epic feel that's been missing from the big screen for far too long.  The use of CGI to recreate Rome is incredible as well.  Where the film falls apart to a certain extent is the story  there are a few plot holes that are just big enough to be distracting.  For example, the audience watching `Gladiator' in the theater or at home on their DVD player are given plenty of reasons to hate the vile Commodus . . . but it's never made clear why the Roman people would hate him.  The Emperor puts on lots of gladiator tournaments, gives out free bread, free wine  hey, the average Roman should love Commodus!  So why isn't he?  Little points like this drag `Gladiator' down slightly  and while these detractions certainly don't make `Gladiator' a bad film, I think they're enough to pull it down off the masterpiece mantel.  Personally, while I really liked `Gladiator', I think even nominating it for Best Picture of 2000 was a stretch, and as for actually winning the Best Picture Oscar . . . no.  It's good, but not that good.Still, an intense epic worth watching.  A-",8,0,0,17 April 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," A Wonderful Mess
","Yet again, the Coen Brothers have made a uniquely entertaining film. In 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?', three escaped convicts (George Clooney, Tim Blake Nelson, John Turturro) leave the chain gang in search of treasure and of home, encountering an 'odyssey' of strange adventures as they amble through the Depression-Era South. John Turturro Tim Blake Nelson do a wonderful job of playing affable dimwits, and Clooney puts in a top-notch performance as a flim-flam artist who's about as dumb as his two fellow escapees . . . he just knows more high-falutin' words that make him sound smart.  The other cast members are equally impressive -- Charles Durning, John Goodman, and Michael Badaluco all put in some stunning performances as well.Like most Joel and Ethan Coen movies, the story is both bizarre and highly entertaining, with some memorable one-liners punctuating some equally memorable scenes.  ('We're in a tight spot!') Where the movie falls short of some of their other efforts is the overall plot -- 'O Brother' is more a mishmash of loosely related scenes than an actual story; as such, it sometimes drags or otherwise fails to grab your attention. Still, all in all, quite good -- and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the Delta bluegrass soundtrack, which adds a healthy amount of texture and depth to the laid-back charming fun that is 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'
