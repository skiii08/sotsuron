The Hangover," Piece of Crap
","This piece of crap. The writers and actors should be shot. Homophobic humor condones and incites anti-gay violence. If anti-Black slurs had been used in this movie the way anti-gay slurs were, this movie would NEVER have been released. It's THIS kind of anti-gay 'culture' that leads to gay teen SUICIDES. It's NOT funny, It's NOT OK. If I ever meet the writers or the cast in person, I swear I will punch them in the face. They deserve to be shot. Let them say all the other slurs, too. Got one for Jews? I do. Got one for Italians? There's one of those, too. How about women? Koreans? Japanese? Indians? Developmentally Disabled? SLURS KILL. And if there is any justice, all the assholes connected with this movie will get theirs, too.",1,7,15,16 May 2011
