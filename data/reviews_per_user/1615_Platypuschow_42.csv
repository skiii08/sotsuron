Your Name.," Your Name: Not as good as it should have been
","I'm a fan of studio Ghibli, I believe the likes of The Red Turtle (2016) and Grave Of The Fireflies (1988) are masterpieces so I like giving these types of similar animation a chance even if they aren't made by the same people.Your Name heavily reminds me of Ghiblis work, it has that beautiful animation style and emotion driven storyline.It tells the story of two high school students, one in Tokyo and one in a small village outside of the city whose lives are bizarrely connected. The movie successfully twists, turns and fascinates but when the credits rolled I found myself a tad underwhelmed.The concept, the animation, the beautiful soundtrack, it all promises more than it delivers.Your Name is by no means a bad film, it just flounders and doesn't seem to come close to its potential. It is beautiful, it is sweet and its some heartfelt stuff but the emotional tour de force I was expecting? Hardly.At time of writing its the 83rd highest rated movie on IMDb and won 10 of the 11 awards it was nominated for. Consider me somewhat surprised on both fronts.A sweet little animated tale all the same ideal for people who enjoy studio Ghibli's work due to the similarities.The Good: Sweet opening credits Great soundtrack Very likable The Bad:Underwhelming Should have been better Things I Learnt From This Movie:When you find yourself singing along to a song in a language you don't speak nor understand you may have a problem",6,15,23,29 October 2017
The Expendables 2," The Expendables 2: I'm just not the demographic
","To me The Expendables franchise is a pretencious vanity project.Yeah sure I get it, all the most famous action stars thrown together for old school action. I understand the appeal, I just don't like it.Now despite what my profiles analytics say I don't really like action movies, they're not my thing unless they have a lot of other themed content (Action/horror etc). Sure I respect the old school original action films, they had a certain novelty charm to them but here it comes across as recycled as much as it does a homage.Considering the list of famous names the action isn't as explosive as you'd imagine and the fight scenes are really quite lame. How can you have Stallone/Arnie/Willis and not have the best action? How can you have Van Damme/Norris/Jet Li and not have great fight scenes? It's like they decided they didn't need to make the effort because they had the cast, well you did.The Expendables 2 is on par with the first movie, namely brainless action with a generic cliched storyline and nothing even remotely original.It's like they took all these stars, threw them into a paint by numbers action flick and assumed it would work. Oh wait, it did. The franchise has been very successful. I'm sure it's nostalgic for the old and new and exciting for the young.Well it doesn't appeal to me. Call me weird but I want more than gun fights, explosions and fist fights. I want story, I want substance, I want originality.The Good:Old school actionFew neat action movie referencesThe Bad:Statham still can't act for crapSome of the cgi is ropey, really shouldn't have been any anywayMindlessThings I Learnt From This Movie:Charisma Carpenter is improving with ageReal heroes open fire with high impact automatic weapons even when innocents are in the same direction",3,4,5,22 May 2018
It," It: Not as bad as I expected, not as good as they say
","Remakes/reboots are a plenty at the moment and I'm 'That' guy who gets angry whenever a new one is announced and It was no exception so naturally I went in expecting the worst.Some remakes are direct scene for scene while others take the concept but go into business for themselves. It does a combination and for the most part it works.With a solid Stand By Me (1986) vibe and turning the tale into a two parter we see the Losers club battle Pennywise The Clown and it turned over a nice profit at the box office and was met with critical acclaim. I as expected do not understand the hype and am certainly not onboard but even I can't dispute that there are some real successes here.It looks great, its well written and the young cast do a brilliant job. As for Bill SkarsgÃ¥rd I have to say, meh. It's not that he did a bad job, he's just performing in the shadow of someone better.I'm a Stephen King fanboy at heart and I love both his works and most of the movie adaptations so I'm happy to see that this isn't a black mark on his record but do not want to see anymore remade.Credit where credit is due, this is a well made feature but flawed in places and simply shouldn't have been made in the first place.The Good: Looks greatThe Bad:Yet another unneeded remakeSome weak momentsThings I Learnt From This Movie:The Jewish cap also makes a great frisbeeThe writers took floating too literallyClearly the rumours were correct, two boys in one film! For shame! #sarcasm",7,16,26,17 December 2017
Hereditary," Hereditary: Peculiar little film
","I wasn't expecting much from Hereditary, Hollywood has lost their way when it comes to horror to such an extent I'm not sure I've enjoyed one since Orphan (2009). Starring Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne it's an odd little tale and very hard to explain without spoiling anything.It's certainly interesting, has some genuine shocks and is in no way predictible like these things usually are but alas it does still fall into many of the usual Hollywood pitfalls.A highly over convoluted plot that does leave you scratching your head, I'm happy to say it does for the most part explain everything it just goes around the houses in doing so.Performances are on point, visually it looks solid and again it's not the cliched mess you expect to come out of Hollywood, but it's still not all that good.I cannot get my head around how it has such an incredibly high rating. 7.4 at time of writing, a movie only needs 8.0 to get into the top 250 movies! I assume that will drop in time, but don't understand the appeal.As always I believe if you want horror, go independent. Hollywood may have surprised me with this, but barely entertained.The Good:UnpredictibleHas some genuinely shocking momentsThe Bad:Still cliched to hellPlot is a bit of a messThings I Learnt From This Movie:Too many characters got ahead of themselves",4,15,27,14 September 2018
Train to Busan," Train to Busan: A contender for the greatest zombie movie ever made
","There are rare events in our world, solar eclipses, tsunami's, the UK chart having a decent song at no.1. Another is me giving a film 10/10, it simply doesn't happen.Me and Korean cinema have always had a good relationship, I tend to enjoy their works and this right here is their coup de grace.Essentially a sequel to Seoul Station (2016) which was an acclaimed feature length zombie anime, Train To Busan tells the story of the passengers of a train from Seoul to Busan as the outbreak begins.Full of fantastic characters, great writing and several scenes that need to be seen to be believed Train To Busan shows how fresh the zombie sub genre can be in the right hands.The film looks incredible and flows perfectly all the way from the first victim to the incredible memorable finale.Train To Busan is nothing short of a masterpiece that I would recommend to everyone not just fans of the genre.I would love to see a sequel as this was near perfection.The Good:Brilliant characters/character developmentLooks outstandingHighly originalAction packedEmotionally charged and thought provokingThe Bad:Can't think of a thing",10,20,43,24 October 2017
Passengers," Passengers: The Beautiful People Movie
","I was highly skeptical of Passengers, though I liked the concept I simply couldn't see past the studio literally picking the two 'Hottest' young current stars as the leads. It all seemed so forced, right down to their criminally photoshopped cover images.Not anything against them, they are a talented pair. But their chemistry wasn't there and that's something you'd think would be a problem with the creators not something to be ignored for the purpose of ratings. I mean they did have a $110 million budget to make back.Heavily promoted, this is one I couldn't avoid if I wanted to so I eventually took the dive and found myself torn with the results.First off as you'd expect for a movie of that budget it all looks great, polished to near perfection the film is a visual treat no doubt.Trouble is the movie is your standard Hollywood formula, predictable, clichéd & shiny. Though the premise is solid, the creators clearly didn't know how to fully utilize this so the movie fell short.Top that off with me thinking Pratt should stick to comedy and being poorly cast here and the movie was littered with flaws.But again it's big and it's shiny and Lawrence looks beautiful as always so it's very easy to be distracted by the fact that the movie isn't actually very good. The ending I found questionable but overall this could have been a complete garbage fire, yet avoided this and resulted in a watchable effort if you can get through the overbearing Hollywood tropes.",6,5,7,14 March 2017
Us," Us: The concept saves it
","I enjoyed Get Out (2017) but I wasn't aboard the hype train, it was good but I didn't understand why people ranted and raved about it being incredible.Upon seeing the trailer for Us I was excited, I loved this idea it looked positively chilling. As always however I assumed the worst, I've long since learned to keep my expectations low when it comes to Hollywood films.Well, I class Us in the same category as Get Out, namely it's good but it's hardly anything special.It tells the story of a family who come under attack by their own clones. The concept works and the film turned out to be miles above the home invasion film I expected it to be. In fact the scale is far greater than I assumed, this was really quite good.The cast do a great job, but for a movie that tries to come across genuinely scary and chilling there was a lot of comedy thrown in and I'm not sure that was a great idea.The story is decent, it's well paced and it all comes together in the end. However something didn't feel quite right, something I can't quite put my finger on but whatever it was kept the movie from being anything beyond enjoyable.Peele has delivered another enjoyable film, but don't believe the hype.The Good:Great ideaFitting soundtrackThe Bad:A couple of plot holesInconsistent tone",7,5,10,27 May 2019
Aquaman," Aquaman: Basically what I expected, and that's not a good thing
","Where could I even start?Let it be known immediately I'm unimpressed with the DC cinematic universe thus far, though not bad I've considered the movies very underwhelming for the most part. I think they dropped the ball thoroughly and rushed to make Justice League (2017) without debuting most of the characters first like Marvel did.Now Aquaman is a delicate one, because let's be honest he's hard to take seriously. He was silly in Smallville (2001), he was silly in his own cartoon, all the animated outings and the live action television series never even got past the pilot. It's a dude who talks to fish and once taken away from water doesn't really have a gimmick. For this reason (And many more) I was skeptical of the DCU version and with good reason, sure he was fairly neat in Justice League but here? Really?You see straight off the bat I'll say I like Momoa I'd consider myself a fan, he's a competent actor with a unique look. But he's not Arthur Curry! Aquaman is the blonde haired jock looking character, not long black haired bearded Samoan looking fella! So as much as I like the actor, I struggle to see him as this character who has been around since 1941 and has always had the same look which they've not embraced.So getting over that what do we have? Over 2hrs of CGI laden silliness featuring our beloved fishman, Atlantis, tridents, oceanic life fighting for him and goofy looking villains. In fact it's so CGI-laden and so colorful it may as well have been animated because it practically is anyway.The story is very Hollywood, very by the numbers stuff so no surprise there. The cast is decent enough but people like Dafoe just look so out of place because they're too good for this.I'd like to say this is take your brain out fun but it's not, Suicide Squad (2016) was take your brain out fun this right here is get yourself a full frontal lobotomy mediocrity.It's cheesy, it's tacky, it's over the top, it lacks the laughs that could have saved it (To an extent) and it's done nothing to redeem the DC universe in my eyes especially considering I'd count this as their worst movie yet.Aquaman is one of those critically acclaimed movies that I'll never understand why and can only assume it's fans are (Mostly) made up of children and ladies lusting after Momoa.The Good:Momoa is the personification of 'Cool'A few funny momentsSome very impressive visualsThe Bad:That simply isn't Arthur CurryHard to take any of it seriouslyTacky Hollywood nonsense",3,8,12,30 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Deadpool 2: Worthy sequel
","I loved Deadpool (2016) I was blown away by it and Reynolds commitment to the character, it was fantastic.I was however heartbroken when I saw the first trailer for this sequel, it looked pants. Not just pants, I mean granny pants. 15yr old, torn, badly stained (4 different shades) granny pants.I've never been so happy about being wrong. Deadpool 2 delivers and is easily comparable in quality to the first movie and I sure as hell did not expect that.With fantastic new additions, all the returning cast and excellent cameos this is the Deadpool sequel I desired but didn't expect (Or possibly deserve).With it's brand of over the top violence, quick fire humour, endless pop culture references and Reynolds in the role he was born to play Deadpool 2 is a worthy sequel in a franchise that I don't ever want to end if it continues like this.So damn funny, I can't wait to see what they do with the third movie. The concept however of bringing Deadpool into the existing Marvel Universe though fills me with dread. How could Deadpools brand of R rated goodness possibly fit into the Disney universe? Don't........do it!The Good:Cast are fantastic againSo damn funnyAction packedSoundtrack as random as it may beThe incredible during credits scenesThe Bad:That kid, he's just beyond annoying in everything he's inSome questionable casting choices for the new charactersThings I Learnt From This Movie:Everyday should be international womans dayVinnie Jones is all grown up",9,64,96,22 August 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Thor Ragnarok: Marvel deliver yet again
","I admit it, I'm not exactly a Thor fan. I think the first two Thor feature films were passable efforts but paled in comparison to other heroes outings. For this reason I went in expecting a whole lot of meh!Now Ragnarok was critically acclaimed, I never heard a bad thing about it despite the fact that I wasn't blown away by the trailer at all.So with a new Thor outing, sprinkles of Planet Hulk and more humour than usual (Especially from Thor) how'd I think it did?From the opening moments with Thor swinging from a chain awkwardly rotating as he's trying to have a conversation I was gripped. This wasn't the dull boring stoic Thor we'd grown to accept, this guy was cracking of the wise and I was laughing by buttocks off.Cate Blanchett delivers as Hela like I never expected she'd manage, Jeff Goldblum is excellent in a role he felt almost born for and the entire thing is one joke filled roller coaster ride that I enjoyed considerably more than I expected to.Did all the comedy diminish the impact of the Marvel Universe? Oddly not, it fit in perfectly even when a serious moment was underlined with a goofy slapstick laugh.Kudos to Marvel once again, so far out of every single MCU movie I've only disliked 2 and for a harsh critic like me that's really something.So much fun, so many laughs and has freshened up a character that in this guys opinion was getting a bit stale. Damn good job.The Good:Cast do a great jobGenuinely funny stuffThe Bad:Could have done more with the Planet Hulk story arcThings I Learnt From This Movie:This is where Hulk and Thor were during Civil War!!!!Immigrant Song just makes any scene betterIt's probably best Jaimie Alexander (Lady Sif) couldn't be part of the filmHulk talking is weird, confusing and please make it stop",8,15,23,16 May 2018
Ready Player One," Ready Player One: Considerably better than I expected
","There seem to be two camps as far as Ready Player One is concerned, those who have read the books (Who tend to dislike the movie) and those who haven't (Who tend to like the movie). I'm in the latter group and am very thankful for this.When the trailer came out I was unimpressed and didn't get onboard with the hype at all, yes I was impressed with all the pop culture references and characters but I figured it would be all flash and no substance.Thankfully I couldn't have been anymore wrong, Read Player One has plenty of substance, emotion and charm and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it.Set in a near dystopian world where people use a virtual reality world called the Oasis to escape their lives it tells the story of one player and his efforts participating in a competition that with decide the fate of the entire universe (Oasis).The plot if fantastic and very well handled, the movie looks like a billion dollars, the cast did a decent enough job and the pop culture references though thick and fast didn't overwhelm the movie like I feared they would.From Overwatchs Tracer, Streetfighters Chun-Li & Ryu, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Iron Giant, Chucky, Freddy Kreuger, Mortal Kombats Goro, Gundam, Mech-Godzilla, King Kong, and countless more I being a big ol'nerd really appreciated this. Combined with the incredible mostly 80's soundtrack it's a sight to behold.The movie wrapped up nicely and went in directions I didn't expect, I'm suitably impressed and would love to see more.If it's very different than the book I understand peoples anger, for me however this was fantastic.The Good:Looks amazingSolid plot and deliveryPop culture references are charmingThe Bad:Honestly nothing springs to mindThings I Learnt From This Movie:I'm still not impressed with GundamPeople CAN swear in Spielberg moviesOld Simon Pegg looks like a tall hobbitArtemis is the offspring of an elf and a porcupine",9,93,141,5 September 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Spider-Man Homecoming: Best Spiderman film? Absolutely
","I've never been a Spiderman guy, I haven't exactly enjoyed any of his previous incarnations and was highly fearful that his addition to Civil War & the Marvel Universe would damage it.In Civil War he was a perfect fit, he was entertaining enough to be memorable but had a role small enough to just be an introduction and not shadowing the existing heroes.Here in Tom Hollands first solo outing as the web slinger I was unsure what to expect, but one thing for certain is I didn't expect it to be this good.A solid addition the existing universe, extremely likable funny and action packed this was a perfectly paced movie and I'm so glad they did this and not yet another origin story.The cast is on point, the delivery outstanding and I think this stands besides the first Avengers film as the best of the franchise thus far.I'm so glad to see new life breathed into the character and very much look forward to seeing what comes next for the webhead.Truly good stuff, exceeding every expectation I had and then a few more for good measure.The Good: Holland and Keaton are excellent Very likable Genuinely funny The Bad: Flash Thompson casting Bad attempt at Shocker Vulture simply isn't Vulture Things I Learnt From This Movie: Disney has realised its 2017 and swear words aren't going to tarnish their image",9,48,81,20 October 2017
Bird Box," Bird Box: Expected gem of a movie
","Bird Box was an unknown entity to me, one of those films from Netflix I just slapped on to end the evening. Little did I know it would wind up being the best movie I've seen in months.Remember The Happening (2008)? Well it's like that, except it actually has a great story, competent cast, great cinematography and incredible payoff. Okay scratch that it's nothing like The Happening.It tells the story of a pregnant woman trying to survive during a global incident which is causing people to show erratic, psychotic and suicidal behavior.It's a fantastically crafted little horror starring Sandra Bullock and John Malkovich, two veterans who aren't exactly known for that genre. Regardless they knock it out of the park with incredible performances (But with Malkovich that's the only kind of performance he does).The story is a tour de force with multiple emotional and psychological levels when you stop and really think about what you're watching. Deep, meaningful, well written and looks amazing. The presence of two children couldn't even damage it for me!Bird Box is a wondrous film and would recommend it to all. It does mostly follow the Hollywood formula, but it does it in a respectful manner as to not patronize the viewer as most do.Excellent stuff.The Good:Great storyVery well constructedStrong performancesLooks the partThe Bad:Nothing springs to mindThings I Learnt From This Movie:There is hope for modern cinema yetNames are overratedSarah Paulson is Merlyn Temple, that's all I can seeA sequel is ABSOLUTELY not necessary, yet a guilty part of me would like to see one",9,66,113,23 December 2018
Justice League," Justice League: Too little, too soon
","So DC holds the two biggest superheroes in the World (Superman/Batman) so why are they getting so thoroughly dismantled by Marvel? Why is their universe simply not working?I think there are a number of reasons but the primary one is that they are using a failing formula. Look at Marvel, they established each character with their own movie(s), they did a slow build in creating their universe and introduced the characters to one another over time.DC however didn't, they did a couple of Superman movies, Wonder Woman, the messy Batman vs Superman and the barely connected to the DC Universe (At that time) Suicide Squad. And then like that boom Justice League without establishing Aquaman, Cyborg or Flash. I'm rooting for DC don't get me wrong but at this stage it'll take something special to turn things around. Batman vs Superman should have been one of the biggest movies of all time yet fell flat and Justice League suffers from the same ills.A massive cgi-fest that feels rushed and forced, an Aquaman who is no doubt badass but simply isn't Arthur Curry, a villian so dull he at no point felt like a threat and a generic army of henchmen.Justice League was supposed to be DC's crown jewel but is just another further demonstration that they have absolutely no idea what they're doing.The Good:Performances are solid for a movie of this genreThe Bad:Aquaman is poorly castAll feels rushedAction scenes are hit and missTerrible antagonistHenry Cavill is just awfulThings I Learnt From This Movie:Aquaman is going to be dreadfulDC is not and will never be able to compete with Marvel",5,9,15,5 May 2018
Split," Split: I don't get it.....
","I wasn't going to watch Split, I only changed my mind upon learning it was connected to Unbreakable and I'd really need to watch it before Glass (2019) is released. Watching the trailer it just didn't look like something that would appeal to me and I'm far from being a fan of Shyamalan.Critically acclaimed it tells the story of......you know what, I'll skip that part as it's become so famous everyone already knows.Starring James McAvoy in yet another great performance and Anya Taylor-Joy a very promising young actress who already has a very impressive resume I walked away from Split happier than I expected but still not impressed.Have you ever finished a movie, scratched your head and simply questioned what the point of it all was? Like it was somehow incomplete and without the missing elements there just didn't seem to be any point to its existence? Well that's how I felt here, it was full of great performances and a couple of neat ideas but little else.I walked away intrigued but unsatisfied. I very much hope Glass pulls it altogether.The Good:Interesting conceptStrong performancesThe Bad:Feels incompleteDoesn't even remotely live up to the hype",5,8,14,15 January 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Spider-Man Into the Spider-Verse: And with that the Oscars lose the last bit of credibility they had
","Where could I even dream to begin on this one? An animated Spiderman film that sits at time of writing as the 41st highest rated movie on IMDB and won an Oscar? Who'd have thought such a thing was possible?So the movie has been hyped left, right, center and diagonally, I've literally not heard one single bad thing about it but the facts mentioned above left me stunned! What could this possibly be to be heralded in such a way?Telling the story of a young man who is also bitten by a radioactive spider and develops superpowers. Kingpins latest dastardly scheme is tearing the fabrics of reality apart and alternate universe versions of Spiderman have all ended up in the same universe. I'm sure you can work out what happens next.So the animation style is a tweak on Pixar, it plays out like a comic book and call me weird but that certainly didn't work for me. The animation doesn't flow fluidly, it looks hokey, disjointed and I found myself frustrated by it.The plot is a novel concept and I liked it, the delivery however I did not. Certain aspects make very little sense, sure it's a Spiderman film so I'm not supposed to think about it too much but I did and my conclusions were migraine inducing stupidity. Did I say stupidity? Oh the stupid doesn't end there sadly, I get the multiverse concept of anything is possible but their Spiderman variant choices were bafflingly dumb and what you'd expect from a Saturday morning cartoon not a blockbuster film!It tries to be heartfelt, but comes across half-assed.
It tries to be funny, but comes across childish.
It tries to be action packed but the style of animation didn't allow it to be done justice.Okay I'm slating the film right now so it probably sounds like I hated it, which I didn't. 6/10 is a fair rating and suggests its above average and it is. But I'm annoyed at the acclaim that's it's been bathed in.8.6 rating on IMDB are you kidding me? And the Oscars have lacked credibility in my eyes for years because of their ridiculous bias and genre-snubbing but this right here is the last bit of credibility up in smoke. I'm not saying a superhero movie shouldn't be Oscar worthy, but this silly cartoon simply isn't (And neither is Black Panther but I'll resist the urge to rant).Into the Spider-Verse to me is no different than all the straight to DVD Marvel and DC efforts we see a couple of each year. The only difference here is the animation style, nothing else sets it apart.I just don't get the appeal.The Good:Some great writingGreat ideaThe Bad:Animation hardly flowsUnexpectedly sillyPlot holes that are unforgivably stupid",6,28,51,22 March 2019
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man: Unnecessary but bareable
","I was deeply unhappy when I heard about the filming of The Amazing Spider-Man, I believe in original ideas and with something as broad as Spiderman at least giving it a decent length of time before 'Rebooting'.It was too soon, the quality of the McGuire trilogy is irrelevant it was simply too soon to be starting again. Yet another origin story, another introduction to Gwen, another uncle Ben death scene and another villian.Andrew Garfield is dull, he simply didn't cut it as Spiderman and I consider Emma Stone to be one of the most overrated actresses in Hollywood so the newly reborn franchise wasn't off to a great start in my eyes.So at over two hours at least they gave the movie a chance to shine, alas it doesn't though it's not the complete train wreck I expected.In this outing (And origin) Parker takes on The Lizard played by the always excellent Rhys Ifans who is simply too good for this movie.It has its moments but for $230 million it damn well should have had considerably more.The Good:Crane scene was greatLizard looked decentDennis Leary & Rhys IfansThe Bad:I really don't like Andrew GarfieldWeak soundtrackWas simply too soon after the last 'Reboot'Things I Learnt From This Movie:Some Lizards can grow limbs back at will...........at will!?Along with super powers spider bites also provide personalities",6,3,4,5 February 2018
The Lego Movie," The LEGO Movie: A surprising accomplishment
","I went into The Lego Movie expecting drivel, I thought it'd be alike the DC ones but without the DC element to appease me. Thankfully I was wrong, way wrong.This HUGELY acclaimed multi award winning Oscar nominated feature length animated lego movie is an entertaining roller coaster ride for all ages.With a vast cast of overpaid Hollywood stars led by Chris Pratt we see original Lego characters team with the likes of Batman, Gandalf, Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and more to foil an evil plot.The first thing that struck me is how good it all looks, considerably better than every other Lego movie I've seen from the flow of the animation to the stunning lighting effects.Okay it is pretty dumb, but it's dumb fun and thats okay by me.Silly but with enough to keep parents entertained this is a roaring accomplishment. I'm not sure I'd consider it Oscar-worthy, but then again most Oscar winners I don't consider deserving.The Lego Movie is a lot of fun and has reaffirmed my faith in them.The Good:Looks incredibleLot of funThe Bad:Still pretty silly in placesMore than a slight sprinkle of Hollywood excess and stupidityThings I Learnt From This Movie:The double decker couch actually sounds quite neatWiping your bum with a hook for a hand is really hardIt's not expected for a person to marry a marshmallow",7,8,9,20 January 2018
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," The Hobbit The Desolation of Smaug: Alike the first, impressive but not ground breaking
","The Lord Of The Rings trilogy blew me away, they were truly outstanding masterpieces that deserved every bit of recognition they got.The Hobbit I delayed due to a laundry list of concerns, all of which are being confirmed now I'm finally getting around to them.They look beautiful, they are a lot of fun, but compared to LOTR they are alike Mythica movies.The whole franchise has become a cash grab, the Hobbit should have been one single movie and without all the excessive alterations. Yes I know LOTR had changes, but not to this devastating extent.Desolation Of Smaug certainly has it's moments, I especially enjoyed the spiders and the not so jolly romp through the cursed forest. Thankfully the film isn't as goofy as the first either which was a welcome relief.Alas it's no better, it still feels lackluster. This is The Hobbit, one of the greatest tales ever put to paper! So why do these movies feel so underwhelming? I enjoyed this I truly did, but not as much as I should have and that right there is the problem.The Good: Forest scene was great Looks stunning The Bad: As neat as the barrels scene is it's about as realistic as Tara Reeds boobs Second movie, second stock scream Things I Learnt From This Movie: Bilbo Baggins has never seen Arachnophobia (1990), don't.....pluck.....the web Walnuts make great pillowsWhatever Cumberbatch was paid it was FAR too much",7,17,21,30 November 2017
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," The Hobbit An Unexpected Journey: Like Lord Of The Rings, if Lord Of The Rings was written by grade schoolers
","Now don't get me wrong from the summary, I did enjoy The Hobbit. I enjoyed it in fact more than I expected to especially since I delayed watching them because of certain fears and frustrations I had regarding it.The Hobbit was the very first book I read back in the mid 80's and I adored it. I simply couldn't figure out how it could be turned into a trilogy! I feared it was being done so to milk the franchise and let's be honest that's exactly why it was done.The Hobbit has most of the charm of LOTR and all of its beauty. Top that off with a stellar cast and it was destined to do well at the box office (Which it did) However something was different, something was.....off.Though the film contains the same level of violence as LOTR its overflowing with comedy and goofiness. I expected some, but not to this extent. At one point it felt like I was watching Labyrinth (1986) again, not like that's a bad thing but I didn't expect it here.It looks great, its scored near perfectly and as mentioned the cast do a great performance and it was nice to see the likes of James Nesbitt and Sylvester McCoy up on the big screen.Inevitably there was going to be comparison with LOTR, that was inescapable and the comparison just doesn't help it at all. It pales in comparison and with all the silliness I found myself underwhelmed.The Hobbit is a passable effort but is more like the Mythica series than Lord Of The Rings.The Good: Beautiful Excellent score Brilliant cast The Bad: Some parts go beyond comedic into the realms of silly Martin Freeman just isn't leading man material Goblin town song, really? Stock scream was totally unnecessary Things I Learnt From This Movie: Someone should never use the term 'Mothers glory box' again The distance Bilbo's sword needs to detect orcs/goblins changes between scenes, any particular reason?",7,23,32,29 November 2017
Before Sunset," Before Sunset: Still don't see the appeal
","The first of two critically acclaimed sequels to the critically acclaimed Before Sunsrise (1995) see's us catching up with Jesse & Celine 9yrs later.I found the first to be a dull, slow, 'Talkie' film with little appeal and claim the same here. I simply do not see the attraction at all.Hawke is unlikeable again, Delpy is devoid of the charm she had in the first and the whole film feels like a desperate attempt to cash in on the popularity of the first with yet another ambiguous finale.I like the idea of the simplicity behind both films, I guess I just didn't appreciate the lines of conversation or the way they ended them both.I believe the films would have been a lot more appealing if they'd both shut the hell up, strapped a go-pro camera on and just given us 90 minutes of of the wonderful country and it's architecture.",3,7,12,18 July 2017

","Let me be clear Infinity War is not flawless, it has its faults but thankfully they are overshadowed by two hours of awesomeness.Every movie in the Marvel universe for the last decade has ultimately been building up to this therefore expectations were through the roof and for the most part it delivers.Almost every character from the MCU teams up to face its most dangerous foe yet, the mad titan himself Thanos and if you know anything about the comics then going in you'd know to brace yourself for heartache.With all the hype as to who wouldn't survive the film I'm left wondering just how many deaths are permanent, this is a superhero universe after all so never say never.Though the story and Thanos's motivations differ from the comic this can be forgiven as the new story is wafer thin but competent.As you can imagine one of the most exciting things about Infinity War was uniting heroes we've never seen side by side and that certainly delivers on all fronts. The action is thick and fast, despite the dark overtone we have plenty of comedy and teenage Groot didn't ruin the film like I feared he would.Obviously this is not a big finale and merely a high profile chapter in a much larger story but the movie is highly climatic regardless.I am saddened that this wasn't a two parter, alike Civil War (2016) this was a huge story and perhaps should have been broken up across movies.Infinity War is a contender for the best Marvel movie and instead of feeling burnt out after the never ending stream of films this has wet my appetite for more and I can't wait for the next film.Excellent stuff, though where in the blue hell was Ant Man?The Good:Children of ThanosThanosAll out action as expectedTies everything together nicelyThe Bad:Peter Dinklage (Never thought I'd say that)So many characters were spread too thinThings I Learnt From This Movie:If Thanos and Cable ever meet its going to be super weirdDishonest footage/photos are commonplace now (Look up the footage of Hulk in Wakanda running with the rest of the team) Seriously, never happened.Somewhere out there right now are DC fans claiming this is a bad film",9,61,119,4 May 2018
Stardust," Stardust: Passable but thats about it
","Written by Jane Goldman and with a plethora of established stars such as Claire Danes, Robert DeNiro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ricky Gervais & Mark Strong this UK/US made film is quite nostalgic.What I mean by that is its a fantasy tale that reminds me a great deal of many from the 80's/90's. From Willow to Ladyhawke this has that vibe to it and is a very charming film.Family aimed though dark in places it tells a highly convoluted story that manages to entertain but certainly doesn't meet its potential.Magic, sword fights, flying pirate ships, ghosts, betrayal and love. Everything you could possibly expect from such a movie.The comedy is lacking but the cheesiness is overflowing, thankfully the great cast make the most of it and it comes out the other side watchable.Maybe I'm not the demographic, but this mega budget effort felt like it should have been a grand epic but wound up like a feature length pilot for a television series.I commend Danes on her performance, this is an actress I usually don't see the appeal of but she was excellent here. The rest of the cast including a huge variety of British comedians also do a great job, but I expected more.The Good:Danes & DeNiroSweet taleThe Bad:Lackluster in placesI'm supposed to root for a kidnapper?Take That for the credits, really!Few annoying unanswered questionsThings I Learnt From This Movie:Blueblood is meant literallyRobert DeNiro in a dress is a memory that takes gallons of alcohol to eraseMark Strong looks weird with hair",6,6,11,4 February 2018
A Quiet Place," A Quiet Place: As good as they say
","A Quiet Place was critically acclaimed and for some reason that tends to mean I won't like it. No idea why I just don't tend to follow the unwashed masses when it comes to movies, I am however mistaken sometimes.Starring real life married couple Emily Blunt and John Krasinski, also directed by the latter this highly original horror got my attention from the get go and held it throughout.It tells the story of a post apocalyptic world that has been torn apart by mysterious creatures that find their prey exclusively through sound. It follows one family as they try to survive in absolute silence.The fact there is such little dialogue or really any form of audio is how A Quiet Place finds its identity. I'm not saying it hasn't been done before but it hasn't on quite this scale and it works considerably better than you'd imagine.The cast are great, the cinematography is fantastic and the story is really well put together. To add to this I think A Quiet Place is genuinely one of the most tension filled movies I've ever seen, I squinted, I cringed, I clenched my fist, on sat on the edge of my seat multiple times throughout.A Quiet Place deserves the critical acclaim, though it's not perfect it is however an absolute triumph and a real spectacle. Certainly one of those 'Movies to see before you die' types.If you haven't seen it yet, do something about that.The Good:Very engrossingWell actedHighly originalSo incredibly tense in placesThe Bad:Just a couple of poorly thought out momentsThings I Learnt From This Movie:Kids are a liabilityKids shouldn't be trusted with anything everKids suck",8,136,228,12 November 2018
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," The Amazing Spider-Man 2: Not so amazing
","I didn't enjoy the first Amazing Spiderman and went into it doubting I would, I was frustrated that the franchise had been rebooted so soon but it was a passable effort.Because of this my hopes for the second part were higher and they certainly weren't met with anything favorable.Spiderman returns and this time he's battling an unrecognizable Electro and later an even less unrecognizable Rhino, oh and a pants looking Green Goblin.Because these movies made less than the Sam Raimi movies it was decided to pull the plug and no third part was set to be made. Which is a shame considering certain things teased at the end of the film but will never happen now.Again Garfield doesn't shine in the titular role, in fact few people do. This sequel is uninspired, hollywood cliche filled and quite frankly boring.The Good:Colm Feore & Dane DeHaanThe Bad:The changes to the villians are far too severePoor soundtrack againThings I Learnt From This Movie:Paul Giamatti should adopt his characters look on the inside so that his appearance is as ugly as his personalityMost superheroes also have the power of recklessly endangering the publicLittle known fact, the Christian god's real name is Sparkles therefore Electro couldn't have called himself that in fear of getting sued",4,7,10,6 February 2018
Garden State," Garden State: Zach Braff fluff piece part 2
","Zach 'Millionaire who crowdfunds to get his fans to pay for projects to make himself richer' Braff writes, directs and stars in this indie fluff piece. You know the indie movie type, the ones that look pretty but have absolutely no point or substance whatsoever.This particular one is full of unlikeable characters, generic clichés & practically no entertainment value at all.Yes I thoroughly have a bee in my bonnet regarding millionaires asking the unwashed masses for money but that isn't why I think this is poor! I think this is poor because *Drum Roll* it's pretty darn poor.I do not understand how this is a critically acclaimed multi award winning effort. By the end of the film I was exhausted, bored to tears and wishing I could merge Garden State with Friday The 13th and watch Jason go to town on the lot of them with a bladed instrument of his choosing!",3,3,6,4 August 2017
The Big Blue," Le grand bleu: I really don't know what to make of that
","At it's peak The Big Blue reached the 96th highest rated movie on IMDb, and that is no small feat. Learning this I was further astounded that I hadn't already seen it.French made by internationally renound director Luc Besson both as writer and director the Big Blue is a curious film that left me scratching my head yet oddly entertained.It tells the story of two friends since childhood with a passion for competetive deep sea diving. One is the world champion, arrogant and relatively famous while the other is more reclusive, mysterious and with a certain innocence.The two men compete against each other, constantly trying to one up the other while maintaining a loyalty and friendship. When a New York reporter begins to fall for one of the pair a story of love and friendship truly begins.Here is the trouble though, the friendship was questionable and the love felt hugely one sided. One character was conceited while the other ignorant and though gripped I struggled to care about the characters quite as much as I should have.The plot though competent is wafer thin, the love story flawed and considering this film is almost 3hrs long I felt it was remarkably shallow.On the flipside however the cast delivered on every front, the writing was wonderful the score was hugely fitting and the cinematography was absolutely second to none. The whole movie is perfectly crafted and has some of the most incredible visuals I've ever seen!Despite all it's glaring flaws and my inability to see this magical love story it is still a sight to behold and a triumph for Besson.The Good:Some stunning visualsVery charmingWell scoredGreat castThe Bad:Didn't feel the incredible friendshipCertainly didn't feel the love storyThings I Learnt From This Movie:I'm starting to think that the story wasn't about friendship or love, but about undiagnosed mental illnessThat ending left me VERY uneasy",6,9,12,11 September 2018
Logan," Logan: Not the most fitting send off
","After countless delays and due to my stupidly swollen watchlist I finally got round to seeing Logan which at time of writing currently sits at #155 on IMDb's Top 250 list.Though never really a fan of the X-Men movies due to the lack of consistency and shifting timelines I've always loved Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The man has taken the character and made it is own as the likes of Robert Englund did with Freddy and for this reason I hope we don't see Wolverine again as a recast would be a travesty.Due to the high rating, rumours of the film & Jackman claiming this was his last film as Wolverine I went in with very high expectations and truth be told they simply weren't met.Don't get me wrong Logan is a good movie, Jackman is great, Keen is surprisingly competent and the movie flows nicely but it all felt very familiar and rather anti-climatic.Wolverine has become of the most iconic movie characters of the last few decades so if this was destined to be his last film we truly needed something special and I don't believe this comes under that category.Even with fantastic actors like Patrick Stewart, Richard E Grant & Stephen Merchant the movie never came close to reaching its potential and left me more than slightly let down.The ending, arguably the worst part of the film. No spoilers to be found here just wads of disappointment.After 9 films as Wolverine I salute Hugh Jackman for literally becoming a character, all the respect in the world. One does have to wonder if he'd have had as much success if he'd worn the proper Wolverine yellow spandex though!",7,13,25,26 July 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Exceeds already high expectations
","Despite being a huge comic book nerd I was not familiar with the Guardians before the first movie came out. I did some googling and upon learning about this sci-fi superhero team consisting of a talking raccoon and tree man I was hardly impressed.I finally got round to watching the first film and was blown away. It had a remarkable charm that even the other Marvel titles didn't have. It was filled with great humour, memorable moments and fit into the Marvel Universe long running story perfectly.Because of this I pumped by expectations up high for the sequel to a degree where it was almost guaranteed to fail yet somehow, someway it didn't.Not only did it meet my expectations but it exceeded them, GotG2 is amazing.Full of the same five star humour, being a visual treat and once again with an excellent soundtrack the film gripped me from the outset and delivered that charm all over again.This time including several industry veterans including Kurt Russell (Who has been on great form since his return) and Sylvester Stallone they fit in well and don't detract from the franchise as I feared they might.With cameo appearances along the way from the likes of Farscape (1999) lead Ben Browder to industry legend Seth Green as Howard the Duck this is a fun rollercoaster ride than left me positively gagging for more.This is one of those films I feel like I could rant about (In a positive way) for a while and so I'm going to resist the urge and merely say that Guardians 2 is a contender for the best Marvel movie, contested only by the first Avengers film.Masterpiece.The Good:Cast are great againCharm returnsExcellent nostalgic soundtrackLooks amazingThe Bad:Only one movie with Baby Groot? Noooo!They seem to have dropped Drax's taking everything literal jokes awayMichael Rosenbaum was wastedThings I Learnt From This Movie:Batista should have skipped over wrestling and just been an actor",9,57,78,25 March 2018
The Shape of Water," The Shape of Water: Original and beautiful
","Del Toro is such an interesting Director, his original and foreign films like the Devils Backbone (2001) and Labyrinth (2006) are masterworks, beautiful, original and near flawless. Then on the flipside he makes brainless American action films like the Hellboy/Pacific Rim movies.Thankfully this despite being American is in his original wonderful style and gripped me from the outset.It tells the story of a mute cleaner during the 60's working inside of a military base who discovers their secret 'Asset'.Starring Michael Shannon and Richard Jenkins it is flattered with a stunning soundtrack, amazing visuals and brilliant performances.Much in a film noir style The Shape Of Water is deserving of its 4 Oscars and though I don't think it's on the same level as Pans Labyrinth it is still note worthy and well worth a viewing.The Good:Looks greatFantastic scoreVery originalThe Bad:'That' dance sceneThe creature is basically Abe SapienThings I Learnt From This Movie:If a man has sex with an animal it's bestiality, if a woman does it's artistic and beautiful",8,21,36,28 April 2018
Kong: Skull Island," Kong Skull Island: Yet another unneeded return to an old franchise
","I've never liked the Kong movies, not a single one sadly. Quite frankly if I wanted to see a big dumb hairy ape pounding its chest and behaving like it's something special I'd watch a movie from the Green Street franchise.This is yet another feature with a competent cast but too much emphasis on sfx which don't actually even look as good as I expected.So it's Loki, Nick Fury and Ms Marvel vs a host of oversized creatures including cliché looking skull....stalkers? I can't even remember what he called them, I just remember cringing and wondering why was on the Scyfy Channel.The most concerning part is that the two most entertaining scenes in the entire movie are one during the credits and the modern day obligated after credits moment. They were worth watching, the rest of the film not so much.Skull Island isn't bad, it's just all so samey with nothing new brought to the table. We have the knives, we have the forks, we have a little bread basket full of warm refreshing buns, we have our glass of water and we have our meal but where is my caramel pizza & chocolate flavoured wine? This analogy sounded better in my head.",4,7,12,6 July 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," The Hobbit The Battle of the Five Armies: Despite being the most poorly received it stands as my favorite
","I was distinctly underwhelmed by the first two Hobbit movies, I thought they were good but just that 'Good'. They live in the shadow of the Lord Of The Rings movies and simply paled in comparison and so going into The Battle Of The Five Armies I expected more of the same.According to both IMDb and the profit margin this was the most poorly received of the franchise, clearly people did not like the film by comparison. But as usual, I have to be different.I consider this to not only be the best of the Hobbit franchise but also hot on the heels in quality as the LOTR trilogy.The story culminates beautifully and if you can get past the many changes that were made you'll see the finale of a wondrous tale and a battle on screen that blew me away.Once again the fantastic cast, stunning score, mind blowing effects and sheer beauty envelope you into the world of Middle Earth and I was gripped.Yes its not flawless, but it is pretty damn close.The Good:Amazing openingAction scenes are brutalJames NesbittEvangeline LillyThe Bad:Still a lot of changesFili's death was poorly done",9,54,78,1 December 2017
Wonder Woman," Wonder Woman: Just not feeling it
","I'm glad that a female fronted superhero movie actually did well at the box office, I'm appalled it took this long and was thrilled at seeing the figures.Now when I first learned Gal Gadot was due to play Wonder Woman I wasn't sold, I just saw this tall skinny girl but was proven wrong in Batman vs Superman (2016) where I thought she did great. But a standalone movie? This was the ultimate test and though I think she did well I believe her proper debut failed on a lot of fronts.A tweeked version of her origin story Wonder Woman is full of famous faces and fantastic choices for the most part, it had a tsunami of funding and a competent lead. So what went wrong?The same as Batman vs Superman in my opinion, the DC Universe is simply not getting off to a good start. Flashy, cheesy and with some awful awful dialogue Wonder Woman failed to impress.I'm not saying its a bad film, I'm just saying for every good scene there are 5 average ones and a couple of stinkers.What took me back was the CGI, this is a AAA movie so why are there so many crappy looking shots? Truly unforgivable considering the budget, the script is weak, the story is predictable and the whole thing is somehow cheesier than the original television series (And that's saying something).I went in expecting gold but came out with mildly tarnished bronze at best, I wanted to like this I really did but am so unimpressed I'm just going to assume Justice League will be seven shades of abyssmal.The Good:Great scoreWell castThe Bad:Some choreography is offSome bizzarely bad cgiVery different from the original storyBarely connects to the universe they are trying to createThings I Learnt From This Movie:Each year judging by ratings people are easier and easier to pleaseI always consider Tom Cruise unconvincing in action scenes, he looks outstanding compared to David ThewlisDC is not going to be catching up to Marvel, ever. This confirms it.",6,14,27,29 March 2018
Black Panther," Black Panther: Wow, that was an anti-climax
","I'm a Marvel fan and I think the movies have all ranged from above average to excellent with one exception, Dr Strange (2016) I simply didn't 'Get it'.Now with Black Panther the hype train was overwhelming, you couldn't turn any direction without having it shoved down your throat. From it being an amazing film to it being the first black led superhero movie, it was everywhere and therefore I expected something pretty special.For a start, it's not. In fact I'm not sure what I dislike more, this or Dr Strange. It's genuinely close. This is a mindless cgi-fest with a lackluster story and hardly feels like a Marvel movie at all.Secondly, can people pull their butts out of their heads for five minutes and get off this revolutionary ground breaking movie because of the leads ethnicity?Blade (1998) is Marvel, African American lead and 3 movies (Plus a tv show)Spawn (1997) (My favorite superhero) feature movie, African American leadCat Woman (2004) (Not even including the original Batman series) Halle Berry African American leadSteel (1997), African American leadAnd if we can touch upon comedy superhero movies we also have Blankman (1994) and Meteor Man (1993)Do I need to continue? Because I can, this isn't groundbreaking the whole thing was a publicity stunt and people ate it up with a spoon while the creators laughed all the way to the bank.Black Panther is a poor addition to the Marvel cinematic universe, it simply isn't very good but people are looking past that for all the wrong reasons. Take the blinkers off people.The Good:Andy SerkisThe suits do look greatThe Bad:Simply not engagingFeels very disconnected from the Marvel universeThings I Learnt From This Movie:This movie isn't propaganda it's an agenda, one that feels forced is dishonest and simply doesn't need to be",3,20,35,3 May 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," How to drop the ball
","On paper Batman vs Superman is one of the biggest movies of all time. The two biggest names in comics going face to face and with Wonder Woman in tow. So how did it all go so wrong? Why is it universally panned by and yet (At present time) it's IMDb rating so contradictingly high? Truth be told BVS isn't a bad film in my view, it just isn't a good one either.Where to begin? Jesse Eisenberg's performance was great but in no way did he appear to be playing Lex Luthor in anyway shape or form.Gal Gadot exceeded my expectations and played her role well.Affleck is shaping up to be a decent batman.Henry Cavill is terrible.........seriously, he's proving once again that he's the mainstream Segal. Wooden, tired & undeserving of such roles. To add to that Amy Adams fails spectacularly as Lane.Without spoilers the other 'Big Bad' is poorly represented, if they aren't willing to do it correctly why bring these characters into the film? Why not just make a new one. Smallville did a better job! The story is solid, it's the execution that lets it down.The movie has several completely baffling and unneeded sequences and it's pacing felt sporadic.Further casting problems include Fishburne as Perry because of the ethnicity change (What is it with Superhero movies & their insistence on doing that) You're telling me if Black Panther took his mask off in Civil War & he was played by Brad Pitt people wouldn't rage? Next year Dev Patel as Superman & Justin Chong as Batman.......Also Jeffrey Dean Morgan & Lauren Cohan thoroughly wasted in their 10 seconds no lines cameo appearances.My biggest problem with the film is this, just how unremarkable the film was considering the subject matter. This needed to be a supernova of a film, whereas it turned into a lit fart.",5,15,26,4 May 2016
Monsters University," Monsters University: A worthy prequel
","I adored Monsters Inc, it was one of those surprise movies you go into with no expectations and are blown away by. It took years for me to get round to this due to my endless watchlist but I'm so happy I can say that it's worth of the the franchise.Charming, well written, full of laugh out loud moments and undeniably loyal to the original movie with tie-ins around every corner.I especially liked Helen Mirrens character, part monster, part bat, part centipede? I like centipedes, I wanted to be an entomologist once upon a time, obsessed over bugs, learnt all about them then learnt about these things called university, qualifications and effort and thought against it. I'll leave entomology to those with motivation, you enjoy your bugs and I'll enjoy women, movies, video games and various other fun stuff.I digress, Monsters University is a sweet heartfelt movie and makes me hope they make a final part to make a monsters trilogy. Maybe touching upon certain events that happened in this as opposed to it's sequel.Sadly I don't see this happening, I think we have more likelihood of a Princess Bride 2, Brave 2 or a movie where Zac Efron doesn't play an arrogant douche who likes to take his shirt off.",8,26,26,11 July 2017
Before Sunrise," Before Sunrise: Don't see the appeal
","Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy meet in this critically acclaimed feature presently at time of writing sat at no.214 on IMDb's top 250 movies. They meet, they chat and that's basically the concept of the film.I'm all for 'Talkies' but when they have a plot, a purpose, an aim. This seems to lack that and all the core basics a movie must have such as a beginning a middle and an end.Performances are great, the movie is visually appealing but that's as far as it personally goes for me.It's like 90 minutes of having a camera in the Big Brother house and just listening to them waffle on. Only difference is that here the subjects are capable of using words with more than 2 syllable's and aren't desperate Z list celebrity wannabes.Boring, lifeless and I simply don't see the appeal. Out of morbid curiosity I'm sure I'll get round to seeing it's 2 sequels but since I watched Sharknado 2 & 3 that's really not saying much.",3,7,11,15 July 2017
Life," Life: Expectations obliterated
","I'm not a fan of these AAA Hollywood blockbusters, I'm not a fan of sci-fi and I really don't like Jake Gyllenhaal so I was prepared to hate this film! With the usually excellent Ryan Reynolds not being on form, a rather lifeless cast and wall to wall clichés it was looking like my fears were being confirmed.Then something weird happened, it....got....good.The movie became overwhelmingly tense, the film gripped me and suddenly I was hooked.The plot though hardly original heavily reminded me of an episode of the Outer Limits that starred Michael 'Worf' Dorn and is certainly a fantastic premise.Ending with a predictable but very impressive finale Life exceeded all my expectations and I believe a sequel would work.The Good: Very tense and well constructed The Bad: Jake GyllenhaalThings I learnt from this movie: I should watch more sci-fi (No scyfy channel not you)",8,21,33,22 August 2017
Annihilation," Annihilation: What a peculiar film
","Annihilation reminds me of The Sound of Thunder (2005), not entirely sure why. I did however enjoy SoT, I didn't so much this.Starring Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason-Leugh and Tessa Thompson it has a very unusual plot I wouldn't even dream of summarizing here. Rest assured however nobody could accuse this of of being your standard Hollywood affair.Visually it's a treat with some startling beautiful visuals and plenty of nice ideas to go with them. It would be hard to dispute that Annihilation doesn't have its merits.It does however also have its flaws and plenty of them. For me it was poorly paced, it didn't exactly flow and the nice ideas don't feel entirely followed through. It plays the role of a smart movie that dives deep into the pseudo-scientific realms but alike many other similar movies just doesn't come across all that clever.More an experience than a movie I'd consider this very niche stuff.The Good:Some real beautiful imageryA few good ideasThe Bad:Doesn't all come together very wellThings I Learnt From This Movie:Natalie Portman and Keira Knightly are the same person. Have they been in a movie together? Exactly, got you thinking right?I'm still waiting to understand the Oscar Isaac appeal",4,34,61,12 December 2018
Alien: Covenant," Alien Covenant: Meh!
","I've always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with the Alien franchise. I want to like them, but they rarely seem to entertain to the extent I believe they should.Alien: 5Aliens: 10Alien 3: 3Alien Resurrection: 5Alien vs Predator: 5Alien vs Predator Requiem: 3Prometheus: 5For this reason I didn't expect much from Covenant and got essentially what I thought I would. It's not that it's bad, it's just clichéd Hollywood predictable nonsense and didn't feel like an Alien movie. Granted it felt more like one than Prometheus but didn't come close to the pinnacle of greatness that was Aliens (1986)To its credit at least it had the old school Alien, even though I'm still not keen on seeing them in light. I miss them coming from the shadows and you only getting to see a part of them at a time.Danny McBride was less obnoxious as usual and exceeded my expectations in a straight role. But Michael Fassbender, too much Hollywood too much.Alien Covenant is a harmless film but doesn't meet the hype, doesn't contribute anything to the Alien universe and simply failed to impress.The Good:One great death sceneDanny McBrideThe Bad:Michael Fassbender, I am so over this guyThe first death, really!?",5,10,16,30 August 2017
Rock Star," Rock Star: I should have liked this more
","Rock Star tells the story of the lead singer of a tribute band who get's to live out his dreams on a much grander stage. Starring Mark Wahlberg, Jennifer Aniston, Timothy Spall and Timthy Olyphant it certainly doesn't lack star power.As you'd imagine being a movie about classic/glam rock the soundtrack is fantastic, right up there among the best of them though shatter any illusions you may have that it was Wahlberg singing.It's big, it's stylish and to my knowledge it's pretty damn accurate so why am I not rating this higher? I like the cast, I'm an old school rocker myself and on paper this should be a guaranteed tick in the win column from me.The construction of a movie is simple, you need a beginning a middle and an end and Rock Star has that but in a rather disjointed way. The films construction is my biggest grip, it comes across more like a Behind the Music episode than an actual movie. The protagonist walks away having learned several life lessons but the viewer (Or rather in this viewers case) it felt more empty than it should have.Rock Star is an interesting enough look at a subject rarely touched upon by the mainstream Hollywood movie industry but perhaps needed an additional 30+ minute to really flesh it out.The Good:Great castAwesome soundtrackSome brilliant visualsFirst movie ever to make Timothy Spall a successful 'Good guy'The Bad:Olyphant feels wastedOddly builtI struggled to feel for our leadsThings I Learnt From This Movie:Jennifer Aniston holds the secret of eternal youthThey could/should have found Wahlberg a better wigBallet is where rock stars go to die",6,4,5,30 May 2018
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Talladega Nights The Ballad of Ricky Bobby: Meh, it was okay
","Talladega Nights is one of those movies I was rather shocked I hadn't seen, it was high profile, I don't mind Ferrell's work and you see it referenced all time yet it's taken me this long to get around to it.I expected generic Hollywood drivel and it is, but thanks to some decent writing (In places) I'd say it's an above par effort (Just).With a vast who's who cast and co-written by Ferrell himself this tells the story of Nascar driver Ricky Bobby as he reaches the pinnacle of the industry only to lose it all when a rival turns up and takes his spot.With Greg Germann playing the same character he always does, namely the really easy to hate villainous type and Sacha Baron Cohen whom I simply cannot abide for some reason. Regarding him I have to say I admire his work and him as a human being, I just can't stand him in anything I've seen thus far!The film adopts all the usual tropes you'd expect and is hugely paint by numbers, it's incredible cast feel rather wasted though it was really nice to see Gary Cole as it always is.Some of the writing caught me off guard with how good it was, sadly that only happened 3-4 times and the rest is really generic stuff.If you like standard Hollywood comedy you can do worse, if you want something you haven't seen a hundred times before then hop, skip and jump over it.The Good:Gary ColeSome surprisingly good humorSome great songs on the soundtrackThe Bad:Sacha Baron CohenUsual formula",6,6,9,26 March 2019
