Blade Runner 2049," Slow is good
",I am impressed that they managed to get the feel of the original Blade Runner so well. Pros: - Took time to tell the story and get you feel the story. - There is no right or wrong just like in the original. Only questions placed and choices made - There is no real ending. Yes someone dies someone does not but there is no real ending left to it. It is more about the future endings it allows to happen. - Unbelievable cinematography and sense of pace. Plain beautiful Cons: - Not really clear why all is happening in the first place. I like the moral question in the original movie but find somewhat difficult understand what is the question here. Is it about androids being real people? Is it about them becoming human or actually not wanting to become human? - Honestly - should have killed Harrison Ford :-) Although he did play very well.,9,2,8,9 October 2017
