Walk the Line," I love this movie!!
","I am in love with this movie! I had never really listened Johnny Cash's stuff, but after this movie i fell in love with his music. It has a sort of humor in it, and meaning. My favorite parts in this movie are when June Carter throws the beer bottles and Elvis, Jerry Lee...etc. say 'We surrender', also when Johnny purposes to June on stage in front of millions people, by TV, live, radio, and so on. It takes a lot of guts to do something like that in front of millions of people. Yeah, he made mistakes in life between drugs, drinking, and a little anger, but inside he had a great heart. It's way too bad that June and he had to die. They were true love, weren't they? People have said He died of a broken heart, when June died 4 months before. Overall I will always and forever love this movie!!",10,1,2,26 November 2006
