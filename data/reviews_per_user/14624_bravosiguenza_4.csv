It," It... meh
","The real problem with this movie is that it never quite creates a tense atmosphere because they rely so much on the visual creepyness of the clown, and it ultimately wears off. By the second half of the movie you just start seeing predictable clown sightings with no interesting outcome whatsoever.
Also there's this trend in horror movies of adding comedy bits sporadically, killing any possibility of suspense (bathroom-cleaning scene anyone?).
Acting and photography are really really good, but the weakness of the screenplay downplays everything.",6,0,1,25 January 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Did all happen this way?
","Although highly entertaining and visually appealing, clichÃ©d dialogues and fast-paced events leave you wonder how much of what we're seeing is historically verifiable. I understand they must fit a lot of information in one hour and a half, but I'm sure there are more credible ways to accomplish this. Audio mixing and audio design were fantastic, as well as the Live Aid takes.",7,2,4,7 November 2018
It Chapter Two," Twice as long ain't twice as good
","What's the goal of this film?
Without intelligent storytelling and without the correct atmosphere, an horror movie becomes just a noisy collage of frames.
After a decent first act, recurring jump-scares and cliches (lots (LOTS) of them) make you get tired of this film. It's a 3 hour loop of 'guy walking alone in town. guy sees something creepy. guy gets scared (even though it's clear for him/her that the situation not real). Clown shows teeth and makes loud noises. Clown stops the attack abruptly'.
At the end, the hope of an epic final battle vanishes with the anti-climatic solution that they could have figured out since the first part.
Humor is slightly better timed, but still manages to break the tense atmosphere that every horror movie should build. This movie is a big NOPE from me.",4,1,3,11 September 2019
Signs," A must-miss!
","What you will find in this film:-Ridiculous plot elements: such as the water thing, and the totally unnecessary back-story explanation of Joaquin Phoenix character.-Risible dialogue: lil' Culkin giving a speech to her 5-year-old sister about the importance of documenting the invasion so their sons will know their parents were there. Also Mel Gibson cursing (' Ahh! I'm insane with anger!')-Poor acting: there would have been more emotionality and gesticulation in carboard cut-outs of the cast. Just terrible. -Cheap CGI. Not even the characters in the film were scared of the alien.-Coincidental Broadcast cliché: Turning the news on precisely at the right moment EVERY SINGLE TIME. Someone please stop Shyamalan from making movies.",1,4,8,15 January 2018
