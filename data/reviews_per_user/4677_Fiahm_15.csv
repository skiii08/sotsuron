Blade Runner 2049," Starts So Well, Goes Bad Fast
","Burned over and over again by every 'remake' and 'reboot' that has squelched its way out of Hollywood the past 10 years or so, I went into this with deep distrust and skepticism, so was therefore very surprised to find it open so strongly, with the world of the original Blade Runner faithfully recreated and built upon, and a sturdy performance by Ryan Gosling at its center. True, it doesn't seem to add up to much or say anything, and Jared Leto is an incomprehensible mess, but for the first hour and a half you don't really mind, just because it's so nice to look at and the care and attention on display. It really only starts to go downhill once Harrison Ford appears on screen. Now correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I can ascertain, Harrison Ford has not actually acted ONCE the past quarter century. And here, as with his shameful cameo in 'The Farce Awakens', he simply turns up, trembles his lip, looks like he's going to cry and then dodders about onscreen looking confused for about 10 minutes total, runs off with his big sack of cash and takes off to fly his plane. And as with that previous spin of the grave of Han Solo, there is nothing beyond the obvious surface physical resemblance to link whatever he is doing onscreen here to the character of Deckard in the original. The film is easily a good half hour too long, and way before the credits roll you realize it hasn't added up to anything, or said anything new, or done anything to equal the original. There was never any need to make a sequel to Blade Runner, but the first two thirds of this film did the best job of attempting it anyone could have hoped for. Yes, it all leads to nothing, but it's still an admirable achievement all the same, so how to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10 I really don't know.",4,1,6,1 January 2018
Captain Marvel," Captain Mary Sue
","So first off, and most importantly: if you are looking for a film in which you can see lots of little girls lie down in sand and then stand up in slow motion, then yes, this is the film for you. Ditto if you want to hear an incredibly ill-placed Gwen Stefani song about girl power played over a pivotal dramatic battle scene.On the other hand, if you are wanting to see a film with engrossing, likeable characters you care about on a plausible adventure you can have fun watching, you are bang out of luck, my friend.Having said that, although Captain Marvel is, without any shadow of a doubt, a bad film, it's actually not quite as irredeemable as I'd been bracing myself for, and there *are* parts that feel much like your average Marvel movie in happier days. The main flaws are, as every other review on this site will have already told you, the thoroughly wooden unlikeability of Brie Larson's character, and the shoehorning of crass feminist/SJW politics into the story where there is simply no need. As has happened in the comics in recent years, the character Captain Marvel is presented as a perfect paragon of popularity but at no point does she ever behave like someone the audience would actually like in real life: she acts bitter-faced and snarky with everyone she meets, never caring for others (except certain 'victim groups' to make a political point) or displaying any real warmth or humanity. She is never shown to be trying to help or befriend anyone she meets, and yet everyone either likes and respects her immediately, or else is easily crushed by her. She never has to learn that there are flaws in herself - she's not a cowardly or money-hungry character that eventually learns there are things more important than herself that push her to overcome her weakness or greed - she simply learns that others have been 'holding her back'.At one point in the film she gains enormous powers just by contemplating how splendid she is, and then later on closes her eyes while falling and, with a smug smile, discovers she can fly. No further explanation for these astoundingly miraculous events is ever forthcoming. We just come to accept that she can do EVERYTHING. She starts out flawless and ends the same way. This is boring.I should also add that what the filmmakers did to Samuel L. Jackson's character is a crime, too. His Nick Fury in this film bears no relation to the one he plays in every other film. This is simply a different person altogether, present only for light relief and positive skin pigmentation representation.As with the Star Wars franchise and other current films, excellence and originality have been replaced by mediocrity and hollow virtue signalling, with writers, directors, actors, characters and storylines being selected for arbitrary surface characteristics and political allegiances rather than merit and magic. This whole period is going to be considered a shameful stain on the history of the art of cinema in generations to come, and Captain Marvel a prime example.",3,10,20,26 September 2019
The Irishman," The Only Film I've Seen All Year
","This is the only film I've seen all year.Now don't get me wrong, I've seen a whole lot of moving images with weeping actors and swelling music and pretty lighting and expensive CGI and all that. But they weren't actually FILMS, just a bunch of stage directions and cliched gibberish thrown together by lethargic boardroom committees of affirmative action-hired hacks and screentested before herds of ADD-afflicted cattle.This, on the other hand, is a genuine work of cinema, with every scene a pleasure, culminating in the kind of thoroughly satisfying, harmonious whole that at some undisclosed point in the past decade became just a thing of the past. It's now true to say they don't make them like this anymore: there's no identity politics, no feminism, no product placement, no hiring quotas, no awkwardly-inserted fashionable causes or talking points. Just a really good, solid story, perfectly told, beautifully shot and immaculately acted by every single player in the film. EVERYONE brings their A-game. No-one coasts and grabs the money and runs. It's as if everyone knows this is almost certainly the last mob film Scorsese will ever direct, and they all want to be a part of history, which this is. It's an instant classic.True, it may retread ground we've walked before in earlier Scorsese movies like Goodfellas, and even later TV shows inspired by those, such as The Sopranos. But we don't care, because that ground is such a rare and rewarding place to be.Really, the only weak spot I can think of is that de Niro never once looks or sounds like an Irishman, and his blue contact lenses occasionally make his eyes look like some kind of alien lizard. Which is a little distracting. Also, the digital de-aging was possibly not needed. But that's honestly all I can complain of: it's his best performance in over 20 years, all the way back to Jackie Brown and Casino. And it's the best Pacino has been in all that time, too. Amazing to see him working with Scorsese at last.I don't know how much of the story is true, but then in this case I don't really care all that much, I was just glad to be along for the ride. And even after 3Â½ hours, I didn't want that ride to end.",9,6,15,29 November 2019
Aquaman," So, So, So, So, So, So Bad
","'Aquaman' was so, so, so, so, so, so bad... It started out mind-numbingly predictable, but I thought 'well, it might still be a fun, colourful bit of disposable fluff regardless'. But then it got worse, and worse, and worse, and worse, and worse.Not one single 'character' behaved in an interesting, believable or relatable manner, and the script appeared to have been written by someone who had never actually seen a movie before but had instead been raised exclusively on World of Warcraft.And actually, the experience of the 'film' was more like one of those youtube videos watching someone else playing a video game, passively observing someone else constantly 'unlocking levels' and being fed endless new challenges ('now you gotta get the OTHER trident!') with no reason for any of them to matter to the viewer.Every attempt at humour fell flat and seemed out of character for characters that paradoxically had no character, and every time any of the actors (and particularly the actresses) had to do anything but walk forward in a straight line, they were replaced by terrible computer game CGI animation. I was trying to figure out if ANY of the scenes were not just shot in a big green room but I could only count about four.The only positive thing I could find to say about the whole embarrassing affair is that sometimes the pretty coloured lights looked sorta nice, once in awhile. That really is it. For a $200,000,000 budget.My GOD, it's bad. Even Captain Marvel has to be better than this(!)",1,11,23,6 March 2019
Thor: Ragnarok," The Golden Age of Marvel Movies May Be On The Wane
","After the success of Deadpool and Guardians Of The Galaxy (both fine, fun, movies, by the way) the magic of Marvel - i.e, believable characters you care about in unbelievable situations, with a unique balance of gripping drama, action and lively humour - seems to be tipping more and more into only humour. In doing so, they risk losing what made them so special in the first place. I noticed this recently in the noisy and chaotic mess that was Spiderman Homecoming, and the flimsiness of the technically dazzling Dr Strange.The new Thor movie is another step in that direction, and the most obviously unbalanced. This wouldn't necessarily be that big a deal if they could somehow make the comedy seem natural extension of the characters and believable, but they fall down quite majorly here too: I didn't recognize Cate Blanchett until the closing credits, which is strange, since I'm quite I'm a fan of her, but she seems out of sorts here and unable to maintain a convincing tone for her character who remains not the least bit godlike throughout. At no point in the movie does she successfully personify the death of all things but rather a bitchy soccer mom at a class reunion.None of the familiar characters talk or act anything like how we remember them - Odin is gone in the blink of an eye and his death means nothing. Loki is completely wasted and does nothing at all Loki-like. Thor himself has gone from being a dazzling manifestation of an ancient, otherworldly GOD to... just being a big doofus, really. And there was no reason at all for that god-damned haircut, by the way, which only works against the believability of the character even more.The Hulk, too, goes from being the ultimate depiction of unstoppable force in human form to ALSO being... well, just a big doofus too. No reason is given for why he does not revert to Banner when he has calmed down enough to bounce a ball around or get in a hot tub, and he holds lengthy Abbot & Costello-like comedic conversations in a manner he hasn't in 50 years of comic books. There's nothing to identify him as a character: if you swopped the CGI covering him for one of the other brightly coloured and slow-witted alien monsters, you'd never know it was him.The central tragedies at the heart of all these characters - which, after all, define them - are here almost completely excised, along with the gravity of the thousands and thousands of deaths of the Asgardians. Some long-recurring characters are literally in the film for 10 seconds or so before being killed, but there's no space made for the mourning needed to make such an event resonate and matter, and by the end of the film it's as if none of it ever happened. All this unbelievable loss of life, and yet at every turn, every scene is played for laughs.Ultimately, the film plays like a satire of the film you actually paid to see - it's a little like going to see the new Star Trek movie and finding it to actually be Galaxy Quest. This was great for Guardians Of The Galaxy and Deadpool, but tonally way out of balance for a tragic family saga of ancient gods.Don't get me wrong, a bunch of it IS fun, it's just fun that doesn't make any sense, hang together as a story, or mean anything. Yes, it's a colourful and frothy space romp, and there's stuff within that to be enjoyed. But next time, more care and depth and a decent script, please.",3,4,13,15 November 2017
BlacKkKlansman," Cliché Upon Cliché Upon Cliché
","The sad thing about the present spate of Hollywood social commentary-infested movies is just how utterly predictable all of them are: once you know the subject matter you know the message, and once you know the message you know the movie you're going to see.I wanted to hold back on my initial suspicions to give this film the benefit of the doubt, but there was no real reason to - it's a Spike Lee film, and there's a bunch of black people in it: you therefore know what it's going to say and how it's going to say it. You know how every black person's going to behave and you know how every white person's going to behave. And of course they do.John David Washington can act, but his character, like all the other characters, is little more than a cartoon stereotype, this time with a wig on his head that looks like a microphone pop-shield. The 70s period detail kinda looks like a live-action Scooby-Doo, and the hysterical race war politics crammed into every human interaction with a crowbar kinda resemble something Shaggy might have come up with after too many Scooby Snacks at an Elijah Muhammad rally.Spike Lee is not a good director, and has never BEEN a good director: he is incapable of telling, pacing and selling a believable story, and his most celebrated works are little deeper and more developed than the average rap video. The only half-entertaining movie he ever made was Inside Man, and I wish he'd go back to the drawing board and learn how to make something like that again. Something with recognizably human characters in a plausible narrative, and at least a little sprinkling of surprise.",2,195,365,29 January 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," My Spidey Sense Is Not Tingling
","So I'm just back from seeing Spiderman: Homecoming, which I have been looking forward to for ages: I'm a big Marvel movie fan. There are weaker ones (The Dark World, Iron Man 2) and there are stronger ones (Winter Soldier, Civil War, Avengers 1) but I've been having more reliable a good time at pretty much every one of them I've seen than anything else happening in cinema this century, so I had every expectation this one was going to fill me with equal glee.Right from the opening scenes, though, something felt a little off, in both tone and pace: first of all it felt like it was trying too hard to be 'young', 'hip' and 'fun' to actually BE young, hip and fun, and the end result seemed to me simply cluttered, forced and frantic.Secondly, the forced diversity and heavy-handed political interjections left a sour taste in the mouth - much like Marvel's presently failing line of comics. Up till now the cinematic universe has escaped this kind of preachy, fun-spoiling PC propaganda, and it makes me wonder what this forebodes for future Marvel movies, especially the eternally unpopular Captain Marvel, which no-one wants and yet is inexplicably due to be with us in about 18 months, for no other reason, as far as anyone can discern, but that the character is female.I was aware by about halfway through that the only time I had even chuckled was at a couple of the throwaway Captain America jokes, whereas I bust a gut at Guardians and Ant Man and Dr Strange and The Avengers and just about every other Marvel film. Not a good sign.Other problems? Well, the showcasing of Iron Man throughout pretty much sidelines Spidey from his own movie. Spiderman messes up, Iron Man comes saves the day. Repeat. There's also way, way too much technology in it and stuff about the suit - true, that itself becomes part of the story in the last third of the film ('If you're nothing without this suit, then you shouldn't have it') but by then we've already had to sit through an hour or more of unfunny jokes about Peter messing up in it and falling over like a clown and saying 'derp'. This much attention on the ultimately unnecessary outer garment means at times the film seems far too close to the stories of Ant Man or Iron Man himself, to the degree it can't help but actually feel derivative and old hat.Spiderman was never about technology - he never needed a special suit because he already had SUPERPOWERS, but other than a generic superhero strength, none of those unique abilities (the 'spidey sense', the natural ability to stick to walls, etc) are at all on display in the film.So what was good? Well, the three leads - Tom Holland, Michael Keaton and, to a lesser extent, Robert Downey Jr (who was literally phoning in a lot of it). Nothing extraordinary, and very little depth, but solid and likable acting all round. Unfortunately, all of the secondary and tertiary characters - and there are oodles of them - are as thin as tissue paper and about as integral to the story. No-one is likable, or memorable, and Peter's useless fat friend is by far the most annoying character you will see this year.What else? I liked the Vulture's suit when he was flying, and some of the special effects were good, although the fight scenes at the end were cut too fast to be able to see what was going on, which kind of defeats the purpose.Overall, this is a movie too intent on grabbing a younger audience, at the expense of anyone else tuning in. The liberties taken with the original source material are all to the detriment of the story, and the 'fun! fun! fun!' agenda means there is no genuine drama or depth of feeling, and hence no characters we can invest in or care about. It isn't that it's a bad film at all, it's just a long way off being a good one, or even good enough.",3,7,18,12 July 2017
Doctor Strange," Quite Possibly The Most Authentically Psychedelic Movie You'll Ever See
","Early on, during one of the first of many mind - and reality - bending moments in this film, it hit me that the 'Marvel Cinematic Universe' movies made the past 10 years are going to be seen in a half-century's time as just as classic and golden an age of film making as Disney's heyday in the 1940s, or at the very least, Pixar's rule of animation from the 90s on.Yes, some are weaker than others - the second Thor film and the third Iron Man, for starters - but at their best they are very close to perfect, and so clearly what all those woefully misguided blockbuster abominations like The Force Awakens and Batman Vs Superman want to be. The elusive Marvel formula has been a fantastic balance of action, humour and heart, and this has all of those in spades - although if I have to pick any fault with it, it might be that the emotional charge is not as high as one might hope, and that's pretty much the only reason I took a star away. It was also apparent some PC coercion had influenced the casting and depictions of characters (white characters made black, male characters made female, and the only 'bad' or flawed characters in it being white males), but this was relatively restrained and unobtrusive and it would be churlish to kick up too much of a fuss over.The most obvious comparison to the visual effects on display would be Inception, but I was struck while watching it, with my mouth open and a permanent smile of wonderment on my face, how this film technically surpasses everything in that film (and every other film I've seen too), but also how far more FUN it is than Inception.So there we go, Dr Strange is a splendid, exciting, marvellously fun concoction that future generations are going to adore just as much as we do today. That's a rarity, and worth noticing while it happens.",8,19,37,25 October 2016
Joker," Jokery-Pokery
","It's somewhat fortuitous that I saw the pilot episode of that dreadful Batwoman TV show on the same day I saw Joker. The two seem such polar opposites - one is rabid intersectionalist propaganda clumsily shaped by a newly-menstruating 13-year old into something that is almost *entirely* unlike anything recognizable as an actual story, with actual characters and believable situations, dialogue and acting.The other is... well, something other than that - I'm not entirely sure what, but whatever that something is, it can't help but come as something of a relief.The trailers at the cinema were for Feminist Terminator, Feminist Star Wars and 'The Emancipation of Harley Quinn': all explicitly anti-male, openly and unapologetically attacking and tearing down men and masculinity - and at the same time still fully expecting to appeal to the great majority of action, sci-fi and superhero fans, who have always been male.In 2019 it's hard to be a man and go to the cinema or turn on the TV without being told you're obsolete, or 'toxic', or just the biggest problem facing the world today since cancer. In 2019, Joker is the only big film which doesn't do that, the only film which looks at a straight white man as first and foremost a fragile human being in need of love, care, protection and help. In 2019, this, apparently, is a terrible, dangerous, unforgiveable and revolutionary act.Ho hum.* * *So look, the film has its strengths and weaknesses:On the plus side there is, as everyone knows, Joaquin Phoenix's astonishing performance - one of the most gripping pieces of screen acting ever. His Joker is just every tortured, beaten, defeated soul wrapped up in a weak, paper-thin shell that is slowly tearing apart and open before our eyes. He does a great job of showing the effects of the 'double bind' - the strain of being constantly instructed to do (or not do) opposing, contradictory or sometimes impossible things, which can snap an overburdened mind and at least potentially play a role in bringing on schizophrenia. I noticed several deliberately placed moments illustrating this early on in the movie.Secondly, the gorgeous cinematography, on grainy celluloid immediately makes one feel one is watching a stone-cold classic movie from the very start. It feels very much like it could have been shot in 1982 by Martin Scorcese, and there are vigorous nods to both Taxi Driver and The King Of Comedy, as well as a bunch of other 70s crime films. I enjoyed that paying homage aspect of it very much.Thirdly, it is a gritty, realistic, serious and seriously made film - the like of which is rarely attempted today, and of course never as a superhero movie. This, though, is not entirely good news, which brings us to the minuses:The minuses are it's not a superhero movie of any kind. Grey-haired Joaquin seems a little too old for an origin story, and tone-wise, the only film that this could conceivably be a prequel to is The Dark Knight, and even that at a considerable stretch. I repeat for emphasis: Joker is not a superhero movie. Nothing extraordinary or fantastical happens that diverges from the ordinary wretched reality you can read about each day in the newspaper headlines. Because of that, it is quite a considerable downer, never really feels as though it leaves the ground, and eventually one does long for the days of Cesar Romero trapping Adam West in a huge yellow shoe or something.The more realistic you try to make a superhero comic book story, the less fantastical, and thereby enjoyable and entertaining the story will be. The single, solitary exception to this, the one film that captured lightning in a bottle, which DC have been catastrophically failing to repeat ever since, is The Dark Knight, and perhaps the greatest weakness of this present film is that it tries to take that realism even further, to a point where even the memory of the character the film is being based on in the first place is lost.In the final analysis, the whole thing just doesn't up to an awful lot, and without the fantastical superhero element the premise in retrospect seems a small and silly thing to base a film on. It feels much more like a biopic of an overly-bullied high school shooter in a clown mask, not a supervillain able to take on little Bruce Wayne all grown up in a batcopter. Phoenix's Joker is so debilitated and weak, with not one single strength or talent on display, it's impossible to imagine him surrounded by henchmen and weilding joke-shop weapons of mass destruction while strapping on a hi-tech utility belt.None of the other characters are fleshed out even a little, and no-one else's acting is in anything like the same league as the lead. Even though his King Of Comedy is an enormous influence on this film, every time Robert de Niro appears on the screen it just reminds us how he can't be bothered to act anymore, hasn't acted in decades, and now just turns up to collect the money. I have no real complaints about anyone else in the movie, but this is a one man show, and Joaquin Phoenix is the man.Politically, the film seems to have nothing to say and the constant nods in that direction are muddled and confused and seemingly just there for show. No ideas introduced are dealt with or resolved. It's a film of surfaces.For all this complaining, though, it's a shallow film that's still something of a must-see, for the mood, the look, the intensity, and Joaquin Phoenix's creepy ol' laugh.",7,1,1,9 October 2019
Stranger Than Fiction," The Nice Little Film That Dreamed Too Big
","I rewatched this again tonight for the first time since it came out, and remembered nothing at all about it going in but the premise, along with the lingering impression that it was a fairly likeable mainstream Hollywood attempt at fabricating some of that elusive Charlie Kaufman 'Being John Malkovich' magic and acclaim.And the thing is, it's such a lovely premise - a man becomes aware he is a character in a book and due to be killed off - but the film has no way of satisfactorily ending it. It aspires to have as grand a finale as Emma Thompson's character's novel within the film, but likewise chickens out and so ends up a puzzling and pointless mediocrity, which no amount of swelling music, uplifting montages and platitudes can obscure.I enjoyed my time spent with the characters, and indeed, there's a lot to like about every one of them, and every actor playing them. But by the end one feels, unfortunately, that it has been all for nothing and that the filmmakers were floundering out of their depth almost from the start, not knowing what they wanted to say or how to say it.",6,2,3,28 October 2019
Murder on the Orient Express," Everything That Is Wrong With Hollywood In 2017
","This particular murder of the Orient Express is almost the perfect snapshot of everything wrong with the bewildered and ailing dream factory of Hollywood in the 21st century: remaking things that don't need remaking, adding presently fashionable political causes - as well as lashings and lashings of CGI - and removing all the qualities which made the originals so beloved in the first place, such as a plausible and well told story, peopled with characters one feels a connection to and can remember 5 minutes after it's over. Like the Guy Ritchie travesty of Sherlock, Stock & Two Smoking Holmes, Kenneth Brannagh has crowbarred into this genteel whodunnit a glut of fistfights, love interests (for Poirot!), and Hobbit-looking computer-generated backdrops that end up making every outdoor scene look like a video game. Racial themes and dialogue addressing said racial themes are pulled out of the air and clumsily forced into the story where they never have felt the need to appear before in 80 years of dramatizations, and in ways that only hold up or detract from the original tale, taking up time that could have been used to elucidate various plot points (such as the explanation for the number of knife wounds in the murder) which would have strengthened the internal logic of the movie and the emotional weight.Brannagh, too, is unmemorable in everything but his mustache in his performance as Poirot, and is physically entirely wrong for the part. His Poirot doesn't actually get to bust out his wing chung moves, or pop a cap in anybody's derrière, but it's not far off. STOP 'REBOOTING' THINGS THAT WERE PERFECTLY FINE THE FIRST TIME ROUND! The magic of cinema is in its immortalizing of fleeting moments of beauty and greatness for all time - Casablanca is right there on the shelf for you to experience any time you want to: it doesn't need turning into an Adam Sandler musical set in space.But if you're GOING to carry on regardless, then try be faithful to the narrative you are telling, concentrate first and foremost on a flawless story, and on getting unforgettable moments and performances out of your cast and crew up there on the screen for eternity. This film contains not even one, and all the problems I've listed above will look worse and worse and worse to every successive generation that watches this from here on, until it falls into deserved obscurity and is forgotten completely 30 years from now.It's a handsomely designed movie, doing its sweaty-faced best to make the sleeping car-bound mystery as big and cinematic as possible, and I applaud Kenneth Brannagh for trying, but I could tell even from the film poster this was going to be a travesty, and it was.",4,5,10,11 February 2018
Parasite," Crime & Class
","An impoverished family finds ways to worm themselves into a wealthy household, until an unexpected turn of events throws their plans into disorder._________Parasite is the best Korean film I've seen for quite awhile, though it's not without its flaws. Even allowing for poor translation, a good deal of the dialogue is weak and hard to follow, several plot threads are introduced that don't go anywhere or end up being satisfactorily explained, and too many elements (the morse code, for instance) stretch credulity and feel crowbarred in because they are necessary for the story the makers want to tell, rather than making any sense *within* that story.But for all that, Parasite reminds me of everything that is so great and different about Korean cinema: a twisted, amoral, mischevious inventiveness, interspersing thoroughly leftfield turns with out-of-nowhere snatches of shocking and perfectly choreographed violence that make you involuntarily laugh out loud in both horror and admiration (in this instance, at a kick down some stairs). I honestly never saw the twist in this one coming at all, and it's a doozy, taking the film in an entirely different direction to what I'd been expecting.Though not as great as its accompanying hype is saying, Parasite is still one of the most original and enjoyable films this year and definitely worth a look.",7,23,40,1 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," a safe re-run of past well-performing brand names given a fresh lick of paint by talentless hacks in the service of corporate greed
","So I've been doing my damnedest to avoid The Force Awakens but was sufficiently bored today to get sucked into its gravitational field along with just about the entirety of the rest of the western hemisphere, it seems.The new Star Wars cash-in is a terribly dull, unoriginal, empty and uninspiring facsimile of a movie made by shareholder meetings and accountants brunches that I nearly walked out of more than once. There were no Jar-Jars and midichlorians in it, it's true, and we should be thankful for that, but there was nothing new in it to take their place, either: it added nothing whatsoever to the existing universe or overall story, and instead of moving it forward was - as many others have said already - for the most part simply a remake of the first film that started it all.Han and Leia looked frail and doddery and had almost nothing of substance to do - I would be surprised if Carrie Fisher's role required more than a day and a half of shooting, and Harrison Ford was apparently simply told 'look regretful once in awhile' and that was about it for the acting. I saw the film only hours ago and cannot recall even one single line of dialogue from it.None of the much-loved returning characters DID anything to remind you why you loved them in the first place, they were just wheeled onto the set, propped up with sticks and then wheeled back off to the nursing home again afterwards. And the new actors were all bland, characterless and immediately forgettable, with the possible exception of Adam Driver, who starts out very well but like the rest of the cast has nothing to do by the end and his character has become an inexplicably weak shadow of himself by then.The only flickers of enjoyment in the whole sorry affair came from nostalgia: the ruins of an AT-AT, half-covered by sand in the desert; the reappearance of the Millennium Falcon. All the rest was a safe re-run of past well-performing brand names given a fresh lick of paint by talentless hacks in the service of corporate greed, with no surprises and no discernible story requiring telling at the heart of it.I didn't quite feel my childhood was being raped in front of me, but I know it's the last Star Wars film I'll ever pay to see. I guess at least I got that hard-won knowledge out of the experience, but that is all.",1,50,61,5 January 2016
Da 5 Bloods," Another Joyless Spike Lee Joint
","First off, let's remember once again that Spike Lee is not a good filmmaker. He's never BEEN a good filmmaker. The otherwise inexplicably boundless patience and goodwill the media and the industry have repeatedly shown his film student-level back catalogue can only be explained through a desire to be complimentary towards him simply because of his skin colour. Which is pretty demeaningly racist in itself, when you think of it. It would be lovely to have some great black filmmakers in the world (or even one) but Spike Lee is not it.Lee is incapable of making compelling stories with believable, engaging characters in them, and everything wrong with his other films are just as wrong with this: 'Da 5 Bloods' is preachy, overlong, racially antagonistic, staggeringly self-indulgent and clumsily unbelievable in every way at every turn. Anytime any topic that could be considered even slightly political pops its head up, the scene stops and Lee starts sermonizing. The arrogance of Spike Lee shaming black people into voting (and thinking) how he wants does not seem that far off to me from Joe Biden telling them 'if you don't vote for me, you ain't black!'But okay, enough about that.The opening scenes, summing up the mood of the Vietnam War years, are powerful, if manipulative, and the use of Marvin Gaye's peerless 'Inner City Blues' is well-used and welcome. But then the actual story begins and if it wasn't a black cast, we would all be talking about it as if it were a Chuck Norris/Steven Seagal straight-to-video turkey. The actual Vietnam flashbacks look like they came from an episode of The A-Team (with the same music).Every non-black character is a prop, there to just perform a single function and then leave, with no insight into their inner thoughts, feelings, or desires. But the lead cast aren't any better: one of the guys is a Trump supporter, so he does all the bad stuff; the rest are largely interchangeable and instantly forgettable. Nothing memorable is said by anyone, and the script is third rate throughout. The best line in the whole damn movie is Jean Reno saying 'I thank you for this ignorant American one-sided version of World War Two'.Even the scene where they find the gold is a catastrophe: I don't want to give any spoilers, but if you stop to think about the breathtaking unlikelihood of how it is hit upon, in the middle of hundreds of miles of jungle, it should tell you a lot about the rest of the reasoning on display in the rest of this disaster.Lee has this amazing cast of black actors, who've all proven themselves unforgettable in other roles (with white filmmakers), and instead of allowing them to shine with complexity, nuance, wit and humour, he forces them to perform these dumbed-down stereotypes, fit for an 80s made-for-TV soap opera. Everything is so crass, unsubtle, haphazard and over-the-top.This film could have been amazing: a profound, insightful, surprising and spellbinding take on adventure movies with a similar theme, like Three Kings or The Man Who Would Be King or Treasure of the Sierra Madre, from an all-black perspective. But to even mention those masterpieces in the same sentence as this is an insult. It's as dumb as a bag of rocks. Please stop giving this man money to make bad B-movies.",3,138,300,12 June 2020
Mad Max: Fury Road," All The Depth, Plot and Character Development of a Pinball Machine
","Well, it took me all of 5 years to get round to seeing the bloody overpraised monstrosity, so I accept I might not be the target demographic, but even so: how anybody ever had the nerve to call Fury Road a great film is beyond me. It has all the depth, plot and character development of a pinball machine.It's not a TERRIBLE film, but it IS a very dull, empty and meaningless one, with no believable, likeable or even understandable characters in sight, and pretty much the entire cast, with the possible exception of Charlize Theron, is Australian soap opera level at best, and the bevy of supermodel brides some way below that. Tom Hardy's accent seems to roam across three continents for no discernible reason throughout, changing nationality from line to line and scene to scene on a whim. The dialogue is to all intents and purposes non-existent, certainly overwhelmingly unnecessary, consisting primarily of people pointing and screaming things like 'I'M GOING OVER THERE NOW!'Having said all that, and excusing the gaudy overabundance of CGI, I will say some of the action scenes are handled well, with a few good set-pieces and the occasional spot of successful tension-building thrown in. And maybe today that's all some people need.",4,3,7,21 April 2020
