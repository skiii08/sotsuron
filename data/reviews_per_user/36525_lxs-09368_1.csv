Blade Runner 2049," Real Proof Of Defeatism Of Sequels
","The film was boring, unrequested and way too long. Others have already correctly mention that.However, Blade Runner 2049 does something else. It destroys and voids much of what the original blade Runner explained, meant and achieved. Here is yet another forced sequel that mocks and ignores its prequel. Why does Hollywood not get some creativity? There are plenty of books out there it can work on for example.I do have to say that this crap is getting old fast and Harrison Ford needs to retire. Harrison, go spend your millions...Ridley, you are rich. Stop milking 30-year old films.",3,3,5,10 January 2018
