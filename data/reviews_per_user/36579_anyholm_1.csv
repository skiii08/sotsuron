Minority Report," Unique...
","Just saw the movie... not for the last time, thats for sure. Gave it a perfect 10, as I went through the whole emotional spectrum, watching the movie. Intense sadness, extreme suspense, happiness.... I even looked away for a few seconds (and that is not something i normally do)Tom Cruise is not one of my all-time favorites when it come to less actionpacked movies (where he does a great job) but he's perfect in the role of Detective John Anderton 'looking for answers'. Colin Farrell, Von Sydow, Jessica Capshaw and Stormare play sublime too.It is difficult to tell you anything about the plot, without giving away some of the thrill watching the game - so my best advice is for you to stop reading, and start finding a cinema :) Enjoy...PS And i just love when a movie like that, end like that...",10,0,0,4 August 2002
