First Man," Long, quiet and solemn, this film tries to look inwards, only to find dullness
","First man is the story of Neil Armstrong and the events leading up to the moon landing.
Niel is portrayed as a rather silent type, and whole swathes of the film are devoid of dialogue or even any real actions, in an attempt to portray solemnity and introspection. These long arduous swathes of quiet life are routinely interrupted by realities of Neil's position in the forefront of the space race, operating in a dangerous, high octane and pioneering world of space exploration.
The juxtaposing effect of switching between dull solemn slow moments in life and the high risk extreme moments of the space program is a nice idea, but it's a trick that runs out of steam the first time it is used, and certainly doesn't hold up for an entire movie where it is used again and again.
What you're left with is an incredibly long movie, with huge swathes of boredom and inactivity. The dialogue is almost non existent, and most of the characters flat and devoid of interest, most of all- the character of Neil Armstrong which is portrayed as a joyless dull man.
Maybe if this movie was a full hour shorter it could had been good. The current edit, for me, was agonizingly dull.If the subject matter interests you enough, or if you're into slow brooding introspective movies- as long as you know what you're getting you self into, you could give this movie a go. Alternatively, if you're having trouble sleeping- here is your chance at a good nights sleep.",5,3,6,16 December 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Mediocre and unmemorable high paced action
","The latest installment in the Star Wars saga has big shoes to fill, and maybe this responsibility is what ultimately made it so bland. The script which was ultimately so unoriginal, that lacked courage and artistic risks, and instead replaced them with incredibly complicated but meaningless story lines (bring along a genealogy expert to this film if you ever hope to make sense of the relations between all the characters), and with high paced endless action sequences more reminiscent of a Fast and Furious movie.
The characters, which in previous movies had individualism, are now completely nondescript, and physical appreaence aside, would be hard to tell apart or remember.
The film is also about an hour too long, making the action tedious rather then exciting just because of sheer screen time.
The film does deliver technically, and action sequences and effects are all done to the highest standard, with a couple of scenes standing out, though again, with no artistic ingenuity or ground breaking ideas, it's just more of the same (but done well).So should you see it? I would recommend it if you manage expectations. This is a generic big budget franchise action movie. It contains many of the beloved themes and settings from a world you might love. It treats them well enough. It just doesn't deliver anything new or exciting or insightful, unlike the original trilogy. Knowing this, you can enjoy the movie for what it is: unmemorable action.",6,3,5,31 December 2019
