Ford v Ferrari," Lead actor could not spoil a great film!
","Christian Bale was useless at playing a Englishman - Americans just can't do English accents - they must have all gone to the Dick Van Dyke acting school!!
Why did they not cast an English actor to play the part of a Englishman? Despite this the film held together well and was very enjoyable.",5,0,6,13 January 2020
