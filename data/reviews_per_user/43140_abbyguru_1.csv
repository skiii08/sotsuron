Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," It a great movie!
","No Spoilers! No, it isn't the most spectacular movie ever made, and it's not even the best Pirates of the Caribbean. On Stranger Tides just a good movie to watch and enjoy Captain Jack Sparrow's daring antics and tongue-in-cheek humor. If you are one of those harden intellectuals who considers a movie bad if it wasn't as good as the Dark Knight or some other Christopher Nolan film, then of course you won't like it. Truth be told, I never liked the fact that they ended the series with Pirates 3. It ended sad, unlike Curse of the Black Pearl's romantic, swashbuckling final scene. Pirates 4 brought back that 'Pirates' ending that the 3rd lacked! As for plot, not as good as the previous movies, but definitely enjoyable. Also, as for it being a series that Disney is using to bring in loads of money, Pirates 4 would have been even bigger and more bloated than Pirates 3 was, and it certainly wasn't! As long as Captain Jack Sparrow sails the seas, I will be there in a dark movie theater to watch his adventures every single time.",7,0,1,25 April 2012
