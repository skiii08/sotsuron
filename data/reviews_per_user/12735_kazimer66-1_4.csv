Sucker Punch," Live Action Anime Film
","Sucker Punch = anime fan's wet dream! The best sentence to describe this film - 'Live Action Anime!' All the fight choreography and the poses were ripped right out of Japanese anime. I'm not sure if Snyder or Shibuya are anime fans, but the film definitely had that vibe. Which leads me to believe that this film will do well in the overseas Asian markets where anime is far more prolific in the market.Visually amazing of course, Snyder never fails to deliver the visuals, however the story was a bit disjointed at points. It is very unfortunate that the foreshadowing very early on essentially offered up the end of the film. The audience should be allowed to discover it on their own. Perhaps a lack of objectivity by one who co-authored the script? Blue Jones came across as a weak antagonist, even when he got mean I didn't find it really believable. Maybe it was because there was a problem nailing down what the antagonist was? Blue or the short time Baby Doll had to escape. Some focus on this aspect would have helped to drill the story down to it's essential parts.The whole step-father aspect seemed to be some sort of MacGuffin or a loose thread left dangling, I couldn't really tell since it was abandoned early on without explanation or clear reason. This happened a few more times during the movie.If each of the girls were a splinter of Baby Doll's mind, then where does Sweet Pea fit in since she is supposed to be real? If they were not, then why wasn't that made clear? We see the girls in the asylum early on, and then the story focuses exclusively on what appears to be Baby Doll's 'fantasy world'- what happened to the asylum? 'Inception' this is NOT folks! Many aspects were introduced in this film and then never really revisited. The asylum, the step father, the other patients, it became initially puzzling, which then turned to annoying... Ambiguity as a gimmick is really sloppy story telling, IMHO. To revisit the asylum and the parallel events (we suspect) is to reinforce the idea of Baby Doll's fantasy or psychosis, which would have helped the film round out the story.The segway into the various 'missions' was rather smart and the anachronistic touches were clever, however after the second one, they began to appear rather generic as they didn't appear to have any discernible theme outside of different war eras.Scott Glen as the wise man throughout didn't work for me. It stretched my suspension of disbelief too far to see an American as the wise man in Japan (even if this was an American girl's fantasy). The first sequence should have had a Japanese actor like Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa playing the wise man and for each segment a different appropriate wise man would appear with a common iconic catch phrase or article of clothing that would make Baby Doll recognize him. Perhaps a Frenchman for the second like Jean Reno, a Brit for the third, like Daniel Craig and finally Glenn for the last. That would lend sense of period focus to each war era mission.I found the Action sequences were merely there-visually stunning to be sure, but not very thematic as far as I could tell. I hoped they would become progressively more challenging and difficult to complete, but they didn't go there. They were action vignettes for the sake of action, not so much to progress the story along in any meaningful way.For the record, as a frequent movie goer I am really getting tired of the shaky hand-cam shots in recent films lately! NEWS FLASH to DIRECTORS! : Shaky cameras don't give the audience sense of frenetic action. It only serves to confuse the visuals and annoy the viewer. Take a cue from Stanley Kubrick's work on 'Full Metal Jacket' and master action shots with the damn steady cam! Ultimately what 'Sucker Punch' lacks is a heart, a soul to draw people into the plight of Baby Doll. That never happened. Perhaps it was the weak antagonist or the various dangling story threads abandoned to allow more screen time for extended fantasy sequences with the 'wow' factor.The real life peril Baby Doll was in, was a dramatic story unto itself and it never seemed to be fully exploited, which was unfortunate.All in all, Sucker Punch is a fairly descent anime styled film, with several shortcomings. Those who love pure eye candy action will love it, others who are more discerning or require a strong narrative may not care so much.The smartest thing the studio did for this movie is to go for the PG-13 film rating. Adolescents will certainly appreciate all the flash of the 'Goth Girls with Guns' action. A more sophisticated crowd might quickly pass on the picture.I saw a lot of potential, that was never realized. Maybe Mr.Snyder should stick to making films he DIDN'T write...I wish more producers would at least have enough business acumen to send a director's script to a screenwriter for the final pass.Too often a film maker shooting their own words lacks the necessary objectivity to cut or change the film so that it works.",7,5,9,25 March 2011
Star Trek," Enjoyed the Reboot except
","Loved Mr.Abrams new vision and how he integrated it with the existing franchise.Biggest complaint was the Kobyashi Maru scene where Kirk was strutting around beating the program. Very much an out of character moment in my opinion. The scene could have played better had Kirk taken the simulation very seriously and upon his success we saw Spock and the observers shocked and puzzled as to how he managed to win. Then the controversy and investigation after the fact would have more resonance to the viewer.Kirk would not give away that he cheated the simulation but also wouldn't deny he did it when confronted. That to me, seemed more like the Kirk style rather than the strut he had during it. He's a cocky character, but not stupid! The only other complaint was yet ANOTHER revenge story as the point of conflict for this Trek film. It's been done too many times before and let's face it Nicholas Meyer did the definitive Star Trek revenge film back in 1982! Something fresh next time please!",9,1,4,11 September 2009
Footloose," When it was good it was very very good, when it was bad...
","The producers hoped they would give Wormald his 'Bacon' break, but unlike Bacon who was a good actor who surprised everyone with his dancing, Warmald is a good dancer who really isn't a very good actor. However, this film could easily become the breakout roles for Julianne Hough and Miles Teller. Julianne Hough often carried the film when her costar couldn't.The film is a respectful update to the 84 classic, often stealing scenes and dialogue verbatim from the 1984 script. Normally I am critical of such 'lazy' writing, but with this film, I couldn't think of anything better to replace them with. So it's forgivable.The film did bog down frequently at the worst times. The key to the 84 film's success was the 'economy of words'. Nothing was explained if it could be showed and nothing was shown if it was already explained.In this film the initial accident was fine, but then became redundant when the reason for the dance laws were later explained to Ren. It is a basic 'either / or' choice for the story. Bogging the story down with over explained or over dramatized scenes don't help. The purpose of the destruction in Ren's private dance was lost on me.. The idea was to get out his anger in a creative way, not to trash a warehouse! Why the fight outside the dance was extended was beyond me completely. It was never meant to be a pivotal scene, just a short resolution to the Chuck conflict, a blip to amp up the excitement to the final dance sequence.Many things about this remake /update worked and others fell completely flat.As I said initially, this film showcased that Julianne Hough has real acting chops, something even I was skeptical about going in. The real break out from this film will be her not Kenny Wormald. I believe she and Miles Teller will get a lot of work from this film.",Null,1,6,14 October 2011
Fantastic Four," Too Many Bad Guys!
","First the beefs: 1. The producer needs to consider that some blondes have brown eyes (was I the only one creeped out by the blue contacts on Jessica's eyes?). 2. Jessica Alba does not have the face to pull off long blonde hair. It looked like straw and fake, the first film did a better job with her makeup. 3. With a character like the Silver Surfer why oh why bring back Von Doom? His presence made the plot all too predictable and wasted a perfectly good mysterious nemesis for the team to puzzle out before the world was 'eaten'. A different angle on the script and the loss of a predictable character would have levitated this film from 'good' to 'great'! 4. As already stated, suffered from Batman syndrome or maybe a more modern phrase, Spiderman 3 syndrome, too many villains distracting from the core of the story, 'who is the Silver Surfer, why is he here and how do we stop this world ending event?' 5. Considering Galactus created the silver surfer it seems a bit of a stretch that the surfer would have sufficient power to destroy his master. It would have worked better had he 'convinced' Galactus to move on to another world. Could have had created some dramatic tension at the climax. 6. The whole 'oh my God we are alive hug' at the end came across as forced and unbelievable. Maybe it was a pacing thing or the actors just didn't convey why they waited to embrace each other, I am not quite sure. It came across as contrived and unnatural. 7. They may wish to spend more time / money on Mr. Fantastic's stretching. It still suffers from a lack of believability, especially on the dance floor when is civilian clothes stretched with his arms and legs...Bouquets:1. The playful banter between the team was excellent, you really got the sense that they were family. 2. The surfer was brilliantly done! No wasted money on that sfx. 3. The obvious product placements were fun and reminiscent of Captain Amazing from Mystery Men. Lots of fun. 4.SPFX were very good for what they cost, just enough to be believable, but not so much that their costs required superfluous screen time to justify them. 5. Galactus was nicely interpreted for the screen, the comic book appearance of the character would have been too hokey, however I was disappointed that this 'entity' had no semblance of an anthropomorphic qualities at it's core, like a face. 6. The performances of the heroes was excellent and felt very true to their characters, the use of Fishburnes voice as the surfer was well done and added a nice aspect to the alien nature of the character.Overall a better film than the first one, even with its warts. Had von doom not been brought back and the team was forced to learn about the surfer through several encounters I believe the story could have been more compelling to the audience. It would also allow us to become more connected to the heroes and care about the peril they would find themselves in. I really didn't get a strong sense that any of the team were in mortal danger or the planet, so in that respect it failed to deliver. However, I think that may have been because I was anticipating the clichéd ulterior motives and betrayal of Doom and the screen time devoted to this part of the plot, instead of learning about the surfer along with the characters in the film.It was a good second effort, however I believe if the producers actually took an existing comic book script and adapted it or employed a writer who understands the material better, the stories will become better thus making for a more profitable film.",7,1,2,17 June 2007
