Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It is an alright film
","This movie was Okay. It was just that Jar Jar was really annoying. I could go on forever. Well, lets talk about the good parts. The Good: #1.A great villain. #2.It was interesting to see Anakin's past, I enjoyed seeing his childhood. #3. Liam Neeson did a good job of acting as Qui Gon Jinn. #4. It was interesting to see what happened before parts 4, 5, and 6. The Bad: #1. Jar Jar is the worst character in this movie. He is annoying. #2. Jake Lloyd does not do the best of acting as Anakin. #3. Horrible dialogue. #4. I want Yoda as a puppet, Not CGI. Overall: It's OK, this my least favorite of the 6 films. If you have not seen it and you are expecting it to blow your mind away like Episodes 4, 5, and 6 did, then you will be very disappointed. My overall rating is 6 out of 10 stars. Enjoy.",4,0,1,8 June 2008
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The one that started it all.
","Best Indy flick. My 7th favorite movie ever. I love this movieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Du du da da du da da du du du da du du da da da du da du da du da du da du. Great movie. Steven Spielberg's best. Indiana Jones and The Raiders of the lost ark is the best of the series. I have yet to see the new one but once I see it I will review it. Raiders is a greaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat film. It is a film that most people have seen. It has a very big cult following. I am a fan of the series and I think Raiders Of the Lost Ark is the best of the series. It is a fact. If you hate these movies, then I will try to track you down and have a whip with me and whip you(just kidding, we all have different tastes). This is a great film. It's beginning is infamous. What more? Harrison Ford is perfect for his role. All I have to say.",10,0,0,22 May 2008
Wayne's World," Sucked. Not.
","Very, very funny movie. I love this movie. Very funny. Probably Mike Myers best film. Your probably asking What about International Man of Mystery(The first Austin Powers movie)? Well, I have yet to see it. Back to my review. Wayne's World is hilarious. I am a big fan of the Bill & Ted pictures so I enjoyed this. This movie is about 2 guys in there 20s(I think there in there 20s) named Wayne and Garth. They have there own TV show called Wayne's World. I will not give anything else away. Wayne's World is based on a popular SNL sketch. If you liked Bill and Ted 1 and 2 then you will love this. My overall rating is 8 out of 10 stars. Enjoy. Thank you.",8,1,4,8 June 2008
Spider-Man 2," Better then the original
","This one of those sequels that surpasses the first one. A great blockbuster. A great second installment to the series. A great superhero film. There are some similarities to this and Superman II. If you have seen both, then you should know what I am talking about. If you liked the first one, then you will love this. A great second Part. I highly recommend this film. I love all 3 films. I loved this film. One of the best superhero films out there. If you are a DVD collector(Like me) then you should add this to your collection. It is that good. The acting is good. It has some humor. It has action and romance so Males and females will enjoy it. My overall rating for Spider-Man 2 is 8 out of 10 spiders. Enjoy. Thank you. Great film.",8,3,3,14 June 2008
Spider-Man 3," Best of the trilogy, in my opinion
","Okay, I have noticed a lot of comments that are negative. I just felt like making a comment for this one. Well, I really enjoyed this. I found this to be the most fun of the series, some of you were complaining that there was not enough action, uh, hello, this had 10 times more action then the first 2 films, and you are saying that it needs more action? Well, now I will talk about the good. The good:1.It is fun to watch. 2.It surpasses Parts 1 and 2 in my opinion. 3.It has venom in it. 4.Venom looks great. 5. The action is great. 6.Sandman, to my eyes looks similar to what he did in the comic books. 7.I like spidey's black costume. 8.It has an interesting premise. 9.It is dark. 10.It is good to watch when you are bored. The Bad: 1.There are some cheesy scenes and if you have scene the movie, then you probably know what I am talking about. 2.The dialogue is not that good but hey, it is a Spider-Man movie, not a Shakespeare play. 3.Not enough of Venom. I wish they could have made it a bit longer to show more of venom because Venom is my favorite Spider-Man villain. 4.The acting is not as good as the acting in the first 2 films, but hey, at least some of the acting is alright. 5. Even though I liked the black Spider-Man suit, it does not look like the way it did in the comics. Well, now I will talk about the reason why this movie is not for everyone. There are some scenes that are silly. Some people say that it has to many villains. To those people who said that, did you guys ever see Batman The Movie(No, no, no, not the 1989 film, the 1966 film based on the TV series) It had 4 villains, was it cheesy, yes, but enjoyable. I thought this movie was like a comic book on the big screen(yes, I know I stole that from the angry video game nerd). I know that some of you are going to say to me your stupid but, keep in mind we all have different taste. If you listened to the reviews, then I say go rent it, you might think it is the best of the series, you might think it is the worst of the series. I thought this one was the best one yet. So my overall rating for Spider-Man 3 is 8 out of 10 stars. Enjoy the ride. Thank you. Well that was probably the longest review I have ever written so far.",3,1,2,17 June 2008
The Terminator," 2nd best Terminator movie
","The only Terminator movie that is better then this is Terminator 2:Judgement Day. This is more of a action movie then Part 2. It is almost a Horror film. It is a Action/ Sci-Fi/Thriller/Romance. It is my sixth favorite film ever. It is my third favorite time travel flick. Anyone who has never heard of this movie probably has never heard of a lot of movies. If you have not seen it, then I definitely recommend it to you. One guy on here who did not like this film was saying that the terminator does not have any emotions. Of course, he doesn't, He is a cyborg. He cannot have emotions and he also said that the chase scenes were frustrating because the terminator never gets tired. Well, He is programmed to not get tired so he won't stop ever until you are dead. That guy who posted that comment is an idiot. He is the worst critic on here ever. Well, this film is a masterpiece. A great piece from the 80s. I am a big fan of the 80s so I loved this film. MPAA rating:R. Ages 10 and up. Great film because it is very original. It does not rely too much on special effects. Some of the special effects are horrible but who cares? The movie is very realistic.",10,0,1,21 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," 3rd best Star wars movie.
","I used to think that Revenge of the Sith was my 3rd favorite SW film but now I think that Episode III is my 4th favorite of the 6 films. Return of the Jedi is a great film, Not as good as New hope or Empire but It is still good. One thing I do not like about it is the ewoks. But the ewoks are better then Jar Jar. If you liked the first 2(of the original trilogy) then you should like this. It has a good light saber duel. So it is a great film. Well, Jar Jar was not in this, thank God. So this is a good film. It is good for the family. So I liked it. So, my overall rating is 8 out of 10 stars. Great film. Awesome. Enjoy the ride. Thank you.",8,0,1,1 June 2008
Rocky II," Rocky Part II
","After the extremely successful original, a sequel was inevitable. So, Stallone wrote the script and viola, a sequel. The sequel picks up immediately where Part 1 left off. So that is why I am referring the sequel as Rocky Part II. After Rocky went the distance with Apollo, Even though Apollo won, Apollo wants a rematch, even though he said ain't gonna be no rematch. This is the one with the most comedy in the Rocky series. Like the scene where Rocky is driving the car. That scene was funny because Rocky clearly does not have a drivers license. It is not as good as Part I but that does not mean it is bad. If you liked Part I, You should like this. It has a great training scene. This time we get 2 training scenes. I could totally tell that this was intended to be the last one but it did well at the box office so they had to make more. So this is a good film. It had a good ending. But it is nowhere near as good as Rocky Part I.",8,2,2,25 May 2008
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Terminator 3:Rise of the Crap.
","Crap. Just crap. Terrible dialogue. The first 2 were great but this is just a big piece of crap that is only fit for idiots that are fans of Battlefield Earth and people that think that every sequel is better then the previous installment. The Termanatrix sucks. The T-1000 is a better Terminator then that one. The TX is played by a frigging female. Terrible performances except for Arnold's. But that does not stop it from being the worst in the trilogy. Sarah Conner is dead. I think that Jonathon Mostow should be ashamed of himself for ruining(for give me) the series. If you have only seen the first 2 and you think you have seen it all then your right. You have. This one is so skipabble that I think that the movie thinks that the extreme dumbness of the movie is amusing. If you have not seen any of the Terminator movies then watch Part 1 and Part 2. Skip Part 3. I do not recommend you on buying this film. I do not recommend you renting this film. I do not recommend you on watching this film. In my opinion, the series is still 2 movies. I enjoy to pretend that this film was never made. It should have never been made. The 2nd worse time travel movie, next to Time Chasers. Avoid this piece of crap at all costs. Terminator 2 should have been the last one. Personally, I would like to send a Terminator back in time to stop this movie from being made. That is how bad this movie was. Just stay away. If you think that all sequels are better then one before, then this is for you. otherwise, just stay away. 3 out of 10 stars. Another CGI piece of bullcrap. If you have only seen the first 2 then you have seen it all. Do not watch this. I am doing you a favor. Please do not watch this. Thank you.",3,2,5,25 May 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Best Terminator movie ever.
","I am a 11 year old fan of the first 2 Terminator films(I hated T3). Even though these films are Rated R, I am allowed to watch these films(One of the few R rated film series I am allowed to watch). It is a fact that is this is the best of the series. And I agree with that fact. Terminator 2 is the second best time travel movie. The only time travel movie that is better then this is Back To The Future. This is also the second best sequel. The only sequel that is better then this is THe Empire Strikes Back. This is better then Terminator 1. Yep you heard me. This is better then the original and thats a fact. It has some humor. It is not as violent as the first one. It is more of a Sci-Fi picture then the first one mainly because of the T-1000. This is my 5th favorite film ever. John Connor is a cool 10 year old kid in this film. Arnold Schwarzenegger's best picture. MPAA Rating:R. My MPAA Rating:PG-13. I love this film because of it's plot, it's humor, and Arnold. Some people on the internet bash this film because of Eddie Furlong. He is not annoying. Great movie.",10,6,8,21 May 2008
Spider-Man," One of the best superhero films ever
","I enjoyed this. If you liked the first Superman film, you will love this. I think that it is better then Superman, but Superman is still good. If you are a fan of the spider-man comic books, then you will like this. I believe that any true fan of the comics would enjoy this film. I have read some Spidey comics and liked them. If you have not seen this, then go to your local video rental store and rent it. If you like it, then buy it. I remember the day I first saw it in the theater. I was 5. I loved it. So did my mom. We bought it on DVD when the DVD came out. I still love it to this day. I have seen all 3 in the movie theater and own all 3 of them on DVD. So my overall rating for Spider-Man 1 is 8 out of 10 spiders. Enjoy. Thank you.",8,2,4,6 June 2008
Back to the Future Part III," Back To The Future Part III
",Marty is now stranded in 1955. But with the help of Doc he finds the delorean in a cave or whatever but uh-oh since Doc was sent back in time to 1885 on accident he got killed there. So Marty has to go back in time to stop him from being shot By Mad Dog I mean Buford Tannen and go Back to the Future. Back To The Future Part 3 is not as good as the first 2 but is still a good film. I liked the old west part because I love westerns. Back 3 is not as good as Back 1 and 2 but it is still a fun movie. It is a good ending to the series. So this is a Final chapter to the series. BTTF 3 is a good film. If you liked Part 1 and Part 2 then you should like this. So my overall rating is 7 out of 10 stars. I recommend this film. Enjoy the ride. Thank you.,8,0,0,26 May 2008
Patton," As Patton would say, ' This is one H*ll of a War film'
","Out of all the WW2 films that I have seen, this is my personal favorite WW2 film. Also my favorite war film. It is very well written. George C.Scott's performance as General George Patton is great, wonderful. If you have not seen this, then you are missing out on one of the greatest performances of all time. It shows the military career of General Patton during World War II(The Great World War II, as he would call it) in battle such as North Africa, Sicily, Normandy, and Battle of the Bulge. George C.Scott's Performance as Patton is so great, you actually believe he really is Patton. George Scott had a growly voice, but in reality, General George Patton had a fairly high pitched southern accent. This film is definitely in my top 50 favorite films. If you are a WW2 buff or History Buff, or a fan of George C.Scott, then you will love this movie. The music is great. The acting is great. The ending is great. I give Patton an 8 out of 10 and a 5 out of 5, Best War film ever.",8,2,4,25 May 2009
The Dark Knight," Masterpiece
","A brilliant superhero film. Heath Ledger did a great job. A flawless film. Even better then Iron Man. I saw this movie twice. First time I saw it was the day after it came out. Second time was on August 29, 2008, This film is great. 5 out of 5 stars. If you haven't seen it, the stop reading this review, then go see it. I promise that you will love it. The Best Batman movie ever. Should win Best picture. Don't take anybody under the age of 8 or 9 because it could scare them. I will be buying it when it comes out on DVD. 8 out of 10. A+. This film is better the Batman Begins. If you liked Batman Begins, then you will love this. The ending was great. I think the Joker should be in the next one but I do not think that that person can beat Mr.Ledger. RIP Heath Ledger. Go see it now.",9,4,11,7 September 2008
The Fly," Best Remake ever.
","Better then the Original. This is not only a masterpiece but also the grossest movie I have ever seen. This is a must see for any gore fan. I am not a huge fan of gore but gore never bothers me. If you are expecting a scary movie you will be disappointed because this movie is not scary it is just gory. It has very little in common with the original version so don't expect it to be exactly like the original. In this one the change every single character's name(there are some characters that are not in this one). Instead of having a brother that Andre had in the original Seth does not(not that I know of). This movie is a very interesting one. The fly and Seth do not switch body parts instead they switch DNA. This film is kinda a love story. It does have originality and is more of a Sci-fi flick then the original. I usually hate remakes but this one is a masterpiece in my opinion. While watching this you could easily forget that this is a Remake because it is a retelling. It is gory. Very Gory. It has great dialogue Like Your afraid to be destroyed, recreated aren't you? and Be afraid, Be very afraid(The most famous line from the film and the best). If you get motion sickness from these types of movies then do not view this film. This is not a movie for everybody. But I had fun watching this and it is a masterpiece in my opinion. 8 out of 10 stars. I highly recommend this film.",8,0,1,25 May 2008
Rocky," Rocky Part I
","Rocky is a great film about a club boxer who gets a chance to fight the heavyweight champion of the world. Well, I am a huge fan of boxing, so I enjoyed this. That is not all it is about though. If you want the entire movie to have boxing matches then you will be disappointed, Well that would get tiring because the movie would not have a plot. So I was not disappointed. Rocky Part I is a great film. This film is infamous. Since that most people have seen this, there are some people that haven't seen this. They need to see this. This is my 9th favorite film ever. Sylvester Stallone was in a few films before this. Starting out with that porno that he did. Rocky is a great film. Best film from 1976. Great film about a boxer. Everyone who has not seen this needs to see this. Rocky Part 1.",10,0,0,23 May 2008
Rocky III," Rocky III
","After Rocky beat Apollo in Rocky Part 2, 5 years has past, Rocky is a very popular person. He is still champ and Clubber Lang becomes the number 1 contender. Then Rocky fights Clubber and Rocky gets the crap beat out of him. Rocky is going to get a rematch but oh no, Mickey is dead now, because Clubber pushed Mickey right before the fight. Now who will train him now? Will Rocky win the rematch? watch to find out. Rocky III is not as good as Part 1 and Part 2 but it is still good. So I recommend it. If you liked Rocky Part 1 and 2 you should like this. Is it predictable? yeah, maybe a little. But hey, it is a Rocky movie. Not a Shakespeare play. Not the best of the series but hey, it is not the worst. It has a good rematch. The ending is good. And it is fun. so my overall rating is 7 out of 10 stars. Watch it if you have not seen it. Thank you. Good not great. Enjoy the match. Thank you.",8,0,0,28 May 2008
Jaws," Greatest horror film ever.
","This movie is awesome. My 8th favorite film ever. It is a scary movie. It is a little gory. Best shark attack movie(No I am not talking about the film series Shark attack). My favorite line is Smile you son of a. 2nd favorite is Your gonna need a bigger boat. This film is the first true summer blockbuster. Come on, Wiki it. I have not seen the sequels. Just this one. The ending where the shark blows up is a great ending. It has infamous music which makes this a infamous film. Some youths(like me) don't find this scary at all. well, there loss. I find this film scary. Watch it before you go swimming. I love this movie. It is awesome. All I have to say. Great movie. A masterpiece. it is hard not to like a masterpiece. True. Most people have seen this movie. Spielberg's second best. Mpaa rating:PG. My MPAA rating:PG-13. Great movie.",10,0,2,22 May 2008
Back to the Future Part II," Back To The Future Part II
","The only reason why I am having the spoilers is because some people have not seen Part I so I think that some People who have not seen Part I might be reading this right now. Now on to the review. Right after the ending of Back To The Future Part 1, It has Marty, Doc, and Jennifer go to the year 2015 to save there children, but uh oh, wait, Marty gets this sports Almanac then Old Biff steals it and give it to himself in 1955. Now Old Biff gets back then Marty and Doc get in the delorean without knowing that Biff was in it. Then they go Back to 1985. Now 1985 is a whole lot different. Now they have to go back in time to 1955 to steal the almanac from young Biff so they can safe the future and go back to the way it was. It is not as good as BTTF 1 but that does not mean it is bad. I can see why it has Part II in the title. It is not as good or as fun as Back 1 but it is still good fun. It does have some flaws but I think this film is fun. It has 2 story lines. It is almost as good but not as good Part 1. So Back 2 is a fun film. My overall rating is 7 out of 10 stars.MPAA Rating:PG. My MPAA Rating:PG-13.",8,0,1,26 May 2008
Iron Man," I hope this wins Best Picture
","A great film. Not as good as Spider-Man 2 and 3(I know that a lot of you are going to hate me because I mentioned Spider-Man 3 but I thought that Spider-Man 3 was the best so deal with it) but Better then Spider-Man 1. A great film. This is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, then go to the movie theater right now. You need to see this in the theater. Now I will name my top 12 superhero films. 1.The Mask. 2.Spider-Man 3. 3.Spider-Man 2. 4.Batman Begins. 5.Iron Man. 6.Spider-Man 1. 7.X Men 2. 8.X Men. 9.Superman.10.Batman . 11.The Incredible Hulk.12.The Incredibles.

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," The First(or fourth) Star Wars movie and the best
","Hello, I am a 11 year old fan of Star Wars and, having seen all 6 films, This is the best Star Wars movie, In my opinion. I think this my favorite SW flick because it was the first Star Wars picture I ever saw. So it will always have very, very, very special place in my heart. I first saw this film in 2002, when I was 5 years old. I will never forget that day as long as I live. This is my 2nd favorite film of all time. Anyone who has never seen this must watch this film right now. It has unforgettable characters like Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Darth Vader, and many more. Everything what a Sci-Fi film should be. It spawned countless spoofs, and flat out knock offs. 10 out of 10. Great movie. Almost everyone has seen this. If you have never heard of this, then where do you live, on a desert island? Because everyone has heard of this. I am so looking forward to Star Wars episode VII, VIII, and IX which will be released in the 2020s according to supershadow.com, I love this movie because I am a big fan of Sci-fi.",10,1,1,21 May 2008
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The 2nd best Star Wars movie
","It is a fact that this one is the best. But, I disagree with this fact. I think this is the second best. This is my 4th favorite movie. The only Star Wars movie that is better then this is Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope. In my opinion. But this is a great film. I love this film. This is the best sequel of all time. In my opinion. I think it is almost as good. I think that the only reason that you guys think this is the best is because Lucas did not direct. But this one has great dialogue, and some of the acting is better. It introduces a lot more of unforgettable characters like Yoda, and Lando, and the emperor. Yoda rocks. So does the emperor. and Lando. It is the darkest of all 6 films in my opinion and the most mature. So, It is a great movie and the greatest sequel ever. MPAA Rating:PG. My MPAA Rating:PG-13. I think this is even darker the Revenge of the Sith. It has some romance. A great lightsaber fight. and don't forget the infamous line. Darth:No, I am your father. I am pretty sure that everyone in the movie theater was shocked from that line. 9 out of 10 stars.",10,0,2,21 May 2008
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," 2nd Best Indy flick
","The only Indy flick that is better then this is Raiders. After the events of the first 2, well I have not watched this in a long time but I have seen this. I find it funny that it is titled The Last Crusade because it is not the last crusade. Sean Connery is in this, I think that is cool because I like James Bond movies. Connery plays Indy's father. Good acting, and a good script. This is the first Indiana Jones film to be rated PG-13. I do recall some bits. So, If you liked the first 2, then you should like this, If you did not then there is no talking to you. So this is a great film in my opinion. If you have not seen any of the 4 movies then buy or rent the first 3 then go see the 4th one in your local movie theater. So my overall rating is 8 out of 10 stars. Enjoy the ride. Have fun. Thank you.",8,1,2,1 June 2008
