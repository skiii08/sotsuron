Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hey, it's Star Wars
","I enjoyed this film.Let's be honest with each other, when it comes to plot and acting, the first three movies didn't exactly blow you away. Star Wars was basically a sphagett western wrapped up tight in a sci-fi tortilla shell. Nobody knew who the actors were in the original Star Wars. Any science fiction reader who'd cut his or her teeth with the likes of Heinlein, Poul Anderson or Frederick Pohl would have recognized the much over-used plot. Harrison Ford's acting was so-so (especially in Return/Jedi) and everybody cringed when Chewbacca did his infamous Tarzan yelp as he and two Ewoks make a beeline for an AtAt Walker.What I'm getting at, folks, is that plot, dialogue and acting were never highly regarded in any of the three films. What placed it in the hearts and minds of many throughout the world as the best movie ever made was its fantastic special effects.How does the Phantom Menace differ? It's plot is lacking, dialogue terrible, and acting just so-so? What's the big deal? Who cares! But what special effects -- oh that pop race! Oh the Darth Maul death scene! Oh the 'New York City' planet of Corsusant!C'mon, THOSE were sights and sounds we were hoping for, and received. Star Wars isn't 'Chariots of Fire.' It isn't 'Out of Africa!' It's Star Wars! It's samauri drawing steel; cowboys facing off in the downtown square; a Texas Ranger leaping to safety as the wagon scoots over the cliff; the screaming damsel saved untied from the railroad tracks by the hero at the last possible moment!And imagine the task Lucas faced: Fans wanted the new movie to BE like Star Wars, but to be DIFFERENT, as well. They wanted the humor but new plot ideas. They wanted new characters but old ones had better be there, too. With this type of hype from Star Wars fans (almost as bad as Star Trek fans) Lucas was doomed to failure even before he shot his first frame of film.The movie was pure enjoyment. Pure adrenaline. No other sci-fi movie has been examined, then torn apart on basis of plot and dialogue. Why begin with this movie?It met the one true requirements of a Star Wars movie: it was fun. Leave it at that, sit back, and enjoy.A thumb's up, always.",Null,0,0,5 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Please people... get off the high horse.
","The only thing that makes me laugh longer than bad movies are people who take summer popcorn movies waaaaaaay too seriously. And reading many of the comments from posters who say they were 'bored' or 'almost fell asleep' or 'was just as bad as Phantom', these poor unfortunate souls walked into the movie theater thinking the screening was going to be a boardroom meeting instead of a form of entertainment. Let me be the first to tell you, this movie is 'fun.' Pure fun. Isn't that, ultimately, what movies are supposed to be? Fun? Which is what Star Wars is supposed to be. You see, somewhere, in a galaxy far, far away, idiotic fans 'Star Trekked' George Lucas' masterpiece, turning Star Wars from a movie into a religion. And in doing so, many 'fans' took 'Phantom' and now this newest movie way way way too seriously, forgetting the one aspect that made the original triology work so well in the first place - having fun.Yeah, the dialogue is terrible (and he had a professional writer help him this time - one day he will learn that he's a brilliant producer, an OK director, but he should never pick up the pen ever again). The one-liners reminded me Arnie, and caused me roll my eyes. But my criticisms ended there. The movie is FUN! It had me laughing. The love story actually, in some small way, touched me. The battle at the end of the movie in the desert was much more sophisticated than that haphazard collection of cut-scenese from Phantom. The acting was very good, and there were many soothing 'references' to previous (or future) movies, something that Phantom lacked.This is a very fun movie, and I will happily see it again. No, it's not Shakespeare. But if you're expecting Star Wars to be Shakepeare, you've got much bigger problems than the Jedi currently face from the Sith Lords.Go, enjoy, and for God's sakes... HAVE FUN!!",Null,0,0,17 May 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Wow!
","I think it's appropriate that the third and final Matrix installment has occurred under the current Bush administration, because both the current political state and the entire Matrix concept is about freedoms from oppression. Had this movie been made pre-2000, most people would have felt the movie was made about the Clinton years, where Big Brother told you what to do and not what to do, what you could have and couldn't have - sounds a lot like the robot mechanisms fighting humanity, eh? I turned to my friend and told him this and he nodded thoughtfully. It's amazing just how brutal a socialistic liberal society can be - thank goodness we only get to see the outcome of such a world on celluloid, and thankfully don't have to worry about it now - at least not until the pendumlum, unfortunately, swings back to the left.8-of-10",Null,0,0,9 November 2003

The Patriot," A good summer flick
","Boy, what ever happened to the days when a person went to the movie theater to watch and enjoy a movie? People who have been offended by this movie probably shouldn't pay their money to see any type of movie of any kind at all, because if you're that sensative, then you will find faults with ever movie, no matter the genre.I'm not a big fan of Emmerich but the Patriot was much better than I'd anticipated, especially considering his two previous movies -- Godzilla and ID4. It's a rousing movie made to stir up the emotions during this country's birthday, and it's message is clear -- be proud that you're an American, and look and see just how close we came to being ruled under God, King and Country.No thanks.To the people who were horrified at the depiction of this movie, what's the big deal? It's a MOVIE... you know, fiction? If you want accurate history, sit down in front of the the History Channel or TLC. If you want an emotional, patriotic movie, pay your dollars for the Patriot. And how do we know the British didn't do the things we saw on the Silver Screen? I doubt anybody today was alive back then... the British Empire -- like the Romans before it -- was the lone superpower in the world. You don't think they would resort to brutality to keep their lowly subjects in line?!? Give me a break!Remember guys, America is today's only true superpower... and last I saw, we were the only ones to drop an Atomic bomb on a populated city.So, please, stop with the mock outrage and generalizations and just go and enjoy a good summer flick!",Null,0,0,13 July 2000
Pearl Harbor," Good summer flick
","I liked this film.I also like reading about history. But I don't have to pay $8 to go to the local library and check out a book on Pearl Harbor and spend the next 2 weeks reading about it. It's for free. But it's also rather boring, too. Most historical books - hell, history itself - is boring.
So I go to see films and see fiction interwoven into the fabric of reality - which of course is what the 2001 'Pearl Harbor' is.Hey, this movie is Hollywoodized - don't kid yourself. Facts about this raid are 'dumbed' down for the overwight, hot-dog eating American audience. But who cares, right? If you want to read or see about what *really* happened in 1941, rent 'Tora Tora Tora' in all of its bland, black-and-white boringness.But if you want to go see a rip-roaring 'fun' movie - leave behind your history book and just have fun. Let me repeat myself.'Just. Have. Fun!'There is a love story. Something about two guys chasing after the same woman. One of the men goes to Hawaii. The other to Britain to help our cousins stave off those dastardly Nazis. One of the two gets shot down, he's believe to be dead, yadda yadda yadda, something something, they do it in some hanging parachutes and then... the 'real' reason we paid what we did to see this flick: the attack.You know, you gotta tip your hat to the Japanese military when you realize the sheer scope of the attack (hundreds of planes - broken up between high-altitude bombers, fighters and torpedo planes) and the damage they wrought (2,000-plus dead and more than a dozen ships hit in less than 2 hours).The entire attack - more than 30 minutes long but it seems like 10 minutes - is amazing. A few critics said the fx was worse than those seen on Titanic - I disagree. The aerial combat was breathtaking. The bombing and raking of Americans in the water was done extremely well. I found myself ducking from the bullets spat from the diving Zeros, much like I did during the opening of 'Saving Private Ryan.' And some of my favorite war footage didn't occur over the skies of Hawaii, but rather over Britain, when British and the American 'Eagle Squadron' jumped from lumbering Nazi bombers near the British coast. Great footage - puts anything seen in 'Memphis Belle' to shame in a hurry.OK, there were some cheesy points: two American fighters manage - ala Star Wars - to out-fly, out-gun and out-fx 7 Japanese Zeros, which of course was great to watch but totally bogus in real life. Sorry, when the odds in aerial combat are 3-1, the 1 will lose everytime. But that scene was balanced with Cuba Gooding's shootdown from the deck of a stricken ship of a diving torpedo bomber - great effects.Once the battle is completed, there is somewhat of a letdown, and it seems too long of a pause from when the bombs finish dropping over Oahu and when Doolittle's bombers drop American bombs on Tokyo. Still, this raid has seldom been touched by Hollywood, and it was refreshing to see.My favorite scenes from the whole movie were, of course, the ones shown on the previews months ago - tiny snippets of Americana throughout the Hawaiian Islands rudely brought up cold by these menacing - and yet beautiful - Japanese planes. A woman with wet clothes from a clothesline; boy scouts on a tromp through the hills; a baseball game. Beautiful, mesmerizing, and yes, menacing.My only regret - and something I was anticipated and was disappointed when it didn't occur - is that Bay failed to show snippes of Japanese everyday life in and around Tokyo suddenly ground to a halt as the B-25's roared overhead. There was one scene of several Japanese women looking up and running, as the bombers - getting kissed by ak-ak fire and smoke - can be seen in the corner of the screen at the top of a hill.Regardless, this is a great summer movie that *will* entertain you. C'mon folks - that's all movies can do. Not teach our kids history. They get school for that. And it's not to tell how things happened back then. The History Channel and our grandfathers are for that. This movie tells a good story. That' what you get for your $8 bucks.Enjoy it.",Null,0,0,28 May 2001
Saving Private Ryan," Tears...
","Tears...It's all I have to say. Tears. Real tears. Salty tears. Splashed across the cheeks of the majority of the men -- both young and old -- sitting numbly in the theater.Men weeping. What a strange experience and concept. What a strange sight to see. But there we all were, watching this young man dying with a bullet through his liver, gripping the arms of his comrades as he stares up into the sky and moans for his 'momma.'What a powerful scene. What a powerful movie.Nine out of 10.Go see it. Sit down with your child and make them see it, too. Maybe the D-day scene will leave such a scarring image on their minds that they'll make some changes somewhere down the road. Big changes, so fat rich old men in bunkers won't see it as a necessity to send 17-year-old boys dashing through bloody waters into a hail of bullets.",Null,0,0,5 November 1999
28 Days Later...," A very good movie
","I love zombies. Much more so than vamps or werewolves or possessed children vomiting pee soup. There's something so simple - and yet so methodically terrifying - about zombies and their single-minded feeding goals.Like 'Sixth Sense' was to ghost movies and 'The Ring' was to splatter films, I think this movie is morphing zombie flicks, and in a very good way.The plot is pretty simple affair (how complicated can a zombie move get?). The opening gives me more reasons to hate 'greenies' and their naive ways. The protagonist shuffling through the streets of London in hospital digs and a bag of coke cans is just... eerie. Very well done. And the movie does a good job of showing the brutality of the 'undead' - and later showing equal 'brutality' with the 'living' - primarily the rape and a rather gruesome 'live on live' death where the protagnoist kills the rapist with thumbs in the eye sockets. The man's death scream is very authentic, and will send chills and bumps up and down your spine and flesh. Worth the price of admission or a rental, and the fact that its set in London adds to the movie's wonderful feel.8.5 of 10.",Null,1,2,30 October 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Not like the book...
","I am a 'Tolkien geek' who thinks Tolkien would hate Peter Jackson and his films were he alive today and watching them. I live and breathe Middle Earth and I cannot even begin to fathom the injustice that Jackson has done with his movies. For example, in the 89th minute of the film, Aragorn lifts his left arm and points off into the distance. When I saw this I thrashed about in my seat because EVERYBODY knows that in the book, Aragorn raises his 'right' arm and points. Why can't Jackson get that right? And later, in the battle for Helm's Deep, Gimli bellows for the foe to 'come at me.' In the movie he yells 'Come at me' to the foe but quite clearly (I've now seen the film three times already since Wednesday) you can hear that it, indeed, is a yell and NOT a bellow. At the beginning of the movie, when Aragorn, Gimli and Legolas are tracking Merry and Pippen, Legolas stops and stares off the west, but in the movie, due to the position of the Sun, he appears to be looking more southwest. And in another scene, Aragorn is seen with his sword shackled to his left hip when in the book his blade was described to be scabbered to his 'right' hip. And right before the battle of Helm's Deep, it states in the book that the enemy stomp their feet and then their spears, but in the movie only the spears are 'beaten.' Why is this? Was it too much to ask for the actors to stomp their feet, too? I know Jackson should be praised for doing what nobody has ever done, or even attempted to be done. I know this could have been two films, or even a lone film. Or even worse an ABC Mini-series. I know this movie is doing to the fantasy genre what 'Star Wars' did for science-fiction. And many people have told me that Tolkien, were he alive, would be thrilled and tickled pink at the attention that has been lavished on his epic, exhilerated by the movies and his imagination brought to life on the screen. In fact, my best friend told me the other day that Tolkien would probably pull a 'Shatner' on guys like me, telling me 'to get a life' and not psycho-analyze this movie. Perhaps he's right. But then again, I've read the 'Lord of the Rings' at least 1,000 times since age 12, and so my usual retort is that 'I know more about this trilogy than Mr. Tolkien himself does.'But why can't directors simply film pages from the book? Just start at page 1, roll camera, read the dialogue straight from the pages, and film a movie? If the story can thrill countless millions in the minds of its readers, than surely this same UNALTERED story can do the same through the lense of a camera? Why has Peter Jackson made so many subtile changes from the book? Yes, yes, yes, obviously the worgs that aren't there or Aragorn's plunge over the cliff are huge deviations from the book, but what's gotten me so vexed are the 'small' changes as well. It makes no sense since the action IS RIGHT THERE IN THE PAGES OF THE BOOKS!Don't see this movie. Mr. Jackson is dropping the ball with these movies and Tolkien is obviously spinning in his grave. Like that Helm's Deep scene when the rain begins to fall. It obvioulsy started falling 'after' the battle had commenced, not before as it was shown in the movie. And what about Merry and Pippen? They were switched sitting places on Treebeard as the latter roamed the forest in the movie? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?Mr. Jackson, shame on you!!!",Null,0,0,23 December 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Wow!
","Amazing. Simply amazing. This was better than I thought it would be. Others have described this movie better than I can so I won't bore you with repeated verbage. Know this: when the credits roll at the end of the film, you'll look at your watch and think, 'THAT was three hours!'I thought I would never live to see the day that a fantasy movie was made 'right.' After squirming through sludge that was the 'Dungeons and Dragons' movie and 'Willow,' or seeing a fantasy like 'Conan the Barbarian' turned into a more historical feature, it's so refreshing to see mainstream fantasy - which dominates roleplaying, computer games and books - finally crack the silver screen wide open. Many people have compared 'Lord of the Rings' an d its impact with audiences to that of Star Wars back in the late '70s, and I tend to agree. Star Wars was something new to many people, and introduced science fiction in a new way to new generations of people or folks who otherwise would have never cracked open a Harlan Ellison or Arthur C. Clarke novel.I hope 'Lord of the Rings' opens up this new genre to other 'realistic' attempts, and buries forver the dragon dung that is 'Willow' or 'Dungeons and Dragons' or 'Legend.' I hope to see the 'Dragonlance' Saga brought to the Silver Screen, or perhaps Brooks' 'Shanara' series or even George RR Martin's new fantasy series. At least this lays down the foundation for future works and shows that, yes, it can be done.At the very least I hope Peter Jackson embarks on 'The Hobbit' when it's all said and done. Imagine the pure movie bliss of watching the Hobbit and then the LOTR - all in wonderful, extended, uncut versions - one right after the other on DVD. Ahhhh...And one final remark. I shake my head at what I call the 'Tolken geeks' who are screaming at the 'diversions' Peter Jackson has made in his translation of the book to movie. Remember that it's extremely difficult to translate one medium to another. In fact it's downright impossible. Had Jackson filmed every single page of Tolkien's epic in order, you would see mush up on the screen; it simply would not and could not make sense. Let's face it, if movies concerning World War II were made 'authentically,' hours and hours and hours of it would be troops marching, eating and sleeping without any hint of action. Who would want to see that? Jackson has remained true to the ethos of the Tolkien story and spirit, and that's key here. Not that he left out Tom Bombadork or had Legolas brush back his hair at the beginning of 'Two Towers' instead of having him rub at his eye and THEN brush back his hair. (eye-roll)Sometimes I want to walk up to one of the many 'Tolkien geeks' on this board and ask them how they would feel if 'normal' Hollywood had gotten their hands on this project? When Jackson first took TLOR to Miramax, they asked to make *two* movies. Egads! What if Jackson had shrugged and said, 'okey dokey!' A lot of other directors/producers would have done that. Or what if typical Hollywood production company insisted on a *single* two-and-a-half hour story to tell the entire trilogy?I recommend to every 'Tolkien geek' who has already flamed this film on this board or are preparing to to think about what I said above, and to add Peter Jackson to your prayers tonight, thanking him for staying as true to Tolkien's word as humanly - and artisitcally - as possible.This movie is a 10.",Null,0,0,19 December 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," K-19: The History Re-maker...
","I don't fault much in this movie. The acting was nice; the special effects were nice; the men turned cripsy critters were... well, you know, pretty 'realistically' disqusting. Wrap up all that and you have a nice summer movie. I liked the fact that the movie's viewpoint was from those living behind the Iron Curtain, where the Americans were viewed as evil. I got a kick out of that. You also got to see Soviet males fear Americans as much as American males feared the Soviets during a very hectic time filled with tension. I particularly liked the authentic goings-on with Russian command, how the Russians would rather die than give up their boat or lose their reputations. I had a problem, however, with the movie's ending. Particular a very un-Russian sentimentality. I've studied Russians over the years; especially their conduct fighting the Germans on the Eastern Front during World War II. This is a race where hardships were endured and almost embraced. Afterall, this is a country who had Russian villages charged German defenses to 'use up most of the Nazi bullets' before the soldiers were sent into the lead storm. This is the country who launches their cosmonauts onto tin-can space stations and keep them up there for a year, risking major psychie damages. In the movie, the Russians cared about their men. In reality - in a Communist society - individuals don't mean anything when compared to the masses. The Russians have lost countless subs over the decades, K-19 would have proved no differently. The ending where the seven men who died from radiation was something you would see from Americans, or western Europeans, and NOT from hardened Russian men brought up in a Communist state where there is no such thing as an 'individual.'Because of this 'American-like' unauthentic sympathy by the surviving boat members for their fallen members, I give this movie a '4'.Bogus.",Null,0,0,28 July 2002

Signs," Best movie of the year
","The new century's Spielberg -- Shymalan -- does it again with 'Signs.' Make no mistake about it, it's one of the best movies of the year. I won't go into any details about the movie except for this: The movie is a movie about Armageddon, about demons assaulting humans due to a lack of worldwide spirtuality that currently dooms our society. These 'demons' - posing as alien invaders - do their best in a midnight assault to take as many humans as they can with them, but a rediscovery of our faith in God (including the weapon that defeats the aliens that comes out of the Middle East, which so happens to be the birthplace of Christ himself) overcomes this assualt on humanity, with love for family and a faith in religion winning through in the end. Our society today - which mocks God at every turn - should think twice about the consequences of a Godless society; the total breakdown of morals and values that would come about in such a society.Signs continues to displays M. Night's expanding skills as a director/writer, and I can't wait to see his next film.9/10.",Null,0,1,5 August 2002
Identity," Very good movie...
","I really liked this movie. I actually read the reviews about this movie before I went to see the movie, so I knew what I was getting into. Since the tickets were a $1.50 a pop, I wasn't gonna shed many tears had the film turned out to be as bad as the critics on this board have labeled it. To me, this film was a case of 'damned if you do and damned if you don't.' Don't know what I mean? Well... several folks in their reviews above have pompously stated that the first hour of the film was great and the last hour, unfortunately, wasn't so great. Well, if that was the case, then the first half of the movie was shaping up to be yet another movie based on the premise of a shadowy Jason Vorhees stalking unsuspecting victims with a... how original... a knife. Don't get me wrong, the first half of this movie - based on this premise - was done extremely well. To me, it was the latter half of the film that saved it - made the movie so innovative, in a genre that is desperately lacking originality these days. However, had the movie turned out to be nothing more than a sophisticated slasher film, than no doubt these same 'critics' would have howled and whined and moaned about how 'unoriginal' this film was, how it was retreading where other movies have walked before it. So, in the end, 'Identity' can't really win. By changing or 'pulling out the rug' to stay original, the movie is blasted. Yet, had it stayed true to its roots shown in the first hour of the film, it would have been labeled as a 'tiresome retread' or 'unoriginal.'So in the end, don't listen to this 'would-be, wanna-be critics.' This is a great film with a neat twist. It's not about a lunatic on the loose with a knife. It's not about (gag!) vengeful Native American spirits or aliens from the Pleades. It's a great movie with great twists and great character development that won't leave you disappointed. My only criticism is the last 2 minutes of the film. The movie would have been perfect had it ended with the 'triumphant personality' driving off to Florida and enjoying those acres of oranges. Somewhere in the 'Hollywood rulebook' it states that a horror movie *must* have a shocking, evil ending. Why? It WOULD be innovative to have a movie of this type ending happily, with good triumphing over evil. You know, it's been so long ago since a horror movie ended happily that such an ending now would again seem refreshing and... wow!... shocking. Other than the appearance of the missing child in the end, a great movie. 9/10.",Null,0,0,12 July 2003
