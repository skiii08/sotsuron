The Ring," Just another tired ending....
","/* This review MAY include spoilers - depending on what information you deem important. */I gave 'The Ring' an objective try Thanksgiving evening.My knowledge of the movie was limited to understanding A) If you watch a specific video tape, you will die in 7 days, B) The movie is a recent addition to the 'scary movie' genre, and C) the movie has been doing quite well at the box office.I do not profess to be some intellectually pompous boob who will critically analyze every detail, both explained and unexplained, to death.  However, I have to say on a high level objective viewing of this film, 'The Ring' was disappointingly tired.I really liked the film's premise (see A above).  Wouldn't it be frightening to know that in 7 days a creepy death will fall upon you?  The way in which the main character re analyzed the video a second time (Why not?  She's going to die anyway, right?) and discovered clues as to it's origin was fascinating.  The video itself was creepy and well done.  The young heroine's perseverance to get to the bottom of the video's meaning was riveting. ...and then I got tired, really tired.First off, I am tired of every creepy movie (see: The Shining, Six Sense, et. al.) having some young kid who 'sees inside of the mind of the evil doer.'  This movie has the same old clichés:  The boy says to mom 'She's yelling out to be released,' and the boy draws deep disturbing pictures of a far off evil place using his crayons.  Of course, when the time comes that mom must figure out a clue or two - she turns to the son and says 'What is she trying to say?'This has been done a million times.In lies my potential *spoiler*.  This movie has the proverbial person (in this case, a little girl) who 'disappeared' 25 years ago without a trace - she was abused by her parents who wanted a perfect child but became troubled when they discovered their only child had a mental illness.  So the child mysteriously 'disappeared.' ...and today, we have a young boy telling his mom 'She's yelling out to be released.'This has been done a million times. ...and then I got tired, really tired.The visuals and special effects were good.  It was a good premise, yet it went so wrong - ESPECIALLY the ending.  Wait! Did the movie really end?This movie had all of the traditional clichés of 'catching up with the girl' by the end.  The movie should have ended.  But no.  When mom tells her son 'the girl has been released,' her son replies 'what did you do that for? You shouldn't have done that!'We get 20 more minutes.This movie had all the makings of a good creepy movie with a riveting premise.  But, inevitably it got tired with endless flashbacks, child clichés and a plot - not only done a million times - that would not end!",Null,0,0,2 December 2002
Citizen Kane," I am torn with Citizen Kane...
","I am torn with this movie.  I am 38, college educated, but had NEVER seen Citizen Kane until last week.  I recognize that this movie is often rated number one of ALL TIME.  I decided to rent the movie last week and form my own unbiased opinion.I can feel it. I can sense it.  I know why some find this movie great. The cinematography and screenplay is awesome.  The movie moves rapidly from scene to scene. The 2 hours went by in no time. The plot comes full circle as the movie concludes. It is truly a dynamic movie.At the same time, I can't run out and say 'You have to see this movie!' I found it dark, sinister, and downright depressing. While black and white is classic film making, it can often create light and shades that are emotionally difficult to watch. Perhaps that's what makes Citizen Kane so great to so many.  But at the same time I am spoiled by today's movie technology. I find it difficult to relate to movies that are so old (60 years) that the primitive technology effects my ability to appreciate how good a movie may have been IN IT'S TIME.The greatest movies of all time will stand the test of time.  The Godfather was made nearly 30 years ago and it has a whole new generation of fans.  The college campus reaction to Citizen Kane would suggest that it does not have the same staying power.As I said...I am torn with Citizen Kane",Null,0,1,2 April 2001
Snatch," Know what you are in for...
","Snatch is a good movie!  The dialogue between the character is some of the most dynamic I have heard in a long time.However, I do feel sorry for the poor sap who rents this movie with no preconceived notion of what the movie is about or whether it is comedy or drama.  Snatch is the type of movie that shocks you from the opening scene. Not by the violence, but by the interlocking twists and turns of the characters involved.NO doubt, this is a hilarious comedy.Many have described the plot as complicated, thin, or even irrelevant.After my second viewing (I required two viewings just to make sure I could remember who was who and who said what), I realized that the plot is solid and an integral part of the movie.A group of crooks dressed up as stereotyped Jews steal a huge diamond.  The diamond is brought to London.  Then (at least) 5 sub plots occur during the movie:  There is Russian mobster Boris 'The Blade' Yurinov who attempts to secure the diamond.  There is an American mobster Cousin Abraham 'Avi' Denovitz who comes to London in an effort to secure the diamond.  There are 3 black petty thieves who are hired to secure the diamond.  There is 'Brick Top' Polford - a gangster boxing promoter who later finds out about the diamond, and finally there is Turkish, the narrator of the movie, and his buddy Tommy who are in deep s**t with the boxing promoter and they know nothing about the diamond...BUT....I will stop right there.It is obvious that Pulp Fiction played a MAJOR influence on this movie. The plot(s) go in various directions, are often out of sequence, and then come full circle at the end. This is not an insult to Guy Ritchie for using Pulp Fiction as an influence.  After all, imitation is the sincerest form of flatteryWhat makes this movie so good is the dialogue.  My personal favorite characters were the 3 black thieves AND their dog.  No point quoting them here because their thick English accents and the nature of their dialogue are necessary to put the humor over the top.  I never laughed so hard at dog and his squeaky toy.  Priceless!I will admit, from a realistic standpoint, there were several things that bothered me about this move.  The biggest problem was the non stop shooting of guns in public places, city streets, and no one notices or even cares? In one scene, Bullet Tooth Tony enters a pub, orders a dark beer, sits at a table and proceeds to pull out his gun and describe it to the thieves.  Five minutes later he empties no less than two clips inside the bar, and no one notices????  I know, I know, I am nitpicking.  Perhaps Guy Ritchie addresses this issue by having the police show up in full force at the end of the movie.  Don't worry, that wasn't really a spoiler as they aren't really relevant.As I said, this is a good movie.  I highly recommend it.Now you know what you are in for!",Null,1,2,14 October 2002
Hoosiers," Please. Try it; rent it.
","Look; I don't want to get all dramatic. This movie was never commercially big.  But TRUST ME; It is underrated.  See it, and you will say wow!!!  Why are classic works like these often overlooked? I just rented this movie for the first time.  I know nothing about basketball, nor do I care.  This is just a GOOD movie...",Null,0,0,13 May 2001
Titanic," Something told me not to see this movie!
","Did I listen?This movie made 800 gazillion dollars in the box office and every woman in the office had seen it 5 times!!!!!Me being a big history buff and totally familiar with the detailed plight of the Titanic, I though perhaps I should see the movie for the highly touted effects.But something in my head said 'But Brian, you'll be sorry!'Finally, I succumbed to the pressure and hype and saw it second run (I held out till the very end.)Just as I thought.  What a sappy three our cheesy love story bore!I knew it, I just knew it.The women just love this movie.  Ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I am glad it isn't rated in the imdb top 250 at least.  I still don't know why it made so much money.Wait a minute.  Yes I do.Soccer Moms!",Null,2,3,24 May 2002
The Deer Hunter," No No No!
","Spoilers to make my point...Dang this movie frustrates me.  Was it good?  Yes, it was high quality. Worthy of an Oscar?  Probably.  This movie had all the superb acting, camera shots, emotional topics of an epic film.But dang! Why in God's name was it so unrealistic and unexplained?Did the three friends get drafted or did they enlist?  If they were drafted, as some suggest, would they all be due to report on the same day?  Had they been through boot camp already?  If not, what are the odds that all three would be in the same platoon?  Can this be requested of the Army when enlisting with a bunch of buddies?I missed how the Vietcong captured all three of them.  I saw Robert Di Nero in a battlefield without the other two and next thing I know they are captive in a swamp cage.The Russian Roulette game was absolutely awesome.  But was all of Vietnam like this?Ok, I am only 39 and perhaps naive, but that is nearly all of Vietnam I saw in the film - a Russian Roulette game, escape, hospital stay, another Russian Roulette game - Di Niro and Walken were separated in Saigon and manage to end up together at another Russian Roulette game?  What are the odds of that? They didn't see each other?How did Savage lose his legs?  Last I saw he had a compound fracture of the left leg (unbelievably realistic!), but amputation from the waist down?Finally, Di Nero figures out Walken is still alive based on some money in Savage's drawer?  He flies 15,000 miles back to Vietnam - and at the very moment that Walken is to play Russian Roulette - Di Nero finds him?  What if he came a day too late? (Actually - in this case it wouldn't have mattered.)How did Di Nero get Walken's body back home?  The air lift was taking place at that very moment and he was far away from the US Embassy playing Russian Roulette with extremely hostile people and he manages to get Walken's body home?I know, I know...OK, I am nit picking!  But this is NOT a realistic Vietnam movie.  It just can't be.  The Vietnam scene in Forrest Gump appeared more realistic in terms of the soldiers, terrain, weather, and fight scene.I indicated I understand why this won the Academy Award - due to it's epic nature.But, it was still a hodge podge of disconnected scenes.",Null,0,0,26 July 2002
The Sixth Sense," This is the ONLY review you will need! - READ TO THE END
","I went to see The Sixth Sense at the theater opening week.  I didn't hear anything about the movie so I had ZERO expectations.I didn't like the movie because it was dark, depressing and extremely slow moving.When the movie ended, I was troubled and did a double take.  'Hummmmmm, I will need to see that again.'  Not as if it was good, but it was surprising.When I rented it and saw it for the second time:  IT WAS AWESOME!  I UNDERSTOOD IT!  It is one of the most perfectly mastered pieces of work I have ever seen.When you see it again, you will slap yourself in the head time after time and say 'Duh!'Rent it - Watch it.  But don't be so quick to judge it until you know all the facts!",Null,0,0,6 June 2002
