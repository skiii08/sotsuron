Walk the Line," Joaquin Pheonix was believable as Johnny Cash
","This is the first time I have actually seen Joaquin .I am an Aussie and have always been a fan of Johnny Cash.I was surprised by Joaquin's age to begin with because he seemed more mature.I think he did a wonderful portrayal of Johnny ,from the dark brooding attitude to the quirky sense of humor that Johnny had.He also seemed to connect with Reese Witherspoon in a way that the relationship seemed real.I've looked at the goofs,but I wasn't looking at the movie for faults,I was just interested in the basic life of Johnny Cash.There were lots of things in the movie that I was not aware of in Johnny's life and if the movie was real to life I thank the people who made it .I also liked the little cameos of the other performers in Johnny's early years as it was a surprise to see who started out at the same time as he did.I will be looking for more Joaquin Pheonix movies as not only is he a good actor ,he's easy on the eyes!!!!!!",10,2,3,11 August 2006
