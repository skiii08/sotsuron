The Avengers," More Hulk = 10 stars
","This movie was awesome, it could've been 10 stars if I would've seen more Hulk scenes. Can't you tell I'm a huge Hulk fan, lol . Anyways it was good, very well put together, I saw it twice, going on a 3rd well maybe I have'nt decided yet. I have a question tho, I follow the comics not real heavy but I read up on things. Are we going to have an avengers movie almost every year? for the next 3-4 years? cause in the comics they come across wolverine, spider-man and etc... during there next fight with thanos. And if so how's it going to happen, Fox has rights to some of those people if not all. I don't know, I guess I'm just looking for more action. They made corny Lord of the rings 4 hours long. How bout for the next avengers? And next time give the Hulk more scenes, he's the best one plus can't be stopped nor slowed down. I didn't like how they made him slow down, meaning it seemed like oh he needed help, oh please thats the hulk baby GREEN ALL DAY.....HULK SMASH!!!!!",10,5,11,6 June 2012
