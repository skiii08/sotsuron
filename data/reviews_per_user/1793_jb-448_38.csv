Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Just As Good
","Less action doesn't mean less good. It's a brilliant romp and deserves a watch for sure. Tarantino makes good films. Always has and hopefully always will. This answers questions like the Bride's name (Beatrix Kiddo) and we meet BB her daughter. Budd (Michel Madsen as good as he's ever been)Bill's brother is shown not as a slick assassin but a washed up drunk who is a bouncer for a strip club. He gets close to killing Beatrix y burying her alive. She escapes and finds Budd. But Elle Driver (Darryl Hannah), another assassin, kills him first with a Black Mumba. After fighting her Kiddo rips out her eye. She was one-eyed the whole movie through and now she eyeless. Kiddo leaves her to an uncertain future. She later tracks down Bill using a pimp Esteban (Micheal Parks) Bill's father figure and kills Bill. She leaves with BB and they live together happily ever after. If you like a good film watch this for sure.9/10",7,1,4,6 March 2008
Scarface," Rise And Fall
",Rise and the downfall of one bad mofo is the main point of Scarface. Set in 80's Miami we track the rise of Tony Montana 'Al Pacino' a Cuban refugee or as he puts it A 'political refugee'. After killing for a green card he rises up through the ranks of cocaine dealers until he reaches the top next to Sosa. He betrays him killing his friend and Tony eventually gets killed by assassins. This movie freaking rocks! Al is killer as Tony as he usually is and everybody puts in great performances. A great way to spend 3 hours and a fun movie to watch for sure. My friend Sean cant get enough and he told me about it. I watched it and just loved it. It gets 8/10 losing points for being so damn long!!8/10,8,0,1,2 March 2008
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Let it go
",I don't know everybody's problem with this. I've found none of the Star Wars films to be boring and I think everyone should calm down and think about this. Could you make a better film? Huh? Didn't think so here's some of my points on why this is a good film :Great FX :Decent acting :Great additions to SW universe (except of course JJB) :Fairly good story-line :and Darth Maul I rest my case,7,0,1,3 September 2008
Catch Me If You Can," Very Good
","I really do like this movie. It's got good directing, good acting, good script, suspense, you name it its got it. Tommy Hanks is good as you'd expect and Leonardo Dicaprio puts out his first good performance, (Liked Titanic, dislike him in it). This is a slick movie about a real life conman, who pretends to be many things and endangers peoples lives doing it! Tom Hanks is the cop hunting him down. It's funny how their relationship is portrayed as well. It's quirky and i think Steven used it well. Chris Walken is Leon's dad and as usual puts out a good supporting role. Overall, another good way to spend your time and a must for a Stevie Spielberg fan 8/10",8,1,3,6 March 2008
Fight Club," Long Wait Paid Off
","I'd heard a lot of stuff about this. Good And Bad. Mostly Bad. I'd been wanting to see this for ages and my prayers were answered when i bought it on DVD for 8 bucks. As soon as I got home i watched it... i was blown away. I heard that it was a bloke's movie. Guys beating the hell out of other guys but i found that it was one of the smartest movies i'd seen since Zodiac. A major head trip yes, but i completely understood this. Even when they revealed Tyler Durden wasn't real. I was shocked and i was applauding. It's one of the best films of the 90's in ranks with The Usual Suspects and Pulp Fiction and is worthy of a 9/10. I'm so glad i caught this film before spoilers caught me",10,0,2,18 February 2008
Zodiac," Brilliance
","Amazingly smart and amazingly brilliant this grisly movie explores the mysterious Zodiac murders and has one brilliant cast. Jake Gyllanhall is great as a cartoonist slowly driven to madness trying to solve the puzzle. Robert Downey Jr is magnificent as a reporter who ends up as a washed up drunk. Mark Ruffolo is also good in this intelligent thriller directed by the brilliant David Fincher. What a resume! Fight Club, Seven, Panic Room and now Zodiac. He solidified his position as one of the most unique talents in Tinseltown long ago and this does nothing to wreck that reputation. I look forward to future works. The most weird thing to this is it is never solved. It is an unsolved case!!! A mystery for the ages.8/10",9,1,5,3 March 2008
Knocked Up," Proof That Comedy Isn't Dead
","For a long time now, I've heard a lot of hoopla about Judd Apatow and Seth Rogen being the new kings of comedy. But frustratingly, I hadn't seen any of their movies. Until now. I can say that Rogen and Apatow are very funny men and that they've crafted a hilarious, outrageous yet surprisingly sweet tale but I can also say, in my honest opinion that they aren't the new kings of comedy. Once I see more of their movies I can judge better but for now I can say that they know how to make very funny movies and that they well on their way to bump off the likes of Stiller, Wilson (Owen), and Ferrell from the top of the laugh pyramid.This has to be one of the more amusing films I've seen in a long time. Lately the comedy level has been raised by future classics (Tropic Thunder, Juno) and then lowered dramatically (American Pie Beta House, and all that spoof nonsense), but luckily Knocked Up is in the first category. Believe the hype, Seth Rogen is bloody hilarious, Judd Apatow is a great director, Katherine Heigel is a good comedic actress and this deserves to be in the Top 07 Movie to Watch list of everyone.",9,1,2,23 September 2008
Taxi Driver," Masterpiece
","This is a dark grim look at the underbelly of the Big Apple. Bobby De Niro yet again puts out a perfect performance as Travis Bickle, a Vietnam Vet and a Taxi Driver. He drives around the place viewing the dark side of humanity. Pimps, whores, drug dealers he's seen it all. He sees them as scum. We follow him through this movie hearing his desperation to break free. He eventually meets 12 and a half year old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster, brilliant). He plans to break her free from her pimp Sport (Harvey Keital). His answer, is violence of the worst kind. This madman kills several people but is wounded. Travis is hailed a hero by the public and Iris moves back to her family. This is absolutely brilliant. Martin Scorsese hardly ever disappoints and yet again he hasn't. It's well worth a look but Caution! It's very heavy so children shouldn't really watch it. Enjoy! 9/10",10,0,1,21 April 2008
Fargo," Fantastic
","If your looking for a good time watch this brilliant piece of movie magic concocted by those masters of majesty the Coens. Every time they step out they rock and this is no exception. Mrs Joel Coen (Fran Mcdormand) is lovely as Marge, Steve Buscemi (a personal fav) is Steve Buscemi, a foul mouthed crim with a silent deadly partner. They set out to kidnap William H Macy's wife so her rich dad will pay ransom and Will (Money Troubled Chump) can split it with the criminals. Like usual it ends up in betrayal and murder featuring guns axes and a woodchipper! Poor Steve killed and shoved in a woodchipper. Nasty Stuff! Great way to spend 90 minutes.9/10",9,1,1,2 March 2008
"Good Morning, Vietnam"," Vietnam Funny?
","I never thought that a film on the Vietnam conflict could be funny but here it is, drink it up. Of course, now you've got more comedy war films these days (Tropic Thunder Anyone?) but I think this would be one of the first comedy based war films. Robin Williams outdoes himself here in a very innocent honest performance, hilarious and very human at the same time. His basic mindset is to brighten up the lives of some soldiers in a very grim, disturbing situation but anal politically correct superiors (the late great Bruno Kirby) hold him down. I honesty contemplate the weirdness of this. Blood and gore is outside all over the bloody place while some people are trying to sensor a morale boosting DJ!? Strange but true.Along with being one of the first war comedies it's gotta be one of the first movies to show the Vietnamese as actual humans. They live, breathe and die while some biased movies try to vilify everyone single one of them as blood lusting monsters. It's a nice change but this movie falls behind some movies (Apocolypse Now, Platoon) and beats others (Full Metal Jacket, Hamburger Hill) just for the simple fact that this was funnier while not losing any seriousness in the process. 9/10",9,1,1,28 August 2008
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Hasta La Vista Mofo
","Better than T1? Better than T3? Yes Yes Yes! T2 is more of a mainstream action flick than the noir T1 and much better than T3 this rules. Arnie is Arnie, Linda Is Sarah plus 10 and Ed Furlong (A real where are they now case) is superb. Action flicks are supposed to be explosive and this is no exception. If it's Miles Dyson apocalyptic suicide is awesome and when the T100 shatters after the immortal 'Hatsa La Vista Baby' line is also great. Unfortunately the bugger doesn't die and keeps moving! Damn! The only real blemish is Arnie dying! Thats shocking! The good guy never dies. Sorry for the cliché but hey come on! And that thumb in the lava was f**** ridiculous. Anyway, 9/10",9,1,1,26 February 2008
Apocalypse Now," Excellent
","I love war movies. Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, Black Hawk Down I love em, but this movie stands tall in the war genre definitely. This movie is a study of not only the horrors of war but the study of the human soul. Martin Sheen puts out a performance of brilliance which his son Charlie echoed 7 years later in Platoon. Marlon Brando, my favorite actor is constantly ripped on by people for his performance but he played a psycho really well. Kurtz is totally and utterly insane without a shadow of a doubt and he played a loon great. His death was the highlight of the movie which was inter cut with a slaughter of an ox. Powerful stuff. Some of my favorite actors are situated here, Ford, Fishburne, Duvall, Marty Sheen and the Big M. What a cast of legends. A movie that no-one should miss. 9/10",10,0,1,28 February 2008
The Usual Suspects," Oh My God
","Holy moly! Oh My God! This movie has to be the smartest movie ever and has the biggest twist ever. Keyser Soze? Who is Keyser Soze? Is it Kevin Spacey, is it Gabriel Byrne? Is it Stephen Baldwin? Who is Keyser Soze? Thats the question Bryan Singer poses in this wonderful film. It's a puzzle that in my opinion is solved. Verbal Kint is Keyser Soze. He made up everything from things he'd seen during the interrogation!! Smart bugger! Kevin Spacey puts out another wonderfully good performance and i was in awe of this film. Bloody Brilliant and always will be for ever and must be viewed by everyone! Everyone! Please see this film10/10",7,2,3,26 February 2008
No Country for Old Men," Masterpiece Of Epic Proportions
","Wow! I recently bought this film and was blown away. I've been a Coen fan for awhile and after the Oscar wins I knew i had to see this movie. After watching it, i realized the hype was right and everything positive said about this film is totally right. Great direction, great acting, beautiful landscapes and much more No Country For Old Mend deserves more than a viewing. It deserves to stand tall in my honor list next to Pulp Fiction, Goodfellas, Platoon, The Usual Suspects. I could go for hours. Jarvier Bardem's Anton is so frightening i couldn't believe it. His chilling attitude is horrifying and it's hard to believe there's people around like that. Tommy Lee Jones is effective as a old man serving the law in this brutal, cold world. Josh Brolin puts out another good performance in a year with great performances from him like American Gangster. He's good as a hunter dragged into a bloody mess due to his greediness in not taking the money to the cops. Anyway, recommendation galore. You Must Watch 10/10",10,1,3,1 May 2008
Donnie Brasco," I Will Never Forgettaboutit
","Depp, Pacino... another pairing made in heaven. Al Pacino And Johnny Depp star in this intriguing wonderful look at Donnie Brasco, the man who went undercover in the Mafia and nearly didn't make it. Who rises up through the ranks of the Mafia and ends up hanging with Sonny Black (Michel Madsen). Micky, please don't do utter crap, like Bloodrayne and start doing good things like this. Please. We're begging you. Anyway, this movie deserve more than just one viewing which i acknowledged by buying it on DVD. I still watch it a lot. I love the discussion between Paul Giamatti and Depp about the phrase Forgettaboutit! If you couldn't read that it's forget about it. One thing is don't forgettabout this comment. Watch this movie, it's well worth the time...8/10",8,1,1,6 March 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Ultra Brilliant
","This is great! Quinten Tarantino always delivers and this is absolutely no exception. Bloody, stylish and wonderful this movie will rock your world. Uma Thurman (The Bride, she has a real name but i wont mention it yet) is a woman, pregnant and ready to marry a guy called Tommy. She was formally an assassin. Her old boss Bill (David Carrandine) and his assassination squad The Deadly Vipers kill everyone at the wedding rehearsal in the El Paso Wedding Chapel Massacre. Except the Bride survives (despite being shot point blank range in the head by Bill). She awakes from her coma and kills a would be rapist. We actually start with her being shot then she kills Vernita Green (Vivcia A Fox) A member of her old team. She then sets out for revenge against O-Ren Ishii. After a spectacular gory battle with the Crazy 88 she kills O-Ren Ishii. We find out at the end that that Bride's baby is still alive! What a cliffhanger! She doesn't know but we do. Anyway, a must see 10/10",9,2,5,6 March 2008
From Dusk Till Dawn," The Weirdest Twist Of All Time
","If you hadn't gone into From Dusk Til Dawn without knowing about the vampire bits, WTF would be the most accurate thing you could say for sure. I mean honestly, it starts off criminal bros kidnap family take em over the border, while being fairly good we've seen it before. We get to the Titty Twister. Still good, wow! Cheech Marin and cult actor Danny Trejo! Then ever more wow! Selma Hayak seductively dancing! Wow! Then heads roll, green and red body fluids spray and George Clooney has to kill a vampire Quentin Tarantino. OTT, violent, sexy and oozing style this movie is a mind-blowing experience and will make you return over and over again. It's real strange stuff but real good s****.",9,0,1,3 September 2008
Blood Diamond," Best Movie Of Last Year
","In Australia, Blood Diamond was released in early 07. It took me over a year to see this and last night i settled in to watch. I expected a lot and hell yes did it deliver. This movie is savage, explicit, violent and so damn well made. It's back at the turn of the millennium 1999 when war ravaged on in Sierra Leone. Amdist it all, a fisherman is kidnapped and taken to toil and find diamonds. He finds one hell of a diamond and hides it. After he is put into jail following an attack he gets out. We basically follow the fisherman, Davey Archer (Dicaprio pulling out yet another brilliant performance) and a female journalist trying to find the hidden diamond amidst an awful war. Powerful images abound this film. Kids carrying machine guns and killing people to the tune of gangsta rap. Bodies strewn around the war ravaged streets yet beautiful poignant images as well none more poignant than the last image of Davey Archer dying in the sunshine. At peace. Please watch this film. It deserves so much applause.9/10",9,0,0,9 March 2008
Once Upon a Time in America," Very very very very long
","One hell of an epic film tracking Robert De Niro through a long amount of years. Bob again puts out a wonderful performance and the rest of the ensemble cast perform well in this epic film. Forget Ben Hur, forget Dr Zhivago this movie is huge in scale and isn't really in one genre. Art-house? Gangster? Drama? Romance? It falls into many categories and we can never really decide which one fits it perfectly. Oh well, Mr Leone in his last film goes out with a quiet bang but I don't mean its not good. It's brilliant. But this is a very quiet flick. Ending with the cryptic smile we never know what De Niro's smiling about. It's an enticing mystery.8/10",10,0,4,2 March 2008
Reservoir Dogs," one of the best
","Whoa What a movie. Utterly brilliant. This movie is phenomenal. What's the most amazing fact is that this was Quentins debut which is sweet. Michel Madsen's best movie ever. It's a shame he died. But then again, so did Mr White, Mr Blue, Brown, Orange Joe and Eddie. The list of actors is also amazing. Harvey Keitel, Steve Busecemi, Tim Roth, Chris Penn, Quentin Tarantino himself and of course Micheal Madsen. And some of the lines. Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are ya gonna bite is a classic. Harvey with a simple yet great line Hardy Effing Har is a nice entry. And Steve Busemci. 'Want a smoke' says Mr White. 'Nah i quit' replies Steve. Pauses, 'What you got one' Steve was good here too on par with with his performance in Fargo. The ending is great too. Everybody dies except for Steve. Jeez, talk about bloodshed. And that poor cop. Ear cut off, emotionally wrecked and eventually shot to death. But that ear cutting is absolutely messed up. The use of Stuck In the middle with you (its a song) is freaky. It's pretty scary. All in all one of my favs and the best ever debut film by and director",10,0,2,19 August 2007
Pulp Fiction," best movie ever
","Quentin Tarantino made his best film in 1994 with pulp fiction. The best cast in a movie i have ever seen. Sammy l Jackson, john travolta, Bruce Willis, uma Thurman Eric stoltz i mean come on. The plot absolutely rocks. Some people said that the sequence is a bit confusing but i kept up with it. But (spolier space ahead) Travolta dieing is a shame because he rocks. Sam rules as Jules. He's funny as hell but can scare the heck out of you when the bible scene comes on. That's the only reason i've ever picked up a bible to find that passage. Pumpkin and Honey Bunny are sweet as well. Tim Roth was funny as hell at the start. Bruce was also good too. Too bad we didn't see the boxing match. Ving and Bruce in the basement scene though. Creepy as. Anyway great movie must see for everybody 10 out of 10",10,0,2,29 July 2007
The Departed," best movie of the 2000s
",Freaking awesome movie. Wahlberg at his absolute best even beating stellar performances by heavyweights like Matt Damon Leonardo Dicaprio and even Jack freaking Nicholson. Martin Scorsese your a legend. Best ending of a movie i've seen in a long time. Twist after twist awesome. The academy made a good choice for best picture. Martin is on par again with oldies like Goodfellas and Casino. Wahlberg once again kicks total ass. He's so damn good as the smartass foul mouthed cop. He based it on the cops that arrested him when he was younger. Thank god for them or Wahlberg wouldn't have gotten the nomination. This a must-see for any fan of Martins work,8,1,3,29 July 2007
American Gangster," Brilliant Gangster Epic
","I recently went to see this at the cinema. I'd heard a lot of stuff about American Gangster. Epic? Check. Great Acting? Check. Brilliant direction? Check. Excellent film. Check. This is a brilliant, brutal look into the life and times of drug lord Frank Lucas (Denzel Washington) and the cop who brought him down (Russel Crowe). Along the way, there's death, betrayal, and a lot of expletives. But it's all worth it to watch one of the best movies made in the decade. Ridley Soctt throughout his career has made brilliant movies and this is no exception whatsoever. If your looking for a good movie to watch this is a great choice.9.5/10",7,0,1,18 March 2008
Shooter," Better Then Most
","Well, what can I say about Shooter? A politically charged thriller rolled up in an action packed 2 hour blast-o-rama. A little too rolled up. If the director's original intentions were to make the action movie with serious political motivations he succeeded and failed in equal measures. You can feel the political under-tones in several spots but then over-blown action rolls over and kills it. When it seems like it's going to go deeper and it does seem like it too; Marky Mark and co. blow s*** up and kill heaps of people putting you off the trail. While it did succeed in making a better action movie then most in the market, it still lacks but what do you expect. If you want to sit down for 2 hours and watch explosions this will satisfy and make you feel smart. Knock yourself out. *** out of *****",8,0,2,23 September 2008
Platoon," A Savage Moving Movie
","Whoa! Vietnam must have been one hell of a hell-hole back during the Nam War and this is one disturbing view of it. Charlie Sheen, Willem Dafoe, Tom Berenger even Johnny Depp is in this and all put in good performances. This isn't really a kids movie at all. Harrowing, Disturbing, Savage, Brutal, Violent, Gruesome, Mortifying and Moving are just some words to describe this but it's brilliant too. I was upset when Elias (Dafoe) died. Will Dafoe is a great actor and everybody is good here. Berenger is brutal and Sheen plays the perfect character for the role. An untainted soul that slowly corrupts during the awfulness of Nam. Still the best Vietnam Movie I've seen and definitely one of the best in the war genre overall.9/10",9,2,3,26 February 2008
Raging Bull," Brutally Brilliant
","Whoa! Martin can pull anything out of his behind and make a masterpiece. If it's a caper, gangster, period piece or anything he can do it and in 1980 he made a boxing movie. And it was so so so good. And it deserves applause from everybody. De Niro like usual is great and his usual partner in crime JP is also good as his brother. This really isn't all about boxing. It's a study on how messed up a mans life can get. Jake had it all but he lost it all to. His sense of manliness is shattered and he ends up a shadow of what he could of been and thats the saddest part. Just like most of the cinema's boxers (Except Rocky Balboa) he ends up missing the biggest chances of his life. Scorsese you've done it again 8/10",8,3,5,20 February 2008
Casino Royale," Bond Is Back!
","Finally! Bond is back in a good movie.. It is bleak and it is more rough (as you can tell with the opening scenes in B/W this movie puts Bond in a new light and it's all thanks to Danny Craig. I'm sick of all the naysayers he is very good. The best Bond since Sean? Yes, yes and yes. The storyline is also good. I am a mad poker fan and James Bond+ Action+ Hot Babe+ Poker!!! = Awesome Film. Eva Green is sizzling as the new Bond girl with those green eyes (Cue cat growling sound). Best Bond girl in a long time. The Dame herself also performs well as usual and the directing is also good. I was shocked when Bond resigned but I knew it wouldn't last long. I loved the ending too. That jerk got what he deserved. As usual, a good way to spend 2 hours8/10",8,2,10,3 March 2008
The Truman Show," Alright
",I saw this movie for a film class at my high school. It was alright. The idea of The Truman Show is essentially that a television producer called Christof (Ed Harris) has created a fake world for Truman (Jim Carrey). In this fake island called Seahaven Truman has a wife (Laura Linney) friends and a job. Trumans life is a hit TV show broadcast all over the world with Truman not even knowing. But certain things reveal the truth and Truman deceiving the 5000 cameras and all of the crew and cast sets off on a boat (He's afraid of water since his dad mysteriously died in an accident. In reality it was fake). He reaches the end of the island and crashes into the edge of the set. He finds the exit door but Christof tries to stop him. Truman bows and leaves his phony world for ever....,8,0,2,9 October 2007
Casino," One of his best
",Martin Scorsese is a director who keeps on delivering every time. This is a movie set in 1970s Las Vegas and involves Ace Rothstein (Robert De Niro) a man who is given a casino job. His reflections on Las Vegas are timeless like when he compares it to Disneyland. His life is constantly ruined as well. His old friend Nicky (the brilliant Joe Pesci) is a violent psychopath who makes his mark in Las Vegas as Ace's muscle and as a complete madman. His most violent escapade includes stabbing a man to death with a pen. Nasty Stuff. He ends up betraying Ace by making love to his wife. He dies in a cornfield with his brother. The love in Ace's life is a prostitute by the name of Ginger Mckenna (Sharon Stone in a brilliant role). She constantly betrays Ace by trying to steal their daughter and leaving with her boyfriend Lester (James Woods). They leave each other and she dies a loner and a addict. All these elements screw his life up and his casino is demolished he returns to his old job as a sports handicapper. All in all a great movie but not Martins best,10,1,1,29 August 2007
Heat," A Classic
","Wow! De Niro! Pacino! Together! Oh my god! A partnership which is the stuff of dreams. Add Mickey Mann and you've got a film fans dream. And it was. Everything in this film is perfect. Acting, Directing, Script, Cinematography everything! It basically is the story of a cop Vincent O Hanna (Al in a brilliant role) trying to track down Neil (Robert De Niro also great) and his band of robbers including Val Kilmer and Tom Sizemore. It is a great character study and also has great action scenes too including the bank robbery which is great. Natalie Portman in an early role does well to play Vincents daughter a very very troubled girl. What a cast though! Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Val Kilmer, Ashely Judd, Tom Sizemore and many many more. That's what i call a great cast! Anyways, a brilliant classic and a must see.10/10",8,3,7,6 March 2008
300," Didn't mind it
","Another Frank Miller adaptation, 300 is the classic story of the 300 Spartans who took on a huge empire. Mythology rules this movie. Comments of homosexual tones are washed away with Lena Heady's performance. Very sultry woman who isn't afraid to love her man even if he is doomed to die in battle. Unfortunately this film does have it's flaws. It's very shallow and lacks likable characters. But it is stunning to look at especially the graphic battle scenes, the goriest of recent times that's for sure. And if you know the story then you know how it ended. The 300 are defeated and all perish. But the ride up to the grim end is wonderful and worth a look.7/10",7,1,2,13 March 2008
Jackie Brown," QT is still on top
","I only saw this for the first time recently. After being such a fan off everything else he did i hoped this wouldn't disappoint. Hoped? Ha! Like the guru of homage would disappoint. Not a chance. Pam Grier is a legend and should have won an Oscar for her wonderful performance as Jackie Brown. But what a supporting cast! De Niro (Fav Actor 01), Sammy L Jackson (Fav 02), Mickey Keaton, Bridget Fonda, Chris Tucker, My god! We basically follow Jackie Brown through her trials and tribulations. She is a 44 year old (still smoking though) air stewardess. She gets busted with money and drugs. After that she conspires to just leave her past life and the way to achieve this to help the cops. She gets a friend Robert Forster her bail-bondsman who also works for Samuel L Jackson, Jackie's boss. His friends, De Niro and Fonda are supposed to pick up money Jackie's flying in (under the noses of cops) but they get screwed in the end, De Niro kills Fonda, Sammy L kills De Niro and Sammy is murdered by the cops with the help of Jackie. Jackie leaves for Spain, after unsuccessfully trying to get Forster to go with her. Overall, another good movie by Tarantino 8/10",9,0,2,9 March 2008
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The Funniest Movie I Have Ever Seen
","Absolutely bloody hilarious. It's a riot. This film from those funny English lads the Pythons, follows King Arthur and his Round Table searching for the Holy Grail. This quest provides some of the funniest, silliest, hilarious moments ever on film. The Knights Who Say, The Black Knight, The Bridge Of Death all brilliant classics. The ending is also very funny. King Arthur and what's left of the troupe are charging a French castle but are stopped.... by the cops! They load King Arthur in the back of a police van and we end with a cop blacking out a camera! Very very funny. I first saw this when i was 6 and have always loved it. If you can laugh at something silly this is for you. It might be nonsensical if you aren't familiar with the Python's work but this is a great place to start. Laugh Out Loud! It's healthy.10/10",9,0,1,11 March 2008
Sin City," Noirtastic
","I heard a lot of shite put on this movie but i instantly dismissed all claims once i'd seen it as a pathetic waste of breath. This is great. The B/W mixed with color gave me Schindlers List flashbacks and i thought it was great. All the performances were actually really good. Bruce, Clive, Mickey even Jessica (Oh My God She's So So Hot But Cant Act For Her Life) Alba managed a decent performance. The only thing that upset me was when Bruce killed himself. Come On! The Big BW should never die. But oh well, it doesn't matter that much. Overall, this deserves a big 8/10 or **** stars and is worth a watch if your a noir fan. Enjoy!",8,0,1,20 February 2008
Donnie Darko," F***** Trippy
","Damn, this movie screws with your mind more than drugs (combine the two and you'll be more messed up than Donnie himself). This movie is breathtaking. Jake, Patrick, Drew, Maggie, and the rest of the cast put in good performances. It's hard to think that this is the directors debut. My mind cant comprehend the ending but what a ride. At the start Donnie's out of the house and doesn't get killed by the falling engine but at the end he goes back in time than Splat! He dies. The look that Donnie's mum gives at the end is a mystery to me and still confuses me. Good film and a great way to spend 100 minutes indeed and a whole lot better than the film i watched just before it American Pie Beta House. Sheesh!",9,2,6,2 March 2008
Goodfellas," One of the best movies from the 1990s
","What can i say about Goodfellas. Martin Scorsese's best film. Ray Liottas best film. Joe Pescis best film. Best gangster movie ever. It not only explores the world of organized crime, but it's very very real. Much more real than the Godfather. The performances of Goodfellas are legendary. Ray Liotta provides a gripping performance narrating. He starts off as a young kid with big dreams. Becomes a big cheese and is raking it in. Then becomes a drug addicted paranoid crazy man. In the end, all his friends are gone and he lives a horrible life living in fear protected by the men he used to hate. Joe Pesci is very very scary as a foul mouthed psychopath. Bursting out with swears abuse and violence wherever and whenever. De Niro is quietly brilliant next to these stunning performances as a quiet yet very dangerous mobster. The cast in this movie all have great roles. Lorraine Brasco is great as Henry's wife.This is more than just a gang movie. But a theory on life. You can either be a 'schnook' and live your life constantly waiting for things or become powerful and get them straight away. Getting made is the way to achieve this. Tommy (Joe) almost had this but it was cruelly taken away. Jimmy could have lived to be an old wise man but was betrayed by Henry. And Henry could have lived a long prosperous life but his demons overwhelmed him and brought about his downfall. Betrayal, Lies, Money, Paranoia and Death. Five key elements in Goodfellas",10,0,1,27 August 2007
The Simpsons Movie," Crying Shame
","I've been a fan for many years of those wonderful wonderful yellow people. I grew up with them and will always stay with them (TV On DVD) but this movie disillusioned me and i just wanted to slap not only David Silverman but Matt Groening and the entire team that made this atrocity to the Simpson name. I wanted a masterpiece and i got a average romp. Watchable but compared to expectations world wide, I don't want to swear in my comment because I might get in trouble but anyway. We follow Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart and the rest of the Simpsonverse as Homer screws up (again). Endangering lives he dumps Spiderpigs (An actual funny character)'s crap in the already polluted lake. The town obviously very peeved with Homer try to kill him but they escape when the government seals off Springfield in a dome. Simpsons are chased by government, Go to Alaska, Come Back, Save Day, everything as everything should be, Blah, Blah, Blah, who cares 6/10",6,3,4,7 March 2008
The Godfather," Magnificent Classic Film
","The very best film of the seventies. The very best film of the 20th Centuatry, the very best film of all time. Most definitely. While it's not my favourite film, (Pulp Fiction is the No. 1) It's in my opinion the best. The story is brilliant. The scenes whether the baptism scene or Sonnys death scene or that horribly grisly scene which involves one man one bed and a certain part of a horse, are memorable. The acting is superb. Marlon Brando's best even when he'd already played Terry Malloy and Stanly Kowloski (Two of the very best performances ever). Al Pacino's, despite what many Scarface fans might say, best performance he is great in Part One yet he is chillingly stupendous in Part 2. The list goes on. James Caan, Diane Keaton, John Cazele all shine in their own great light. Many people talk about this film but they can never sum it up right. Neither can I. It may not be the most realistic Mob film, Goodfellas would be the most in my opinion, it portrays the Italian mob so well, if anybody told me it was much different i would eat my hat. The funny thing about this is no matter how brilliant this film is the book is much better. If you haven't read or seen this film you haven't lived. Period...",10,1,2,7 September 2007
