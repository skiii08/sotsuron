Saturday Night Fever," Please...get real
","The movie goes NOWHERE except to the dance floor. The characters seem to stay stuck in place except Fr.Frank JR and Tony.....seems like the writing was only written for then 2 guys.Stephanie's character stays snotty thru the whole film and she's treated like she's 10 years older then Tony not the 2 years she portrays...and not good acting either. Donna Pescow might have been the best of show in the film...she acted different in different scenes and changed as the movie went on, not like the rest of the bunch When I saw it in 77 it was 'the movie to see....10 times'...looking back it was just a craze like the disco era. By todays standards it's a made for TV movie at best.....maybe a ROCKUMENTRY. Nowhere in the class of the Godfather or Rocky. I've been laughing the entire night watching it againKOOPS",3,3,11,9 February 2009
