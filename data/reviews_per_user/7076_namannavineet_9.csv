The King's Speech," Because I have a right to be heard! I have a VOICE!!!
","A memorable tale which was beautifully potrayed by one of the finest overall performances - THE KING'S SPEECH.
Colin Firth was at his best depicting the life of one of the greatest historical figures and I've to say he has done a staggering job. He probably gave a performance which will be remembered for ages to come!!
Other great performances by Geoffrey Rush and Helena Carter aided to produce one of the finest re-tellings of one of the finest historical events.The movie was so beautifully directed and depicted , that you almost find yourself within the premise of the Royal England!!
Hands down, one of the top biographies I've ever watched!!",10,2,2,19 June 2019
Casablanca," I think this is a start of a great friendship...
","I think Casablanca will start a great friendship between me and the classic movies!!!
Casablanca, an amazing story on friendship love and patriotism is one of the best movies I've seen. Magnificent as always , Humphrey Bogart played Rick a saloon owner in Casablanca , an unoccupied region in France during the WW2. His ex lover Ilsa now wife to Victor Lazlo an escaped prisoner of the Nazis come to the saloon owned by Rick in fortuity. With no other choice but to seek help from her ex lover Ilsa tries to persuade Rick to help Victor escape the german to America.
I was infatuated by the performance of Ingrid Bergman who plays Ilsa. She was an absolute peach with her amazing yet painful dialogues.
Casablanca will always be a monumental work in the history of the cinemas.",9,5,5,8 June 2019
12 Angry Men," A look at the jury members trying to come up with a fair decision
","A guy who has seen nothing but action packed movies , decides to just pick the movie based on the ratings and oh boy, probably one of the best decisions. It was a 'sitting at the edge of the seat' kind of a movie.
A completely unique classics of all time , probably one of the top 10 movies I've watched.
A must watch to every individual out there who likes to watch movies for any reason.",10,0,0,14 April 2019
Lost in Translation," For Relaxing time, make it Santory Time!!
","Lost in Translation is an example of how to make a simple script into an elegant and beautiful movie. A feel good movie about an actor and a simple woman and how they cross paths in Japan.Some scenes are very funny and memorable. Bill Murray has given a spectacular performance and the young Scarlett Johansson was good too.Great direction, really good background music at times and elegant screenplay makes this movie a great watch.",9,0,0,7 June 2020
The Shining," The best kind of horror!!
","Jack Nicholson!!!!!!!
How can a person petrify us just by his uncanny expressions alone?
For me this movie just kicked out all those new jump-scare horrors of the latest years, only by those hair raising dialogues and the spine-tingling acting by all the characters...
I cannot imagine any other actor other than Jack in this movie, it was a role made for him!!",10,0,3,14 June 2019
In the Name of the Father," In the name of the father - A masterpiece
","One of the best performances I've ever seen in a movie. This movie made me grit my teeth in a few scenes , it made me feel horrible being a human and it made me feel sad for the innocent to be charged. A movie worth a watch for every human out there...",10,0,1,30 March 2019

Jojo Rabbit," A perfect yet unique picture!!
","The movie was hilarious at the right time , emotional all the way , frightening at times and finally ends with a dance of freedom!
The movie revolves around a young 10 year old , who imagines talking to hilter and aspires to be in the nazi army. But he happens to find a young Jewish girl in his home.The movie will make you ponder upon on several scenes and ultimately makes you realise how cruel was the nazi regime in a uniquely satirical way!!",10,2,4,7 February 2020
