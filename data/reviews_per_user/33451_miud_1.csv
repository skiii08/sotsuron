The Blair Witch Project," FISHED IN !
","Warning : Contains comments that may spoil the plot.I was FISHED IN ! (by the hype) like lots of other film fans who enjoy movies that have well constructed plots and provoke thought and discussion.Although it was a decent enough plot and as much as I admire independent filmmakers efforts to make a difference, I feel that the execution left a lot to be desired. If you find - long monotonous shots of trees (both during the day and in the dark), close in face shots, piles of stones, listening to a pig-headed woman drone on and on, and a final shot of people running up and down stairs in an old house - scary, then 'Baby, this is your bag !'.I on the other hand, require something more substantial to bring my (horror) kettle to the boil ! I have seen scarier episodes of Scooby Doo ! Its old man Withers from the fairground... ! Oooh, chilling !I'm afraid that the only witch in this film is the girl who was shooting the footage. I reckon that in the old house, they fall victim not to anything supernatural, but some homeless guy who was defending himself against two nutcases running up and down the stairs shining bright torches !Big let down. Go spend your time and money on something worthwhile.",Null,0,1,12 August 1999
