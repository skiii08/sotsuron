The Blair Witch Project," go ahead, I dare you
","Do yourself a favor this summer and spend $7.50 on one hell of an experience.  See this movie if you don't do anything else but sit on your behind with a beer in your hand soaking up cancer causing uv rays this summer.  It is so very worth it.  I have never been so terrified, or amused, nor have I ever been so in tune with what was going on while being so completely lost in the near reality of what was transpiring.  See this movie for the sheer originality of it.  See it because creativity and ingenuity are finally getting the recognition they deserve in the success of this little horror flick that could.  But most of all, see it for the true terror and emotion it inspires.  You do not simply watch this movie.  This is not some overblown special effects spectacle, that looks so fake it's laughable. No, this is what really scares you.  The woods at night, the occult, and what you get when you put the two of them together...  You will experience this film with the characters as they hike through the Maryland woods, and whether for the positive or negative you will react, you will feel, and you will pray to God for the happy ending you know isn't coming.  See The Blair Witch Project.",Null,1,1,3 August 1999
American Beauty," wow
","I have never seen anything like this before.  It was funny, tragic, frightening and true.  I have never been so amused and yet so terrified. Kevin Spacey is superb.  Annette Bening gives the performance of her career. And Thora Birch has certainly grown into an impressive actress.  American Beauty is the movie of 1999.  If you see nothing else, see this.",10,0,0,2 October 1999
The Usual Suspects," Wow
",This has to be one of the most incredible movies I have ever seen.  It was superbly written and acted.  Kevin Spacey definitely deserved an Oscar for this one.  If you haven't seen it see it now.  A+... and that's only because I can't rate it any higher.,10,0,1,31 August 1999
"Girl, Interrupted"," Lisa of course
","This movie is in most aspects unremarkable.  I enjoyed it thoroughly; however, it was a pale reflection of the superb film adaptation of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  The script was not true enough to Kaysen's novel. Why, then you might ask, should you part with $7.50 to see this film?  I can afford you only one reason, but it's a damn good one.  Her name is Angelina Jolie, and her performance crackles with the energy of Jack Nicholson in The Shining.  You cannot help but be taken in by her.  She sets the screen ablaze with her brash honesty, quick wit, and total and complete lack of conscience.  She is what you have always wanted to be but were to afraid to admit it, or so you think.  Until you realize along with the main character that she lacks any moral consideration of others there is only her in her world and what she needs because to her others do not matter.  She fears nothing, and so she cares about nothing which gives her license to do whatever she pleases, no consequences.  She's the very definition of dangerous.  This is never explained in the movie, but Jolie gets it across. She's incredible.  Give her the golden globe and the oscar. 
Unfortunately, the real tragedy of this film is Winona Ryder.  She does a beautiful and poignant job of illustrating the conflicts within her character, but for all of her beauty, talent, and poise she cannot stand up to Jolie who dominates every scene in which she appears... and when she exits the scene for some time toward the end of the film she leaves the audience asking the same question as Susanna over and over, 'Where's Lisa?'",8,1,1,19 January 2000
A Clockwork Orange," one of his best
","Dr. Strangelove is one of my favorite pictures ever made.  It taught me to love Stanley Kubrick, which is why I rented A Clockwork Orange.  It is one of the most disturbing, frightening, intelligent, and incredible movies I have ever seen.  It was absolutely chilling.  I give it an A.  It's one of Kubrick's best.",Null,0,0,29 August 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," oh my God
","Before I start, my apologies to the memory of Stanley Kubrick.  I truly enjoyed his work especially the Clockwork Orange.  However, his last work, Eyes Wide Shut, has to be one of if not the worst movie I have ever seen. It dragged horribly.  There were times when you could have driven a mack truck through the dialogue.  It was uninteresting.  I knew how it would end ten minutes into it, and I desperately wanted to walk out on it at that minute but remained in the hope that there would be a surprise or a turn around.  There wasn't.  The question that kept running through my mind while hating this movie was, 'How many people can come on to Tom Cruise in one movie?'  Every ten minutes someone is trying to get in this man's pants, two women at once, a woman who had just lost her father who lay dead in the bed next to her and Cruise as she professes her undying love, a man, and a few women in the orgy scene.  Don't get me wrong, Cruise is beautiful but please cut us all a break especially since all he is in this film is pretty.  His acting left very much to be desired, but that's really nothing new.  He has his shining moments (Interview with a Vampire, Jerry Maguire, Born on the Fourth of July) but mostly he's trite.  His wife, Nicole Kidman, was the true disappointment of this movie.  Her American accent was dead on but everything else felt very forced.  She did not become her character for one second in this film, and after her performance in To Die For we know that she can if she wants to.  Perhaps she refused to do so, I know I wouldn't want to be her.  About her I continued to wonder how often a person can say fuck in one movie, or even one sentence.  Her use of the word approached ludicrous proportions.  The positives of the film all came from the directing and lighting choices.  They effectively created the eerie atmosphere the movie demanded, but the acting and script shot all of that straight to hell.  Don't see this film.",1,3,6,25 July 1999
