Vertigo," Hitchcock at his most addictive!
","Magnificent film, I never tire of it.  Even though I do not otherwise care for Kim Novak (I am not sure Hitchcock cared for her much either), I still succumb to the hypnotic power of this movie and find its argument totally persuasive.  Stewart is extremely effective as a man possessed by an illusion that defies reality.  And music simply sucks you in - irresistible. Warning:  this movie simply cannot be fully savored and comprehended in one viewing - multiple viewings are a must.",10,2,3,4 January 2001
The Deer Hunter," Best American Film? Certainly top 10!
","I consider this one of the very top American movies.  It is a many-faceted film the likes of which I have not seen often.  It is a  wonderful portrait of industrial and ethnic (Russian) small town America, for example.  It is also a tragic story of working class men (and the women they left behind - Streep is wonderfully fragile) who went through the ordeal of the Vietnam war, with varying, but ultimately equally poignant outcomes (broken in body and spirit Savage; unreachable, suicidal Walken; seemingly strong yet bereft De Niro).  And then it is a story of the powerful yet never articulated love of De Niro for Walken and its tragic conclusion.  The term 'Russian roulette' should be forever tied to this haunting picture.",10,0,0,4 January 2001
