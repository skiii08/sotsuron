Moneyball," Really well constructed movie that isn't made simply for the fans of the genre
","I was raised in a family where softball was everything. Not being a crazy sport movie buff, I was reluctant to watch Moneyball, but it's different from most sports movies. We don't get pointless montages of the players training or team mates having altercations. Instead, we are told the story of a coach piecing together a team and doing so with little to nothing. It's a different approach to a sports movie, and yes, it's pretty predictable, but what Moneyball does, it does well. Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill are dynamite in their leading characters, the film is boosted by the crisp editing, and the topic of financial difficulties. With so much running time I wish we would've seen more of the skimmed scenes shown in montages in Act 3; but regardless, Moneyball is just a really well constructed movie that isn't made for simply the fans of the genre.Rating: 7/10Grade: B+",Null,0,0,15 August 2013
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Mockingjay Part 1 has plenty going for it, but just as just as much working against it.
","The reason why 'The Hunger Games' series always stood above other young adult novel-to- movie adaptations was that did it not yield to the demands ordered by the money-hungry movie studios. Instead, the ambitions behind 'The Hunger Games' and 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire' were rooted in the quality of the film rather than the box office bottom line. The film adaptations of Suzanne Collins' novels had the advantage of critical support over franchises such as 'Twilight' and 'Divergent' because making the best movie possible was always the predominant thought on the filmmakers' minds. This holiday season welcomes 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1,' an entry that makes the franchise feel less special.After she destroys the Hunger Games, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) is rescued by leaders of the rebellion and now resides in District 13, an underground society occupied by the members of the revolution. President Coin (veteran actress Julianne Moore) and Plutarch Heavensbee (acting mogul Philip Seymour Hoffman in one of his final roles) ask Katniss to be the political face of the rebellion by encouraging the remaining Districts of Panem to join the revolt against the Capitol. Katniss agrees with the condition that District 13 will rescue Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and the other Hunger Games contestants being held captive by President Snow (Donald Sutherland) in the Capitol.As suggested in the title, the final book in Collins' series 'Mockingjay' has been severed into two separate films. Why? 'Harry Potter' and 'Twilight' doubled their profits by separating the series' final book into two movie adaptations. (Heck, 'The Hobbit' tripled their earnings). Why not sink another acclaimed series with the post-'Star Wars' financial battle for box office cash?'The Hunger Games' series has undergone many modifications since the last round of the fight-to-the-death, reality-TV critique in 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.' The pacing has decelerated considerably, 'the games' have been eliminated from the plot and replaced with commentary on propaganda, the majority story takes place in underground, and more focus is placed upon Katniss's emotional reactions to the putrid atmosphere of Panem's community rather than on the fan-favorite love triangle between her, Peeta, and Gale.The propaganda war between District 13 and the Capitol is the best component of the film. It is thoughtfully political and entertainingly clever. Also servicing the 'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' is Jennifer Lawrence, once again starring as Katniss. Lawrence's work is most notable for her natural ability in bringing an undeniable emotional intensity to this role with ease. Another success of this particular entry is the final shot of the movie. The first two films failed to impale the viewer with a meaningful and attractive closing frame, but 'Mockingjay: Part 1' makes an arresting statement in the image with which it leaves you.Director Francis Laurence gambles most of the story aiming for 'poignant' moments, scenes that are meant to study and affect the destruction of different areas of Panem directly caused by the government. There are the occasional scenes that dramatically succeed, but more often than not, the 'poignant' moments are ineffective and sit slayed by miscalculation from the Laurence. In addition, the visual style lacks splendor and the technical elements are not as smooth and agile as the previous installments.'The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1' has plenty going for it, but it has just as much working against it. This installment will not move you as much as the original film, nor will it viscerally excite you like last year's 'The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.'* * 1/2 out of * * * *Grade: B-",Null,1,7,16 December 2014
Vertigo," Mood-Setting at its finest as Hitchcock speaks his mind and soul
","Alfred Hitchcock has created some of the most interesting, distinctive, and chilling suspense masterpieces ever attempted in the movie industry. Already being a fan of his work and knowing of his life, I was excited to see Vertigo, but nothing prepared me for what I was up for. It's different from Hitchcock's other directorial efforts, definitely being the most personal. Vertigo glimmers with the touch of autobiographical art that works so well in other movies by directors speaking from their soul, like 8 1/2 from Fellini. The film is really as wonderful as its reputation holds it up to be. It's an enthralling piece that has turns so sharp it could cut flesh. Hitchcock creates an eerie mood that settles perfectly with the noir-eseqe story. It's psychologically engaging and challenging through the underlying suspense. Everywhere you look in Vertigo, there's a symbol. Each shot feels as if its been planned out and thought ahead by Hitchcock. The film editing hits every artistic note and the the score wows your ears. The entire movie plays like a ghost movie, but the fascinating thing about this explored theme is ghost changes with each Act. The ghost haunts your mind as it haunts the mind of James Stewart (who also delivers a fine performance), therein lies the brilliance. The film noir references create some poetically beautiful scenes that show the truth of human nature, whether its love, obsession, or insanity. Vertigo is technically ahead of its time, allowing audiences today to respond to it just as they would any movie released in 2013. It's a multi- layered film about complex characters, infatuation, and duplicity. Being autobiographical and knowing what we know about Hitchcock's life, some thoroughly depicted in Hitchcock (2012), Vertigo makes a lot of sense and we get to explore the heart and mind of Alfred Hitchcock. I believe, that Hitchcock, as a child fell in love with a proper, blonde woman, and she broke his heart. Now, as a response to that heartache, Hitchcock tries to recreate that fantasy to ease the hole left in his heart. The faux idea almost works as therapy for Hitchcock. Just my observation and a thought being thrown out there that could possibly explain his obsession and compulsion to the picture of his 'perfect woman' he paints all over Vertigo. Vertigo capitalizes Hitchcock's life, symbolizing his filmmaking and the tendency to emotionally and psychologically attach himself to his leading actresses. The pieces of the puzzle to Vertigo feel like the pieces of the puzzle of Hitchcock's life, yet they fit together anomalously perfectly in the film, but I doubt they did in real life. Hitchcock was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to visit the lives of fictitious people and pliably craft that perfect woman expressively through art. His madness and determination are seen in Vertigo, through the James Stewart character. I wonder if Stewart knew he was playing Hitchcock himself in ways?In all honesty, I can identity with Hitchcock's tendencies. Clearly, not to the excessive and creepy levels of his life, but there's always that hole in myself I've tried to fill with the idea of the 'perfect' best friend in my life, all have been beautiful, confident females. I can link my another obsession I have with Hitchcock's life tribulations: my spurts with actresses. Sarah Michelle Gellar, Penelope Cruz, Marion Cotillard, Anne Hathaway, Gwyneth Paltrow are all women I've went through addictions where they stayed with me because of their work as actresses or their displays of their success in life. I've never been able to put my interest with them into sensible analytical thought, but the slight obsession has always been there.Vertigo touches me in the same ways that propelled Hitchcock to complete this film, it's rare when a movie can do that a viewer, but that's a reason directors sometimes make movies. We're all human and we all have things in common that we can share with each other. Regardless if you can link your soul to the artistic soul of Alfred Hitchcock, Vertigo is certainly something not to be missed. It's an exemplary mood-setting mystery that still has viewers in awe of the artistry and the plot twists that set the fantastic finale into place. Rating: 10/10Grade: A+",Null,3,6,5 July 2013
The Monuments Men," An Award Season Misfit Moved to a February Release
","In the early scenes of 'The Monuments Men,' director George Clooney introduces his supporting cast of characters portrayed by John Goodman, Bill Murray, and Bob Balaban. Humiliatingly sending this group of elderly actors through physical fitness trainings before the film transitions into its World War II plot, the audience could confuse 'The Monuments Men' with last November's 'Last Vegas.'''The Monuments Men' boasts an impressive advertisement to entice the interest of the public. The cast includes Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, and Clooney himself; three reliable actors who can usually earn their films a stamp of approval. However, 'The Monuments Men' deceives its audience with a promise of a quality storyline that features American soldiers searching to retrieve irreplaceable art that Hitler and the Nazis have stolen from France.George Clooney may have been on the path of becoming the next Warren Beatty, a heartthrob actor turned serious director, until 'The Monuments Men.' His direction is not the film's sorest aspect, but the directing itself is substantially weaker than the skills he has shown recently with 'The Ides of March' and 'Good Night, and Good Luck.' He attempts to run the story with a path in mind, but his attempts feel like his legs were injured while trying run on that path. The film's score adds an essence of floating patriotism, which offsets the comedic tone established by writing.The difficulty of 'The Monuments Men' is the screenplay. In addition to acting and directing, Clooney also wrote the screenplay with co-writer Grant Heslov for 'The Monuments Men.' The dialogue tries diligently to make clever cultural references and create amusing one-liners, but most of the written word in the script flops like a poorly made piece of sushi. I wonder if Clooney was consciously writing the script or if he was actually executing effort; if that is the case, my heart goes out to his lacking ability to write competent dialogue.With those high-status actors, one would think they would be able to be the saving grace of 'The Monuments Men.' Sadly, the male actors show no signs of characterization, making their characters feel like extensions of their own personalities. The only performer who is marginally successful is Cate Blanchett. In her Oscar-winning performance in 'Blue Jasmine,' Blanchett played a character that arguably no other actress could portray except her. In contrast, her character, Claire in 'The Monuments Men' is a role generic enough to be played by any aspiring actress. In her first scene, Claire spits into someone's drinking glass and my response was a sympathetic one, knowing Blanchett is capable of better work.'The Monuments Men' wants to be a serious film, but falls back on comedy, becoming a real- life treasure hunt. Clooney attempts to force sentiment on his audience, but it is unearned and unwanted. 'The Monuments Men' was originally set to release last December (a fitting release for pushing films in the Oscar race), but was moved to an alternative February. My guess is the studio realized 'The Monuments Men' was nothing more than an award season misfit.",Null,4,5,26 March 2014
Captain Phillips," A Great Inconsistent Film
","My problems with Captain Phillips when I first saw it in an advance screening was the shaky camera-work and unnecessary jerky editing. I saw the Bourne movies and United 93, had no problem with Greengrass' work, but in Captain Phillips I found it to be distracting. Upon my rewatch I actually grew to accept and even, love the editing. I think it's part of the effect of the film, Greengrass makes us feel like we're inches away from being seasick. Being used to that method, I saw how closely sewn the cuts are connected. Greengrass' direction is the best of any of the films he's made; he pumps the fear into our systems. He makes the film 'click-click- click-click.'While I still find Abdi unremarkable, Hanks' acting is better than remembered and I praised the heck out of him before. It's a heroic, realistic, terrific piece of acting. He's stolen the win from Matthew McConaughey for Best Actor in my opinion and I never thought McConaughey would be dethroned. It's a performance that will go on to be one of the decade's finest. The quality of the screenplay stood out more and the development of Captain Phillips himself. I got this strange vibe that Phillips strangely cares for the pirates. The most pleasant surprise was the score, I was touched by its balance of tenderness and intensity. Captain Phillips is a throat grabbing thriller that I have grown to love.Updated Rating- 8.0",Null,4,9,10 October 2013
Iron Man 3," Stepping up from 2, but not farther than the original
","Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN 3Part 3 can be judged differently than the first two installments. There's a new director in town and Iron Man 3 being the first follow-up flick from Marvel after the substantial success of The Avengers. Iron Man 3 feels more like it tries sequel to The Avengers, rather than support the first two films. The tone and cinematography make you feel like you are playing a video game, not watching a movie. It's peculiar how dividing Iron Man 3 actually is. Foremost, the tone has a broad range of being the lightest film of the series to the darkest film of the series. Iron Man 3 takes some staggering risks that pay off, but could've had some more polishing to the script. It had some of the deepest emotional moments, but those are complimented by some of the fluffiest cheesy moments. Ben Kingsly is perfectly dynamic and frightening in his role, but the only thing Guy Pearce brings to his role is a pass card to get by the audience completely without them caring about his character one way or another. The film has the best action sequences and visual effects and strong character development for its hero. My favorite thing they maneuvered in Iron Man 3 is the message of the movie hitting the movie's opening and final scenes with and epic punch of Downey's narration. Rating: 5.5/10Grade: BMy next thoughts are dedicated to two men that are both geniuses gifted in their artistic expression. Joss Whedon could not receive any more respect from me for his masterwork on Buffy the Vampire Slayer. His show was humanity, love, and life conducted into 142 episodes of television. Unfortunately, my opinion of The Avengers isn't favorable to his film. The Avengers is geek-glorified trash that felt like an animated Saturday morning cartoon. All three Iron Man films far surpass The Avengers, for my money. I couldn't discuss the Iron Man films without paying respect to the comparison between this series and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series. I find the original Iron Man to introduce the story and develop it's characters better, even if it may lack the craftsmanship of Batman Begins. Nolan got the more impressive sequels, however. Contrast. Anyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. 'I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow' said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.",Null,4,9,5 August 2013
Casablanca," Closest Thing To Perfection Possible At The Movies
","The first five minutes of Casablanca can be daunting to the viewer. So daunting that they may turn it off all together and go about their day. That's what happened to me my first time, trying to sit through Casablanca. I didn't walk away because I was bored by it, or uninterested in what laid ahead, it was the fear of something so beloved not holding up to its reputation or flying over my head completely. Thankfully, I returned to Casablanca and I'm forever thankful I did because it's one of the best films ever made.In film schools, I'm sure Casablanca is the number one film analyzed for those future filmmakers waiting to make their mark on the industry. If it's not, it ought be. Casablanca delivers on every level technically, it's flawlessly constructed. It was made in the old-school Hollywood period where making movies like working in a factory, each part of the movie was put together by a specific person performing a specific task. The care and exertion put in by the set designer, costume coordinator, sound technician are all seen painted on the black and white, cinematography, which is my favorite part of the movie. The best photography ever put on film, playing with different camera angles, lighting, and emotional involvement like no film before it.The direction is the other driving force behind Casablanca that makes it a movie that stood the test of time. Director, Michael Curtiz, juggles all the topics covered in the brilliant script making them feel effortlessly collected. He creates a swift, moving picture. Casablanca is the movie that defines great movie montages. The writing nails the contrast of love and war, which creates a finely tuned script. Humphrey Bogart and Ingird Bergman establish the precedent of war films being romantic and 'the' movie couple of all-time. Casablanca depicts the wartime world better than any film you'll ever find. Its romance has sparks that still fly today and the political back dealings of World War II play like a new story we would watch at this present time. Casablanca is about sacrifice and studies the character of Humphrey Bogart, as if the man's heart was speaking to directly to the audience. Being produced in 1942 without the technological advances today, the quality of the mechanical areas involved stunned me. It's an exceptional story that breathes long after its expiration date.

Lifeboat," The Complexities of Trust
","Tallulah Bankhead leads the cast of nine in Alfred Hitchcock's Lifeboat, a film that doesn't necessarily begin with great impact, but one I left being absorbed with, wishing the story could go on. That's a mark of a film that develops the characters well, when the audience doesn't want the film to conclude and they have to leave the characters forever. The characters in Lifeboat aren't extraordinary people, they start out dry and uninspiring. But as they live in this lifeboat together for days, they begin to change affections with each other and the audience is exposed to the beauty that lies within them. The climatic action was concluding, I looked at the clock, and was disappointed to be leaving these characters I had grown to care like.Lifeboat's is morally compelling. The screenplay shows the difference between Americans and the Nazis, and tests an individuals trust. I'm the type of person who sees the weakness and humanity in everyone, so I believe everyone is deserving of a second chance. The first act, I had the thought the film was a metaphor for Capital Punishment; the people in the lifeboat against the Nazi were the republicans and the people giving the Nazi a second chance symbolized the Democrats. The characters divide and it's interesting to see them run with the tricky plot line.The big mystery in Lifeboat is the mystery of trust. Trust is the thing that holds our lives from falling to pieces with the people we allow (or don't allow) into our lives and what information about them we chose to tell (or not tell) them about ourselves. Lifeboat, at the core of the intention, is an anti-Nazi film. It gives Americans the opportunity to offer the Nazi's semi-peace and a second chance. But like I said, once Lifeboat reveals its secrets, the message about the Nazis are cut out with clarity. Lifeboat also explores the bonds made by these characters, bonds that any survivors of an accident could possibly (and most likely) make. Bankhead is handed a meaty and fascinating character, that she wrings out a great deal from. She carries the film with little help from the actors. Bankhead is marvelous overlooked by many because of the visual effects for the time. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is wonderful and on spot as one could expect. In a film that doesn't have much for the audience to figure out, Hitchcock keeps the audience on edge waiting for a big twist to come, but he allows us to get so personal with the characters that it doesn't matter that the twist never comes.The technical aspects for this movie are really quite interesting. The film was shot on a sound- stage and in 1944, the visual effects weren't up to today's standards so what we see today in 2013 looks like a simple job, well done, but really required much thought, time and effort. In the finale, especially, the visuals there are something impressive for that time period. The sound is also well-constructed. Hitchcock creates a eerie little movie, with fabulous lead performance and great character development. Rating: 9/10Grade: A",Null,0,0,26 June 2013
Chinatown," 1974 is rocked by the writing achievement in Chinatown
","As I wrote the title to this post, the year '1974' flashed before my eyes in terms of my opinion of the highly respected film Chinatown. I've now seen this film twice, the first time I 'convinced' myself it to love it no matter what I actually thought of it, knowing how highly regarded screenplay is in the movie industry. Honestly, I felt the film's pacing was a dud and Nicholson didn't work as the leading character. The screenplay was fine, but I felt like I was going to drown in my own saliva from falling asleep in this boring movie. I rewatched the film knowing where the story is going and having a firm grip on the plot and came out drinking the Chinatown cool-aid.My most substantial complaints of my first viewing of Chinatown, pacing aside, was the disappointment I felt in Jack Nicholson's performance. I before thought he was playing himself as a detective. Jack Nicholson the Detective, not J.J. Gittes, which is frustrating and awkward to watch. On second viewing, I took to Nicholson's performance more, he's serviceable with a few moments of finesse. When Nicholson is put in 'hammy' scenes, I feel like it's only Jack Nicholson that appears most times. Maybe that's why his work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is the best work of his career. He gets to play the eccentric character that he is in real life. Faye Dunaway emerges as the heroine grounded in mystery. Her character has layers that Dunaway is allowed to slowly peal off, each layer making sense from what we know about the layer prior. Chinatown is essentially a neo-film noir of its time, and Dunaway fits the bill of a noir heroine to a tee. Set in the 1930s, Chiantown features some wonderful costumes, sets, and cinematography that add to that era and the noir-feeling of the picture. The film score helps the picture set its wonderful tone, also.Roman Polanski is the man I have any kind of a beef with when it comes to Chinatown. Polanski excels at creating the rush for viewers in the second half of the film, but Chinatown's blinding flaw is that the first hour, Polanski lets the picture flat-line. The information we're given in the first hour makes sense at the end of the movie, we need to see these crucial scenes, but Polanski doesn't help make these overreaching plot arc scenes lively enough to keep me interested. The first hour succeeds on all levels, with the huge exception of the lackadaisical directing. The second half, Polanski shifts the film into drive, stomps on the gas petal and makes amends for the first hour's glacial pacing.Finally, what makes Chinatown 'Chinatown'.....the marvelous screenplay. Robert Towney penned the screenplay, which revived the noir-genre in the 1970s. Not only that, but Towney scribed a manicured script that had thick character development and a serpentine plot that keeps unfolding in your mind even after the movie has concluded. People probably confuse themselves searching for the allegory to bigger things in Chinatown's script, however, literary devices aren't why Chinatown is a step above most screenplays ever written. It's brilliant in the communication to the audience, keeping the audience under water in the mysteries (we're introduced to one big mystery to learn about multiple others in solving the one at hand) of Chinatown and the multiples secrets the characters conceal about their past. Chinatown opens its film in a odd fashion and goes against the formula of film noir anatomy with its first twenty minutes. It's very carefully plotted and tricky to comprehend at first. But then a mystery unfolds that's one of the most satisfying and involved conclusions to a mystery story. Filled to the brim with fine performances and wonderful decor, if you're willing to be patient and relinquish your full attention to the plot, Chinatown is a movie that resonates and unrolls in your mind. The more I've thought about the intelligence behind the film, the closer Chinatown is to getting a perfect from me. Rating: 9.5/10Grade: A",Null,1,2,13 July 2013
Gravity," Alfonso Cuaron finds life in space
","Space draws ours interest because most of us will never get to experience of the wonders that lurk there. Director, Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity is the best alternative to a trip to space. There's no hyperbole that comes with describing Gravity because it is in fact magnificent.Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is a medical engineer sent to space with experienced astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney) to service a Hubble Space Telescope. Before completing their work on the Telescope, they are hit with debris from another Satellite when the two individuals are separated and communication is lost. Dr. Stone, not a trained astronaut, must find her way to return safely to Earth.In 2009's Avatar, James Cameron advanced visual effects to new heights in order to fit his image of the fictional world, Pandora. Like Cameron, Cuaron's vision required him to invent new technology in order for the film to have the intimacy he desired for his audience. The visuals are essential to the enjoyment of Gravity. This isn't a film that could hold its weight with the screenplay alone.Gravity is the best use of 3D ever in film. I'm not a supporter of 3D, I never have been, but Gravity gives me hope that the future will properly suit each film that uses 3D to enhance the experience, not just a means to boost the box office sales. Cuaron makes us feel that we are taken off of Earth and shuttled into space with Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. We feel like we have become a part of the story, like a miscellaneous object floating with the characters. If Gravity lacked 3D, Cuaron would have had a more difficult time transporting us like he does.Children of Men, one of Cuaron's most praised films, became famous for scenes that consisted of the long, uninterrupted takes. Instead of three or four minute scenes of that nature, he pushes us even further with ten minutes without a single editing cut in Gravity. This flow allows the audience to funnel its focus into the film and think about nothing else. Cuaron only cuts when it is necessary to give us the perspective of his heroine.How hard would that be? Plays go uninterrupted for hours at times, why is it so special here? Because the camera-work must follow the characters, who succumb to gravity while they try to solve their predicaments. The camera zooms in on the two actors as they float frontwards and backwards, upside down, right-side up to make us empathize with the characters, as well as establishing and tracking shots to show the magnitude of the action and scope out outer space.The special effects are so realistic that a naive man would believe Sandra Bullock and George Clooney were trained as astronauts to shoot the film in outer space. Visual effects are hardly ever a sole reason to see a film, but Gravity is now the exception to that rule. Film critics and analysts have been left baffled to understand how Cuaron conducted the thorough realism of outer space.When an actor is offered a role that is a one-woman show for two-thirds of an entire film, it can be daunting decision to sign on. Sandra Bullock doesn't let the pressure affect her portrayal, in fact she pulls something out of her that we have waited for her entire career. Bullock doesn't challenge herself in the romantic comedies and the 'Feel Good' Lifetime-style dramas she often selects, but in Gravity she delivers a strong performance that makes me proud of her acting ability.Creating movies is like a balancing act. Screenplays that are intricately written with great details and higher meanings typically won't fare well if the director's mind is on spectacle. Gravity has spectacle at the top of its list. The film has so much to show us, therefore it makes sense for not having as much to tell. But, Gravity manifests that thinly plotted script can have as much meaning and life value as any novel adaptation.Gravity is about life. Not just life in space, but it questions how every one of us view life. Are we prepared to give up on everything because we've faced obstacles that have knocked us down, or is there beauty in fighting and climbing the ladder of life? Alfonso Cuaron finds life in space.Gravity proves stereotypes wrong. Who ever made it a rule that movies in space or containing action had to be unrealistic? Like me, you may have seen the trailer and posters for Gravity and may think 'I'm not in the mood for Science Fiction.' I'm sure there are some inaccuracies, but there's nothing predominantly unrealistic about it, the setting just happens to be in outer space. Don't wait for the DVD/BluRay, it won't be the same as the smashing experience in the 3D cinema.Grade: ARating: 9",Null,1,2,15 November 2013
Lone Survivor," Solid, Doesn't Set its Sights High Enough to be Great
","There are some great moments to be found in Lone Survivor, but don't be mistaken: this is not of the same quality as recent war movies such as Zero Dark Thirty or The Hurt Locker. It's a solid action movie that doesn't try to play in the big leagues. Lone Survivor is an ideal candidate for the newly created Critic's Choice Award category 'Best Action Movie,' a category created to honor finely made films that were not worthy of a shot at Best Picture (Lone Survivor is actually nominated for this award, too). The sound design is crafty and is the aspect that creates the most suspense. I great prefer the scenes of Act 1 and 2 compared to 3, the beginning scenes explained what was happening mark-by-mark and told a simple story. Act 3 relies on Mark Walhberg's attempts at creating a character outside his 'The Fighter' comfort zone. A pivotal moment occurs when the four main characters put their morality to the test. Any film that has their characters question morality deserves at least a chance. Grade: BRating: 6.5",Null,0,4,9 January 2014
Se7en," Se7en is suspenseful and contains performances that scream for award attention
","Se7en is the very interesting film about a serial killer using the seven deadly sins to kill his victims. That part of the plot alone should urge you to want to see the film, period. It's such an original concept. The writing goes farther than just the psycho killer stuff. It's much deeper and more emotional than that. From start to finish you never feel distant from the characters or the story. From watching the Siskel and Ebert review I started watching this expecting to get this NC- 17 material that slid past it's R rating. I'm not sure I understand why everyone thought Se7en was incredibly disturbing. Is it? Yes. But you don't see any of the actual murders, just the aftermath. Then again, I am very used to disturbing elements in films, so I may have an immunity to it. The performances from it's leads are the backbone for the film. Freeman and Pitt, very different roles, very different performances. Freeman's performance is nuanced, but still as effective as Pitt's, who has the showy, obnoxious role. He never fails to show us his intensity. Kevin Spacey's extended cameo here stands out as one of the best performances of 1995. With not even 10 minutes of screen time, Spacey walks away with the film. Se7en is a suspenseful film, but I look at it more intellectually, rather the entertainment value, though it's very entertaining. It's not as scary as many people think.

Citizen Kane," A Masterwork of Directing, Writing, Editing, and Cinematography
","I cannot find adjectives that describe the film in a proper tremendous way. Some of the best directing, cinematography, and editing of all-time, Welles' imagination is the force that makes Citizen Kane fly over any other inferior picture when it often takes the crown as the greatest film ever made. This is the way movies should be made. The filmmaking of 1941 is unmatched and my guess will continue to be. Welles is a genius and his mise-en-scene could be studied for years. Citizen Kane is smarter than most of the audience members who've seen it since the release. The journalistic side of Citizen Kane is also something that makes it shine as something special, the film feels like (and quite literally is) a reporter researching a story on Kane, each person he interviews is like a different paragraph in the news story. The profound message revealed in the closing 60 seconds is brilliant, true, and simple, that we never know the whole story to a person, personal complexes are the ultimate form of privacy and mystery.Orson Welles had to have been bitten by a hyperactive insect in order to successfully put himself in the central role of lead actor, director, and writer. Though solid in the acting department, his masterwork in the other departments are monumental. He must have envisioned the film as he penned each scene. His direction is electrified with bouncing energy while telling the tricky story, allowing the audience to find sympathy with Kane as a character.Grade: A+Rating: 10.5",Null,2,4,6 January 2014
Shakespeare in Love," One of my favorite movies!
","Shakespeare in Love is a film that you can see and feel the brilliance at the very start of the picture and it enchants you to a state of delight. The screenplay is the picture. It's an ideal screenplay that is unexpected to be so enthralling and clever. The film celebrates Shakespeare's life, explores his greatest writing achievements, most obviously being Romeo & Juliet, but other iconic pieces get a few homages. Fiction life imitates art so wonderfully, you could fool a naive man with a claim this was a fact-by-fact biography. Any theater/English influenced person could easily wish this story the way it all actually happened. It uses real-life fact to build the fiction, and it's still a hilarious, romantic movie to watch.Mirroring Romeo & Juliet for most of the film, Shakespeare in Love gets to explore ironies of social issues at the time and the 'truth and nature of love'. This film sets an example to non- artists, an artist's inspiration for their work. One of the easiest routes for producing wonderful writing, music, or paintings is love. Shakespeare in Love is one of the few romantic films that actually is completely successful in capturing love. Some say, you must go back to Shakespeare's original works to acquire great acting or truth in theater or entertainment, and Shakespeare in Love does successfully allow the lead couple act out Romeo & Juliet, but it also sets a precedent that all you need is good writing making romance and narrative just as tantalizing as the classics. A good deal of fun can be had by the audience watching Shakespeare in Love, it's also contains moments of hilarious comedy. But Shakespeare, Romeo & Juliet, and this movie prove Judi Dench's character, Queen Elizabeth, wrong on love, who claim that true love can never be captured in the theater.Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow dazzle in the depth of their strong characters and passionate romance. Paltrow has such powerful charm and lovability behind Viola and Fiennes creates a great depiction of the most popular scribe in history. Judi Dench's cameo is a wonderful addition. The costumes are a degree above other period piece's clothing design, enriched in creativity and elegance. The sets and cinematography are beautiful, the editing breaks down the wall of the viewer's imagination, and its underlined with a romantically epic musical score. The director, John Madden, makes all the risky components of a film with so many intricacies into a sweeping masterpiece, that's hard to sit through without smiling and even harder to leave with tears.

Iron Man 2," Like a drunked party you don't want to go to.
","Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN 2 (2010)It's so disappointing to say that such a smashing film was followed by a sequel that barely knows how to walk let alone run. Every scene is written and cut like the filmmakers said 'Good enough.' Even the most laid back viewer would be able to pick up on Iron Man 2's lazy writing and sloppy arcs. The poor choreography and occasional plot holes create too silly of an environment at times, which is supported by some nauseating dialogue. The whole picture feels like one of the drunken parties we would see in Iron Man 2, where Tony Stark is making an ass out of himself: we don't want to be there when we know the man has so much more to offer. The film doesn't fail completely, mostly due to the bracing visual effects and the hardworking cast of characters. It's wonderful to see Downey Jr., Paltrow, and Johansson work together and collaborate here. The comedy that the first film skated on is only found in the raillery between Tony and Pepper. Justin Theroux wrote the 'screenplay' for this sequel, I think he should stick to acting or learn to pen some narrative flow into his writing.Rating: 4/10Grade: CAnyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. 'I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow' said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.",Null,2,4,5 August 2013
12 Angry Men," Selfishness, laziness, and personal bias
","Eighth grade was my first exposure to 12 Angry Men. My class was reading it as a play, I read the lines of juror number eleven. Shortly after the conclusion of our class read, we watched the film adaptation. I was in eighth grade, I knew it was a great film, but I didn't understand the brilliance of it that I see today. 12 Angry Men's greatest creative strength is the direction- technically. Sidney Lumet has every shot in every scene fitting together creating an effortless flow for the film. However, the greatest weakness the picture has is its hard for the viewer to really settle their inner roots in the it for some reason. The directing doesn't transport our emotions until the second half of the film.The Good Wife produced en episode in their first season titled Doubt. In a show that studies a defense attorney's efforts to create doubt in a jury's mind, the process of the jury members consolations are shown. I thought it was a brilliant move and we should see more media centric things about juries. That episode glimmers with inspiration from 12 Angry Men, but it lacks the morality, mystery, and humanity found in the play. People mistake character development for spending mass amounts of time with a particular character. I believe character development is to I understand a character, the writing and actor thoroughly explain the person on the page to me. 12 Angry Men develops twelve characters in ninety minutes without even knowing their names. As each juror slowly changes their verdict in 12 Angry Men, near the middle of the film I was struck, seeing a metaphor occurring mid-film. It all goes back to politics, the jurors willing to believe that the boy on trial is innocent are the liberals and the men who close their mind to any possibility of innocence represent the conservative party. The jurors who may have been judged for the way they talk, what ethnicity they are, their sexual orientation, or if they were just plain old sensitive were the ones who opened their minds up to Juror 7's campaign to examine the case thoroughly. Now 12 Angry Men still lives back in the days where life was religion-centric and things were one way, and one way one only. This is a move that makes 12 Angry Men ahead of its time. 12 Angry Men is a slice to how a jury actually acts to some extent. The thing they always forget, when their minds are clouded with things in their life they are missing due to their obligation to the justice system, is they hold the fate of another man's life. It's not something that can be taken lightly. Reasonable doubt is mistaken with something that proves the accused not guilty. That's not true and 12 Angry Men shines a light on that discussion. What this film is about to me is the laziness, selfishness, and our personal bias hiding our judgment. We all need to take a step back sometimes and really look at the situation for the gray, not black or white. Even laughing here and there, 12 Angry Men is something that may not be the most fun film to watch, but it's certainly an important to see. Rating: 9/10Grade: A",Null,0,0,1 August 2013
Elizabeth," A Thriller worthy of its subject matter
","Elizabeth surprised me, to be quite honest, because I never thought that a period piece would be made into a frightening thriller, but that it was. Elizabeth's first act of the film, opens with a darkness you would expect to see in a Silence of the Lambs type of film. It's shot with beautifully somber cinematography, a terrifying religious-themed film score, colossal costumes, and using palatial sets, Elizabeth could mistake you for a Shakespeare adaptation of Macbeth or Hamlet.Cate Blanchett is really great in the role, as she's hyped up to be, supplying the film with Elizabeth's raw-emotion and cold persona. Geoffrey Rush is outstanding as the dark character, Walsingham, and Joseph Fiennes makes another memorable character of this era in the same year as the release of Shakespeare in Love. The film, though it delivers an excellent first act and a nice concluding third, the middle section of the lags behind because Elizabeth steps out of the thriller-type genre it was going for in the first 40 minutes and topics the expected marriage controversy with Elizabeth.Sometimes film gets lost in its own reputation, but it still towers as period piece.

L.A. Confidential," A Very Uneven Film, though it holds your attention through the rough moments
","L.A. Confidential is an uneven film, but does succeed on many other levels. The first 20 minutes of the film are very strong, you'll be thinking your in for a good ride. Suddenly, for the next half hour of the film it's uninteresting. It becomes boring with too many characters jumping from crime to crime, character to character, story to story. They just tried to jam pack too much stuff in there. After it hits the 1 hour mark, it's back in top form and draws you quickly in again, making you become invested in the story at hand. It's when the film slows down from its hyperactivity, and strings the many story lines together into one big one. The big problem here is the pace of that 30 minute mark to 60 minute mark. It's not bad (its actually kind of fun), just makes the project weaker in that time. A lot happens and it's very 'talkie', and the film doesn't give the audience a second to breathe and comprehend what's going on.The dialogue makes it a little confusing. It also seems like there is crime after crime after crime, I thought to myself 'Why should I care?' Though, I must say it's the only flaw. After that ridiculous second half-hour, it makes a complete 180 back to where it was in the beginning. The rest of the film was compelling, smart, unpredictable, and thrilling. The audience also becomes even mesmerized into the rest of the film. I must say, the twist and turns are very surprising, like knock you back in your seat surprising. L.A. Confidential has an excellent ensemble. Is ensemble the right word? Many people consider it an 'ensemble piece'. Meaning every character is a supporting character, such as movies like Crash, The Air I Breathe, Inglourious Basterds, etc. I'd beg to differ. The three cops that we follow, I feel would be the leading roles (Spacey, Crowe, Pierce), and everyone else would be supporting. Either way the film has excellent support from it's actors.Kevin Spacey, Im about to call him the Best Actor of the '90s, he is Oscar-Worthy in everything he does. He's so relaxed in the role and charming and cocky. He's the stand-out here. Kim Basinger won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for her work here. Is it deserved? Very. She's great here. Her character is full of mystery and all that makes you more interested in her. Basinger's nuanced performance deserves every positive recognition it got. This was one of Russell Crowe's first performances and to be honest, it's a great breakout. His solid effort avoids the cliché his character was dripping in. Guy Pierce even warms up to you though the duration. Danny DeVito has a small, but memorable role and is as every bit as good as any cast member. So quirky an fun.The tech side of the things doesn't slouch either. The film is beautifully photographed, has lovely costumes, nice sets--especially Kim Basinger's home. It's silky and slinky; beautiful. The score keeps you on the edge of your seat and sets the mood.In The end chase shootout is nail-biting. You also get to see touching couples scenes throughout. L.A. Confidential also has a humor about itself, which makes it a rockin time. There's a gag with Spacey and Pierce with Lana Turner which is hilarious. Great entertainment! Though there may be one bug rough patch, it doesn't ruin the entire film which is technically astonishing, has a suspenseful story, and is well-acted; 8.5",Null,2,6,25 August 2010
Don Jon," #HotGuyProbz
","#HotGuyProbz could be a fitting alternate title to Don Jon, a film that examines a man's complaints about his favorite hobby. Younger men often acquire a reputation of being sex- craving animals. The topic of pornography is on display as blatantly as Mr. Levitt can possibly make it. There's sex, there's boobs, there's Scarlett Johansson's voluptuous figure (Johansson is the Marilyn Monroe of our generation). Levitt's directorial work is focused and carefully executed, while his screenplay is a fun little vehicle. Together those aspects create a mature film about masturbating if there ever was one. The stylized 'man dream' and use of repetition grows tiresome by the conclusion, but you'll be glad you saw the film for its honesty about sex. Mr. Levitt comforts women wanting mature men by telling them that men are capable of growing up and have the ability to love the way they want them to with a little guidance.The cast ensemble is outstanding. Taking the lead role, Levitt acts with great ease and the slickness we know he's capable of. Tony Danza gets a few scenes, which he uses to his make his character wildly memorable. Julianne Moore elevates any film she signs onto, no different here. She's an ally to Mr. Levitt's film; however, at times she is not as quirky as the character is meant to feel. The bulk of Moore's scenes take place as soon as Johansson exits the picture, which may explain my 'friendly-from-a-distance' response to Moore. The film's brightest and most clear star is Scarlett Johansson. Her casting in a selection of her previous films can be thanked to her beauty and sexual aura, not because Johansson was the best choice for the role. Consequently, she often is bland, but here she couldn't be more fresh. She mixes up her usual laid-back beat and jumps on her character with a hilarious accent and embodying the shady side of Barbara's psyche. It's her best performance and may be the reason the film signals a depression once she is no longer predominate to the plot.Grade: B+Rating: 7",Null,0,1,11 October 2013

","I'm going to be perfectly truthful, I didn't understand and absorb all the information that was thrown at me during Tinker Tailor Solider Spy. It's sometimes a mess to keep the characters straight and a struggle to keep yourself engaged, but your forbearance may be worth the pros Tinker Tailor Solider Spy has to offer. It does have an interesting spy story, a mysterious mood orchestrated by the director, and it boasts the performance from Gary Oldman. It's the best male performance of 2011, so naturally filled with a character that has a lot to say. His monologue Oldman delivers is easily the highlight of the film. The technicals are well executed, too, they create a marvelous mood. Tinker Tailor Solider Spy is well directed, contains more- than-quality acting, an interesting story, but for some reason it almost puts you in a comatose state in frequently during its duration.

Crash," A Divisive Report of Bigotry
","As a Best Picture winner, 'Crash' is not often regarded as one of the best. In fact, most rank it at the bottom of the list of any best picture winner from any decade ever. While I understand the concerns with certain aspects of the movie not being up to par, 'Crash' is an important story that deserved to be rewarded for its reporting and unraveling of bigotry, racism and xenophobia of society from shown from multiple perspectives. Brokeback Mountain probably should have won in 2005, but at least the Academy chose to recognize a socially significant film for its Best Picture award.Paul Haggis' execution of the plot is the most divisive aspect of the film, and as each year passes, it feels as if more people ease over to the side of distaste conceding his directing work in 'Crash'. The film's primary problem is that the heavy moments rest at such a high level of melodrama that some feel the direction overdone and cheap. But whenever I think about 'Crash,' the sensory atmosphere Haggis creates remains the most prevalent thing about the movie. The eclectic vibe the film produces launches off the screen. Haggis creates this tone with the camera-work, the editing and the score, which he uses to investigate the ideas in the script.'You think you know who you areYou have no idea.' When Matt Dillon's cop says it to Ryan Phillippe's less experienced character in the police force, it's almost as if Haggis is emblematically speaking to us, the viewers. The screenplay shows sides of its fictional characters that we can recognize in ourselves, and some sides of things we don't want to see in ourselves. Every character—whether black, white, Hispanic, rich, poor, powerful—has a trait for which the viewer can latch onto and turn away from. Though many people who watch 'Crash' probably would not consider themselves bigoted individuals, neither would many of the characters inside the film. But that's the intelligence of the 'Crash': We identify with and admonish every character. There are correlations to 'Do the Right Thing' in the way it explores internal human flaws exist beyond stereotypes. ('Crash' is an inferior film to 'Do the Right Thing,' but they conduct themselves in the same vein and have similar intentions.) The last time I saw Crash was in 2009, and what has remained so active in my mind is the drastic information revealed about the characters, which moves us as the film pivots in its emotionally overwhelming climax. We learn these characters are complicated, as we see them take on the mask of the hero and the villain. While the credits roll, we sit mystified trying to piece together which person deserved or did not deserve our loyalty the most. The character development is enlivened by career-best performances from the epic cast ensemble, with standouts being Matt Dillion, Terrance Howard, Thandie Newton and Sandra Bullock.The idea of interconnecting stories was, of course, a narrative method used in film before, but the way 'Crash' uses it invigorates the process. This type of story structure already divides people, so by adding race politics and a melodramatically unconcealed tone, 'Crash' was doomed to face the brunt of controversy even before it defeated an upscale homosexual love story for best picture.",Null,0,0,13 February 2015
Pan's Labyrinth," Visually imaginative, but won't stand next to The Wizard of Oz in the future
","Pan's Labyrinth has a staggering reputation with film critics and informed moviegoers. Many have titled it as the best film of 2006. I had never seen Pan's Labyrinth before this past week, while I cannot say I'm as enthusiastic about the film as most have been, I do recognize the art that went into making the film and the topics of war that are explored with the accurate grim. Violence is heavily stressed which grinds the audience into certain scenes the film more easily. The main attraction with Pan's Labyrinth is obviously the visuals that are out of this world. Hued with blues and grays for the majority part of the film, the cinematography holds as much beauty and technique that you could find in a painting. The few scenes that contain bright-eye popping colors are made all the more pleasing when they are surrounded by the harsh shades around them. The cinematography glows in the usage of red colors and yellow/gold pallets when those scenes are called for, while they stand for escapism and change from the bloodshed. Fantasy films that require otherworldly characters have been adapted into using computer generated effects or motion capture technology. Those advancements are impressive, but I've always found when an actor is complete in costume and fantasy make-up, a scene plays with more realism, rather than feeling like we are playing a video game. Pan's Labyrinth doesn't succumb to the new trends set by blockbuster action films, instead brings its fantasy characters to life through make-up prosthetics, which are done without a hitch. The labyrinth set itself is like a setting we could find in a fairyland dream that we had, it's a beautifully recognized environment of the film. My problem with Pan's Labyrinth was that it didn't shock me into this world of fantasy right off the bat. I spent most of the movie trying to decipher if Ophelia's scenes with the Faun were reality, part of an adapted view world, or if was her imagination trying to find a sanctuary. It left me in the uninvested for half the film as scrabbled for symbolism that maybe just isn't there. Pan's Labyrinth shows war at face value and a child's struggle to adapt to that brutal environment.Rating: 7Grade: B+",Null,0,5,29 September 2013
Taxi Driver," We're All Lonely
","Watching Taxi Driver made me realize everything I thought I knew about movies was wrong and I had much to learn about film. The truth of my initial viewing is Martin Scorsese's direction dropped me so far into Travis' mind and I never understood any of his actions as wrong. I didn't see him as a vigilante or even insane, I felt his struggles, loneliness, and desire to cure the world of uncivilized people. It was not until I read up on the film after the fact that it hit me, Taxi Driver is a diary of a mad man, not a 'hero's tale.' This led to a magical rush of cinematic brilliance inside me, lined in a sour sorrow that maybe I was crazy because I've been extremely lonely. Maybe everyone's crazy. Are we crazy because we're lonely?We've all felt like that dead animal Travis focuses on as he watches TV, while everyone on the screen dances around the fallen soul. What Scorsese makes of Taxi Driver is not soley educating us about the loneliness we may feel, but presents us with a theory on why we are so lonely: we make ourselves lonely when the lines between what we want and what we can have do not overlap. We try to reach out, but the people we want, do not want us back. There are people that accept us into their lives, even if we surround ourselves with them, we will still feel unfulfilled by the absence of the people we want. This makes us feel unworthy on top of the loneliness.Betsy represents who Travis wants unmutually and Iris is the woman he can literally have, but has no interest in possessing. Using his masculinity, Travis can't extract revenge on Betsy by killing the man she looks up to (the presidential candidate), so he kills the man of Iris he is able to murder (the pimp).Taxi Driver show's Travis' loneliness in two specific acts in the finale: 1) the need to change the world's problems (with the shootout) and 2) wanting to end his miserable life by killing himself. After Travis kills everyone he desired to in the finale to save Iris, he puts the gun to his head and pulls the trigger. The light sound effect of an empty gun brought the biggest gasp from me embedded in intense sorrow and the slight disappoint Travis feels. Loneliness pushes us to extremes that with a fulfilled life we would think we would have to not sink to. Not only is it my opinion that I think this is Scorsese's best film, but I would guess this is one that's most personal to him. In particular with the placement of his cameos 1) by gazing at Betsy, he's acts as Travis 2.0, showing his fascination and love/lust for her. 2) the man in the back of the taxi cab who literally directs Travis on screen to a method of expressing his loneliness through violence. The framing of Scorsese to DeNiro make the director like the 'devil' on the side of Travis' shoulder, telling him to feed into his dark side.Scorsese is aided by Robert DeNiro's portrayal, there's no adjective to describe the superb acting he performs as Travis Bickle. One of the finest performances in cinema, he's a factor that made my first reaction so personal. DeNiro's finest scene is talking to The Wizard outside the coffeeshop. We understand Travis, we've been in his mind, we know what he wants to say, but he struggles to communicate when he tries.The point of view of Taxi Driver is crucial to the brilliance of Scorsese's work. He puts us in Travis' mind and his feelings. To realize Travis's violent, criminal actions fed me food for thought: how do we know if we are like Travis? Inside our own minds, we are the heroes and everyone else is a possible villain. We have a magnificent image of ourselves in our minds, even in Travis' head, we feel victimized by Betsy. However, if we look at the story from Betsy's point of view: Travis is a creepy guy that took her to a porno movie theater and stalks her every move. Can we *really* blame her? Perspective is key here and thinking of this fact may help broaden our minds to accept other people's perspectives, not only our own in everyday situations in real life. During my most recent viewing, I took particular interest in focusing on the heavy use of taxi cabs as symbolism for loneliness. The taxi itself boxes Travis in from everyone him, he's enclosed from the world only able to see what and who is around him never reaching true intimacy. Taxi cabs are yellow, yellow is a color usually associated with being a optimistic, which gives Travis pain as a taxi driver all the more sick. Travis sees New York as a filthy space with evil people. Scorsese makes us feel Travis is driving through Hell, with the company of the vast smoke surrounding the taxi cab. The first shot after the taxi cab entering though the smoke is that of Travis' eyes, full of confusion and fear of the unknown. The symbolism is taken advantage of by the director and cinematography, as well as creating new inspired camera shots.'We are the people,' is the slogan of Charles Palantine, it also becomes the tagline of the film. 'We are the people' unites us all in the universal hopeless feeling of loneliness. It impacts us all, even if the wave hits some of us harder than others. The last shot of Travis looking back into the rear-view mirror tells us that Travis is standing tall at this moment of ignoring Betsy now that she desires him, but the loneliness still lurks underneath the surface.",Null,1,1,9 December 2013
Capote," Two performances guide an above average film.
","If anyone can look me in the eye and say Philip Seymour Hoffman doesn't deserve the trophy on his mantle is delusional. He injects Truman Capote into his body and you never for one second believe you're looking at anyone but Truman Capote. Capote is okay film. It's neither bad nor good, but thanks to the incredible performance form Hoffman and the surprising performance from Clifton Collins Jr., it's worth a view. The storytelling is all right for most of the time, but becomes a drag in some parts leaving the audience picking at the nails or staring into space. There are some well-put together scenes between Capote and Smith. If someone told me that Clifton Collins Jr. would steal one of the most crucial scenes in the film away from Hoffman, I would've said you're crazy. Well, to my surprise he does and it's so powerful and it's the one time during the film when you're 100% mesmerized. The rest of the cast disappoints, including Oscar nominee Catherine Keener. I understand subtlety, but I also understand staring into the camera like you're bored out your mind. She did absolutely nothing for me here.

Lost in Translation," A great film about loneliness.
","Ever see a film or read a book, have so many thoughts about it, but don't know exactly how to put your thoughts into words? That's how I feel about Lost in Translation. I liked it very much, and think highly of it, but just don't know how to describe my opinion of it. Lost in Translation is a mood piece, so isn't that how your supposed to feel after seeing one?It's a very well put together film about two people lost from life and feel alienated. The story is intriguing, showing the audience the towering fears of staying in another country, as well as going through a mid-life crisis. I think it's safe to call this Sofia Coppola's directing and written mantelpiece, earning herself two Oscar nominations for it.Bill Murray shows us his dramatic talents. His performance proves us that he can be more than just Bill Murray the comedian, he can also be Bill Murray the actor. There are a few moments in the script that give Murray the chance to be obnoxious with comedy, but he treats them with delicately. Scarlett Johansson is a few bars above average actress who has never zapped me with a performance before. It seems like she uses the same character approach for each of her characters, except for Match Point and her work here. Both Oscar nomination worthy work. Johansson's role isn't as prominent as Murray's, although both are arguably lead. Scarlett is wonderful here. She has a scene towards the beginning that'll break your heart. It did mine.The clever thing about this picture is that it's not conventional. People think Scarlett Johansson they automatically think of her sex appeal, and that she and Bill Murray are going to have a love affair, no. They are both extremely lonely and sad people, looking to connect with anyone in an atmosphere that's alien to them. Finely crafted mood piece; 8.5-9",Null,1,2,6 September 2010
Interstellar," It will excite, crush, and overwhelm you.
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERSChristopher Nolan has become the most popular director in Hollywood, one who overlaps equally in audience devotion and critical support. Having this popularity is a blessing and a curse: He's given artistic freedom from movie studios who know people will pay to see his movies, but the status of a 'A Film by Christopher Nolan' raises the bar of expectation to unbelievable heights any time he releases a new movie. The setting of his newest film 'Interstellar' is outer space, and from that, comparisons have been drawn to Stanley Kubrick's cinematic masterpiece '2001: A Space Odyssey', which adds even more weight for 'Interstellar' to carry on its shoulders.In the film, earth is becoming an unsuitable place for human beings to live. Dust storms are damaging human health, crops are failing (except corn), and there's an imbalance of nitrogen and oxygen in the air. NASA devises a plan to relocate human life to another region in space. Ex-pilot and current farmer Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) is solicited to leave his children on Earth and lead a voyage through a wormhole near Saturn into another galaxy, searching for alternative planets on which the human race could inhabit. The NASA team of explorers must conclude their mission before everyone on Earth either suffocates or starves, which proves difficult because time moves more quickly in the alternative galaxies.When describing 'Interstellar', the simple terms of 'good' and 'bad' are not enough to accurately assess it. The ambition and scope presented in this film are indescribable. Even if all of the components are not flawlessly carried out, Nolan widens our eyes with his beautiful sense of framing cinematic shots and stretches our minds intellectually farther than any other mainstream film will this year.Unlike 'Inception' and 'The Dark Knight', 'Interstellar' uses leaner action to tell its story, focusing on the characters, the relationships between them, and how the environment impacts their odyssey. The film is not concerned with volcanic gun violence or fistfights; there's a maturity Nolan finds in sensitively telling his existential adventure story.Nolan may be one of our most popular modern filmmakers, but 'Interstellar' is a throwback film to a completely different time. It's produced in the veins of '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Alien', quieter films about characters dealing with their surroundings in space. Nolan is a firm believer in using practical special effects, not CGI. Last year's 'Gravity' wowed the world with its stunning CGI, but 'Interstellar', generated with more old-fashioned special effects, has an organic texture that is not found in most blockbuster films today. The visual elements are extraordinary; each shot is composed of Nolan's deep thought, precision, and imagination.However, 'Interstellar' is maybe Nolan's most blindingly flawed film to date. The first 45 minutes of the movie take place on Earth, and that portion of the film contains overwritten, contrite dialogue that deflates the visuals, acting, and story around said dialogue. Thankfully, this issue dissipates once the Cooper and NASA leave Earth and travel into our solar system. Once they take off into space, the film goes right along with them and soars to stellar levels. Nolan welds his finest scenes with a calmer directing touch and pens the screenplay with affecting themes of love, time, and family bonds.The acting in 'Interstellar' is remarkable and represents the most emotionally rich characters in Nolan's filmography. Matthew McConaughey is the star of 'Interstellar', and delivers a performance equal to his Oscar-winning portrayal in 'Dallas Buyers Club'. He is handed the most sentimental character of his career and kills every moment of it with effortless characterization and gutting emotion. Anne Hathaway and Jessica Chastain portray great, relevant female characters in 'Interstellar' and each actress brings a deep sense of poignancy to her role.Intellectual, ambitious, and visually wondrous, 'Interstellar' displays portions of Nolan's most troubled work but also his most accomplished. It will excite, crush, and overwhelm you.* * * * / * * * *",Null,1,5,12 November 2014
American Sniper," Generic, Ordinary, and Guessable On Top Of Being Racist
","Whether it be the political, racist, or factual debate, most of us probably have not been able to check into our go-to news websites or scroll through our Facebook newsfeeds without hearing opinions being thrown around about American Sniper. I used to love seeing conversation surface around movies, it means the cinema still has the magic to strike a nerve with audience and evoke strong opinions. With movies like Gone Girl, which prompted a conversation between feminist and misogynist interpretations, it is okay because no one was hurt by it. That is not the case with American Sniper. Seeing responses to this film is probably the closest comparison we will get as to what modern audiences would say if 'Birth of a Nation' were newly released in the modern day.American Sniper's hideous ideology is not easy to accept for open-minded individuals, considering Chris Kyle conducts himself in a sexist manner, rejects any notions of thinking in a larger way, and is flat-out racist against Iraquis, often referring to their race of people as 'savages' and 'scum'. The racism inflates each time a line of dialogue is spoken through Bradley Cooper's mouth; you will wince and wish you were watching a different movie. For a Hollywood film to come out so firm with a political and ideological stance is almost as alarming as the racist slurs themselves. The screenplay does not look to criticize or question this aspect of Chris Kyle's personality. Instead it praises him and hold him up as a hero. Yes, this is the probably the only modern-day film that will label someone a hero who is verbally explicit in his bigotry and racism.American Sniper bizarrely boasts its bigotry as patriotism, which is not only disturbing but worrisome. The problem with this aspect of the film is the ugliness that Kyle's ideas of the divide between the 'good guys' and 'bad guys' is encouraging ultra-conservative and zealous patriots to continue using a racist characterization of Iraqis, and if one does not reinforce Kyle's ideology, they are not patriotic. But being uncomfortable, or at least acknowledging, that Chris Kyle had a very dense view of the world and was very racist on many occasions does not equate to anti-military views. I think most everyone would agree that we would not even be having these debates about a movie if it were not for the troops who have defended our country. My grandfather served in the Korean war, so this is not me being, as I've been accused, 'a crazy, America-hating liberal.' I am a liberal who hates that a film ties racism to a heroic image, and that the film breaking records at the box office. (Phrases used in tweets praising American Sniper like 'sand-n*gger' have shaken me to my core.)In addition to the ideology/social impacts of the film, I cannot say that, as a movie, it should be held up as one of the achievements of 2014. I have found this fitting phrase in describing it: a 'knockoff Bigelow film.' American Sniper attempts to be like The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty; it wants to be like Kathryn Bigelow's films like an elementary child imitates the actions of a junior high teenager in attempts to be 'cool'. But like that child, American Sniper just looks silly in its failed attempts.The cinematography is muddy and not very pleasant to look at, unlike those other films. The film editing, though among of the film's better attributes, is looser and less precise than both war films above. And the 'emotional impact' is the horridly fabricated in this film. Not only is American Sniper ineffective in clawing at my heart but actually produces an opposite effect where, because of the terrible dialogue and a horrendous Sienna Miller, the scenes where we see Chris Kyle at home with his wife and family are laughable and cheaply melodramatic.Clint Eastwood's directing of American Sniper is also quite linear. There are no inflections of the story or shades of the protagonist, just a paved-over, flat line of scenes strung together with little human feeling involved. His directing and the overall film are saved from being downright loathsome by the tense action scenes where Eastwood manipulates the audience into those with great suspense and anticipation. My favorite aspect of American Sniper was the straining, articulate sound design, but that's no reason to sit through a film as long and abysmal as this one. If I were recommending movies based on sound quality alone, you better pencil in Transformers: Age of Extinction after your screening of American Sniper.Bradley Cooper received his third acting nomination from the Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts, and Sciences without any precursor nominations from critics or other major award shows, which almost never happens. Cooper has been on a roll lately, giving two great performances directed by actor-friendly director David O. Russell. But here, I feel bit fatigued by his nomination. Cooper is fine as Chris Kyle, but does not warrant an ample amount laudable acclaim. Most of what Cooper is trying to covey as an actor is suffocated by Eastwood and the screenplay's straightforward, dense, machismo portrait of who Kyle was. Cooper seems to be doing something inside grey-space but you'd never be able to know because his vision is not appreciated by the creative team behind him.For military families and fans of the war genre, this will probably tickle your senses in the best ways, but for everyone may be offended by the content...most likely in more ways than one. American Sniper is the generic, ordinary, and guessable war film you would hope it would not be. Heck, even Lone Survivor, which is a B-movie at best, took more daring artistic choices last year than American Sniper does this year.Grade: C-",Null,11,32,24 January 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," A Perfect Adaptation
","An excellent cast ensemble. A funny, intelligent screenplay from fine source material. Great, restrained direction. Fancy clothes. An awesome soundtrack. Fish all that up, stick in a blender and what you get? The sophisticated, 'The Devil Wears Prada'.Anne Hathaway, Meryl Streep, Stanley Tucci, and Emily Blunt headline the picture and all form together and come out with exceptional performances. A surprising uproar of an ensemble. Meryl Streep was nominated in Lead Actress at the Oscars, but this was clearly a mistake. This is Anne Hathaway's movie. She plays the part to a tee, she's beautiful, she makes you identify with Andy as she goes through this torture. Meryl Streep is fierce and cruel as the antagonist. If the studio would've pushed her in the supporting category, she'd have her overdue Oscar right here. Emily Blunt is here in her breakout role. She's the funniest out of the entire cast. Just laugh after laugh and she doesn't have to be obnoxious out it; what an awesome performance. Stanley Tucci adds yet another underrated performance to his resume. The film uses it's source material here and creates something short of masterful. You can watch the picture over and over again because of it's fresh and hilarious story. The director does something genius here. He applies a very gentle touch; it fits. The costumes are dazzling, as well. The Devil Wears Prada is one of the best comedies of the decade.

The Passion of Joan of Arc," Breathtaking Performance in a Religion-Based film.
","Watching a silent film made in the 1920s could be a jaded adjustment for people that are used to the storytelling methods of today, let alone one that abandons a score to aid the visuals. The Passion of Joan of Arc does exactly that, but with a purpose; the filmmakers want to explore a play by play of Joan of Arc's trial without inflicting their opinion onto the film. They urge us to draw our on conclusions on the happenings of the events. In their attempts of doing this, trying to connect with the character of Joan as a protagonist is difficult.The film may have troubles identifying its heroine to the audience, however, the actress portraying the religious figure, Maria Falconetti, bares her soul through the eyes of the character. Never has authentic emotion been more present in a character than in it is Joan. Falconetti creates a stabbing ache in your stomach as you see the pain Joan has survived though and the state of fear she currently lives in.Her performance is most famous for her glaring eyes that stare into space in what feels like every scene. My explanation for Falconetti's exaggeration is Joan's interaction with God (unseen in the film) was so overwhelming, it clouded her view of the world. Now every minute of her life, she sees those images of Him. It's a breathtaking performance that deserves to rank among the best in film history. Carl Theodor Dreyer's mission to create something with is personal stamp of originality is found with The Passion of Joan of Arc's jumbled camera angles. He has thought up each cut, where the camera is placed, and how it contributes to telling this story. We, the audience, are just around to observe what's happening, we're not supposed to feel like a part of the history being told. It's usual editing for such a film.The Passion of Joan of Arc is a religious-based film with a performance that will live on with Joan of Arc's legacy. The Passion of Joan of Arc is uncommon, and should be experienced. It gives Joan of Arc the credit as a Jesus-counterpart in the eyes of God, something that may not be understood to even deeply religious people prior to seeing the film.Rating: AGrade: 9",Null,2,4,8 September 2013
American Hustle," The Best Film of 2013
","It did not take an astronomical amount of time during my screening of American Hustle to realize I had found the best film of the 2013. American Hustle was not what I expected, but in the best way possible. Acting as almost a descendant of Goodfellas, it does not rip off the story or characters, but traces of Martin Scorsese's masterpiece can be found in the style and spirit of David O'Russell's now masterpiece. O'Russell keeps his controlled hand over the wild characters and fast-paced plot; for the crime movie it is, class seems high on the list of 'musts.'The commenters of the screenplay have noted how much of a blast the screenplay is; a blast it is, but most are ignoring the intricacy of the screenplay by David O'Russell and Eric Singer. The groundwork is the twisty fraud story, which is snappy, entertaining, and full of surprises. The next layer is the character work of the five leading roles, the screenplay inflames all the characters to reveal their unique cores. The third layer details those characters each with their own object of symbolism including a comb over, a British accent, hair curlers, nail polish, and a science oven. Layer four is the screwball comedy dialogue exchanges between the characters, which drives comedic artistry out of the actors leaving the audience cheerfully laughing.The most puzzling compliant about American Hustle many are holding against the film is a lack of deeper meaning. It confuses me because the deeper meaning is quite clear and abundantly there, Amy Adams and Christian Bale even have key moments of literally speaking it to the other characters. It's a story of identities, being unhappy with who you are and the different versions of ourselves we put on display as we encounter different people. We have numerous roles we must play in order to survive, whether it be for respect, love, self-worth, or community. We all do it.David O'Russell's sight of his screenplay dares him to capture his film in a particular fashion. The camera acts as a silent third party in scenes of where, if the audience were a character in the movie, our eyes would be during the conversations such as focusing on hand gestures, zooming in to characters as they speak, and the length from the characters to the camera in his editing. Where our focus would be in person is where O'Russell places us in his vision where and when he wants us to see what.The acting ensemble of American Hustle has been called the star of the show, collectively the five leading actors support each other through the two hours and fifteen minutes. Some have found it troubling to select one of the five as the most valuable player because all five do their homework and put the effort in. I anticipated the cast from the trailers and released clips, but I never found myself too terribly excited to see Christian Bale's work, yet he surprised me with how complete his characterization was of Irving Rosenfled. This is a trite way of describing an accomplished acting performance, but Bale warrants it here: I forgot I was watching Christian Bale, the actor, entirely.Bradley Cooper has made a career by unleashing the inner-asshole in himself; in American Hustle he's the ultimate shade of that character type with an added vibrancy and an immaturity of not feeling respected. Jennifer Lawrence oozes in her supporting role filling the juvenile Rosalyn with hilarity and loneliness. Someone who saw American Hustle with me commented on how unlikeable Lawrence's character is and in lesser hands it may have been more predominant, but Lawrence charms her way through her character's flaws and makes us empathize with her entirely. Jeremy Renner delivers great work as well, but with fewer money moments and less 'umph' than his co-stars.The general consensus may have trouble finding an MVP of the cast, but it was no problem for me. Though I admired everything Bale, Cooper, Lawrence, and Renner added to American Hustle, it's an understatement to say the film belongs to Amy Adams. She's proved herself to be a great talent, but Adams delivers her most accomplished work here. In the Hollywood Reporter's Actress Roundtable earlier this winter, Adams commented how miserable she was during the filming of American Hustle because she was so consumed by her character's identity, or lack-there-of. I've never seen a performance like Adams or a character like Sydney. Adams slips in and out of Sydney's faux British accent as she keeps her cards hidden from all the other characters. We never knows who her loyalties belong to. Tears swell in Adams eyes as she pathologically tells the story of her character, without divulging enough information to be completely vulnerable. It's a sensational performance.'The world isn't black and white as you say, it's extremely grey,' a line Christian Bale imparts to Bradley Cooper, another existential message that is driven by the screenplay. O'Russell exhibits his two main characters, con artists, and asks us to like them enough to follow them for rest of the story. By the end, we have not only accepted them, but love and root for them. At the heart of American Hustle is a love story between Irving and Sydney, an aspect that I found to be most successful. Adams is at her most gorgeous ever, Bale is balding and fifty pounds over. Their love is not formed around physical attraction, something magical happens in the first twenty minutes and we see and feel the way they fall in love. This supports the film's stance on appearances meaning nothing. With maybe the exception of Blue is the Warmest Color, try to find two 2013 film characters more in love than Irving and Sydney.",Null,6,12,31 December 2013
The Bourne Ultimatum," Prepare to be stunned
","The Bourne Ultimatum is a fast, smart, rich, fun, and sometimes confusing conclusion to one of the best film trilogies ever made. Matt Damon is back in the title role as Bourne. His performance in all three of these films is Oscar-nomination worthy, but never gets the attention it deserves because it's an 'action role'. Let us hope the Academy will start to see things differently this year with Leonardo DiCaprio Inception role. This would be snub number 3 for Damon. Ultimatum won the Oscar for Editing in 2007, which may have raised some eyebrows because the Editing trophy usually goes hand in hand with the Best Picture trophy. But it is so deserved here. The tension is so high here with suspense; you're biting your nails practically every minute. There are more action sequences here then the other two films, by far, and in he wrong hands could've been overkill, but with the editor keeping it tantalizingly alive it works and creates the atmosphere for the film. Joan Allen reprises her role as Pamela Landy. For all you Pam-fans out there, she doesn't get as much screen time as she did in the second, but when she's on screen Allen works with the material. She hits all the right notes, Joan Allen is just one of the greatest actors in America. Though, Ultimatum is inferior to Supremacy, it's still very close to the excellence. My main problem here was it was a more intricate storyline than the other two films. It's not hard to follow, but if you don't pay attention in that first half-hour, you'll be lost. I think the narrative could've been handled more properly. Other than that.what's not to love? 9.5",Null,1,2,5 August 2010
Fargo," Masterful Mise-en-Scene
","No matter where you start to explain Fargo, it's hard to begin anywhere without 'original' being present in the definition. The Coen Brothers constructed interesting films before Fargo, but this is what really pushed them to the top of the movie world 'food chain' per se and established them as landmark filmmakers. The editing, directing, and writing is molded with a specific vision that is fulfilled on screen.The funny one-liners, repetition amongst characters, and the squeaking accents do draw laughs, but they hardly do justice for the film's originality and brilliance. It's a relatively ordinary setting and characters that are stretched out into a plot that would goes under the microscope and explored in the story in more detail than most films would for this simple set up. Then, once the Coens supply a huge shell to fill with a story, they form a bizarre, satisfying storyline that grows its own mind after taking off in Act 1.A misconception that viewers have about the cinematography of movies is the mise-en-scene has to be visually beautiful, assumed to be found in fantasy films and period pieces. Fargo covers territory of regular landscapes and they are beautiful in themselves, but each shot is thought up and executed to carefully capture something specific. When the cinematography is matched with the near-perfect editing, masterful mise-en-scene results.The supporting characters in Fargo think they have the simple situations they create under control, but the only character who really has a clue is the protagonist (introduced in an unconventional manner), splendidly created by Frances McDormand. In every performance by an actor in film, though all creatively their own, traces from past films often inspire the actors to make certain choices. In the skin of Marge, McDormand doesn't rely on inspiration, she relies on her own creativity.Every character is appropriately acted and drawn out to their full potential, I'm satisfied with everyone's development. William H. Macy humanizes his questionable character with quality to note. I've seen Fargo a good number of times, I've always been aware that it's a great, original film, but I never lived it as I did this past viewing.

Rush," Ron Howard's Baby That Isn't Quite Perfect
","Ron Howard's vision of Rush is an undeniably effective directing job. He puts everything he has in his project and it shows, but Rush isn't a perfect. No matter how beautifully artistic the film was pieced together, I failed to be completely enthralled until Act 3. In fact, I had a different experience with the film in each act. Rush never found a common ground of consistency, even if it's well organized. When the picture started, I was thrown back in my seat by the radical editing and the thundering sound, making some of the year's biggest technical achievements that don't come from Sandra Bullock in space. The film proceeded as I expected a typical sports film would, so no matter excited I got from the brilliance of Howard's directing or the compact editing, I didn't connect or care about to the story. In Act 2, the cinematography popped out at my face and made me recognize the beauty Howard captured on film with the picture. But, I remained untouched and unpropelled by Rush as plot threads began to pile. Give Rush time and it will pay off. Finally Act 3 became the stunning winner that took everything to the next level. The story finally locks you in to caring about the two leading men. This is the time when they finally become humanized and all the themes of the film hit me like Hemsworth's race car would hit anything in his way to glory. The script lets you dissolve into the personal feelings of the characters at this point and Rush becomes a great film.Daniel Bruhl's powers jealousy, determination, and levels tragedy into his role, forming a performance that stands three dimensionally apart from the rest of the cast. The make-up is frigid and ravishing and is another asset to the art in Rush. I have problems with the final scene as it is covered in unnecessary sentiment. It's purpose is to repeat everything we learned for two hours and smile about it instead of letting Rush have a potent conclusion, cutting with the scene before.

Notting Hill," One of the Few Romantic Modern Romantic Comedies that WORK!
","Julia Roberts is the queen of Romantic Comedies. Her iconic role in Pretty Woman should give her the title alone, but she's been in tons, some good while others weren't. However, she chose a good one in Notting Hill. Notting Hill is a sweet, good-natured romantic comedy that succeeds on every level it is trying to be. The story is well-written and more original then it may come off from the trailers. This is a film about movie stars that actually have meaningful conversations about being movie stars. Hugh Grant is also dashing in the leading man role. Roberts actually gives best 'Rom-Com' performance here, aside from the Oscar-Nominated, Pretty Woman. She restrains herself and isn't loud or obnoxious, just true to the character. This is some of her most underrated work. With beautiful shots of London and a sweeping romance, Notting Hill is an example for future romantic comedies. I only had one problem: there is a huge gap in the middle where Roberts is off in America. I understood it was important to the story, but it didn't have to last 20 minutes. This is her story as much as it Grant's, but the writers put her on the back-burner. While the ending is predictable, it's sweet and makes you smile. Wonderful film; 8.5",Null,13,14,21 July 2010

At the most basic level, you hopefully will not leave 'Nightcrawler'unfulfilled from the lack of swerving action and investment in the result of the story. I found myself pierced viscerally by 'Nightcrawler', its stark nature, and how far it pushes its issues. After the final round of scenes conclude, you are permitted to release your breath and feel exhilarated by what you just saw. The eerie tone is generated from the morosely marvelous visuals, photography that maneuvers through the darkness like second nature, and the disturbing directing from Dan Gilroy. 'Nightcrawler' examines the news field but is emblematic of today's job market and the difficulty one faces when trying to maintain a decent wage and a fulfilling life. It's a harsh critique, but a subtextual critique that feels connected to the the times of today.

Man of Steel," Movie of Eyerolls
","'I wanna roll my eyes right now, but the doctor said if I keep doing it, my ocular muscles might spasm and eject my eyeballs,' Liz Lemon says in an episode of 30 Rock. I would advise Tina Fey to stay far away from the new Superman movie because that is all that awaits you on the other side of the theater door: eye roll after eye roll. By the third act I wished my eyeballs would eject from my skull. In an honest world, Man Of Steel should have been renamed Movie of Eyerolls.After The Dark Knight Rises concluded Christopher Nolan's classy Batman revival series last summer, fans didn't fall into despair, for they were suffocated with the initial Man of Steel trailer upon each showing of The Dark Knight Rises, with everyone's favorite director's name plastered as a 'producer'. Anyone could've guessed that Man of Steel was going to fall below The Dark Knight trilogy's quality, but I didn't even expect it to be as bad as it actually is. Clearly, the genre has not learned a thing from Christopher Nolan.Man of Steel is piled with bad dialogue, unfulfilling characters, and leaden visuals that never satisfy your eyes. The script has decent intentions, but the final product feels like a slapdash effort by the screenwriter. Many times, I asked myself 'Are they really going to go down this route, really?' There is some effective aspects of a superhero tale, but most of the time it gets lost with making 'spectacular action' that it uses clichés to fill in the gaping holes left by the characters and plot arcs. The beginning shows an idea was entirely drawn, though it's explored, it never feels as interesting as it should be. The dialogue is awful, but David S. Goyer does supply one memorable quote that hits you like a bullet: 'People are afraid of what they don't understand.' I hope, Man of Steel is a simple-minded movie, with no greater meaning, because if it does have a greater meaning, we know it will go the religion route. If that point ever came, I wouldn't wait for my eyerolling to eject my eyeballs, I would gouge them out myself with my movie ticket.Misdirection is accounts for most of Man of Steel's issues. Zack Snyder brings not much else except pretension to the table, therefore fails to shine light on the humanity that lies within the story and characters. There's countless of attempts at bringing the 'man' to 'Superman', all that the movie has to show for it is embarrassment. Most the film is told in unbridled periods of action it's not enough to satisfy the audience and their craving to know these characters. The action sequences are proficient and they improve in the second half. I'm not crazy about the technical aspects of Man of Steel. Sure the special effects and the sound design are give-ins that deliver, but the editing and cinematography are huge letdowns. The look of the film is unappealingly murky. I did really take to the new Superman costume, it updates the classic outfit comfortably. I'm not really sure if Man of Steel was motivated to be driven by the character of the man behind the 'S' (which interestingly means peace in this movie) or if it's epicly driven by the destructive plot, but either way the movie hardly ever advances because the lack of development with its characters or actors. Leave it Diane Lane to supply the first and one of the only touching moments in the story. Lois Lane is the most intriguing character in the movie, but Adams doesn't try to break new ground with her even though she has audience's accessibility on her side. The characters are run-of-the-mill and fail to enter our hearts. Man of Steel hoodwinks the audience into believing that it's a thoughtful origin story that takes itself seriously. When an action movie fails technically, you know the movie is in trouble. In fact, I had the uneasy feeling like I was watching a straight-to-DVD, low budget horror movie during my two and a half hours with the new Superman. There are too many clichéd attempts at being a profound, character piece. If the movie we got is the movie sci-fi nerds and fans of the advancing work in this genre have been anticipating in Man of Steel, then the movie industry is in trouble. I walked out of the theater with haunting thoughts of an apocalyptic business down the road where originality and art are dried up.",Null,2,5,5 July 2013

Very good, funny script, but I think it tries too hard at times. Even with some cheesy plot points in the script, the direction makes it realistic (in the present). The acting is terrific from the entire ensemble. Steve Carrell steals the show here. He's used to the obnoxious comedy we see on The Office, but he dials down here and turns in a fantastic performance that should have been nominated at the Oscars instead of Arkin.

I couldn't focus on what was being shown to me on the screen, something about the story was off-putting, even the directing didn't settle with me at first.

Some of the stunts are incredible and the magnitude is just bigger and better than what was in movies at that time. It's Hitchcock's biggest film; it's not bloated, but it covers the territory necessary to best an iconic action thriller. Hitchcock stages everything well here, making the action feel innocent enough to not fall into the 'Action Movie' stereotypes of today clichéd blockbusters.

There are some who are proclaiming it as one of the best action flicks of the year (Roger Ebert's 4 Star Review) and others who are saying it's just another mind-less action flick. The first 45 minutes are outstanding. They were written, acted, and directed on spot, in my opinion. There was mystery, action, thrills and chills. The second half gets more into the story, usually that would be a good thing. Here, it's not. It's writing moves way too fast, becomes preposterous, confusing and just downright sloppy at times. However the director does the best that he can and salvages some of the ridiculousness that comes with the second 45 minutes, with the help of a solid, consistent performance from Angelina Jolie. The cinematography, sets, visuals, sound all bring to the table to come out with a fine action thriller. If the script would've continued to develop it's characters and story I'd probably be giving it a higher score, but because of the second half I can't give it a glowing recommendation. Still, the entire film keeps you entertained from credits to credits; 7.",Null,2,6,28 July 2010
Face_Off," Unforgettable
","Face/Off is an action picture in every sense of the word. Too many over the top chase sequences? Check. Too-long running time? Check. Nicolas Cage? Check. Bad? No possible way. It's a seasoned original action picture with surprisingly great performance, excellent sound, editing, and visuals, and nail-biting thrills. Nicolas Cage, possibly the king of action pictures shares the stage with john Travolta and together they have more chemistry than 3/4 of the romantic comedies today. It's a Clairice Starling/Hannibal Lecter pair. Can you imagine if Jodie Foster and Anthony Hopkins did what Travolta and Cage do here, switch faces? That would've been interesting. Both deliver to my surprise, terrific performances. Travolta pretty much amazed me here. He has emotional depth for both characters he portrays. It's Oscar nomination work that never gets considered because of the nature of his film (i.e. Matt Damon in Bourne). Both men could've stolen the show in the Nicolas Cage role, and they both are sublime in it. But it is the John Ttravolta character that was the challenge. When Travolta is actually in his original character he's just as solid and great as he is in the Cage character. Cage falls a little behind with Travolta's character, but picks himself up when he confronts Joan Allen. From there on he's on Travolta's level. Joan Allen, I fell like I talk about her in every review, delivers yet another fantastic performance. How does she do it?Face/Off is features incredible tech stuff, fine acting, a very original (not always believable) script, and the action may carry on for a while, but it very well-done; 8.",Null,4,6,6 August 2010
Ratatouille," One of the Finest Animated Features this side of Beauty & the Beast

The script is funny and original. The direction is right on. The editing keeps it at a fast-pace. The sound is amazing. It's beautifully drawn. It's near perfection. But, because it's an 'animated' film, it wasn't voted in for Best Picture of the Year at the Oscars, which it deserved. My only tiny problem is that maybe it was just 15 minutes too long? Other than that it's wonderful. There is also an interesting little section in the film, about film critics that Pixar nailed with the writing.

X-Men: Days of Future Past," Holds some of the most poignant, intense, and copacetic scenes of the year so far...who would have known?
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERSI never cared much for the 'X-Men' film series with their silly transformations and 'cool' special effects, but I found myself intrigued and captivated by the latest installment, 'X-Men: Days of Future Past.' Bryan Singer returns to his role as director and pursues a deft vision that translates to a clean, organized superhero flick. 'Days of Future Past' both stands as a staple of technical adeptness and shoots gratifying bullets of adrenaline for those paying for the entertainment. The screenplay avails its twisty concepts, fastens tight a sturdy structure, and wins the audience's interest with a developed plot. Its swift beating tone keeps the project going at an advanced, adaptable rhythm. An 'X-Men' movie holds some of the most poignant, intense, and copacetic scenes of the year so far...who would have known?The creative and technical team behind 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' climb to the brim of quality action filmmaking and maintain high standards throughout the two hour film. The film editing is the first thing noticed in opening fight sequence, a scene which made me sit back in my seat and mumble 'wow' to myself as at the sharp, charged cuts. The art department showcases pleasing neon blue and purple colors that contrast with the ample black space in the scenes taking place in present time, which flatters the look of the film.'Days of Future Past' reminds me in more than a few ways of Christopher Nolan's monstrous 2010 hit 'Inception.' An action film that takes itself seriously and respects the sanctity of the motion picture process are most basic ways the two films are alike, but specific aesthetic features and narrative structure overlap between them as well. It's as if Singer and company had a group viewing of 'Inception' before beginning preproduction and used the Academy Award winning film as its muse. The way it is written (multiple time dimensions, the plot hinging on a ghostly femme fatal from the past), cut (aligning time periods action scenes), and shot (Quicksilver's racing speed distorts gravity as Arthur's gravity-less hotel sequence from Inception) all breathe like an homage to 'Inception,' which is a complimentary observation.The vastly talented array of A-listers entertain and revel in their characters effortlessly. With pretentious egos aside, the actors to deliver the resilient superheroes in full form. Hugh Jackman, while not very complex, relishes in leading the pack as Wolverine, Jennifer Lawrence adds another valuable blockbuster to her resume as Mystique, and Michael Fassbender coerces blood into Magneto. James McAvoy is the acting standout by threading Professor Charles Xavier with a sore backstory. It's impressive to see the cast in the film, even with these crucial four aside, for just the sake gathering so many highly regarded thespians into one genre picture.The exorbitant fan expectation is just as high as they were for the first sequel in 2003, yet after seven films X-Men surmounts any conjecture surmised by eager fans. 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' may sound like a drag (literally, the title sounds reductive and crude), but it's a technical marvel with an absorbing story and characters.Rating: 7.8Grade: A-",Null,0,1,4 June 2014
The Usual Suspects," A rewarding film with one huge rough spot.
","The Usual Suspects is one of the best thrillers of the 90s. It's very rewarding, especially with the huge twist in the end. Visually, it's stunning. The cinematography, the sets, the action is all meshed together, but in a good way. Though the story and direction seem to be on spot, there is one HUGE moment at the 20-25 minute mark that the narrative switches paths. It's done horribly. It confused the heck out of me and probably did most people. I had absolutely no clue what was going on for a minute there. I'm not sure if it was the script or the director who complicated it, but it certainly didn't function. That being said, the story (other than the plot point I just mentioned) is extremely well-written. It pulls the rug out from under you in the end, after already pulling a 'Trick Twist'. It's wonderfully done. There are some very suspenseful moments in here as well. The ending especially. The acting is incredible. The ensemble is wonderful, but can't hold up to what Kevin Spacey does in this film. He is downright electrifying. The film's huge flaw will test some audiences, but Spacey is just sublime here; 8.5- 9.",Null,0,0,26 July 2010
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Ridiculing, Cheap, but Entertaining
","The theater in which I saw The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug seated over 300 people and it was completely filled, not an empty seat in the house. What did that cause? Humidity, claustrophobia, and distractions. The viewing experience mirrored the film we were watching. Though it improves from the first chapter, The Hobbit Desolation of Smaug feels suffocating and prolonged, the tone becomes an object of ridicule (who knew the legacy of the-end-of- the-world trilogy that was Lord of the Rings would be reduced to the unserious nature of The Hobbit trilogy?), and extremely cheap (remember when Fellowship of the Ring won Best Cinematography, clearly Desolation of Smaug forgot).The film does benefit from the short-lived presence of Gandalf played magnificently by Ian McKellen, but even his lines have evolved from deep thoughtfulness to reactions of slapstick comedy. McKellen has a charm as Gandalf that Marlon Brando created with The Godfather that soothes the viewer, that is what makes these characters iconic.The hours of set building, CGI construction of Smaug, costume designing, and make-up work seek through the emaciated screenplay and the farce tone. If There and Back Again retains the same tonal treatment, maybe the studios should submit it to the Golden Globes as a Comedy/Musical with a nostalgic campaign of the original trilogyGrade: C+Rating: 5",Null,0,2,31 December 2013
Before Sunset," A flower, that was grown by the seeds of life, and blossoms into love and happiness.
","The Before trilogy is a unique piece of cinema that is one of the most enchanted stories I've ever seen, yet I've probably never seen a fictional depiction of love ever expressed so genuinely or realistically. Before Sunrise was not a Box Office smash by any means, being independently made as well, it's kind of shocking that it spawned two sequels. But this is one of the rare times in our society a sequel was put into production because the audience they spoke too wanted more for the intellectual stimulation and embracing romance. It reached to a section of fans and critics ate it up. Thankfully, the team came backing punching the audience more with each film.'Stupid people talk about people, averagely smart people talk about things, intelligent people talk about ideas.' This quote has always fascinated me and is held true in each of the Before movies. Topics discussed here is what people should be talking about, not the latest petty gossip in their circle of friends. The key to total connection in a relationship is the talking about the mysteries of the world, human nature, and one's personal beliefs; that's what all three Befores cover beautifully. The trilogy's most pure nature is a collection of conversations between two people developing a romantic relationship through what they learn about each other. The dialogue was so engrossing that the entire first hour flew by and I hadn't written a single note on my legal pad. A movie where practically nothing happens would sound like a bore in theory and could even be a disaster in the wrong hands, but here it captivates the viewer.Each conversation the couple has, I identified with their thoughts; they may have been ideas I had at one time, a conversation I actually had with someone else, or something I've never thought of before that makes total sense about love, life, and personal psyche. This is what a great love story should be. This is what a great movie should be. This is how a great movie representing the building of a romantic relationship should be. The truth is, love means different things to us at different stages of our lives and the different stages of a relationship change the mood of said relationship, which is why all three movies make sense and are necessary.Before SunsetThe series does mature with its characters. Before Sunset entirely takes place in the matter of an hour and half, almost told in real-time, making the experience even more fulfilling. The characters begin to see the darkness of the world and the mess of their lives is deep territory the romance series dives into, but it only makes them and their brilliantly written conversations feel more real. The poetry in Before Sunset is arresting within each shot, each word, each moment is ravishing. This is the most visually alluring film to watch and the most abstract to think about. The conversations are probably at their deepest analytically covering failures of life, regret, and the possibility of love that never dies.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+Watching character dive head first into conversations about life has never been so mesmerizing as it is in the Before trilogy. Communication is something lacking in society today, the Before trilogy shows us how a successful relationship is built: through talking. Julie Delpy and John Hawkes are transform into their roles and especially knock their performances over the fence in the last two films. The collaboration between two leading actors and the director, Richard Linklater, writing the later films results in a tightly told story that unfolds without fault. One thing that marks these films different from most lack of cuts within a scene. Many scenes in the Before trilogy run un-interrupted for ten minutes or more. It's very hard thing to do, but it's done with natural grace. With Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight we feel closer to life, love, and ourselves. The Before trilogy is like a flower, that grew by the seeds of life, and blossoms into love and happiness.",Null,0,0,30 July 2013
The Grand Budapest Hotel," An amicable episode of Anderson's immigration
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERSWes Anderson is a filmmaker whose touch is so distinctively defined in atheistic and a deviously aberrant tone that his work could be picked out a pile of miscellaneous films by a blindfolded crowd. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is an amicable episode of Anderson's immigration. His exquisite visuals and fragrant tone may not be compatible for some, but thankfully the latest chapter of the auteur's diary internalizes most of its idiosyncrasies instead of besieging them onto the audience.Most of the heat encompassing 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is flowing from way of the screenplay (which is surprisingly derived from preexisting material), but I actually found Anderson's directing to be better than the script, which is not meant to discredit the writing. Anderson's tenacious vision for each and every mise-en-scene frame is ornamentally ravishing. Approximately 80% of the film is built with a centerpiece of the frame and everything behind that person or object in the setting is symmetrically detailed. The mechanical brilliance of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is assembled by Anderson's tumultuous approach.The plot does not hesitate to run on its ridiculous occurrences, which is why the film is able to pliably undergo Anderson's robotic editing style effectively. The score wonderfully adds to the uniqueness of the images on screen and is what captures most of the comedic moments, such as the blueprint-planned prison escape.The production values live up to the majestic bar set by Anderson's previously released films, such as the costumes, which are construed with bursting pigments and cinematography that captures hues of light that skillfully flicker the magic of the scenes.The massive impact of the film does not end with visual decadence. The lofty cast is a collection of some of Hollywood's most prolific actors including F. Murray Abrahams, Adrien Brody, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Saoirse Roan, Tom Wilkinson, Tilda Swinton and most importantly Ralph Fiennes. The miracle of so many actors signing on for limited roles is impressive enough, but to synchronize such varying talents into a single spirit is a delight to watch. Fiennes does most of the heavy lifting as M. Gustave, forthrightly witty, but humorously proper.The one place Anderson does not completely rival the aspects from past films is the personable attachment to the characters like what he achieved in 'The Royal Tenenbaums.' Here, his focus is redirected to the method of telling a story, rather than character exploration, which is forgivable. He plays with motifs and overarching plot devices instead of building layered characters. The infamous 'Boy with Apple' painting acts as a somewhat macguffin for 'The Grand Budapest Hotel,' a priceless painting bequeathed to Ralph Fiennes' M. Gustave by Tilda Swinton's cameo role of Madame D., which stays locked in a safe for acts two and three, but dictates most of the action in film. A sense was in the air that Anderson was possibly using the painting as a parallel to the film itself: an artistic marvel that is not fully realized until the story is complete. Another self-referential symbol of the pungent film is in the sugary, perfectly bundled Mendel pastry cakes.Modulated with the expected stylish chapter/title cards and the amusing eccentric dialogue, Wes Anderson has assembled what is sure to be one of 2014's most genial illustrations. 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' wins over the audience with the fastidious direction, the symmetric set design, Fiennes's comically deferential, deliciously blunt performance, and the accessibility derived from being immune from an overdose to Anderson's usual method.Grade: B+Rating: 7.6",Null,0,6,28 April 2014
Foxcatcher," Haunts with Uneasy Themes and a Deliberate Reveal of Information
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERSHearing reactions from people who saw 'Foxcatcher' made me instill a mindset in myself to defend against the 'slow pacing'. (Feeling the discomfort from a long running-time is a movie pet peeve of mine.) However, my experience of 'Foxcatcher' was largely different from most everyone else who has discussed the film. I did not want to take my eyes off the screen. The direction from Bennett Miller felt in tune with the story and the characters in a mellow way. He built scenes at a gradual pace, but each scene has a path and reach a distinctive point of impact. Because 'Foxcatcher' is so muted, it haunts with the uneasy themes being explored in the screenplay and a deliberate reveal of information in the directing.The ominous representations of the real-life people by the actors contribute substantially to the outcome of 'Foxcatcher'. Steve Carell amazed me in his portrayal of John du Pont. It's not the most expressive work of an actor this year, but it's certainly one of the most potent. The comedic actor is transformative and in more ways than the physical ones prompted by the make-up prosthetics, which visibly add to the creation of the mysterious figure. Carell's eyes cut deep into the viewer and sting like a sharp razor blade impaling the warmth of your flesh.'Foxcatcher' begins as Mark Shultz's story and continues into the film's second act led by Channing Tatum's irate temperament. But the closer the end of the film nears, du Pont begins to consume the story. Carell's performance feels extraordinarily subtle as your start the film, but as 'Foxcatcher' endangers the viewer deeper into du Pont's mind, the severity of Carell's performance begins permeate throughout the picture. There's an eerie presence he creates, a torment that does not internally leave you after watching it. (Not to suggest that du Pont is evil, as understood in Miller's direction, there's an nuance of tragedy that looms over the man that makes his story such a grave one to experience.)Mark Ruffalo's Dave Schultz becomes a driving figure in the last act, along with Carell, as Tatum's importance begins to lessen. The simple, small-town guy with a beacon of knowledge realized by Ruffalo is impressive. Tatum also gives his most accomplished performance to date.Bennett Miller steps back tonally to his work in somber 'Capote' after making the lighter (and forgettable) 'Moneyball' in 2011. 'Foxcatcher' is in the same quality league as 'Capote', but in film he has a peculiar manner of creating the action of the plot. Some may say 'Foxatcher' contains too few and far between events in the narrative, but I think Miller creates a drama palpable in the air of every scene, and we, the audience, are parked in a burning tension for two hours.'Foxcatcher' is a superb film that, as it sits in your mind, grows from the seeds Miller plants in your head as you watch his detailed recounting of events on the du Pont estate. It will disturb you with its bleak vegetation and seduce your flames of darkness.Grade: A-* * * 1/2 / * * * *",Null,37,59,30 December 2014
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Like a fortune cookie.
","From the piercing sound effects of the swords, to the beauty in the sets and costumes, and the folksy-Chinese-proverb-esque music, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon is a visual feast. The cinematography pops the color out of the sets like flowers in a Chinese garden, but philosophical questions are a constant output by the film's characters. Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon also benefits guidance from it's excellent performance of subtleties by Michelle Yeoh.This may be an earlier effort, but with Ang Lee's name on the director's title, we know we're in for kicked-visual ass and a strong hand in the truth on the page of the screenplay. Lee does the famous fight scenes justice with poetry and ballet mannerisms surrounding the startling violence and precise choreography. The screenplay draws interesting parallels between its two primary couples and remixes the an Asian-Western feeling amongst the romance. Some of the scripted lines are like opening a new fortune cookie every ten minutes with insightful meaning. An example: 'Whatever path you decide to take in this life... be true to yourself,' and 'There is nothing we can hold onto in this world. Only by letting go can we truly possess what is real.'Problems arise, however. Some of the other dialogue in the script feels like it was generically selected from soap operas, which doesn't lessen the script's highs, but certainly creates some inconsistency in the quality. During the fabulous sword fighting scenes, a distracting element is the fantasy brought to the table. I know it was fantastically intentional, but the character's embodying Superman's ability to fly does acquire an eye roll here or there, especially with its final act. A tonal alteration at the start of Act 2 abruptly changes the course of the story, which could cause momentary vertigo.Because the main character does so much to compromise our view of her moral actions, the film drives an open to interpretation opportunity. Ang Lee believes in her, but wants us to believe in her on our own terms. The topic of liberation is exposed to the audience a good number of times before the finale, through conversations that literally discuss it. It's the vital ingredient to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon that poses a question for the ending, as well as an emotional sting.Rating: 8Grade: A-",Null,0,0,1 November 2013
Gone Girl," Exceeds the established expectations of crime thrillers.
","Gillian Flynn published a book titled 'Gone Girl' in 2012, which soared to the New York Times bestseller lists, captivated critics, and invigorated audiences across America. As anyone would assume from the commercialized system of entertainment, 'Gone Girl' was developed into a motion picture. Flynn wisely adapted her own novel into the screenplay, and director David Fincher accepted the mission of satisfying the zealous fans of the novel. Thankfully, Fincher has been successful in making a movie that will permeate through cinemas just as the novel did through bookshelves.On their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) returns to their quiet suburban home in Missouri to find his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) has vanished from their home and the only clue left to her disappearance is a messy crime scene suggesting a struggle. Did Nick kill his wife? Is he holding her hostage? Was Amy murdered by someone else? If so, then by whom? These are the questions that plague police, reporters, and spectators when assessing Nick's apathetic attitude to the situation and the contradictory evidence that emerges.The first act of 'Gone Girl' is told from two different perspectives: an objective view of Nick dealing with ramifications of Amy's disappearance and a subjective telling of the love story before Amy went missing, told from Amy's perspective via her diaries. The film functions sufficiently through this period, sometimes it even transcends, but the sharp turn 'Gone Girl' takes in its second act discombobulates the viewer. Subsequently the film prospers. By act three, 'Gone Girl' pushes every boundary imaginable, and the final turn of events will not abate from your mind for hours after leaving the cinema.Within the spear-edged twists of the screenplay lies a mordant stand on probing themes of husband and wife dynamics, marriage deceit, and the fabrication of ideas of being a 'celebrity.' One of Amy's first diary entries begins with Amy underlining this sentence: 'Marriage is hard work.' 'Gone Girl' asks the question in the most extreme case scenario, do any of us truly know the person who sleeps next to us? The screenplay presents its leading characters in a reticent way, both guarded and unwilling to compromise. The strength of this approach supplies the film with depth because neither character is entirely sympathetic, both have their explicit flaws, and each are mired together in marital issues beyond repair.David Fincher directs 'Gone Girl' with the same storytelling standard he has brought to 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,' 'The Curious Case of Benjamin Button,' 'The Social Network,' 'Zodiac,' and 'Se7en.' There is no question who made this film. Fincher's lark auteur touches are on maximum display in 'Gone Girl,' and are just as crafty as ever. He adorns his take on the heralded novel with his typical, but ever so effective, scratching, toned score and somber darkly-lit cinematography.Everyone seeing 'Gone Girl' is probably familiar with Ben Affleck in some capacity. He's swell as Nick Dunne. However, most people seeing 'Gone Girl' are probably inexperienced with the British actress Rosamund Pike, but after seeing this film, everyone will know her name. Not only does she have one of the most tremendously written female characters in recent years, but she performs it without a blemish. Pike is eager to summon the terrifying Amy Dunne, and the product is a bravura piece of acting.If you have never taken any of my opinions on film seriously before, take this one. I plead that you see 'Gone Girl' because it is a cinematic experience that needs to be lived. The echelon of talent from Fincher, Affleck, Pike, Flynn, Jeff Cronenweth, (the cinematographer), Kirk Baxter (the film editor), Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross (the composers) make this an inconceivably good film, which exceeds the established expectations of crime thrillers.* * * * / * * * *Grade: A",Null,2,7,18 October 2014

The Theory of Everything," An Unremarkable Film with Fetching Assets
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERSEvery year there are one or two films that score major nominations throughout award season that are not particularly special, and they manage their accolade success by appealing to older voters and not taking many risks. Usually, films of that nature can be appreciated for style, performances, and consistency. 'The Theory of Everything' is 'that' film this year, but it's not as easy to appreciate as typical period piece Oscar films.'The Theory of Everything' is most notable for its beautiful cinematography. It pleases our eyes with strong, radiant colors such as blues, golds, greens, and browns. There is also a fine texture to the photography, as if a painter swiped gloss across the lens, which produces a beautiful, faded look. To put sound with the visual, the charming musical score composed for 'The Theory of Everything' is an invaluable component in the film's areas of success. Without it, the film would fall flatter than it occasionally does. In addition, Director James Marsh envisions the project on a smaller scale, as if he was holding all the components in his hands when he filmed it. The directing makes the screenplay's lacking scope excusable. Marsh makes everything fit nicely as one commodity. On paper and at first glance, this looks like a role of a lifetime for Eddie Redmayne, and even though the writing does not allow this to be an overwhelming performance, Redmayne fades into Hawking's fight. Assertive in the beginning and subtly crushing in the later scenes, Redmayne uses his physicality and emotions to play the part as ably. Felicity Jones is his leading co-star, and she's splendid but, like Redmayne, nothing to note in the history books.Simple and harmless, the surface is the limit in 'The Theory of Everything'. It has a subject matter and a pretense of something emotionally draining and three-dimensional, but the opposite could not be more true of the film in front of you. The film fails to affect the slightest bit of emotion onto its audience, and the awkward part is the numerous moments where the film thinks it is being absorbing and engaging and it's not. The characters begin to weep, waiting for us to join in with them, and we end up just uncomfortably staring at the frame. Instead of grabbing our emotions, the misfortunes of the characters instead grab our distanced, unemotional sympathy.Though the directing should be looked at with blame for this, the script is even more responsible for the film's troubles in this area and for its general problems. The dialogue is unorganized, the ideas decides not to reach farther than what would be appropriate for junior high school audiences, and the screenplay tells this story in the most basic way possible. In fact, the best scenes in 'The Theory of Everything' are the montages where we just watch the characters be instead of listening to poorly written dialogue. (The montages rely on the acting, musical score, and directing more than anything which is why they work so agreeably.)An unremarkable film with some fetching assets.Grade: B",Null,3,5,24 November 2014
Frozen," Depicts love in the modern age
","With a smile on my face, I can say I finally sat through Frozen tonight. I turned off my phone and left aside any note-taking, just absorbed the film for entertainment and on that level, it succeeded on happily keeping me interested. Who doesn't love classic Disney animated musicals? With my short attention span, as I child I bounced from one film to the next singing along and rooting for the happy endings. Frozen hits the refresh button on the classic beat-bopping fairy tales. Pixar has defended the honor of animation for the past decade, but Frozen makes me thankful that children of this day-and-age will be able to have the same childhood memories I had. When the film began and the first song was belted among ice-workers, a feeling came over me and I thought, 'this is the Disney I know.'Frozen's iced snowy visuals sparkle with the beauty we expect every year from the Christmas season and the costumes are drawn with a cool-bite. Like any animated film you'll find, there are the occasional unavoidable gags that are intentionally written for laughs from the target audience.The melodious songs enchant the viewer and draw jumbles of enjoyment from the children in our hearts. The Oscar nominated song, 'Let It Go,' blows its notes like wind from a hurricane. The characters are etched out with their wings spread, in particular the two central sisters and their relationship, with the voice working pitching the tones of the animations with ease. The characters are given distinct personalities, traits that are compatible with the modern era, and will hopefully separate them from future Disney characters. I had a bold, reoccurring thought during Frozen: this may be the most liberal, intelligent, and humanly-vast of any of the Disney musicals. The olden Disney musicals, bless them and all their brilliance, show love quite superficially compared to the execution Frozen puts out. A prince will not be perfect and love requires us to be accepting of flaws that are eventually revealed. Walt Disney Pictures have taken a commendable step in what they subconsciously teach their younger demographic about love and romance. Cinderella, Snow White, and Aurora did not have adequate time to fall in love with their princes, so how did they know it was love? Frozen says with a firm statement the thing adults tell teenagers persistently (even though teens refuse to believe the wisdom), 'you don't know what love is.' Nothing is taken away from the romances those classic princesses, Frozen clarifies the modern definitions of love.Frozen sets certain examples that will hopefully sink into the mindsets of some of the future youth. The evolution of our society and feminism take even further steps in the adaptable emotion of love, the painful effects of isolation, and also refusal to accept of one's flaws. Frozen's modern depth and insights relieve me from dooming it a pleasurable animation. Grade: ARating: 8Stars: 4/4",Null,4,7,3 February 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Continues the trilogy with VERY long action scene...but with a BANG!
","It's not completely easy to sit through a 3 hour movie, with at least one-fourth being action scenes. But with Peter Jackson's signature touch it works magnetically. It's visually intoxicating, there are some moments where you're pushed back in your seat gawking at the screen trying to get the word 'How?' between you lips. It's the second chapter from the legendary trilogy novel, and it's a magically entry in the landmark series in film history. Though it's a filler between 'The Fellowship of the Ring' and 'The Return of the King', it stands by itself as a iconic film. Like I've said before, you'll be wowed by what you see. Dazzling visuals here--especially Gollum. The sets are unbelievingly rich and detailed. The cinematography is so beautiful, the photography looks like it could be featured in an art museum. The costumes are wonderful, as they were in the first film. Special effects had never been put to better use anywhere else, than here. Oh my goodness are the only words you'll be thinking. It's incredible what happens here whether it's computer generated or not...it's believable. It's worth seeing for that reason alone. Ian McKellen's well-known role of Gandalf is minimized from the Fellowship, but McKellen does what he can with what's given to him, as usual. Besides, it'd be hard to top his original portrayal. It's one of the best the cinema has ever had. Gandalf's fate from the mysterious and misleading disappearance from the first opens the film, and it's a great move to remind the audience what happened in the original. To catch up so that they can begin the next part of what seems like the never ending journey. He also his a great entrance to the film itself after his intro. There's a great cast effort here. Andy Serkis, who maybe had 60 seconds of time in The Fellowship delivers a knockout performance here. Viggo Mortensen also shines here. The rest of the cast is also very good. You become emotionally attached to the great love story of Aragon and Arwen. There part of the film is one of the many highlights. The Two Towers contains intense and exciting editing. It's masterful and would've been perfect if some of the final battle could've been cut. We didn't really need a half hour battle scene, in my opinion. The only flaw, I'd say, is that scene. It's way too long, which makes the already lengthly film longer. Only flaw in a near perfect sequel. It ends on a fantastic and suspenseful note from first a monologue from Sam, then a shorter monologue from Gollum. Darker and scarier than the first, but all so visionary, it won't disappoint fans. Jackson's directing is continued with great class for the most part. Essentially, there are three story lines in this chapter because all the Fellowship has divided and split up, but the transitions are smooth and well-done, creating a marvelous adventure; 10",Null,0,1,5 September 2010
22 Jump Street," Redundant slapstick comedy, unearned laughs, and vacuously written dialogue.
","As published by the Morrisons Cove Herald on June 19, 2014.BY RYAN C. SHOWERS'21 Jump Street,' the satirical reboot of the '80s detective show by the same name, hit theaters in 2012 and gathered a vast profit of $138 million at the Domestic Box Office. Columbia Film Studios have since called upon the original film's key ingredients, Channing Tatum's swooning looks and Jonah Hill's inherently comedic presence, to replicate the success with a sequel. Unfortunately, the newly released film does little beyond the borders of plain stupidity. '22' Jump Street' is the product of redundant slapstick comedy, unearned laughs, and vacuously written dialogue.Morton Schmidt (Hill) and Greg Jenko (Tatum) return as undercover cops, but instead of chasing culprits around the halls of high school, the partners are transferred to college. Their assignment is to locate the student supplying the drug 'WHYPHY' to other enrolled scholars. WHYPHY (pronounced like Wifi) is responsible for the death of a student, so Schmidt and Jenko rise to the task of unmasking the drug-selling miscreant. But Jenko becomes the star football player on campus and Schmidt begins a relationship with an attractive art student, so their investigation wilts due to lacking focus. Will their friendship and detective mission surmount Jenko and Schmidt's halted bromance?As part of their introduction to college, Jenko and Schmidt attend a stand-up, impromptu poetry reading. During one student's performance, the main characters stare, unimpressed with the entertainment before them. I could not help but identify with the characters, for this is how I felt while watching '22 Jump Street.' The fans that this sequel was made for will roar laughing, but film analysts may levitate out of their seats while watching this from feelings of superiority.For a movie that documents the experience of going to college so extensively, '22 Jump Street' is not smart enough of a movie to attend any higher education. People investing ten dollars to be entertained will just laugh along with all vapid race humor, homosexual jokes, and feminist mockery, but for those using their brains during the 112 minutes of '22 Jump Street' will find the overabundance of offensive dialogue to be insipid.'22 Jump Street' has no reservations in embracing its self-aware tone and meta jokes. The film is informed of its status in the motion picture hierarchy and quite literally discusses the deigning risks and filmmaking process of constructing a sequel to a comedy reboot. Conversations the studio heads probably had with the creative team behind '22' Jump Street' exist in the screenplay and are acted out on screen – for example: tightening the budget, reinstating the repetitious plot, etc.For all the low-bar tricks they try to pull, the writers generously illustrate the characters in a semi-realistic way. Since 'Moneyball' and 'The Wolf of Wall Street,' Jonah Hill can now label himself as a 'Two-Time Academy Award Nominee' and his performance reflects that newfound confidence. Hill is one of the finest, most mature assets of '22 Jump Street.' On the contrary, Tatum, who has received rave reviews out of the Cannes Film Festival for his serious turn in the unreleased 'Foxcatcher,' humiliates himself here. He has a blast in his role, but unfortunately does not convince in moments of gushing farce.'22 Jump Street' makes indelible, evident mistakes, yet most will find it to be imbecilic fun and slimy entertainment. A two-minute sequence of brilliance occurs directly before the credits roll, a scene that cleverly answers the question of possible future sequels. The nifty, comical conclusion earns a few slivers of true respect for the overall product.Rating: 4/10* 1/2 / ****",Null,3,8,20 June 2014
Dog Day Afternoon," Chiseling and Involving
","Not much is explained about the bank robbery in Dog Day Afternoon at the picture's start. All the information we're given are the thieve's names and the dialogue exchanges they release to their captives. What's interesting is how connected we feel to the characters being held captive in the bank, the police trying to extinguish the situation, and the publicity outside. It's like we're one of the townspeople watching in the background or one of the tellers in the bank. We're put directly in the middle of the catastrophe and learn Sonny's motivations at the same time as the characters themselves them. Uniquely, we almost believe we are apart of this grand heist. We feel Sonny's humanity, despite the situation at hand. Dog Day Afternoon tells us what we're about to see is an accurate depiction of these events that took place in New York City before the action of the movie begins. Once that idea was placed in my head, the more I felt like I was watching an event, not a movie. Director Sidney Lumet blurs the lines of cinema and journalistic news reporting. The film doesn't play as one or the other, instead it's a more involving experience. The screenplay brilliantly recounts the events and shapes together a suffocating and chiseling incident. Dog Day Afternoon accounts the amateur plans and actions of the characters realistically. It's a special film that taps on different parts of our mind and interest. Al Pacino is the movie. He's in nearly every scene and commands the screen with his flawed, compassionate, warped character. Pacino attacks the character from the right approach. Sonny thinks he has everything under control, but he doesn't know or think he looks ridiculous or inexperienced. As the movie grows, the more we learn of Sonny and we see Pacino's portrayal growing and growing. The film finally arrives Sonny's character climax in a lengthy scene where Sonny speaks on the telephone. In that scene, Pacino reaches new levels of intensity that he only scraped the surface of in the Godfather trilogy. The film contains little musical score, which works to its advantage. A musical score exists to aid the actors in expressing what the characters are feeling. In Dog Day Afternoon, we're watching a 'common man' robbing a bank, it's a representation of a real-life event. Thanks to the cutting directing, involved writing, and absorbing acting, there's no need to force the audiences hand to understand the story. The film even boldly tackles issues of homosexuality with poise. Holding your attention, Dog Day Afternoon recounts the event probably better than it was played out in real-life.

Amadeus," Unconventional telling of a famous figure rooted in jealously.
","That laugh. Amadeus is represented through the icon of that laugh. Whether he was nervous, embarrassed, or just out of his blatant immaturity, the audience gets the pleasure of that laugh from Mozart frequently during this film. Amadeus is a fictionalized telling of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but more importantly, it tells a darker side of the human condition where jealousy is amplified, the performances are rich, and the production values make for one great period piece. Amadeus has an unconventional storytelling method of an important figure in the world. Instead of following Mozart as the hero and Salieri as the villain of the story, Salieri is the protagonist. We learn Mozart's story through someone else's eyes, which makes sense if you think about it. Seeing a legend's story told through the eyes of someone else gives us a chance to see that person for how they acted, not how they internally felt. I really love the approach and am inspired by the choice.We all have felt jealous, we've all had the jarring stab in the gut when we see someone do something better than us. It's never been better expressed than here in Amadeus. It's the topic most emphasized in the picture and it's always successfully explored. We can instantly identify with Salieri; though he's driven by rage and envy, we never look to him as the bad guy. Instead we look at him as a dark part of ourselves. Jealously as intense as the situation in Amadeus could make us question everything about ourselves: our talent, our interests, our beliefs in God. The immoral resentment conveyed on screen is something remarkable, proving that jealousy has no limits to what it can do to a man.Being as organized as an uptight, old lady's desk drawer, Amadeus never feels as long as its extensive running time suggests. It moves from scene to scene, keeping the story and characters alive and interesting enough for us to care. The set of the theatre house is dauntingly beautiful and costume design fits the film like the last piece to a jigsaw puzzle making the film a stunning thing to view. Amadeus about one of the most celebrated musicians in history is obviously going to thrive in the music department, and it does, each song magnified to be an epic musical spectacle. It's the grand exploration Mozart's music labors deserve.A Tale of Two Madmen. The first man too childish for his own good. The second driven mad by jealousy. The characterization of Mozart is fantastic by Tom Hulce. Hucle embodies the musician's tantalizing spirit and has wild eccentric power behind the portrayal. The only time Saleri ever fully gets the praise over Mozart is with the actor's portrayals of the two figures. F. Murray Abraham is the true star in Amadeus, pushing the sad man through his flesh, making him pop. The two performances stay true to the souls of their characters: Saleri's jealousy grows him into an even older man than his age, while Mozart's youth feels everlasting as is his musical composition.Amadeus is artistic work in every sense of the word. It shows the gifted artist collecting the brilliance that seeps through his skull, the strain behind that gift. But it shows the even more consuming tendencies artists who aren't struggle to find live up to what they make their lives about. Amadeus is a masterful film that captures the hideous emotion of jealousy and insanity in a way that still isn't forgotten today.Rating: 10/10Grade: A",Null,0,1,22 July 2013
Big Hero 6," A Jolting Experience of Modern Fun
","The way I viewed 'Big Hero 6' is that it's the answer to all of the little boys who may have enjoyed 'Frozen' but didn't couple themselves to it as passionately as maybe the females in their age group. What 'Frozen' was to young girls is what 'Big Hero 6' is to young boys, except it is not as deftly written as the former was. The writing is clever even if the dialogue feels hammy and as artificial as they could have made it. The screenplay solidly emphasizes the vitality of intellect in the life of a teenager, as well as a theme of technology's growing power and capabilities. 'Big Hero 6' most aptly expresses to younger males a sensitivity than can exist within the gender and does it in a way that is not extreme but a relatively understandable level.The bright visuals and speeding energy awaken the picture. It's a jolting experience of modern fun. Kids will have a blast and laugh until their stomaches hurt. Baymax is the selling point of 'Big Hero 6' and he doesn't disappoint as a children's story character: he's like the epitome of a light-hearted, honest, articulate, tubby, inflatable hug. It has compassion and action, an irresistible pair of traits in a children's movie.* * * / * * * *Grade: B+",Null,1,19,13 November 2014
Evil Dead," The Cast & Crew Embarrass Themselves and Sam Rami
","We all can remember the reaction we had to Sam Rami's Evil Dead trilogy back in the late '80s. It involved a collected range from great delight due to the comedic undertone set by Rami, the 'Ewwwww' sounds we made in our head as blood splattered all over the camera lens, and the moments that scared us enough to take a few bathroom breaks. The first two films were the two most memorable horror films of the 1980s and should be celebrated. Though Army of Darkness didn't hold the stature of the original two, it supplied the viewer a different path of the story and brought the story to a close suitably. Optimistically, I'll start with the qualities I found credible. From the prologue of, the Evil Dead remake has an eerie look to it that stirs up the suspense in your eyes. The film score in a horror film is so vital, and that's one thing this movie does get right, I really loved the score. The house in which the film is shot in, is styled in a morose manner that makes for a good setting for a ghost story such as this. The make-up design for Evil Dead is overwhelming, the jury is still out whether that means it works for the film or against it. I began to wonder if they just tacked on unnecessary gore-cenrtic tags to scenes to literally stop the story from ascending to anything at all and just please blood craving suckers.I think if any horror film were to be remade (I still don't understand why we're remaking highly successful, quality horror movies to begin with), The Evil Dead would be a great choice as long as it was tackled without an approach of comedy. The film takes that chance, it's nice to see the contrast in storytelling, but it isn't that successful. Sam Rami's film was cut off from reality, but they knew it and embraced it with their method of injecting comedy to the scares. With this approach, they have to at least pretend this could actually happen to people somewhere in the world, but I never got that feeling of reality once. It retained the tacky qualities of the original, but didn't inherit the quality. It isn't scary! A few times, it begins to build to something frightening, but it never surmounts that peak. Evil Dead's quick pan-in shots that cut to preposterous demon snaps don't get my fear levels rumbling. The demon shots themselves play like a early development versions of The Exorcist that just took an enthusiastic dose of acid. It's not even well made enough to constitute as a throwaway, entertainment fodder. With little sense of structure, recycled dialogue, characters who purposely go against the way rational human beings problem solve, Evil Dead retains no class and should have 'Tasteless' written over the DVD cover in fire- engine, red-blood splatter. One thing Evil Dead attempts to do is create some humanity with a topic about the overconsumption of drug and family issues. Too bad, it collapses in the attempts. At least it tries. Forcing myself to sit through the duration of the last twenty minutes, I stared with a foul look poisoning the screen thinking about the future of this genre. Creativity needs be revived and filmmakers need to grow the story realistically and stop trying to stylize every singly shot of movie. The result of that over-pizazz in horror films is all horror films feel the same nowadays. There's nothing to define The Evil Dead from the movie of the week except its ancestors reputation. We need to take the characters seriously to open up to a movie, we have to take the characters seriously to take the story seriously; and we have to take the story seriously to take the movie seriously. Poor special effects are a inconsistent aspect of Evil Dead, but the dreadful acting can be found any minute of the movie. The film has the impudence to try to end with symbolism; eject the film from your DVD player before you even have the misfortune of seeing that. Evil Dead should have been retitled 'How Many Times Can a Body Be Mutilated Without Croaking', that way Sam Rami's films wouldn't have had to undergo such awful representation to the new era of horror junkies.

Prisoners," Exhilarating Thriller Made For the Right Reasons
","Adult films of noteworthy mention rarely exist anymore, unless they are after Oscar Gold. It's been slim pickings for adult audiences who may not be in the mood to attempt an awards contender, but want to be treated like they have some brain activity. Thrillers are a great use of adult films, actors and audience. Adults want to feel the 'edge' of suspense stories, like teenagers do with horror films; but while not wasting their time with a low quality film. Prisoners brings back that genre that has felt extinct since 2005, a colossal year for thrillers. The acting is fantastic. Prisoners hired actors who know how to act and wanted to make the picture for the sake of trying their best. Hugh Jackman punches us with his vehemence, a performance that shakes you, even if his accent may not be etched out with perfection. Jake Gyllenhaal has a more unnoticed character that slowly builds to moments allowing Gyllehaal to execute strength and power.Viola Davis brings the house down with only one meaty scene. Terrance Howard reiterates he's a talent that can convey massive emotion by saying very little. Melissa Leo turns in her best post-Oscar portrayal, but still doesn't 'wow' us like she used to. Sadly, Maria Bello didn't cut it for me. Her crying scenes seem phony and I don't empathize with her character. The character is written to be a mother barely grasping onto hope in her life; it feels like Bello didn't put the effort in to make that character reach her full potential. After seeing as many films as I have, especially films intended to spook you, sooner or later you learn all the tricks and your threshold adapts to the environment you've grown a part of. Prisoners is the one film in a good while to actually scare me. Some images are terrifying and built with perfect sinister tone, while other scenes match those with jolting chases or disturbing moments of torture. The themes aren't anything groundbreaking, we've felt the messages of Prisoners in dozens of other films in the past. There's parallelism drawn with the conclusion, grief and religion are inevitable in a film of this topic, but those dramatics are not what interested me. The plain message that comes with the drastic twist just pleads to parents and babysitters to never underestimate anyone. Predators are lurking to swoop anything they can get their hands on at the right time. Child kidnapping is still a sensitive topic to be used in films right now and I found the plot pushing the envelope to be exhilarating.I believe in years to come Prisoners will gain a reputation similar to Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino's '90s hit, Heat: universally praised, cult-bound, and unnoticed with accolades. Both genre films give the audience credit to maintain a well-paced narrative. Prisoners doesn't feed us unnecessary information, it often cuts a scene off when the built action reaches the goal of the scene without letting us see the predictable result. Prisoners puts its genre on the path for the future.Grade: A-Rating: 8/10",Null,2,5,25 September 2013
Annie Hall," Hilarious and Original
","Watching a film like Annie Hall is a breath of fresh air. An breath so fresh, it changes your outlook on life. Annie Hall is an unparalleled romantic comedy and sets a precedent for films to come for ages. With its scattered narrative structure and outrÃ© characters, Annie Hall settles right at the top of the list of romantic comedies that are actually worth it to the audience. Woody Allen infuses his peculiar, masterful script with different strategies and innovative methods of storytelling.Allen's biggest ally in Annie Hall is himself. Writer, director, and protagonist. Allen invents his own style to create irony and make the adult audience laugh. He is wonderful at thinking up the most strange, unusual things that are hilarious such as eating soup in a house under a subway and the many Jewish jokes. Allen knows what he's doing, all aspects of his work is dynamic. The main character is a difficult person, who knew that difficult people in life could bring send such positive vibes to the world?Humor. Humor. Humor. Annie Hall forges strength from the humor. The film opens with a mildly devastating thought about life, however, but it fits with the tone film wonderfully. Allen really captures the essence of life and love with every line that's written. The film stands on its own two feat so well because it's a mature, realistic, adult film at heart. Diane Keaton is as cute as a smiley face on a cupcake the title character and creates a dignified female character. Allen is genus, but you can't help wonder who was the real life Annie Hall that inspired this film.Woody Allen proliferated the genre and film audiences expectations of romantic comedies. The beauty with Annie Hall is with all the crazy spins Allen puts on the genre into his short, clean film is that it never feels as weird as it actually is. It's a movie that still resembles a movie, and not an attempt to make something so far out there it's unreachable to the average moviegoer. It will satisfy the next Joe wanting to be entertained for ninety minutes, but will thrill film lovers dying for a new life to the genre.Rating: 9.5/10Grade: A",Null,1,2,5 July 2013
Selma," Beams with Sweeping Artistry
","A narrative film with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as the protagonist has never been made. Think about that for a minute. One of the most revered American heroes in history and the face of the fight for equality has never been the focus of a movie before, despite the raging desire for biopics in Hollywood. (It is mindboggling to think about the impact Dr. King had, and the wealth of knowledge even young children know about him without a driving influence from the movies.) But that has changed now: 'Selma' is the first film to position the narrative from Dr. King's point of view.Set in 1964, the film begins with Annie Lee Cooper (portrayed by Oprah Winfrey) trying to register to vote in Selma, AL. Even with the necessary paperwork and knowledge, the registrar harasses Annie with grueling questions about government and the state, to all of which she replies accurately except for the final question that is nearly impossible to answer. Her application is thus denied. This scene paves the framework for the film, establishing the setting of the crux of the film and the bitter racial tensions surrounding the time period.Martin Luther King, Jr. (played by David Oyelowo) frequently meets with President Lyndon B. Johnson, pleading with him to support the Voting Rights Act and to prevent obstruction and harassment of black citizens when they attempt to register to vote. President Johnson shrugs this off as a more trivial problem than other issues he must deal with. Dr. King devises a nonviolent protest, a march through Selma to the voting registration office. After this ends in an altercation and the nonviolent protesters are arrested, but another march from Selma to Montgomery is planned under Dr. King's resolute agenda for justice.'Selma' is an exhilarating movie, one that feels especially relevant in the social climate of today where our society faces racial injustices like that of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The movie does not preach nor intend to spark white guilt, but instead presents significant facts of the past in an absorbing way. It feels less like a history lesson and more like a bedtime story our parents tell us before we fall asleep.The Academy Award nominations were announced in January and though 'Selma' was among the eight films nominated for Best Picture, it only received one other nomination for Best Original Song. Many critics and Oscar pundits voiced their disappointment in the egregious snubs Selma endured for Ava DuVernay in Best Director and Oyelowo in Best Actor. When watching 'Selma,' it feels like Oyelowo was sent from God to portray Dr. King. Not only does he bear a resemblance to Dr. King and finds the distinctive outward traits of the man, he also inhabits the man beneath his surface.Seldom are there movies where the directing upstages the story and actors, but 'Selma' is one of those cases. DuVernay's sensational approach beams with a sweeping artistry. If she had been welcomed by the Academy, DuVernay would have been the first African American director ever nominated. Her work in 'Selma' would have been worthy of holding such a landmark title in Oscar history.'Selma' is the defining film that deserves to be tied to Martin Luther King Jr.'s revered legacy. It is something that should be seen by everyone across the country as a reminder of how far we have come as a society in acknowledging equal rights for everyone, and as even a bigger reminder of how far we still have a long way to go before the fight that Dr. King began is truly over.Grade: A* * * * / * * * *",Null,1,2,18 February 2015
The Artist," Aging Actors, Change, and Talkies make for a great time!
","Change. It's something that happens, sometimes reluctantly to people who have lived an event so long it becomes faded, out of date, and is being passed up by the wanting of 'the new'. Change is the central topic of The Artist. There was a time Hollywood was innocent, filled with lightness and fluff. The paparazzi weren't trying to tear actors images to pieces for no good reason. Movies were made for the sake of having a good time, not worrying about being the most financially successful or who will win the most Academy Awards. The Artist shows us that time, and though it's a delightful film, it does cross into some dark territory.The Artist may look like is a bagatelle with no worries in the world, everyone is happy all the time. It does charm the smile right onto your face, but what surprised me is The Artist's gloomy periods of human struggle. The Artist also covers the subject of Hollywood Actors being discarded when their time is up. Studio executives treat actors like throwaway cards in their poker games. It's tragic when a person builds their entire life with one light guiding their every decision, then, without warning being dismissed forever. The smart choice The Artist makes is having a man experience this situation because it's cliché to think women only get this discrimination. It's the harsh fact of the entertainment business.Yes, it does cover some deep thoughts about Hollywood, but the quality that distinguishes The Artist is the style in which the tells us the story to us. Back in the days when silent pictures were all the film world had, 'talkies' were the films everyone was fascinated by. The Artist proves the irony of today's society being drawn to the silent picture approach. Silent characters allows the film score to become the life of the movie. The way we react depends on the score and what it tells us. The score works toward the making the images accessible to the audience, and the visuals are just as pleasing as the musical composition. The imagination and creativity used to plan out and project the images of this time are glowing left to right, in the stunning black and white photography.The Artist's second life necessity to breathing is laughing. I felt like I was laying on a cloud and whenever they laugh, it's like you're being tickled with a me with a feather. It's a pleasure to sit through The Artist, you'll having a great time. The nostalgia for the days of silent movies is amplified even more through Jean Dujardin rocking the look of the classical actors. You have such fun watching Dujardin in the role, that you may not notice the acting the man has behind his character. He creates an uncompromising charm for the protagonist, as well as dwelling on the character's misfortunes in later scenes. Berenice Bejo is lovely in her role, as well, but doesn't quite have the well-rounded character Dujardin was given.Make The Artist you're #ThrowbackThursday, because it glorifies and eventually tears down a significant time in the history of entertainment. Michel Hazanvicius directs his picture with all the gusto to make us enjoy the time we're spending with the characters. He doesn't smother the picture, instead just lets the picture live. The ending is perfectly executed, progressing the moving times in a cute and classy manner. As soon as I parted ways with The Artist, the more I reflected on the time I spent watching it, the more I found a deeper appreciation for it. Rating: 8.5/10Grade: A",Null,3,5,14 August 2013

Marilyn Monroe is deliciously sweet in the centerpiece of the film of beauty and sexuality. This is widely considered to be her career best, its a shame she missed an Oscar nomination for it. Tony Curtis does a fine job as well. My favorite scene is the legendary 'I Wanna Be Loved By You' song lives up to the hype, it's a wonderful scene. My problem with Some Like It Hot is the lack of emotional investment I felt for the story or the characters.

Pulp Fiction," Pure Artistry.
","Imagine for a second, an eccentric filmmaker pitching an idea for a movie with three different story lines that all merit excitement and violence, except there's one catch...take all the 'action shots' out of the picture and keep the rest of the unnecessary fodder behind and that's the movie. The result of that unusual requested visions happened to be a unique, interesting, and original movie. Written and directed by Quentin Tarantino, Pulp Fiction defines itself as a distinctive film that will amuse, shock, and hold the audience in suspense. Tarantino crafted his work in the mid- 90s, a time when originality was lacking in film industry, everything had a formula that had to followed to be considered a technically 'good' movie. Roger Ebert claimed, 'there are film classes, computer programs, and websites telling exactly how a movie should be made.' The result of that is losing the one thing that movies are supposed to about: artistic expression. So what did Tarantino do? He showed the industry that every artist has their own voice. There shouldn't be collated, specific formula, because then the audience has the industry solved and rings out all magic is left to be discovered. In Pulp Fiction took three overplayed story lines and made us watch the 'awkward' scenes. What we wouldn't see in other movies, the time in between the action. The meaningless conversations you and I have every day with our friends and family. That is another thing missing from movies back then, humanity! On top of the risky, futile dialogue driven scenes, Tarantino mixed up the chronological order of the picture. And on the cherry on top of Tarantino's sundae is the misfit, creepy characters he asks us to identify with. Yet, through all of that the movie manages to soar and define itself as reputable piece of art. And that's the simplest and best way to sum up Pulp Fiction is art. Not only through Tarantino's inventive screenplay, but through his delicately placed direction. Each shot is filled with something unique that'd driven by the motivation of the characters or the overall arc of the story. It's a masterfully directed piece. The direction is even more artistic than the screenplay. With the screenplay, as much work as Tarantino put into penning the words, the actors are in control of the success of those words being told. In the direction, Tarantino is in control and he never relinquishes that control making the audience really feel plunged into the idiotic situations the characters end up in. There are moments where Tarantino injects huge laughs, chiseling thrills, and always retaining the humanity of the story. The three stories are all different, they are their own piece, that all work toward the same goal of each other, however each section has it's own tone and exclusive arc, they all end with the same two things: a saving of someone's life and a secret. I believe Tarantino intended for that to be a metaphor for a director/writer in their creative world making their movies. To be successful they have to work to save the industry they are releasing their films to and they have to keep their own voice to themselves and be unique, so no one else can steal their style. Beyond Tarantino's creative efforts much lies behind the walls of Pulp Fiction. Tarantino adds to the film's statement of Hollywood by finding a way to inject movie references of some of the highest regarded motion pictures, including The Godfather. The film editing bounces off the screen, staying true to the characters at hand and the film's plot in the moment. It's tight, brisk, and entertaining, while still saying something. With such a strong effort from its direction and screen writing aspects, it's clearly stated that it's not going to be an actors movie, though the four principle actors deliver some great work. The standout performance is Samuel L. Jackson, his best works lies with the final scene of the movie. It's a heated scene and Jackson only adds to the intensity. Bruce Willis highlights his career with his role, while John Travola and Uma Thurma deliver fine acting jobs and line deliveries as well.The definition of Pulp is written on the screen for us before we meet any of the characters at the start of the picture, defined as 'a soft, moist, shapeless mass of matter' and 'a magazine or book containing lurid subject matter and being characteristically printed on rough, unfinished paper.' That's exactly what this refreshing film is: messy, unorganized, and an unformed bulk of art. Rating: 10/10Grade: A+",Null,0,1,23 June 2013

","No matter how skilled you are with what's the latest Oscar Buzz or equipped with the knowledge of anticipating which film this week will sustain the longevity of film history such as No Country for Old Men, The Dark Knight, or The Artist, sometimes you have to take films for what they are and judge them on what they try to be. Such is the case with Zombieland. In a film that frolics its way through its well-paced 88 minute running time, Zombieland isn't lacking the quality as the title suggests. The film covers its ground with of developing its characters, fulfilling story arcs, and adding gore on the gore. Zombieland's use of narration is maybe the key to the film that makes it positively stand out from all the horror-comedies today. Though the film tries to market the adult audience through the respected Woody Harrelson and Oscar nominee, Abigail Breslin, the newcomers (at the time of release), Jesse Eisenberg and Emma Stone carry the picture well for the cards they were dealt. Were they inexperienced? Sure. But every great star must begin their walk on some street, no matter how shady it may appear. The focus on selling the film to teenage nerds through identification could use some lessons in subtly, forcing the 'typical sissy-geek who will eventually turn hero' character type down the throats of its audience. Zombieland is certainly gunning for a target audience, but the film would've been fine without all the stereotypes, even if every audience member doesn't come with the experimental histories of the protagonist. Though this is a movie about an apocalyptic zombie world, Zombieland at least sets sails in the right direction, even if what it preaches (loneliness and substituting friends for family) has been told countless other times in film and television before. Zombieland works as a satire, and at the very least, a well-made, enjoyable popcorn flare. Rating: 6/10 Grade: B",Null,0,0,4 September 2013
Psycho," Hitchcock Exceeds Anything He's Ever Done
","Psycho is recognized for its brilliant direction, ear-grinding score, distinctive performances, haunting cinematography, and tightly equipped editing, but the forgotten asset is the screenplay. None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness.Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career.Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower.The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters.The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal.Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself 'Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife', each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene.Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film.Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience.Grade: A+Rating: 10.5/10",Null,0,1,23 September 2013
12 Years a Slave," A Rewatch can Change a lot
","My quirks with this one may had been conceived from the inescapable praise 12 Years a Slave underwent from critics and audiences. While I liked it the first time I saw it, I had my problems with it, the two biggest ones being the editing and McQueen's direction. The editing still has its issues that should have been worked out, but I found McQueen's direction to be one of the most valuable assets to the film this time through. 12 Years a Slave has this three-dimensional feel to it and that's thanks to Steve McQueen. The brutality the film is now famous for is thanks to McQueen, too, he held nothing back. There is a lack of sentiment still present, but it doesn't feel like McQueen's fault solely, I can't pinpoint which component made the film lack it.People who watch as many movies as Oscar Buzzers can become immune to film violence, but there were three of four moments where the film crosses my line of comfort. Sadly, my opinion has lessened even more of my already mixed reaction of Lupita Nyong'O. Half the problem is her character is begging for our sympathy, but the other half is Nyong'O lack of depth and creativity. Her 'acting' felt less like acting and more like Steve McQueen releasing violence against women and blacks in one package, cueing our tears to swell. Fassbender remains my choice for Best Supporting Actor this year for his commitment performance. Ejiofor's acting ability increased on this rewatch. He uses a self-aware, theatrical manner of reciting his lines that felt fake to me before and slightly did at first this time, but the emotional exterior does more to compensate and releases a chemical that makes the 'theatrical' element work for him. 12 Years a Slave draws a menacing template of hell on Earthan interesting metaphor, considering Brad Pitt looks like Jesus with his long hair and is the character that puts the rewarding finale into motion.Updated Rating: 7.9",Null,4,12,9 November 2013
The Wolf of Wall Street," Obnoxious, Distasteful, and Borderline Offensive
","When The Wolf of Wall Street first begins its nearly three hour running-time, you aren't exactly sure when the opening studio titles end and the film begins because of Scorsese's stylized letterboxing academy ratios with certain scenes, emphasizing a television type framing as opposed to the rest of the film's widescreen cinematography. The questioning doesn't stop there; after the entire year of anticipation, the story of Jordan Belfort unfolds for the first hour, I continued to wonder when the real The Wolf of Wall Street was going to start.I follow numerous accounts on Instagram, on Christmas morning I came across a screenshot someone took on their iPhone of an elderly female critic reviewing The Wolf of Wall Street. With rotten icon from Rotten Tomatoes and the preview of her review stating, 'Too much sex and drug use,' I rolled my eyes in agreement with the Instagram account of the unfair criticism. Then I saw The Wolf of Wall Street and realized it was not just a senior citizen compliant, I think Scorsese crossed the line of fun and entered an area of repugnance.I may be the only member of my age group (18-24) who complains about the overuse of sex, greed, and drugs, call me an old man, but after a three hours enough is enough. If The Wolf of Wall Street had some sense of a moral compass that drove the narrative, I may not criticize this aspect so harshly, but neither Scorsese nor the screenplay has anything to offer the audience to latch onto in selfish, unlikable, pathetic characters.Scorsese had to tell the story of Jordan Belfort and I'm sure his life was as unruly as the film paints it to be, but he abandons any sense of class. This is not the Scorsese we all have been enamored with the past. The Wolf of Wall Street is the type of film to be enjoyed by the same audience as The Hangover, not award voting Academy members or critical film analysts. I kept having the feeling I had seen this exact same film in May with flashier costumes, called The Great Gatsby. Wolf is not that far off from it, a few steps above Gatsby in terms of quality filmmaking, but the empty feeling it gives off to the audience is no different.Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese's fifth collaboration has been brewing in the minds of everyone who enjoyed their previous films and hope that one day they can finally 'click' the way Scorsese did with Robert DeNiro back at the apex of their careers. The best thing The Wolf of Wall Street has on its side is Leonardo DiCaprio's eminent charm; he melts his audience and hits some of the greatest highs of his acting career. Certainly deserves to be included in any of the Best Actor races this award season.The Wolf of Wall Street's problems do not stem from the technicalities of filmmaking. Though the storytelling half of Scorsese's job that could have been executed much better, at least he forms the shell of a quality movie. His films typically have a masterwork of film editing; the editing for Wolf is no exception. It is like DiCaprio is snapping his fingers the whole for the three hours. The look of the film is another strength. The juicy cinematography looks as if it was painted with the infinite money made my Jordan Belfort.Some of Scorsese's past film successes find themselves drilled into The Wolf of Wall Street. The first person point of view from Goodfellas and Casino is put to good use, it even grows in this film. DiCaprio not only narrates the majority of the film, but also pulls a Woody Allen and looks directly at the audience and speaks to us like we are having a private conversation with Jordan Belfort. His obsession with wealth and drugs damaging his life and family echoes from Raging Bull, but this works against Wolf. In Raging Bull we saw Jake LaMotta beat his wife, but we also felt his guilt. There's a scene in Act Three that feels like a direct homage to Raging Bull, but Wolf lacks the humanity of that film. Scorsese wanted to isolate us from the world in Wolf like he did in Taxi Driver, where we understood the violence Travis yearned for, but here Wolf fails to tug at the same cords with greed as Taxi Driver did with loneliness.At the end of the day does the greedfest of The Wolf of Wall Street matter? No. If it were not so hollow, it could have been a fun movie, but I didn't even buy into the 'enjoyment.' People around me were laughing at the slapstick comedy, but I did not find most of it funny, not even DiCaprio's raved physical comedy scene in the last section of the film. I shrugged my shoulders after the first thirty seconds and then the scheme continued for five more minutes. Not a bad film, a bad narrative, and a poorly communicated film. If I retitled the film, it would read: The Disappointment of Wall Street.Grade: B-Rating: 6",Null,13,26,31 December 2013
Scream 2," Part 2 Continues to 'WOW'
","The Scream Trilogy is the film series that redefined fear. They revived the horror genre. The one Alfred Hitchcock sunned everyone with Psycho. The one John Carpenter's Halloween brought serial killers afloat to. Even our own Wes Craven did by scaring us in the only place we found comfort in with A Nightmare on Elm Street. Now, with the Scream trilogy, the horror genre was brought back to life continuing the face of iconic fear. Wes Craven, as mentioned before, is the master of suspense. When Kevin Williamson's script was out on the prow, Craven was really the only proper choice to direct. His method of scaring the audience never fails. He has so much control over the three stories without the feeling of 'over-directing'. For many years, Freddy Kruger was hailed as Craven's masterpiece, this trilogy is now and will be his crowning achievement. Kevin Williamson wrote the original and the sequel, then Ehren Kruger came along to write the third when Williamson declined. However, Williamson basically outlined the story for Kruger, leaving the dialogue and details to Kruger. All three scripts are absolutely incredible and tantalizing original. The story grows as the series continues and it becomes more intricate. Now, it'd be tough to choose between the three, which is my favorite. But, I think as the story becomes more complicated, I was more intrigued, which may be the only factor to say the films get better as we go along. That aside, the three are so close together with quality, entertainment, suspense, and as films overall. It's difficult for a film trilogy to achieve that. Most times, sequels get worse, but here? No such thing.The thing that really separates Scream from the average film series besides the screenplay, the direction, the suspense level, the tech stuff, and the visuals is the acting. This is what I call true acting ensemble. The two dazzlingly standouts are Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox. What performances. Now, it's no surprise that Sidney, Gale, and Dewey are in all three films. So Campbell and Cox have to sustain their performances over three films. It's extraordinary. David Arquette, I'll check him off first. He is funny and dorky in the first two films. He really adds to the table in Scream 3. He finally 'grows up' and isn't as insecure, which is a lovely thing to see.You see the actors grow and fall as their characters. Campbell really finds Sidney Prescott, the true essence of the character. Campbell does something tricky here. She shows us a girl who is in a horrible place in her life, who is strong and can make it in the world, but is also vulnerable and weak. It's tricky, but she pulls it off with grace. Sidney is this tormented young woman, and Campbell never shies away from that; how she can act with her eyes can simply not be put into words, it's that great. Courteney Cox is fierce as Gale Weathers. She leaves her comfy zone (the control freak Monica Geller on Friends). Cox steps up the dramatic work here, especially in Scream 2. The character Gale Weathers grows from being a 'wannabe' b*tch, to being a successful and rub it in your face more of a b*tch. Then in Scream 3, she changes. After her true feelings for Dewey were revealed in Scream 2, Gale was tamed and not so much of the witch she once was. I've mentioned her dramatic work in Scream 2 a few times. It is simply the best of her career. In Scream 1, she was hinting that she had feelings for Dewey, but also hinting she was using him for information. In Scream 2, she finally lets lose and says 'I don't care,' and gives in. Right as she confesses herself, the situation diminishes. Cox is so good in the scene where she is the sound room and sees Dewey being stabbed through the mirrors (to what she thought was his death). It's heartbreaking. In Scream 2, Jada Pinkette is hilarious, without a funny character. Her section of the film is awesome and a great follow-up to Barrymore's from the original film. Sarah Michelle Gellar also has a small role here and makes the most of her seven-minute screen time. Laurie McCalf is also very good here. Jamie Kennedy, who survived the first film reprises his role here and it's always a fun time when he's on the screen.The Screams are also grand on the technical scale, too. The ghostface costume has become the most frightening, iconic horror film costume. It screams fear. The brilliance of it is, this mask wasn't made specifically for the film. I was a regular Halloween costume sold in stores everywhere. That's what makes it scarier. The great master, Wes Craven once said, 'Something isn't scary unless people can identify with it and could possibly be in the same positions as the characters on the screen. The films also include a killer score and frightening sets (especially John Milton's house, where the climax of Scream 3 takes place).Bob Weinstein, the producers of the Scream trilogy, now demanded a fourth installment. Why? To make a few bucks? Scream fits perfectly as a trilogy, without any loose ends and had a wonderful ending filled with metaphors and a great chase scene. Williamson is back writing. Having him back on board with Craven directing and three survivors back gives me some comfort that it won't fail completely, but I'm scared for it's survival. Let's just hope for the best. Overall, without a doubt, the best trilogy ever made. My personal favorite films; they're fun, very scary, with excellent performances, writing and directing. What more could you want?

Inception," If it doesn't win Best Picture at the Academy Awards, it would've been robbed...
","...And I'm not one of those Nolan/Dark Knight-fan-boys. This really deserves every praise it's getting. One of the most anticipated films of the year, Inception, is nothing short of spectacular. When reviews were pouring in, critics were honoring it as one of the best films of the year. My anticipation level was through the roof, and while I had my doubts, it succeeded every expectation I had. I don't even know where to begin, everything about this film is worthy of Oscar consideration. The script written by Christopher Nolan is one of the most brilliant pieces of art ever written. It's so intelligent, thought-provoking, and completely original. I like to think that I can call myself 'a writer,' but after seeing Inception, no person compares to Christopher Nolan's writing here. Christopher Nolan also directs the film with such confidence. Many think he was snubbed in 2008 for a Best Director nomination, if he's snubbed again this year (which I highly doubt), the Academy will have some explaining to do. He takes this material that was masterfully written and turns it into his remarkable vision. This is a film where so much depended on the director, and he thankfully held up his end of the deal and more. This would be a terrifying adventure for someone who doesn't pay attention to a film always. When you view the film, pretend as if there was a quiz afterward, otherwise it's easy to get lost. Nolan moves at the right pace for this film, he just asks you to meet him half-way, which a director should ask of you. You are connected more to the film that way. The performances are also wonderful. It's one of the best, if not the best, ensembles of the year. I got the feeling every cast member came to the set with the material in their hands ready to attack it. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of the most talented actors working today and he fits Cobb to a tee. Pitching the right emotion at the right time every time. Marion Cotillard, who is always the stand-out in her films since she started starring in American films, follows the tradition here. Her character wasn't at all what I expected her to be. She's the villain figure and with that delivers a hauntingly luminous portrait of Mal (which translates to 'Evil' in Latin, thank you Peter Travers). She's heart-breaking, frightening, and even charming, all in the matter of about a 20 minute performance. Ellen Page is effective as the brainy and curious girl who tries to follow in Cobb's footsteps. LeVitt gets a laugh here and there as much as he does with the dramatic scenes. Murphy steers with subtly of the brutality of being taking advantage of shortly after the death of his father.Inception is much of a stimulation on the narrative side as it is on the technical side. The cinematography is gorgeous. The lingering sets will impress you. Heck, even the costumes match the characters well, some are even beautiful for being a contemporary piece, Mal's costumes in particular. The special effects may seem a cross with The Matrix and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, but Inception stands as it's own in originality.With that being said, Christopher Nolan does something here some directors never get close to in their entire career, delivers a near-perfect film. Inception is more than a summer blockbuster and science fiction/ action film the trailers may imply. It's a must see; a solid 10.",Null,3,7,17 July 2010
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," An Innovative Achievement
","From the richness of 'Babel' and '21 Grams', we know Alejandro González Iñárritu has a knack for directing but he transcends to even greater levels of excellence with his astonishing work in 'Birdman'. He moves the camera, frames the shots, and sets up the material superbly but further dazzles you with his diligence in making a theatrical film experience. Iñárritu's 'Birdman' is one of the few exhilarating cinematic experiences of 2014. It's the type of movie that not only dares some arduous and fresh challenges, but actually surmounts them gracefully.'Birdman' develops a technique first established with 'Gravity' last year in filming entire blocks of time within a scene in a single take. Emmanuel Lubezki helps Iñárritu capture 'Birdman' with as little cutting in the film editing as possible. It slides around the actors and objects for nearly two hours without any noticeable moments where Iñárritu categorically moves from one separate shot to another.For 120 minutes, we see 'Birdman' fly with this technique perfected by the directing and photography. The spirit of the theater is uncorked by this 'gimmick', but to call it a 'gimmick' is feels unjust--it's a move of artistic genius and technical mastery to enhance the storytelling. In addition to relentlessly gliding around the actors and through the sets, the cinematography is softly-lit and possesses a tender radiance, making 'Birdman' easy on the eyes.'Birdman' is one of a kind. In the most elegant ways, it pushes the boundaries of art film in mainstream cinema. The screenplays harnesses a meta theme to a dark ideology and comments on show business, specifically how the reputations of actors become linked to certain defining roles, the difficulty in achieving beyond that hump, and the criticism involved with show business in the media-obsessed world of today. With so much creativity on display in the technical and acting departments, the finely formulated dialogue should fade into the background but it doesn't.The cast of 'Birdman' slays the project and unifies their talents for a spectacular result.For Michael Keaton playing this role must be so personal to him, and that seeps through from his real life into the fictional life of his character. Keaton has his fair share of 'Look At Me!' moments, such as when his character violently demolishes his dressing room, but I find his acting to be more thought-provoking in fragile and sensitive than the noisy scenes, as when he intimately speaks with his ex-wife and daughter about the past. (Though one cannot help but stare silly at Keaton knocking every loud moment out of the park, like when he, slightly inebriated, confronts and disparages a New York Times theater critic at a bar.) This performance is capable of winning him Best Actor at the Oscars and a win would certainly be deserved.Edward Norton is the right-hand man to Keaton's splendid leading performance. Norton conducts himself with a buoyant, ceaseless energy and won't be overlooked by anyone in the audience. Naomi Watts continues her string of post-'Diana' supporting roles, and she makes her role in 'Birdman' terrific, tearing into the audience's emotions to larger extents than other actresses would be able to do in the role. Emma Stone is receiving raves for her work here, though I found her to be a step below Keaton, Watts, and Norton, there's something she brings to her work--a tranquil, quiet stillness most noticed in her final scene with Keaton--that justifies the praise. Amy Ryan and Zach Galifanakis round out the cast. Though they are of the lesser utilized additions to the ensemble, they squeeze everything out of their briefer scenes.'Birdman' is resourcefully made, commandingly acted, and ambitiously envisioned; it's an innovative achievement.* * * * / * * * *Grade: A",Null,3,8,16 November 2014

Scream 1's acting was the most surprising. Mainly because with the horror genre you tend not to think, 'Oh, I'm in for some great acting'. It's stereotypical. After you see the first scene with Drew Barrymore, you'll be blown away; I was. She is so powerful in her one scene. She kind of pulls a Janet Leigh in Psycho. She was the biggest movie star, at the time, of the Scream cast. No one expected her to be the opening kill. Her acting isn't short of Leigh's either. For that scene to work, you needed an actor who could really hold his or her own and make it convincing. Drew was that actor. Skeet Ulrich plays effectively the infamous, Billy Loomis. Ulrich is spine chilling and creepy here, but does it with so much charisma.The Screams are also grand on the technical scale, too.

Halloween," One of the Greatest Depictions of the Horror Genre
","The original film of the series, 'Halloween' (1978), is one of the greatest depiction of the horror genre in cinematic history. John Carpenter's artful and patient direction is what sets it apart from other cash-grabbing slashers of the 1970s and 1980s. It's about pace and visual style as much as it is beautiful simplistic storytelling. Jamie Lee Curtis is a revelation as Laurie Strode, who is a female protagonist explored with an enormous amount of depth. Curtis puts forth one of the most notable breakout performances from any actor graced with the responsibility of playing a protagonist their first time out of the gate. Her co-star, Donald Pleasance's haunting, ineradicable presence as Dr. Samuel Loomis is also irreplaceable. If I would have been an Oscar voter in 1978, I would have voted for Curtis and Pleasance in the leading actor and actress races over Jane Fonda and Jon Voight in 'Coming Home.' They're aided by perfectly crafted dialogue and a balance storylines. Some scenes are told through Laurie's eyes, others Dr. Loomis', and some Michael's; these three distinctive perspectives coalesce cogently into one streamline plot, which is astutely executed astutely through the screenplay and direction. Perhaps the greatest single aspect of 'Halloween' is the film score, assured to strike fear into the most stoic of us all.

Iron Man," Find the Man in the Iron
","Back in 2008 when Iron Man was the insane box-office smash, truthfully never bothered to see it in theaters. I had no interest in the film, no matter how positively the reviews read. It was released on DVD at the beginning of Autumn, I did rent it to see if I would fall under the spell of Iron Man...I didn't. I thought it was neat, but my heart wasn't in perpetuated with it. I was astonished that people compared it to the Christopher Nolan masterpiece,The Dark Knight, released that same year. When Iron Man 2 was released, the same situation occurred (almost like deja vu), where I rented it, didn't care for it (though I did take interest in the stunningly beautiful Pepper Potts). Fast-forward to 2013, days after of the Iron Man 3 release. Gwyneth Paltrow had become my celebrity obsession, Iron Man 3 was denting box-office, and reviews were pouring in claiming part 3 outgrew its predecessor. I saw it twice in theaters, enjoyed it, but found the entire experience to be polarizing. After living my infatuation with Gwyneth Paltrow for months, I decided to revisit the films and found my opinions to have morphed into new thoughts.IRON MAN (2008)I'm not a fan of superhero-origin stories, but with the original Iron Man, I never felt like the filmmakers woke up and said 'Let's Make a Superhero movie!' What the film implies the director and stars felt like when they started each day of filming is 'Let's make the best movie we can make.' Iron Man doesn't meander in scenes that are purely self-serving to remind everyone we're watching a superhero movie. Though it has its comic-booky undertones, Iron Man instead is an impacting, polished, and enthralling film about a man who finds redemption in an unconventional way. It's not about the 'superhero', it's about the process of becoming a hero. It's enjoyable spectacle, but also has a lot to offer its genre intellectually and creatively. Iron Man fits together as tightly as Gwyneth Paltrow's calves and is as clever as Downey's comebacks. While never feeling established as a genre picture, it fulfills every expectation you could have going in. Rating: 8/10Grade: A-I couldn't discuss the Iron Man films without paying respect to the comparison between this series and Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight series. I find the original Iron Man to introduce the story and develop it's characters better, even if it may lack the craftsmanship of Batman Begins. Nolan got the more impressive sequels, however. Contrast. Anyone can tell you that Robert Downey Jr.'s screen presence is what guided the series to the popularity levels it reached. Downey's effortless charm is so believable, it makes you wonder if he's really putting forth the effort in his acting or if he's playing an exaggerated version of himself. He has superlative chemistry with his co-star Gwyneth Paltrow and together, they are the pillars that ground the series. Both actors excel in the entire trilogy making the acting the most dependable aspect in the series. 'I watched the Iron Man movies to see Gwyneth Paltrow' said no one in history other than Ryan C. Showers.Even with two sequels that didn't live up to the standard set with the shining original film, it's a movie series that is a fun ride. Tony Stark is just as an amusing character as you will find in the action hero category today. The special effects are always worthy of our attention and the actors pull together something that may have been ambiguous on the page. Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and Iron Man 3 are blockbusters with a little more than you could hope for.",Null,2,3,5 August 2013
Blade Runner," Appropriately Questions the Future
","Blade Runner left 'Bigfoot' imprint on the science fiction genre 1982. Sci-fi flicks have a pattern of letdowns, but Blade Runner is something special, sustaining freshness when viewed in today's times. Ridley Scott's ambitious vision still questions the audience about the future when Blade Runner's version of 'the future' is less than a decade away from our time. Scott, though not restricted to the sic-fi genre, unlocks the director's comfort zone and possibly his area of interest. He has a certain feel to his films that can be linked together and recognized through the auteur theory. Blade Runner also weighs on genre theory in it's attack of the humanity's future in the science fiction category.The visuals for Blade Runner need not an extra injection of 'film-botox', the release year doesn't concern itself with the picture's longevity. When making the decisions for Blade Runner, Scott has his mind in the future imagining what the decor would look like, the clothing that we may wear, and the technology that could corrupt us. The obvious, blue-glow to the photography is beautiful and doesn't feel as cheap as other futuristic tales display their films. The selection of shots and cuts are placed perfectly, including the closeups I love from Scott's films. The sound echoes all the gadgets and violence a neo-noir-sci-fi film can release.Films that predict the future sometimes become cheeky and cryptic with what they want to say; thankfully Blade Runner sprints past those urges and gives its audience everything up front, though the quantity of what they have to spread is quite sizable. Will there eventually be a new race of humans? Are we becoming robots? Who is who? What makes us a human? What makes us a person? Can what we do change who we are? What are the limits of love? I'd even go as far to say Blade Runner hints around issues of race, homosexuality, and slavery. Ridley Scott is almost trying to ply open American's simple-minded views in 1982.Blade Runner is as artful as you can be without becoming pretentious. It's a film requiring your attention, thought, and repeated viewings. Don't worry it's still fun to watch; it has cool action scenes and impeccable blocking. The characters are enriched with feelings of the real world, which adds another layer of identification for Blade Runner's audiences to latch onto. From 1982's eye view, it appeared that Ridley Scott wasn't an optimistic onlooker of the years yet to come. Maybe his opinions were influenced by a vision of his later career never topping his work with Blade Runner and 1979's Alien.Rating: 9Grade: A",Null,1,6,1 November 2013
Before Sunrise," Like a flower, that grew by the seeds of life, and blossoms into love and happiness.
","The Before trilogy is a unique piece of cinema that is one of the most enchanted stories I've ever seen, yet I've probably never seen a fictional depiction of love ever expressed so genuinely or realistically. Before Sunrise was not a Box Office smash by any means, being independently made as well, it's kind of shocking that it spawned two sequels. But this is one of the rare times in our society a sequel was put into production because the audience they spoke too wanted more for the intellectual stimulation and embracing romance. It reached to a section of fans and critics ate it up. Thankfully, the team came backing punching the audience more with each film.'Stupid people talk about people, averagely smart people talk about things, intelligent people talk about ideas.' This quote has always fascinated me and is held true in each of the Before movies. Topics discussed here is what people should be talking about, not the latest petty gossip in their circle of friends. The key to total connection in a relationship is the talking about the mysteries of the world, human nature, and one's personal beliefs; that's what all three Befores cover beautifully. The trilogy's most pure nature is a collection of conversations between two people developing a romantic relationship through what they learn about each other. The dialogue was so engrossing that the entire first hour flew by and I hadn't written a single note on my legal pad. A movie where practically nothing happens would sound like a bore in theory and could even be a disaster in the wrong hands, but here it captivates the viewer.Each conversation the couple has, I identified with their thoughts; they may have been ideas I had at one time, a conversation I actually had with someone else, or something I've never thought of before that makes total sense about love, life, and personal psyche. This is what a great love story should be. This is what a great movie should be. This is how a great movie representing the building of a romantic relationship should be. The truth is, love means different things to us at different stages of our lives and the different stages of a relationship change the mood of said relationship, which is why all three movies make sense and are necessary.After I concluded my time with this Before Sunrise I thought, there's no way it could get better than this. Before Sunrise isn't just an introduction to the trilogy, it's a elegant tale of how a romance is first realized. Practically the characters have just become functioning adults in the world and in your twenties, there's still so much one doesn't understand about the life. The naiveness is captured, but with an intoxicating courtship. The screenplay is wonderful, featuring some magically written conversations that transcend the viewer into the souls of the characters. The romance has the most zest of the three films. Rating: 9/10Grade: AWatching character dive head first into conversations about life has never been so mesmerizing as it is in the Before trilogy. Communication is something lacking in society today, the Before trilogy shows us how a successful relationship is built: through talking. Julie Delpy and John Hawkes are transform into their roles and especially knock their performances over the fence in the last two films. The collaboration between two leading actors and the director, Richard Linklater, writing the later films results in a tightly told story that unfolds without fault. One thing that marks these films different from most lack of cuts within a scene. Many scenes in the Before trilogy run un-interrupted for ten minutes or more. It's very hard thing to do, but it's done with natural grace. With Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight we feel closer to life, love, and ourselves. The Before trilogy is like a flower, that grew by the seeds of life, and blossoms into love and happiness.",Null,0,0,30 July 2013
The Deer Hunter," Powerful
","The Deer Hunter is the type of movie that when you watch it you can't have anything else on your mind. Today's generation more often than not use their phones while they watch a movie, distracting them from the story at hand by text messages, social networking sites, and emails. When you watch The Deer Hunter, turn your phones off, put away the snacks, and empty your mind completely of any lingering predicaments they may have happened prior to sitting down to watch the film. The only way to experience The Deer Hunter is to live it.Director Michael Cimno is the showcased party from The Deer Hunter. The loose narrative allows Cimno to fully capture the characters, their struggles, and mental scarring. The script isn't cemented, which gives Cimno a lot of freedom. It's almost like we're watching a documentary of this group of people, the storytelling isn't very structured...but it works. I normally despise movies that don't get to the point they're trying to make, but The Deer Hunter struck me in a way no film of its nature has done before. It invested me into the lives of the characters, I really cared about what was going on, in a movie where not much does go on. The power Cimmo releases on the screen is admirable. The film's split into three segregated pieces: before war, during war, and after war. The Deer Hunter holds up the war to our faces and asks is this necessary? People who didn't go to war, get the point-blank experience of it through the film's gripping, raw, distressing transcendence of feelings. War changes people, we get to live that fully with The Deer Hunter. The first act, we get to know these characters as people. We identify with their day-to-day lives, living situations, and friendships. During the war, Cimno hits us with some painful scenes, including the iconic Russian Roulette sequence. It's an unforgettable, incredibly crafted scene in not just this film, but the war genre. It explores male sensitivity and the bonds that ignite in wartime. When the third act rolls around, it's about healing the scars from the war. You can see the scars every where you look. It's a catharsis of pain, loss, and mental disfigurement. Upon its release, controversy ensued due to the Russian Roulette topic covered heavily throughout the film. Apparently there was never any documented use of Russian Roulette and therefore the film was 'lying' to the viewer. I dissent these accusations because The Deer Hunter isn't giving a play-by-play shot of the Vietnam war. It's main purpose is to depict the impact the war had on the men serving our country and their families. The Deer Hunter is an fictional, emotionally driven movie, not a news special describing the types of torture methods used in the war.The Deer Hunter would almost be like an acting exercise for its principle actors. Getting to live the big picture of a character, not just the crux of a story that we usually get in movies. The actors here are allowed to experiment with the characters at uninteresting moments and still create drama within those moments. When Robert De Niro puts himself in a role, he doesn't look back. De Niro's strength and susceptibility in the war scenes move your heart around in your chest. Meryl Streep gets to show off in her first meaty role, supplying each moment with a different level of emotion. Christopher Walken has the most complex character and performance; the transformation that his character lives is astounding. The actors bring this movie to life by falling back on the mission statement of the film: to show the effects of war on human beings. There's a specific technique Cimno uses with The Deer Hunter: lingering emotion. As the scene lingers on, emotion grows, and you become overwhelmed by the amount of response you feel in your heart to this film. The extreme length has been highly criticized by moviegoers, and usually I'm one of those people complaining about the unnecessary length in a movie, but here it feels right and is wonderfully fulfilling. Sure, a trim here or there wouldn't have hurt, but Cimno gets away with it because of the robust sentiment. It's a destructive piece that tears into your soul. Not having a distinctive narrative voice, the Cimno is the one who makes the movie the commanding experience that is The Deer Hunter. Some shots are so intense and violent that you shutter at the pain you're watching, but others are beautifully moving it creates a peace in our mind. Filled with numerous sublime performances, a tremendous view on war, and moving tales of the human condition, The Deer Hunter only has a few missteps along the way. You won't soon forget this film, as it will be tugging at your emotion strings long after you complete the movie. Rating: 9.5/10Grade: A",Null,0,3,6 July 2013
Saving Mr. Banks," Thompson Brightens Up a Flawed Film
","I admire John Lee Hancock for his willingness to tackle sentimental, sugary, and heavily cheesy scripts as a director because that tone will reflect on his direction. Though Saving Mr. Banks is a step in the right direction from reprehensible 2009 Best Picture nominee The Blind Side, Saving Mr. Banks has its problems most of which accumulate in the flashbacks that parallel the dominant storyline. In fact, if the flashbacks would have been eliminated entirely, Saving Mr. Banks could have been a charming, meta-tale that film fans could devour like last year's Hitchcock (which I adore).Faults aside, Saving Mr. Banks is a warm tale featuring a soulful musical score, kooky hairstyles, and fun set designs. Tom Hanks suits his role of Walt Disney and has a few monologues where he puts the optimism and cheerfulness he hinges on for most of the film aside and creates something exceptional. Emma Thompson is rightfully soaking up most of the acclaim for Saving Mr. Banks. Her terrific portrayal full of snootiness and cruel comedy is made complex by burying sorrow and pain deep in her character's past. The concluding scene is so effective because of the truth Thompson displays.Saving Mr. Banks is about letting go of the past, accepting it, forgiving those who have hurt you, and resurrecting yourself. The other, possibly more lucrative, message: Walt Disney is the cure for all children's misfortunes, even children in their old age.Grade: BRating: 6.5",Null,0,6,31 December 2013
Lucy," The more 'Lucy' stews in your head, the more you'll find yourself loving it.
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERSEarlier this week I updated my daily attire with new glasses. 'Lucy' is the first movie I saw since the transition between spectacles. Not only did I feel as if I was watching a movie with new eyes, but the film showed me something that I have never seen before. The undeniable fact of 'Lucy' is its ingenuity, but be warned, it is a polarizing experience.Though I hardly find it as trend-setting as some suggest, feminism is embedded deeper within the film than the drugs are planted in Lucy's stomach. The explicit female empowerment almost becomes cheeky satire, such as when Lucy's love interest addresses his expendable nature in the plot, but her response insinuates the best use of his existence is to kiss her while she fights the bad guys. (Women Studies professors across the country will be giddy after seeing 'Lucy'.) It's incorrect to pretend as if females have not led science fiction/genre films before, especially films that acquired a lucrative gross at the box office. Though Johnasson's Lucy is only a descendant of people like Ellen Ripley, this film's success could turn the tide away from the frequency of male dominated action thrillers.The first twenty-five minutes of 'Lucy' are unbearable. The film's opening moments begin with calm images over Johansson's voice, whispering ideas emblematic of evolution, but that lasts for only moments. The story plunges its viewer into an obnoxiously directed, jarringly edited, and bombastically scored chaos. It would be acceptable if someone were to walk out of 'Lucy' during its introductory scenes, even if they would miss the fun surprises to be had later in the film. During the crucial, plot-setting scene, Director Luc Besson interweaves shots of a cheetah killing its prey into the sequence, a pompous move that sinks 'Lucy' to its lowest point. It's almost as if Besson was testing his audience through endurance experiments during the first 25 minutes, before getting to a film that wasn't actually that bad.The quality transition from act one to act two and three is one of the most drastic in recent memory. 'Lucy' began as a discomforting experience, but something happens after the dust settles from the storm of act one. The material is given the space it needs to breathe, Besson takes his dead weight foot off the gas pedal, and 'Lucy' begins to fly. In the second two thirds of the film, the tone is infused with real emotion, campy fun, and soothing tranquility. Besson relinquishes his domineering approach seen in the earlier scenes and lets the erroneous ideas speak for themselves. The film concludes with a sensational montage that exposes the radical ambition behind 'Lucy'.For however disproportionate the film itself becomes, the one constant is Scarlett Johansson's drilling performance. Johansson can add 'Lucy' to her string of hits recently because in this role she shows emotion in the most melodramatic ways I've ever seen from her as an actress. In addition, she builds a grounded, cold state of omnipotence in later scenes of the film, creating a nice emotional range within the movie and the character.'Lucy' has ideal pacing and storytelling methods, clocking in its running time at 89 minutes. Sure, the introduction was a bit disorienting in its eagerness to jump immediately into the rising action, but that's a forgettable flaw once the running time minutes begin to rack up. It comes and goes swiftly and pragmatically, and maybe that's something future films should try to emulate, in addition to the female dominance. The more 'Lucy' stews in your head, the more you'll find yourself loving it.* * * out of * * * *6.9/10",Null,2,7,9 August 2014
Amélie," Respectable fun!
","From the first blazing shots of Amélie, I knew that I was in for a two hour visual delight. As the film begins to tell its story, I realized I was in for a narrative delight as well. Add the delightful facial expressions from Audrey Tautou and you'll be scrambling for a synonym, but not finding one that quite sums up the film as well as delightful.The popping feature of Amélie that makes it such an enjoyable experience is in which the manner it's told. Exaggerating the quirks of each character it introduces, Amélie expresses that everyone has weird things about their personality that make them their own distinct person. This allows the movie to be quite funny and slowly tug the audience in its corner.Amélie has a lot to tell the audience, a lot to show us, and a lot of magic to create. It almost acts as a French fairy tale with the different visual techniques it uses to bring out intense emotions of the characters, or the precise camera angles. Amélie is about communication and affection. Amélie has been lacking affection since her childhood, therefore she lacks the communication skills to interact with anyone socially.Though it may not be an accurate depiction of every day French life, Amélie passes by fast and whether it's your brain, eyes, or heart talking, you love each minute. Amélie undergoes some inconsistent tonal changes in Act Two, which temporarily separated me from the world I got to be apart of. Nevertheless, creativity bursting through France's café shops, Amélie respectable and fun!Rating: 8.5/10Grade: A",Null,0,2,4 September 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," What We've Been Waiting For
","Warner Brothers and the Potter team underwent a lot of unfriendly publicity when they decided to split J.K. Rowling's final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, into two separate films being released at different times. Outraged film journalists and bloggers claimed they were trying to gripe up as much currency this series could stretch out. However, after seeing both films, I understand and fully support the decision. This allowed the first film to slowly develop the thick novel's plot and gave everyone the room to breathe, and the viewer could following the plot without any confusion. Part II succeeds on even greater scales.I saw Deathly Hallows Part 2 in theaters, the night it was released, at midnight, and after being a casual fan of the first seven films I never felt more satisfied, enthralled, or excited by a movie before. This is how an epic series should end. No matter what movie series your loyalties like with (Scream, Batman, The Godfather, Spiderman) every fan deserves a conclusion to their series like the one Harry Potter has achieved. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is what the characters and story have been geared toward for seven movies, what the filmmakers have been waiting to tell for seven movies, and what we've waited to see for seven movies. The aspect most present in Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the pathos plugged into every second of the film, making the story and the characters float on top of the emotional tone. The filmmakers treat our emotional equilibriums like horcruxes they have to break to assure the success of the picture. Trust me, every horcrux will be broken in your theater. Deathly Hallows is a wonderfully mature film, thankfully releasing itself from the family adventure it began as. The beginning films were wonderful for what they were, but Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the ripe entry where we witness the darkness we've been told about since the first days of Hogwarts. The darkness that is tapped into through the mood of the picture makes us feel like we weren't just hearing Wizard-urban legends for a decade.Deathly Hallows Part 2's biting force is the direction by David Yates. Having a rough time adjusting to the series, Yates is in his element here combining his style with dramatic emotion, war action, and finality. The fight between Harry and Voldemort has been blueprinted since the day we signed on to be fans of the series, being the last film we know it's coming, we just want to get there. In J.K. Rowling's novel, there are a lot of twists that derail the plot from reaching that climax, but Yates paces them in such a way that makes them tolerable and even involving. Yates hits the hard scenes with just as much of a punch in which Rowling wrote them.J.K. Rowling deserves a moment of silence for crafting this series, it's all her imagination and work on the screen. The history Rowling has thought up cracks through this installment beautifully. Part 2 brings back all the memories we made those first six years at Hogwarts and incorporates them into the plot. The characters feel complete, particularly Alan Rickman's Snape. Maggie Smith proves she's still a badass in Professor McGonagall's olden age. The only flaw with Rowling's source material is the film is occasionally stuck with cliché choreography within the written story and the character's not staying true to their realistic humanity. It's not a colossal flaw, but something most adventure-fantasy epics get wrong. Thankfully Harry Potter only floats into this in short occurrences. The most respected aspect of Harry Potter's success in the film community is the advances and proficiencies in its production values and technical aspects; the final installment don't dare slack. The set design is unbelievable, all the sets, not even just the Hogwarts castle (which may be at its best with the film's in-depth showing of destruction of Hogwarts). The photography is something Potter has improved the most on, here it sweeps the audience away like dust by a broom. The special effects are also a benchmark for the series. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, the worst-case-scenario becomes a reality within the Wizard world. The more pain the characters are plunged into, the more the story is plunged into darkness, the more the film ties the viewer to its internal heart. The emotion it reaches for an fantasy picture is remarkable.he final entry of Harry Potter brings out the big guns and it has more gusto in its destructive action sequences than most Greek tragedies. Harry Potter was never given the same red carpet treatment Lord of the Rings was given in its shorter run, which is a shame because Deathly Hallows Part 2 is better than anything those three films dished out.

Unbroken," So Flat That it Might As Well Have Come in a Cardboard Box Mailed to Jolie's House
","BY RYAN C. SHOWERSThe trailer for 'Unbroken' did not fool me—I knew something was off from the overly sentimental and uninspired footage months ago. After seeing the film though, I was correct in detecting the film's mediocre quality but not for the reason I thought. Angelina Jolie's directing style, as demonstrated with 'Unbroken,' is to make the audience respond to her. She wants to see us flinch, jump, and wince. In theory, this sounds like a good quality to have, right? Well no, not if it's the only quality you have to engage the thinking viewer.Imparting the intensity of a situation seemed to be on her agenda as the primary objective. In this regard, 'Unbroken' does impale us with the extremity of the airplane scenes, the deserted emptiness of the ocean, and the grueling torture Louis Zamperini endured. (The ultimate 'jump scare' of the film is when a shark attacks the survivors of the airplane crash on their raft. Everyone, and I mean everyone, in my theater leaped out of their seats.) The problem with her work in 'Unbroken' is that the emotional narrative is left astray. Though Louis remains 'unbroken' by the actions committed against him, Jolie never lets us inside Zamperini's mind and shows us how he internalizes this physical and emotional pain. The dramatic moments that would have serviced this aspect of the story are deserted by Jolie, and instead, she leaves us to just witness the atrocities Zamperini valiantly overcomes. The action is there, but the emotions and understanding are not.The worst thing about 'Unbroken' is the ghastly screenplay, a text that surprisingly took a total of five writers to compose fully. This script is one of the worst adapted screenplays 2014 saw. The film's structure for the first half an hour is pointless, flashing back in time while relating nothing from said flashbacks to the present day scenes. The dialogue is terrible; clichéd, cheesy conversations and motivational phrases guide most of the narrative (including the unforgivably trite name-calling, bullying, homosexual jokes). The most damaging of it all is the lack of actual plot of which the movie is made up. There is no coherent 'storyline' but rather a collection of events that one man was able to withstand.Jack O'Connell does a fine job in portraying Zamperini, but his acting can only take the characterization so far. The characters in 'Unbroken' are so flat and one-dimensional that they might as well have come in a cardboard box mailed to Jolie's house. The closest thing to an attempt at humanizing Zamperini is by alluding to character flaws through dialogue and that he sneaked alcohol in a milk-bottle as a child. Otherwise he's always seen doing the right thing, being a model for us mere mortals to emulate, and always remaining 'unbroken'. The supporting characters receive even less development. The main antagonist, revoltingly played by Miyavi, is given no justice whatsoever.Jolie, herself, has proclaimed that the message of 'Unbroken' is the power of forgiveness, yet I struggle to recognize this supposed ultimate-metaphor considering the portion of Zamperini's story that displays his forgiving of the captors is only shown at the end of the feature in the form of title-cards. 'Unbroken' is actually a loosely-written, action-dependent film about how one man surmounts insurmountable physical plights. The movie Jolie describes was actually made and released earlier this year, 'The Railway Man', starring Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman.Having addressed all of my problems with the final product, I must say that 'Unbroken' is technically apt and deserves Oscar nominations in cinematography, original score, sound mixing, and sound editing. (These technical elements are most utilized in the captivating plane scenes that open 'Unbroken' and the most of the raft scenes.) The photography illustrated by the great Roger Deakins is especially beautiful and artistic, and the sound design will ring your eyes and pin you to your seat.'Unbroken' is intentionally epic, almost to a fault. You will grow tired of it by the third act, all of Jolie's tricks will be behind you, and you will be ready to pack up and leave. Grade: C+* * / * * * *",Null,7,16,30 December 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A monument of a film.
","Magical is the simplest way I can describe the finale to one of the greatest trilogies in film history. It's visually astounding with narrative focus, that's matched with masterful directorial effort. The Return of the King is the best of the three 'Rings' and turns the classic novel into something that will be treasured for years and years to come. The film opens with a flashback to Gollum's past, it's a great move. We had an idea in our minds of how Gollum stole the ring, but we get a full-fleshed scene to how it happened. Great way to open the film. The sets are amazing, the costumes are stunning, the cinematography is rich and stylish, the special effects will blow you away, the editing keeps everything alive. It's flawless. It's the most technically advanced film *ever* besides the recently released 'Avatar'. It's special effects create not only an adventurous fantasy tale, it's a completely different world. Peter Jackson takes you there and you have the time of your life.Sean Astin really steps up his game for the finale, and deserves an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Speaking of Oscars, Peter Jackson should've had his Best Director's speech written right after the editing was finished. It's his crowning glory. The Return of the King is a grand film that should be celebrated not only for it's visual achievement, but also on acting and storytelling scales. It's emotionally powerful and has a sense of humor. It's too long like the past two films, which is a flaw, but I wouldn't lessen its overall grade because of it. It's such a landmark in film history, so authentic especially for a fantasy film.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," An example of what a blockbuster should be.
","As the lights dimmed and I relaxed in my seat, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire began with a long shot of its heroine, Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), crouching on a rock in the wintery forest. This silhouette of Katniss in the center of the screen melts your eyes with its bleak poetry and allowed me to set aside my prejudgments about this sequel based on a best- selling teen novel series. This single shot sets the tone, expectation, and the precedent of beautiful cinematography that lay ahead. The original film is more of a served as a solid teen film, I sustained a moderate anticipation for the sequel, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. I was not prepared for the gusto the director, Francis Lawrence, was going to deliver. Lawrence thankfully replaced Gary Ross, the director of original film.District Twelve Tributes Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have won the Hunger Games by feigning the world of their undying love. Their victory against the Capitol has resulted in the beginning stages of a rebellion amongst the citizens. The leader of Capitol, President Snow, orders Katniss and Peeta both justify their actions in 'cheating the system' by proving their love to be legitimate. For the 75th Hunger Games, Katniss and Peeta are thrown back into the Game, facing off against previous winners as their opponents.Catching Fire digs deeper into the themes dug by the original including totalitarianism, reality TV metaphorically killing our youth, and the false implications that are intertwined with a celebrity image. They own what they are looking to explore and do not compromise insightful art for gushy romance and violent action. The love that Katniss and Peeta find in the sea of false feelings and acting may be the most honest thing the series has to say. It's not love at first sight. The irony is Katniss and Peeta are forced to display a celebrity image of love. What the audience expects from their relationship is an immediate external attraction, but they find love in seeing the other person underneath, a lesson of life and love we learn as we mature. Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence produces her best acting performance to date in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire. She has the strength to carry Katniss and her newfound psychological traumas while owning her role as leader. What Sigourney Weaver accomplished in Aliens is similar to what Lawrence displays in Catching Fire, she's given the opportunity to vamp up the pathological expressions of a damaged woman after establishing her character in the original film. Post-traumatic stress is a favorite concept of mine to explore with female characters in sequels. Lawrence both reveals and hides that vulnerable side of Katniss, behind the shield of her stubbornness and aggression. Lawrence succeeds where Kristen Stewart failed in leading the Twilight series. Like the original film, Katniss has a specific feminist character arc she must fulfill; Lawrence subtly tracks that arc in each scene and turning another beautiful acting job. Though I think the pop culture immensely overreacted to Lawrence in the past two years, she has the mark of a great actress, one that will be a gem her generation.I am crazy about the sinisterly beautiful cinematography and the emotional film score of Catching Fire. The sets are ravishingly decorated, the costumes are bombastic, and the make- up pays attention to smalls details. Catching Fire has the occasional missteps, though they are thin and widely dispersed. A problem from the original film that is rectified in this sequel is that the first 80 minutes have a story to tell and don't read like a directions manual to a board game. The Hunger Games as a series grew up a great deal in the small time frame between the first and second films. Catching Fire is not a teen film, it may have been written to be, but the film emerges as a permissible addition to great science fiction adventures in cinema. Will we look back and think that Catching Fire changed the world? Is it important art? No, but it's the most entertaining film of the year and the blockbuster that stands tall amongst a sea of misfires.Rating: 8Grade: A",Null,5,20,19 December 2013
Casino," Great, but Great to Scorsese is Mediocre to The Everyday Director
","Trust. The fascinating theme and moral reassurance for Martin Scorsese's attempt to hit critics and audiences as hard as he hit them with his classic, Goodfellas. Unfortunately, his arm isn't strong enough to smack the audience on that level. However, he does leave a great impression thanks to his style, control, of course the two components that make his films the best of the best: his film editor and Robert DeNiro.In Spanish, 'money' is translated to 'diniro'. Hiring Robert DeNiro to star as the leading role in a film centered around gambling. The irony is fascinating. Thrown into a role that is more simplistic than past roles Scorsese has put DeNiro front and center for, DeNiro delivers the goods and is the MVP in Casino, when his two co-stars are given much more to raise a circus with. Speaking of, Joe Pesci. While one may question the actor's range with his role choices, no one can deny him the praise he deserves at knocking these types of characters through the wall and then some.Talk about more irony. Sharon Stone was the only cast member (or crew member for that fact) to receive an Oscar nomination for her work in Casino. She gets to cry, she gets to yell, she gets to do drugs, but hardly is she ever to scratch below the surface and bring something real out in her character. Ginger is resorted to Stone's awkwardness on the screen, struggling through scenes other actresses could've killed by throwing a hissy fit. She doesn't work in the role. Not that the role isn't rooted in clichÃ©, unoriginality, and lacks the development needed to make this trite stereotype a quality character.Much of the film is montage with narration guiding the viewer through the quick action. Scorsese films have tightly strung editing, but nothing ever like this has been produced before. The film barely gives us full length scenes until the last third, but those are drown in Stone's distracting acting efforts. It's a complete mystery to me how Casino was shot and edited; there are so many scenes to get caught up in that last 20 seconds at most some of them. Major props to the editing and Scorsese. I'm aware giving Scorsese praise in that fashion is redundant and expected with each film he directs, but here it's earned considering this is one of his weaker efforts.The film's running time is a monstrous one, and coming from a person who checks their watch incessantly in a film that's over two hours, I didn't feel the length once. It kept me interested and invested in the happenings of the story. The viewer almost rides it like a raft down a river. But, just because it's watchable doesn't always mean it's worth watching. In this case, it is worth the flaws. Flaws, in which the film erupts with as does the opening scene's car bombing. The story is fun, minutely intriguing, and entertains us with the back dealings of Vegas and then seem. But somehow the story and the characters sometimes feel like they are struggling to stay above water. Casino is very reminiscent of The Godfather and The Godfather Part II, homaging the plot arc, specific scenes, themes, subject matters, and the iconic endings.When I was growing up, my mother demanded respect at all times. Even when we were giving her respect beyond any of our peer's efforts for their parents, she still never felt it was enough. She was never going to be satisfied For DeNiro's character, Trust is his version of my mother's trust. He falls in love with Stone's character, knowing her tarnished reputation and her art of conning, but still he chooses to marry her and forces her to be loyal to him. Deep down he knows that he shouldn't trust her, but he lives reality as if she was worthy of his trust. Just as the average joe wants to believe Vegas is an honest place and in gambling you risk it all, but as the saying goes The House Always Wins. Perhaps DeNiro strives for personal strivings for trust result from his view of the unlawful acts of the city. Even though he tries to maintain legitimacy in his end of business dealings, maybe real trust cannot be found in Las Vegas.RATING: 7.5/10GRADE: B+",Null,0,1,2 June 2013
Heat," A slick, polished thriller
","Movie fans and film snobs already acclaim Robert DeNiro and Al Pacino as two of the best actors in the history of entertainment. From the past experience of putting them in the same movie, The Godfather Part II, magic is bound to spark. While Heat isn't quite what one would assume it to be, it succeeds at being a mature, emotional experience that defines itself at the top of the action genre for years to come. Robert DeNiro has a beef with politicians during elections: they tear their opponents down and sacrifice their dignity instead of trying to prove themselves to the American people. Heat is an action thriller with dignity. While other action movies are concerned with what neat stunts can they throw at the audience, Heat internally speaks to the viewer as well as bringing well choreographed action scenes.Director Michael Mann, makes Heat more personal than most action thrillers. In fact, Mann doesn't tell the story as if it were a action movie at all. He tells a story centering in on the lives of two men who are connected by a few pieces of action. Mann delivers the film with a tense feeling, and establishes a gloomy tone. The engrossing score is cautiously placed the in the correct places. Heat succeeds technically, as well; the sound quality that adds to the excitement of the action scenes. The suspense is successful because Mann creates the film's tension sensitively. All the action and suspense is met perfectly because of the tender touch of Michael Mann. DeNiro and Pacino lead the adept cast creating one heck of an acting ensemble. Al Pacino has moments of greatness, but those are contrasted with some cringe-inducing moments. His highs are pretty high though and make up for the brief moments of instability. DeNiro, playing the darker character, is solid and consistent from his first scene to the last, giving him DeNiro the slight edge over Pacino. Both are great actors doing great work. Like their first appearance together, The Godfather Part II, they each lead their own section of the film, but in Heat they come into one-on-one contact half-way through the movie. It's a rare scene when the cop and the bad guy sit down for conversation and coffee.'Don't let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you the heat around the corner,' is a line said by Robert DeNiro's character that resonates a lot of what the film is about. Heat is a slick polished thriller that holds carefully plotted action scenes while packing a powerful punch in the topics of abandonment, life, and admiration. The last scene's poignancy solidifies Heat as a movie to remember.Rating: 8/10Grade: A-",Null,1,4,14 July 2013
50_50," Slowly inflicts the pain of the disease onto the viewer
","Having four people in my family fatally suffered from cancer, I was hesitant to watch 50/50, but thankfully it clarified some of the pain cancer patients go through. The biggest thing that is repeated throughout the film is no one knows what to say to someone who has cancer. It's the most honest thing featured in the movie because it's the most unanswerable situation you could be caught in. Anna Kendrick makes you smile as you try to hold back the tears, once you get that gulp in your throat. Angelica Houston is the MVP, delivering a fully explained character in a matter of three scenes. Joseph Gordon Levitt approaches the role delicately, which is very satisfying when he finally explodes. 50/50 slowly inflicts the pain of the disease onto the viewer, much like how someone would experience cancer.Rating: 7/10Grade: B+",Null,0,1,15 August 2013
Inside Llewyn Davis," Holds Filmmaking to High Expectations.
","I imagine the inspiration for Inside Llewyn Davis hit the Coens one night when they were letting folk music saturate their souls. Inside Llewyn Lewis is like a folk song acted out on screen. It may sound like a journey that isn't worth venturing on, but Joel and Ethan Coen have a nack for telling simplistic stories in an artful way. Though this film does not conquer relatively recent masterpieces such as No Country for Old Men or A Serious Man, Inside Llewyn Lewis is another bulletproof tale for the Coen brothers to add to their protracted resumes.The title holds no hidden meaning, the audience shown the story from within Llewyn's perception. We are immersed in an unimaginative world through blue-tinted cinematography that highlights the faces of the characters as ghost pale. Incredibly beautiful and unique photography that feeds an underwater feel to the viewer, adding to the isolation and lack of direction Llewyn feels. Adding to that, Oscar Isaac portrays Llewyn, a performance that feels extremely personal to its audience. The frequent, tranquil folk songs create the rhythm of the picture, soothing the audience for approval, which it earns. The screenplay is an odyssey of searching for life direction, a story that would be truly gloomy if it were not for the Coens everlasting Fargo-esque, awkward humor. The comedy is sinfully funny and fits in between moments of drama. The Coens' screenplay explores the lead character's dark period wisely without abandoning their audience, only aided by the adept directing. Carey Mulligan, who's performance shattered the screens with a strengthen arm in 2009's An Education, shows worse sides of her acting abilities as time moves her on. Here, she receives scenes of anger to bring to life, a task that obviously was asking too much of the actress by the Coen brothers. Mulligan actually detracts from the film. One knows it isn't a good sign when Justin Timberlake upstages an Academy Award nominee...with less screen time than her. Inside Llewyn Davis is an easier sell to audiences than most of the Coens work, but illusion of the ending may send audiences scattering. The approach is performed well by the Coens and could actually be seen as quite smart, but it's a move that could confuse audiences not anticipating a bit of trickery. I have thought on the ending since seeing it, there are different interpretations audiences can embrace, I do not know which I side with at the moment.The film follows emphasizes a cat as symbolism for the lead character, they build a strong comparison case. I think the Coens have proved to deserve a reserved spot on every critic's year-end top 10 list with their multiple films having a consistent quality. It seems the directing duo can do no wrong. They have expressed their range now, yet with all their films they retain an auteur trademark of an 'earthy' atmosphere. A reliable film for those who appreciate the craft being held to high expectations.Grade: ARating: 8.0",Null,1,3,10 January 2014
Her," Endearing Romance
","Colors, colors, colors. Her is a color-dependent film saturated with reds, pinks, blues, oranges in the set design and the tricks of light it finds in the cinematography. As great looking of a film as it is, Her also acts as a reinvention of a tragic love story, unconventional yes, but that doesn't mean it isn't filled with just as much love as Casablanca or Titanic. Spike Jonze's screenplay is as essential to Her as Alfonso Cuaron's directing and vision was to Gravity; the film soars on the strength of its script and the ideas it explores.I criticized Rotten Tomatoes for using this phrasing in describing the consensus of The Master, but if you are a 'serious' cinema attendee, then watching Her with an a 'non-serious' and vocal audience is more distracting then it would be in a zone free of judgment. Everyone feels the pain of the world, but some do not understand why we feel that pain or that others have extreme cases of that ache what feel. Such as viewers of Taxi Driver who look at Travis as a stalker of Betsy. Her is consumed with Theodore's loneliness in a less subtle way than Taxi Driver, which made my audience see him as a pathetic creep. Her is a funny, satirical film, but not a film to mock the situation of the protagonist.Developing legitimate feelings for a piece of technology is unheard of in our society today, but with an open mind (which Her warrants) the audiences can identify with Theodore and let your brain flow with the questions Jonze's screenplay asks us. With Theodore's occupation of writing sentimental letters for other people to give to the ones they love: are we becoming so communication inept that we can't even explain our own sentiments? On Samantha's role in Theodore's life: if our computers filled the social void in our lives....would we need any other humans? The most important question Her asks is do we forget what it means to be alive? This message is where the emotional sensitivity of Johansson's faceless performance touches audiences. Do we take our individuality, struggles, past, present, possibility of a future, and body form for granted? The dynamics of humanity are thoroughly explored including selfishness and disappointments by the three main characters played by Johansson, Joaquin Phoenix, and Amy Adams. Johnasson's acting range anguishes the audience to empathize with Samantha, proving her voluptuous body is just a plus to make men fall in love with her. Phoenix is further than from any material he's portrayed recently and excellent at doing so. Director Spike Jonze sets his film in the future, maybe he wants to make a prediction after noting the reliance on technology to make our lives function. The truth is, the world is made up of lazy people, when there's a shortcut to get to information, we grab it without looking back. But the more access we are permitted to technological advances, do you isolate ourselves as a result?Love is infinite and we should obtain it in whatever manner makes us happy, we have to deal with the consequences. The art of communication is not lost forever, but only needs to found again. Her is a poetic film that explores human beings from the inside out. There's a sequence that I do not care for that involves Samantha seeking out a body for Theodore to use as a substitute for her, that demotes the film a tad. Even with those ten minutes, Her is an endearing collection of true romance. Grade: ARating: 8.3",Null,1,3,11 January 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," The best action film of the decade
","The Bourne Supremacy in a few words blew me away. It's absolutely magnificent. I was worried because the first is so strong that the sequel may be disappointing. Not in any sense of the word. It's better than the first with a thick storyline, more suspense, new characters, and great action sequences. I knew the fate of one of the main characters (from Identity) before I saw this, and I didn't expect to see it until at least the third act. It happens in the first 20 minutes, which surprised me. That was the first sign that this was going to be a great, different film. Matt Damon delivers another solid effort as Jason Bourne. He's so nonchalant in the role fits it to a tee. Joan Allen makes her first appearance in the Bourne franchise here as Pamela Landy. She's fierce, driven, and delivers a kick-arse performance. She's not given much to work with, but she overcomes that and stands smiling in the end. Supremacy is a near-perfect action-thriller film. It's smart, especially for it's genre. There's many twists and turns, and great plot points with performances that deserve more than what they get. I only have one small complaint: there is an action sequence that lasts way to long and drags a bit. It's near the 90 minute mark and it's duration is around 10-15 minutes. It's well choreographed, but could've been cut in the editing room. Other than that, there's not much more you could ask for, and the last scene between Allen and Damon is nothing short of phenomenal; 9.5",Null,1,3,5 August 2010
The Proposal," Entertaining eye candy.
","The Proposal is charming as hell. Ryan Reynolds and Sandra Bullock are loads of fun as the leads. They make you smile every single moment while you watch this movie. Does it seem ridiculous at times? Yes. Is it clichéd at times? Yes. Is it worth your time? Yes.This is a film, where it doesn't require you to think. You can just kick back, relax and laugh. And laugh. And laugh again. Bullock got a Golden Globe nomination for her work here. She's sexy, funny, and likable. Reynolds is so handsome and charming it's impossible not fall for him watching this here. Betty White gets a supporting role and she is flat-out hilarious. Overall, it's a solid film with a hot cast, everything you could want in a summer film. My biggest problem here is the forest scene between Bullock and White. It's laughably bad. Other than that, see it; 7.",Null,1,1,1 August 2010
The Birds," Terrifying, an excellent horror movie!
","The Birds: I've always been aware of the existence of The Birds and the reputation it held amongst Hitchcock fans. I was not ready for how fantastic it actually is. I was terrified during the film, absolutely frightened by the mere sight of a bird. The build-up is what makes every moment as scary as its reputation says it is. You have the empty feeling that grows in your stomach when you know something is going to happen, and then when the birds would finally take action, I literally shuttered and flinched. I felt like the birds attacking me as I was watching it, I could feel them digging into my skin because the atmosphere is created so well. Hitchcock once said it was the most terrifying movie he's ever made, he was correct. The special effects of the birds are something quite remarkable for its time, unbelievably believable. The Birds takes it time to develop the storyline, but I never lost interest. The script fully realizes and understands its characters, just as good, if not better than any other Hitchcock picture. Tippi Hedren is phenomenal as the lead in the film. My favorite Hitchcock lady. She's not the typical heroine, she has rough, unpolished edges to her, but she makes the movie all the more engaging. I loved every second of The Birds, though the one compliant I have is that it feels a manipulative many times using children as the targets of the birds. I thought Hedren's scenes were better. It doesn't detract much from a excellent horror movie.Rating: 10/10Grade: A+",Null,1,2,14 August 2013
