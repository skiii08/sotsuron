The Hangover," One of the funniest move i've ever seen
",Extremely funny highly recommend for comedy lovers. It's an 1hour 30 mins of comedy roller-coaster.,10,1,1,13 March 2019
The Hangover Part III," 1 & 2 is Damn Hillarious 10*s but Hangover 3 is waste of time.
",Don't like the story at all seems the movie is made in rush.,2,0,2,13 March 2019
