Kill Bill: Vol. 2," To anyone who has anything negative to say.
","I would like to comment on Kill Bill: Volume 2.  I was surprised to see a few other users commenting about this film negatively.  Although entitled to their opinions, I feel that they do not show this second volume any justice. First of all, Kill Bill: Volume 2 is equally as excellent as Kill Bill: Volume 2.  There is simply a different atmosphere, to a degree.  Your enjoyment of the film is what you make it.  Tarantino finds it necessary to show a considerable amount on Budd, but I do not see how it slows the movie down.  Kill Bill: Volume 1 has fast-paced parts and slow-paced parts, as well.What most people do not understand is that although this is a revenge movie, there should be no major issue about sympathy or empathy with the Bride. The issue, rather, is WHY she is doing what she is doing.  Unless you are involved completely in the life as an international assassin who is among a social group of outstanding martial arts experts who are assassins themselves, you cannot begin to understand the complexities involved.  The Bride and her enemies have totally different mindsets than the average commoner in society.  The Bride's issue is 'kill or be killed' and as mentioned within Kill Bill: Volume 1, all human emotion and compassion are compressed within a warrior's mind.  Things happen in this world that are right and that are wrong.  If someone wipes out a person's family, two wrongs don't make a right, but that is beside the point in these movies. It is arguable that just there is a time for peace, love, sadness, war, famine, etc., there is a time to fight...and yes, a time to kill.
Finally, Tarantino is telling a story in HIS very own unique and brilliant manner.  I myself felt sympathy with the Bride in Volume 1, but I feel that that was not Tarantino's goal, so that is merely a side effect.  The movies seemed to be different simply because of the EMPHASIS on different characters.  Each Death List Five character has a different amount of emphasis...so any issue of HOW LONG TARANTINO DECIDED TO STRESS A CHARACTER'S PERSONAL STORY is irrelevant and unnecessary.",10,0,1,9 May 2004
