The Monuments Men," Review: The Monuments Men/ www.nightfilmreviews.com
","Through his career as an actor, George Clooney has offered audiences with a well-to-do list of fine performances that bring to life vivid influential fictional and exciting non-fictional characters. There is no doubting that currently Clooney is a highly regarded, respected and powerful force within Hollywood. And thankfully his work as an actor has yet to be complete. It is in my humble opinion that Clooney, as a director, has excelled in the medium quicker than as an actor of his time. As a director, Clooney has elevated the mainstream storytelling technique as well as contributes to having a tremendous, natural execution of developing his characters, especially when it comes to telling the true stories of some of the most influential behind-the- scenes men that were born and raised in the United States. Clooney's intent in his films is to preserve culture, history, and a way of life, bringing to life as well as sharing the many amazing stories of men (and women) who make him proud to call himself an American.From Chuck Barris, creator of the Gong Show and supposed CIA agent (played perfectly by Sam Rockwell) in Confessions of a Dangerous Mind; to Edward R. Murrow, the man responsible for the censure of Joseph McCarthy and McCarthyism (played gallantly by David Straitairn) in Good Night, and Good Luck; to Dodge Connelly, a mimic of Herald 'Red' Grange, an icon of American football (played by Clooney himself) in Leatherheads; to Senator Mike Morris (Clooney) in the political-thriller The Ides of March based loosely on the 2004 Democratic primary campaign of Howard Dean, Clooney has quite the knack for bringing to life the controversial stories of some great American men and their great patriotic accomplishments and failures.With The Monuments Men, Clooney finds hints of the potential essence that surrounded his greater directorial body of work, but unfortunately, falls into a formulaic routine that solidifies the film as a quasi-informative, melodramatic and somewhat predictable clichéd piece of American cheese. Bound to make its way into library halls and fall under the categories of 'forgettable' and 'unaffecting', The Monuments Men becomes an outdated artifact of recycled ideas that would see itself in the historical section of the museum collecting dust and being completely forgotten in the years to come. With scenes as predictable and numbered as the Dewey Decimal System, The Monuments Men is still a hard film not to like. Lead by a profound group of talented actors, the film tells the true life story of a small group of men who searched high and far through the immense rubble and destruction of the Second World War for the very fabric of humanity, culture and history. Lead by Frank Stokes (Clooney) and his hand-picked team of artists; James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Donald Jefferies (Hugh Bonneville), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and the young Sam Epstein (Dimitri Leonidas), the main objective for the men is to safely find, preserve and return famous and amateur art; art that Hitler was stealing with the intention of opening up his own museum.One of the biggest reoccurring elements throughout the film is the value of human life and the value of art. Clooney, throughout his narration, continuously makes clear that no artwork, no matter how valuable, is worth a human life. Yet, this statement seems somewhat impossible and disapproved during one of the most notorious wars in the history of world, responsible for countless casualties. Although stark and heart-warmingly affective, the narration by our protagonist serves as some of the films most thought-provoking segments of the film, yet takes away from the actions depicted on screen. The narration instead serves as an almost 'in case you missed it' captioning to the often times laughable and overly-comedic action on screen.Like with any Clooney directed feature, he is always able to round out a talented and multi- faceted cast that sometimes drive the stale action and narration itself. Comedians Bill Murray, John Goodman, Bob Balaban, as well as recent Oscar winner Dujardin, deliver an abundance of unneeded comedic relief that often takes away from the heavy subject matter and serious drama the film is attempting to sculpt. Finding the humour and humanity of a war that didn't seem to have much during its occurrence, The Monuments Men is a light-hearted take on a solemn historical piece of time.Having the only female lead in the film, Cate Blanchett proves here more than anywhere, even amidst all the comedy and juvenile goofiness, that she is next in line to be our generation's Meryl Streep. Camouflaging herself in her French accent and wholly Parisian character, Blanchett is one of the film's saving graces. The other, as always, is the charm and bravado of the always impressive Matt Damon. Although mocked throughout the film for his horrendous French accent (now that was funny), Damon allows the imperfections of his depiction of a very real American solider to navigate through the progression of the story's conflict with ease. His scenes end up becoming the crucial developments for his company of men, whereas most of the other characters rely heavily on luck and good fortune.Check out the full review at www.nightfilmreviews.com",7,3,6,13 February 2014
Captain Phillips," Review: Captain Phillips Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","I'm not sure if there is some sort of unwritten rule in Hollywood to pump out glorified films of American icons or a quota for the 'Based On A True Story: American Hero' genre. With the likes of Olympus Has Fallen, White House Down, and G.I Joe: Retaliation, there is only one way to distinguish these films from the likes of Captain Phillips, and that's the talent behind, and in front of the screen.Captain Phillips is a clever, beautiful and meticulous piece of American propaganda. Brought out by its studios Columbia Pictures and Sony, it tells the story of a Captain of an American cargo ship being taken over by a small and young band of inexperienced Somali pirates.Think of it like this; the film is directed by Paul Greengrass, the same director of United 93, a film that recounts the efforts of average American passengers foiling the plans of foreign terrorist plans during 9/11; it stars our generation's own Humphrey Bogart, and arguably the most recognizable American actor right now, Tom Hanks, and its produced by the team behind other contemporary American classics like The Social Network. So why is Captain Phillips sinking right out of the water?I know that, for the most part, I will be in the vast minority with my viewpoint on the film, already gaining critical praise and reception from early festival screenings and talk, most noticeably for Hanks' performance. But what about the performances of the practically unknown, amateur and first time Somali actors who, not only hold their own beside the masterful Hanks, but at times tower over time like a freighter ship beside a life vessel. Pirates Muse (Barkhad Abdi) and Bilal (Barkhad Abdirahman) stand out more than the other two pirates, but as the award season nears closer, I am sure neither of these names will be announced as serious award contenders when the time comes.What is most disappointing about Captain Phillips is its massive potential. The film starts off, giving the audience equal screen time to both the protagonist and antagonist, showing the lives of these two very different men and the 'jobs' they must perform in order to survive. One individual is a captain of a cargo ship who steers heavy waters to get shipments into port on time; the other is a fisherman who is violently forced to become a Somali pirate for a larger, more corrupt entity. Greengrass and screenwriter Billy Ray briefly touch upon the incongruencies of both men's worlds and different upbringings as well as viewpoints, but, shortly after, is drowned with scenes of unapologetic American patriotism.As for Tom Hanks, well, Hanks does what he does best throughout the course of the film. There is no denying Hanks as a powerhouse actor and fine entertainer, just not with the presence of other actors. Some of Hanks' most memorable and recognized performances (Cast Away, The Terminal, Cloud Atlas) are ones when he is interacting with only himself. Captain Phillips is a testament to that notion; delivering his best and most emotional scenes in either a lifeless life vessel or disoriented and unresponsive to an aiding nurse, Hanks delivers his signature Tom Hanks characteristic, just with a different accent.Unfortunately for Greengrass and company, Captain Phillips is an unaware, self-reflexive, continuing practice of the 'home of the brave and land of the free' stretching its muscles. Just last year, making its premiere at the Venice and Toronto film festival circuit, a Danish film, titled A Hijacking made its rounds internationally, and then shortly after, in a limited theatre bout. The film never found footing after its critical praise and strong reception from audiences. The trailer is also oddly familiar to the style and narrative of Captain Phillips. Yet again, the Hollywood studio system just goes to show that with the right actor and precise director, no idea is safe of Hollywood's ongoing obsession of being uncreative.Emotionally charged, suspenseful and paced brilliantly, it is hard to ignore Captain Phillips as one's familiar, unsteady first boat ride–it may be a bit nauseating, rough, and hard. Making you reconsidering jumping on again.Night Film Reviews: 5/10 Stars",5,16,33,11 November 2013
Lone Survivor," Review: Lone Survivor/ Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","The war film genre is one where the sensationalisation of the gains and losses on the battlefield and highly fictionalized moments drenched with brotherhood, duty, and honour, are what differentiate it from other film genres. Sadly, Lone Survivor is no different from the many other war films that have come before it. Despite its lack of originality in a genre that has, for the most part, run out of ammo in the originality department, one of the advantages that the film has compared to more recognizable battles of the past, is the obscurity of Operation Red Wings (the mission the film is based on) and the lack of mystery as to who lives and who dies.Lone Survivor tells the story of Operation Red Wings, an American search-and-destroy mission in Afghanistan, and focuses on the four men sent in to do the job. Giving a little insight into the lives of Petty Officer Second Class Danny Dietz (Emile Hirsch), Petty Officer Second Class Matthew Axelson (Ben Foster), Lieutenant Micahel Murphy (Kitsch), and Petty Officer First Class Marcus Luttrell (Wahlberg), the film is a comical and brutal account of the ethical decision-making on the battlefield and the impact of certain 'rules of engagement'. Within the war film genre, death is inevitable and thanks to its spoiler-laden title, audiences already know that only one of the four main protagonists actually comes away with his life. However, by taking the focus away from the mystery of who lives and who dies, the film is able to quickly establish heartfelt connections and deliver a deeply emotional response, even if the roles are played by not so emotionally impacting actors like Taylor Kitsch and Mark Wahlberg.As the opening monologue of the film echoes in its first few minutes, 'There's a storm inside all of us; a burden, a river, a drive, an unrelentless desire to push yourself harder and further than anyone can think possible'. This storm, this drive, is one that can be appreciated through the growing body of work of writer/director Pete Berg. Berg has made a career as Hollywood's go-to director for entrusting soaring production budgets and seasoned action stars, while confidently obtaining a great box-office return, despite dismal or mixed reviews. From Friday Night Lights and Battleship, to the out of nowhere mega-blockbuster Hancock, Berg has been fortunate with large scale budgets and generous star power behind his films. Spanning the course of five years, Lone Survivor is Berg's passion project. Working for the Director Guild of America with minimum salary, Berg was instantly drawn to the memoir of Marcus Luttrell during the production on Hancock. After proposing the film to Universal studios, and getting stars Wahlberg and Kitsch at a discounted rate, the funding for his film was the only reason Berg actually agreed to make Battleship.The film is being hailed as an authentic representation of the encounters many US Armed Force Officers are faced with. Although at times repetitive, the film is a bustling, hard-boiled piece of the American military life and a look into the lives of these triumphant men and women. Filled with moments that will have you clenching your fists and lifting yourself off the seat, Lone Survivor is a true testament of the artful representation of violence–proving that in Berg's book, moderation is definitely for cowards.Much like the highly overrated Captain Phillips released earlier in the awards season, the film really does not shed much light or give any insight to the antagonists of the film–the Taliban. Pursing Operation Red Wings for the sheer fact that their target is notorious for killing off Navy SEAL's, the four men are tested; mind, body, and soul through a perilous journey where their actions dictate the consequences of their future. Other than a scene involving a decapitation of one member of the Taliban as a supposed traitor, the film's first half shows the target Shah (Yousuf Azami) and his heartless second-in-command Taraq (Sammy Sheik) as diabolical animals. It isn't until we reach the last part of the film where the true nature and over- embellished actions of the Afghani people are accurately depicted.Despite the celebrity status of the four leading men, the real stand out is the always camouflaged Ben Foster. Taking queues from his career best The Messenger back in 2009, Foster brings a vulnerability to his role as Petty Officer Axel, one that quickly outshines his male cohorts. Foster's interpretation of inevitable death and the persistence to keep fighting for his country, is one that out-guns anyone else in Lone Survivor. When the mission is compromised and the four men are forced to decide the fate of the three civilians they take captive, the film with an obviously overcasting American attitude, becomes even if just momentarily, a quite reflective art-piece. Thanks to the memoir of the only surviving member Marcus Luttrell, the film highlights the fundamentals of the Afghan culture as well as highlights and gives due diligence to the reason for his survival–which comes as a big, pleasing, politically correct surprise.2014 has just begun, and although the film premiered to a selecte few audience members in 2013, I can confidently stand by my opinion that the film will offer one of the best photographic opening montage credits scene of the year. Showing the gruelling world of these Navy SEAL Officers who abandon all physical and mental sanity is portrayed in the opening credit sequence as a tactical and highly effective way to introduce audiences to the real world of pain, adrenaline, and perseverance many American men and women face when becoming SEALS.Contrary to what people may say, Lone Survivor surely will not be a serious contender at this year's Academy Awards although the film is one that pushes its audience relentlessly to the far corners of their comfort zone and forces them to endure the hardships these men, along with many Afghani people, constantly face being abraded by the Taliban.",7,0,5,16 January 2014
The Impossible," Review: The Impossible--A By The numbers, emotional journey of faith
","Driving on intense emotional pain, explicit physical human damage and unbearable scenarios of brutal tragedy and deep suffering, The Impossible is a truly independent disaster movie minus any Hollywood trans fat. Absent of absurd fantastical elements plaguing high-end disaster movies in Hollywood, The Impossible is a film which uses the real disaster of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and one family's compelling true story of survival that surfaced cause of it. The Impossible may not be the best disaster movie ever made nor may it be the greatest parable for the strength of family and the bonds of community, but it sure as hell makes for one deeply satisfying emotional tale of endurance and hope. Re-Telling the story of Maria Belon's family's inexplicable survival, The Impossible is a retelling of one family's journey during one of the worst natural disasters ever recorded. Belon, along with her husband, were vacationing in Thailand from their busy lives back home in Japan. Caught without any warning, Belon and her family held on long and hard enough to live to tell the tale of there family's unbelievable tale of survival. Drenched with compelling special effects and outstanding stunt work, this was second in comparison to the stellar showcase of Naomi Watts' acting range. Being in front of the camera the longest and having her story told for the majority of the movie, Watts was harrowing as an injured mother clinging on to her life for the sake of her children. Accompanied by one of the stand-out performances by a newcomer this year, Tom Holland who plays Watts' son Lucas and her sole companion for the first half of the film, was completely on-point and the two were a dynamic acting duo. The two performances sparkled with life and ingenious moments of sheer beauty. Ewan McGregor did his best and held his own with what seemed like ridiculous plot- points for a father and very little screen time with two child actors (Oaklee Pendergast and Samuel Joslin) who were significantly overshadowed by Holland. The film itself owes great credit to its sophomore director Juan Antonia Bayona, whose direction is strategically planned and appreciated throughout the film. Dealing with a narrative with so much room for emotional manipulation, Bayona masterfully paces the film and its stars for small yet powerful instances of truly great human feats. The Impossible is a gut-wrenching and heart breaking marvel of a film. Layered with multiple challenges of the people who struggled to survive during a time of hardship and tragedy, The Impossible is a tale of true possible hope for the good in all people to shine. Challenging in not only content and the visuals it presents to the audience, the film is a challenge for people to accept and believe that good exists within everyone, especially during times of strife and extreme hardship. Physically challenging and magnificent, The Impossible is a true example of a small scale film doing it right with large scale heart.",7,2,3,21 February 2013
The Danish Girl," TIFF40 2015 Film Review: The Danish Girl
","Tom Hooper seems to be the period piece go-to director for by-the-numbers Oscar films. After the immense success of the little indie that could The King's Speech gaining massive momentum at TIFF in 2010, going on to win the coveted Best Picture Oscar; then the grand and highly ambitious Les Miserables, Hooper seemed to have crafted a career out of production rich designs, strong performances and historically relevant social issues in his films. With the addition of Eddie Redmayne, fresh off his Oscar winning role in last year's The Theory of Everything, Hooper's newest The Danish Girl was expected to come out a clear winner. Sadly, The Danish Girl is a confused, highly theatrical and poorly constructed transparent film with laughable dialogue between its two leads Redmayne and rising star Alicia Vikander. The Danish Girl seemed to be a foolproof, sure-fire bet for success; Redmayne was coming off his Oscar win as Stephen Hawkings; the first look photo of the film of Redmayne in drag gained immense buzz online; Hooper finally got a project off the ground after many years of being shelved by studios and various directors; its female lead Alicia Vikander had four major roles in 2015 with nothing but great buzz, and finally, the cast rounded out with the grandly talented Matthias Schoenaerts. Yet, Hooper's The Danish Girl came across as a forced, highly contrived Oscar wannabe film with pretentious camera tricks, dizzying angles and weak vehicle for any kind of lead up to have Redmayne the first actor to win two back-to-back lead actor Oscars.Set in 1926, in what could be described as Hooper's historically hipster-era in Copenhagen, the film follows Gerda Wegener (Vikander) and Einar Wegener (Redmayne), a very passionate, close- knit painting couple who cherish the high art culture of Copenhagen, including its posh parties, galas and presentations. Along for the ride, is their close friend and confident floozy Oola Paulson (Amber Heard), who motivates the couple to partake in the lavish cultural niche of the country, without much else.In a desperate attempt to finish up a recent portrait for her upcoming, impending gallery showcase, Gerda asks her loving and supportive husband Einar, to place the painted dress on, along with some nylons and heals. As Einar caresses and is seduced by the fabrics of the garment, he becomes transfixed, mind, body and soul, with the crazy idea of becoming a woman. As Oola enters the couples apartment, in preparation for another trendy evening gather, jokingly names Einar's female counterpart Lili. Unbeknownst to them at the time, the origins of Lili would just be the start of Gerda's and Einar's life.Transgenderism is a huge and highly talked about social issue in many art forms today, especially within the visual medium. With shows like 'Transparent', 'Orange is the New Black' and others making waves, it's no surprise that Hollywood busted out an origin film of one of the first successful trans-gender stories and operations recorded. Sadly, The Danish Girl, while trying to be trend-setting and a wavelengths type film for the truly difficult realities for many, serves as a laughable and pretentious story of over-dramatic film aesthetics and acting.Scorn with painful editing, inauspicious mood-setting scoring and less than hubris camera angles and filing styles, it seems as though Hooper forgot to focus on his characters and their difficult and revolutionary small details. For example, when Gerda tries to persuade Einar to coming to a party with her, which he declines vivacious, she convinces him to come as Lili, for fun and merely as a joke. While Einar's transformation and changing montage is brief, unlike those clichéd high school prom films that has the big transformation of its lead female protagonist as she goes from ugly duckling to beautiful swan, Lili has no big reveal; merely a quick shot of her walking the streets, rushing to the party with Gerda. Hooper takes for granted so much of the importance of Einar to Lili, and focuses on a very muddled and hard to define relationship between a man and a woman; lovers to friends; wife to cousin?Danish pastries are famous for being laminated, multi-layered and delicate. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for The Danish Girl. Burnt to a crisp with overacting and some poor make-up and costume choices, the film does offer some saving graces thanks mostly to an astonishing performance by Alicia Vikander and Matthias Schoenaerts, and a very special and one of the rare believable scenes of Redmayne through a looking glass. Vikander, who counterbalances Redmayne's manic behaviour and inability to vocalize how he feels he is meant to be a woman, Vikander's gentle touch to Gerda's character brings true emotions of how any partner and loved one would deal with a very radical decision today, and more so in 1926 Europe. Vikander, who is bound to land some Oscar love come earlier next year, gently graces the screen with perfectly timed drama, poise and a gentle touch. Schoenaerts, who is a period-piece veteran, offers his masterful acting skills as an old-friend to Einar and new friend to Gerda, playing a very similar role as Charlie Cox's character Jonathan in The Theory of Everything, his passion to aid, understand and stand on the sidelines of a very unique circumstance is one of the winning areas of the film.",5,1,2,3 February 2016
About Time," Review: About Time Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","If you were able to travel back in time to the past events of your life, what exactly would you change? In Richard Curtis' new time-travelling romantic-comedy, Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) decides to go back and change his life, all in the name of love. Not that he could really go back and 'kill Hitler or shag Helen of Troy', as his father suggests.Since the early 2000′s, the British romantic-comedy is becoming as much of a staple in the genre than any piece of American rom-com cinema has recently, disregarding the American romantic indie features. Whether it be the cute accents, the ginger-bred protagonists or the intricate unique narrative tropes which excel certain points of the love story, those British buggers are succeeding in a genre that generally lacks such a large emotional response in big- budgeted Hollywood films.In the film, aspiring law student Tim lives with his parents (played eloquently by Bill Nighy and Lindsay Duncan), his free-spirited sister Kit Kat (Lydia Wilson) and Uncle Desmond (Richard Cordery) in a charming home overlooking the bay in Cornwall, England. On the morning of Tim's twenty-first birthday, he is summoned to his father's study only to be told that the men in his family have the amazing ability to travel back in time, within the timeline of their own lives of course. In utter disbelief and against his will, Tim follows his fathers instructions; finds a dark place, clenches his fists and thinks back to New Years Eve, only to rectify his mistake of missing out on kissing a beautiful girl at the stroke of midnight. Enchanted, he returns to his father exclaiming, 'It's going to be a complicated year', where his father replies, 'it's going to be a complicated life'.About Time is a charming, utterly tender tale of life, love and the extraordinary of the ordinary. Much like the narrative of the film, Tim travels to the past and back to the present to perfect all the imperfections of his life, yet the film is anything but perfect, and that's OK. Suffering from inconsistent plot-points to breaking the rules that the film outlines, About Time is surely not a tightly-constricted narrative leap for the genre by any means. Regardless, the film casts an enchanting spell that not only lifts one's spirit, but causes you to merely forget about the rules Curtis makes, and breaks.Writer/director Richard Curtis has had quite a bit of luck in the romantic-comedy genre, making major waves penning Bridget Jones's Diary, Love Actually, Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral. Although he has stated that About Time will be his final directorial venture, only behind the aforementioned Love Actually and Pirate Radio, Curtis has succeeded well beyond many of the directors and screenwriters who hoped to successfully recreate anything Nicholas Sparks' has made, with the exception of The Notebook, of course. Fresh, spontaneous and demanding emotions, Curtis has brought new light to the British romantic-comedy front and has made the kind of films one isn't ashamed to laugh and cry at.Once Tim finally meets Mary (Rachael McAdams), Tim knows he has found the reason to adequately use his time-travelling powers. At first glance, Gleeson and McAdams seem like a poor physical match for a film that at times could be distracting or awkward. Instead, much to the extent and reality in life, the two feed off one another's unique characteristics splendidly. Tall, pale and with a hint of orange hair, Gleeson's unique on-screen charm is brashly alluring. McAdams on the other hand, stripped of all glam and instead substituted with a rather rag/tag girl-next door look, reminds us why she is cast in these roles and how easy it is to fall in love with her – quirks and all.McAdams, who is no stranger to the time-travelling love story narrative, venturing in her third quest as the desired love interest, first in the Time Traveler's Wife and two years later in Woody Allen's acclaimed Midnight In Paris, enchants and reminds us just how adorable and likable she really is in these roles. Bringing a believable essence to the role of Mary, McAdams just may cement herself in time as the go-to, romantic-comedy poster girl.As a love story, About Time succeeds. As a tale of morality, a lesson on making each day your last and as a film about the bond between father and son, the film triumphs. Gleeson and Nighy share some of the most sentimental and heart-wrenching moments of the film that are sure to get your eyeballs sweating with joy. Incandescent as father and son, the two actors shine as the heart and soul of the film.As the pendulum swings closer to the end of the year, About Time will surely be atop my list of guilty cinematic pleasures of 2013, especially since I am such a sucker for hopeless romantic love stories with an underlining patriarchal theme. About Time may be a highly decorated cautionary tale of the beautiful moments in everyone's seemingly mundane life and the short time we have to live it, but the film, whether romantically tied or generationally suggestive, is a movie about appreciating the little things. 'Some days you want to re-live forever. Some days you want to live once', and Richard Curtis and company really hammer that notion home with their newest film. Essentially, About Time is really all ABOUT LOVE, and we are alright with that.Night Film Reviews: 9/10 Stars",9,3,6,11 November 2013
The Hateful Eight," Film Review: The Hateful Eight/
","Watching a Tarantino film is a cinematic experience, better yet, a right of movie-passage; an experience that may not be as recognizable or appreciated now by the vast majority, but can surely be pointed out and appreciated by a fine few who can find similarities and influences with some of the last great auteurs and great directors of the past. And yet, like his films, Tarantino intended to present his sly and ultra-violent eighth film in the most roadshow way possible; with an overture, intermission and in 70mm no less. Maybe your wondering, after eight films, has Tarantino out done himself, especially after the exceptional critical and commercial praise of Django Unchained, for which he won an Academy Award in the Original Screenplay category? The answer my friends is, as Samuel L. Jackson so coyly says within the first lines of the film, 'Got room for one more?', cause Tarantino ain't going anywhere yet!Tarantino's newest film, The Hateful Eight is every bit as brilliant, violent, unapologetic and masterful than his last, plus some. Writing in a way that can only Tarantino can write, The Hateful Eight proves that the master scribbler has no intention of letting up, or letting lose of his racial, sexist and down-right offensive subject matter in his older age.But before we get into all that, lets take a little history lessonBack in 2014, the original script for the film leaked online, which gave Tarantino a very easy choice to make, he scrapped the project in pre-production altogether. Opting to make the film a novella instead, a cast was chosen to give a brief reading of the script in LA. The cast, who is almost identical to the final cast seen in the film, with the stark exception of Jennifer Jason Leigh, who replaced Amber Tamblyn in the read as Daisy Domergue, as well as the addition of Demián Bichir and a super secret role of Channing Tatum, The Hateful Eight saw the light after all. Thankfully, after a very successful and publicized read, and with the help of the convincing of good friend Samuel L. Jackson, a frequent collaborator of Tarantino, the writer extraordinaire re-wrote the first draft of the script, created two new alternative endings, and announced his plans to continue with The Hateful Eight as his next film. Alas, here I am today.The film, which circles mostly among eight main characters, tells the story of a hangman, John 'The Hangman' Ruth (Kurt Russell), who is notorious for claiming his earning with subject who are alive, and his seamlessly impossible quest of getting the wanted Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a woman convicted of murder, to the proper authorities for a hefty bounty. Unknown to him at the time on his way to Red Rocks, Colorado, Ruth's coach, steered by the steady O.B Jackson (James Parks), encounters one helluva winter storm. Untrusting of anyone and everyone, except O.B, the storm swallows the travelling companions of two men; Major Marquis Warren (Samuel L. Jackson), also a bounty hunter, with some precious cargo of his own, and one Chris Mannix (Walton Goggins), an ex Lost-Causer militiaman who is on his way to Red Rocks to claim his new badge as Sheriff and inevitably, issue both Ruth and Warren, their bounty prizes. Too many coincidences yet? Trust me, we are just getting started.As the two horseless men make their way on Ruth's coach, Ruth makes an alliance with Major Warren, to both protect their bounties from anyone threatening to take it away from them. While the three men bond in the most bizarre ways, Mannix, an ex Confederate, laughs in the face of Major Warren and his conquests during the Civil War, showing just how stormy the next chapters of this epic story will actually be. As the storm takes a turn for the worst, the coach and all its occupants are forced to seek refuge in Minnie's (Dana Gourrier) Haberdashery, a cozy and warm little stagecoach lodge the middle of nowhere.Once settled, paranoia levels are high while we are introduced to the rest of Tarantino's Hateful Eight. Among the new eight are; Joe Gage (Michael Madsen) a quiet man who so happens to be at Minnie's on the quest to see his mother; General Sandy Smithers (Bruce Dern) an old Confederate General who is just being cozy playing chess; Oswaldo Mobray (Tim Roth), the hangman responsible of the actual hanging of Daisy once at Red Rocks, and my personal favourite Bob The Mexican (Damián Bichir), the only person in charge of running Minnie's place while she is 'conveniently' away with her husband Sweet Dave (Gene Jones). Once the already inhabitant guests greet the new coach full of killers, bounty hunters and coachmen, the stage is set for one of the best whodunnits films in recent memory.Essentially, this is Tarantino's first attempt at a mystery film and without question, what a success it is. As expected, Tarantino, arguably, one of the best actor directors working today (and even possibly, of all-time), assembles a stellar cast full of vivid characters who, may not be are favourite group of individuals, ones we aren't suppose to like much, but end up loving, regardless of their intentions.",10,5,13,3 February 2016
The Book Thief," Review: The Book Thief/Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","There are movies that can be put in a category appropriately labelled 'Oscar bait'; and if there is one film that exemplifies that best this year, it is The Book Thief. Just like any cold or flu, 'Oscar bait' films have very clear symptoms. For starters, setting the film during The Academy Awards' favourite time in history, World War II is a must; having a young lead performance is another; previous academy award winners and nominees within the cast (in this case the illustrious Geoffrey Rush and the always impressive Emily Watson) always helps; and finally, the icing on the cake is the heavy-handed and manipulating (to the point of distracting) forced drama (in this case, a completely unnecessary voice-over). Put all those factors together and you have one of the most formulaic and familiar films during Oscar season this year. Read more!I have not had the pleasure to read Markus Zusak's supposed enthralling source material in which the film is based off of. The novel has received an overwhelming amount of accolades for presenting a story through the perspective of an unlikely narrator, but within Brian Percival's cinematic adaptation, unfortunately, this narration is far from effective.The Book Thief is by no means a terrible film. Mediocre at best, the film is a slow, long-winded feature that check-marks most of the essential plot-points of its far superior World War II predecessors. With just over a two hour run time, The Book Thief uses morbid images of death, sometimes involving children, to get its dramatized point across and elicit notions of pure sentiment.The film follows Liesel Meminger (French-Canadian Sophie Nélisse from Monsieur Lazhar), a newly orphaned child who is in the midst of pre-war Germany in 1938. Liesel is sent to live with a new family, Mr. & Mrs. Hans Hubermann (Rush & Watson) and like any child her age, she is very much reserved towards the strangers she must now call her parents. Hans does everything in his power to comfort his new daughter, finding a common passion in literature. Liesel, who is unable to read before she arrives to her new home on Heaven St., seeks the guidance of her new father, and together they find a small solace amongst the raging political ideology and war propaganda within Germany at the time. As you would expect, Liesel befriends a young, lemon- haired boy Rudy (Nico Liesch), and together the film recounts the innocent relationship these two share during one of the most atrocious times in our world's history.The scenes between Rudy and Liesel are some of the best within the film, surely capturing the simplicity of children trying to make sense of a very complex time. The very fabric of the relationships and loyalties between the people she holds dear to her are tested with the sudden arrival of Max (Ben Schnetzer), the son of an old friend of Hans. With cultural tension and war on the rise, Liesel and her family must turn a blind eye to patriotism in favour of humanity, finding a new way to survive without ever compromising their own integrity.Some of the finer points of The Book Thief comes from its impeccable acting talent. Nélisse embodies the young heart of Liesel and makes the character her own. While Rush and Watson make the best of the material they are given, Rush is always shining, capturing our hearts and the heart of Liesel any which way he can. His affections are as sweet as the lumps of sugar he magically surprises her with.Light on any real emotional responses, The Book Thief will less than likely make a dent during the award season. It'll probably be left mostly forgotten by the time nominations come early next year.Rush is a fine actor joined by an equally talented cast. Despite the great acting unfortunately, The Book Thief will surely be crippled for its clichéd war narrative that we have seen time and time again. Applause is surely warranted for choosing to focus on elaborate set pieces, excellent production design, authentic filming locations in Berlin and talented actors, however the film neglects its chance to actually drop any emotional bombs on its audience.",5,7,15,1 December 2013
Suicide Squad," Film Review: Suicide Squad
","In a world where audiences cannot get enough of superheroes, comics and geeking over the impossibly feverish fade of comic book hero's adapted onto the big screen, DC Comics is trying to cash in on this highly lucrative cinematic craze by developing a feature length feature, and their competition to The Avengers with Suicide Squad. Yet, if we really look at the bigger picture of Suicide Squad, one can easily see some stark differences, for example; none of the characters are really superheroes but villains; none of the characters presented are really recognizable names, with the exception of The Joker (who isn't even a member of the squad in the film) and Harley Quinn (who is destined to become a household character by the end of this film, with the help of Margot Robbie of course), and, if not most importantly, assembling a team together, including cast and crew, that couldn't be more, disassembled.Quite frankly, Suicide Squad is a complete disaster and mess of a film. The writing of the film is so incoherent, it makes the objective of the team and the audience really question as to why they are doing it altogether. The direction of the film feels forced and almost lacking any artistic creativeness by David Ayer and more-so of a forced studio film shoved down the artistic team's throat, and, the story is just convoluted, discombobulated and weak. Ayer, who was on my radar of becoming one of my fav directors, blending, almost effortlessly, the use of action with real-world comedy, thanks to the near-perfect End of Watch, shits the bed on this one.With such star power, including the uncompromising Will Smith, Jared Leto, Margot Robbie, and the once attached Tom Hardy, you would think Suicide Squad was a film with some massive potential to wreck box-office havoc at the end of a very disappointing 2016. Yet, the film itself is a very sad excuse for a summer blockbuster, insulting its audience with any sort of artistic and cinematic credit.While the narrative of the story has been told before, like seriously, almost exactly like the narrative in the first Avengers. Just to refresh, here is it; A loved one of one of the team members (Thor's brother's Loki in the Avengers and Nick Flag's (Joe Kinnaman) girlfriend June Moone, also know by her villain name Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) in this one, wreck havoc on a city, a team gathers to save the city (New York City in the Avengers, Gotham in this film). Coming out of the gates, the film does not have much street credit.Suicide Squad was easily one of the most anticipated and exciting movies of summer sixteen. The trailer, which features one of the best bands ever assembled singing one of the best musical arrangements ever created, was easily one hell of a ride to watch. Unfortunately, some of the best parts of the film were featured in the trailer, which took away and ruined the film overall, or, the music just brought the best in the footage. After all, its pretty hard not enjoying watching anything while listening to the angelic voice of Freddie Mercury.While the movie did feature the likes of Viola Davis as Amanda Waller, the sadistic mastermind behind the formation of the Suicide Squad, in a compelling and completely engaging role as a devilish, heartless and soulless women, who takes her job WAY too seriously, the only real redemption the movie has is Will Smith and Margot Robbie, and I mention those named quite carefully. Notice how I didn't say Deadshot and Harley Quinn, the characters these actors are playing. Smith, who is an excellent actor whom audiences love whole-heartedly, did not play an interpretation of the almost obscure comic book character. Smith, in turn, essentially just plays himself, in a film adaptation where he must kick ass, save the world and give the occasional motivational speech. Its hard not to like Will Smith in anything really (we will completely ignore After Earth), hence why much of the good criticism will come from him, but people will quickly forget that Will Smith is a likable guy, but did he give a spot on, target approve depiction of a DC comic book baddie, heck no.With Margot Robbie, one of the hottest and most attractive Hollywood actresses working today, its hard not to like her in anything, especially when for the duration of the film, she is featured in very sexy short-shorts and ripped nylons, as well as while the camera takes the liberty of shooting her from behind most of the time. Geeks and fanboys, compose yourself! Again, Robbie, A HIGHLY alluring and charming actress, who, if wasn't already, will surely be a house hold name after only one studio film, plays the best version of herself, with some sort of an accent, doesn't really play a version of the iconic sidekick to The Joker, rather, just an amazing companion to Deadshot, which shouldn't be hard, especially since the two have shared the screen before in Focus, showing the same caliber chemistry as Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling. The chemistry between the two is so good, it comes to no wonder why Jada Pinkett Smith was worried when rumours were circulating about affair rumours between the two.",2,0,0,9 February 2017
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Film Review: Captain America: The Winter Soldier/ www.nightfilmreviews.com
","The future sure has been quite a time for Captain America (Chris Evans). His first encounter with the modern world saw him running through Times Square, confused and scared. Next, he assembled with some other Superheroes to save the world from the disgruntled brother of a fellow Avenger. In Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Cap faces off against an internal threat and an organization that is just as powerful as S.H.I.E.L.D, as well as a familiar face and new adversary from his past. Life is rough for Cap. On top of everything, he is still trying to find a way to successfully assimilate himself into present day society. You think saving the world is hard? Try figuring out the internet, getting back on the dating scene, and making new friends at the age of ninety-five. Thankfully, there are only a few things Cap needs to get through the day; his trusty vibranium shield and his handy notepad with a slew of suggestions for catching up with the last seventy years, and Cap is ready to take on the world–or corrupt government organizations. Either or, Cap is always ready to save the day, even if he has to take a beating while doing it.When I first became aware that the directing/producing brothers behind episodes of 'Community' and You, Me and Dupree were going to be responsible for extending the Captain America canon, I may have gotten a little worried. Thinking that Joe and Anthony Russo were going to follow in the same footsteps as Captain America: The First Avenger director Joe Johnson, focusing more on the comedy and special effects of the Superhero genre and less with the complex, unflinching patriotic mentality of America's greatest super soldier, the Russo brothers sure proved me wrong. It's movies like these that make happy to swallow my words and stand corrected, knowing that audience members are able trust that the television medium is one that can be used as an adequate platform towards advancing characters in film as well.Substituting as much VFX work as possible for a very organic and old-school action approach, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is certainly the best Phase Two Marvel film so far, and may perhaps be the standard film to compete against in a post-Avengers film world, or at least up until the Avengers: Age of Ultron. Always on a mission, it seems that Cap lives to work, not works to live. Especially since he has been in deep sleep for the last little while. While the United States government is surely getting the most out of their ridiculously expensive investment, the government trusts that their super solider is never compromised and his dedication and hard work to his country is never skewed. When a secret organization with similar interests to those of S.H.I.E.L.D threaten to kill twenty million people, Cap is sent to fight at sea, on land, and in the air. Accompanied by his trusty sidekick Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), the two seem to always be pitted within the same missions but always having ulterior motives. Commanded by their one-eyed superior Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), S.H.I.E.L.D must face off against their most ruthless enemy yet.One of the biggest issues I will continue to have with Marvel's stand-alone films from now on, is the fact that once conflict reaches a certain level of danger, like lets say a global level, I will always ask, 'Where the heck are the Avengers? And if not the Avengers, where is Tony Stark? The Hulk? Someone? Anyone?' No problem could be too big for the super-powered team of freedom fighting Superheroes. This is one film where I questioned the presence of Tony Stark? Was he just waiting to see what Cap would do on the other side of the country while he sat at home on his couch?Essentially, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is a team effort in crime fighting, with Black Widow and Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) helping out are star-spangled Superhero this time around, Cap sure doesn't seem to be without powerful friends. What was also refreshing was finally seeing Nick Fury get in on the action, providing the film with one of the best car chase scene Marvel ever assembled. One of the virtues of Captain America: The Winter Soldier stands by is the fact that, you don't need to wear a mask to be a Superhero–which might explain why Cap always insists on removing his.At times, the film may seem like Marvel's take on Minority Report anticipating danger before it even happens, and upholding the idea of 'peace' for the sake of the world. But as the Head of S.H.I.E.L.D operations ironically points out, 'peace is not an achievement, its a responsibility'. So when S.H.I.E.L.D is corrupted from the inside, right under their noses and Cap is left to face-off against a super-soldier baddie, later known as the Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), the organization really has some explaining to do. The Winter Soldier, developed and equipped with the same agility as Cap, with of course the addition of a metal arm, the masked soldier gives Cap a run for his money. The only person the Winter Soldier ever seems to have any trouble fighting is Romanoff, which raises the question, why doesn't anyone give her the serum to make her a super-soldier? She would surely kick some serious ass!Can't get enough Captain America? Check out the rest of the review at www.nightfilmreviews.com!",8,0,1,4 April 2014
American Hustle," Review: American Hustle/Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","The heist film genre is one of the most exciting film genres in recent memory, thanks to the likes of elaborate minds and stylistically driven directors. From Soderbergh's Ocean trilogy which began the trend of mainstream, modern-day cops-and-robbers films, to other very meticulously crafted caper films, the heist genre is one which is both exciting and compelling to crack before the climactic final act. American Hustle is a modern day, somewhat self-indulgent, patriotic heist film with outstanding performances, many good times and very few bad times. The beauty of Hustle lies in its amazing ability to fake it; whether it be faking an overly complicated narrative for no apparent reason or a meaningful story that never gets old, Hustle is a solid film that will con your heart, through and through. American Hustle is a testament to a very powerful, respected and hard-working director. David O. Russell is a director who focuses more on his characters than he does on his story, and it is easily noticed in Hustle. Each and every one of the performances in his newest writing/directing credit is every bit as evolved and appreciated as his last. O. Russell has proved, time and time again, that his ability to get the best performances out of his actors is one of his many featured signatures. From Melissa Leo, Amy Adams, Christian Bale, Bradley Cooper, Jacki Weaver, Robert Di Nero, and Jennifer Lawrence, O. Russell brings a furious velocity to his characters in the form of his actors that have ended in Oscar glory, if not recognition, at the very least.American Hustle is a con film showing the real con-artists as small time players against the biggest con artists of the world; the American government and the American judicial system. Hustle is a loose re-telling of the events following the investigation of the operation named 'Abscam'.Like any good story being told, it begins, and will always begin with a girl. That girl, in this case, is Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), or Lady Edith Greensly, either way, it starts with a girl, as do most American narratives. When low-level con artist and small-time businessman Irving Rosenfeld meets stripper Sydney at a party in 1978, the two begin a love-affair that involves low-level stakes at fraud and scamming, unbeknownst to Irving's unstable wife at the time, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence). As Irving and Sydney meet investors and embezzle their money, they attract the attention of undercover FBI agent Richie Di Maso (Bradley Cooper). Desperate to make a name for himself, Di Maso entraps the two con-artists in a scam that includes the mayor of Camden, New Jersey Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), various members of Congress, and the mafia.While Irving's life spins completely out of control between spiralling cons, a love triangle between him, Sydney, and Richie, as well as his manipulating and out of control wife, Irving must master the fine art of deception so that he and Sydney can still come out with their lives.Much like the marketing of the film, and true to the style of the director, the performances are at the forefront of Hustle. Turning in two of the best performances of his career (the other being the slow burning thriller Out of the Furnace) Bale solidifies his confidence as a serious method actor. Bale's dedication to the craft, whether it be his outrageous weight-gain or loss, heightens his performances.Other stand-out performances include Amy Adams, whose confused and beguiling depiction of a desperate woman in search of love, happiness, and the American dream, is met wholeheartedly when she delivers lines like 'you're nothing to me until you're everything'. Adams sheds her good-girl image as she did for O. Russell previously in The Fighter, by playing the sexy pillar to her love interests. Much like Julia Roberts did in Erin Brockovich, I'm not sure if Adams deserves the supporting Oscar nomination or if her constantly revealing side-boob does. Either way, Adams seduces her leading men in high fashion, and ironically enough, low fabric.Lawrence, who won the Oscar for Lead Actress with O. Russell's highly over-rated Silver Linings Playbook last year as another unstable, slutty persona, really gives a sense of her characters unwillingness to change. Lawrence's Rosalyn is a crazy, contorting character who shows that her character is way out of her league in her husband's world of deceit. Rosalyn is really a child in a grown man's world.Renner hits it out of the park as Polito, an honest man whose sketchy manoeuvres as a person in power, really sheds the action-hero substitute Renner has been playing recently in franchise revival action genre films.Cooper gives a great physical performance as he did also in Playbook, but unfortunately falls short and sidelined by Bale's unwavering performance. Plus, I'm not sure if the tight-curl perm really helped with the believability of his character or if it may have been a tad too distracting to Cooper's overall performance.At the end of the day, as Irving states early in the film, 'we con everyone, we even con ourselves'. American Hustle is a much needed con of a film of heavy hitting dramas in a hopeful Oscar season. Blending an exhilarating mix of serious comedy and satire, O. Russell preaches some of his many valiant directing efforts by trusting in his highly-skilled actors and allowing them to use improvisation to develop the shape of the films rustic narrative. O. Russell's characters literally sing their hearts out to ensure the audience understands the subtle points of their deep emotions, and with the help of a highly effective retro-soundtrack to hit some of the confusing plot points.Read the rest of this review at www.nightfilmreviews.com",8,1,3,2 January 2014
Rush," Review: Rush Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","Loud, proud, and relentless in its portrayal of sport rivals, Ron Howard's Rush is another entry into his formulaic and conventional directing resume. Like any well oiled machine, Howard is an expert of giving audiences a fundamentally linear narrative with striking and beautiful aesthetic choices, even if the narrative follows the rivalry between two Formula One drivers whose careers and competition is anything but straight-cut.Rush isn't the best film of the year by far, and in terms of narrative the film suffers from clichéd plot-points, predictable sport film tropes and by-the-book autobiographical rules, but one of the highlights of Rush is the effortlessness of telling the story of two incredible men's lives, without making one or the other the lead protagonist or antagonist. Rush is the true story of two passionate and talented drivers whose race to becoming the Formula One World Champion is something quite unbelievable.The film begins in the middle of its narrative, at the beginning of the 1976 German Grand Prix in Nürburgring, mere moments before Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) experiences what is suspected to be a rear suspension failure that hospitalized him for a month and a half. We then flashback to 1970 at a Formula Three race in the Crystal Palace circuit in England where the rivalry between Lauda and James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) begins. Destined to be rivals since their initial meeting, the film follows the trails and tribulations of Lauda and Hunt's fight to the Formula One circuit. Lauda, a mechanical genius who uses his skills on cars to earn his spot beside Clay Regazzoni (Pierfrancesco Favino) and the Scuderia Ferrari racing team, shows skill as a engineer but suffers socially, proving to be somewhat inept when it comes to interacting with people. While Hunt, an unapologetic, globetrotting playboy, seems to have no problems interacting with his fans (maybe a little too often). Where Hunt lacks for meticulous calculations and mechanical understanding, things Lauda posses, Hunt makes up for in raw talent, ambition and 'balls'.The film chronicles not only an intense rivalry set in the dangerous world of Formula One Racing, but the film also depicts a rivalry of wits between two men, who suffer and sacrifice so much for respect in a world inhabited by high-adrelanline, death-defying racers.Rush is definitely a return to form for Howard, who, after the problematic and chaotic The Dilemma, had a lot to prove aesthetically and narratively. Aesthetically, Howard had his wheels spinning uncontrollably with inspiration. From the film's 1970′s grainy look, to its very artistic slow-motion racing scenes (which acts as a nice irony to the sport), to the choice of camera angles when covering the pivotal scenes of the race, usually shooting at a very low angle, Howard does use the film to solidify his place as a stylistic filmmaker again, as he did previously with Cinderella Man, Apollo 13 and A Beautiful Mind. Howard surrounded himself with the best this time around, and made no mistakes. With a modest $38 Million budget for a Hollywood film, Howard was able to create an high-octane Formula One film, grounded as a character piece. Written by Peter Morgan (The Queen), shot by Anthony Dod Mantle (Slumdog Millionaire), Scored by Hans Zimmer (The Dark Knight trilogy), and produced by film-extraordinaire and longtime collaborator Brian Grazer, Rush is assembled just like any other team in the Formula One cockpit, meticulously and strategically.It also did not hurt that Howard was able to get Hemsworth out of Nordic armour and deliver his finest performance to date. The real star of the film is Brühl. Underrated and overlooked since his career-defining role in Tarantino's Inglorious Bastards, Brühl inhabits his rat-like character and shows the intolerable side of a man obsessed with perfection, discontent with happiness, and who shows no emotional response to the fast pace world which exists around him. Brühl's transformation into Lauda is one that will hopefully be acknowledged come award season.Rush is a good film. More of a solid entry into the autobiographical sport genre, much like 42 earlier this year, the film lacks an intensity most great sport films have, which is the intensity of the sport itself. Some of the greatest sport movies ever made use the sport to elevate character progression, intense emotion or moments that audiences cheer for. There was never a rousing moment of triumph, pleasure or extreme emotion with our characters that took place on the racetrack. Unfortunately for the film, some of the best scenes happen on the streets of Italy, in the hospital, or in restaurants and furnace rooms where the characters grow and evolve; the racetrack is just a forum for winning.Unfortunately for the audience, between near-fatal crashes, personal lows and tragic endings, Rush never emotionally resonates with us. Lacking for a connection with Hunt and Lauda, Howard doesn't give the audience much time to connect with his drivers the way they do with their vehicles. 'Men love women, even more than that, men love cars!'. I don't think there could have been a more accurate way to describe the film and the world where testosterone, ego, and fuel, pumps the veins in the hearts of each racer.Night Film Reviews: 7/10 Stars",7,2,5,11 November 2013
Dallas Buyers Club," Review: Dallas Buyers Club
","Since before the start of the new millennium until just after 2010,  Matthew McConaughey's body of work was just that, a body that worked  well on the screen for so many of the aimless, brainless onslaught of  romantic/comedy disasters, in which he played the lead. In 1996,  McConaughey played Jake Tyler Brigance in Joel Schumacher's A Time To  Kill. Hailed as the best performance of his career, it seemed like,  critically, that was the closest the actor would get to any praise.  In 2011, McConaughey took the lead in Brad Furman's The Lincoln Lawyer,  a by-the-number crime/mystery, where, McConaughey was able to flex some  of his acting muscles as opposed to abdomen muscles. Since then, in  what has been the most sudden and misunderstood acting turn in recent  memory, McConaughey has reinvented his career and is continuing to be  casted as a serious actor with serious acting skills.  While the Texan acting inspiration has remolded his career in a time  span that puts to shame that of Downey Jr. and Travolta, one of  McConaughey's unflinching signature acting staples is his bold and  proud Texan accent. And while I can't really imagine how a cowboy like  himself was cast in Christopher Nolan's upcoming science fiction  Interstellar, McConaughey and his accent were surely a match made in  heaven for his role as the slowly weathering and dying HIV/AIDS patient  Ron Woodruff.  For Dallas Buyers Club, McConaughey and his accent worked exceptionally  well. Quebecois director Jean-Marc Vallee helms McConaughey as Ron  Woodruff; a rugged, homophobic, ultra- macho, bull-riding, money  throwing, playboy with no accord to anyone. Woodruff, a money hustling,  chance taking electrician juggles his fortune, his luck, his women, and  his job to make ends meet and live a somewhat fulfilling life. It isn't  until an unexpected accident at work that leaves Woodruff hospitalized,  giving him no choice but to make a difference in his life and the lives  of many others.  Upon learning of his recent HIV positive diagnostics and short thirty  day life expectancy time span, Woodruff, reluctant to die, uses his  hustling, smooth-talking, greasing ways to secure him a new, untested  medicine to prolong the spread of HIV, the FDA (Food and Drug  Administration) approved AZT. After consuming an uncontrolled amount of  AZT, the only legal drug that was available at the time in the United  States, all the while, still abusing his substances, Woodruff has a  close encounter with death. Coming to the morbid realization that the  ATZ was depleting his longevity, he enlists the help of a disgraced  doctor (Griffin Dunne) and together bring unapproved anti-viral  treatments to the U.S illegally. What starts off as a simple economic  money tapping market venture, Woodruff, along the way, comes to the  realization that his efforts to help others, are actually working.  Enlisting the help of fellow HID/AIDS victim Rayon (Jared Leto), the  two start the Dallas Buyers Club, an alternative treatment centre for  paying members that pits Woodruff in a gestating face-to-face with the  FDA and other pharmaceutical companies. As the clientele grows thanks  to Rayon's introduction to the biggest HIV/AIDS demographic,  homosexuals, Woodruff has a revelation that not only changes his  opinion of gays but also is a deep and dark look of sexual  discrimination in the south of the U.S in the 1980′s.  Dallas Buyers Club is a film dependent on the skills of its actors  physical and mental performances. Aside from McConaughey's drastic  forty pound weight loss, supporting actor Jared Leto dropped a hefty  amount of weight to play the utterly convincing transsexual Rayon.  Veering far away from Christian Bale comparisons in his eerie and  grotesque turn as Trevor Reznik in Brad Anderson 2004′s indie The  Machinist, the two leads in the Dallas Buyers Club abandon physical  spectacle in exchange for allowing their on-screen presence to give a  candid, historical accuracy of HIV/AIDS patients, and the brutal  struggle they faced against a deadly and unforgiving epidemic in the  United States in the 1980′s.  Dallas Buyers Club is McConaughey's best role yet. Fierce, trashy and  edifying, the actor substitutes humility for profanity, glamour for  wretchedness, and the light-hearted for the heavy and unapologetic.  Finally, McConaughey joins a club of actors that he should be proud to  be a part of.  Although the year's lead actor category is going to be a full one at  this year's Academy Awards, the Supporting Actor category will have a  clear winner. Unrecognizable, subtle and submerged into the role, their  is no deny or ignoring the raw talent Leto brings to the role of Rayon.  His previous efforts as a dedicated method actor, either gaining a  large amount of weight or shedding weight with a wink of an eye, Leto's  dedication to the craft is showcased in Dallas Buyers Club, and will  surely be rewarded.  Dallas Buyers Club is a morally, heavy-hitting drama with lasting  effects. Dramatizing the social discrimination of gays in the South of  the United States and the condition of many low-income, trailer-park  living American residents, the film raises the questions whether or not  AIDS/HIVS and other fatal diseases are fairly treated within government  fine print and whether the main goal of such large and powerful  companies is wealth, or health.  Gritty, raw and compelling, Dallas Buyers Club is a powerfully dramatic  based on a true story. Woodruff was a simple man, whose unfortunate  condition brought forth an incredible man who's zest for life inspires  others. Ron Woodruff definitely rode the bull in life; challenging the  powerful FDA, pharmaceutical companies and notions that were instilled  in his since birth. Thankfully for us, Vallee, McConaughey and Leto  ride the film into a place in our hearts, in an overly sexualized,  passionate display of what it's like to die 'with your boots on';  dirty, gritty and with a fighting chance.",8,133,167,11 November 2013
The Fault in Our Stars," Film Reviews: The Fault In Our Stars/www.nightfilmreviews.com
","I have never been surrounded by so many teenage girls before until I sat down to watch this film. During an early screening of the alluring teenage film adaptation of John Green's novel The Fault In Our Stars, I was surely the minority of the sexes. To be honest, I don't think I knew exactly how outnumbered I was until the film's tragic scenes unfolded, delivering a current of waterworks and overwhelmingly loud wails of screaming, crying and sniffling, predominantly from female audience members. This early screening of the film was jam-packed, and had me sitting only a row away from the massive screen. If Josh Boone's film adaptation of The Fault In Our Stars taught me anything, it's to never underestimate the power of teenage girls and their ability to pack theaters and show their support for films and books they love.The Fault In Our Stars is guilty of possessing a number of faults, but its biggest sin lies in its persistence to aspire to be greater than it actually is. It succeeds when it exposes us to the tragic relationship between its protagonists and the loved ones around them, and fails when it aspires to find new territory of plot and redemption for characters that are already born with unlimited amounts of pathos.Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley) is as much a teenage girl as any other living in the United States. Her love of reality television, reading and curiosity of the taboo is just as strong as other girls within America. The only difference: Hazel Grace has terminal cancer. The Fault In Our Stars should be a film about cancer and how it effects the people surrounded by it (think 50/50), but it becomes overwhelming with its fascination to overly glamorize the telling of a tainted love story, therefore becoming a love story about people with cancer (think A Walk To Remember).From the beginning, love, life and happiness are overshadowed by impending doom, and that is perhaps the problem with the film. No matter how much you fall in love with Hazel Grace or Augustus Waters (Ansel Elgort), their fates are sealed. Green's novel may have been about telling a heart-breaking love story between young teens, but much like Hazel's fascination with her favourite book and the open endedness of a certain literary character, Hazel's happiness is less about coming to terms with death, and more about the continuation of the life of her loved ones. The interactions with the people who will survive and live well beyond Hazel's existence are never given their due diligence on-screen, especially her mother (played delicately by Laura Dern), always being pushed aside by the love story that will ultimately end in unhappiness and tears.There is sure to be a reason why Green's novel has becomes such a pop culture sensation. The film is said to be a somewhat loyal adaptation, brimming with very clever metaphors of life and death through dialogue and foreshadowing. It does a masterful job of fetishizing the most average looking parks, backyards and parking lots, and makes great use of its supporting actors. Sadly, the two actors that have the most screen time are the two weakest components of the film. Woodley, who is slowly following in the footsteps of Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence, seems to play Hazel Grace less, and herself more. With the exception of her chopping off her hair and having an oxygen tank follow her around everywhere she goes, Woodley only taps the surface of her character Hazel Grace, barely gracing audiences with the brilliance radiating with the promise of such a philosophically pessimistic character.Elgort, who comes off as a character who is easy to fall in love with, shows much of his charm and promise as a young actor. Elgort as Waters shimmers with potential, delivering a performance of a person who may be a little too cherry and perfect, given sad circumstances.Green had said to gain the inspiration of the novel by working as a student chaplain at a children's hospital. Drawn to the exuberant life of its terminally ill patients, Green is quoted as saying he wanted to write a book about people who were constantly being dehumanized, while showcasing the abundance of humanity in people with a terminal illness. The film does an excellent job of making audiences believe that love is what keeps Hazel and Augustus alive. Love becomes the answer, but only for so long before the inevitability of death at the end of a terminal illness takes hold. There is a point where love exists, and people fade in the film, and although the relationships that held strong are bonded by love, hope of an improbably oblivion becomes the films main concern.The Fault In Our Stars can be self-assured as being a quality film made for an audience that would be content with half-assed filmmaking. The production quality and storytelling is top- notch, even if its is constantly emotionally manipulating. The soundtrack is filled with hyper 'emo' songs, the look and feel of the film is drenched with sadness and all hope is lost with each new, depressing plot twist and turn. Thankfully, its supporting cast of actors supports the majority of the film's life. From Lotte Verbeek, a literary assistant who makes the best out of sad situations and breathes new life to new experiences for the couple, to a saddened and miserable author played wonderfully by Willem Dafoe, to the underused best friend to the couple Isaac (played brilliantly by Nat Wolff), the small, brief appearances by the people in Augustus and Hazel's life are never given enough screen time to show shattering conclusions when sadness strikes.",6,6,15,6 June 2014
Non-Stop," Review: Non-Stop/ www.nightfilmreviews.com
","In 2009, actor Liam Neeson starred in Pierre Morel's surprise sleeper hit Taken, and what begun was an onslaught of early year/before spring Neeson action releases that solidified the star as playing aging, 'could-be real life' superheroes. Since then, there are only two things certain about early action film releases; there will always be one featuring kick-ass icon Jason Statham playing the younger, balder super human hero, and one featuring Neeson, usually playing a wrinkled, more seasoned action star who could very well be your father (or grandfather)–which was badass three films ago. Deep down I am secretly waiting for Hollywood to come to their senses and announce a showdown between the two action superstars. Now talk about a kick-ass early year action release that we kinda saw coming. With something as expected as a Neeson release, also comes the expectation for a clichéd, unoriginal, and purely entertaining action story line. Unexpectedly collaborating again with his Unknown director Jaume Collet-Serra, Neeson buckles up for an actioner set in the sky. Unlike the highly entertaining nineties guilty pleasure Air Force One, Non-Stop seems to steer more in the direction of the wholly disastrous Flightplan. After all is said and done, the film becomes a constant re-hashing of previous wind-cutting skyline action films without much original altitude.Neeson plays Bill Marks, an ex-NYPD officer whose life has been riddled by alcohol and pity for his inability to deliver as a father and husband. Taking cues from 2012 Flight, the comparison between Washington's intoxicated and wholly unorthodox airline pilot Whip Whitaker and Neeson's drunken Air Marshal Marks is almost impossible to ignore–but with less satisfying results. As Marks boards his next plane, arguing with his superiors on the phone, he is on the look out for suspecting terrorists. Like most flights today, everyone who boards seem to be the same blend of miserable, occupied, exhausted and professional. As the flight takes off and Marks grips his armrest, he befriends his by chance, first-class neighbour Jen Summers (Julianne Moore). As they get to know one another, Marks receives an anonymous message via a secure network on his mobile device threatening to kill a passenger on the flight every twenty minutes. As the plane makes its way over the Atlantic, hours from the closest airport, Marks must figure out who is attempting to sabotage the plane and it's passengers, as well as frame him for a terrorist attack on the very plane he was hired to Marshal.Screenwriters John W. Richardson, Christopher Roach and Ryan Engle had the potential to do so much with a script surrounding an Air Marshal in a post-9/11 world, yet the three seemed to diddle-daddle in familiar, mystery/thriller action territory. The characters are just about as interesting as the reasoning behind the terrorist attack. Neeson brings nothing new or special to the role, leaving all that talent behind on the runway. Obvious jabs are directed towards the only clear terrorist stereotype of the film, Dr. Fahim Nasir, played with poise by Omar Metwally, the only Afghan on the flight. Throughout the film, the other passengers questions Marks' quick and uninterested attitude towards Dr. Nasir, usually resulting in a face with raised eyebrows and a 'that's it?', even from fellow officer on-board Austin Reilly (Corey Stoll). Non-Stop shows the ignorance and fear that people still carry with them while travelling as so many are still quick to assume terror with Muslims or Middle-Easterners. It was moments like these that make one question the integrity and intelligence of the writers; either they intentionally sought to bring to light this point, or they just felt the need to capitalize on an assumption they figured everyone would make. If you ask me, this alone would make for a much more interesting take on the affects of people on a non-stop flight than what was delivered instead. The film is a truly safe, by-the numbers 'whodunit' with traces of unoriginal directing and half- assed acting. Marks watches his plane fill up with people with hazy eyes and blurry vision, insinuating his drunken state of mind. It's too bad the film serves nothing interesting once your strapped in and settled.By the time the big twist comes and the baddies are revealed, there are only a few questions that are left running around non-stop; is there anything Moore can't be good at? How was Collet- Serra able to round out a cast that includes Scoot McNairy, Nate Parker and Lupita Nyong'o? And why the hell is Neeson so inclined to collaborate with his formulaic and unoriginal director a third time in the upcoming Run All Night feature that is set on February 6th 2015, where, as expected, much of the same uncreative action antics will surely take place?Non-Stop may deliver cheap thrills, ludicrous revelations, and half-hearted scenes of redemption with much entertainment, but contrary to its title, things seem to move at a much slower rate than suggested. By the time the credits role, one of the questions I was continually asking myself was, why the heck wasn't I drinking during this turbulent, bumpy ride of a film?",5,2,10,1 March 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Review: The Grand Budapest Hotel/ www.nightfilmreviews.com
","'You see, there are still faint glimmers of civilization left in this barbaric slaughter house that was once known as humanity'. If there was ever a quote to sum up the films of Wes Anderson, this would be high on the list. Highly inventive, absurd, and at times, narratively incoherent, Anderson's eighth feature film is a grand, accommodating feature whose self is probably not as grand as the cast it has rounded out.From Ralph Fiennes, Harvey Kietel, Bob Balaban, Saoirse Ronan, Lea Seydoux, to regulars Tilda Swinton, Adrien Brody, Jason Schwartzman and of course Bill Muarry, The Grand Budapest Hotel is a formidably full house of A-list actors who happily lend their skills to the highly inventive and immensely visual Anderson. Aside from the wholly impressive cast, is the quirky and unmistakably unique vision of Anderson himself.If you haven't been fortunate enough to experience a Wes Anderson film yet, you are surely missing out on one of the most elaborate, detailed, and symmetrical styles of film-making ever known. Anderson's style, renown and admired by many, may very well be the American indie art-house King and The Grand Budapest Hotel may very well be his grandest and most admirable spectacle yetâ€“although it may not be his most engaging or beloved.The Grand Budapest Hotel is an empirical picture, in every sense of the word. Throughout his career as a writer/director, Anderson has defined and refined his vision to the point that every heist; every adventure; or every group of individuals, can easily be distinguishable, as if their existence could only be understood within an Anderson film. The essence of the characters within The Grand Budapest, as well as his overall vision, is creatively maintained thanks to the purity of the scenarios and wackiness of the characters Anderson houses, in whatever setting it may be. For decades now, Anderson has bequeathed to film-lovers everywhere and audiences' alike, a signature style unlike any other.There are countless films where the characters have come secondary only to the immense and elaborate setting they are placed in. For example, in many films urban settings; New York City has played a pivotal role (see: Shame and Annie Hall), The Wild West (see: The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada, Unforgiven), and exotic locales within Europe set the landscape for timeless stories of intrigue, lust, love and tragedy (see: Vicky Cristina Barcelona and The Bicycle Thief.). In Anderson's world, although many of his settings are within the very real world we live in today, sublets of his world are envisioned within our world, and in essence, these locales become the greatest character of them all, housing very small, intricate tales of the people whose stories are shared in its presence. The setting this time, is none other than the Grand Budapest. A hotel, that houses the highly empathetic new lobby boy Zero (Tony Revolori) and his journey to becoming the irreplaceable sidekick to the one and only infamous concierge M. Gustave H (Ralph Fiennes). Among the many other patrons of the hotel and each of their individual secrets, tall tales, and life memories, Anderson centres the film around a priceless painting, now put in the hands of Gustave thanks to death of M. Gustave's latest deceased romance, the mysteriously elder Madame D (an unrecognizable Tilda Swinton). What transpires, is an array of fantastical plot schemes and recanted storytelling that may only make sense when mentioning the name of Wes Anderson.Like any other Anderson film, the stories are only secondary to their execution. Anderson's films are the closet things to mathematical proofs, where the process of plot-making comes first before the final, usually predictable and happy outcome. Anderson may have come off one of his most cherished screenplays with his last film Moonrise Kingdom, and The Grand Budapest Hotel may in no way trump it, but thankfully, it never tries. Instead, after exploring the unfathomable bond between young lovers, Anderson penetrates deep and long the affections of friendship and the importance of patronage within the industry of service and hospitality. Surprisingly this is a theme that he has yet to encounter, especially after his beloved muse and frequent collaborator Kumar Pallana passed and served as nothing less than a staple to the Anderson cannon. Think of The Grand Budapest Hotel as a large and completely dysfunctional family taking care of you, much like Anderson's earlier work The Royal Tenenbaums, only this time, imagine them slotted at the other end of a hotel reception desk.In recent superhero films, including the abysmal Spider-Man 3, some of studios biggest let- downs are due to saturation of talent. Many directors, usually overwhelmed with fitting in actors, story lines, and significant narrative points, are unable to tend to the large range of highly versatile skills many character actors possess. But, as seen with his raw and disturbing state of family life, Anderson has a natural knack for understanding and using large casts to his advantage. Never taking up more screen time than needed, each face, each actor and each role is given its due diligence and serves a purpose, always elevating the unbelievability of his stories. His characters are merely caricatures of the people Anderson imagines, and it can only be seen that we, as an audience, are allowed a faint glimmer inside this imagination.The Grand Budapest Hotel truly lives up to the Anderson name. As incredibly talented and always enigmatic, the work of this visual artist/filmmaker, will continue to be studied, analyzed and understood, well beyond his death. Anderson is mostly concerned with the indulgence of life. Thankfully, using his neon bright cast to highlight a dull and ubiquitous story of hidden secrets and falsification, new light is shed on a world and a man whose purity and pleasure in movie making art, is like the enjoyment of a fine French pastry.",6,4,12,23 March 2014
The Favourite," Film Review: The Favourite/www.nightfilmreviews.com
","'Favour is a breeze that shifts direction all the time.'Lathimos' third English language film following The Lobster and The Killing of a Sacred Dear is an exploration of the absurdities of the rich, powerful and bored.Yet no matter how many clever indications one my make about the film's title or the various tongue-in-cheek references that could be used to describe the film, or even Lathimos' canon as a whole, it comes as a surprise to many that the director's most tamed and least ghastly and disturbing film to date, is by far his most ravishing yet.While the specific genre of the film has yet to be determined, Lathimos' The Favourite is a hodgepodge of cinematic tropes; part black comedy, part period piece, part love story, part cat-and-mouse thriller, part buddy comedy, part completely insane, the film deconstructs everything that you expect from all of these categories of film and throws them completely on their head with immense style, fashion and perfection. To say The Favourite will be like anything you've ever seen, is a direct and misleading understatement, much like the characters it presents.Written by Deborah Davis and Tony McNamara, The Favourite marks the first film Lathimos has not written a script he has directed since making his big splash at Cannes in 2009 with his highly unconventional and controversial film Dogtooth. Yet, as much as we appreciate the auteur's uncanny ability of making people feel uncomfortable using the eeriness and awkwardness of other people by simply interacting with one another, this is one script that feels more Lathimos than any of the ones he has written in the past.While the film is made during a prominent and very loud #MeToo movement in Hollywood, The Favourite is set in 18th Century England, a land where Queens rule and Kings drool, especially when the Queen is Mrs. Morley Anne (Olivia Colman) ruler of Scotland, Ireland and England and currently waging war against France. While the Queen is surrounded by men, including her military commanders and parliamentary leaders, Queen Anne proves that at the end of the day, the women make the rules and own the house. Yet, as important and iconic Queen Anne is, it becomes clear quickly that Anne is no more of a mere mortal with a crown next to her life-long friend and council advisor, The Duchess of Marlborough, Sarah Churchill (Rachael Weisz). While Sarah is able to wholly intimidate, scoff and insult the Queen right to her face, it seem that Sarah is only looking out for one person and one person only, despite her illusions and deceit. Occasionally giving accord to Queen Anne or her husband for that matter, military commander of the Queen's army, Lord Marlborough (Mark Gatniss), Sarah is one a one-way ticket to riches, power and most importantly her, affection.As Sarah seems to seemingly pave a path of success for years to come, things come to a steady halt with the arrival of her cousin, Abigail (Emma Stone). Although Abagail arrives in a heap of mud, discontent and stalked by tragedy, she quickly hardens up and wilts to the whim of her commanding cousin, only to quickly gain her affection and take her opportunity for the Queen's admiration, following a natural herbal remedy for the Queen's disgusting gout infested legs. Once Abigail becomes the Queen's own personal leg-rubber, she begins plotting her dominance over the Queen and her affections, overshadowing her own cousin, proving that Sarah's protegé as quickly become her biggest and most intimidating rival.Where Sarah adorns the Queen with her brazen honesty and harsh truths, including advising when the queen looks like a badger, Abigail's approach to the affections of the Queen include lies, deceit and endless compliments, making the Queen feel unlike anything Sarah never has. Often times eroticizing the Queen and her mundane and bizarre daily routines with her bunnies and while eating, Abigail and Sarah begin to duel for Anne's love, doing whatever it takes to be her favourite.As it turns out, each woman is capable of much unpleasantness, not only to one another, themselves but also to the poor saps surrounding them. Manipulating every man, woman and child around them for their own personal gains; both in search of security, status and nobility, Abigail and Sarah turn the conventions of a chessboard on its head, and make the queens, rooks, bishops and knights all of their pawns in their sick and twisted little kinky game of pleasure.Attacking one another like vipers and wolves, jealousy becomes the weapon of choice for both women, who's use of men only intensifies their sadistic little game of mitral destruction and decay. Taking no prisoners, Abigail and Sarah create alliances, forms admirable teams with many of the men occupying the palace on a daily basis. Abigail learns quickly that her most valuable alliance is the head of parliamentary opposition Harley (Nicholas Hoult), despite his every opportunity to throw Abigail to the gutter. Although many of the men in The Favourite seem to hold their own against the two duelling cousins, it becomes clear with every ridiculous pastime that the men engage in, that the women, no matter how fragile or understated they are, truly hold the men in the palm of their hands. Where we see the men engaging in ludicrous activities of whipping food at each other while naked, duck races and ridiculous forms of dance, women are the only ones seen holding the guns, aiming and killing their prey and having their faces splattered with blood. The men in The Favourite are covered in make-up, wigs and fancy dress, while the women are stripped of their beauty and shown with the scars, bloody noses and battle wounds. Lathimos makes the gun range backyard the common area for Abigail and Sarah's verbal competitions, while the rest of the days, they leave their most valiant and best efforts on the line by exhausting the very people they claim to love.While the war against the French is always a constant plot within the castle, Lathimos and his talent crew uses the palace as a stomping ground for much haste and ugliness, never showcases physical battle rather the coyness and sneaky actions of each woman's slithering jabs. The trickery of each woman's constant blows are embellished in absolute pleasure thanks to the captivating fish-eye lens tracking shots of Robbie Ryan's camera. Shooting tracking shots from an ant's eye view, upside down, tilting and swinging the camera in every which way and direction, Ryan gives a sense of banishment and fleeting optics to a completely farce security in a castle where allegiance switch at the drop of a pin.The Favourite may very well be a perfect film and one of the most unexpected pleasures of 2018, but none of that would ring true if it wasn't for the performances of our three female leads. Constantly engaging in the moral destruction of one another's characteristics and pushing the limits physically, mentally and most of all, emotionally, our three leading ladies are at the top of their acting games, proving that the Academy may be in favour of royalty. Weisz is as cunning, sharp and ruthless as can be as a woman who utilizes history as a weapon towards establishing a future. Looking as sly as ever, Weisz is bound to be recognized for her performance that transform her soft eyes into sharp diamonds with razor-sharp edges. Stone, although she isn't singing or dancing, gives the best performance of her career, stripping down her clothing and girl-next door image for a woman capable of anything; including beating herself with a book and bloodying the battlefield of war. Stone's highly misunderstood pouted lips conceal her snake-like tongue and vicious bite. Yet, both women pale in comparison to Colman, an actress who has probably appeared in something you've watched before, but completely and unapologetically demands attention with Queen Anne's constant eccentricities. Whether dunked in mud, on the floor, covered in absurd make-up or having food hang from the very ends of her mouth, Colman gives a favourable performances that will no doubt take attention during the Awards Season and give new meaning the bondages of portraying a matriarchal Queen. Colman is nothing short of godly.Self-interest and selfishness is the goal and while casualties are expected, Yorgos Lathimos delivers one of the best movies of 2018. The Favourite favours bold acting, incomparable shooting styles, a magnificent score and one of the most unexpected and gruellingly enjoyable movie experiences of the year, and it asks for no apologies. One may be hard pressed to find something else within the year and may side with The Favourite, because Lathimos proves once again that the deconstruction of human values, is much more fun than building it up. Even though parents always avoid picking their favourites, when it comes to 2018, it'll be hard to choose a monstrous extravagance as good as this one.",10,14,33,26 December 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Film Review: Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood/www.nightfilmreviews.com
","Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is one thing and one thing only; Quentin Tarantino's beautifully crafted dreamy love letter to cinema!With his newest feature, the current master of cinema's vision reminds us why movies are cool again. For the first time, in a long time, there's a film that begs to be seen, not in the comfort of your own home, not on your Netflix cue on an airplane, but in front of a silver screen, with an audience and you're right...some popcorn. Once Upon A Time is less a film and more an experience; one where the bustling hot summer days are corrected by the high intensity air conditioning of the multiplexes; one where the theatres are a safe haven for summer love and first kisses, an experience where going to the movies is as magical as popping your cherry. That's what a Tarantino film is like; just like when I first went to go see his Grindhouse experience for the first time, Tarantino is a visionary old soul, hell bent on sharing his memorable cinematic experiences of his past, with us today.If you are a cinephile and don't know about Quentin Tarantino's work, most, if not all people will tell you that you should just quit now, but I digress. Tarantino worked at a blockbuster in Hollywood, California in his early years, consuming as much cinema as possible. One of his most revered quotes to date about film is his famous line that 'When people asked me if I went to film school I tell them no. I went to films'. Funny enough, this quote captures the essence of Tarantino and his canon; an individual who entered the world of cinema out of the sheer love of watching films, just like myself.As an artist myself and lover of film, I never went to film school also. Hopefully, as someone who would eventually love to make their own films one day, I feel that this is one of the many reasons why I admire, as well as, so heavily identify with Tarantino. I also learned about films by watching them. Just like myself, the influence in Tarantino films is wide ranging. His largest inspirations draws from the New Wave Gangster pictures of France, crafted by the likes of Jean Pierre Melville, Francois Truffaut and Jean-Luc Godard. All of the names listed are absolute giants in celluloid and contributed in my opinion the most to modern cinema that features, as Godard would say, 'A girl and a gun'. According to Godard, that is pretty much all that is necessary to making a good motion picture. Other notable Influences on Tarantino would be essentially any film from the 1970's because that is the era when he began to understand and study cinema, an era of films by Don Siegel, Sergio Leone and George Roy Hill.Yet while many are quick to label QT as a scam artist and artistic thief, I feel like it is my duty to rectify that notion. Before continuing on, it has to be said that art copies art, inspiration inspires and according to Mark Twain, there is no such thing as originality, only levels of authenticity. Therefore, it is my extreme pleasure to introduce and name QT a master of authenticity for his cinema. Just like when Sergio Leone remade a Kurosawa picture and developed it into the Dollars trilogy, or when Christopher Nolan gave his interpretation of the Dark Knight recently, or when Martin Scorsese won his first Oscar for remaking a Japanese film and later naming it The Departed, art is not our subject, WE are its subject. Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is the iconic director's masterful indulgence in everything that he loves about movies and everything we should love, too!Aside from Taratino, Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood isn't just one man's magnum opus, but a collection of so many talented artists, starting with its cast. The film opens with Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt going for a cruise to a watering hole. Dicaprio stars as Rick Dalton, a good ole' boy from Missouri who drinks for hydration and smokes for oxygen. Once the leading man in television and film, appearing in western serials, one aptly titled Bounty Law, Dalton is on the tail end of his acting career. The Midwestern-American cowboy style Dalton knew all too well, is being suffocated and changed, no thanks to the foreign influenced, free-loving hippie movement. While DiCaprio's Dalton emits a certain swagger that charms many, the audience comes to realize that this 'swagger' is less a personality trait and more a clearly stubborn, unchangeable style and resilience to the conforming of the times around him. According to Rick, Rick Dalton is still big; it's the pictures that just got small. While it may be hard to argue this notion, DiCaprio's riotous as the comedic force of the film. Blending well with Tarantino's signature writing style for a second time, DiCaprio's Dalton stutters, stammers and then collectively pulls himself together in front of a camera. DiCaprio shows vulnerability constantly through induced breakdowns which is such a breath of fresh air from the usual leading roles we have seen DiCaprio play, yet also portrays the perfectly balanced and well-to-do movie star, we have come to expect from the actor, and all his character thus far.Yet, as good as DiCaprio is, the clear cut favourite of Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is easily the most underrated actor work today...and that's Brad Pitt. Pitt plays Cliff Booth, Dalton's best friend, stunt double and, essentially, life coach. Keeping Rick on an even keel on the daily, Cliff also serves as Rick's driver thanks to many of Rick's drunken nights that end at the end of a street lamp. Booth opposite to Dalton emits something Dalton never could, and that's an unaccepting Hollywood confidence. You know that confidence where 'you're a movie star but don't want to be a movie star, but no matter what you do to deny it, you're still a movie star' type swag? The type of swag where you kick the heck out of Bruce Lee and live to tell the tale? Yea, that's Cliff Booth. Booth's swagger is a type of cool that cannot be tampered with or broken; essentially playing the type of friend that any person and everybody would want to have. Yet, the contrasts between the two can't be any more cinematically indulgent. In one of the best and most gratifying scenes in the film, is seeing the contrast of living between the two pals. Dalton, who lives in the Hollywood Hills, in a beautiful mansion, with a pool and famous neighbours in a well to do neighbourhood is pitted against Booth's lifestyle, a lifestyle that involves living inside of a Drive-in trailer, having an adorable yet deadly dog, and wearing a Hawaiian shirt as if its the most iconic costume design of 2019.While Booth and Dalton are both a duo one may soon not forget, Tarantino was quick to point out that Pitt and DiCaprio were going to be a duo similar to the likes of Robert Redford and Paul Newman, who were ironically dominating cinema around the time that Hollywood takes place. Thanks to the release of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in the late 60's and The Sting released in the early 70's, it was no doubt that the two were a match made in heaven. Yet, while this was a self-proclaimed statement made by Tarantino himself, perhaps just as a form of publicity for the film, or just pure Tarantino bravado behaviour, its hard to disagree with his statement at all. Pitt and DiCaprio are a cinematic dream team!Yet, despite all its male glory, the true hero of Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood is Sharon Tate played elegantly by Margot Robbie.While many casual moviegoers may go into Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood without knowing much about the history of Hollywood, Sharon Tate or the Manson family murders, they may come out quite upset, disappointed or underwhelmed with the film. Aside from the fact that first half of the film is basically an elaborate introduction to all the characters, Tarantino takes his time with the process obviously dragging it out for the sheer pleasure of it, a la Once Upon a Time in the West by the masterful Sergio Leone. Yet, his story is glued and always will be linked to Sharon Tate, the late actress who faced an unfortunate, real world fate early on in her life. Yet, despite all this tragedy and grief, Tarantino's Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood may easily be recognized as a love letter to cinema, but deep down, the film is a love letter to a lost star who never really was given her opportunity to share her true potential, and left the world much too early. The Valley of the Dolls actress was a clear inspiration to the auteur, and it is no doubt that, this one was clearly for her.Once Upon A Time...In Hollywood continues the trend of exercising the idea that, this is Tarantino's world, and we are all just living in it. Constant pushing the boundaries of the medium, and rigorously pushing the limits of reality, truth with fact or fiction, grit and pulp, Tarantino creates his own elaborate world with whomever he chooses, however he fashions it to be. Luckily for us audience members, we are able to take a glimpse of some amazing performances, even if it is for mere second, of actors we love and appreciate regularly. Like any good Tarantino film, the likes of new faces and familiar ones flood the screen, including Al Pacino, playing Marvin Schwarzs, a movie producer who sees Rick as a diamond in the industry who simply needs a good polish and update with the times. Marvin proposes that Rick goes to Italy to film a spaghetti western, paralleling the real life history of Hollywood at the time with Clint Eastwood shooting the Dollars films in Rome with Sergio Leone that catapulted Eastwood to stardom.",9,3,6,16 September 2019
Gone Girl," Film Review: Gone Girl/ www.nightfilmreviews.com
","'Everyone told us and told us, marriage is hard work'. Gone Girl is the one film that will embed itself permanently in your psyche. A bold statement, to say the least, but it is the only statement that comes close to describing the frightening physiological paradigm created by suspense maestro Divid Fincher. Emotionally charged, disturbed and at times simply terrifying, Fincher's analysis of what can go wrong with contemporary marriage is the ultimate battle of the sexes and search for answers; whether right, wrong, or completely unexpected.An adaption of the widely sought-after 2012 novel by Gillian Flynn, Gone Girl paints a bloody portrait of battle between husband and wife Nick and Amy Dunne (Ben Affleck and Rosamund Pike) that asks the question asked by many who've had a relationship fall apart before their eyes: how much do you really know about your partner?Contrary to its appearance courtesy of the narratively manipulating and heavily contrived editing and fragmented storytelling, the real issues in Nick and Amy's marriage begin long before either of them even meet. Amy, who is introduced as the atypical yet very real trust-fund baby, lives most of her life steps behind her fictional alter-ego 'Amazing Amy', a character in a children's series authored by her parents, Rand and Marybeth Elliot (David Clennon and Lisa Banes). Nick (Affleck) may very well portray himself as the perfect man. A writer for a men's magazine, Nick finds himself at a yuppie party in the lower-east side of Manhattan before bumping into Amy, where he charms his way into her heart by confessing how he thought quinoa was a type of fish. The two depart the party where Nick leads Amy behind a bakery, the air glistening with sugar flakes, until the moment he kisses the specs of refined white power off her lips, the two perfect lovers fall in love.But like everything that seems too good too be true, their magic doesn't last. Both suffering in their relationship from the failed American economy and Nick's ailing mother, Nick must pick- up his picturesque wife and life in urban New York City, and relocate to his Mid-Western hometown of North Carthage, Missouri. With the passing of Nick's mother and his father's admittance to the local nursing home for treatment of his Alzheimer's, the couple is burdened with financial woes, prompting Nick and his quick-mouthed twin sister Margo (the fantastic Carrie Coon) to open a bar, perfectly named 'The Bar'. Coming home to Amy for their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick drives into his perfect 'McMansion' home and ideal wife, only to find the cat on the driveway, a wide opened front door, and Amy no-where in sight.While many will spoil so much of what the film has to offer, it is best you go into it with a completely untainted opinion regardless if you've read the novel or not. Fincher and Flynn offer a completely revitalized reincarnation of Flynn's novel with many layers, twists and turns, and most of all questions.Fincher has given himself quite the reputation as a noble successor to Hitchcock, mastering the art of Hitchcockian thrillers and suspense. From Fight Club, to his highly stylized American interpretation of The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, Fincher has become the most consistent American director working today. Staying true to his ominous and truly septic vision, faithfully collaborating with editor Kirk Baxter, cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth and music with Oscar winners Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor, Fincher is a meticulously relevant cinematic auteur who knows how to deliver in a tonal, visual, and deep subliminal forum that has quickly become his signature. Trying to ignore big set pieces, he goes to the most basic scenes in all films: two people seated in a room having a conversation. Fincher's greatest cinematic tool is his focus on information, buried in the revelations between characters and their conflicts expressed in their dialogue. Exposition is his greatest asset, with drama driven by audience reaction to a character's divulgence of new information—and Gone Girl is a testament to this.While Gone Girl becomes the most sadistic cinematic version of he-said/she-said outside the walls of a courtroom, the film is pillared perfectly by its cast as well as its crew. Ben Affleck's interpretation of Nick Dunne draws fine lines of empathy and calmness, as well as unhappiness and deception for his wife and the people in his mundane, quickly shattering life. Nick's character, charming throughout the first act of the film, like any other man, shares his concerns about marital life, self-image, and the mistakes he makes as a man and as a husband. Affleck has never been better; yet, the next Caped Crusader isn't the true runaway star of Gone Girl. Pike, who has always given her best supporting big names like Tom Cruise in Jack Reacher, Carey Mulligan in An Education and Pierce Brosnan as 007 in Die Another Day, gives the performance of her lifetime as Amy Dunne. Amy is tormented, bored, and pushed to the threshold of her marriage and her dignity. While the narrative is presented through Nick, Amy herself and a journal she had conveniently written prior to the anniversary, show glimpses of a very scary, brooding monster housewife. Together with her husband, Amy is the ideal spouse. Once alone and given her space, Pike's submergence into the role brings chills to the very core of your spine in her portrayal of a wife who is capable of everything a woman thinks, but would never dare do. If Pike does not get award attention for her role as Amy this year, I don't know what will.",10,0,12,7 October 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," FIlm Review: The Amazing Spider-Man 2/www.nightfilmreviews.com
","If the new Spider-Man could represent one thing, it would be hope; hope that Sony can deliver as Disney and Paramount Pictures have with its Marvel mammoth The Avengers cannon; hope that their reboot is a successful and advancing platform towards a very large and lucratively sinister franchise future; and hope that will restore faith in the amazing-ness in its highly popular comic book wall-crawling character after a trilogy not too long ago. Spider-Man is undoubtedly a symbol of hope; a beacon of goodness; an ideal for morality. Growing up, Spider-Man was and continues to be one of my favourite comic book characters. Riding on emotion and sentiment, the web head is a fictional comic book character written as imperfectly as you and me.Making his fifth entry on the big screen in just twelve years in Marc Webb's second instalment of the Amazing Spider-Man series, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is less amazing and more routine. At times, the film shines as a gemstone indie love story similar to Webb's breakout hit, then, just seconds later, becomes a highly explosive and corny PG suitable Transformers imitation. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is as confused a film as its lead human character Peter Parker, taking too many liberties with his story yet trying to stay true to the comic book character Stan Lee and Steve Ditko created over fifty years ago. Thankfully, actor Andrew Garfield suits up again and holds the emotional scenes of the film together as the wise-cracking identity confused teenager, nailing every subtle and bold Peter Parker nuance while facing off against many obstacles and three very teed off villains in what has been marketed as 'his greatest battle yet'. With the exception of Sam Raimi's Spider-Man 3, the last of Raimi's trilogy with the character and a total train wreck, the films seem to be making a slow but steady decline in narrative, quality filmmaking and heart–and the same could be said with The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Rebooting the series in 2012 for the sole purpose of making great use of movie theatres current obsession of 3D and applying it to Spidey's first person metropolitan web-swinging, the point- of-view filming approach makes up for mere minutes of the film, usually focusing on the tormented personality of Peter Parker and the difficult choices he needs to make, as both a man and a hero, which was already visited in the first trilogy. Not that we are expecting a film to be made in the same way as the disastrous POV bomb Doom, but if the studio did decide to revisit a highly successful series only years after the first one was complete, at least make it worth while for the audience to drop the $20 for admission.In the first Amazing Spider-Man film, Webb's narrative felt like a familiar story of Peter Parker with a new villain. Thankfully, the series was able to pick up massive talent with a director who flourishes in his ability to flesh out the fine chemistry between his actors as seen with 500 Days of Summer and is able to create highly emotional, gut-wrenching bonds between lovers, friends, allies and enemies. With the talented Mr.Webb behind the lens, the Amazing franchise brought Peter Parker more vividly to life with the passionate and caring Andrew Garfield, who proved on many occasions how humbled and dedicated he was highlighting a side of Peter Parker in a way that Tobey Maguire never could. His interactions with his aunt and love interests Gwen are the best scenes in the film, hands down. Kudos to Ms. Emma Stone, who brings Peter Parker's first love Gwen Stacy to life with pizazz and spunk for a second time and finally rids herself of all the Emma Stone nuances that made her performance distracting in the first film.Picking up exactly where the last film left off in terms of secrets and mysteries, the film opens up to a flashback of Peter Parker's parent's disappearance. Richard and Mary Parker (Campbell Scott and Embeth Davidtz) leave New York and their son behind after double-crossing Oscorp. Flash forward nearly two decades and their son is saving the big apple in his blue and red spandex suit, one fallen fruit at a time.One of the most interesting mythos behind Spider-Man is his bond with humanity and his internal struggle. Spider-Man is cocky and comical throughout the film, usually minimizing the severity of the action and violence going on around him. Meanwhile, Peter Parker is a highly emotional and tragic character whose curse lays in his inability to distance himself from the people he loves the most. Spider-Man narratives have always been about making choices, choosing paths and learning from one's mistakes. Almost all the comic book characters getting the big screen treatment have been adapting what I like to call The Dark Knight formula; a formula that allows its characters to somewhat be rooted in reality, adding a drizzle of grittiness. Spider-Man seems to be one of the few, if not only, comic book character on the silver screen today who maintains his childish, goofy and often times overly-comical approach, adding colourful hints of appropriate teenage-ness. Sadly, unlike many other famous comic book characters, Spidey's world is one that is conquered constantly by the death of others, a theme that is in no way easy to swallow for children or teenagers–making the film a topsy-turvy tonal mess.One of the biggest question marks in this film was whether Gwen would make it out alive or not. Webb's film franchise introduced Gwen and allows Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone) to be the sole love interest in Peter Parker's life. Check out the full review at www.nightfilmreviews.com!",6,0,3,9 May 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Film Review: Guardians of the Galaxy
","Who would have thought that Marvel's next highly entertaining, multi-million (hopeful billion) dollar cinematic adventure would be set in a futuristic space world, whose tonal and narrative flow is shaped around a retro-filled soundtrack with songs dating from the 1960's to 1980's? With hits including Blue Swede's Hooked On a Feeling, The Runaway's Cherry Bomb, The Jackson 5's I Want You Back and Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell's Ain't No Mountain High Enough, Marvel Studios Guardians of the Galaxy is the epitome of silly, mindless fun at the movies. I'm not sure what Marvel Studios obsession with Marvin Gaye may be currently, but after having the song Trouble Man dictate the narrative for the highly impressive Captain America: The Winter Soldier earlier this year, it seems that the powerhouse studio is repossessing old concepts and ideas, and polishing them up quite nicely. With a bit of frantic, highly busy visual effects as well as engrossing dark physical and illicit family comedy, and presenting them in exuberantly exciting fashion for people of all ages to enjoy, Guardians of the Galaxy is a clear-cut winner. There is no denying that Guardians may very well be Marvel's own Star Wars for a new generation of highly diverse and eager young film goers; the film, which is inspired by the classic series, also does a great job spoofing much of the universe brought to life by George Lucas in the seventies. Guardians is, in many senses of the phrase, a roller-coaster ride of a film whose intention of fun is never questioned. If ever Disney wanted to shape a theme park ride around any of their properties, Guardians would surely be their best bet–never mind Pirates.Geek culture has officially taken over cineplexes, and for the most part, so will Chris Pratt, whose turn as Peter Quill a.k.a Star-Lord, will surely be the clear victor at this weekend's box office. Quill, a rambunctious outlaw whose fame as a nuisance to the galaxy is as important as his alias, leads a rag-tag group of criminal misfits to iconic hero status. Like most heroes, Quill isn't quite sure he knows he's a hero yet. Stealing and collecting junk from around the universe on his filthy Corvette-like spaceship he uses more like a bedroom for alien women than as a means of transport, Quill finally steals something so powerful, it threatens to destroy the world and him, forever. But unlike Indiana Jones, Quill doesn't have to dodge booby-traps and outrun giant boulders, instead he just has to deal with an array of peculiar characters including; a crew of awful aiming mercenaries loyal to Ronan (Lee Pace) led by Korath (Djimon Hounsou), bounty hunters Rocket (a genetically modified, wise cracking raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper), a humanoid tree Groot (voice by Vin Diesel), an assassin Gamora (Zoe Saldana) and a murderous maniac intent on vengeance Dax the Destroyer (former wrestler Dave Bautista).Eventually, everyone involved with Quill and the orb he has stolen are imprisoned (except the bad guys of course). In prison, the five begin unlikely friendships based on trust, sacrifice and intimidation that allows them to escape prison and set a course to a buyer, The Collector (Benecio Del Toro) who will stop at nothing to have the newly stolen possession in his hands. Upon discovering Quill's possession of the orb, Ronan gets direct orders from Thanos (Josh Brolin) to retrieve it. Led by his muscle Nebula (Karen Gillan), Ronan and his dark army go to extensive corners of the galaxy to retrieve the orb, and kill anyone in their way.Guardians can rest assure that it is by no means a revolutionary film to defies the boundaries of the superhero narrative and the 'stop the bad guy from destroying the world' clichéd storyline we have come to love and hate. Thankfully, the film is a practice of clever humour and nuanced physical slapstick that make its way into the superhero genre. Pratt does a star-lording job of leading a fresh group of actors to new heights in super hero comedy as well as interacting and getting the most from his voice cast.Director James Gunn (Slither, Super) whose previous work makes no indication at all that his fit in Marvel's world of intergalactic superheroes would work, does a surprisingly fantastic job writing and directing obscure comic book characters. Obvious losers in the comic book world, Gunn does an amazing job of making the Guardians cinematic heroes whose allure on screen, consisting of saturated visual effects and computer generated imagery, make for one of the greatest complete ensemble of the summer. So what if his overly ambitious score is distracting to viewers during intense scenes of built up drama and highly concentrated action. Gunn, has us, from the films first frames, hooked on a feeling of nostalgia and escapism that we haven't felt for a long time.Guardians is in no way a galactic achievement in the world of villains and heroes. Pace, who originally auditioned for the role of Quill, is wooden, unrecognizable and suffers greatly from any real ability to scare his audience with fear or threat. With the occasional close-up to the dark eyes or tarred teeth, Ronan is quickly overshadowed and squashed by the menaced-voice, short presence of Thanos. With the promise of such an iconic villain's chaos and the repercussions it will have in the world of the Avengers and now the Guardians, the film is very much an introductory film with very little new superhero material and rather a pastiche of potential for bigger threats and danger for future instalments.",8,3,6,8 August 2014
Selma," Film Review: Selma/www.nightfilmreviews.com
","There are certain people and events throughout history that are so obviously in need of a cinematic treatment, that their absence from the big screen leaves audiences wondering what on earth took so long. Such is the case with the one of the most recognizable and referenced figures in Western society, Dr. Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. This larger than life individual whose life and accomplishments are far too grand for a simple studio feature film, has luckily never been subjected to an impoverished movie. Instead, Dr. King is assimilated as a key figure in Ava DeVernay's re-telling of the events in Selma, Alabama. DeVernay illustrates the movement organized by Dr. King which brought to light the fact that although African American's (predominantly in the South) had the constitutional right to vote, they had not seen a registered vote cast for over sixty years. Just like the events that unfolded throughout the worldwide broadcasting of Bloody Sunday, the march in Selma was a fair catalyst to the establishment of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a bill that gave all Americans equal opportunity to exercise their democratic rights. It is without a doubt that MLK is an influential figure who sadly suffered the same tragic fate of other great American figures including Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy. This doom alone could easily make for an explosive and easily appealing studio film for large audiences. Though, what detaches Selma from other biopics and sets it up amongst the greats, like Steven Spielberg's recent Lincoln, is its focus on a specific period in time; allowing the events and characters to unfold in fine cinematic fashion around these prevalent historical shifts on the world. Biopics may not be the go-to genre for spoilers, twist-endings, and large box-offices, but movies like Selma reaffirm the fine tailored approach of filmmakers looking to retell the milestones of world history and offer exceptional character insight on the visionaries we have immortalized.Selma may seem too daunting to many, serving more of a history lesson with real violent historical events–that is Bloody Sunday, than an entertaining piece of film discouraging potential viewers. Instead, the film chronicles both the violent and peaceful moments of the period with COMPLETE eloquence and patience, allowing Selma to become one of the most vivid and colourful history lessons we have seen on screen in a long time. More than anything, Selma depicts an important piece of American history for a time that needs reaffirmed confidence and faith in the goodness and changes people are willing to make everyday.Timely in its fashion for the current events plaguing the United States today, the film is a heavy- handed, dramatic and necessary piece of cinematic awareness for a country whose civil views have not changed much for almost fifty years. Scarily mimicking the events of Ferguson, Mo. and the current issues circling America, Selma becomes a contemporary mandatory viewing for all people–of all race and colour.Director DuVernay, approaches a monumental cinematic achievement with many obstacles. Wishes of Dr. King's kin that DuVernay and screenwriter Paul Webb not incorporate any original speeches left the film's representation of the most pivotal character with the potential lack of authenticity.Overcoming this, DuVernay and Webb stray away from the monumental 'I Have A Dream' speech, as well as the obvious tragedy of Dr.King's assassination, instead displaying a relatable leader with humanistic flaws: characteristics many would otherwise be oblivious to. On top of the film's apparent issues of gaining rights from Dr. King's family (similar to All Is By My Side and the music of Jimi Hendrix), the film also endured a strenuous identity crisis, with the possibility of being helmed by the likes of; Steven Spielberg, Michael Mann, Spike Lee, Paul Haggis, Stephen Frears (attached with Oyelowo to star), and Lee Daniels fresh off of his other civil rights film The Butler. Yet, easily foreseeable by her previous delicate work I Will Follow and Middle of Nowhere, no one seems more qualified or destined to bring life to the events of Selma than DuVernay; a- once resident of Alabama herself and a director whose voice and view of the eventful day on the Edmund Pettus Bridge changed the United States and its people forever.Never constraining itself to the obvious location, Selma also offers insight to the importance of ego and its development into its own character in the lives of the Selma marchers. Shutting great men down permanently and unequivocally through scenes of extreme prejudice, racism and struggle, characters such as President Lyndon B. Johnson (Tom Wilkinson), CIA founder J. Edgar Hoover (Dylan Baker), Malcolm X (Nigel Thatch), and Governor George Wallace (Tim Roth) give depth to the many facets of politics and the agendas of men throughout that time, and their priorities to the American people. Seeing such amazing talent in one of the best ensemble casts of the year, Dr.King's interactions with elite politicians (most specifically those with Wilkinson, who offers some of his best recent work since Michael Clayton) shines.Yet, no matter how big the name or actor is, some of the best scenes of the film are those with the less recognizable figures during the civil rights movement; including a scene between a grieving Cager Lee Jackson PLAYED by Henry G. Sanders (father of the slain Jimmi Lee Jackson PLAYED by Short Term 12's Keith Stanfield) as well as a quietly insightful yet tremendously uplifting scene between Dr.King and a then John Lewis (played by star-in-the-making Toronto native Stephan James).",9,1,3,13 February 2015
Sicario," Film Review: Sicario
","Scorching with the dry and arid heat of the desert land, an aerial view of Phoenix, Arizona fills the opening screen of French Canadian director Denis Villenueve's newest feature Sicario. Sweaty, pulsating with uncanny tension and trumpeting with constant uncertainty, it seems that the land in which Sicario is based on is inhabited solely by the ravenous animals of the desert; and no, it isn't referring to the four-legged desert beasts hungry for blood.Premiering at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier in the season, Villeneuve's newest film seems to touch upon a current trend plaguing all new outlets, artistic commentaries and current events; immigration, and not just at a national level, but from a very large and vast international one.Sicario takes places in the rural desert areas of Arizona and Mexico, setting the tone for a very corrupt and dangerous world where Mexican cartels rule the land, and the sounds of gunshots are as frequent as the cries of wolves. Drug cartels keep citizens in fear, police are as corrupt as the cartels themselves, and the efforts of the United States and their universal judiciary right for 'peace' is as subtle as the low-efficiency Black SUV's snaking their way through the hot highway pavements. With the high exposure of Trump's high-attention media-driven campaign, as well as age-old conflicts between land, boarders and people in other areas of the world, the issues of immigration are as universal as the numeric system, which makes Villeneuve a perfect candidate to direct a wrought, unbiased and highly effective piece of fiction and reality.Yet, with all its high-profile media attention and concurrent position in all the headlines, Sicario doesn't soar to its conventional storyline of corruption and intrigue of mystery for loyalties and alliances; the film itself exceeds due to its honest portrayal of people playing people, dealing in real ways with the abundance of injustice and violence.The spearhead of these real people is highlighted by the impeccable performance from Emily Blunt. Blunt, who trades in glam for grit, plays Kate Macer, an idealistic Special Weapons and Tactical Team agent who believes in justice and the greater good. During a routine kidnapping raid, Macer and her trusty partner, Reggie Wayne (Daniel Kaluuya), encounter a total of forty-two corpses hidden within the walls of the abandoned home, as well as an explosive device that detonates, killing two officers, and wounding Kate and Reggie. With the aftermath of the explosion behind them, Kate is offered a position working for the CIA and Department of Defence, lead by the egotistical and reckless Matt Graver (Josh Brolin). Using brute force and unconventional and highly illegal methods of dismantling the Mexican drug cartel, the special unit, paired with the help of a very mysterious and highly intimidating Alejandro (Benecio Del Toro), break the rules of law in order to get their men.Sicario is an uncomfortable film, in every sense of the word. Recommending the film would be a hard sell. If it wasn't for the always spectacular Del Toro, who chimes in an Oscar worthy supporting performance that requires very little dialogue, but masterful minimalist acting, the film itself isn't the most commercial in theatres. The intensity of the film stays true to the very blurred lines of federal justice while crossing State lines; constantly being under strict surveillance. Although the characters seem to be always out of their own jurisdiction, Kate seems to be the teams only voice of reason. It becomes quite clear early on, that everyone else in the ops are crossing the rules of the terrain, forcing Kate to bend her very strong and unwavering moral conscious. What might appear to be a very annoying character trait, in reality becomes a selling feature as Kate's ability to humanize the very barbaric people around her is something audiences admire, not begrudge.Much like the memorable performance from Del Toro's Alejandro, Sicario embodies the characteristics of the most memorable strong, silent type characters in cinema. Without over- stimulating the senses in the way Hollywood knows how to, Sicario never lets up its aggressive demeanour, despite its scarcity. Thanks to the wonderful work of Jòhann Jòhannsson (Prisoners, The Theory of Everything, Foxcatcher), who sets an unsettling score with natural sounds of harmful creatures (buzzing of bees, howling of wolves), the film's score paces the very slow moving material at a very heavy and fluid pace. Matched with the wonderful cinematography of master Roger Deakins, the confident and tremendous direction of Villeneuve, and phenomenal transformation of Blunt as Kate, Sicario is one of the most, if not most, complete films of 2015, in all regards, cinematically speaking.Visually, the film is a diamond in the rough. Deakins, the most deserving man working in the world of cinema for an Academy Award, blends his previous knowledge of shooting No Country for Old Men, which took a very open scope desert and added hints and cues of blue and orange, and transformed a landscaped soaked in the red of innocent men's blood, and added a humanistic and unmeasurable grainy quality to the film that elevates the notion of feuding neighbouring countries to alarming heights.Written by actor turned writer extraordinaire Taylor Sheridan, much of the film's script is guiding by the gazes of promise and the hope for change. Yet, the film itself is a violent and very realistic facade of impossible compromise and shattered dreams. Graver, a jokester and impressionable man with very shaky loyalties, at one point in the film, taunts Kate with lines like, 'you are dramatically overreacting' or 'you saw things you shouldn't have seen'. While Alejandro assures Kate that no matter what actions are taken by the team, 'Nothing will make sense to your American ears'. It is through these desensitized scenarios that many of the muddled strategies of governments, bureaus and of individuals can never really be truly understood in the eyes of other people; which becomes the greatest dichotomy of Sicario.",9,0,1,3 February 2016
Steve Jobs," Film Review: Steve Jobs
","It is often stated that the line between insanity and genius is measured only by success. When discussion turns to that of one's genius, we find it difficult not to equate that genius with some level of insanity. This is especially true when that discussion focuses on Steve Jobs, the man behind machines that allows us to hold the world in the palm of our hand. Steve Jobs is not simply a film, but is an experience of perception; of history; and of a household name.When evaluating Steve Jobs the film, one has to stop and admire the genius of writer Aaron Sorkin. The Academy Award winner extends the parameters of his brilliance through a film that not only allows us an understanding of a complex mind, but accurately illustrates the torments, criticisms and neglect that shaped the man entrusted with its ownership. Based on Walter Isaacson's non- fiction memoir, Sorkin's script rockets off the tongues of the film's talented cast and grabs your attention as you dance through every nuanced conflict of Jobs' life. Daringly mimicking theatre in its three-piece act structure, the film presents the events of three major launches, and three very different pictures of Steve Jobs (Michael Fassbender), in real time.The first, shot in low-resolution 16mm film, set in Cupertino, California, shows a grainy and young Jobs moments before his inaugural Macintosh in 1984, days after the infamous science fiction based Apple commercial. The second, showing the recently axed Jobs, in 1988 at the historical San Francisco Opera House before his infamously disastrous NeXT cube launch in widescreen 35mm film displays a vengeful and highly orchestrated Jobs. Finally, in 1998, returning to Apple, this time as CEO, utilising high-definition digital film at San Francisco's Davies Symphony Hall, before his presentation of the iMac. The last act presents to the audience the most human yet morally flawed version of a man no one ever really understood. Each scene, running close to thirty five minutes each, is as enthralling, entertaining and orchestrated as the next.Jobs has always maintained a very muddled and misguided personal life; one that includes a young daughter Lisa with a college sweetheart Christen Brennan (Katherine Waterston), very uninspiring social skills as well as a knack for being referred to as unlovable. Sorkin's script looks to answer one of the biggest questions plaguing the late great tech genius: can a great man still be a good man? Thanks to an electric script by the great Aaron Sorkin, phenomenal performances on all fronts, masterful direction and a brilliant neo-classical score by Daniel Pemberton, Steve Jobs is easily a crowning cinematic achievement and the best film of 2015, in spite of not being the most audience alluring film released this award season.From the beginning, the film is a pish-posh of gossip and rumours. Not that anyone thought the film would bow down to the atrocious Ashton Kutcher vehicle Jobs in 2013, but the film did suffer a slew of 'technical difficulties' going into production. Once in the hands of David Fincher, the film was always setup to be as great, if not greater than The Social Network. With Christian Bale initially cast, the film went through directors, stars and crew like a Daytona racetrack, eventually settling on director Danny Boyle, and stars Michael Fassbender and Daniel Pemberton instead of a roster that may very well have included Fincher, Bale, Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Luckily for audiences, Steve Jobs is not an unwanted and pumped out studio biopic, and focuses less on the look of Jobs and more on the essence of a man struggling with himself more than the struggles of an economically competitive technological world.While the film is presented in a very basic three act structure, there is nothing simple about the film. Driven by dialogue, its characters and three very crucial times in the life of Steve Jobs, the abstract delivery of these highly regarded singular events of the 20th century are presented with ease and class.In a world where recognition is everything, and being pointed out in humiliation and failure could forever change your reputation professionally, Steve Jobs, logically speaking, had no right becoming a pioneer of technology. He was no engineer, designer or programmer, yet, the world knew his name and the ramifications of his brilliance. In one of the many powerful scenes of the film, when confronted by his cohort and early friend, Apple Co-Founder Steve 'Woz' Wozniak (Seth Rogen) what he does. In response, Jobs says, 'I play the orchestra!' Often times being measured next to Leonardo Da Vinci, Julius Ceasar and God himself, Jobs was often misconceived as a diabolical man with a plan, giving out the passes to whomever came in his way.While many may be very discouraged to see the film, with fear that a biopic of a gifted tech guru would be overwhelmed with difficult tech-inspired lingo, the film is a well balanced feature showcasing moments of extreme drama, emotion and heart. Many of these scenes are anchored with Jobs by himself, the women in his life, father figure and late CEO of Apple John Sculley (Jeff Daniels) and friends. The emotions in the film hold together the very fine strains of intensity and drive the white-knuckled pace of the film overall.Holding the very intimate moments of the film are the women in Steve Jobs; an old flame Chrisann, his daughter Lisa (played by Makenzie Moss at 5, Ripley Sobo at 9, and Perla Haney-Jardine at age 19) and the only person who ever stands up to Jobs, Joanna Hoffman (Kate Winslet). Sorkin, who has more than enough substance with his male leads, uses the women in Jobs' life to draw out the kinks in the suit of amour Jobs so easily shows us, dealing with simple issues of patriarchy, ego, and image.",10,1,4,3 February 2016
12 Years a Slave," Review:12 Years A Slave Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","Despite its relentlessly violent and disturbing content, the film is a must watch. The beauty of a film titled 12 Years A Slave, is it's straightforwardness and self-aware narration. Like so many movies before it, this remarkable tale of Solomon Northup's unbelievable journey of survival, may not be familiar from the character names, but the story shares many narrative arcs of other slavery driven melodramas. Fortunately for us, 12 Years a Slave breaks its cliché stigma thanks simply to one of the greatest living directors working today, Steve McQueen. McQueen, an enigmatic British story teller, has had indie success since his riveting Hunger and more importantly, the sadly overlooked Shame. Having an incredible visual understanding as well as dramatically perverse eye, McQueen captures an unapologetic and extraordinary film of the tackle of evil, and the eventual glory of justice.12 Years a Slave is a film based heavily off of Solomon Northup's memoir Twelve Years A Slave. Gestating from Solomon's life as an acclaimed violinist, to the cruel unwilling insertion of Solomon to slavery in the Deep South, the film takes very little liberties of Northup's brave literary piece. Chronicling Solomon's decade plus of slavery, from plantation overseers to slave owners, and all the people that he meets in-between, Northup the man, and the character, is truly a testament to the extent of the human spirt and the marvel of selfishness and tolerance.Slavery is a subject that cannot be ignored when flipping through the pages of history books, especially American history. As sad as it is to admit, slavery is just as much a part of learning of the past as glory and success is. The thing about the subject of slavery when it comes to the film medium is that audiences already know what to expect; lashings, whippings, lynching, sexual and physical abuse, injustice and unexplainable cruelty. The difference between knowing these facts and seeing them on the screen, is the emotional response the poetic visuals provide. Like any spectacular painting, this moving piece of art is like any paint-to-canvas product, more stunning and hypnotizing the longer you stare at it.Many could argue that 12 Years A Slave is an overly dramatized, artsy recantation of a man's struggle to freedom. From grueling, neck-breaking long takes, to several extreme close ups, to musically laden chants, the film is a fine piece of cinematic showcasing for its director and many talented individuals involved. 12 Years A Slave is, without a doubt, McQueen's most commercial work. But do not get discouraged, because unlike so many talented directors in the past to substitute commercial success with artificial, flaky pieces of cinema, McQueen uses his talent to attract one of the film's most talented qualities, its cast.Unflinching and naturally statuesque is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who will no doubt get some Oscar recognition, and perhaps even a win for his enslaving portrayal of Solomon Northup. Ejiofor inhabits a passion of previous confident actors in his role as Northup similar to that of Poiteir, Washington and Redford. From the start of McQueen's body of work, one of the most noticeable and gratifying similarity all three lead males share, is the control and power of their gaze. From Michael Fassbender in Hunger and Shame, and now to Ejiofor in 12 Years, Ejiofor and McQueen create a fiery, personal relationship of gazes and stares that act as another character for audience members to empathize with. Whether it be on a train, hungrily undressing a redhead in the opening scene of Shame, to a hopeful yet empty stare into the humid swamps of the South, it is in these simplistic stares and silent revelations where we weep, we cry, and we feel an immense sorrow for a man stripped of everything.Along with Ejiofor and also destined for Oscar recognition is Lupita Nyong'o. Accepting and willing to succumb to death rather than live a life of slavey and the apple of her owner Edwin Epps' (Michael Fassbender) affection, Nyong'o delivers in a way that could only be best described as classical and timeless; a way that only Jane Eyre enthusiasts could comprehend.Sharing in the glory of McQueen's amazing ability to retrieve the best performances from his actors, are of course, Michael Fassbender, frequent collaborator and McQueen's muse, as the epitome of evil Edwin Epps; to Paul Giamatti as the inhumane slave merchant; to Benedict Cumberbatch as the remorseful Master Ford; to Scoot McNairy as the deceitful Mr. Brown; to the always brilliant Paul Dano as the crippling Mr. Tibeats, and of course the ingenious Brad Pitt as the heroic Canadian carpenter Mr. Bass, this film will serve as a definite fine point in all the careers of these already talented acting forces.12 Years A Slave is all around, a solid example of the fine points of collaboration. John Ridely's script is a brilliant literary work that excels most during the lyrical and doomed dialogues between slaves. Composer Hans Zimmer orchestrates a chilling score that, at moments, gives hope, and at other times, deepens one's sorrow. The film is a great, big authoritative film of the finest artists working in Hollywood today.Chances are, 12 Years A Slave will chill your warm heart and bury any previous empathy for the slaves in Tarantino's Django Unchained into the dirt. There is no silver lining here; McQueen's sprawling slavery epic is a depressing, death-filled account of past reality. In each blood- soaked, flesh-pealing, naturally cinematic scene, McQueen finds the beauty in torture, the art in tragedy and most of all, the passion of perseverance and hope, despite all. 12 Years A Slave will undoubtedly be one of my favourite films of the year. And rest assured, once its hold loosens and the chains drop, 12 Years A Slave will survive as one of the year's most memorable stories of hope, and will live on to be a modern American classic.Night Film Reviews: 10/10 Stars.",10,1,5,11 November 2013
The Water Diviner," Film Review: The Water Diviner
","In June of 2015 one of my favourite HBO shows of all time will make its debut on the silver screen. While Entourage may not be the greatest television show ever created, it sure does succeed in allowing its main demographic to fantasize about fame and fortune. It is true that the Entourage film has very little to almost zero relevance to The Water Diviner, but its subject matter (a very eager Hollywood star, in this case, the fictional Vincent Chase making his directorial film debut) does. Now you may be asking, what is the point here? What many won't know is that The Water Diviner marks the directorial debut of famed New Zealand born, Australian loving actor Russell Crowe. Sharing in his immense adoration for the land down under with fellow famed Hollywood actors Hugh Jackman and Hugo Weaving, Crowe directs this film centred around the Gallipoli Campaign, also known as The Battle of Gallipoli, and Australian farmer/water diviner, Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe).Years after the initial battles, Joshua and his wife Eliza (Jacqueline McKenzie) have done the best they can grieving with the reality of losing all three sons to the war. Essentially, The Water Diviner becomes a great cinematic tale about hope, survival, and determination, soaked with an immense amount of inexperience by its very trying but lacking director.Hope is a big theme within the film, and going back to the analogy mentioned in the first paragraph, the same could be said for many upcoming actors turned directors. While the trend of acting-to-directing is nothing new (Clint Eastwood, Ron Howard, and of course, Ben Affleck), it is something that many actors try, gaining knowledge and great aspiration from their confident directing leaders, but fail miserably. Just ask Ryan Gosling and his 2014 Cannes flop Lost River. While The Water Diviner may be considered anything but a flop, the film does seem quite familiar very quickly. Taking cues from very popular and hailed contemporary war dramas in the last few decades, Saving Private Ryan and Flags of Our Fathers most notably, Crowe's directorial debut is a beautifully shot, but poorly guided historical picture.High handed melodrama, non-conspicuous zooms during very pivotal narrative scenes and monologues, as well as the oh-so painful use of unnecessary slow-motion, The Water Diviner is ever so slightly taken away from a compelling story of patriarch and redemption. Against all odds Joshua makes his way to Gallipoli, a land labelled as a stretch of Earth saturated with 'blood and ghosts', where he is greeted by Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), a military official who is tasked with helping Lt./Col Cyril Hughes (Jai Courtney in his second straight historical war epic following Unbroken) adequately bury fellow countrymen. While most of the film is driven by blind and unexplainable intuition, Joshua finds two of his sons, Henry and Edward Connor (Ben O'Toole and James Fraser), who remain together. Not knowing the whereabouts of the remains of his eldest Arthur (Ryan Corr), who had been tasked with guarding his two youngest brothers, Joshua never loses faith in the chance of seeing his first-born.While much of the film narrative is driven by prospect, Major Hasan informs Joshua that he remembers his son in a chance encounter and gives him hope that he may still be alive, leading Joshua to Istanbul where divinely, he finds himself in the care of a recently widowed Ayshe's (Olga Kurylenko) hotel. It is there that Joshua slowly sheds his Commonwealth patriotism of Queen and Country beginning to open his eyes to the customs and lifestyle of the Turkish people, including that of Ayshe and her son Orhan (Dylan Georgides).While romance never plays a strong influence on the film between Joshua and Ayshe, some of the best scenes are undoubtedly between Crowe and Kurylenko as well as Crowe and Turkish acting gem Erdogan. Many won't be astonished by Crowe's direction but he can rest assured, after the atrocities that were Noah, Winter's Tale and Broken City, that his acting is in top form in The Water Diviner, proving scene and scene again that his talents as an actor are far from finished. Luckily, the casting and acting of the film is undoubtedly its strong point, including former Bond girl Kurylenko who is almost unrecognizable as Ayshe.Russell Crowe may not be the next Orson Welles, Rob Reiner, or Kenneth Branagh – men whose directorial debuts and first feature films Citizen Kane, This is Spinal Tap! and Henry V respectfully established their talents behind the lens as well as in front of the camera – but there is definitely hope for a very talented and ambitious man who is willing to shed light to some very obscure historical events. Crowe will surely be given a slew of elements in the fight to get his film seen and appreciated. While I won't be one to truly drown The Water Diviner, here's hoping that Crowe's first feature will have greater hope of keeping afloat than sinking quickly, despite its lack of any real cinematic divine intervention.",7,3,8,1 June 2015
Fifty Shades of Grey," Film Review: Fifty Shades of Grey/www.nightfilmreviews.com
","I bet that if I were to ask the majority of the main demographic watching Fifty Shades of Grey this weekend what the acronym BDSM stands for, I would get a very unsatisfied and baffled answer. Low and behold, welcome to the world of popular culture and worldwide phenomenas for no damn good reason.If someone were to ask me, how and why this particular novel, written atrociously by British author E.L. James became such a huge success, I wouldn't know where to begin. Upon all the controversy, arguments and opinions about the novel and its depiction of submissive sexual culture, I guess we, as a general population, have to accept the fact that sometimes, people and certain pieces of pop culture, just get lucky for being around at the right place, at the right time.It's not like erotic literature or erotic novels didn't exist before E.L. James' novel, its that THIS particular novel caught on with readers and has become the worldwide best-seller for the simple fact that, it just did. Upon learning about my advance sneak passes to the film, I went in with the highest level of professionalism and optimism possible, but when a film knows its going to be a hit, regardless of its talent and execution on screen, you pretty well have sealed your fate in the world of film criticism.I'm not sure if the actors and screenwriter Kelly Marcel intended for the dialogue and execution of the film to be so wooden, laughable and campy, but I guess when you are adapting a film to a novel that has been deemed unworthy of professional publication, regardless of your level of screen writing and acting skills, you can't do much. From the moment the screen is filled with the shaded lighting of corporate florescent bulbs in the Grey building, one cannot help but notice how little effort is put into the film's production.Set around one of the most conventional narrative foundations ever, Fifty Shades of Grey is your typical Romeo and Juliet love story of forbidden love. Upon learning of her friend Kate's (Eloise Mumford) illness, Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) is forced by her best friend to cover for school newspaper's article upcoming interview with the mysterious and intimidating business magnate Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan). Once Ana and Christian meet, the two begin a steamy and sensual relationship filled with singular sexual tastes, obsession, seduction and mental and emotional pain and pleasure. Yup, thats it.Before the film even started production, the casting process gain high media attention. Having Angelina Jolie reject directing the film, Chritian Cooke, Dominic Cooper and Stephen Amell circling the role of Christian Grey, and talented actresses Felicity Jones, Elizabeth Olsen, Imogen Poots and Shailene Woodley reportedly being considered and auditioning for the role of Ana Steele, the cast was settled with Dakota Johnson and Charlie Hunnam. Hunnam, who withdrew from the film due to a backlash of media frenzied fans who said the role simply wasn't meant for the actor, officially abandoned the project and was replaced by Dornan. Notice how more is being written about the casting history of the film more than the plot itself?The lead actors of the film, must have approached the role as a double edged sword of fame and credibility. For one, Johnson and Dornan are destined of becoming household names, especially with the promise of huge economic gain, given the novels already huge fan base and demands of sequels. Yet, Fifty Shades of Grey brings to question one very important question: are artists and actors, willing to sacrifice their artistic integrity for fame and fortune? I mean, how else could one describe the leads being able to learn and mesmerize their lines in only five days?Fifty Shades of Grey did not upset me as much as I thought it would. What upsets me most about this highly questionable and overwhelmingly popular phenomena is its misuse in everyday people's lives and the misleading conception of romance and its force for capitalist gain. Whereas, this time of year, romantic films are cleverly slotted before the Valentine's Day week, this is one film that abandons romance and the pure notion of 'love' for sole monetary gain. Do people really care to be the submissive? Is there going to be a surge in toys and fetish tools thanks to the film? Quite possibly. How else do you explain an officially marketed branding of fifty shades sex toys and fetish equipment at your local sex store?Fifty Shades of Grey is a film void of romance, as is the chemistry between its leads. Forcing to become lovers: one a submissive and one a dominant, is clearly seen between the chemistry of Johnson and Dornan. Looking more like two people exploring the world of James' highly clichéd and unoriginal imagination, Johnson and Dornan look strapped and tied to fake and cheap material within every frame. Hopefully, the scars and marks left from the production doesn't act as a metaphorical stain for these two talented actors for the rest of their careers by being typed casted.My biggest concern of the film is if, by forcing this popular notion of submission and dominance to young girls, charmed and enthralled by the glamorized and wholly unreal Christian Grey ever going to be taken advantage of by older, predatorily type males? What type of message does this source material and film send women who are naive, submissive, innocent and easily charmed by the erotically charged notion of rich men with high brow toys being able to get away with anything they want? Violence, language and difficult subject matters are always at the forefront of rating controversy, yet this film was easily given an R rating, when it's message is one that needs to be taken seriously and cautiously, especially for young women.",2,2,6,2 March 2015
Godzilla," Film Review: Godzilla/ www.nightfilmreviews.com
","In 2010, director Gareth Edwards made his way to the festival scene by ways of Monsters, a eco- centric, sci-fi hit that introduced audiences to the wonders of large scale destruction and monsters mixed with the small scale effects of the individual characters as well as making a name for the extremely talented Scoot McNairy (12 Years A Slave, Non-Stop). Think District 9 with monsters instead of aliens. Fast forward four years later, thanks to the critical success of his first full length indie feature, and Edwards, who has been given the keys to the commercial kingdom, is front and centre in adapting the King of Monsters in only the second Americanized version since the abysmal yet highly popcorn-crunchingly entertaining Godzilla remake from Roland Emmerich from 1998. Entrusted with a massive $160 million dollar budget from Warner Bros. Pictures, after acquiring the rights of the iconic beast from Toho in 2010, Edwards proves that Godzilla reigns at destroying one thing, and one thing only, the promise of young filmmakers career's. Godzilla is a large beast to discuss in one review or twenty-seven for that matter (since there has been about twenty-seven film adaptations of the beast) since his birth back in 1954. For his sixtieth birthday, Godzilla has been given the royal treatment, having its largest budget to date, a strong international cast, and the biggest presence on screen thanks to a belief that bigger is better. That belief is shot down with the help of this film. With screens growing in size (IMAX, AVX, etc.), ticket prices getting a radioactive hike and the God of Monsters terrorizing cities solely based on its sheer size, something's gotta give, but never does.For the first time in the creature's existence, Godzilla is not the centre of attention. In fact, the monster itself only makes up for mere minutes of the film. Adopting a very Nolan-esque, if not J.J Abrams approach to minimizing the beast's reveal before the film's premiere and within the film, Edwards focuses less on the destruction of Godzilla, and more on the presence monsters have on a small group of people on earth. Basically, a rehashing of Edwards' Monsters, with a much bigger budget.Unfortunately for Edwards, instead of keeping his vision and artistic integrity intact, he decides to allow Hollywood, and the symbol of Godzilla himself, to consume him, into something I like to call, the symptoms of a Hollywood film. Edwards succumbs to; foggy glass shots where characters wipe their windows for a big reveal at the monster; children noticing things before adults, monsters and rain (lots of it) and my favourite, crazy guy who proves us all that he wasn't crazy. Godzilla is one big 'told ya so', when the summer blockbuster season is a large example of so many times we go into a film, hoping to be surprised, but being delivered exactly what we expected instead.Like any other huge blockbuster film recently (see: The Watchmen, X: Men First Class, The Wolverine), the film begins to explain the origins of the giant lizard, this time dating it back to radioactive testings done in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the 1940′s. Deep rooted in one of the most tragic time's in our world's history, Dr. Ichiro Serizawa (Ken Wantanabe) explains how the radioactive bombs were done less as a test, and more of a means to destroy the unexplained and mysterious creature found deep in the ocean. Unknown to scientists then, but the monstrosity fed off the radiation being used, making it stronger as opposing to killing it. Since his disappearance, the God of Creatures has since been absent from the world. Until, in 1999, when engineer Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston in his most annoying role yet) experiences the devastation of electrical shocks taking out the power at his radioactive plant, that leads to chaos and causes him to lose his wife Sandra Brody (Juliette Binoche) and many of his co-workers. Left to raise his son Ford (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) alone, Ford grows up becoming a bomb specialist for the United States Army (how appropriate), distancing his father from his family due to his obsession with the mysteries of the events the day his wife was taken from him. Fifteen years later and after returning after fourteen months on tour, Ford returns to San Francisco to his wife Elle (Elizabeth Olsen) and his son Sam (Carson Bolde), only to be summoned by his father for some unfinished business that might lead the end of the world as we know it.The summer movie season has recently been infamous for spewing out relentless amounts of superhero films and unexpected heroes. Godzilla is no different than any of these films, finding an unlikely hero in the process of ripping the essence of the ferocity and symbolic destructive nature that is Godzilla. One of the biggest problems of this adaptation of Godzilla lies in the dubious marketing tactics for the film. In an early Comic Con trailer, the narration of the trailer suggests the creature's odious nature and pleasure with destruction. Based on earlier interpretations of the monster, these hints of originality and authenticity of the creature are not kept or upheld with any dignity at all for the iconic cinematic figure, instead thrown on its head and butchered.",2,1,4,27 May 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Film Review: Kingsman: The Secret Service
","Upon first glance, Kingsman: The Secret Service looks like an outdated, outlandish attempt to reinvigorate the action spy genre that saw Pierce Brosnan fail miserable as his final appearance as the famous spy-agent James Bond in The World is Not Enough. Since 2005, thanks to the likes of Martin Campbell and Christopher Nolan, two directors that took two very different iconic action figures, Batman and James Bond, and injected a much needed, gritty, dark, reality-based foundation to these characters and their overall narratives, over-the-top action has long been expired. In the last decade, what has arisen, is a very dark and realistically twisted take on many action icons, both in the superhero genre and the action hero genre, that allows the cartoonish elements of these characters to fade, and the realistic to rise in popular and rewarding box office results. One of these aforementioned films that inhabited a reality based narrative structure was the recently re-envisioned X-Men film franchise, which was, ironically, reinvented by Matthew Vaughn in X-Men: First Class in 2011. The film, which took place in 1962, set around the events of the Cuban Missile Crisis, showed just how much the comic book genre succeeded among audiences when introduced around real-world events.The amazing thing about Kingsman: The Secret Service, is that the same man who was responsible for breathing new, raw life into the X-Men franchise, after the disaster that Brett Ratnet's X-Men: The Last Stand was, is the same man that is bringing back the absolutely manic and outrageous spy-agent genre with a vengeance. Thankfully for everyone, Kingsman: The Secret Service is the action movie we have been waiting to see and the is the tremendously alternative to a highly unbelievable 007 movie that never came.Upon first view, I too was worried about the dynamics of Vaughn's newest Millar adaptation (Vaughn had already adapted Millar's Kick-Ass). Looking back at the trailers, the action looked silly; the players too clichéd in the world of agent-spy standards; and gimmicky thanks to the inclusion of adorable pugs and attractive cast members. Boy was I wrong!Kingsman is a highly calculated film romp that never takes itself too seriously, yet never lets go of its grip of highly entertaining action movie and escapism Hollywood fluff. To think that Vaughn could have potentially abandoned this project completely to make X-Men: Days of Future Past is sad. Thankfully, the highly visionary and confident filmmaker stuck to his guns, and delivers easily, one of the most entertaining films of 2015 thus far.Kingsman begins as any action movie should; with a girl. But this girl, is a recently widowed mother who surprisingly has a stranger visit her in the late night, to tell her that her husband, a Kingsman (unbestknown to her) was killed in the line of duty. The stranger, Harry Hart (Colin Firth), is unwelcome in the home, and focuses his energy to his partners newborn son, Eggsy (newcomer Taron Egerton), where he discloses to him that, if ever in the future he encounters any problems, the Kingsman are indebted to them forever thanks to the bravery of their patriarch.Flash forward a decade, and Eggsy is a troublesome youth, whose failed attempts in the marines, and trouble with the law finds his luck at the crap end, time and time again. It isn't until Eggsy, who in an act of defiance for his mother against her petty mafia boyfriend, finds himself in a police station, in deperate need of the Kingsmans help. After a quick phone call, that ends ambiguously, Eggsy is released of the police station and greeted by the same man who visited him and his mother upon the news of his father's death, Harry Hart. Luckily for Eggsy, Harry offers him a job interview, that could see him in the same line of work as his father, and could change his world forever thanks to an unexpected visit to a tailor shoppe.On the surface, Kingsman seems to be a neat and well dressed action film. Once cracked open, Kingsman is a rough, tough, cocky-filled fuel ride of adrenaline, bad manners and tailored attitude that puts James Bond and company to shame.Vaughn, whose decision to keep the material in his native English tongue, complete with attitude-filled cockney accents and strong British accents, breaths new life to the very apocalyptic world take over plans of the film's villain, and easily the best and most iconic villain of 2015, Richmond Valentine, played with such bravado and vigour by the astonishing Samuel L. Jackson. I know what your thinking. How in the hell can Jackson, whose playing a villain with a bad and wholly unnecessary lisp, offer any bravado and vigour to a role that is more comical than anything? My answer to you, is that you just watch the film and see for yourself. In addition to being one of the best aspect of Kingsman along with his highly inventive and wholly contemporary scheme to rid the virus known as mankind, Valentine, as well as the film itself, is a highly meticulous and thought-out tongue and cheek ode to the many iconic and memorable films and film villains of the early 70's and 80's. One of the best dialogues in the film, when Valentine and Hart meet for the first time, and indulge in some fine, wholly signature American cuisine, the two discuss, each of their displeased thoughts with the current state of spy, action movies. 'A spy movie is only as good as its villain', says Valentine, in which Hart agrees formidable. I can only imagine how big of a grin screenwriters Jane Goldman and Vaughn himself had penning the script to this film with that notion in mind.",10,4,13,2 March 2015
Her," Review: her/ Night Film Reviews www.nightfilmreviews.com
","From the moment the screen fills with light, and we come face-to-face with Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), his eyes are desolate while his voice is filled with love as he recites the poetically romantic words of Loretta's letter to her husband of fifty years, Chris. Theodore works for BeautifullyHandwrittenLetters.com, a company established sometime in the near future where people are either too lazy or just mentally incapable of writing their own letters to their loved ones. The irony of her begins (as do so many other films) with someone else's love story. The trials and tribulations of Theodore's love story not only mirrors the love we share with others but also portrays our uncontrollable and inexplicable dependence or 'love' for technology. In that sense, her becomes part science fiction love story/part docudrama, with a message that is both a parable of the direction human behaviour is headed and a misunderstood, timeless love story for the ages. Either way, her is the most captivating and responsive film of the year, demanding attention with a grueling look at our ability to love and be loved.her is a cinematic masterpiece for a new generation of technologically burdened individuals. From the moment our two-star crossed lovers meet, we are transfixed, as they are. From the moment I laid eyes on it, I had fallen in love. Being a believer of love at first sight, or in this instance, love at first sound, her has been a film that has left quite an impression on me and has given me so much to think and talk about.This is a peculiarly self-conscious film with themes that are both fantastically impossible yet completely plausible. Essentially, Theo falls in love with the new operating system that is found on his mobile device. The operating system, created by a company called Element Software (substituting for Apple), have crafted the first ever artificially intelligent operating system. Unfortunately for Theo, once he hears the voice of his new OS (operating system), the chump never stood a chance. As the spirals swirl on his computer screen and his personalized operating system is initialized, a voice begins, 'Hello I'm here' and from that moment on, we empathize with Theodore and his ability to fall in love with a voice that is full bodied, raspy and alluring, yet empty; in the same way technology has the ability to be both fascinating and enthralling, yet unfulfilling. The Siri-like persona is voiced by Scarlett Johansson. Originally, the voice of Samantha in Spike Jonze's film was going to be voiced by Samantha Morton (hence why the name Samantha stuck and served as a tribute to the original talented actress), but Jonze opted for a more recognizable voice whose image off-screen is as seductive as when she is on screen. Johansson nails every subtle nuance in her voice-work and offers a career best performance as Samantha. Her ability to express not only the deep desire she has for a physical form but also her unexplainable love for life, learning, and Theodore, will hopefully land Johansson a spot in the history books as the first ever nominee in the Supporting Actress category without ever actually appearing on-screen. Let's just hope the Academy recognizes this high-point in the medium as well.The world according to Jonze looks to be one filled with humanized androids, a world where people endlessly look down at their smartphones,and are never more than an arms reach from any of their devices, and his vision very much resembles the world we live in today. The people in his world are easy to relate to especially with the very possible realization that that is what our growing technological wonderland may actually look like in the not-so-distant future. Jonze takes a very literal interpretation of 'falling in love with your smartphone' as portrayed in his very heavy-handed love story. Contrary to skeptics, Jonze triumphs in his ability to script a world where anything is possible. Jonze's tale of people falling in love with technology is not actually a far stretch from our current Westernized mentality, where people are literally attached and completely dependent on the little devices that organize our lives, our schedules, our thoughts and evades all new and old experiences.One of the most notable and obvious aspects of the world Jonze crafts is how easily everyone is able to be connected, yet how alone and how the character of isolation plays on the interactions between people and their relationships with one another. Ironically enough, her succeeds in all its glory when it magnifies the reclusiveness in which many of the people in the film seem to share. Lacking any real human interactions and genuine human emotions, the film highlights the awkwardness between Theo and many of the people around him; most notably in scenes involving a blind date with quite a gorgeous woman (Olivia Wilde), as well as a very hysterical chat room scene. Theo is constantly longing affection and companionship following his grueling divorce, and it is in the scenes where he voices this longing and his attraction to Samantha that his love and passion is thoroughly and visually understood.Check out the rest of the review at www.nightfilmreviews.com",10,3,6,2 January 2014
Warcraft," Film Review: Warcraft
","OK, first and foremost, I will begin this review by saying that I am not, and never have been a Warcraft player of any sort; meaning, I have not touched the online game, board game, card game or any Warcraft product since its inception. So, going into Duncan Jones' third directorial feature film Warcraft, I was a complete outsider amongst an army of loyal and very aware Warcraft users. Unlike most built-in audiences, each and every person who was in attendance of the early screening, possessed none of the typical geeky, fan-boy characteristics I have come to expect from franchises such as Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Lord of the Rings film franchises. So, how did I feel finally being an outsider and what exactly did the audience I attended the screening looked like?The thing with the Warcraft universe is that everyone at some point tried it and you would never know who is a Warcraft fiend. Young, old, men, women, Warcraft is the type of obsession that could be just about for anyone. So, while I am somewhat aware of the massive universe Duncan Jones was responsible for bringing to life on the big screen, I had no idea how expansive and detailed this world really is.Upon the opening frames, seeing humans battle off against Orcs, and beginning much of the story in a fantastical world of Azeroth, I was one of few audiences members who was just along for the ride, and not for the love of the universe, but for the love of cinema. Having been late to the party with Lord of the Rings (truth of the matter is, I have never seen any of them nor have any interest to), one of the biggest complaints with many of my friends now with Middle Earth is, thanks to the massive success of HBO's Game of Thrones, violence, sex and exponential gore is what audiences want with fantasy films. The action solely isn't enough anymore. And while Daenerys Targaryen actress Emilia Clarke's newest film Me Before You, a romantic drama was playing in the cinema beside mine, I couldn't help but laugh at the fact that, fantasy doesn't always sell anymore; but sex surely does. As I can assure you, I may have never seen an episode of Game of Thrones, but you can sure as heck bet I have seen pictures on the interest of Clarke's bodacious naked bod.With Warcraft, the premise is simple. Orcs, lead by a sadistic leader who possesses the fel, Gul'Dan (Daniel Wu), sucks the life out of other world's inhabitants and uses their energy to open up a portal to a new world, inhabited by human, called Azeroth. To the dismay of Durotan (Toby Kimmell) an his pregnant wife Draka (Anna Galvin), they follow along with Gul'Dan's plans only in hope of finding a peaceful life in the new world. Once through the portal, Gul'Dan wages war against the humans who inhabit that kingdom, putting him in a direct collision course with King of Stromwind Llane Wrynn (Dominic Cooper), and as well as his trusty and noble military commander Sir Anduin Lothar (Travis Fimmel). A fierce warrior and destructive orc killer, Anduin finds himself partnered with the fumbling Khadgar (Ben Schnetzer), a young and inexperienced warlock whose powers have yet to be contained. Advised by the council due to the recent threat of the orcs, Anduin and Khadgar head to Karazhan to summon the Guradian Medivh (Ben Foster) and use his wisdom and powers to help defeat the army of orcs and Gul'Dan once and for all.Fantasy isn't my preferred genre of cinema to watch. Being able to capture these films on the big screen is something wonderful though, especially amongst all its loyal and faithful fans. While the world of the Warcraft universe is highly new and almost unheard of to me, I can honestly say that I was very intimidated by its great reach and length, along with its history. After all, the first ever sighting of the Warcraft real-time strategy game came in 1994, when I was only a child. Imagine how much the world has grown since then? Like anything fanatical and with such a rich history, the more you know, the better. Was I a fan of the film as a whole by the time I left the theatre? Maybe not the biggest, but, does that suggest it was a bad film overall?I believe that audience members, especially ones for this fantastical, built-in audience, is important to consider, especially given the universe's endless possibilities. But, what is the difference between a built in universe such as Warcraft, or, say, the cinematic universe of Marvel or DC? Comic book characters that have been around decades and whose worlds mix, blend and cross- over to other universes regularly? Nothing really. So with that said, as a whole, was Warcraft an amazing fantasy experience? Absolutely not. At times, the film suffers from straining and overwhelming special effects, especially during its action sequences, its action is brute and forceful, giving audiences a bit of a spectacle overload. Where does the film succeed most? In its glory and beauty of showing off the orcs by the firelight, in the dark or marvelling at the great narrative scenes of honour and glory, especially when the camera gazes against the massive arms and shoulders of its main orc protagonist Durotan.",6,0,1,23 August 2016
