Angels & Demons," Not for Atheists
","After reading the book I was looking forward to watch a movie that did not preach 'praise the lord' to me, which Hollywood movies usually do. Well, this movie (too) preached 'praise the lord' to me. Normally I just ignore it, but this move was supposed to be based on a book with a quite different message.I got my first bad feeling when the scientists at Cern where portrayed as careless, clueless, risk-taking, irresponsible children. I thought, hey wait... this is completely opposite to what the book is all about. And it got worse. Much worse. Langdon suddenly is a believer (deep down inside... yeah right), and the only bad thing the church ever did was mutilate statues and kill four suspicious scientists some hundred years ago; everything else is skipped, and replaced with religious moral speech!! The mixed emotions you get in the book are replaced with carefully labeled good guys and bad guys.Yes, it disappointed me!Besides from that, it is a good action movie. Not super great, but absolutely not bad in any way. The plot turns about the same way as in the book, and it is all very exciting and high-paced. I could watch it again if I had nothing better to do, but that's it.",5,0,3,21 May 2009
Life of Pi," Visually marvelous (especially in 3D), but story could have been told better
","The story was a bit slow, but I never felt like leaving the theater, because it was also entertaining in a crazy-beautiful way, and even more beautiful was the visual effects.I did not get the ending at first, and so I was not very impressed. I was even a bit put off. But the movie stayed with me, and as it sunk in I gradually began to understand and appreciate what it was all about. I later looked up the 'explanation' to the original story from the book on the Internet, and I must say the movie is lacking, and makes it quite difficult to understand. This is sad. I think the intended message is worthwhile.",7,0,1,12 January 2013
