The Equalizer," A Highly Recommended suspense Action Thriller
","This is not my favourite film of the year but it is certainly one of the most enjoyable in terms of the action thrills and suspense. Comparisons with Matt Damon in the Jason Bourne movies are for me way off the mark.I have never watched the 'Equalizer TV series' and Denzel Washingtons acting in this movie must rank as some of the coolest I have seen in a while which makes all the film appealing.This film has a gripping story and will you watching until the end. No romance in the story unless McCalls association with the girl was considered in some way romantic. I didn't.I love to hate Russians anyway for the way the gangster-manner they are portrayed in the film full of arrogance and disregard for Society. the story bolts together nicely but the shoot-out towards the end of the film was the one negative for me (rather than the false Russian accents throughout) as that was not in keeping with the nature of the film. it lacked subtlety and Mr McCall deserved more respect in bringing terminus to proceedings.I would like to see a film on the back story on what led to Mr McCalls quiet and secretative life portrayed in the film, it would be quite a pre-quel.",8,0,4,26 December 2014
The Young Victoria," Excellent History Period Movie
","I have watched this movie on DVD a couple of times now,the first time, I watched the second half after the hour and then went back to the first hour. an engrossing entertaining film, thank god no kiera knightley in it, refreshing and it gives us all a genuine insight into the difficult life of Queen Victoria and the difficult choices she had to make. Nothing bad about the movie at all, no real bad language or anything of a sexual nature which would offend for family viewing. Might prompt the kids to research a little about the queen victoria herself and perhaps lesser known characters such as Conroy and Lord Melbourne",7,2,4,7 December 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino movie better than expected
","I had put off this movie for quite awhile until finally pulling the DVD out of the drawer last night. I am no fan of QT but this film is definitely OK in my book, alsobeit the head scalping is a bit over the top for sure, especially when Aldo (Brad Pitt) demands not less than a 100 nazi scalps from each of his men. The film is a mockery but an entertaining one and Brad Pitt carries on where he left off with his cheek and nonchalence in 'Burn after Reading'. a very similar role but with a completely different story. Must agree with earlier comments that the guy playing the German Hans Lander (Waltz) is splendid. Agree also there is too much table talk but that is the essence of this film so lets not knock it. Waltz might make it for Oscar but nobody else will make contention, as enjoyable as the film is. There must have been some point 39-45 when the German leaders were gathered together but not as wittingly portrayed in this movie and in Paris.",7,2,7,7 December 2009
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," entertaining enough and well acted for a PC game enactment
","this was another Sunday afternoon treat for myself and my now '12 year old son. he loved it and thought it was better than clash of the titans, robin hood and iron man 2. i agree its better than iron man 21 but not better than the other two i mention. it is an entertaining movie, there is no doubt, there is good acting with a basic poor script and i have no idea at all about computer PC games but never mind that.there is a strong moral reference in the movie to the search for weapons which didn't exist, something which happened of course with the UN failure to find nuclear weapons in Iraq which led to the Iraq war. is there really a connection or do i exaggerate it.yes the cast was mainly English and with a notable absence of anyone of Arab extraction, so was that also intentional. Ben Kingsley was superb and for the first time like other veterans such as richardgere and Stallone, beginning to show his age with modified agility in some of the sequences.i did enjoy this movie though i am sure i will enjoy pirates 4 much more.",6,2,5,6 June 2010
Orphan," excellent horror movie
","I don't watch many horror movies but this has the wow factor written all over it and must be seen, though certainly evening time and without the kids around, for sure you will be talking and screaming back to your TV screen/DVD player like an idiot but what the hell! this is a modern horror film with a good story, a solid script, the acting is first class and there are more than a few twists. Films like Halloween and Blairwitch just not in the same league. The film never fails to grip you, though its a little slow at the beginning. the moment our lead character Esther enters the character its take off time. Up to then, you will have been wondering what was the reason for the title of the film. see this in the cinema and everyones screaming, pop corn goes everywhere and your drink spills, whoops!",8,2,3,13 December 2009
Shutter Island," No Hitchcock horror but a brilliant chiller thriller from Scorcese!
","I watched this in the cinema on a Friday night and expected a horror film because it was hyped as a horror film. Make no mistake, this is a chilling psychological thriller and I can quite see why Scorcese likes to work with Leonardo (from 'The Departed') and with Robert Richardson from the cinematography for 'Inglorious Basterds'.As others have commented, Scorcese has borrowed (but not stolen) from Hitchcock suspense movies and the scary flashbacks remind us of the recent 'Inglorious Basterds' and at times 'Cape Fear'.There is nothing to laugh or cry about in this movie and there are no really gory scenes, though some scenes (as in Pans Labrynth) I question whether I can expose my 11 year old Son to see.This is a challenging and intelligent movie although for the first 40 minutes or so, I do wonder if I am watching a comedy as Leonardo as (Teddy) spars with Ben Kingsley (as Dr Cawley) in the 'why am I really here?' stakes.The film also reminded me 'a touch' of Michael Douglas in'The Game' where you are never sure what is reality and fantasy. As a movie goer, we have the right to expect the unexpected and we got it for sure in this movie.I am not a Scorcese fan and as much as I like the movie overall, I understand why it is not suitable for Oscar nomination.I like the ending of the movie personally and I have never read the book. Hands up who has read every book for every movie out at the moment? The final scene between Leonardo (as Teddy) and his Partner Chuck linked with the opening scene on the boat perhaps tells the story we want to know while puzzling throughout on everything which happens in between.Yes definitely see this movie but no need to take the tissues for this one or hide behind any bedsheets if watching on DVD. Absorbing, interesting and one to reflect upon afterwards.",8,43,80,28 March 2010
Salt," Very enjoyable and Jolie Action thriller
","This film will surely not disappoint anyone who likes action thrillers with lots of espionage and escapism. It is comparable to the Jason Bourne movies but is entertaining from beginning till end. Angelina Jolie is perfect for the role and there's no bad language, no sexuality to spoil it for younger viewers.Not meant to be a serious or realistic film but this is a film for entertainment and it meets the Bill for sure! The escapes and the car chases are top class and I don't normally go for movies of this kind. The end of the movie is not conclusive, so it keeps us guessing .....Just enjoy and take a breather from the more heavier stuff around at the moment like Shelter and Inception.",7,3,7,12 August 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Thumbs Up Swedish over the American!
","I watched Daniel Craigs American version last night and I watched the Swedish version again this afternoon after first watching it a month ago. I felt it necessary to make a reasonable comparison between thew two movies. I have not read the book.A month ago I also watched 'Dream House' in which Daniel Craig also had a somewhat bizarre but nonetheless starring role. I felt his acting delivery was on a par with that and not with his performances as James Bond or Doctor Who. That is not, however, to mock it.This film in both versions is, of course, about a girl with a dragon tattoo and its meaning to her in her life. In the Swedish version, Lisbeth is more of a loner, intense, unemotional and single-minded in her purpose, whereas in the American version, she is portrayed as somewhat collusions and even romantic.She is a young woman who has suffered a lot in her young life and yet fights on. She is gravely misrepresented but she is strong and takes on super heroine status. She does not like men for a reason, so I do question her intimacy with Michel in David Finchers American version.The beginning and end of the David Fincher movie are not in the Swedish version and thankfully so, though that is not to mock those stories as ridiculous; they are not. I just feel that they were not necessary to tell the story and should have been substance for another movie about this amazing young lady.Daniel Craig is much too cool for my liking in his role as an investigator and what he has to investigate. there is much more purpose and intent with Michael Nyqvist.There is apparent nudity in both movies of Noomi Rapace and Rooney Mara, especially in the lesbian scenes and anal sex scene. Though I like David Finchers films generally, I do think he has missed an opportunity.Surely this total story is about a vengeful young woman against a backdrop to human trafficking of young women (called meaningless whores in both movies as I now recall)administered by a bunch of crazy family members who were also paedophiles with their own children somewhat in remote Sweden.The two main stories in the Swedish film of us trying to understand Lisbeths life and why she is being pursued while a group of investigators work together on a significant news story about human trafficking.It is also important to say that Lisbeth is a brilliant computer hacker and her hacking skills work well with her investigative abilities.As with Hollywood always, whether David Fincher intended it or not, they 'overkill' the storyline and spoil the curious association which existed between Lisbeth and Michel into something that it was not.Despite all that, the American version is still an excellent film but it is just that I personally think, produced on a smaller budget, the Swedish version with its more subtle acting, is a whole lot more superior.if Rooney Mara gets an Oscar for best actress (I think Glenn Close will win for Albert Nobbs)then she should share it with Noomi Rapace.I remain mystified why it was considered appropriate to make two different version of pretty much the same story with a few add on and changes here and there.The first hour is a bit sluggish and there is little, if any, no action, an awful lot of plain dialogue.Go and enjoy the movie however because there is a lot to enjoy - but make sure you see the Swedish version as well - with subtitles!",8,3,7,4 February 2012
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Thriller War Mlovie that never Was but be Goat-ed and Watch It!
","This is a very subtle comedy/drama and I had to watch it a couple of times to get the hang of it and make my mind up. the 'goats' thing is explained halfway through the movie and the film is generally a send-up of American forces being utilized overseas and particularly Iraq. Clooney is head and shoulders above everybody else in this film, I am sorry, Ewan McGregor doesn't deliver here and kevin spacey only has a light role to play.Is it true that the US Army use goats for secret testing and instead of dogs or monkeys? it was actually another film about redemption and exploring 'creative solutions to the war on terrorism'.its funny but you can see Clooneys character from Burn after Reading in this and ironically get the drift also of how Brad Pitt transferred the humour from the same movie to Inglorious Basterds, a sort of film triangle.there were some very clever spoken lines in this movie and overall the film entertains, the breakfast poisoning of the water and eggs was very funny.the Jedai Warriors was added for fun in the same way that Brad Pitts men in Inglorious Basterds were similarly titled for their warfare success by reputation.the story of the film is not great (is there one really?) but it doesn't matter. Wont win any major awards but you will surely like the movie.Didn't really get the connection of showing Clooney potentially with cancer and what was 'the Denmark' thing? enjoy and await the call of the US Army if you are a broken hearted journalist or a psychic or a New Age Army guy ready to enrol!",7,1,2,30 December 2009
Inside Out," An excellent and funny Pixar animation movie
","I am surprised so many people have reviewed this film with such negativity. As a mature individual well plus 21, I watched this movie with my wife and youngest child who is aged four. We all laughed all the way through.Sometimes, I wonder what people expect from a movie. Here we have an imaginative story line which truly gets into the mind of a young child with joy sadness fear anger and disgust.Yes, the characters for Mother and Father are a little stereotyped and there are moments in the film when you could easily feel disappointed or depressed but those moments are short and overall the film holds the attention of the audience from beginning to end.The storyline is simplistic and touching, nothing overly American about it, dealing with a child moving far away from home and looking at the problems she faces at home and at school in a fun and challenging way.This is no doubt a film aimed at a mixed audience of parent and child and teenagers too might find the topic of interest when looking at those five basic emotions applied to themselves.There are a lot of mediocre films about which fall well below the mark and not many in the category of family entertainment which are appealing across the generation divide. In my view, this one will appeal.It was the weekend, the film was recommended to me. It was a perfectly good moral film with a sound storyline and easy to follow. I did not have to think too much on any of the issues raised in the film. Younger children would not grasp the point made in the morality stakes but who cares so long as everyone who goes to see the film can eat their popcorn in safety and have a few laughs? Well, nearly everyone!",8,19,54,13 September 2015
District 9," Science Fiction Alien Spaceship romp!
","It is difficult to mock this film and not to enjoy it given its high commendation on this website and its Oscar nomination for best picture. I am no fan of science fiction over drama or thrillers or romance but this is an entertaining and original film which should undoubtedly be seen.It is the last of the Oscar best picture nominations for 2010 for me to see and I think the one with the least chance. It clearly will have a cult following with people of all sectors of society.I wonder whether Peter Jackson was called upon for his experience in character creation with Lord of the Rings series, that is a semblance of connection for me.overall it is a harsh story line and I feel the aliens are not treated sympathetically, given they are a unique species. Fencing them in and letting them live in slum conditions was surely a throwback to Soweto and Apartheid, but who am I to be correct about that? The film is more of a documentary than a conventional movie but don't be put off by that. I agree with earlier comments that this is a very realistic storyline and we can all apply our intelligence to think that something like this COULD happen but surely the rest of the world would not stand by idle and allow a country like South Africa.The MNU were clearly integral to the story and their quest for weapon control than alien-welfare was an underlying factor.sorry folks, I was much more comfortable with NINE and STAR TREK, does Blomkamp really want us to think the aliens are coming? It is World Cup year of course!",7,0,3,19 February 2010
Gone Girl," Contrived Comedy with no Laughs but a Lot of Fun to watch
","This is a terrific film to watch with lots of twists and turns, suspense and drama and you will remain intrigued and interested from beginning until the end. One thing is for sure. If you are one of the many men in the world who for whatever reason have assets (or credit cards) retained in the name of a spouse/partner, you might want to think twice after watching this film and ask yourself some very serious (or silly/stupid0 questions about what would happen if ...This for me was not a black comedy, it was far from dour but it was a comedy on a number of very serious issues. I did not laugh at any of the comic moments (and there were many throughout) but it raised a few eyebrows and certainly drew a smile.Suspect that nobody will win any Oscar awards but nominations will be justified. A little bit like 'Prisoners', this was a film where the ending could certainly have been left a lot more open ended and left up to the audience to decide what happened to the husband and wife.I called it a contrived comedy because I felt the ending was very much tailored rather than one which was in keeping with the pace and mystique of the film. Not sure if that was the fault of the script, screenplay or the directing by David Fincher.Splendid film. Of course there is a lot about the film which is absurd but watch the film to enjoy rather than to tear it apart.",7,0,4,1 January 2015
2012," Entertaining blockbuster with great special effects
","yes, its the film everybody wants to see and will see but its bound to disappoint if you are expecting a realistic interpretation of the mayan forecast for the end of the world in 2012. ready made for john cusack to play the family hero again, definitely overacted and very poor script indeed but the story does move along (literally) and we see parts of the North or South Pole in Wisconsin. the film did entertain and I am not disappointed because I saw what i expected - a combo of titanic, poseidon adventure, war of the worlds and day after tomorrow. Forget the rest of the world, just worry about America, nowhere else matters. the Noahs Ark thing was one of the best parts of the movie but I don't think it was explained enough as part of the story. Not in the same league as titanic or poseidon adventure but you will leave the cinema for sure with an adrenalin rush!",7,1,2,13 December 2009
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Im a Film Enthusiast, Get me Out of Here Please
","I am sorry to say that this was one of the worst films I have seen this year. If I had watched it on DVD instead the cinema, I would have switched off after five minutes. It is a very boring film indeed with very little continuity, though got to say that my 11 year old son loved it and he is reading the books. My guess is if you like High School Musical 3 and 17 Again, you will probably like this also. When people fidget with their handfones after only a few minutes, it is a sure sign. the love triangle of the human girl, vampire and werewolf is a curious one and I hope they explore that more in Twilight 3 rather than concentrate on Twilight 3 the Love Story. Many of the previous sentiments I echo. Bella as a young woman, should be portrayed as someone wanting to live and to represent moral and social values, not give herself to the afterlife with a vampire or a werewolf. Change of director, change of setting I think also needed, get the story back out of American hands and give it to the French who really know how to make a movie like this. I did like the scene in the town (French?) when all the townspeople were dressed up in red at midday and it helped to give meaning to the opening scene of the film but to contradict myself, the scene was an expensive overstatement to the film which is after all set in America not in Europe. The Jake actor has real potential but sorry Edward Cullen, you don't cut it for me",4,5,8,12 December 2009
Clash of the Titans," Entertaining enough but not memorable. Slightly disappointing
","This is one of those movies of which I had high expectations as a blockbuster. sorry folks, this is no blockbuster, it is nowhere as good as 300 and the recent Percy Jackson and Lightning Thief scores for me a whole lot better in terms of interpretation of Greeks mythology.Sam Worthington as Perseus is likable but thats about it. He is no Sean Bean and doesn't deliver a strong enough character performance for me for a 'demi God' and the women throughout are models rather than actresses delivering good lines.The opening boat scene is intriguing enough but the first let down is seeing the haircut of Perseus on the beach as a child, trying to connect where he was and what he was doing, it didn't wash for me. His taking to the Argos King and Queen and the confrontation inside the Palace was bizarre.I agree with comments about the Krakken and the Medusa, they could have made more of Medusa and exploited more the real myth of Perseus and Medusa. My 11 year old son liked the film and things like Zeus giving Perseus the coin to enter the Hades underworld (same as in Percy Jackson) was interesting.I don't say the film wasn't interesting or entertaining and there were some great scenes but I didn't go to see a mix of King Kong meets Lord of the Rings. Too much wizardry for me and the logic of Greek mythology became lost. Too many corny lines, poor lines, too much emphasis on the action without really connecting it to the story.Certainly not a film to see in 3D.",6,2,3,11 April 2010
Paranormal Activity," worst 'horror' movie of the year 2009
","sorry folks, I struggled to finish watching this awful film, the acting by the young couple is third rate at best and overdone, very pretentious indeed. the special effects are non-existent, the script is dire and if it wasn't for the appearance of the psychic a couple of times (the only bit of real acting in the whole episode), no way would you call this a film. It is a shame because like Blair Witch project and Cloverfield, there was actually an opportunity to create something original which would be truly remembered, that opportunity was wasted. Again, another piece of americanism which is the real spoiler. The guy is supposed to be a day trader, so we assume he has brains - when did he ever use them in the movie? did the film really ever explain why this 'thing' was following the girl (Katy) from house to house? Where were their computers, mobile phones, other electronic equipment? The focus was on deliberate intent of creating an abnormal lifestyle for two apparently normal people in order to create in turn abnormality (or paranormal activity). what paranormal activity? I didn't see any during the film at all, it would have been better as a Mel Brooks spoof! First hour was absolute rubbish and the 'recording' (because cant really call this a film) offered some substance of scary moments which caught our attention until the final ending about which I will say nothing. Saw this on DVD, I certainly wouldn't bother watching it in a cinema and if you did, shame on you when you have a wide choice at your local multiplex. Horror for me is like Orphan which makes you watch all the way through and react; my only reactions to this were to nearly turn it off at the hour mark - And to fall asleep just before the end. Only survived to the ending because I wanted to write this report. Every one of us is capable of making a movie like this infinitely better. Katy and her partner were a couple of 'stiffs', there was no true emotional sense between except at the beginning when he greets her on her arrival out of the car. I hear they are making a P A 2012 - is it a doomsday scenario or some sort of screenplay/directors worst nightmare contest/competition? If Mr Spielberg did watch some of this and walk out, thank God for common sense!",4,1,2,20 December 2009
Everest," An amazing and gripping edge of your seat real Life Drama
","Like everyone else, I had waited many months for this film to come out and I was not disappointed when I got my chance to watch it this afternoon with my wife and four year old Son. Yes, I took him along too and he loved the helicopter scene towards the end but the sound effects were a little bit too loud and overpowering at times (for him at least).I am hugely interested in the story of Everest ascent from an educational and scientific standpoint. I am no mountaineer or climber and I am in total awe of anyone who attempts such a challenge.The film successfully tells the story of what happened to the eight people who died on the mountain in this 1996 tragedy. I agree with many of the other posters about the negatives. Sherpas are very much a part of the Everest story and they are hardly featured. Also the heights relative to getting to Everest did not seem relative to the 'Mother of the Sky' but maybe that was impossible to achieve.Criticism has been directed at one or two of the actresses, notably Keira Knightley. She had very much a supporting role and overall she acted well. It seems unjust to criticise for the role she played.I also got confused with many of the characters as the guys all had bushy beards, were of course heavily clothed and it was not easy to know who was who.They tried to address in group discussion as to why people like these mountaineers are motivated to climb Everest and I think this was very relevant indeed.No doubt all the filming was done prior to the Nepal earthquake in April 2015. Do we know if the original Everest Base Camp site was used for the movie? Not sure it is relevant yes or no.The first half an hour was an excellent starter for the main story to come on the mountain itself.Two hours of afternoon entertainment, though of course, it is a story of heroes and villains in a sense because I have to wonder whether an actual weather forecast was communicated to the climbers at any appropriate time which might have changed some of the decisions made and averted many if not all of the dangers, given the severity of the blizzard which, according to the story in the film, struck at least twice.Tremendously well directed, the cinema effects of the films were simply stunning and the actors clearly put great endeavour into their character portrayal.",9,2,5,24 September 2015
Alice in Wonderland," A wonderful positive feel good family film
","this is a wonderful film to watch in the mould of 'Enchanted. In that film, the Princess goes from the fantasy world to the real world but in this movie the opposite happens and Alice goes from reality to fantasy. Not familiar with the leading actress as Alice, never heard of her before but wow for Johnny Depp as the Mad Hatter just like his roles in Edward Scissorhands, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, Dr Parnissus and of course Sweeney Todd. That brings me to the fine acting chemistry Depp has with Helena Bonham Carter who the Red !Queen. This is not a sequel but an adaptation of one persons interpretation of the main story with a few variations to make the film more interesting and to give characters greater depth, particularly Mad Hatter and the Chesire Cat. Great voice overs by the likes of Timothy Spall Barbara Windsor and Stephen Fry.This is essentially an English film through and through. No American accents thank the Lord, Depp puts on a fabulous Scottish accent thanks to R C Nesbit. Its a foreign fairytale with lots of morals and although I call it a family film, its not really a kids film like Enchanted was and obviously because its half and half real life and animation, Disney preferred to promote Up first for Oscar 2010 nomination.The chess board battle scene towards the end of the film was a wonderful Burton gimmick with the Queen the Knight and the creation of the Jabberwicky character.Its not an emotional film, wont make you laugh or cry much but it will keep you interested throughout. Very entertaining, some nice dialogues and great interactions between the main characters. Mad Hatter definitely steals the show for me as soon as I first came on the set and worst point I must agree with earlier comment to be the overuse of the White Queens fingernails! Not quite a must see film but if you love Alice in Wonderland and the characters, you will surely like this movie.",8,3,5,21 March 2010
Avatar," Not a blockbuster but a unique entertaining 3D Film. Forget American Propaganda!
","Not a family film in my opinion and released at a time when families are tempted to go and see it together as a family. I saw it in a 3D cinema. Too long for 3D entertainment quite honestly, hurts the ears eyes and neck and you are straining to enjoy the spectacle even in a comfortable theatre seat. After the first 30 minutes, the novelty of the 3D effect wears off and tempted to take off the 3D glasses.I agree the film is sensational with special effects and I love the story per se of the Navi people - but not the story of the film itself? why should everything have to be about America doing this, America doing that? why an American marine? why all that early film reterick from the Colonel? Why did it have to be Jake, though I understand what happened to his twin brother in the story.Sorry, S. Weaver is a terrific actress but she is out of place and over-aged in this movie, she does work well with james cameron but not here. Makes me sad that Cameron seems to have concentrated on getting a message across concentrating on violence and that America can more or less take what it wants from whoever it wants, whenever it wants.Ironically I saw The Box earlier in the day which also delivered an insinuative point raising a moral dilemma. The story of the film is extremely weak and more time should have been spent nurturing it and clarifying the characters. Many young and old will watch the movie and not understand it at all, especially those in foreign countries, who have no knowledge of the American invasion of Vietnam for example.Alien and Terminator are superior Cameron films and this film will only be remembered for the 3D visual effects, not for any acting. it is not a bad film. Cameron is a pro and where nudity was apparent, it was discreet and there was no real bad language throughout.Reminded me a bit of Braveheart and the William Wallace Scotland v England (we will get our way whatever) and a touch of Jurassic Park with the forest creatures. If Weavers character was meant to be prominent, she certainly had no lines in the movie to demonstrate her vast talent or to show why scientists were there at all in the conflict.Bless the guy who played Jake, he carries the film completely (should have played the vampire in New Moon as Edward) and he clearly has acting talent. I hope no Oscars for this film because its pure American propaganda, no acting performance deserves to be nominated but consider it for special effects and visuals, that alone but not beyond.Enjoy the film for what it is and perhaps don't take it too seriously. I get tired of films like this which depict America as a vindictive nation out to grab grab grab - the importance of the mineral the Americans were after was never fully explained - so the story itself was biased and overladen in favour of violence rather than alternatives.Too long for 3D and not a family film, too many nauseating moments for young kids.",8,1,3,23 December 2009
Invictus," Outstanding Film, High Standard entertainment, Clint Scores a try Here!
","this for me is clint eastwoods best ever film as director. this film is a real winner, great performance by Morgan Freeman as mandela and indeed by matt Damon as Francois Pinaar the South African Rugby captain. This is a classier version of another sporting movie I saw a year or so ago (Goal II) which deserved something but got nothing. There is so much about this film that you will enjoy and you don't have to be a Rugby fan to enjoy it (or to understand the rules of Rugby because they are explained for you (and mandela) briefly in the movie.I am the master of my fate, I am the captain of my soul.I have seen this movie shortly after seeing (End Game) (about how mandela was catapulted into power)and The Blind Side (which has nothing to do with this movie at all except it deals with blacks and whites in sport and has a sporting theme re American football).The PLAYERS trip to mandelas cell on the eve of the big match and the plane flying over the stadium are great moments and even the little quieter moments of the coloured maid in the Pinaar family household was dramatic and well handled.There was nothing bad in this movie, lots of predictability but those who knew the result of the 1995 Final wont be in any way disappointed. We all love Lomu, even the English. The mixing of the real and alternative action smacked of Goal II, hence my reference to that and Eastwood must have got his ideas from that film to use the filming and the commentaries etc.I lost the film a bit on the new South African anthem which the players rejected to sing and I certainly would have liked to have seen scenes of how patriotic the players really were in the build up to the matches, especially the final. what we saw and focused on was mandela greeting the players.Clearly, as mandela was used in 'End Game', mandela himself was using the World Cup and Pinaar as a political vehicle to unite his country and sport. If there was a weakness, it was that pinaars character was not researched enough and was too shallow and perhaps Freeman overplayed the Mandela intentions, but the film works and it is a wonderful film to watch, even when the credits are coming up, stay till the very end because the very end is as important as the beginning.",9,3,5,30 December 2009
Crazy Heart," Sad and Undramatic Country and Western Singer not worthy of Oscar
","Oh dear, I suspect many will disagree with me but I found this film tedious, barely entertaining (except for the songs and I am not a c/w fan) and glad to end.No problem with the overall acting by all the main contenders which includes Colin Farrell as Tommy who was the real actor in this movie. Jeff Bridges sings well enough but not sure being a pretend alcoholic makes you an actor? Even get you an Oscar nomination.Same feeling about this movie as Up in the Air, no real story, no drama, no dialogue, no really entertaining moment. Tommy and Bad singing a number together reminded me of Walk the Line when Phoenix sang the number with Reese Witherspoon.overall, the film has comparison with Gerard Depardieus performance in The Singer (so much better) and the 'Son problem' with Mickey Rourkes character in The Wrestler, a middle aged American celebrity who has lost his way.Film is certainly for lovers of country and western music, Jeff bridges fans and those who like this American way of looking at life, thank god the rest of the world does not think and behave like this.I couldn't work out the Maggie character. She was introduced to Bad Blake but what is her real motive? Was she a fan? Was she attracted to 'bad' guys? If she was a journalist, who did she work for and what story about Bad Blake was she really writing or intending to write? Where was the father of the child? Where did the boy go when he disappeared from the Bar? If it wins Oscar for best actor, it is because the American market favours characters like the one played by Jeff Bridges. why couldn't they concentrate a balance between Bad Blake and Tommy? Colin Farrell both in this movie and also in the Imaginarium of Dr Parnissus demonstrates that he has acting skills of a wide reaching kind, unlike Jeff Bridges I am sorry to say who seems somewhat stereotyped.Its a sad movie because clearly Bad Blake is a failing musician who wants a better life in his later years but is it too late to find that better life and come off the drink? But not sad enough because the story is not an emotional one and I feel no sympathy for Bad Blake at any time during the movie. I do not believe Maggie (Jeanne) would be so desperate at the end to do what she did.",6,2,4,26 February 2010
Inception," Very disappointing action packed Di Caprio drama
","I had waited to see this movie on a decent copy DVD and missed it at the cinema. It was a very hyped movie on its release and I like De Caprios movies on the whole including the recent Shutter Island which surely does have some psychological connection with this movie in'playing with our minds'. But I liked and followed Shutter Island, I couldn't really follow 'Inception' and as a native Englishman, I am still unsure as to the meaning of the word 'Inception' for the context of the film.The film is only mildly engaging, tries to be intelligent and smart but fails dismally. There is no lack of action but this is 'not' Bourne Supremacy' or 'Salt' and things happened so haphazardly and quickly in the actions scenes that it completely bored the pants off me when watching the movie because I was trying to follow the story of the film and couldn't, so I became frustrated.Leonardo is a great actor and acts well, true enough and I love Ellen Page after Juno and even Peacock - but this film was definitely not for her and Michael Caine had a minor cameo role as Miles the Father figure for Leonardos character. As for Mal played by Marion Couthillard, oh dear, what a shambles! This is one of those films which will be quickly forgotten and barely remembered in Leonardos repertoire. The concept of the film is indeed a good and innovative one and I kept thinking of movies like 'The Matrix' while watching it. Why oh why did the director have to 'overcook' this movie.We watch movies to be entertained. Like Iron Man 2, if you like movies with abundant action and little reality, go ahead, watch this movie and rave about it but for me, it is a major disappointment, not with the mainstream acting and the story but with the end result through directing and production. My feeling is that it was shoddy.Not a movie to review a second time or recommend to friends to see, sorry!",5,5,7,28 October 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Brilliant Crime thriller in victorian London
","What a wonderful movie! How this doesn't win something in the Oscars will be beyond me. Last week I saw Invictus and raved about it but this is marginally better in all quarters and I hedge a bet on Robert Downey for best actors over Morgan Freeman or Gerard Butler (Law Abiding Citizen). Tremendous entertainment which had the whole audience at the cinema laughing and crying with every moment right to the end. Robert Downey did indeed act Holmes to perfection by his own interpretation if not by the Holmes we might have expected from the Conan Doyle novel. Watched it with my 11 year old son who didn't flinch at the scenes when Holmes was displaying his fighting skills but he plays PS2 most days so he has seen it all, got the teeshirt! Great great simple dialogue between Holmes and Watson but I didn't appreciate even just two American actors noticeably appearing in the movie and allowing their presence. the first was the politician guy who died with the gun in his hand and the second was the woman (Mary) giving Holmes grief at the end. Amazing reconstructed scenes of victorian London, even great thought in detail to the street scenes, wow, great stuff! Definitely a movie to watch again on DVD because there is so much to absorb and wonder about the movie. Powerful entertainment! Jude Law for me was highly disguised as Watson and acted well though Downey excelled from his good support in 'Soloist' to surely claim an Oscar for best actor. Is this another British movie getting Oscar credit?",9,0,4,4 January 2010
The Blind Side," Excellent Family Film for the Xmas Season, Go Sandra, Go!
","Another lovely family seen on DVD during the festive season. For a Brit living in south east Asia most of the time, I think a narrative caption explaining to a non-American and non-enthusiast of US football who is lawrence Taylor - would have been appreciated, opening scene of the football match didn't do it for me I am afraid and was the weakest part of the film.I loved this film, similar for me like Juno and yes, it has Oscar potential. Sandra Bullock was average in The proposal and disappointing in All About Steve, this was her at her best and clearly she must have some enthusiasm for US football - but what with this Tennessee/Mississippi thing? Can someone please explain.Big Mike was great. Nice simple story in essence of an affluent American family doing a good turn for a homeless coloured kid; the football element I think was secondary to the social integration which Big Mike was trying to experience at school and in the new family home. Even his real Mum in her short role was a star.Does an American football player really have to have brains to progress his career? God help some of the English soccer players if there was ever such a requirement applied by the British FA! Did wonder what the husband did all day with his work/business to be sop affluent and allow Sandra bullock carte-blanche pretty much on running her family life and other peoples as well. Thought the children characters in the movie were a little stiff and unimpressive but this was really a film vehicle for Sandra bullock to really excel, she dominated this film much more than big Mike.OK, I finally got to understand about The Blind Side as part of the football game but as I said, i thought football was secondary in this films. It was well directed, overall well acted and it is quirky comedy which will make you happy at the cinema or on DVD",7,0,0,26 December 2009
Blow," John Depp 10 years on with Public Enemy Number One
","Well I know this film was release din 2001 and somewhere along the line I missed it as a big Depp man but this is a long and very worthwhile movie to see and I can see how and why Depp was hired for Public Enemies.Yes, it does glorify George Jung in many ways but as the previous commentator says, this is about the ending of the film and there are parts you can skip to get to the final 30 minutes.Good film overall though and Depp in his alternative monster role never lets us down. he is no monster though, just a guy who wants to provide for his family. Sadly the film is spoilt by the overacting of Penelope Cruz who may have a pretty facer and a good body but maybe she should try acting with Steven Siegal in the 'help me to act' Hollywood stakes, she was desperately poor in this movie.In fact the film is quite an eye opener about the drugs trade in the 1970s and about the Colombian Mr Escobar.",7,0,1,22 May 2010
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Mildly entertaining Vampire Drama without Vampires
","This the third in the Twilight movie series I found strangely entertaining but it does not mean it is a good movie. It is ONLY a two hour movie (thank God!) but it was noticeable how many people made toilet trips 'during' the movie. It entertained me because I managed to stay awake for the whole two hours in expectation that something interesting would happen.If I recall from the second movie New Moon, didn't Edward promise to marry Bella at the end of the movie? This latest movie wastes too much time exploring the delinquent emotions of a confused teenage girl called Bella who cant make up her mind whether she wants to spend her life with a vampire called Edward or a werewolf called Jacob, we cant blame her Father for wanting to protect her (he is a police officer after all) and for her Mother wanting to keep a distance (far away in Florida the story would have us believe).The special effects of Jacob in particular as a werewolf is compelling if only for that but let us then remind ourself that this is not 'chronicles of narnia' or indeed 'incredible hulk' and I was particularly amused with the lack of clothing worn by all when they were all up at the top of a snow-capped mountain, gosh it must have been cold mustn't it? The Voltari offered the only real story to the movie and this was not exploited enough in the movie for an adult audience. An opportunity was missed. Clearly within the story there was 'a vampire outbreak' in Seattle and the Voltari were called upon to settle it - but of course the rivalry between the Vampires and the Werewolfs created a decision conflict with the Voltari which focused around Bella as a woman for revenge because Edward had killed the boyfriend of the 'red haired woman) in the first Twilight movie.This was just a movie for teenagers to 'woon and swoon' and not more. I concur that the young lady playing Bella and the guy playing Jacob have limited acting ability. I disagree with the negativity about Robert Pattinson whom I feel gave a genuine acting performance. He has definitely improved and you should compare his performance here with that in the delightful 'Remember Me' where the triangle with a mysterious woman and a father who is law enforcement is relative.Watch it at your peril! Mums and Dads, be prepared with your popcorn and soft drinks and don't miss the 'funny bits' like the snow scene which make this movie even remotely watchable as an adult. Kids, its 'comic entertainment' transferred to the big screen.",6,4,6,31 July 2010
The Social Network," An interesting insight into how Facebook came about
","This movie in my honest opinion is a little too long, its extremely boring at times with the tedium of litigation fought out in a 'boardroom' but nonetheless engrossing, engaging and interesting - and lets face it, who doesn't use Facebook nowadays? Imagine if they made a similar movie about Bill Gates and the creation of Microsoft! It is also interesting to note from here that David Fincher was the Director behind Benjamin Button, Fight Club and Seven, all good movies in their own right. This is also a very good movie, but as others have said, it is just that - good - trying too hard to be great.I have got to say that the main character portrayed for creating Facebook in the movie is extremely annoying throughout. Very obnoxious and offensive and I felt sorry for the two guys who worked with him in the Facebook set up.Justin Timberlake steals the show to some extent as Napsters Sean Parker, impeccable acting, as an actor, he never fails to deliver.I quite believe that the drift of the story in the film is accurate but there are clearly changes to create a drama. If the real lives story are followed, then there should be no drama for us to enjoy and it is the drama which makes the film for me, not the actual telling of the Facebook story which was thrown in for good measure.We can all watch this and think - wow, what if I had thought of that simple concept back in the Autumn of 2003, but then again, would I really want such a life changing experience which would jeopardise my relationship with family and friends.The movie is flawed in a number of basic areas. I assume nobody gets into Harward without some academic and family qualifying criteria but this is never mentioned in the movie, unlikely the twins who are clearly guys from a family with money.More than once, the point is made that the guy has become the youngest billionaire on earth and that he was ruthless in his determination to execute his plan and get Facebook online, to the cost of friends (and perhaps family) connections.With this in mind, as others have said, the film should have objectively explained to us how the Facebook website could come to be so valued by such a high figure after such a short time. Certainly Sean Parker speculated during the movie but this was way short of figures being talked about in litigation.This was a dangerous film to watch in some ways and yet worth watching a second time to 'comb the dialogue' which was constant throughout. Dangerous because we might be wrongly inspired by its message and perhaps even distrusting of the purpose of a social networking site.I always enjoy 'insight' films and I enjoyed this one despite anything I say which may be construed as negative. The opening scene between the guy and the girlfriend was incredibly tedious and could have been considerably shortened but never mind that, maybe that is the screenplay writer trying to score early points for an Oscar nomination.Not an Oscar movie for me but its a very credible movie overall",7,0,1,10 November 2010
The Soloist," Schizo street musician hits the right notes in performance
","A nice movie to watch in my opinion with a terrific acting performance by Jamie Fox as Nathaniel Ayers and Robert Downey supports well as the encouraging journalist. Perhaps someone can enlighten us what the outcome of the movie is/was and what it did achieve for Nathaniels future life but I know its a sensitive true story and Jamie Fox and Robert Downey acted their respective parts perfectly. I agree with earlier comment that there was sometimes too much dwelling and focus on the Downey rather than fox character. The title was after all named for the street musician and not the journalist and in many ways it did pose questions what was the motive for Downey (Lopez) in pursuit of Nathaniels promotion and the story which he ultimately told. As a film per se, it is very good and I personally think Jamie fox is worthy of Oscar nomination for 2010 (though I don't understand how the timing of film release for Oscars works). I am no medic and I am not sure that the film, it it fails, correctly addresses the scrizophenic issue attributed to nathaniels failure to be society-conformist but the film entertains and serves its purpose",7,1,2,21 December 2009
Law Abiding Citizen," Shawshank thriller with a killer punch, wow what a movie!
","Wow, seen many good movies in recent weeks, this one, a little unexpectedly, takes the 'biscuit'. A touch of tim robbins and shawshank redemption in this one, but how different Gerard Butler is in this one from Dear Frankie and another love story thingie I cant remember the name of. first class, give him the Oscar now for best actor, I loved jamie Fox in the Soloist and I liked him in this movie also but Gerard Butler as Claude is absolutely brilliant, you will want to watch this movie from beginning to end, its very climatic though I do agree that the ending is a little on the weak side but the real good guy had to live and poor Clyde had to be out-thought sooner or later. God save the Mayor! Felt a bit sorry for the two criminals at the outset, Darby and Ames, how unlucky to stumble upon the household of such a genius as Clyde Hamilton. this is not my favourite movie but its the best movie for all round things. You cant watch this film and be disappointed, surely not. Chester was a mysterious connection for me, so called boyfriend of the blonde haired assistant. Terrific film, yes it has flaws like the ending but all the best movies do and take the rough with the smooth. Enjoy!",9,0,1,26 December 2009
Up in the Air," Nice Clooney Film but over-acted and over-rated
","I suspect most people will disagree with me but I found this film to be slow and generally boring, there was little acting in it for me and i don't find it a challenging role for George Clooneys acting ability, unlike in Burn after Reading and men who Stare at Goats, even Michael Clayton. As for the directing, not sure what to make of it cos I really liked the Juno movie.I know what its like Tobe e out of work, fired and to fire someone, we can all relate to the role play within this film both from the work standpoint and from the relationship standpoint as well also as the 'flying' standpoint.The title of the film carries a triple meaning - to do with flying too much, to be uncertain about relationships so 'up in the air' and to be up there when you re out of work.The idealology of the film is terrific, I just don't think it delivers and I might go along that Tom Cruise opr even Brad Pitt would have been better suited to the role than dear Mr Clooney who seems to want to grab all these types of roles for himself these days.Will be a travesty if Clooney wins Oscar for best actor. This film is very over-rated, slow to take-off, slow to land, predictable in many ways, not enough punch lines for a dramatic comedy .Even though boring, it IS enjoyable but I enjoyed Cloonety in 'Goats' so much more and Juno was definitely funnier. Maybe this film was aimed at a specific American audience, it just didn't deliver for me, sorry folks.",7,3,5,25 January 2010
