United 93," Moving portrayal of tragic event...
","Every September, I watch at least one movie about 9/11 to remember what happened in 2001. I hesitate to say this is my favorite because, although that is what it is, I wished that this movie wasn't based off a true story. Paul Greengrass does an amazing job of showing the heroism of the passengers and crew who did all they could to stop the hijackers from hitting their intended target. I cannot watch this movie without crying for two reasons - it is based on a real event and the acting is incredible. I really appreciate Greengrass for casting unknown actors so you don't see their celebrity. You appreciate their portrayal for what it is. The ending is especially moving and the music adds to the tragedy. Even if there were no music, it wouldn't be any less powerful. I highly recommend this movie. I like it better than the other movie that was made about United 93 because this one seems less forced and more accurate. It seems the other movie was focused more on adding details that probably did not occur rather than staying true to the story as it was. Greengrass had support from the families of those on board and tried to make this movie as accurate as possible.",10,0,1,2 October 2014
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," Slow and draining
","I really wanted to like this movie as I'd heard such great things about it and read really great reviews but I cannot imagine why it got such high marks. I found the story so slow and couldn't even get past an hour of watching it before I had to turn it off. The scenery is great, I'll give it that, but it's following a middle aged man who works in a failing company trying to track down a freelance photographer to figure out where a missing negative is. But, the guy is a coward and doesn't tell a girl that he likes her. All in all, it reminded me a lot of 'One Hour Photo' that also went very slow. I guess it's not my kind of style of movie.

The Twilight Saga: New Moon," Very depressing and dull
","I am sorry to say that I went to see this movie. I thought the first one was rather interesting, so I read all the books, and thought that the next movies would be rather good as well. I couldn't have been more wrong. Both my mom and I agree that this movie is not suitable for children. It displays a young woman--Bella--falling dangerously in love with a vampire and when he leaves, she becomes depressed to the point of being suicidal. If this were a real person, she would have been committed to a mental institution because she displays the classic symptoms of borderline personality disorder. She shows no interest in friends, family, school, etc. It's not healthy for ANY young person to see this lest they think this is normal behavior.The movie itself was downright dull. The first one had some action and it was worth watching. The actors barely had any lines. If they did, it was stuttering. I think Summit Entertainment did a horrible job with direction when they let Catherine Hardwicke go. At least she could come up with a story line that was more intriguing.My advice? Wait until it comes out on video and rent it from $1 box.",3,8,13,5 December 2009
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Not worth watching
","I was excited when I saw that there would be a movie coming out about my favorite book as a child, but this movie is so different than the book that I was very disappointed. Not only was it different, but it was not even remotely amusing. I ended up turning it off because it was dull. The characters were rather irritating and childish. I felt like no thought or imagination was given to this movie. From first glance, it looked as though it would be good, but the reviews were horrible and it was a major disappointment. I know this may seem harsh, but this movie is trash. About the only thing that was interesting was the cinematography, but even that couldn't keep me watching. I do not recommend.",3,16,38,18 January 2010
Flight," Had to keep watching!
","After many times of trying to watch this movie, I finally managed to watch the whole thing. I'm a Robert Zemeckis fan. I was really hoping this movie would measure up to his past work. It definitely through me for a loop. I was jolted by the crash scene as I found it very intense. I honestly thought that the co-pilot had pressed something that caused the malfunction. When I really learned what happened, I was shocked. This movie, however, is VERY slow in the middle part. It seemed like it took forever to get to the ending. I kept waiting for something to happen and was annoyed. I do like this movie, but it's not a favorite. I thought it was thought-provoking - much like an action thriller should be - but tiresome after a while. I do recommend this movie but beware that you're going to have to be patient!",7,0,0,27 November 2013
