Blade Runner 2049," A near perfect sequel to the original masterpiece
","I'm a huge fan of the original. I'm also a huge fan of Dystopia NF-SciFi. So when a sequel was announced I was both excited but also worried that Hollywood would once again botch a great movie (Yeah I'm looking at you, Star Wars Force Awakens). I have to say Blade Runner 2049 was almost everything I hoped it would be.Bleak, dystopian future. High and low technology intertwined. Soundtrack that pays homage to the original. Wonderful scene-scapes. The storyline was great - thought provoking but not the least bit convoluted. The story also seamlessly continues from the original, even though it could be a stand alone.Yes there were some 'slow' parts in this movie; but these were perfectly fine and IMO added to the overall atmosphere. I really enjoyed soaking up the atmosphere of the movie, it was a visual treat.I do agree with other reviewers that a few scenes could have been cut without harming the movie, but they weren't completely pointless.My only disappointment was I feel there was a missed opportunity for the iconic line 'Time to die', but whatever.Overall I loved this movie, well written and directed. A real treat for dystopia sci-fi and Blade Runner fans.",10,5,15,20 October 2017
