Walk the Line," Excellent film
","If you are a true Johnny Cash fan, you will love this movie. It is a little long but well worth the time. It made me want to go out and buy what little of his music I do not already have. The acting was superb and I was pleasantly surprised that the singing was as good as it was. I thought since the actors did the singing themselves that it would damage the movie, but not at all. I do wish the movie had included more of his later life. It pretty much ended when he and June were married and actually that was just the beginning of his wonderful career. Of course, that would have made for a much longer movie. Maybe this will lead to a follow up and we can learn more about the years after the Carters converted him and not just the part about the drugs and booze.",10,0,0,11 January 2006
