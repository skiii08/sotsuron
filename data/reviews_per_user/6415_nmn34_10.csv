It," Starts Too Strong but Still a Good Hour and a Half
","Unfortunately its two and a half hours. I liked this movie, it was a good movie for the most part and the first ten minutes are extremely scary. Pennywise in the sewer, luring a child closer before ultimately stealing him away is one of the most memorable scenes I have seen this year. Unfortunately, it sets the bar too high for the rest of the movie and it never reaches that point again. An the simple reason is that it hows too much. There is no mystery as to what Pennywise does, it lays everything out on the bed like the clothes did for you when you were twelve. He rips a kid's arm off for God's sake, there is no reason to feel that Billy is justified in that his brother still may be alive somewhere when we just saw the kid get ate nor any reason to wonder what happened to the other kids that went missing. This makes the movie grow stale after a while, it still good for a while but eventually it overstays its welcome.Perhaps that makes it a problem, there is too much Pennywise. At the very least too much direct activity from him. Skarsgard was good at the role, he was wonderfully imposing in front of the young cast but was fairly single minded. He is there to eat kids, and that was pretty much it. He lacks the maliciousness of Tim Curry, who drew far more pleasure tormenting his victims before the hunt. Skarsgard instead pops up in just about every scene, not as a malevolent presence but as a physical flesh and blood monster chasing the kids around around with little exception. As I said, there is no mystery about him and his intent is abundantly clear. Seeing him again becomes less about his intentions and more the signal for the next chase. Its still scary but gradually is hurt by diminishing returns. I was done after the haunted crack house but still had the final confrontation in the sewers to go through.The movie also managed to hit my biggest pet peeve, swearing children. Smart mouthed children are fine, even though he was supposed to be annoying I was fine with Richie from the TV movie, but in this day and age it seems to be that wise guy means foul mouthed little brat. This Richie is especially egregious, from credits to credits every line has to have a swear or mention of the size of his penis.",8,4,8,17 September 2017
Train to Busan," Hard to Think What to Title This, Its a Zombie Movie
","Zombie movies are very samey,there is no denying this. There is rarely anything that strays from the zombie formula, rarely do you see anything but the immediate start of the outbreak or the recent aftermath. Train to Busan doesn't break from this tradition and doesn't bring anything new to the genre but what it does it does very well.The setting is perfect for a zombie outbreak, a confined space where there is nowhere to run but still provides better security than being outside. It makes the initial slaughter more plausible, the people that are immediately infected aren't just gawking as the first person is attacked, they're actually trapped and picked off in a domino effect. As they try to flee down the cramped isle, they are picked off by a constantly growing number of zombies until they could reach the relative safety of the next car only for it to fall to a similar fate. Its only when the front of the line manage to put some distance between them that they are able to secure themselves in the first class car. Since the train is almost constantly moving, they are safe from the zombies outside as it searches for safe haven but they can't just get rid of the zombies they have since they control the coupling. And when a small band of survivors are trapped in the rear, the train becomes an convincing gauntlet Te zombies themselves aren't much to look at, they are the usual bullet to the head zombies alas the Of The Dead series and there isn't much to differentiate them from normal people other than glassy eyes and possibly the injury that converted them so cosmetically they aren't the most interesting to look at. The outbreak was too recent to for them to undergo any purification so their makeup is minimal. In motion however they have a lot more going for them. They are quick when motivated and chase their prey with single minded determination but when left alone they meander about like they were in the Thriller video. It is kind of hokey but its seeing them get up more than makes up for it. Rather than just climbing to their feet they contort and twist their bodies until they're on their feat. The process is unnatural and unnerving to watch and is really all there is to set it apart from most zombie movies.Characters are done well but are pretty much what one would expect from the genre. Just about everyone fits into an archetypal role, the cowardly antagonist, the caring father, the too good daughter, the plucky young man and his girl, and the like. Everyone fits into two terms I could borrow from wrestling, the baby faces and the heels, and they fit them well. The faces are likable, even when they do have their faults they are genuinely good people and learn from them. You route for them and mourn when they fall short. The heels are detestable, they wallow in their inadequacy and are genuinely hate-able people that you feel glad when they receive their comeuppance. It is generally the response you would want from the audience, there aren't mixed messages that the hero is secretly a terrible person. And they drive one of the main themes of the movie home well, the sacrifice of the father for the good of the family.The downside, it falls for the same trappings as most zombie movies. I mentioned the gauntlet earlier, it is a great idea but with some thought it seems completely unnecessary. The small party were in a safe-ish part of the train, with a little work they should have been able to secure it better and just hunkered down. They could have even contacted the main party and given them updates on their situation, running the gauntlet only puts themselves at greater risk, had they just remained there almost all of the later deaths could have been avoided. But alas, it is a zombie movie and careful strategics has no place when suicidal pro-activity is an option.",8,3,7,14 April 2017
Bird Box," Lawless Horror Movies Are Never Good
","They got a very good cast, an award winning director, and well received source material to build off of. There is a lot going for this movie going in, but unfortunately it loses something in the translation. The script is atrocious. Everything is done to the best of everyone's ability, its just that it isn't that good.The discourse between characters is abhorrent and I can't blame Sandra Bullock or John Malkovich. They deliver their lines very well, its just that what they say is often head scratchingly stupid. For example, Greg (BD Wong) wants to try to see the creatures through his security camera, which is an acceptable line of thinking. It sets the precedent that you don't need direct line of sight for the monster to effect you. But its how he tries to explain his plan, trying to blind the audience with an overly sciency, not scientific, explanation about waves and heat distortion that hearing aloud makes his plan even less convincing. Then he looks at it through a regular camera and kills himself because that couldn't have been a stupider idea. This issue comes up constantly, nothing sounds right. Malorie (Sandra Bullock) starts talking to her sister about going out for drinks while pregnant after her ultrasound in front of her doctor, to which the doctor replies with a mildly miffed equivalent to 'I'll pretend I didn't hear that.' Tom (Trevante Rhodes) is written like a 80s cartoon character, he is perfect in every way and devoid of any reasoning. He is ready to help anyone without so much as a thought to self preservation and does so pretty much of his own accord. Douglas (John Malkovitch) gets it pretty bad, he is just engrossed with all the negative traits Tom lacks and painted to be the jerk of the group in spite of an impressive track record on being right. This culminates in the 'Make the apocalypse great again' which is supposed to remind everyone that he is the callous jerk as everyone rolls their eyes at him, but its just so out of left field that it is blatant why it was written in. Its not a condemnation of him, they've already done that the entire movie, its an insult towards half the movie's potential audience. The sudden flash of elitism wouldn't have been half as insulting had the movie been written more intelligently, its like being called an idiot by a D student.The monsters themselves have no rhyme or reason. There is never an explanation of what they are or where they are from. This isn't in itself a negative as left to the audience's imagination they can probably conceive of something better than the writer could have imagined. What isn't acceptable is that there is no explanation of what they can do. They give a bare minimum explanation that the sight of it will cause madness or suicidal depression, but that's it. Everything else is hypothesized but is then conflicted with new evidence. At first, the monster is thought unable to interact with the real world, and thereby can't open doors, but then shakes a car and jostles leaves. It has the ability to speak at the end, but it leaves a question as to why it doesn't do so early on from behind the door. There is nothing that explains why one person becomes suicidal and another crazy but infers at the end that there is a way to differentiate them from normal people through their eyes. This is never explained how nor the validity tested. So in the end, things happen and there is no explanation. You just got Happening-ed.The worst is yet to come however as it seems they ran out of material and just shoestring whatever they had together in convenience and blatant plot armor for the final act. The plot is told through flashbacks that pointed out who wasn't going to make it like a red shirt on Star Trek, as the three survivors of the group, Malorie and the two children, raft down a river to sanctuary. Then come the rapids. The audience is aware that they are the looming threat by this point and we were left at a cliffhanger as one of them is going to have to navigate. Instead of what you expect to happen, they decide to go blind and immediately capsize. Making it to shore, Malorie must quickly find the kids and its far more anticlimactic than this sentence would lead you to believe. Still blindfolded she finds them in less than a minute and they continue through the woods as they rush to bring it all home. They don't care anymore, they open a can of cheap drama, and dump you in an unsatisfying ending where nothing is accomplished. This was the hook, the big event they were building up to, and its pretty much yada yada-ed. And to make it worse, the book handled it better by simply having Malorie take off her blindfold.This movie would not have done well had it gone to theaters, had it been anywhere but Netflix it would have bombed. It tries to emulate A Quiet Place but somehow ends up feeling more like The Happening. It has short glimmers of hope and the cast did what they could, but the writing was just not there for them and they are left running from the wind.",3,8,13,17 January 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," This Movie is Almost 3 Hours!?
","There is no better compliment for a long movie than to not realize it is a long movie. It means that the movie is engaging enough to keep you invested for the entire run time. This is definitely one of those movies. Set prior to the Manson Family murders, Tarantino's new film follows a pretty boy actor whose career is coming to an end and his gopher stunt double and friend. Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is trying to turn his dying career around, looking for one more breakthrough role, but its just not happening. Like many of the young pretty boy actors of classical Hollywood, he is just not transitioning to the new age of 60s Hollywood. Meanwhile, his only friend during this troubled period, Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt), is contentedly coasting through life. He has no qualms as long as he gets to work for his friend, but his carefree lifestyle runs him afoul of the notorious Manson Family. And then Tarantino happens.Tarantino knows how to design a world. In his own version of the 1960s, he crafts something that's wonderfully familiar and yet something all his own. His committment to the setting is phenomenal, bringing up even the smallest details that most wouldn't know. For instance, Italian movies of the time often would bring in actors from around the world and had them deliver their lines in their native languages, later redubbing them in post. There are even scenes where nothing is going on, and he just wants to show off his handiwork. Yet they don't drag the movie for an instant.In spite of the directors reputation, there is little violence in this movie. Two and a half hours of this movie has only occasional instances but the vast majority of it is dedicated to the drama of Dalton's floundering career. And none of it drags. DiCaprio and Pitt are charming and funny and the number of familiar faces that pop up is a stark reminder of talent seemingly forgotten in the modern age. But the gloves have to come off eventually, and Tarantino pulls no punches. That last ten minutes is brutal as only the most violent man in Hollywood could make it.This movie is a blast.",10,48,82,4 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Don't Think About It
","If the creature's only sense is acute hearing, wouldn't it be rather easy to elude them? Every time they attack, just throw a distraction in the opposite direction. If they kill everything that makes a noise, why is there so much ambient noise? Wouldn't they tear through the native fauna in an instant? Wouldn't the weight of the corn kernels on top form a more solid surface, depriving you the ability to swim through it like Scrooge McDuck's rural equivalent? The answer to these questions is simple. Don't think about it. A Quiet Place is a great movie, everything it does it does masterfully, don't sweat the details.The big draw here is sound. This movie knows how to work the audience, and does it by denying you of hearing. There is so little dialogue, so many scenes with little more than ambient sound, and times where they deprive you even of that, it sets an impeccable atmosphere of distress and hopelessness. While there are still signs of life, and they aren't the last survivors on earth, but it shows that they are in dire straights. There is nothing to keep the monsters at bay, closing a door might as well be sealing your own coffin, their only hope is to avoid drawing their attention. As such, they go to such great lengths to avoid making any sound like walking on sand and avoiding any food that crinkles like bags of chips. But then they took it a step further and use sound to convey a key plot point, the sister is deaf. The father works on an ear piece but there is no explanation as to what it is until the daughter puts it on, and the sound just stops. Its such a compelling way to convey her affliction, I cannot stress that scene enough.The monsters, I found, to be a little lacking. In spite their seemingly glowing weakness, they just came off as too overpowered. They are faster than any human, strong enough to tar through steel, and their design looks formidable, but they aren't as memorable as something like the xenomorphs or the predator. There is just so little flair to them, which is a shame as they are so frequently visible. The scenes where they are out of focus are fine but when you do get a good look at them, they look like they were ripped from something else, like a zerg prototype from Starcraft or some bug that never made it into Stormship Troopers. But they do their job at least, and the scene where it exposes what I can only describe as its ear were interesting enough.Ultimately, this is the easiest recommendation I could make this year. This is a great horror movie that just requires the Gremlins treatment. Don't worry about the details, the obvious audience cues or the negative critiques by some overly political nut jobs, and just let yourself be swept away in the bleak atmosphere and compelling family drama.",9,1,3,23 April 2018
Kong: Skull Island," It Doesn't Put King Kong on a Pedestal
","The highest praise I can give this movie, it is not just a retelling of King Kong. I was introduced to the character with the 1933 original as a kid, watched it again with the 76 remake, and sat through the the 2005 Peter Jackson version. I will start fires if I have to watch another origin story in my lifetime. Instead, Skull Island is moving the series in an actual direction building up to the upcoming Godzilla crossover. And I would rate it a step up from the American Godzilla predecessor.Visually the movie looks great. The monsters are fascinating to look at, the giant water buffalo are especially well done with the algae hanging from their horns and soulful eyes. The massive spider is more stylized with its gnashing claws and 'meaty' webbing but doesn't look hokey. And Kong himself is very detailed and quite expressive, its easy to see where the effects budget went and it was money well spent. But there is also artistry that went into presenting it. Scenes like Kong standing before the sunset, his silhouette blurred by the light, and his eyes piercing through the night mist as he draws close are more memorable than the actual action scenes. The only real complaint I have is the design of the skull crawlers themselves. Seeing all these interesting creatures, a two legged lizard is kind of a disappointment in comparison. They don't look like the credible threat they pose to Kong and the big, bad one looks too similar to the smaller jobbers to make it stand out.Characters are pretty good at best to acceptable at worst, the best being Goodman's Bill Randa and John C Reily's Hank Marlow, but what they do with them is rather underwhelming. To cull the large cast, many o the cannon fodder characters are killed off pretty early but you kind of see how they all die in the first ten minutes. Either they are swallowed whole, stomped or otherwise crushed, or swatted into the distance, and rarely in new or creative ways. After seeing three people get stepped on, the impact is quickly lost. The key characters don't get much better treatment. The captain with the major insignia, swallowed. Bill, swallowed. Samuel Jackson, crushed by Kong. The soldier with an AK for reasons, he gets a little something different but its still pretty much him being swat into a cliff. His death is probably the most frustrating as it at first seems like it is going to have more significance. He is ready to sacrifice himself to kill the giant skull crawler but no, it turns out to be completely meaningless. I will give San some credit for surviving. When she was introduced without a single line of dialogue I was sure she was screwed.Tom Hiddleston as James Conrad is pretty wooden and I started to play the action hero name game after a while when he was on screen. My best were Buff Hardchest, Quad Rockman, and Ron McMuscles, but while kind of boring and lifeless he wasn't the character that agitated me the most. That goes to Mason Weaver, the anti-war reporter. I found her character insufferable, the archetype non military character that challenges the system because she somehow knows better than everyone else. Of course she is right in the end which makes her even more obnoxious but some of her proposals are rather reprehensible. When the soldiers are trying to push westward against Hank's advice, they are doing so under the auspices of rescuing the stranded captain. Though the audience is already aware that he is dead, there is no way that any of them would be aware of this so by going against the system is tantamount to leaving a man behind. A man that has a child back home he was trying to get back to in time for their birthday. How none of the soldiers that they had shown to be close to him didn't punch her in the face for that I cannot imagine.As a vehicle to set up an upcoming movie, I really liked this. It has some stupid decisions but they aren't as jarring as some movies. And I am thoroughly hyped for Godzilla vs Kong now. Its an interesting change of pace.",8,1,5,8 April 2017
Wonder Woman," A Great Movie That Makes A Fatal Mistake.
","DC's movies have not been great. I'd even go so far as to say they haven't been good. Fortunately for Warner Brothers, Wonder Woman is far better than their latest crop of movies and actually rivals the recent clutch of Marvel films. For once, DC didn't screw this up.Gal Godot is Wonder Woman as Margot Robbie was Harley Quinn. I am hard pressed to think of any actress that could do the role better. But unlike Suicide Squad, the writing wasn't an abomination of cringe worthy dialogue and very short sighted plot development. There are moments of cringe, I'll get to that later, but by and large the movie is simple in focus and coherent in practice. She has a single goal, defeat Ares and end WWI, and a character of someone would understand and somewhat expect from someone of her up bringing. She was raised as royalty on a secluded island, put through extreme training far exceeding her peers, and had been constantly fed the same story. When she grows up and is exposed to the world at large, she is headstrong, a little stupid, but strong enough to brute force her way through any situation. She charges into no man's land without a second thought, tries to assassinate a German general in the middle of a gala surrounded by soldiers, and is so dead set on killing Ares that she is easily fooled into suspecting the wrong man to be him. And she does all this because she doesn't know any better. On all accounts she is her own worst enemy, she knows the pointy end of a sword from the not the pointy end in a time where bolt action rifles have replaced swords, but like a good baby face she still muscles up the fortitude to persevere.The effects are good with a couple exceptions here and there but they are a little overused. Seeing her block bullets is cosmetically pleasing, they use slowdown well so that you can see the bullet pancake, the first few times. Then they keep doing it. Again and again, just enough to kill the impact of the effect but not enough to frustrate the audience. They merely get numb to it. Still, the no man's land scene was very well done, with tracer bullets exploding against her shield and slapping a mortar out of the air. There are times where the CGI is terrible however and they usually involve hitting guns. They crumple under her fist in a way that looks like a cinematic from a PS2 game. You know they aren't real things in the environment.As I said, there are a few gaffes here and there. When the Germans try to capture Steve Trevor, you can see gun boats in the distance but they didn't play any role in the battle with the Amazons. You'd think they'd at least try to bombard the island after learning the inhabitants are hostile, or at least clear the cliffs so their ground troops could land safely. Mustard gas has no effect on Diana, she charges in to find an entire town dead and while Trevor can't get near the cloud, she walks out as right as rain. Furthermore, the movie takes place at the closing of the war but mustard gas has not been used yet nor is it ever used on enemy soldiers. They even ignore the fatal flaw of such a weapon, the threat of the wind blowing it back at your own troops. Theoretically, the Hitler in their universe would be even worse than the Hitler of ours. Not witnessing the horrible effects of poison gas first hand, he would not have detested such a weapon so much not to use it on the front lines. But these are relatively minor gripes, and they don't really mount to much.The one terrible thing about this movie I can ascribe, it failed to live up to its purpose. This movie was a set up for the upcoming Justice League movie. I don't want to see the Justice League movie, I want Wonder Woman 2. This movie out hyped the headliner which can be bad news for WB. That being said, while I want a sequel, I know it cannot live up to the expectations of this one. And that is because of the choice of villain, Ares. There is no one in her villain menagerie that can follow him. She went from zero to the second coming of Jesus and smite the devil in one movie. I'm not saying Blue Snowman should have got top billing but had they started with a major villain like Barrenness Paula von Gunther, they could have built for him to star in a sequel or even a third movie. After this, who is going to believe a regular human NAZI is going to pose any threat to a killer of gods? No one, because WB wanted to churn a quick set up for a movie that already looks like a dumpster fire. All this universe garbage killed any chance of a good sequel.",8,0,5,18 June 2017
The Greatest Showman," A Visual Treat but Narratively Weak
","PT Barnum is the greatest carny to have ever lived. This is the undeniable truth every Connecticut resident should have drilled into them from cradle to the grave. This film, it doesn't seem to capture his greatness, his autobiography makes a far more interesting tale, but it at least provides for an interesting diversion. The music is good and the choreography is excellent, the story while watered down at least flows well so as to keep your interest. Its just that instead of the greatest showman they present an unnecessarily family friendly imitation.This needs repeating, the choreography is top notch. There is so much going on in every song and dance it can't all be caught in a single viewing. Their timing is perfect, the bar scene where shots are being slid, caught, and downed is so fluid its like watching the waves crashing into the shore. Everything is perfectly natural, like going to an actual Barnum & Bailey show (RIP). That is until they bring in the animals. Its hard to believe that they couldn't find any animal trainers for this movie, I know quite a few that could use the work, but the CGI is an abomination. Tom Thumb riding the horse looks like hot garbage, the elephants in the musical number look faker than if it was a man in a mask,. and the horses in the final number... they are a three frame gif. Considering everything else they had shown throughout the film, its just unacceptable.The writing is the weakest point of the movie, there is no conflict. Disregarding how it strayed from the actual life of PT Barnum, the caricature they give has no real trouble. He goes from being laid off when his employer goes belly up to success in half of the first act. He goes from shunned by high society to well respectable impressario in two scenes. He loses everything an rebuilds in one scene. Everything he does is trivialized by his immediate success so soon afterward to such a degree that nothing seems to matter. And the way they solve these problems are infuriating. A struggling business venture solved by his daughter with one line as he tucks her in the very next scene after the only person he could sell tickets to was his family. There is no build, the answer is given to him plain as day by a literal plot device. Its impossible to write a review with spoilers, there is absolutely nothing here to spoil.The major flaw with Barnum is simply this, he has no flaws. This could be said somewhat about the real man, he was an otherwise upright man who supported emancipation, charity, and family friendly entertainment, but to his core he was a carny. His early career was rife with trickery, from the Feejee Mermaid to exit signs written in other languages so that visitors had to pay to get back in. He was a great talker never to be left outside arm's reach. The film never goes into that. They say he is the King of Humbuggery, but he does little to warrant the title. In fact, they even go to great lengths to over up his exploits. Tom Thumb is introduced at 25, a dwarf hidden away by his mother. He was adopted by the real Barnum at 4 and started performing at 5. It gets to the point that the only real connection between the two is a name and a gift of gab.I don't think this is a terrible movie. Reading the 11 questions from EW and some of the professional reviews really makes it sound worse than it is. Its just a lacking movie. A movie about the man who watered down his stage play of Uncle Tom's Cabin to make it family friendly, its only fitting they do the same to him. I just have to question why they chose to put a trailer for The Commuter with a scene of a man being pushed in front of a bus before it. Right after the Gnome sequel too. In fact, I question why most of the trailers were included when only one seemed age appropriate.",7,0,2,2 January 2018
Annihilation," Unfortunately Destined to be a Cult Classic
","Two year after Sony and Paul Feig's controversial and disastrous marketing campaign, Paramount releases another movie with an all female cast, and it does as well as one would expect in a poisoned well. And that is a shame. Annihilation is a very well acted and intelligent scifi horror movie that deserved far more attention that it received.The writing in this movie for the most part is very good. Though they aren't given too much time to themselves, Lena's squad has enough depth to make them each feel they belong in the story and Lena is a fascinating character. Everything in the Shimmer, the dome of light that swallowed up a small town after an interstellar object fell on the outskirts of it, plays out naturally through her interactions with them. Everyone has a reason for the way they are, whether it be Dr Ventress listless speaking tone or Thorenson's tendency for self harm, and why they are on their path of self destruction. They are aware they are likely to die, or worse, end up like Lena's husband, Cain, but are adamant o undergo their mission, at least until they see what may become of them. There are some questionable moments of dialogue, at one point Shepard asks where Lena learned to shoot after they manage to kill a mutant alligator, which one would think they would have been aware of when they gave her an M16 when they sent her in, but they are rare and far between. Where the writing did fail completely was the framing scenes. A horror movie works by withholding information, the most important being what happened to them. This movie tells who the red shirts are immediately, telling the audience who lives and who dies. It hurts the suspense of a mutant bear attacking hem in the dark when you know who it takes. Furthermore, it serves more as exposition, taking you out of the story to tell you what you probably could have figured out if you paid an ounce of attention.The body horror is excellent, what the Shimmer does to the flora, fauna, and the squad is sometimes beautiful, more often horrifying, but always engaging. Plants that grow in the shape of humans and bears that can mimic their victims, there is so much to see that its hard to get bored, but its the changes they start feeling that steals the show. Scenes like a soldiers guts writhing in his stomach like a snake and his corpse becoming a giant fungal splatter on the wall drives home that even if they make it out, they aren't going to be the same again. The fear of becoming something other than human is ever present, especially when you see the horrors it can create.Was the movie hurt by its cast? No, an all female cast isn't the cause. It appears Paramount's lack of faith in the project doomed it. Its poor performance with test audiences ensured it would never get a limited foreign market release and put little effort in getting its name out there like they did Arrival.",8,2,6,11 March 2018
Alien: Covenant," The Aliens Movie I Still Never Wanted
","The Alien franchise has gotten on Mr. Bones Wild Ride and the end is nowhere to be seen. When audiences saw the giant mummified alien in the first movie, they awed blissfully unaware that they were going to be stuck hearing about them 30 years later. And that is the crutch of everything wrong with this movie: its head has firmly disappeared up its own arse.There is a danger in writing stories with in depth lore. In crafting the world, you easily forget to actually tell an interesting story. Alien Covenant isn't an interesting story where the characters have agency in the events unfolding, its events 1000 years ago. But then why not just make a movie about events 1000 years ago? Why do we need to involve people in the now? And how does this help them overcome their current situation? Now 1000 years is hyperbole, but the rest of this is a legitimate issue. the whole movie feels like part of a bigger movie, a rather small part that was stretched well beyond its means. As though they took the scene where Kane gets the face hugger attached to his face from the first film, ran it until the xenomorph burst from his chest, and stretched it for an hour and a half before rolling credits. Yes they are planning to add more as the series continues, but everything here was so unsubstantial, its already wearing thin. It just doesn't feel like a complete movie.This is especially disappointing as there is something to thee characters. There are a lot of them that seem like they would be compelling if given the chance. The religious first mate and his wife/girlfriend, the pilot and his wife who is also a pilot, and the terraforming experts whose husband was the captain before his hibernation pod fell and turned into an oven for some reason (kind of a serious design flaw), there was a lot that they could have done with them if they gave them some sort of control over their lives. Instead they are unceremoniously popped off. Instead we get most of the story from the android, the one character who has as little personality as possible. Cold and unfeeling best describes the movie. Watching Michael Fastbender play two roles would be great if they weren't both him trying to be as stone faced as possible as he teaches himself to play the flute.There is too much emotional distance between the audience and the Covenant's crew already but the technique with which they are killed is also sorely lacking. Everyone has seen the tail in the shower scene from the trailer. What they don't realize is that i pretty much the entire scene. A good movie teases it, builds suspense gradually until the violins reach a crescendo and the audience is at the edge of their seats. Alien Covenant just drops it on the floor unceremoniously. It is worse than a jump scare, its a jump scare that tries to be more than it is but not very hard. The lack of suspense is palpable, even the xenomorphs are phoning it in. The first alien attack is in bright daylight, it sticks out like a sore thumb as a barely passable SyFy CGI neomoprph is born and immediately goes on a killing spree. In spite of the fact its four inches tall and they probably could have just put the boots to it. The alien is around too much, it climbs walls, walks in plazas, and descends ladders, we know so much about it that it ceases to be an ever present threat and becomes another character that doesn't really have any importance to the story.Now the alien, what have they done to them? There is something strange about how they consider them to 'evolve,' the superior alien is the black xenomorph over the white neomorphs but there explanation why falls on its face. Functionally, they are very similar. They move the same, have the same speed, and look generally the same, the only difference being the xenomorph's second mouth. But production wise, they made the xenomorph more complicated and dare say more vulnerable. It transitions through multiple stages to reach maturity, the face hugger, the larval, and the full sized form but that seems hardly as effective as their predecessor which has only two, spore and beast form. As weapon, it just adds more bulk to it, one face hugger needs a foot tall egg while the spore eggs are the size of a mushroom. The spores were even proved more fatal in the flashback, wiping out an entire colony of engineers in seconds. The neomorphs also take a lot more bullets to kill apparently, the infant neomorph takes a face full of buckshot like a champ. It doesn't even bleed. If Ripley fought a colony of that in Aliens, she'd be up a creek. The Covenant crew were lucky there were only two.I want a new Alien. Alien is one of the best horror movies. Aliens is one of the best action movies. Alien 3... lets just stop at Aliens. But what I am trying to get at is this Alien universe that they are creating is counter productive. It sucks the mystery out of everything and questioning where we came from isn't all that important when there is a giant space insect/penis about to bite your head off.",3,4,9,26 May 2017
