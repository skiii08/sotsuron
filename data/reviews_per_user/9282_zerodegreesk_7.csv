The Blair Witch Project," Scary as hell...
","I say so simply by having put myself into the situation in the movie.  When it was circulating as a bootleg, the rumour was that it was real archival footage...that's how it was marketed.  I only wish I had gotten to see it without knowing it was a fake.It can be scary, but I think you have to transport yourself into the situation.  There's no music to TELL YOU HOW TO FEEL.  I think this is one of the main factors to cause people to not like this movie.  Most movies, in general, rely on music to generate emotions in the viewer.  Slow romantic strings for love scenes, loud sticatto boomings for action scenes, etc.In BWP, the viewer is forced to pay attention to everything and consider how he would feel in the situation.  Or, something like that.It would have been much better if the staged 'interviews' were better performances.  Some were horribly obvious HORRIBLE actors.I was disturbed by the ending.  That was creepy.  Then, again, why were they still filming everything?  Would you be running up and down stairs in some abandoned home in the middle of nowhere with crazy witches all over with a camera blocking half your vision?",Null,0,1,31 August 2001
Minority Report," What the???
","Poor, poor story.  Sure it's contrived.  It's science-fiction.  But, this story doesn't even seem to follow the rules it creates for itself.  Tom Cruise's dilemma is fabricated in a way that simply doesn't work.  The climactic scene where the real bad-guy is revealed is pulled out of thin air through an opportune method that isn't even mentioned throughout the entire first 95% of the movie.  The plot holes are ridiculous and unforgivable, at times.  Then, the basic premise of the story, the idea of 'How far will society go to protect itself?'...  More crap about free-will and the idea of the power of one person over the majority and blah, blah, blah.  And, why did they have to date the movie?  Why '2054'?  What's the point of that? It's going to suffer the same fate as every other science-fiction movie with a definite date attached to it.  We should be traveling to Jupiter by now according to Hollywood.  We're going to be replacing our eyes for the fun of it in 50 years?  Yeah, it shouldn't be taken so seriously, but it's no more than a weak storyline/vehicle for more super-slick special effects.  More empty and boring crap for the masses.",7,1,2,31 December 2002
Unbreakable," it IS slow, but...
","aren't at least some of you tired of extreme-paced-editing, etc?  everything nowadays looks like a commercial on Mtv...this was definitely a cool story.  it convinced me of how a modern-day superhero would be...very realistic.  no grappling hooks and goofy costumes. just a normal guy who realizes the gifts he's been given and what he should do with them.i do agree with a previous comment:  why is everybody whispering all of the time?  except Samuel L. Jackson, but he's always a loud-mouthed character. 
**SPOILER** **SPOILER** **SPOILER**Unbreakable II: The return of Mr. Glass!  like Lex Luther escaping from prison in Superman II, etc.  invents a scheme to give the entire population of Philadelphia osteoporosis!",Null,0,0,31 August 2001
The Others," Scary...
","I've read many of the comments on this movie and while they don't 'spoil' the story completely, they do make too many references to other movies, one in particular, which could make the impact of this story less effective.  I think The Others is unique.  When you consider how predictable storylines are today, after seeing this one you'd have to give it some credit.  I give it a lot of credit.  And, this is on the story alone.  The movie is beautiful.  The use of lighting is fantastic.  Pay attention to the scenes in the dark, especially when Kidman is carrying a candle while searching for the others.  The candle could not possibly create the lighting you see.  To me it's like a painter on a canvas with the light, but it's transparent and skillful, so you hardly notice it.  It's difficult for me to explain.  It's unapologetic and true to life, the story and the occurrences, which I find rare in film today, especially in the States.  There are no judgements on what happens or what happened in the storyline.  The ideas of morality and good and bad seem to be dead and buried once the movie ends.  This makes the story even more chilling.  There are no clear-cut endings or explanations. This is why I find it so good.  It seems the majority of the viewing public want popular justice and easily understandable and predictable endings and plots.  The references to this movie being like another movie, I think, are true because the stories are of a similar topic, but more importantly because they're both powerfully independent and true to themselves.  You know when you see these films because they affect you profoundly and are difficult to shake off.  You find yourself thinking about them for days and watching multiple times.  Horror/Suspense is my favorite genre and I'd easily say I've seen every popular horror movie and many, many of the rarer sort in the genre.  This one is great.  10 out of 10.",10,0,0,18 May 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Just think: Starship Troopers... See this wasn't that bad!
","It's hard for me to comment too badly on this movie.  It's a fantasy movie. It's supposed to take you away into another world, away from your real crappy lives and entertain you.  If you want literature, read the book. If you want 400+ pages of character development, read the book.  There's the movie and the book.  They serve the same purpose through different mediums; one's better equipped to grab you around the neck and shake you around for a few hours, while the other will gently caress and nourish your mind over the course of several days.No movie based on a book, especially a book of this stature, will EVER live up to the expectations.  'The Exorcist' or 'The Godfather' or 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas' are examples of near perfection, in my opinion, but I'm sure there are those that disagree.Then, there's 'Starship Troopers'Just consider this last example.  What a horrible piece of crap that movie was.  It barely resembled the book past the title.  And the movie was horrible to boot!  Just imagine Casper Van Dien as Aragorn and Denise Richards as Arwen.  Directed by Paul Verhoven.I'm getting sick just from the thought of it.  See how great this movie really was, or at least how bad it COULD have been.  I appreciate it more already.I've been exposed to the Lord of the Rings books and stories and cartoon incarnations as long as I can remember.  I couldn't find many faults with this version, but after reading others' reviews, I could believe that if you weren't familiar with the stories that you might not have enjoyed it as much as I did.In the near 180 minutes that this movie spanned, there could have been a little less pointless CGI and a little more about the history of those involved, for the sake of those not familiar with the story.  In general, though, I'd have to say that the CGI didn't get in the way of the story half as much as it would have in some other director's hands.",5,2,3,4 January 2002
Shrek," Really too much hype
","Sometimes, people get carried away with the hype... I think that is what happened here.  There were some funny moments, but nothing that was just jaw-droppingly, side-splittingly hilarious and amazing.  So, computer animation is getting spectacular, big deal!  It's bound to happen.  I'd rather see a kid with a Commadore 64 and a more original / clever script. There would most likely be a superior product.Plus, what is with the 'Scottish-accent' and Mike Meyers???  So, the rumour is, after the entire movie is done he thinks it would be better with a Scottish-accent???  In 'So I Married an Axe-Murderer' and 'Austin Powers' it was used effectively, but it's obvious he doesn't have such a grasp of the dialect to use it for an entire script.Eventually, a computer is going to be able to produce something which looks identical to real life.  Will that be a good thing?  What will be amazing about that when you can film the real thing?  Call me a spoil-sport.5 out of 10",5,0,0,20 November 2001
Donnie Darko," wow...
","I watched this five days ago and the more and more I think about it the more and more I appreciate it.  It's a got a part to it that resembles teen angst and makes me laugh to think I like it 'cause that's a while ago.  But, as a whole, this movie touches multiple levels at the same time.  It's not just Donnie, I mean it is, but it goes much deeper than this.  All I'll say is that this is one of the best modern movies I've seen in a long time.  In an age when a movie is based on how extreme it is, this manages to be effective on pure emotion.  There's one gimick in it that rubs me the wrong way, but I'm sure once I see it a few more times, I'll understand why it was used. '11 out of 10' I'd give this movie if it was possible.",8,0,0,7 April 2002
