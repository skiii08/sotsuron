Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars Episode 1 = Highlander 2
","Anyone who doesn't quite understand that comparison and actually has seen Highlander 2 has already been sucked in by the bad acting, poor directing, and abhorred story line of this pathetic farce of a science fantasy movie.Our only hope is that Lucas doesn't direct Episode 2.",1,0,1,31 March 2000
The Matrix Reloaded," not enough and too much
","Remember Back to the Future, Part 2? Remember how it seemed to serve no purpose other then to set up the cliffhanger for the third part? Well, here you have the same, a little shinier, a little louder, but still just a glorified cliffhanger. ...too much Zion silliness. The opening half hour could simply be cut from the movie, and the sex scene between Neo and Trinity seemed more like an excuse to show Carrie-Anne Moss' butt then an expression of actual feeling. ...too much zen mastering from Morpheus. ...too much eye candy. You read that right. The first Matrix struck a very fine balance in the action scenes between what was possible and what was just outside of possible. Seeing Neo fly around like Superman is a little to far outside of that, as is him fighting 100 Smith's. Cool, yes. Good, no. ...not enough mystery. The first Matrix was a story of Neo discovering who he was, among other things. Now that Neo is god, what do you do with him? Turn him into a comic book super hero, apparently. ...not enough plot. Between sweaty church raves, emotionless sex, dialouge reminicent of a middle school Hamlet, rougue programs who of course chose to be french, more silly dialouge, headache inducing action scenes, and more stilted dialouge during the headache inducing action scenes there is about 5 minutes of story. And even THAT isn't very good.Oh well. Give me the blue pill. Please.",6,0,0,15 May 2003
The Sixth Sense," a very mediocre movie cleverly disguised as a very good movie..
","Perhaps knowing how the movie ended (or at least one of the main points of it) took something away from the experience.  Perhaps looking for all the details that I was told I would have to see the movie a second time to catch prevented me from enjoying it.  Or perhaps, just perhaps, there really wasn't as much that was special, different, or outstanding in this movie to validify all the acclaim it has garnered.  It was boring in places, overly drawn out throughout, and had no outstanding performances by any of the actors.  There were many, MANY plot holes that were simply left to fester, and the end was a little to reminiscent of 'Ghost' for my taste.  Not a bad movie, but no better than 'Stir of Echoes,' to be sure.",5,2,3,24 March 2000
