Minority Report," Science-Fiction continues to evolve
","Minority Report is another science-fiction film that takes the genre to new places. Once again we see a blockbuster sci-fi making excellent use of advances in computer and SFX technology to create a hybrid of action and thriller. 'The Fifth Element' was one of the first sci-fi's to use a major movie star alongside stunning effects. 'The Matrix' built on this with the inclusion of a mind-twisting plot and now Minority Reports carries the trend on with superb action and an enthralling narrative. The film mixes a futuristic D.C.,complete with monorail-advanced and helicopters with rotating seats, alongside a present D.C. that still has malls and balloon sellers. We get a compelling story with an array of gadgets, chases and chrome. I like it!",8,0,0,26 January 2003
Gangs of New York," a lover of film's honest opinion
","This film is amazing! I am a media student, I study films and it is true to say that Gangs of New York does not have a huge amount to say. It is not heavily symbolic and it is a mainstream money-grabber, however sometimes films do not have to be original or re-defining to warrant praise.No one would deny that this film is visually stunning and contains some breathtaking action scenes, on par with Saving Private Ryan. This alone is a good enough reason to see it, yet there is so much more to this movie. The acting is first-class, Daniel Day-Lewis is brilliant and Caprio holds his own in a cast with overwhelming ability. The one thing that lets the acting down is the erratic Irish accents, a mix between American and Father Ted, but this is a minor gripe. Many argue the story is poor and the ending even worse, well the story (without spoiling it) has been seen countless times before and has been successful. As I said before, a plot does not have to be original to be effective. This story weaves perfectly with the action, drama and comedy and allows Scorsese to display his superb talent of portraying real problems with an entertaining exaggeration Gangs of New York should leave you thinking 'wow' just watch it for fun and not to see if it's worth the hype.",Null,0,0,19 January 2003
