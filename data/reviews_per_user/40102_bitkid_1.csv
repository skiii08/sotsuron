Antz," Computer Movie of the century
","It is amazing how they have managed, to make everything look so realistic. Nothing ever stands still, and they actually move 10000 antz at the same time. This film is so fantastic, that I doubt 'a bugs life' will reach its knees, if you know what I mean.",10,0,0,13 November 1998
