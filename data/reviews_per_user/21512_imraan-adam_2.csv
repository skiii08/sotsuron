Black Swan," Just Awful!
","An absolute masterpiece? I don't think so. Honestly, this movie never excited me a wee bit throughout. Natalie does, however, act quite well but this so called movie hit is awful.After being nominated for so many awards, I honestly expected something pretty close to perfect. Instead, its packed with unexplainable horror scenes. The lesbian scene was so horrible and it just added an extra bit of terribleness to such a highly anticipated movie.It's a shame though because the storyline really sounds unique and interesting. However it does not live up to expectations and becomes just another come and go thriller. My score? 1 out of 10. In fact I think thats even too high.",1,12,20,25 January 2011
Captain America: Civil War," Marvel's Best Thus Far!!
","This is without a doubt, the best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe at the moment. Usually, I require a re-watch to decide on how great the film truly is, however, with Civil War, the initial screening was more than enough.Everything from the story to the action sequences were executed brilliantly. The Russo's did a fantastic job fitting all these characters into a powerful and entertaining film. Not a single character felt unnecessary or out of place, with each one adding to the overall point of the plot. Speaking of characters, I won't spoil too much but Black Panther was unbelievably awesome. Chadwick Boseman nailed the African accent and his reasons/morals for being involved in the story were very compelling. Then of course, there is the much anticipated Spider Man. The characters introduction to the MCU was always going to be a tricky one but unveiling Peter Parker in this film were both well-timed and incredibly refreshing. If there was one type of character arc the MCU needed, it was a young, out of place individual. Tom Holland executed his role to perfection. It is clear from his (surprisingly non-brief appearance) that Peter is still unclear on what it really means to be an enhanced 'superhero', while still maintaining the character's smart, comedic nature.Many similarities can be drawn from the Russo's previous Cap film especially with the fighting style and preference to less CGI usage. Seriously, if there is one thing that can spoil a good story, it is the over-usage of CGI. There are some standout hand-to-hand combat scenes that will blow you away, very similar to Cap and Winter Soldiers fight scenes in the previous film. Just be prepared to see much MUCH more of them in this film.Overall, this is an absolutely fantastic film and gives a lot more to think about regarding the future of the franchise. It is safe to say that with the Russo's on board, Infinity War will be spectacular and less hurried and overcrowded which was the case with Age of Ultron.Captain America Civil War will highly satisfy Marvel fans and most definitely entertain the casual movie-goer. I will definitely be seeing it again and pre-ordering the Blu-ray version. Oh, and please stick around for the post-credit scenes (notice how I said SCENES!), they are very important to the story line and quite awesome as well.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! 10/10",10,7,16,2 May 2016
