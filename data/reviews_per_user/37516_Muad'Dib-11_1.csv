Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," May The Farce Be With You
","Just to quickly add to the comments from people who have a problem with the film, 'so do I'.I saw the first trilogy at the cinema when they were all initially shown and I saw this film on it's opening morning. I still consider Star Wars IV to be the best film ever but The Phantom Menace annoys me in parts.  Firstly, I belong to the corner that wants rid of Jar Jar.  Please, if he's going to be in the second film kill him off quickly or let him make his excuses and GO.Secondly, Darth Maul is the only 'bad' person in any film ever made where I wanted him to triumph. I was totally annoyed at not just the fact he was killed but in the stupid manner in how he was killed - PLEASE, how can Obi-Wan do what he did whilst DM just stood there with lightsabre in hand and just froze??? I had no feelings for Qui-Gon.  I would have liked to see more of DM.  George Lucas could have written a fight scene in Mos Eisley with some of the locals from the Cantena bar.  This would have served as a better introduction to the mysterious Jedi.Also, the battle droids looked like skinny greyhounds.  Again, like their Stormtrooper friends they couldn't hit anything either. I think Lucas incorrectly aimed the film primarily at a younger audience and had the word MERCHANDISE tatooed on his forehead.  What about all your loyal fans for the last 20+ years George??? The film started so well but became tedious and often boring in parts. It was also obvious that Natalie Portman was playing two roles??Anyway, it's about time Lucas gave the fans something they really wanted:- The original trilogy on DVD...NOW, and a darker second episode similar to The Empire Strikes Back.  Get Lawrence Kasden involved again if necessary.",Null,0,1,13 February 2001
