Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," eh
","Visually stunning but go back to the masks and rubber costumes. Frankly, they look better.As far as the plot, Lucas has done all that was probably possible. More character development was definitely necessary, especially in the realms of Darth Maul and Obi Wan. And get rid of that Gungan idiot.",7,0,0,20 May 1999
Fight Club," Dark, funny, gruesome, brilliant
","Brilliant film. David Fincher has done it again. Although Alien 3 was not received very well, you can see how his dark and grim directing style has progressed to include the witty and humorous side of relatively brutal material.Edward Norton proves once again to be one of the most versatile actors of the decade, although I thought Pitt's performance was not his best (12 Monkey's and Seven Year's in Tibet show him at his best, I feel). Helena Bonham Carter actually reminded me of a tweaked-out Elaine from Sienfeld. Sorry :)As you may have heard, the ending is a bit of a let down but overall the movie is definitely worth your time.",8,0,1,15 October 1999
American History X," Ed Norton is really, really great
","Wow. I liked him in a bunch of other movies, but he's really good in this flick. This role has him playing a neo-Nazi who finds the error of his ways in prison, a role I wouldn't have thought he could pull of this well.
Really great film, good work all around by the actors, and a very good bit of writing by David McKenna.",8,0,0,16 January 2000
Toy Story 2," Great
","Great. One of the best I've seen.... no, no, wait. Probably the best I've seen this year so far. Mind you, 'Man on the Moon', 'Bicentennial Man', 'Magnolia', 'Cradle Will Rock' and 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' are still on the way, but this movie was certainly worth my while.Thanks for your time.",9,0,1,15 December 1999
The Matrix," Even better the second time around...
","Just saw it again for the first time since the original theatrical release. I guess the Oscar hype and whatnot got me thinking about it again. Man, those were some crazy special effects. It seems to me that if they are going ahead and making it into a trilogy, then this may become the Star Wars of the techie universe.Good fun.",9,0,0,1 April 2000
The Matrix," Great
","Great flick. Fantastic special effects, and a great plot. Unless someone's told you the main idea behind the movie, you're really kept guessing as to what's going on until almost half way through. It's the first entertaining movie I've seen in a while (maybe I don't get out as much as I should).",9,0,0,2 April 1999
