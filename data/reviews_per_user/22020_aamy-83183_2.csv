Howl's Moving Castle," Just a pretty face
","This movie falls short in what should be the main reason to make a movie: it has no coherent story whatsoever. There's zero character development and they start to care for each other for no reason.
They adapted the original story to be a critique on war, but they failed even on that. Howl fights against a few warships and then what? That's a superficial strategy to fight war, just as superficial as the whole movie. In the end, the war is over as if it where a mere whim of the king's magician!
The only parts of the movie that actually get to your heart are the ones that they got from the book. Such a waste of plots.
The aesthetic is beautiful, but they should put more effort on the character's facial expressions and the script, because a pretty movie with no plot is just a waste of time and money.",4,3,4,12 April 2020
The Book Thief," A lot of potencial wasted
","The movie has good scenery and seem to be historically correct, but it fails in the acting. The main character seems plain and doesn't evolve at all during the movie (I know to cast a child is hard, but they failed hard on that). 
The characters doesn't get the proper deepness they need to the public to feel closer to them (except maybe Rosa and perhaps Rudy), they doesn't walk comfortably in their world, their actions doesn't seem natural and justificated. 
Maybe it was just me, but the accent and the mix of languages doesn't quite fit in, especially considering that they were on Germany and they were on war against English people!, they should just make everyone speak english as if it were a translation (though this is my personal preference)",5,0,0,16 June 2018
