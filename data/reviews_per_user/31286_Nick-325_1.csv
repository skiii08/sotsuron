The Devil's Advocate," A cementing catalyst
","It is my habit to read reviews after I have seen the movie, never to comment. In this case I was compelled to write that which was clearly ignored. I not only saw this movie, but read every review. It was to my surprise that not one person keyed on the excellent supporting role of Ms, Lomax, mother to Kevin Lomax, played by Judith Ivey. Her performance blended so well into the story that it became transparent, yet was an integral part comprising the mosaic to this well shaped thriller.",Null,1,2,16 October 1999
