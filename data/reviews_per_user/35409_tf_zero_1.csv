50 First Dates," cute love flick, great to bring a date to.
","Go see this movie if you want to watch what would happen if they made 'The Wedding Singer : Hawaiian Style'.  Same Sandler/Barrymore/ basic workings, Sandler falls for Barrymore, Sandler thinks twice about it after brief complication, Sandler and Barrymore fall in love. Good film however, very sweet and seasonal (Valentine's Day).  I would go see it again.",9,0,0,13 February 2004
