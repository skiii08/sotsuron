Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A Star Wars for a new generation...
","Well, now that I have seen Star Wars: Episode I twice, I can really register an opinion.  I think that EVERYONE should see it twice before registering an opinion.  I saw it the first time and I was SO excited, I was only mildly impressed.  After seeing it again without the anticipation, I realized that it was a GREAT movie, visually stunning, full of action and fun.  Many people need to remember that this isn't 1977 and this Star Wars wasn't released as part of a trilogy.  No one knew if there was going to be an Empire Strikes Back, the movie was made as a standalone.  It isn't fair to compare Episode IV and Episode I.  Also since Episode I is definitely part of a trilogy, it doesn't answer all the questions, in fact I think it raised more then it answered.  This is good because I am anticipating Episode II and III.  Lucas however did make this movie MUCH more visually stunning then the other three.  It is definitely a Star Wars for a new generation.There were things I absolutely loved about the movie, the fact that the Jedi were as Ben Kenobi said in the first movie, the most feared in the Republic, the fight scenes with Darth Maul were more explosive and energetic.There were things that at first I didn't like but after seeing it a second time, didn't bother me at all.  One was Jar Jar Binks, he was hard to understand and a bit annoying the first time, but when I saw it again he was enjoyable and purposeful.  I also didn't care for the level of comic relief was aggravating.  I think this was because of my expectations.  But again after seeing another time, I enjoyed the light banter and humor.  This IS a movie worthy of the Star Wars name, however it is also definitely a 90's version.All in all I recommend everyone see it.twice.",8,0,0,23 May 1999
