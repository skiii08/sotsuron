It," Great cast, visually stunning, But the movie itself is pretty lame
","I feel like the plot itself was missing components that glue the story line together. The plot itself does not hold the movie together. Luckily, the cast is incredible and the film is full of amazing visual effects. It kept me in my seat. Don't know it I'll bother going to the sequel. I'll have to figure out if the plot is worth the time and money.",6,0,5,25 September 2017
