Hereditary," You Had Me Until the End
","What started as, and through most of the movie, was a film about grief and loss (with a bit of supernatural thrown in), turned into utter crap at the end.It's like this film is made by two filmmakers: one puts a lot of thought into the characters and their development, and one who wants to 'play' and take a dump on such a beautiful creation.I also must say that this is the first time that Gabriel Byrne has turned in a less-than exemplary performance. He comes off as indifferent, cold, and rather impatient with his wife throughout the entire movie. He is actually bordering on unlikeable.The only thing that I can equate this film with is when Axl Rose delivers a stunning vocal performance only to 'f' it up in the end by holding notes too long and sounding utterly ridiculous.I am seriously upset, AND stunned.What WERE they thinking?",6,0,1,26 November 2018
The Happening," A Character Study in Human Nature
","I am going to risk getting flamed and give this movie an EXCELLENT review. Why? Because what everyone hated about this film is exactly what I loved about it. We get so used to seeing larger than life heroes save the day and never break a sweat. We are used to seeing blood, guts, and entrails splattering our screens. People will forgive a weak plot (as many horror movies have) if you give them a big, bloody payoff. This film is not so much about 'the happening' although that part is terrifying and exciting to watch; after all, how many of us are afraid of losing who we are or going insane? This film is about human nature. It is about how humans behave when everything normal is taken away. Yes, there are some awkward acting parts, but I think that this is done on purpose. I prefer to give Mr. Shyamalan the benefit of the doubt because I have said stupid stuff at the most inappropriate times. The fact is that humans are not perfect; humans do not always say the right thing, and humans can be selfish even when other people's lives are at stake. However, people usually do the right thing and come together. It's an excellent character study in human nature.",9,0,2,27 August 2010
Mother!," There Are Things That Should Never Be Done
","This movie does not work on so many levels. There is no way that a crowd would show up at someone's house then simply destroy it, and do all of the horrific things that are shown in this movie.Once the baby was born, I had a bad feeling so I looked up what would happen, and STOPPED watching.Showing a poor baby getting his neck broken, then being cannibalized is something that should NEVER be done for ANY REASON.Some directors think that anything and everything is justified to the sake of art.Well, it is NOT.This is nothing more than torture porn by the end.This is BY FAR, the worst movie I have ever seen. It was doing great until about 40 minutes before the end.If you are sensitive, steer clear of this crap.",1,2,4,10 January 2019
