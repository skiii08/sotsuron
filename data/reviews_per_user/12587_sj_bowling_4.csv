Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Disappointed
","I was very much disappointed in Borat. Any fan of Da Ali G Show will probably agree. I see all this hype built up by people who don't even watch Ali G and don't even know who plays him. Most people don't even know the third character Cohen plays named Bruno. I find the show freaking hilarious because it is completely unscripted and is just Cohen at his finest. Here we have half scripted, half unscripted. I just thought the whole back story concept was actually pretty lame, considering the show is not at all in this format.All in all, I was disappointed in this show, being an Ali G Show purist. If you truly enjoy the show, just stick to it and forget this piece of garbage film. If you want to act all cool and 'fit in', please see it. You will probably like it. Im just hoping we don't see a Bruno movie. This movie will make a lot of money though, so I wont be surprised.And for the record also, people who thought it was bad because he bad mouths Jews, you are ignorant to the fact Cohen himself is Jewish!",1,20,41,5 November 2006
L.A. Confidential," Best movie in 20 years.
","This was not only the best movie of 1997, but probably the last twenty years. It's disgraceful that Titanic won the award for best picture. This film has terrific acting, cinematography, a great screenplay and great character development. The book was phenomenal as well and the film got the stamp of approval from write James Ellroy. Curtis Hanson and Brian Helgeland wrote a great screenplay from the book. This film could have been a disaster, but their terrific screen writing was a testament to a great book.With such a star studded cast which includes Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce, Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger, we see some fine performers practicing their craft at the highest level. If you like a great crime fiction with many plot twists, see this film. I cant say enough about this film, only that it is my favorite film of all time. 10/10",10,5,8,22 January 2007
Batman Begins," Batman is back.
","Batman is back and he means business. That's a very cheesy way to start this review, but it's a fitting one. I loved the Burton Batmans mostly because I'm a big Burton fan and a was a moderate Batman fan. AFter seeing all the junk that Schumacher had made and basically ruined this franchise, people were waiting for the best comic book here to make a return. The Bat nipples, poor choices for Batman and overdone villains ruined every Batman movie up until Begins. Bale is hands down the best Batman as he has the style and posture of the Bat. Please, do yourself a favor and watch this movie. I only felt like I had to write this review in order to get people pumped for The Dark Knight.",9,3,4,23 May 2008
Titanic," When was the ship going to sink?
","This movie is so so overrated. It boggles my mind how this piece of garbage was voted best picture over LA Confidential in 97. The acting in this film is beyond poor, with Billy Zane, yes BILLY ZANE giving the only decent piece of acting in this movie. This movie is comparable to Pearl Harbor, in where we have a historic event get skewed by some sappy, bogus love story about a misunderstood painter. I was surprised and jubilant to find that this movie is out of the top 250 on IMDb as voted by it's users. Thankfully, many other educated users agree with me here.In closing, do not waste your time on this film if you enjoy any realistic movie-making. James Cameron should stick to The Terminator. 2/10",2,6,10,16 January 2007
