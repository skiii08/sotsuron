The Longest Yard," This was an extremely funny good movie.
","The movie was a lot better than I expected it to be. A friend of mine won sneak peek tickets to see this movie today and asked me to come along. Adam Sandler and Chris rock played there roles great. For a PG-13 movie there was an excessive amount of swearing. There of course were definitely something that they could've kept out and weren't all that necessary, but they were great. I wasn't disappointed in the movie at all, and neither was my friend. I would definitely see it again and i am planning on it.The reason I only gave it 9 out of 10 is because this movie could offended some people, with the use of the 'N' word in a derogatory way and there was some racial remarks made. There was also a couple of homosexual slurs and jokes. If it wasn't for these, I would've rated a 10 must see movie.",9,5,18,24 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Wasn't to impressed.
","This movie was better than the second, but way to predictable. Growing up a Star Wars fan I was excited when the production of Episodes I, II, and III were starting. When I saw this movie on the 22, I was disappointed in Mr. Lucas. There was a lot more action then Episode II, but they were way to predictable. In Episode I Mr. Lucas did a GREAT job keeping us on our seats wanting to know what happens next. But in Revenge of the Sith, we knew everything, I actually dosed off a couple of times. If someone asked me to see it with them again, I would, just as long as I'm not paying for it. I believe it was a waste of six bucks and should've waited to see it when it came either to the dollar theater or on DVD. Another plus about this movie is that Hayden Christensen did his best job of acting in this movie, no offense to the kid or anything, I watched Hayden 'grow' from his TV series 'Higher Ground' and he has definitely improved. The graphics were a lot better and it was quite a bit more 'realistic'.If you want to watch a movie that you can just sit back and relax while watching, this is it, or if you just want to complete the series.",7,0,0,25 May 2005
