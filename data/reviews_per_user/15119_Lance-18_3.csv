Antz," Never seen such a good feel-good movie
","The film AntZ is fantastic. I was surprised about the lay out, and the perfect 'type-casting'. Woody Allen is tailor made for AntZ, not to mention Sylvester Stallone for the role of Weaver. Sharon Stone is just bitchy enough for the role of Bala. The dialogues are great, the animation is great, and the jokes aren't predictable at all, as mentioned before by another IMDB member. I read the comment of someone who said that the words 'erotic fantasy' are not suited or appropriate for the five-year old. I think he does not understand it. THIS IS NOT AN ANIMATION MOVIE FOR KIDS, BUT FOR ADULTS!!!!! If you want to have a good night out, start with this movie then. It really won't disappoint you. Oh yeah, by the way. Me, being almost 23, almost had to cry at a certain moment in the movie. This is something Disney has never achieved. Adults who are moved by some animation movie. But this is not just an animation, it is AntZ. It is great. The makers have looked well at the real ants, and inserted that wisdom in the film in a great way. Is this 1000 words yet? I could go on and on about this one.....",Null,0,0,15 February 1999
The Usual Suspects," real good, real suspense
","It is absolutely a smashing movie. I don't think I can go into details, because I have seen it only once. My video is now recording it, so I can have a better look at it.",Null,0,2,30 December 1998
A Clockwork Orange," The best movie ever made
","This one is so good. I really love it. The opening scene got me immediately, then I thought this one is gonna be good. The music in the movie is so brilliant. The ninth symphony, second movement will never be the same again. It always reminds me offthe wonderful bedroom of Alex. The statue of Jesus Christ, the views on the bed, the mirrors, everything. Those mirrors were the reason why I now got mirrors on my closet myself. I read one comment about the language, that is Russian, and I think that is a public secret. The message of the movie is very appealing to me, being a future psych. But the terrific dialogues, the terrific story, the scenario Kubrick made out of the book, (thereby leaving the last chapter away, think that is good), really really make this movie more than worth seeing.",Null,0,0,15 January 1999
