The Legend of Bagger Vance," the legend of murphy's law
","I panned this film in a lengthy review, mocking everything about it- its ridiculously abbreviated telling of the Matt Damon character's backstory, its ridiculous 'I am an old man in the beginning and the end of the film, and the bulk of the movie is my narration of events from my childhood' framing device, the ridiculous Bagger Vance character, the ridiculous golf mythologizing, the ridiculous 'It's the Depression, we need a hero!' stuff, the ridiculous way in which one is never in doubt, for a second, about the very next thing that will happen, the ridiculous attempt to deal with the philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita in a piece of Hollywood cheese about GOLF- I also mocked the movie for seemingly being aimed at the 'ignorant, rich old white person' demographic, as that was the only group I could see enjoying it. I thought my saying I was white would make this statement OK, but maybe not- it was either that statement, my calling the film 'crap', or the general tone of the review, that caused it, alone among the reviews I've submitted to this site, to not be allowed. Or maybe it was the part where I said the film was sort of evil in its stupidity. I did, however, praise Charlize Theron, who was wonderful. Will this review get through? It should. It's honest.",2,1,4,26 October 2007
It's a Wonderful Life," it is
","No other film will make you feel more, or more deeply. No other film will leave you in this state. The immediate effect is something like that of a drug. It leaves you feeling very loving, and very loved, and very grateful. I don't think any other film captures what it is to live, as an emotional experience, so well. Capra was unsophisticated, we're told. His film is unsophisticated, we're told. But there is such a thing as emotional sophistication, and often the other kind serves only to render a man unable to articulate just what life is like, emotionally, how deep the despair and how high the exultation. This movie should be a book of the Bible.",10,1,3,18 October 2007
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," fun, but slight
","Like all the Coen movies it's well-made and beautiful to look at and to listen to. It also has the common Coen problems- it isn't really ABOUT anything, and is kind of shaggy, and seems, once you step back and look at it, to have been primarily a stylistic exercise. But there's beauty and wit here, just the same. The music is well worth remembering. Still, there are nagging feelings- while everything in the movie WORKS, I get the feeling I didn't experience as much beauty here as the brothers intended me to. I only recall feeling chills (for sheer beauty) one time, this in a film with many shots and songs included for beauty alone. This review sounds much more negative than it should, I rather liked the movie. I liked the Babyface Nelson stuff, the joke on local politics, the sirens, the toad, John Goodman beating people with a tree branch- there's plenty to like! But everything is at a distance, or else seems air-light and inconsequential,- for instance even allowing that it's a comedy and, being a Coen Bros film, is a play on style and stereotypes, does the viewer care if Clooney gets his wife and children back? I didn't. Nor do we mind much when it seems Pete has become a toad, nor when we find out he's been put back in a chain gang- nor, more importantly, does the movie seem to care. The only time one feels anything like concern for the characters is when they're about to be hung after having been pardoned- and even then my interest and my thoughts of 'How unfair!' only lasted a second or two. Then I remembered what movie I was watching and thought, 'Oh, it's all so damn lackadaisical.' Anyway, seven points for style.",7,0,0,24 October 2007
