Your Name.," A masterpiece that you should watch
","One of the best animation movie I've watched in a while, and I'm a weeb so that says a lot. Makoto Shinkai somehow manages to make you feel close to the character and somewhat relate to them, so much that I ended up being really happy, really sad, tearing up a little for both those reasons, or thinking to myself 'Please don't end now, please don't end now' in a lot of situations. The drawings are amazing, I had shivers just from looking at the sceneries. The music also is really good, the artists did a really amazing job with that whole aspect, props to them. Shinkai also made the movie seem longer than it actually is even if, in the end, it feels like it's been the longest and shortest 1 hour and 46 minutes ever. Overrall a really good movie, with a really good plot, animations, music, characters, etc... That I would recommend to everyone.",10,3,6,29 December 2016
