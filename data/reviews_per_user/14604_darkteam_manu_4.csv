Frost_Nixon," Quite the history lesson
","'Im saying that when the president does it, that means its NOT illegal!' That sentence lingered in the minds of the audience and David Frost himself I'm sure. Director Ron Howard creates an epic by elaborating on a controversial historic moment -the Frost/Nixon interviews that were taken a little while after President Nixon was impeached. Frank Langella and Martin Sheen were excellently cast as Richard Nixon and David Frost respectively.The movie starts off as we hear excerpts from Nixon's actual Watergate tapes as the credits are rolling; We then see Langellas's Nixon announcing on live television that he will resign the presidency. The story goes from there, as British talk show host David Frost is looking for a big break in his career- something that will make him big bucks, and President Nixon is enjoying 'unemployment' in his home with his financial adviser Swifty Lazar. Frost then has this crazy idea to interview Richard Nixon. After a long while of arguing and mini-conflicts arising, Frost finally gets the interview, and both parties do extensive research on each other, in order to outsmart the other on television- which takes up the bulk of the movie. Thats all I can really say without spoiling anything.An excellently crafted piece, which gives us a ton of information we might not have known on Nixon, whether you are the political fanatic or not. Ron Howard was always good at making his movies entertaining, and he merged fact with fiction to help keep the audience on the edge of their seats throughout most of the movie. With witty humor, and a truly emotional ending, Frost/Nixon has it all. All that mixed with a free history lesson is a pretty good deal for $10.",9,2,4,29 December 2008
Milk," Got milk, anyone?
","Milk tells the tale of supervisor Harvey Milk, a political man who flaunts his sexuality to oppose modern beliefs, and gain his his First Amendment right as he runs for mayor of San Fransisco.Personally I believe that the directing was excellent, and Gus Van Sant truly kept even the straightest of people rooting for Harvey Milk by making his movie so entertaining. Acting was worth a remark as well. Great performances by Penn, Franco, and Hirsch (quite the transformation from into the wild if u ask me). I also learned a thing or two about how gays were treated during the 1970s due to religious and social turmoil.Having said that, I also believe that the 'gay' part of the movie was what completely ruined it. The producers could have done the same exact story with any other minority. A black candidate in an anti-black community, a Muslim candidate in an anti Muslim community, and the list could go on an on. What most people see in a heartwarming, entertaining flick, I see desperation in trying to get the ever-growing gay community to side with this movie. And I'm afraid that might influence certain big-name awards such as the Oscars. Why destroy social and religious values? Simply because the movie was directly aimed at the gay community.Critics are hailing this movie as a 'true American epic'. A true American epic? Do they know what that says about America? To me, it is absolute nonsense, and despite the entertaining theatrical factors the movie possesses, I highly dislike the idea of promoting this certain anti-religion minority in such a way.I also believe that one should learn about history no matter what ethics or rules it opposes. What happened has happened, therefore we might as well learn about it as we cant really change it. And I'm perfectly pleased to learn a history lesson about homosexuals and their troubles during the 70s. Just not while watching Sean Penn and James Franco make out.",6,5,26,2 January 2009
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Doesn't live up to the hype
","After the 3 long hours i spent watching The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, I'm afraid I have to conclude I am a bit disappointed.This movie had so much hype surrounding it, and after all those golden globe nominations I thought this movie was really worth-seeing. I was a bit wrong. It is extremely overrated and I honestly expected more from a possibly Oscar-winning movie.The whole movie tells the story of Benjamin Button, a man who ages backwards. We follow him from the moment he was born, and through all his mishaps and adventures and we watch him get younger while everybody else around him gets older.The plot is interesting, and screenplay, I feel was fairly well written but this is NOT best picture material. I feel Doubt should have been substituted with this movie for the best picture golden globe nomination. Even Brad Pitt's performance was fairly average, he has definitely had better. Frank Langella or Leonardo Dicaprio will probably edge him out on the awards. Screenplay and directing do deserve nominations but there are better movies who will probably win. Make-up however was excellent, and they deserve an award for that.As much as I wish the movie goes home empty-handed on January 11th, and on Oscar night, I doubt the Academy will look over this movie, so I'm afraid I will have to endure a disappointing and frustrating Oscar night.",6,3,9,25 December 2008
There Will Be Blood," There's more than just blood..
","Daniel Day-Lewis delivers an emotionally-draining performance as Daniel Plainview, a California oil tycoon whose greed and visceral need for vengeance allow us to view what is arguably one of the most bone-chilling and emotionally corrupt characters in movie history.This movie was revolutionary in my eyes because of the introduction of a new style of character, and a deviation from the standard movie plot. The film revolves around the life of this character Daniel Plainview and it is an exploration of character above all. It is not the type of movie that will please the majority of movie-goers, and this movie was released around the time of a similarly deviant movie in No Country For Old Men, and most of the plaudits go to the latter.This movie is profound and compelling, it explores a number of themes and it is definitely a movie with a mature aspect to it. I highly recommend seeing a film like this, because although its relative calmness, it is a unique plot, and coming across such a powerful acting performance such as Daniel Day-Lewis' portrayal in this movie will be difficult. It is my personal favorite movie of all time.",10,2,3,23 July 2009
