The Blair Witch Project," the media campaign has been better than the actual movie
","Those who were old enough to witness The Blair Witch Project hitting the theaters would remember the word of mouth propaganda it had. Well, it happened so that shortly after the release i got hold of some movie magazine that explained the marketing campaign behind it. For me, this has been a much better recommendation.However, when i went to see it, The Blair Witch Project turned out to be precisely what it was: A low budget horror thriller with all advantages and disadvantages that come with such description.It is amazing, though, that there have been people convinced that The Blair Witch project has been an actual documentary. And this remained so, even when the authors admitted how claiming this had been a part of their marketing strategy...",2,2,4,18 April 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," same side of the coin
","Discussing which part of Kill Bill is better is fruitless. It is not even talking about two sides of a coin, rather comparing two sides of the same apple. It is one and the same movie cut into two parts. Tarantino was either not willing or not able to produce a scenario that would stretch over three movie.Anyhow, David Carradine basically repeated his role as Kwai Chang Caine, this time with a mane of a haircut. The trademark 'i'll put you all to sleep' voice stayed, though. Uma Thurman is beautiful and offers several touching moments. There are also several interesting details and, all in all, this is a watchable movie.I guess Tarantino did what he always wanted, he filmed a kung-fu movie.",4,1,5,26 October 2013
The Equalizer," nothing special
","The best moment in The Equalizer is roughly one third into the movie where one of the main villains receives a phone call. The camera follows him as he leans back into the armchair and we see his tattoos. As someone has pointed out to me in a conversation, this is where we understand he is a demon against which our hero fights.However, if you know that the hero is Denzel Washington going after Vladimir Pushkin, it all dissolves into a thinly veiled propaganda in which Obama would eventually defeat Putin.I think we don't need to discuss any depth after this point and focus on the fun factor. But even there we're confronted with questionable contents. For example, the aforementioned gentleman wears massive prison tattoos although he spent major part of his life in the military. Also, our hero has a soft spot for girls in trouble. Although trained as an assassin, he prefers everyday objects to execute his opponents.And the most interesting thing is that roughly at the same time a movie with Keanu Reeves came out called John Wick, in which the main character goes after Russian mob. Well, it is not as good as The Equalizer...",3,3,4,1 February 2015
The Expendables 2," much worse than the first part
","There is one significant difference between The Expendables 2 and the first installment: The script has been written by a high school pupil in love with action movies. Otherwise it is the same as all Stallone action flicks since the 1980's, a trend that would probably continue in The Expendables 3. Thanks to the stellar cast and all cameos, Sylvester Stallone might even be hailed as a savior of the 'classical' action film. But we're getting sidetracked...The Expendables was not particularly good, but was watchable, unlike The Expendables 2. After the success of the first part, the writers stopped worrying about physics or limitations of human body. To compensate for that, they filled the script with references on other movies by the same actors, as well as internet jokes about them. The best example is the cameo of Chuck Norris. It goes without saying that these were actually jokes on high school level, because The Expendables 2 probably tried to tap into the audience of the corresponding age.",2,0,1,4 October 2014
John Wick," Matrix downloaded from a non certified torrent server
","The best thing about John Wick are the action sequences because after a while they resemble a modern ballet piece. Otherwise, the plot is worthy of a comic book or a first person video game.So, the main character goes after Russian mob because some of their less intelligent members stole his car and shot his dog. Yes, this is his motivation to turn the rest of the movie into a gore fest. We'll also encounter an underworld of hired assassins that not only have code of conduct and well established hideouts, but also their own currency resembling a gold coin. It's net worth remains ambiguous since for one coin you might enter a club but also dispose of a body by a professional service.The biggest question mark i had about John Wick is what made Keanu Reeves play in this movie. Was it the fading fame, his agents talking him into it or complementary fitness lessons that came with the role.Funny enough, roughly at the same time with John Wick release a similar trashy movie came out, with an underdog fighting the Russian mafia, namely The Equalizer with Denzel Washington.",2,4,11,1 February 2015
Gravity," radio drama plastered over some amazing images
","Movie-going is no chip thrills today, especially if you consider ticket prices. Therefore the average viewer, myself included, wants to get his money worth and see some extraordinary images, preferably in 3D. There were attempts to couple this with what would be considered a powerful story, for example The Tree of Life (2011) and Life of Pi (2012).This time the producers pulled out a story that would resonate with the broadest audience possible and employed everyone's darlings Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. And this works for a while since the protagonists are not encountering zombies, dragons or other mythical creatures, but are astronauts fighting for their lives.However, at a certain point you start questioning the probability, if not the physics of the things you see in Gravity. In order to add to realism sound is mostly unheard but their is music to highlight the emotions which, in turn, reminded me of radio dramas i've heard years ago.Both Bullock and Clooney offer their standard performance. I only hope that real astronauts have more mental stability and better training than Bullock's character in the movie...",5,0,2,12 January 2014
Star Trek," a great reboot of the series
","This was a great SF movie, but i can't give it more than 7 stars. It means it was entertaining, kept my attention without any idle running but was not THAT memorable. However, it was nothing more than an excellent action-packed SF movie.The plot is good and the actors well chosen. Some of them are even resembling the original cast with a cameo appearance of the original Mr. Spock.But the most important thing is that Star Trek fulfills it's purpose. It is not merely a pastime but an excellent reboot of the series. It won't turn you into a Trekkie, though.",7,0,0,24 August 2013
Inglourious Basterds," ego tripping
","If you had doubt about the size of Quentin Tarantino's ego, there should be none after this movie. Not only that he wrote the alternative history of the Second World War, he even adjusted the orthography to fit his needs, naming the movie Inglorious Basterds.But it is not all that bad. Despite it's length, the movie is nice to watch, as it usually is the case with Tarantino's movies. The photography is exquisite, the colors warm and the costumes sitting just right.The cherry on the top is, of course, the performance of Christopher Waltz, in whom Tarantino finally found the adequate mouthpiece for his rants. Although most of the text he speaks is nonsense, i enjoyed each an every second of his act. Moreover, his presence is what makes Inglorious Basterds bearable.Of course, there has been some higher meaning associated with this movie, but i haven't been able to find it even after some pondering.",4,0,1,18 April 2014
World War Z," now, this was a surprise
","I'll be honest, i saw World War Z only because it was in 3D. Another thing that turned me off in advance was that media focused on Brad Pitt's and Angelina Jolie's private life during the movie's release. The rumor has it that the producers feared World War Z didn't offer enough material for the press and opted for this, although Ms Jolie's closest relation to the movie was visiting it's premiere with her husband.Yet all this conditioning was misguiding, because World War Z offers more than enough solid entertainment and serious storytelling. Sure, we're talking about zombie apocalypse unleashed upon mankind and the main character searching the four corners of the Earth for the cure. This premise alone raises questions about the realism and the level of discussion. On the other hand, World War Z shows the consequences of a contagion spreading rapidly across the globe and the consequent dissolution of civilization as we know it.For an apocalyptic action move World War Z is surprisingly well done. The plot held my attention and never turned boring.",6,0,1,8 February 2015
The Hunger Games," an above average SF flick
","The Hunger Games is a nice movie to watch, especially if you're into science fiction.The future world we see is in the movie is bleak. The concept of Hunger Games is particularly disturbing. The games themselves are presented as almost a logical leap forward for today's reality shows. You'll also see some nice CGI and some well done action sequences.I haven't read to book The Hunger Games are based on, but this hasn't bothered me. However, after watching it and realizing that i'll have to endure several more movies before the ending did bother me. Besides, i haven't seen any higher message the media have been droning about.",6,1,5,18 April 2014
Argo," Ben Affleck directorial breakthrough into blockbusters
","Ben Affleck's track record as a director was short and brilliant, so after The Town and Gone Baby Gone i'd been looking forward to his next feature film. However, he is also entitled to pursue his ambition as he sees fit and make a movie like Argo.With this being said, i'll simply ignore the historical background, which was obviously tweaked for the needs of the movie. To realize this, you don't have to do any research or even read Argo's entry on Wikipedia.We're left with an average Hollywood thriller involving some known names and a lot of suspense just where the writers and the director needed them. So, if you're looking some relaxing entertainment, Argo is a fun movie to watch, yet offers nothing new or surprising.",4,1,3,18 January 2015
Star Trek Into Darkness," saved by 3D
","Similar to The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012), Star Trek: Into Darkness is a movie whose plot is overshadowed by viewing pleasure in 3D. Otherwise it would have been another above-average SF flick, especially since we've seen the reboot of the series which set the bar high. So, the only thing settings this movie apart from Star Trek (2009) is the ambitious performance of Benedict Cumberbatch as Kahn.Otherwise, the atmosphere is joyful and laced with action sequences in the vein of the predecessor. This time, however, there are a couple of sub-par.Overall, Into Darkness is an entertaining movie.",6,0,3,24 August 2013
Ed Wood," when cinema surpasses reality
","After all the fuss about Ed Wood being the worst director of all times, it's been a logical choice to see this movie. In retrospect, this movie might be an important contributor to this 'fame'.After reading about Ed Wood's life, i must admit that Tim Burton's effort was one of those movies that painted reality in bright colors, making it much nicer than it actually had been. Ed Wood was genuinely untalented. Perseverance with which he approached film making has been his only true strength. Otherwise he seemed to be unhappy in this life, even according by Tim Burton's movie and Johny Depp's portrayal.One scene stuck with me. After an overdose Bela Lugosi called Ed Wood. He rushed to the scene only to be asked to bring goulash which should supposedly help the incapacitated Bela Lugosi recover.Overall, the movie is not bad. It is rather a question why such fascination with such a character...",5,4,6,29 June 2014
Match Point," one of my Woody Allen favorites
","Woody Allen is amazing in the sense that he writes the same story for decades with slight discrepancies and varying plot twists. Therefore it is no surprise that once in a while these stories would resonate with any viewer. In the case the viewers have the patience to watch them all, that is.Anyhow, Match Point is one of my favorite Woody Allen movies. For some reason it struck a chord, whether it was the circumstances i was in or the situation it depicted.At the time i was interested in business in a broad academic sense of the word. An the fact that a business degree might merely be a ticket to ride the train of the big bucks has been underlined by the movie. The main protagonist enters that world due the fact that someone with a position liked him, not because he has any knowledge about anything relevant.The impending global financial crisis that ensued a couple of years after this movie was one of those moments where viewers might even claim how Woody Allen predicted it all.On a more basic level, the sexual tension between Scarlett Johansson and Jonathan Rhys Meyers and his ambivalence towards Emily Mortimer were depicted amazingly. Otherwise some thoughts on crime and punishment are showcased, a somewhat omnipresent motif in Woody Allen's work.To sum it all up, if you like the movies by the same author, you'd like this one. Otherwise you might be looking for another movie...",7,1,3,26 December 2015
Youth," another mystery of modern cinema
","Youth is one of those movies that makes you ponder about the missing piece of the puzzle that would make it a good film. The cast is perfectly chosen, their performance impeccable and cinematography wonderful. A lot of scenes are like still life paintings brought to screen, although humans are the part of the scenery.Eventually, what was supposed to enhance the atmosphere turned to be the biggest weak spot. The 'important' scenes dragged on forever and made me cherish the dialogue between the cast.Youth is not a bad movie in itself. It simply shows what is considered to be a good art-house movie of today. Essentially it has a lot in common with blockbusters, boasts with stellar cast and impressive cinematography. It lacks the action and substitutes it with emotional tension between the protagonists. And the authors where pretentious as if they were paid by the minute of the final product.It remains a mystery to me how this empty shell of a film became an instant classic on IMDb and would presumably become a cult movie in the time to come.",3,75,144,1 November 2015
Cloverfield," what was all the fuss about?
","Shortly before it's release, it had been hard to miss the online banners, adds and trailers for Cloverfield. And when the day finally came to see it, i felt cheated. In a way, this has been the same feeling of disappointment when watching The Blair Witch Project. The only difference has been that with the latter movie people recommended it.In any case, the premise sounded good and execution looked promising for a couple of minutes. Afterwards we slip into the regular Hollywood action/thriller movie with predictable plot and mediocre acting. I'm not sure whether i should use the word Hollywood, but this is a word associated with movies in which the return of investment counts, not the artistic merit.I've read somewhere that a group of executives or a group of overpaid ladies and gentlemen responsible for the big bucks thought for a long time about the finishing sequences of the movie. Well, a group of gamers would have chosen better plot twists for the price of pizza and a couple of rounds of soft drinks and beer...",2,1,4,18 April 2014
Ready Player One," just another Hollywood movie
","I guess the only thing one might complain about while reading Ready Player One is the authors obvious intention to appeal to its readers. The fact the book found its way to the big screen confirms the assumption he had a capable manager under whose supervision this happened. Nevertheless, while reading it was fun remembering all those games, music and film, in short, all those cultural references of the 1980s.And although the writer was in charge of the script, all those fun moments were removed. The end product is a forgettable Hollywood movie about the underdog saving the world while falling in love with a girl.I can only assume that Steven Spielberg was under pressure from the executives to deliver in terms of return on investment. According to the media reports he succeeded, although not as, for example, Black Panther.",3,3,7,24 March 2019
Dear John," a love story
","Since i don't expect much of any love story i found Dear John a relaxing movie to watch. Also, i don't care much whether the movie was better or worse than the literally template, i prefer to watch it and let it speak for itself.Dear John is a love story involving a beautiful girl and a professional soldier. I guess this story might resonate well also with men, especially those who had some experience in the army. Even if you've served only a mandatory military service, you might relate to a situation where you meet a girl during your summer vacation and think of her in the barracks.Otherwise there's not much i might tell about Dear John.",5,0,0,4 July 2014
The Expendables," same as all other Stallone action movies
","The Expendables is one of the movies Sylvester Stallone has been making since the 1980's. In this sense, The Expendables could be classified as 'what you see is what you get'. There are endless amounts of testosterone, shooting, explosions and other action sequences.And after all has quieted down, Sylvester Stallone would sit in the cockpit of his airplane and sip on a beer while flying his team to a safe haven. There are also some jokes along the way, as a regular staple in such movies.Otherwise there is not much to be said or remembered about The Expendables.",3,1,1,4 October 2014
Interstellar," not as good as everyone is trying to convince you
","Judging by the cast of Interstellar there is a seemingly endless roster of movie stars begging for at least a cameo in Christopher Nolan's movies. But this shouldn't come as a surprise after the success of The Dark Knight trilogy.So what did we have here? A lot of great CGI images and some truly heartbreaking moments. They were joined together by scenes that better fit an SF movie of B provenance. I don't want to go into discussing the scientific and 'scientific' background, but the characters behave as if they were on a somewhat complicated journey to inner Antarctica and not the boundaries of outer space.The launch of Interstellar is partly a lesson in contemporary communication. Even before it's premiere the media fanfare determined that Interstellar would be a masterpiece. For some reason everyone follows without questioning the sloppy moments.",4,5,10,24 December 2014
Pacific Rim," nothing but CGI
","The current note 7,1 for Pacific Rim on IMDb.com is another example that new generations are writing the history of cinema or at least the reviews.On the positive note, the effects are superior and there are some reference to Godzilla and H.P.Lovecraft. On the other hand, there is nothing memorable about the plot apart from several CGI sequences. But even they were interesting only if you're into special effects. All members of the crew offer sub-par performance. At times it seemed as if some of them weren't even trying to act but rather spout the lines in front of the camera.",3,5,9,5 January 2014
Captain America: The First Avenger," for those who are looking for fun in movies
","I've seen Captain America: The First Avenger as the last in a string of movies based on comic books. And it was the one that prompted me to make a break from such movies.Captain America: The First Avenger offers nothing beside CGI and action. Chris Evans' character qualifies for the ultimate dude with the body of a demigod and little brains, which seems to be the norm in such movies.I'm not even sure what the authors' goal was apart from return on investment. I'm obviously not the right audience, but even when i watch movies for fun i expect my intelligence to be at least remotely tackled, which obviously didn't happen here.",2,1,1,24 December 2014
American Hustle," forgettable
","American Hustle has truthfully recreated the atmosphere of 1970's. Yet, after twenty minutes or so, i lost the interest in what went on on-screen.Essentially, American Hustle is a movie about con-men and their endeavors. Despite the setting, the outfits and the performance of the cast, there is nothing new in this movie.An interesting statistical thing is that on a lot of occasions the characters repeat their lines after they've spoken them. This was probably an attempt to underline the drama of the situation but quickly became just another annoying thing about American Hustle.",4,2,4,29 June 2014
Incendies," amazing movie
","Incendies is another movie you accidentally discover which makes the enjoyment even greater. The topic it covers is far from pleasant, though.We follow twins, brother and sister, who should solve a mystery surrounding their mother after her death. In search for answers they travel to Middle East and their mother's homeland. Before starting her life anew in the West, the mother lived in an environment ravaged by civil war.The twins are to discover more about their mother, but we're to see that no one stays unharmed by war.",8,0,3,18 April 2014
Fargo," (n)ice
","When i first saw Fargo it seemed to be very short, which might be attributed to it's 98 minutes running time. In the long run, it turned out to be the Coen brothers' best effort.If you want to relax, simply switch your brain off and enjoy the movie. Fargo is considered to be a masterpiece, but i'd name it an above-average movie. It's might not surpass the notoriety of Barton Fink (1991) or the fame of The Big Lebowski (1998) and the Academy Award winning boredom called No Country for Old Men (2007) yet it is fun to watch.If you want to analyze Fargo, you won't get far. The characters are one-dimensional and the humor is actually 'humor' yet the Coen brothers restrained themselves more than in, say, Barton Fink.",6,0,1,15 April 2014
Watchmen," the intro was great, the rest not so
","The introductory credits sequence for the movie Watchmen was amazing. It could be that i liked it because i like comic books, as well as the stories with alternate history. The rest was interesting, but only for comic book aficionados. The others might have had problems in staying awake.The reason for initial excitement and later disappointment lays in the story itself. Back in the day when Watchem appeared, the story has been rather interesting. But so many years later it is just one of many comic books brought to screen and one of many alternate histories presented to the broader audience.This combination was still potent, yet the complicated plot demanded a slow pace which, in turn has been simply too slow.",4,7,9,5 July 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," a dream come true
","When i heard that The Lord of the Rings would be brought to screen i was very excited, especially since i've seen the 1978 animation movie. Back in the day the trilogy hasn't been finished which wouldn't happen again.This is one of the rare occasions that a long anticipated movie fulfills it's expectations. Moreover, it set the such high standards for epic fantasy that it took a decade for them to be surpassed by The Game of Thrones (2011) TV show.If you haven't red J.R.R. Tolkien's book, you'd be taken by the world you'll discover in The Fellowship of the Ring. And if you have, i think you wouldn't mind any discrepancies from the literally template.However, the positive review concerns only the first part of the trilogy.",10,0,0,19 May 2013
The Matrix Revolutions," flogging a dead horse
","The last part of The Matrix Trilogy is something of a letdown, sort of a climax that got postponed for too long, thus limiting viewers satisfaction. It is clear that the good guys will win, but we knew that at the moment when the production of The Matrix Reloaded and The Matrix Revolutions has been announced.And as the experience teaches us, the only way to top a blockbuster is to invest more in special effects. Thus we get a firework of action, with a story which still holds. However, at a certain point the receptors get overstimulated and effects seem to be introduced for their own sake. Also, some sequences looked like intro for PC games of the era. CGI animation hasn't been as mature as today, yet that was not a valid excuse.",4,1,2,30 April 2013
Man of Steel," so far the most visually compelling Superman movie
","Visually, Man of Steel has been the most compelling movie about Superman so far. Only visually.There were numerous quasi-emotional scenes, for example the death of Superman's adoptive father. But this is something i'd expect of such a movie.The second thing that bothered me was the CGI. Thanks to it, we've never seen Krypton to such detail. Also, this is the closest we could get to the realism of fights between superhumans. However, the latter scenes dragged on forever and were on such scale that after a while i got numbed and disinterested. After seeing a couple of buildings being crushed by humanoids they all looked the same.On the one hand, i'm glad about this reboot. On the other hand, the series of movies that will follow would probably be filled with action and dumbed-down scripts. But i might be too demanding about the movies based on comic books.",3,0,3,26 December 2015
Silver Linings Playbook," one more question mark
","Silver Linings Playbook is one of those movies that explore mental conditions. For some reason, these movies have more weight than 'other' movies and are usually used to prove actors abilities. And this is exactly what happened here.The main characters were portrayed by Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence. They both deliver fine performance, yet not very memorable, as critics in awe would like us to believe. For example, Bradley Cooper running around wearing a plastic bag presumably actually happened in real life cases, but didn't work out for me.The plot might have been realistic, yet it simply failed to engage me. Despite all this, Silver Linings Playbook is not a bad movie, it rather hasn't been exceptionally good.",4,3,7,29 June 2014
Collateral," i laughed for the better part of the movie
","The only thing that really stuck in my memory about Collateral is the suit Tom Cruise was wearing. Actually, i bought a similar one some time down the line.The movie has an intriguing start yet quickly proves to be a poor script backed by substantial budget. Or maybe i had too high expectations... Anyhow, i quickly forgot that i'm watching what should be a suspenseful thriller and perceived it as bad comedy. I laughed through the rest of the movie which might have disturbed the other viewers in the theater. Sorry about that.Jamie Foxx offers his standard performance and saves the world from Tom Cruise. The latter had one of those roles that should display his skills but are superfluous due to poor script, unlike in, for example Minority Report (2002). Jada Pinkett Smith was there, as well, but was a side role, in true sense of the word.",2,1,5,6 November 2013
No Country for Old Men," no Award winning material in this one
","When i was a child i believed that winning an Academy Award meant something. Then i grew up and some time down the road i saw No Country For Old Men.There wouldn't have been a movie hadn't it been for the insecurity of the main character in the beginning. However, it was still possible to argue that people tend to make irrational decisions even when they know they are wrong or harmful. Then the plot went on and it was clear that script was written without the intention to lead us anywhere.Xavier Bardem saved the day with his performance, but even that was not enough to explain the number of Academy Awards this movie garnered. I mean, it was a decent retro thriller but not a masterpiece everybody praises.",3,2,9,24 August 2013
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Tolkien, as seen through CGI
","There is nothing wrong with CGI. There is nothing wrong with action movies, even when they are written as epic fantasy. Yet, it seems that this 'episode' of Hobbit aims at the audience that isn't very demanding.If you enjoy endless action-packed sequences with a lot of special effects, this might be a movie for you. But if you want to see Tolkien's book brought to screen, even the 1977 animation movie is better choice than Peter Jackson's effort.Essentially, this movie can be described as Peter Jackson's King Kong (2005) that meets Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy (2004) in a world imagined by J.R.R. Tolkien. The Lord of the Rings trilogy set the bar high, but this movie didn't even try to reach it...",4,5,7,27 December 2013
Batman Begins," a powerful reboot
","Prior to watching Batman Begins i had my doubts. However, they were dispersed in that movie theater. This is a great reboot of the franchise. I particularly like the way it had been made realistic and closer to reality.Of course, we still stay in the realm of fiction, but Batman's gear and vehicles are just a step beyond what you'd see in a typical action flick, even a James Bind movie.The layer that elevates Batman Begins from your average comic book hero is a vague social message. Yet, i didn't think much about it and proceeded watching Bruce Wayne dealing with the bad guys.",6,1,1,18 April 2014
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," i guess we got spoiled by The Lord of the Rings
","I remember how bringing The Lord of the Rings to the screen proved difficult due to the sheer quantity of material offered in the literary template. The trilogy was a logical choice, yet even then a lot of condensing was needed.In that sense, i was surprised to hear that The Hobbit would be a trilogy, as well. I mean, how to you stretch a booklet to three feature films? After all, movies are not made purely for our viewing pleasure, but to make money and feed millions working in the film industry.In the end, the first Hobbit movie is good fun. There are some obvious fillers, some of the action sequences being among them. Watching in 3D is recommended, otherwise it might be too long to sit through. I guess we simply got spoiled by The Lord of the Rings and it is hard to top that experience now.",6,1,4,20 April 2013
Before Sunset," very good, but not as good as the prequel and the sequel
","Before Sunset was good but a slight letdown after Before Sunrise. As a standalone feature there would have been no issues. It picks up where the previous movie has ended, although a decade later, but leads us towards an obvious development and finale.Nevertheless, this is an excellent movie, although not the one i'd watch over and over again. As in the prequel, this is more or less one uninterrupted dialog. Since the protagonists have aged, their discussions are more mature. If you've seen all three installments, including Before Midnight, the thing you'd probably appreciate the most is the way their discussions develop.It seems that the authors meticulously planned the script. At certain points you'd feel almost as in a psychoanalytical session.",6,0,0,18 April 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," so far the best Wes Anderson movie
","Movies by Wes Anderson are an acquired taste. I wouldn't call myself a fan, but i enjoyed some of his previous creations, although i wouldn't recommend them to everyone. In this sense The Grand Budapest Hotel is his most mainstream movie which aspire to be more than a comedy.As it usually is the case, we're following a motley crew of characters. Situated in Central Europe they tell their stories of love, lust and fraud. Only at the end of he movie i've seen that it had been inspired by writings of Stefan Zweig. I dare say, Wes Anderson successfully transplanted Stefan Zweig's longings from The World of Yesterday (Die Welt von Gestern) from pre-WWI into pre-WWII surroundings.The Grand Budapest Hotel speaks not only to alternative movie aficionados but also anyone looking for a pleasant cinematic time. It never turns mundane and communicates to a broader audience, although it stays firmly rooted in the domain of weird.",7,0,2,3 February 2015
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," who complained about the 2001 movie?
","Rise of the Planet of the Apes is more than a prequel. It brought the Planet of the Apes franchise to a new level.The special effects are better than anything in the Planet of the Apes universe. They effortlessly surpass the 2001 movie by Tim Burton.The script is better than for any movie before Tim Burton's effort, but falls way short of his movie. At the same time the script got adjusted to the average viewer's taste. Some synthetic emotional moment have been generated, mostly targeting animal loving audience.The rest are action sequences.Overall, Rise of the Planet of the Apes was a tad long for my taste.",3,0,3,26 December 2015
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," kung-fu with a romantic story
","When Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon came out i've been fanatically into fitness. Watching fighters flying across screen seemed like a reasonable outcome of the right exercise boosted by mediation, despite being physically impossible, at least at the current stage of human evolution.The movie offered a good story, albeit slightly melodramatic. And the overall production quality was impressive, to say the least.Then i talked to some people from China and it turned out that Wuxia is a well established movie genre merging kung-fu action with romantic stories. For them Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon was neither fresh nor special, rather a mainstream introduction of the genre to the Western audience.Nevertheless this is an excellent movie.",10,0,0,8 March 2014
Django Unchained," 21st century entertainment
","After Django Unchained it became clear that Quentin Tarantino has been on his way to make movies in every genre he liked while working in the video rental in his early days. Just think of this sequence: Kill Bill, Death Proof, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained.Anyhow, the photography has been wonderful again, the colors warm and the actors dressed smart. The script is Tarantino's ego tripping and leading nowhere, but there have been enough splatter scenes to keep the audience amused. Christopher Waltz has been great again, the rest of the cast less so.And there we reach the same old mystery surrounding Tarantino's work. An army of connoisseurs tried to explain the higher plane of his output. In the case of Django Unchained, the message is supposedly anti-racist and elevated to the level of some ultimate anti-slavery pamphlet. Strange, since from his interviews i understood that Quentin Tarantino has been a movie buff and has been making movies that he himself would like to watch. I haven't been able to detect any higher meaning there...",2,5,9,18 April 2014
Drive," a remake that pretends it isn't a remake
","Drive was somewhat slow and pretentious but had nice moments, as well, and the gory scenes of violence are not the ones i mean.It was a surprise, though, that the first 15 minutes were almost copy-pasted from the Driver (1978). So, my issue with Drive is that i wondered which movies i haven't seen or remembered that are potentially a part of it.I guess such an approach is good when you want to avoid producing a remake. You simply take the best parts (or the ones you like the best) from favorite movies of your childhood, put them together and claim you're re-imagining all those stories. And if enough people read in some higher sense in it, you've got your masterpiece.",6,1,2,18 February 2013
Hellboy," partially good
","Having no previous knowledge about Hellboy, i was open for everything when i went to the theater. The result was halfway good.The movie opens brilliantly, the story develops well, fusing fact and fiction. Then roughly in the middle of it, it all becomes just another Hollywood action flick with special effects. If i remember right, the precise moment is entering the cemetery in Moscow while searching for Rasputin.Not sure why this was the case, but it seems as if the producers wanted to showcase all CGI available at the time. Surely they wanted to impress the audience, they probably needed to top some other movie of the era and market research told them they needed bigger and better special effects to do that.The result is good fun, but also makes you forget Hellboy at the moment the end credits start rolling.",4,0,1,2 May 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," a prelude to a mediocre finale
","The Two Towers is where The Lord of the Rings trilogy reared its head. The excitement about the first movie wore off a bit due to a year's wait until the release of the second installment. It was still romantic and epic, as you would expect as a proper movie based on J.R.R. Tolkin's book.However, there were elements of a regular Hollywood blockbuster which would eventually get hold of the third movie. The battles are becoming larger, the special effects grander, yet they were still well balances with superior plot in order to capture my attention. The merit for latter goes to Tolkin, though, not to writers who managed not to get carried away.In The Two Towers we were still in a magical world with some dark changes. The characters are multi-layered and are developing as the dark menace of Mordor is slowly unraveled. There were some twists and surprises, but also we knew that there was one more movie to go until the ending.",7,0,1,19 May 2013
Million Dollar Baby," a good drama
","It seems that a US movie qualifies as 'a serious drama' if it has a difficult topic, follows unhappy characters and lacks a happy ending. Million Dollar Baby wasn't that simple and straightforward, although this might be used as general guidelines when talking about it.Clint Eastwood plays a boxing trainer long past his prime and Morgan Freeman plays his old buddy. there is more that bonds them than meets the eye, but you'll discover some interesting detail during the movie. Hilary Swank offers a solid performance of a lady coming from the bottom of the society who discovers some talents she didn't even dream about.What bothered me, however, was that the writers decided to fill the script with seemingly endless sequence of misfortunes.",6,0,2,20 March 2014
Mulholland Drive," who needs movies that need explaining?
","Mulholland Drive is a turning-point of David Lynch's work. My impression is that it is the last movie in which he cared about the contents. The narrative is non-linear, but at least there is a story, not abstract muddling as in Inland Empire, for example.The surrealism of Mulholland Drive has been it's main attraction and the biggest issue at the same time. The characters change appearance, bodies and even come back from the dead. But after a while this seems to be thinly veiled lack of story development.David Lynch has refused to comment on the movie's meaning. This might have been a sign that there were symbols to be deciphered. On the other hand it might have meant that there was no meaning behind Mulholland Drive.In any case, this movie will be remembered in the history of cinema, so it is up to the viewers to determine what it intended to say.",5,0,5,3 March 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," kung-fu meets crime thriller and western
","Every time someone explains how good Kill Bill was, i remember what happened when i told a Chinese colleague how much i liked Crouching Tiger, hidden Dragon (2000). What was exciting for me was for him just another wuxia film merging kung-fu with a love story.True to himself, Tarantino merged kung-fu motives with crime thriller and, to certain extent, western. Love story was relevant only for viewers who believe that love must hurt and in Kill Bill that is rather literal.The result is a watchable movie that is mostly interesting. As it is the case in most of Tarantino work, this was not the one i'd like to see again. It is not the violence that turns me off, but a lack of message and the hype that surrounds it.",4,2,4,26 October 2013
Clash of the Titans," good story is paramount
","Clash of the Titans goes to show the importance of a good story for a movie, even if it is a couple of thousands of years old. Of course, if you're awaiting an ancient Greek myth brought to screen you'd be disappointed.As far as i understood there has been a whole genre called sword-and-sandal or similar which were basically historical epics. I even remember seeing several of those as a child, at a time when The Lord of the Rings has been merely fantasy aficionado's literature. Although old, they have definitely offered stories different from my ordinary movies at a time, despite the outdated special effects.Given the strong story you might expect that contemporary CGI might help improve the viewers' experience, but you'd be just partially right. CGI is superb in Clash of the Titans, yet we've seen a whole bunch of it when the aforementioned The Lord of the Rings turned mainstream, thanks to Peter Jackson's adaptation. And all the mythical creatures are but a fraction of the fauna populating the worlds we've seen afterwards.Eventually, we've been left with a Hollywood blockbuster full of half-witted dialog and superior CGI.",4,0,0,30 March 2014
The Dark Knight," still good
","I guess we all knew that there will be another installment of the trilogy when we watched The Dark Knight. Or at least, we hoped for it. And i think it is the main problem of such movies, since despite their qualities you perceive them as an interlude to the grand finale.As far as the atmosphere is concerned, the same gritty feeling of Batman Begins is there. The tempo with which the characters, both heroes and the villains, have been introduced makes The Dark Knight rather a drama than a comic book brought to screen.I guess the decision of the authors has been to create something monumental and they've been successful in that, especially if you consider the running time.",6,0,2,18 April 2014
Into the Wild," questionable message
","I've seen Into the Wild without prior knowledge of the topic apart from the fact that Sean Penn directed it. Therefore my review is based on what i've seen and not what i've learned while researching afterward.Sean Penn has always been known as a rebel, sometimes with and sometimes without a cause. Christopher McCandless, the main character of the movie, was hardheaded, as well, which presumably caught his attention.The movie has been made during George W. Bush's second term as President of the United States. Sean Penn has been dissatisfied with his administration and very vocal about it. Therefore there might be a cryptic message that people like Christopher McCandless built the United States. They were valiant individuals (and individualists) who gave their best to fulfill their dreams of a better life. And what time is better to send this message than before the elections...Despite art-house ambition, Into the Wild is rather mainstream in it's essence. The main character travels across the United States and even changes several lives on his way. Although i wouldn't agree with his relation to reality the movie was still watchable.However, at the moment when Christopher McCandless moves into the wilderness, the message of the movie became questionable. He didn't only go without a map, but almost without provisions. Yet, it was still his choice to do so. But the movie goes one step further and implies that it is alright to pursue your dreams, even if you put your life in danger.The soundtrack by Eddie Vedder fits wells into the movie, although i'm no fan of his and wouldn't listen to it again.",2,4,5,16 May 2013
Elysium," District 9 goes to Hollywood
","When i've heard that Neill Blomkamp would direct a movie with Matt Damon set in a dystopian future, it was a must see. However, after watching it, i understood once again that there is much mot to film than meets the eye. As if the producers took the concept of District 9 and set it into a favela and dumbed down the concept of a bad-bad-bad corporatocracy providing good life to the happy few and misery to the poor majority has been considerably dumbed down.Elysium is not a bad movie in itself, rather it hasn't fulfilled it's potential. On the positive note you'll see a lot of good non-US actors: Sharlto Copley, Alice Braga, Diego Luna and (my favorite in this cast) Wagner Moura.Overall, this is a fun movie to watch, but don't expect too much.",4,0,2,4 October 2014
Avatar," a new sort of visual experience
","Avatar set a new standards for movies even beside the SF genre, in the same way that Matrix had done a decade earlier. Watching Avatar in 3D has been one of rare occasions when cinema theater turned into a place of magic.Whether you like James Cameron's output or not is of lesser importance here. The whole industry and millions of fans awaited this release and he fulfilled the expectations. Avatar was obviously made to be seen in 3D and the world (or worlds) depicted in it are spectacular.As far as the story is concerned, things haven't been as exciting as the visuals. A lot of people claim there had been some kind of higher message in Avatar. The only one i might think of is the guilt about the treatment of North American Indians by the authorities of what today is their homeland. Otherwise this has been another SF thriller with a lot of nice action scenes.",6,0,0,9 March 2014
Grindhouse," trailers were better than the movies
","I had the opportunity to see Grindhouse in its entirety. And i was grateful it happened at home since it turned out that the spoof trailers between Death Proof and Planet Terror were the best part of it.Death Proof would have went below any movie goer's radar hadn't it been directed by Quentin Tarantino. It was plain boring. I wouldn't be able to repeat Planet Terror was nice in it's own right if you like horror films. Otherwise it was a trashy flick which generally went unnoticed because Tarantino directed the other movie.Overall, Grindhouse wasn't total crap only because it was produced with an A-movie budget, i.e. moving pictures had nice colors.",3,0,3,4 March 2014
Mama," as far as horror can get
","There were two reasons i watched Mama: The fact that Guillermo del Toro was associated and the main cast. However, del Toro's involvement quickly turned out to be a small scale farce, since he was only one of the producers. So, i was left with the cast and the story.Jessica Chastain shows again an enviable ability to transform herself. And all Game of Thrones fans will be glad to see Jaime Lanister... i mean Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, playing two characters.The atmosphere is dark and the scene that should frighten you will be really frightening. Otherwise we're encountering the the typical story about a curse that has to be broken. Meanwhile, our heroes will be harassed by a ghoul.I'm no big fan of horror (anymore), so i'd just say that Mama plays in the same league as, say, the Scream franchise or the Ring (both Japanese and US versions). Its significance for the genre might be below them, but it is a good horror movie.",5,1,3,2 May 2013
Reservoir Dogs," very good first movie
","When Pulp Fiction (1994) came out the aficionados explained how it was too commercial and that in Reservoir Dogs one could experience 'the true Tarantino'. They were right, although a lot of viewers felt cheated.It turned out that Tarantino used a model he would repeat to this day: Employ a strong crew, offer a story with some extreme violence and wrap it up with a great soundtrack. But there was one more thing. He had the ability to compile the scenes from his favorite movies and spice them with well-written dialogs. You may like his movies or not, yet they are entertaining to watch.The rest is history, as people like to say. Tarantino succeeded in introducing violence to mainstream audiences on unprecedented scale.",4,0,2,6 November 2013
"Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom"," hell on earth
","There are a few movies i've seen that left me absolutely speechless and Salò is one of them. Attributing a number of stars to it would be misleading since it goes to the extremes that are not covered by your regular scale.Without doubt what we see on screen in Salò is pure evil. On the other hand, someone said that the world we live in is so complex, that there are numerous paths to understanding it. In an era in which Susan Sontag has seen Marquis de Sade as an early free speech advocate, there had been no reasons to prevent Pier Paolo Pasolini from making a movie liked this. Therefore my question would be why he did it.I see a couple of possible motives. The first is to show the realities of a tyrannical regime, but there had been other less revolting means to do that. The other is to create a movie that would be watched in specific 'afficionado' circles. In that latter case the only thing separating Salò from your average SM movie is the quality of production. Or maybe Pier Paolo Pasolini simply told a story about himself.",Null,0,1,9 March 2014
Pulp Fiction," nomen est omen
","When Pulp Fiction hit the theaters it had an incredible word-of-mouth recommendation. And Palme d'Or cemented its reputation. Bear in mind, it was before internet was relevant and watching movies online was possible. Therefore it was a must see. And after the movie i was satisfied but also asked myself self: Was that it?Some years down the line i've seen more contemporary TV shows from the US and it became clear why Pulp Fiction stood apart. As the title suggest it is a pulp novel brought to screen, done brilliantly, if you accept there is an extraordinary way to do a below-average thing. Why the critics saw a masterpiece in it is hard to explain, but it simply isn't. There were other things where Pulp Fiction excelled. For example, the soundtrack became an inevitable part of any CD collection at the end of the 20th century.The way i understood Tarantino after watching some interviews, he is a movie buff and makes movies he always wanted to see. Although not the only to try this approach, he is one of the lucky few that made a living out of it.Overall, Pulp Fiction is an exercise in marketing. The title, as well as author's statements, suggest it is an entertaining movie. However, a lot of people read higher meaning into it, elevating it's reputation to being one of the best movies of all times.",6,8,17,25 August 2013
Thor," as far as a comic book could get
","Thor was the last in a series of comic books brought to screen i've seen within a relatively short time frame. It turned out to be among the best of them and the reason might be Kenneth Branagh directing it. Not that the movie breaks the mold of the genre, it just has a good atmosphere when dealing with the inhabitants of Asgard and supernatural creatures they're fighting.However, Kenneth Branagh didn't have a particularly demanding task. When depicting Asgard and the realms of the other side, he heavily relied on his Shakespearean background. The scenes on this Earth are a mixture of thriller and action movies. And as every such movie Thor needs a large fight, similar to the end of a level in any video game, if you know what i mean. Thus, Thor confronts a large monster as seen in numerous Japanese monster movies or even in Beastie Boys' video for Intergalactic.The cast deliver a solid performance, with Chris Hemsworth being a prefect choice for arrogant and blunt Thor. I'm curious whether he'll be typecast for the rest of his career.All in all, this movie is fun, but don't expect more than that from it.",5,2,5,2 May 2013
The Matrix Reloaded," where were we?
","As far as production is concerned, there are some similarities between The Matrix and Star Wars. The Matrix reloaded doesn't feel like a standalone movie, in the same way The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and The Return of the Jedi (1983) seem to be a movie cut in two parts. However, Parts 2 and 3 of The Matrix trilogy came out within the same year, which was obviously an advantage.In any case, the story of The Matrix Reloaded is still strong, yet the problem is that after watching the trilogy, i tend to remember the first part only. The effects are bigger which doesn't necessarily mean that they were better.Overall, this movie is not bad but it had a challenge that it didn't master: It is not better than the first part of the trilogy.",4,0,3,30 April 2013
Love Actually," made me appreciate romantic comedy
","A long time ago i went to see Love Actually only to indulge a certain lady. It turned out it's been one of those romantic comedies that captured the essence of the genre. Not only that i went out of the theater in good spirits, i've seen it several times since with repeated satisfaction.So what is this movie about? Obviously, the title explains it all and might even summarize the plot. It tells several love stories and covers more or less all variations. Yet the best thing with Love actually is that it vibrates with positive energy without becoming cheesy, stupid or vulgar.",10,1,2,23 December 2014
12 Years a Slave," an excellent movie
","After watching Steve McQueen's Shame (2011) my expectations from 12 Years a Slave were rather low. The heist surrounding it during the Academy Awards didn't help. Well, i must admit i was wrong. 12 Years a Slave is an excellent movie.From what i knew about the period and circumstances, i'd say tat 12 Years a Slave offers a reasonable level of historical and factual accuracy. The story of slavery is hopefully well known, but what makes this movie even more horrific is the fact the main protagonist has been kidnapped as a free man and sold to slavery.There were two things, though, that disturbed me slightly.One is the depiction of violence. I understood that this as merely a depiction of reality. Yet it felt as if 12 Years a Slave followed a trend in contemporary cinema where graphic violence seems to be a regular staple in every movie with artistic aspirations.The other thing was a rather superficial case against the legal system of the era. It allowed the slavery to flourish and the violence against slaves was merely its byproduct. Just as an example, the main protagonist failed to achieve anything through legal action against the people who kidnapped him. And this happened in those 'progressive' parts of USA.However, these two things were small in comparison with the rest of the movie.",7,0,1,15 November 2015
There Will Be Blood," let's watch something else, please
","There Will Be Blood was seen as a strong competitor at Academy Awards with No Country For Old Men, which was the reason to see these movies. After i've been disappointed with both it once again confirmed the irrelevance of Oscars and IMDb rating.Daniel Day-Lewis offers a tremendous performance, yet this is a default for any movie he's been in. So, no surprise there. Paul Dano was rather weak and the rest of the crew bearable.Yet, the main issue was the ambition of Paul Thomas Anderson to create a monumental piece of art. 158 minutes of length only confirm my assumption.Sorry, but i have really nothing to add about There Will Be Blood.",3,6,11,2 November 2014
Edge of Tomorrow," Groundhog's Day meets Starship Troopers
","I'm not sure whether my review contains spoilers, because already after watching the trailer you'd get a feeling that Edge of Tomorrow could be summed up as 'Groundhog's Day meets Starship Troopers'. I can only assume that the producers opted for sticking to the original story, be it manga movie or a comic book, instead of developing it further.But even after these remarks, Edge of Tomorrow is a fun SF movie to watch. I won't be returning to it, although i did laugh out loud a couple of times. The main actors deliver a performance adequate for such an artistic effort. Emily Blunt was too skinny for my taste, though.",4,5,12,4 October 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," money and power as a measure of success in life
","After watching The Departed (2006) and Shutter Island (2011) i though that Martin Scorsese got a grip on himself. Well, i was wrong. The Wolf of Wall Street was a platform for profanities in an attempt to prove that money is the only measure of all things in life. The box office performance might speak against my opinion, though.I can only assume that the target group for this movie were the people conditioned by watching reality television. They probably think that Jackass was funny, The Hunger Games had revolutionary potential and Marvel/DC comic books adaptations were cinematic masterpieces. And when this audience gets out of the theater they might dream of becoming the wolves of Wall Street when they grow up, either literally or spiritually. After all, money and power are what matters in this universe.If they get lucky in that dream space, they might strike a deal with the authorities for shorter jail terms for money laundering or whatever fraud they were up to. During the sentence they would write an autobiography and become famous. And with some luck, this would be brought to screen by a renown director.",3,1,3,3 June 2014
The Green Mile," interesting but too long
","Presumably on the tide of success of The Shawshank Redemption (1994), the producers decided to bring The Green Mile to the big screen. It used the same prison framework and expanded it with some supernatural elements. Actually, Stephen King did that in his writing which got transfered to the silver screen.While watching i encountered the same problems as in the other movie which actually stem from the literally template. Writing about supernatural is Stephen King's forte but anything which is even close to portraying actual events feels fake to me. In the same way one wouldn't put an equal sign between a strawberry and a strawberry flavored chewing gum.The combination of the supernatural and harsh prison reality was interesting to watch, although the former has been obviously not possible and latter fake. In it's ambition to be something of the extraordinary the movie got too long.",5,1,2,26 October 2013
The Reader," notorious for all the wrong reasons
","At the time of it's release The Reader caused considerable controversy which clouded its qualities. Everyone was upset about nudity and sex, as well as the alleged glorification of the Nazis, yet little has been said about the qualities of the movie. The advantage of writing this review today is that we can take a step back and talk about the movie itself.In my opinion, The Reader is an exploration of guilt and shame. It addresses the situation in which any of us might think what we should or shouldn't have done. Given the historical context, namely Second World War in Germany, this becomes a potent dilemma to ponder over.A considerable part of the cast plays SS-personnel and shows them as they were: Ordinary people who made their choices under extraordinary circumstances. Obviously they haven't chosen wisely. But it is worthy mentioning that the victors write the history. Had Germany won, the SS-members would have been the heroes of the fatherland. So their choice was partially a gamble which didn't pay out.But there is another plot line. The main character in his youth meets a lady and they engage in a sexual relationship. From today's perspective the lady would have been exposed as a child molester. However, after WWII there has been a shortage of men in all countries involved, a fact that helps understand this escapade.The cast delivers a solid performance. Overall, this is an excellent movie.",7,0,0,23 March 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," better than Hobbit, Part 2
","After the previous installment of the Hobbit trilogy my expectations were rather low. Since i've seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy, it was beyond doubt that the final movie about Bilbo's journey would be an endless battle scene. Basically, the title summarizes the script in six words: The Battle of the Five Armies.However, the authors proved me slightly wrong. There has been some character development, in particular Thorin (Richard Armitage). But even those moments are mere distractions from the aforementioned battle of the five armies.However, my main complaint is of pure technical nature. I've seen the movie in 3D, more precisely described as 3D HFR 48 HPS which, in turn, should convince the moviegoers about the quality of material displayed. And it turned out that during the first half hour all shots with Bard (Luke Evans) were of visible lower quality. Where everything else has been in proper 3D, his shots were almost as from an early 3D simulator. Not sure whether it was due to the equipment in the theater i visited or the producers decided to save some money on shooting with Luke Evans.Otherwise, this movie follows in it's predecessors' steps and you'll get your money's worth of CGI. There is also a hilarious homage to Frank Herbert's The Dune, courtesy of Peter Jackson, but i'll let you guess where and what that might be.",5,2,6,23 December 2014
Inception," dream within a dream within a dream
","I guess there are some drawbacks in having been around when Matrix came out and remembering the revolution it stirred up. Since then i inevitably think about it when a movie tries to tackle the boundaries of reality. In this sense, the best thing about Inception is that it came out more than a decade after Matrix, thus allowing the critical mass of new viewers to grow up and embrace it without much prior knowledge of cinema.Similar to other Christopher Nolan movies, there is little you can complain about in terms of 'fun factor', production qualities or actors' performance. But the problems arise when we descend to a deeper level where 'big topics' are supposedly to be discussed. There we encounter a storyline and arguments resembling a background scenario of a superior first-person video game. In fact, when you ponder about it, there is little to Inception apart from visual experience, which is the norm for blockbusters with high ratings on IMDb.",4,2,2,9 November 2014
The Shawshank Redemption," an alright movie to watch
","It is not uncommon to hire people to write reviews on social networks that should appear to be by independent contributors. That's why i had to laugh when i saw The Shawshank Redemption being the best rated movie on IMDb. But since there would be little sense in making such an effort to generate more than a million votes and almost three thousand reviews for a movie made in 1994 i assume this is genuine.In any case, based on Stephen King's novella, The Shawshank Redemption was an alright prison movie to watch. However, it displays what i see as typical for King's work. When he's writing science fiction, fantasy or horror it all sits well. But when he writes anything that should mirror reality it simply feels fake in the same way as wearing a cotton shirt and the one made of synthetics feels different. The events might have been based on actual events, but i haven't been convinced.Obviously when you make any kind of list, there will always be a first place. On IMDb it is currently being taken by The Shawshank Redemption.",5,3,7,26 October 2013
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," learn to fly
","I think that people writing negative reviews got mislead by the trailer. I had some false hopes myself and expected a drama in CGI environment, yet eventually i've seen a great movie. Birdman is a psychological portrait of a strained actor whose mainstream career took a turn twenty years before the events portrayed in the movie. This parallel with real-life situation of Michael Keaton and his reluctance to stay on board the Batman franchise in 1990s was a nice touch.In the given environment Alejandro G. Iñárritu has some surprisingly positive moments and didn't only intend to drag us through the shards of main character's life. His state of mind dictated the tempo and came across in a convincing pseudo single shot, a long take that stretched across the whole movie. The soundtrack, consisting mostly of jazz improvisation, underlines the strain to which our hero has been exposed.If you like theater, then Birdman might be interesting for you. It actually is a theater piece brought to screen and mocks the industry and the media surrounding it. Because, the real power is not your motivation, qualities or achievements, but how many people clicked on the link in which you've appeared.",7,0,4,8 February 2015
Straight Outta Compton," how you like it
","Whether you'd like Straight Outta Compton depends on how you like hip hop. However, if you're a NWA fan you probably know all there is to know about the events depicted in the movie.With Dr. Dre and Ice Cube among producers i can assume that the facts are slightly skewed. But even this notion, and i admit it is slightly below the line, doesn't influence the big picture. This is one fine biopic.The rest is really your opinion. If you're into hip hop, this is one of those movies that would be a candidate for the Holy Grail. My opinion, though, is implied by my vote...The resemblance of the actors to the real-life NWA members is amazing, although i didn't expect less from O'Shea Jackson Jr. for obvious reasons.My strongest impression, though, is how biopics such as Straight Outta Compton influence my opinion about the protagonists. I like to call it 'Wikpedia's drawback'. In this particular case, i've listened to NWA and later mostly Dr. Dre and formed my opinion both about the authors and their output. This is some kind of idealized picture. But when you read on Wikipedia or see a biopic and realize how it all really happened it always gives me a whole new insight. And such insights are not always positive.Yet again, this is all just my opinion.",4,49,123,28 December 2015
The Dark Knight Rises," the grand finale
","Here is the movie we've been waiting for. On the trail of the The Dark Knight Returns comic book, Bruce Wayne is past his prime, yet the villains aren't slacking.The thing that amazed me the most is the realism of the world imagined in this movie. There is some reference to people's uprisings against the evil regime, which i'd dare to interpret as a reference to the Occupy movement in the US.Anne Hathaway and Tom Hardy offer great performance and are valuable members of the cast. We might discuss the realism or cheesiness of the ending, nevertheless The Dark Knight Rises is a great movie.",6,0,3,18 April 2014
Before Sunrise," very good in retrospect
","I started to truly appreciate Before Sunrise after the third installment of this 'series', Before Midnight, filmed two decades later. Without this dimension, knowing that there were two more movies with the same characters and in the same vein, Before Sunrise would have been just another art-house movie.We follow the protagonists that meet accidentally on the train. They seem to be the ideal Western combination, French female polyglot and American male with artistic tendencies. They spend a night together in Vienna and discover their own landmarks of the city.What sets apart this movie with from all other similar features is the dialog. The whole movie is more or less one lengthy conversation with all advantages and disadvantages such an approach might bring with itself. Yet, they touch all possible topics interesting to the people of their age, presumably early twenties. They range from abstract thought on life, arts and passage of time to reference of the civil war in the former Yugoslavia, raging couple of hundreds of kilometers away.",6,0,0,18 April 2014
Moonrise Kingdom," someone was nostalgic about his/her childhood
","While watching Moonrise Kingdom, i had the feeling that the person who wrote it (or envisioned it) was actually nostalgic about his/her childhood. Because, despite all insecurities and difficulties portrayed, there has been a layer sweet melancholy beneath. As if the author wanted to go back to those years and relive them and not necessarily change them.The cast is just fine and the plot will keep you going, but if i'd need to retell the story i probably wouldn't be able to. I would only say that it is a story about growing up in a time that was harmless in comparison to today's circumstances. Moonrise Kingdom is a nice pastime, but neither a masterpiece nor a must-see.",5,2,4,5 October 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," the weakest part in the trilogy
","Overall, The Lord of the Rings trilogy will be remembered as a milestone in the history of movie making. But when analyzing each move separately, i must admit that this was the weakest. My dissatisfaction doesn't stem from comparison to J.R.R. Tolkien's books, because i think that a movie should always be viewed as an independent piece of art. I was merely thinking about what i've seen.Apart from the fantasy world of the Middle Earth, everything that stayed in my memory were endless battle sequences and Frodo crying most of the time. The former was necessary because of the scale of the conflict portrayed, but the second is a mystery to me. I understand that Frodo is showing true heroism by taking an assignment that is obviously too much a for a small hobbit. But there were other means for showing him being overwhelmed with emotion.On the other hand, i guess that the trilogy would have never gotten the funding without grand action sequences. I may reproach Peter Jackson about his artistic integrity, but i was not there when he negotiated the funding with producers. Still, since the first two parts were already more than successful, i think he had some possibility to negotiate the finale and make it less like a blockbuster.",4,2,3,19 May 2013
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," predictable
","There is a spoiler warning, although it might not be necessary.Anyhow, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire follows the structure of its prequel. There was an introduction into social and political background of the society we've seen before. An endless action sequence of the Hunger Games follows although we've known from the beginning that the good guys would outsmart the villains. Eventually, we're left lingering until the last installment of the trilogy, which would actually be one movie separated into two parts.But this is still alright. What is not alright is the media frenzy about a message of the movie, as if there were one. Donald Sutherland even gave an interview wishing Hunger Games would stir up a revolution (Guardian, Tuesday 19 November 2013). I'm not sure with which audience this should have resonated, probably angry Twitter users and Facebook renegades. In this sense MTV Jackass had more impact on contemporary youth than effort of all NGOs combined.This movie isn't bad in itself, yet it is nothing more than a repetition of the first movie in the series.",3,7,14,18 April 2014
The Matrix," a movie that changed SF
","At the time of it's creation, The Matrix was a real breakthrough. Combining superior special effect with kung-fu action and a groundbreaking plot, it managed to become a milestone in movie making, not necessarily limited to it's genre.If you're into SF, you've recognized the influence of William Gibson's Neuromancer and, to a lesser extent, Blade Runner (1982). And both would have led to Philip K. Dick's questioning the reality. More than that, there was almost a philosophical background to the story.At any rate, The Matrix was released in the time when internet has still been explored, rather than an everyday tool. It showcased everything we've craved for while playing games on PC and game consoles. And today when we basically live online, it is hard not to remember what this movie forecasts for the near future.",10,1,2,30 April 2013
Godzilla," high-budget trash movie
","With IMDb rating for Godzilla slowly falling it's actually reaching the objective level, which is unfortunately not the case with all movies. Although i've been acquainted with Godzilla lore, the last movie about it i consciously remember seeing has been the Ronald Emmerich's effort. On the one hand the new Godzilla is closer to the 'original' than the aforementioned 1998 movie, involving some scary monsters and vaguely interesting story. On the other hand it is an oversimplification in terms of plot, acting and logic.To put things in perspective, let me add that i didn't expect anything from World War Z and it turned out to be a fine movie. With the same open-mindedness i approached Godzilla and went home with insulted intelligence afterwards.",2,8,17,2 November 2014
Cloud Atlas," excellent, but not a masterpiece
","Cloud Atlas is one of the movies that is almost on par with its literary template. Unfortunately, due to six loosely connected stories, there were cuts to be made in order to bring them to the screen. This is felt during the movie, even if you haven't read the book.Overall, Cloud Atlas is a great experience, both visually and as a story which is rather complicated to be retold. I was not able to sense the broader philosophical context which has been mentioned by the authors during the movie's promotion.What i appreciated is a happy ending, despite the fact that it is not in line with the original story.",7,0,1,30 April 2013
300," 3 stars for 300
","If i remember right, 300 brought to screen a comic book inspired by a Hollywood movie Frank Miller saw in his youth. Given this telephone game of sorts, we can only imagine the level of historical accuracy in 300.Therefore, 300 should be viewed simply as an action movie, which it is. There is little pausing between adrenaline-pumping sequences and if this is what you're looking for, then you've chosen your movie right.Otherwise, 300 offers one-dimensional characters and a lot of half-witted lines that incited heroic deeds in countless Hollywood action movies. The good guys are righteous beautiful demigods. The bad guys are despicable creatures, strong in numbers, but no match for the skillful Spartans.Visually, 300 is great, especially if you're into comics, which is its strongest quality...",3,5,8,30 April 2013
Jackie Brown," probably Tarantino's finest effort
","Jackie Brown is probably the only movie by Quentin Tarantino i'd watch more than once. The reason is that in this one we see characters, not caricatures. We even see an occasional moment of genuine emotion by some of them.Of course, with Tarantino it is always a question whether there is a higher meaning behind his output. Jackie Brown is a crime thriller, but i haven't been able to find any context apart the obvious.The cast is well chosen, the setting the regular shady world of crooks and gangsters. As with all his movies, a superb soundtrack accompanied it. And on the wave of success of Pulp Fiction i think this is where Tarantino decided to make a movie in every possible genre he loved. Everything filmed after Jackie Brown confirms my assumption.",8,4,6,4 March 2014
Gangs of New York," too long and pretentious
","This has been the last time i fell for director's story about longing to make a movie. During one of the interviews supporting the release, Mr. Scorsese told a heartwarming tale about a childhood dream come true, the dream being Gangs of New York. Yet, after watching the movie i felt betrayed.The plot actually resembles a pulp fiction version of a Charles Dickens novel. The result is a gallery of characters that might be corresponding well with the reality of New York back in the day, but together resemble a freak show on the loose.Except Daniel Day Lewis the crew offers nothing memorable. This is valid also for Mr. Scorsese who squeezed himself and a couple of family members into a cameo appearance.",2,2,7,5 November 2013
Mad Max: Fury Road," road warrior after years on amphetamines and steroids
","The best thing about Fury Road is that Mel Gibson chose not to repeat his role as Mad Max. And if you have some spare time and decide to waste a couple of hours on this so-called movie, you'd understand why his decision was right.The story of Fury Road fits one simple sentence: Sort-of introduction, action sequence, the end. However, if you measure the movie's success by it's box office performance, this is clearly a masterpiece.If you believe that everything happens for a reason, then how this crappy scenario got this kind of budget? My best guess is that it addresses the audience that grew up on action movies in the past ten years or so. That implies almost non-existent script, zero character development and focus on action or, as some film critic aptly put it, 'eruptions of craziness'.",1,35,71,27 June 2015
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," special effects and some 'good fun'
","I spent an evening in a room with a TV set, for reasons that don't matter in this review. It turned out that a producer on one of the channels wanted to treat the audience with a Michael Bay double feature. The reason for that was the cinema premiere of Transformers: Age of Extinction.Quickly i started treating the TV set as moving picture on the wall and did some other things while occasionally casting a glance in it's direction. But i didn't really miss much. It quickly became clear that this movie has great special effects bordering with a video game brought to cinema. Therefore the second star in my rating.Shia LaBeouf has one and the same facial expression throughout most the movie which also summarizes his acting in Transformers: Dark of the Moon. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley might look interesting in some men's magazine, with or without her clothes, but as soon as she opens her mouth, her inability to act becomes obvious, even at the low level implied by this movie.Even this is too much text for such a moneymaking masterpiece.",2,1,4,4 October 2014
In the Land of Blood and Honey," black-and-white picture of the world
","In the Land of Blood and Honey passed almost unnoticed among viewers and critics alike, except in the countries that emerged from the former Yugoslavia, where it created a considerable controversy.In order to understand this, we'd have to explain the history of Balkans and origins of civil war that led to the collapse of Yugoslavia. But even the executive summary of such a story would take up more time than Angelina Jolie's feature film directorial debut.So if you ignore historical background and accuracy, this is essentially a bad movie. The script is idiotic and acting mediocre. In order to make the movie more realistic the characters talk in English with local dialect. This might be convincing to the average viewer but sounds stupid to anyone who knows this part of the world.The only good thing is the atmosphere at the beginning of the conflict, where most of the people believed the war would be over in a matter of weeks.I find it remarkable that a star like Angelina Jolie devotes her times to humanitarian work and tells the world the untold stories of human suffering. At the same time it is regrettable that such stories are biased according to the current dogma envisioned by international politics and media. According to that, it is crystal clear who the good guys are and they should be absolved from all wrongdoing. On the other hand, for the supposed misdeeds of the bad guys the whole population of their country should be punished until eternity.This is black-and-white image of the world which, in my opinion, is against the founding principles of UNHCR, where Angelina Jolie holds a distinguished post.",2,19,27,30 March 2014
The Martian," good fun
","Since i've seen Interstellar (2014) it is understandable that i would be skeptical about another SF movie happening in outer space and on another planet. However, The Martian was made with such amount of self-depreciating humor that the scientific and 'scientific' facts didn't disturb me at any time.And this is exactly how i suggest to watch The Martian. It is an unassuming SF pastime without the ambition to share with us some higher truth. Not reading the book is no hindrance, besides i prefer the movie to talk for itself independently from the book.My experience suggest that The Martian doesn't necessarily need to be seen in 3D. Despite some shots, scenes and scenery that are impressive, 2D would to the trick just as fine.",6,5,12,1 November 2015
