Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," I finally saw it...and still can't figure it out.
","Ok. So the movie is astounding as a visual experience. We all know that. We also know that the acting is not the most important feature on this flick. As a member of the audience I felt like trying to erase what I have seen in the star wars trilogy but some how the images and charm of those movies simply could not match here. Something is missing. Obviously its a new beginning but is more than that what bothers me. Its that the characters are not spherical in any scense. Darth Maul for starters. he is amazing, but I could not believe that he went as fast as he came. Ewan's Character is very close to the Idea that i had about Obi Wan in his youth, maybe it will all be compensated in the next two films for him. Anakin's lines are so superficial that makes a terrible mistake: the connection with our galaxy, a thing that did not happen in the other movies. I think that George Lucas was so concentrated in his digital domain of visual shock that he did not pay attention to the acting. Somehow the movie's best moments are those involving less acting and more action, like the pod race and the gungan war againts the battle droids. Now, thats very impresive enough. Yes, but why as a fan I feel...not as happy?. From the fan point of view I can forgive star wars' Darth Vader so insecure and lacking of the real darkness he represents in Empire Strikes Back and Jedi, and so I will forgive the 'duh' personality young anakin has, and that Jar Jar Binks does not make me laugh, on the contrary he will not be as memorable as Chewbacca or the ewoks them selves. I figured out that this movie was not made for my age, nor for my expectations. But I enjoyed watching it, remembering when I was 9 years old and saw Star Wars for the first time.
