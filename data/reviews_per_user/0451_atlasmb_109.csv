Blade Runner 2049," A Great Sequel
","A good film will take you someplace you have never been. 'Blade Runner 2049' is set in a dystopian future that is very convincing due to its superior production values. At the same time, the film hearkens back to 'Blade Runner' in numerous ways, providing a foundation for the millions of loyal fans who long for a continuation of the original story. Echoes of the past are achieved, variously, through music, scenery, common actors, and an atmosphere and tone that evoke Ridley Scott's seminal prequel.The storyline of the new film is quite good, maintaining a consistency between the films, yet advancing the action into a future that has evolved beyond. K (Ryan Gosling), like his predecessor--Rick Deckard--is a blade runner tasked with eliminating replicants (androids) that are deemed dangerous to society. Basically, this is a police procedural dressed in stylish garb.The film provides plenty to chew on relative to the power structure of society and, more importantly, the nature of man versus artificial man.The wonderful cast is blessed with some meaty roles. Robin Wright plays Lieutenant Joshi, K's superior officer. Ana de Armas is Joi, K's unusual girlfriend. Jared Leto is Niander Wallace--a man so rich he effectively makes his own laws. And Sylvia Hoeks is Luv, Wallace's attendant and enforcer. Hoeks channels a ruthless energy, a detached efficiency, and a physicality that could remind one of the 'Terminator' franchise.'Blade Runner 2049' is an impressive accomplishment by director Denis Villeneuve and his team. The film deserves multiple viewings to extract all of its nuance and meanings. This is rare sequel that lives up to the reputation of the original.",10,3,11,18 October 2017
Skyfall," Craig is Bond for the 21st Century
","I enjoyed this latest installment in the Bond series. I saw all of the Bond films during their first releases. In the 50th anniversary year of the franchise, Skyfall makes playful references to Bond films past and also establishes some roles for future episodes. This mission is of a more personal nature and takes place in today's world, where politics are related to terrorism and terrorism's greatest weapon is most likely a computer.The story knowingly uses the blond villain convention, something that might seem cartoon-like. But Daniel Craig's Bond is anything but the infallible superhero. He is world weary and cynical. Perhaps he is more the hero because he must overcome his limitations. The entire cast is great.",7,2,9,25 November 2012
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Timeless Storytelling
","At the time of this writing, 'E.T.' is thirty-three years old and, despite major advances in special effects and film technology, it is still a watchable classic.Spielberg does a good job bringing the viewer on a journey as seen through children's eyes. And, as in 'Jaws', he engages our imagination by not revealing the unknown stranger immediately.The film can be seen as an alternative to the many other foreboding films of alien visitation. E.T. is not a conquering villain or an inscrutable destructive force. He is a childlike being with an appreciation of beauty.'E.T.' shows what can be done with some puppetry, special effects, good acting, wonderful music and, of course, timeless storytelling. Like 'The Wizard of Oz', 'E.T.' has charm and an emotionally-charged story that remains forever in style.",9,1,3,16 June 2015
Casablanca," A Great Drama and Love Story
","The story opens on December 2, 1941. The progress of Axis forces has stalled outside Stalingrad. Rommel's Afrika Korps were just defeated in Egypt. On the other side of Africa, Casablanca, Morroco is the crossroads of politics--''unoccupied France'--where everyone has an angle or a desperate dream. Local police share their powers with Vichy and Nazi forces. And at the center of Casablanca is a bar where everyone goes. It is owned by Richard Blaine (Humphrey Bogart)--an American who is above the fray, indifferent to politics. Business is his religion and his mistress.The death of two German couriers triggers a shakedown of the 'usual suspects' and a general alert goes out for the murderer and for a dissident who has escaped from Europe. On this night a foreign couple arrives, upsetting the delicate equilibrium of Casablanca and Rick's world. Rick insists 'I stick my neck out for nobody', but the police captain Renault (Claude Rains) suspects that Rick is 'At heart a sentimentalist'. The story of 'Casablanca' is multi-layered. While it is a product of its time and place, it is also universal and timeless. Every time I watch this film, I discover more details and I appreciate more how well constructed it is.Filmed during WWII, 'Casablanca' is an acknowledged classic and winner of the Oscar for Best Film. There are many reasons for its reputation, including a stellar cast, excellent writing, its music, and a stylish presentation that might be called international noir. It is a tremendous love story within a political drama. No doubt it will remain a favorite of film fans...as time goes by.",10,1,2,17 May 2015
Minority Report," A Sci-fi Classic
","In a future where homicides can be prevented by a Pre-crime Unit, the practice is controversial. How can you incarcerate someone for a crime not committed? It is the eve of a national referendum on Pre-crime and Chief John Anderton's (Tom Cruise) world is about to be turned upside down. The Justice Department sends Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) to oversee his operation. But that is only the beginning of his problems.This is a wonderful film that combines a fantastic story by Philip K. Dick with a thoughtful and convincing future world, full of day-to-day technology that feels both exhilarating and fearsome.'Minority Report' has a complex script with many twists. It is complemented by the skillful and stunning direction of Steven Spielberg. While watching, so many moments capture the eye and the imagination.I consider this a sci-fi classic, a fully-realized crime drama fused to an exploration of social issues.",10,1,2,27 September 2015
Finding Neverland," The Second Star to the Right
","The secret to the success of 'Peter Pan' lies in its ability to tap into the imaginations of its audience. That the film 'Finding Neverland' manages to do the same thing is a remarkable achievement.J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) is a soft-spoken, imaginative man with a childlike tendency to indulge in whimsy. He endures his strained marriage--and the other realities of life--by immersing himself in playwrighting. When he meets a widow (Kate Winslet) and her four boys, he involves himself in their lives, ignoring social mores.Inspired by his foster family, Barrie begins to write the play 'Peter Pan'. The film manages to cross back and forth over the line between reality and fantasy, mirroring Barrie's view of life. It is a wonderful accomplishment, achieved in no small part by the film's beautiful score. The actors uniformly turn in solid performances. Overall, the production values are excellent and London of 1903 comes to life on screen. This film has a gentle soul and will appeal to anyone who understands the heart of Pan, the boy.",9,1,1,24 March 2015
Lifeboat," Another Hitchcock Master Work
","Released during WWII, Alfred Hitchcock's 'Lifeboat' is a wonderful study of human nature. Seven survivors of a ship torpedoed by a German U-boat are joined by a German survivor. Without many resources, their ultimate goal is survival.This wonderful cast of eight portrays characters from every part of society--from the upper crust woman (Tallulah Bankhead as Connie Porter) adorned with fur and diamonds to a ship's laborer (Canada Lee as Joe Spencer), from a nurse to an industrialist. But the differences between appearance and reality are illuminated as the story presents hardship after hardship.Issues of class, race and politics are highlighted as Hitchcock strips away the veneer of society's rules and peels back the layers that make up the personality of each character. The film asks if you can truly know anyone. It suggests that people behave differently in times of emergency and extreme stress. But are we merely seeing the true nature of people in such moments?Given world circumstances, the German character (Walter Slezak as Willi) becomes the symbol for an entire nation and its political philosophy. Or is he merely a man who also suffers at the hands of his misguided military leaders?The boat becomes its own 'country', where concepts of governance are tested. This is an important part of the story, for it shows that one's political preferences reveal one's true beliefs about the nature of man.With such a brilliant script (from a story by William Steinbeck), an excellent cast, and Hitchcock's shining stewardship, it is no wonder that 'Lifeboat' is a film that will never lose its luster or its relevance.",9,1,1,10 April 2016
A Star Is Born," Unbelievably Believable
","Those who have seen the first three iterations of this film story will recognize the narrative arc of this version, which most resembles the 1976 forerunner. The major difference is the two lead actors.Part Barbra. Part Bette. Part Liza. Gaga (Ally) delivers a performance that is reminiscent of and worthy of these other mononymous stars, delivering a fresh portrayal that dispenses with the glitz and pretension of her stage persona. Even more importantly, we believe she is falling in love with the man who stumbles into her life---providing a chemistry that was lacking in some other versions.Sleeping on her bed under the album cover for Carole King's 'Tapestry', she is believable as a young woman in a suburban family bedroom. When she interacts with Bradley Cooper (Jackson Maines) or walks onto a stadium stage for the first time, we believe.Bradley Cooper, who also directed, is Jackson. Part Kris Kristofferson. Part Jim Morrison. Part Jeff Bridges. With an unexpected voice that growls like a weary instrument---tainted by alcohol, drugs, and inner demons----he embodies the scarred soul too weak to firmly grasp the lifeline that Ally extends. And Sam Elliott (Bobby) really feels like Jack's brother.Ally is a person you care about. In fact, the film felt too short for me. A rarity, but I wish the story of this relationship had been developed even more.I like all the earlier versions of this story, so this one had plenty to live up to. And it delivered.",9,0,3,21 February 2019
Gravity," Best Film Since Avatar!
","It would be wrong to mention anything about the plot beyond what is revealed in the trailers. I will just say that they should start lining up the Oscars. I see nominations for best film, best actress, maybe best supporting actor, best special effects, best cinematography, best sound, best score, best editing, and a special Oscar for the system devised to create the amazing images. I probably left some out.Quite simply, this is the best film since Avatar. Like Avatar, it combines excellent acting with a great story and amazing special effects.The result is an experience that is moving on a visceral level and also inspiring.I saw Gravity on IMAX in 3D, but I think it would be great with any system. This is what cinema is all about!",10,3,11,23 October 2013
To Be or Not to Be," A Wonderful Film Featuring Benny And Lombard
","This cinematic satire, directed by Ernst Lubitsch, contains some excellent acting--especially by its leads, Jack Benny and Carole Lombard. Its story is clever and funny. Lubitsch certainly earns, again, our respect for his directorial skills.But regardless of the talents on display in 'To Be or Not To Be', this is a film that should be seen for its place in history.Just two years before its release, Chaplin gave the world the wonderful film 'The Great Dictator', a tour de force spoof of Hitler. And it was very successful. It found an appreciative audience in the early days of the world conflict.'To Be or Not To Be' did not receive the same warm welcome, mostly due its place in the chronology of its time:First: The film is shotThen: Pearl Harbor is attacked, bringing the United States into the war.Then: Carole Lombard dies in a plane crash while supporting the American war effort.Then: The film, edited and completed, is released.Obviously the pall of Carole Lombard's death hung over the film. How difficult would it be to laugh at a film under those circumstances? Then consider the tremendous stresses of a country just entering a global conflict on multiple fronts--relatives going off to war, families trying to find a new balance, the challenges of a nationwide effort to reindustrialize, the profound shift in economics on a national scale, the fear of military enemies whose motives and methods seemed somewhat unfathomable.Looking back now, it is easier to enjoy this film, even though we have a much greater understanding of the horrible realities of Hitler's plans. Though our viewpoint is clouded with wistfulness, this film deserves to be celebrated, especially for the performances of Benny and Lombard, which are seminal in the careers of both artists.",9,4,9,2 April 2017
Wayne's World," If This Film Was Breakfast, It Would Be Ham And Excellent!
","Wayne Campbell (Mike Myers) broadcasts a cable access show called Wayne's World from his parents' basement, along with his best friend Garth Algar (Dana Carvey). Although they have little going for them except the show, we won't call them losers. They are slackers, because they are generally happy with their lives. Mike is like the typical class clown. Garth is socially awkward.The film is a slice of life comedy, a (SNL) skit-to-flick adaptation directed by Penelope Spheeris. I don't want to mention the scenes or comedy bits--some now iconic--throughout the film. But Myers and Carvey are comedic geniuses and they get to display their talents in various ways.Tia Carrere plays Cassandra, the object of Wayne's desires. As lead singer for a rock group, she shows off her great voice. Who knew?Other actors included to good effect are Rob Lowe and Lara Flynn Boyle. I also enjoyed the appearances of Colleen Camp, Brian Doyle-Murray, Donna Dixon, Chris Farley, Meat Loaf, Robert Patrick, and Ed O'Neill.This might be considered low brow humor, but many of the jokes are rather erudite. On all levels, this is one funny film.",8,0,0,15 October 2017
Unbreakable," Lethargic Pace Drags Down This Film
","'Unbreakable' stars Bruce Willis as David Dunn, a listless, pessimistic security guard whose marriage is on the skids. He is riding a train when it goes off the tracks and all passengers are killed except him. Soon after, he finds an anonymous note on his windshield asking him how often he is sick. This leads him to Elijah Price, a comic book art dealer who proposes an incredible hypothesis that changes David's life.The film has a lethargic pace and a subdued, quiet tone. Just like the main character. I kept waiting for the film to break out of its somnambulistic pace, but that never happens. There are revelations and dramatic moments, but 'Unbreakable' never breaks out of its contemplative tone.It also never ties up numerous loose ends that were obviously written with the intention of linking characters and plot points. Notes in IMDb report that director M. Knight Shyamalan wrote a much longer script that might have been presented as a trilogy. The ending might as well have included the message 'To be continued...' The story has supernatural elements, as might be expected for Shyamalan and, in parts, feels like a graphic novel adapted to film. If sequels are not coming, perhaps someone might consider a television series. Otherwise, the film's ending is a disappointment. It would be difficult to match the quality of the acting in the film, however.",6,2,3,22 July 2015
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A Deathstar is Born
","This 'Star Wars' episode contains many references to 'past' episodes, including the CGI rendition of actors no longer available. Most of the designs will be familiar to aficionados; especially the battleships and fighters. And there is a nod to the original cantina scene, with an assortment of exotic aliens.The story itself feels rushed in the beginning of the film. The main character, Jyn Erso (Felicity Jones), is introduced and the drama is set on its path, but Felicity is an interesting character and she deserves more exposition. The basic story is predictable, filled with time-sensitive saves and the usual battle action.A droid character, K-2SO (Alan Tudyk in motion-capture gear), steals scenes with humor. He is my favorite part of the film. Donnie Chen plays Chirrut Imwe in a Blind Monk homage that is also a highlight.The film delivers plenty of action, which will satisfy many fans, but most of that action feels like scenes from previous episodes and fails to stir the emotions.",7,3,5,8 April 2017
World War Z," WWZ worth a look
","Having read the negative comments during production of WWZ, and knowing they reshot the film's ending, I went into it hoping that the film might live up to the hype.This film is all about Brad Pitt. He is the one constant throughout the film. Other characters were not as developed.The action starts early in the story. The viewer is thrust into the thick of things in a way that might be too abrupt, but the premise of the movie is that the global issue developed so quickly that the authorities could not contain it.The action is consistent. Once we understand what the problem is, the story quickly--through the efforts of Pitt's character--takes us to the heart of the action. We are transported from one location, and its tasks, to another. A claustrophobic feeling is achieved through darkness, confined spaces, offscreen sounds, and even rain. The mood is consistently engaging.The suitability of the ending might be argued, but I was okay with it. It did have an abrupt feeling, like other films that set themselves up for sequels.",7,1,4,23 July 2013
Passengers," A Beautiful Sci-fi Romance
","I loved this film! The visuals are wonderful. The sets are impressive and the designs are stylish.The music is perfect, adding the right touches at the right moments.The story is original, clever, and it moves along well, keeping every scene interesting. I can understand why the actors, upon reading the script, wanted to be in this film.The relationship between the two main characters is touching. It is also more complicated than the typical formulaic love stories.The story also contains some moral questions. How nice to experience an intelligent film with some ambiguity that challenges the viewer, combined with a romance that has emotional depth.One of the best films of the year.",10,3,9,6 January 2017
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," A Tasteful, Lovable Romcom
","There are few romantic comedies released in the past twenty years that I would watch multiples times, but this is one.It starts with a couple headed for divorce, but there is no bitterness or name calling. This is a good-natured film filled with likable characters trying to cope with the difference between love's dreams and love's disillusionments.The cast is perfect for a comedy: Steve Carell, Marisa Tomei, Emma Stone, and Ryan Gosling, for starters. There is not a lot of mugging for the camera, like you might find in other comedies. And there is a marked absence of humor about bodily functions (which has brought many recent comedies down to the seventh grade level).The film is punctuated by laughs, touching scenes, and even a few moments that elicit a pleasant mistiness. This can be credited to both the script and the actors. Directors Glenn Ficarra and John Requa deserve credit as well.Carell plays the disappointed husband who is forced to re-examine his life after many years of marriage. Gosling is a ladies' man who exudes confidence and savoir faire. Stone plays a young woman whose future revolves around her predictable and bland fiancÃ©. In a smaller role, Tomei is a school teacher who frequents bars, desperate for any semblance of authenticity from the men she meets there.I really enjoyed this film. And the final act feels like a traditional farce, complete with revelations and well-timed interactions.",9,0,1,26 April 2020
Ted," Seth McFarlane at his creative best
","I am a big fan of Seth McFarlane. Therefore, I had some idea what kind of humor might be in this movie. It was accommodating, with puerile humor mixed with very sophisticated humor. And irreverence was the overriding tone. As expected. Anyone who goes to this film expecting anything else is not realistic or knowledgeable. That would be like going to a film by Michael Moore and then complaining that it is left leaning.The best way to describe this film is to call it the opposite of a chick flick. But there were scenes of genuine emotion and tenderness.The lead character, Ted, is so well realized that one almost forgets to even watch for the technical accomplishments. The film is worth seeing on that basis alone.",7,0,1,11 January 2013
Don Jon," Interesting, but uninspired.
","Don is a young man who lives like the prototypical New Jersey guido. His life revolves around porn, trying to score with women, working out, and having dinner with the family, roughly in that order. His lifestyle is designed to please himself, with the possible exception of spending time with the family and going to church, which is also a familial obligation.He measures success in life by easily quantifiable measures: how much weight can you lift? how many (quantifiably desirable) women can you bed? how many acts of contrition does the priest proscribe?Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Jon is a simple man. He meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson), a simple but stunning woman, and decides he has fallen in love. In the course of that relationship, he meets Esther (Julianne Moore), an older, more complex woman, who introduces him to some foreign ideas about relationships and sex. Don learns a few things in the process.The acting in this film is excellent. The story is interesting, but uninspired. Because the story is about some 'shallow' people, there is little passion in 'Don Jon'. The sexual content will undoubtedly annoy some viewers.",7,0,1,26 January 2015
Deadpool 2," DP2 Brings It Again
","It has been said that 'Deadpool 2' is even better than the original film, and I agree. '2' has the best elements of the first film, but taken to a greater degree. You still get the running, machine-gun comedy riffs, like Jim Carrey on speed. You still get the fourth-wall breaking asides. And the same irreverence, the same self-referential comments, the same darkness, the same gore, the plethora of cinematic references. And more of it.Some reviewers didn't find enough comedy in the film. Almost every line was a punch line, so were they not catching certain references? Possibly. Some complained that the film's POV was too far to the left. Yes, there were anti-rightwing insults, but there were also numerous lampoons of P.C. platitudes. The best things about the Deadpool films are the level of originality and creativity, the willingness to take risks. Fortunately, the second installment does not back away from that formula.",9,1,2,5 October 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," Wowzapalooza
","Wow. Filled with inspired choices, 'Thor: Ragnorak' is a real treat to watch. Credit director Taika Waititi with many of them. And hope he returns for the planned sequel. Following are some reasons why this film, which I did not watch in 3-D, is impressive and thrilling.The visuals. By now, one could be complacent about quality CGI, but for pure spectacle, T:R ranks among the best so far. The depiction of alien worlds, battle scenes, and many characters are among the wonderful special effects featured in this film.Casting. First there is the inspired casting of Cate Blanchett as Hela, the primary villain. She is determined to conquer Asgard. (But she might have to stand in line, considering the contingent of antagonists who wish to destroy Thor or his beloved home.) Tom Hiddleston is always perfect as Loki. Tessa Thompson is Valkyrie, a confident warrior with uncertain loyalties. Jeff Goldblum is a cocksure Grandmaster with a personality that totally fits the quirky comedic sensibility that director Waititi has given T:R. And there are plenty of other castings and cameos that are delightful.Humor. Already mentioned, the humor is a major component of the film (similar to 'Guardians of the Galaxy') and should not be taken for granted. There is a real risk in injecting silliness into a film of Gods and legendary warriors battling to the death.The story. T:R has a twisting storyline that feels really inspired. The non-linear narrative is filled with surprises and happy moments of discovery. And there is a precise balance between the light-hearted banter and whimsical sidetracks versus the serious conflicts between The God of Thunder and those who would destroy him, his people, and his world. As a final example of perfect choices made, a certain Led Zeppelin song feels like it was made for insertion into one of the final scenes, like there is a momentary pause while Odin, perhaps, cues up the tune.",10,5,11,15 November 2017
Zodiac," A Dramatization of the Zodiac Killer Case
","'Zodiac' is a fact-based film starring Jake Gyllenhaal as Robert Graysmith, a cartoonist for a San Francisco newspaper during the Zodiac killings of the seventies. The story is about Graysmith's obsession over many years with the unsolved case.Also central to the story are Robert Downey, Jr. as Paul Avery, a colleague who handles the crime beat while fighting his own destructive personality, and Mark Ruffalo as David Toschi, an inspector for the SFPD who tries to solve the case.This is a lengthy film, but it serves to match the protracted time that Graysmith dedicates to his investigation. The film is an interesting, chronological telling of the story, including the somewhat chimerical crime spree and the city-wide panic it inspired. The acting is good, and the main reason this film is enjoyable.",7,1,1,27 April 2015
Moana," A Beautiful World Of Magic
","'Moana' is another animated classic by Disney Studios. The images are beautiful, including some depictions of nighttime and low light conditions that are amazing. The visuals are paired with some wonderfully stirring tribal music.The story is about a quest. Moana is the heroine who pursues her dreams and her mission and, of course, finds personal fulfillment and growth as well. Played by Auli'i Cravalho, it is difficult to imagine anyone better suited to the role. Dwyane Johnson plays Maui, her reluctant helper, a demigod.From the start, the film is revealed as a mythological story. It is based on traditional Polynesian stories of creation and general principles of nature worship. The artists at Disney created a magical world of beauty and imagination that is only rivalled by 'Avatar'.",9,0,3,16 June 2017
MASH," An Anti-war Message Wrapped In A Comedy
","Within the context of the Vietnam War, the release of 'MASH' was a significant act. The country was in the midst of another serious conflict--that between the doves (and peaceniks) of the political left and the hawks of the political right. Some were saying at the time that to support peace was to support the enemy, which was communism. It's preposterous of course, but that was the prevalent dialogue of the time. 'MASH', therefore, was a blast across the bow of the right.The film also lampoons religion, authority, and institutions, in general. Contributing to this impression is the unconventional style of dialogue, which--as in real life--is layered, with conversations on top of other conversations. The result is a general feeling of anarchy or confusion, which mirrors the chaotic nature of war.It is said that the majority of the dialogue was unscripted. The film certainly does feel that way during viewing. And it gives the film a slice-of-life feeling--an attribute that director Robert Altman became identified with and championed for (as with the film 'Nashville' a few years later).Despite its freeform construction, the film does have much to say about the inanity of most rules and institutional processes. However, it is only a shell of the Emmy-winning television show 'MASH' that followed, where the characters were fleshed out and the anti-war statement was made clearer.",7,1,2,30 May 2016
Closer," In The Name Of Truth
","'Closer' is a film that inescapably feels like a work by David Mamet. It is very wordy. The characters speak their feelings and their words feel important, rife with both surface and underground content. As such, the film is not for everyone. Its stylized conversations can feel artificial, though they are revealing and they honor truth above all else. Patrick Marber crafted the play and this adaptation.As the film follows its characters in and out of relationships, it puts truth on a pedestal, sacrifices its participants on the altar of truth, extracts from them glimpses into the true nature of man and woman.The cast features Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Clive Owen. Who could ask for more? They play four people of principle, who can change course on an emotional dime. Still, games are played between them, trying to save themselves or others from cruel truths. And the truths are always there to be seen if one is watching closely. Director Mike Nichols gives us an unvarnished look into the eyes of his cast.All four protagonists are sadists and masochists, punishing themselves for their perceived sins, punishing each other as well, perhaps as another means of punishing themselves. Natalie Portman's Alice is a real heartbreaker, calling on the slave (to beauty) and the savior in all of us.I am rating this film a '8', but I know I will eventually see it multiple times and I expect that grade to increase as its meanings reveal themselves to me. In the service of honesty, I must declare it.",8,1,3,1 October 2017
Interstellar," Worth Seeing, but not Spectacular
","Great music. An extremely talented cast. Amazing special effects. Captivating issues to contemplate. So why do I think I will not ponder this film long after I have viewed it? The story is convoluted, though interesting. All the drama and mystery and intrigue leads to a finale that tells us what? Well, not really much. But it's a fun trip getting there.I liked many of the characters. And I was invested in their problems and tragedies. But the final 'explanation' of the film's phenomena has a 'Sixth Sense' feeling to it. I say see this film for its good points, but don't expect the groundbreaking impact of Kubrick's '2001' or the atmospherics of 'Blade Runner' or the thrilling ride of 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'.",7,5,9,17 December 2014
American Sniper," A Well-Acted Story of Loss
","There seems to be a dearth of reviews that stick to the merits of this film. I will try to do better, though the intent of the director is a valid discussion point.First of all, I think the acting is excellent. Bradley Cooper is believable as a gung-ho marine and Sienna Miller really conveys the heartache of a spouse who feels she has no control over her life and her future.The scenes in the battle zones feel authentic, with a real sense of danger and uncertainty. The house to house fighting feels claustrophobic, adding to the suspense.'American Sniper' is based upon a true story. Sometimes it is difficult to discover what liberties are taken, but those I have read about are significant, if few. I really wish that filmmakers who take liberties with history would add a post script in the credits that details the facts that are changed. This would be a service to everyone and demonstrate the filmmaker's dedication to transparency and the truth.Hero. It's a word that is used too easily and too often. Those who, upon watching the film, declare Chris Kyle to be a hero, are, I think, imposing their own agenda upon the film's narrative. In scenes, we see that Chris is programmed by his father from an early age to view the world in simplistic terms. Once he accepts the world view of his father, he is little more than a bullet waiting to be fired. Yes, he has free will, but in a world where the United States is almost always involved in military conflict, he is destined to join the armed forces. In his case, 9/11 is the trigger.In the film, Kyle is a victim, not a hero. Once he fulfills his destiny and signs up, he is compelled to continue on this track. He cannot even admit to himself that he suffers from mental illness, let alone to his wife or an analyst. He becomes incapable of truly showing his love, even to his wife or children. Note that he never smiles when on leave, but he frequently laughs while on duty, even on missions. The movie also points out the pervasiveness of the gun culture--for those who seek it. Kyle is raised to value guns and to cherish the stopping of 'a beating heart'. It is natural that his military experience would center on his talent with a gun. Unfortunately, in his job as a sniper, he must make moral judgments from a distance--something that is virtually impossible to do without error. This fact comes to be the source of his mental decline, though he never admits the source of his breakdown. Because he never identifies the issue, he easily continues his attachment to guns afterwards, something that eventually destroys him.To those who will watch this film with an open mind, it does have lessons to learn, though it appears the director tried to subvert those lessons in the final scenes. Regardless of the director's intentions, the film speaks for itself and it tells a story of loss, not the story of redemption that some choose to see.",8,28,59,6 February 2015
Nightcrawler," Gyllenhaal is Strong in this Dark Drama.
","Jake Gyllenhaal, as Lou Bloom, creates a memorable character in 'Nightcrawler', reminiscent of the intensity of Deniro's role in 'Taxi Driver'. He is a young man who is anxious to establish a pathway through life. He struggles to find employment beyond the illegal odd jobs he creates for himself. When he asks the owner of a junkyard for a job, we find out why he can't find employment--he cannot see himself from the viewpoint of others. If he could, he would probably want to hide some of his traits. As the story plays out, we find that Lou has deeper problems, but he manages to create a job that he 'likes' and he achieves some success.But 'Nightcrawler' is really about the television news industry. With a nod to 'Network', it forces the viewer to consider the possible consequences of sensationalism in news. The film's narrative also invokes comparisons with 'Blow-Up' and 'The Conversation', as Lou's desire to succeed takes him deeper into the news stories to the point of personal involvement.Renee Russo (wife of director Dan Gilroy) plays Nina, the news director of a local television station. Because of her insecurity about her job, she follows Lou down his frightful path to 'success'.This is a dark film that asks serious questions of viewers, including what role they might play in influencing media news coverage.",7,2,3,23 April 2015
Oblivion," I enjoyed it
","I recommend Oblivion. The special effects alone make it worth seeing. Unless you choose to watch this film with a chip on your shoulder. Or if you think every homage is merely a rip-off of another film.There are many references to other sci-fi classics, which I found enjoyable. But I did not dwell on them during my viewing, because I was engaged in the story and the visuals.I also liked the cast, though, in some ways, they were playing second fiddle to the visuals. The sound and music were also enjoyable (the Led Zep sequence was magical).This film is best seen on a big screen with theater sound.",8,17,24,3 May 2013
Bohemian Rhapsody," An Interesting Portrayal Of Queen And Its Flamboyant Frontman
","This film about the rock group Queen primarily focuses on its frontman, Freddie Mercury. Based on actual events, it starts with the formation of the band and ends with Mercury's death, though Queen exists today with other members.The film shows Mercury to be charismatic, capricious, dramatic, inventive, confident and, appropriately, mercurial. Often he would subject others to his emotionally neediness. But he was always passionate about the band and their work. He is such a compelling figure, one might wonder why the writers chose to change any actual facts, often with no discernible dramatic benefit. Because of this factual digression, I am downgrading my score by one. This is quite disappointing.Still, the film is worth seeing. As a fan of the group's music, I enjoyed the inclusion of many of their best songs, especially the set from the Live Aid Concert at Wembley Stadium. Even non-fans have plenty to enjoy with the film's mix of music, drama, and comedy.Rami Malek's performance as Freddie Mercury has been singled out by most critics. Dental appliances and weeks of training to mimic Mercury's stage antics contribute to this compelling transformation. Mercury's flamboyance makes him very watchable and a suitable subject for a biopic.",7,1,1,25 February 2019
Baby Driver," Nobody Catches Baby In A Corner
","This film, which feels like it relies on the Tarantino playbook, is a fun romp with plenty of style.Baby (Ansel Elgort) is a baby-faced driver who can make any car turn on a dime or cut any corner. But there is much more to his story. As 'Baby Driver' unfolds, we discover the source of his basic unhappiness and the dreams and memories that plague and inspire him.This heist film, written and directed by Edgar Williams, has many enjoyable scenes. In all of them, Williams has fun with the camera, fun with the stunts and fun with the dialogue. It might bother some viewers that every scene feels choreographed to such a degree, including the shootouts, but Hitchcock and Tarantino also worked with such painstaking attention to detail. Choreography requires music, and 'Baby Driver' has an extensive soundtrack that magnifies the fun. Crank the volume up for maximum effect.Co-stars Kevin Spacey, Jamie Foxx, Lily James, Jon Hamm, and Eiza Gonzalez provide color and contrast to Baby's character, who is understated and subdued despite his vehicular antics.This is a fun ride. Especially if you enjoy style that supersedes substance.",8,2,6,27 July 2017
Grease," One Of Those Films You Can Watch Over And Over Again
","'Grease' is one of those films that I can watch over and over--and I do. Set in the doo-wop fifties, it centers on a group of high school seniors who share the joys and concerns of all teenagers: dating, popularity, first love, the unknown future, fitting in, sexual awakening.The two main characters, Danny (John Travolta) and Sandy (Olivia Newton-John) are the primary love story and the core of a great ensemble cast.One of the best things about this film is the music--a string of sing-able fifties-inspired gems that entertain and advance the narrative.There are also plenty of humor, fine dancing, and numerous references to fifties culture.'Saturday Night Fever' put Travolta on the track to film stardom and 'Grease' (released the following year) cemented his place among top cinema stars. Both films were co-produced by Robert Stigwood and their soundtracks (On RSO Records)made them huge successes in two genres.'Grease' is so dense with cultural references and appearances by 50s-era stars, that it takes multiple viewings to appreciate them all. Even Frankie Avalon drops in for a dreamy interlude.",10,10,11,22 June 2017
Cold Mountain," A Classic
","Cold Mountain tells of two people who struggle to survive during the Civil War--a young woman with no means of support and the young soldier who travels cross country to return to her. It's a story filled with heartbreak and joy, well told.Excellent direction is noticeable at every turn. The cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the beauty and the harshness of nature. The music fits the action and reflects the folk music of the times. The entire cast is wonderful.It is difficult to single out one actor in such a glorious cast, but Renee Zellweger's portrayal of Ruby really shines.Cold Mountain captures the feeling of this sad time in our nation's history and brings us into it. This is definitely one of the best films of its time.",10,1,2,26 February 2014
Duck Soup," The Marx Brothers In A Classic
","Released in 1932, 'Duck Soup' is surely one of the best Marx Brothers films, blessed with countless memorable lines and plenty of free-form comic insanity.The story takes place in the mythical country of Freedonia, where they are in need of a new leader. Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), who exerts some control over the nation's doings by virtue of being a sizable creditor, recommends Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) to replace the old ruler, who didn't measure up.Ms. Dumont, it should be noted, is the perfect foil for Marxian histrionics. If anyone doubts that being the straight person is a talent unto itself, they should watch the way she embraces the comedic lines with a flawless balance of understanding and disregard.The 'T' in Rufus T. Firefly must stand for timing. Groucho and his brothers Chico and Harpo let fly with wonderful streams of wordplay and puns that pass too quickly to notice them all on first viewing.Much of the humor in this film comes from tit for tat exchanges of physical affronts. Laurel and Hardy were also expert at this; see their film titled, appropriately, 'Tit For Tat'. Such humor later found its way into the pages of Mad Magazine in their 'Spy vs. Spy' features.This type of comedy is not everyone's cup of tea, but those who appreciate skewering by wordplay as much as swordplay should enjoy it immensely.",9,0,0,26 April 2016
Ender's Game," 'Independence Day' Filmed With Kids, From A Distance
","'Ender's Game' has some similarities to other films we have seen, with its use of the young-gun-learning-from-the-grizzled-gun-slinger motif (iike 'The Karate Kid') and the use of games to develop or recruit warriors (like 'The Last Starfighter'). And there are definite similarities to 'War Games'. But the protagonist (Ender) in this film is younger, making it harder to film convincingly.There was one scene where it felt silly to me that such young people were playing adult (military) roles, but otherwise I had no trouble accepting that premise. The film includes wonderful visuals, which could easily have been its downfall; but the real problem is the lack of exposition, which feels like the result of excessive editing. We need believable action based upon the psychology of the characters. 'Ender's Game' comes up short in this area. The viewer can, in his mind, stitch the scenes of the film together to make a decent whole, but the story is short-changed and it fails to achieve the level of quality it could have had.Despite its visuals, the story is essentially a morality piece, asking the viewer to process the choices that the protagonist makes on his quest to achieve his goal. It can be difficult to put the audience in the mind of the hero, but that is especially true when they are not given enough clues to his thought processes.This is a film worth seeing, but it could have been much more.",7,1,1,5 January 2017
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," A Dark Romp with Good Production Values
","This film is not classified in the 'comedy' genre, but you can consider it a dark comedy. We learn this early on, when we see glass milk bottles with ads for missing children strapped to them. But this is not a film designed for children.Once you decide not to take this film too seriously, you can accept the anachronisms (like shotguns) and just enjoy Hansel and Gretel for what it is--a special effects romp that has its tongue firmly planted in its cheek. Look for the references to Predator, The Matrix, Star Wars, Assassins Creed, and the entire genre that Underworld's Kate Beckinsale has established.There is not much depth in the story. And no surprises, really. But here is a list of things I liked about this film: *It's production values. Quality all around.*The fact that it was not difficult to follow the action, even during the dimly lit scenes.*The music, which was moody and sometimes drove the action.If you take this film seriously, then you will not be able to get past the fact that the witches have such tremendous powers that their enemies would have no chance against them.The most enjoyable aspect of the film is the troll--a masterpiece of design and invention, an enjoyable character.Sequels are on the way.",7,0,1,13 January 2014
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," This Is What An Action Film Should Be
","I saw this film on an IMAX screen and I'm glad I did. Although IMAX cameras were not used in the filming, I think the larger screen creates a more immersive experience and the sound was spectacular. But this film would be great in any format.'Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation' is one of the best action films I have ever seen. The story is clever and action packed. The photography is amazing and the music is fantastic.Much has been made of the stunt work, especially that done by Tom Cruise himself. It did not disappoint. And the action and chase sequences are as exciting as any I have seen.We can thank the writing for the well-defined and engaging characters. Some Bond films have villains that are rather cartoonish, but in MI:RN the danger feels real, helping to drive the suspense.The female lead, Rebecca Ferguson, deserves special mention. Her portrayal of Ilsa Faust is a wonderful blend of intelligence, beauty and strength and definitely one of the best in any action film. I can only hope she shows up in the next installment. some of the credit goes to the writers who created the character.In all, this film offers everything you want in an action film and deserves a '10' for its place in the genre.",10,129,209,31 July 2015
Spider-Man," The Birth Of Peter Parkour Extraordinaire
","Based on the Marvel comic series, this film follows the successful film adaptations of 'Superman' and 'Batman'. But whereas Clark Kent and Bruce Wayne assume their superhero mantles in adulthood, protagonist Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is a teenager in high school at the inception of his superhero saga, so his alter ego likewise is a young man, and his is a coming of age story.Peter is the narrator and he tells us up front that his story is 'all about a girl', so romance is integral to this film. We are introduced to the angelic-but-socially-needy Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). And the film launches into the origin story immediately, detailing the fateful day when our meek-mannered Peter's life intersects, improbably, with a unique arachnid specimen.Peter is given a competitor (James Franco) and an enemy/villain (Willem Dafoe). The story borrows heavily from traditional superhero/comic book lore, as well as traditional monster themes (see 'Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde' and 'Frankenstein'). And stylistically the film is grounded in comic book graphics and composition, which serves to lighten the drama and inject an element of camp.'Spider-Man' is set in New York City, and it often showcases known architectural landmarks to great effect, like the Chrysler Building and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. This is something that couldn't be done in Superman's Metropolis or Batman's Gotham.After a screen kiss that is now iconic, I was disappointed by the last twenty minutes of the film, which are steeped in melodrama, undercutting the dramatic action.The ending is a setup for the next installment. A twist redefines Peter's love for Mary Jane in an unexpected way.Because of its comic book roots, the film does not require extraordinary acting, but the cast is solid anyway. Though we never feel the fate of the world is in jeopardy, there are real emotions at play and the actors deliver believable portrayals. Kirsten Dunst is especially good in her role as Mary Jane, which is necessary to anchor the entire film. J. K. Simmons, as newsman J. Jonah Jameson, gets to chew the scenery in a delightful way.This is certainly a strong first act for encouraging viewers to watch sequels.",7,0,0,8 March 2020
Dunkirk," A Great War Story
","This is the story of a battle. It is not about the men in that battle. It is also about all battles.Some have criticized 'Dunkirk' because of its lack of character development. Other films have done a good job of following (developing) characters as they negotiate scenes of war. But this film chooses to focus almost exclusively on the chaos of war. Still, it is not without characters, and director Nolan has chosen to focus on a handful of individuals to explain the ways that fortunes can change amid chaos. He also uses a non-linear timeline. For some, Dunkirk stretched over interminable weeks. For others, their stories were encompassed by one harrowing day. Still others joined the fray only for hours. But all of them were subject to the drama of a countdown, whether it was due to small windows of opportunity, the unpredictable weather, or logistics.Hans Zimmer's music certainly drives the drama and helps accentuate the timelines that are at play. The soundtrack has a driving cadence overlaid by sounds that are like screaming sirens. The action is poetic. With minimal dialogue, we witness the transformative nature of war, the impossible choices, the drive for survival, the inhumanity that war requires. At times, the action is moving; at other times, it is overwhelming.Despite what some have written about this film, it is very true to the reality of Dunkirk. For example, the cranes that stand above the city actually were there. Seeing this film drove me to read about the precursors to this action. And to explore the stories of those who actually were there on that final day. Finally, it led me to better appreciate the great significance of that day in the history of the world.",9,2,4,27 April 2018
The Intouchables," Very Enjoyable Film Based On A True Story
","I found 'The Intouchables' to be a very enjoyable film, made even more so by the fact that it is based on a true story.The story is about an odd couple--a wealthy, older, paraplegic white man who seems to have little joy in his life, and a young, poor black man who doesn't take life too seriously.Each of them has something to offer the other. Through their relationship, which becomes a friendship and more, they each gain so much. Especially Philippe who, due to his immobility, has limited power to control his day to day activities.This can be called a comedy because of the light-hearted banter and jokes that are in it. But the banter and jokes help Philippe attain a more positive view of life--a touching and dramatic development.I enjoyed all the performances. I did think some story lines could have been developed more, but this is a small criticism when the overall film is excellent.",9,0,0,14 April 2014
The Lego Movie," Clever and Insightful!
","You can watch this film and enjoy the CGI effects that make it look like stop-action work with actual Lego blocks or claymation work. Even the water looks like it is constructed from Legos.Or you can also enjoy the many pop culture references. Many of them are related to films. So 'The Lego Movie' is easy to enjoy for anyone who enjoys movies. It also uses many film conventions (slo-mo action, romantic film scenarios, etc.). There are also references, visual and thematic, to such films/books as 'The Matrix', 'Transformers', and even 'Zaradoz' and 'Atlas Shrugged'.But from the first, this film shows itself to be so much more. It is not merely a satire of pop culture icons. It is a very pointed satire of political and social customs and conventions. Watching those little block-people in their block-world transcends the images themselves and in a graphic way the film presents glimpses into cultural truths that most of us can identify with. How much of my life is about following directions? How much of our culture is designed to make me feel good about the slot it wants to plug me into? How easily does the human brain allow its owner to fool himself, by distractions, into a false sense of individuality?You can enjoy the film on any of these levels. It is extremely well done. Some of the character voices fit their characters so well they are nearly iconic. This is animation, but it is not Disney. It has so much to say that children will not discern. And the action is nonstop so you may find yourself asking how 100 minutes could pass so quickly. Clever, clever, clever. If you liked 'Wreck-It Ralph', you should like 'The Lego Movie'.",9,0,2,19 July 2014
Inside Out," A Touching Film, Well Designed
","Obviously 'Inside Out' is not for everyone. Just look at the volume of negative reviews on IMDb. I must agree that this film is meant more for adults than children. The concepts are too sophisticated or abstract. But that is not a bad thing.I enjoyed this film very much. It must be recognized that undertaking this film was ambitious and risky. Ambitious because it could not have been easy to conceptualize characters that represent emotions and the 'world' they occupy. Risky, because the very concept of the film might not have attracted many viewers. Clearly they were trading on the stellar reputation that Pixar enjoys. Frankly, I was concerned that the film might have many hidden/subliminal messages about gender, societal roles, etc. But it does not. The focus of the film is enjoyment.One reviewer criticized the film's implication that we all are controlled by our emotions (and therefore do not have free will). I understand the concern, but there are other parts of the brain that control other operations, including motor skills, reasoning, etc. The film's depiction of memories shows how they affect our interactions with our environment. They enable us to learn (a process that involves evaluation and reason), but they are 'colored' by associated emotions. The internal world of 'Inside Out', where the emotions and other characters live and interact, is a triumph of imagination. They have mapped an environment where internal workings of the human brain reflect our knowledge of its operations with consistency. At the same time, it's a fun world which allows for an enjoyable storyline, though there are moments of suspense and sadness. In the past, Pixar has made us cry for the fate of toys and insects; now they have done it for emotions and memories.Speaking of touching moments...how about that dedication at the end of the credits: 'This film is dedicated to our kids. Please don't grow up. Ever.'",8,7,30,16 January 2016
Dirty Dancing," A Lovely Love Story
","I first saw 'Dirty Dancing' in the theater during its first release. I remember the hype surrounding the film--a kind of cautionary intrigue (not unlike that surrounding the release of 'The Exorcist'). I waited with great anticipation and I remember how captivated I was by the opening credits, superimposed over the dramatic and nearly abstract images that resolved into couples dancing.Since then, I have seen the film many times. It is a wonderful love story about a young woman who stumbles upon a magical world of dance and sensuality and is drawn to it, and to a charismatic dancer from less fortunate circumstances.The theme of the film concerns appearances and preconceptions based upon class and social station.Jennifer Grey plays the part of Baby, the young woman who learns to dance and who falls in love with Johnny (Patrick Swayze). Set against the summer season of a Catskill Resort, the story is filled with music of the period (1963) and from other periods, recreating a time that was pivotal in the loss of America's 'innocence' as well.This film deserves its huge following.",10,1,2,7 May 2015
The Dirty Dozen," A War Story About A Nearly Impossible Mission
","There have been plenty of films about small groups of soldiers pitted against superior forces or given special training to achieve a seemingly impossible task. And many of those films involved ragtag misfits given a chance to avoid far worse ends than death in battle.But 'The Dirty Dozen' is notable for its less biased portrayal of Americans at war. Unlike the war films produced during WWII, 'The Dirty Dozen' paints both sides of the conflict with the brush of realism. We see American soldiers commit crimes and act out of malice.Another notable aspect of the film is that one of the dozen was portrayed by Jim Brown, active NFL running back. As an Ohio native and a fan of Brown (and the Cleveland Browns), it was novel to see the athlete--certainly one of the best athletes of all time and the best running back ever by most accounts--on the big screen.The story, which portrays the hellish nature of war, including the slaughter of noncombatants, still has a humorous side. The dozen, who are recruited for a mission behind the German lines, have no respect for authority or discipline. Their recruiter (Lee Marvin) uses novel ways to gain their respect and to convince them that he values them as men and soldiers. On one occasion, he imports prostitutes into the training camp for their entertainment. And the men display cleverness and outside-the-box thinking (something most soldiers have drilled out of them) to prove their mettle and earn the chance to attempt the mission.As in detailed bank heists, Marvin trains his men thoroughly and tests them repeatedly. But things never go exactly as planned. During the mission, they have to be creative.In an odd way, this film probably appeals to those who like films of wartime and those who possess more anti-war sentiments. The all-star cast is largely responsible, though the story is certainly engaging.",8,2,5,28 May 2016
Wreck-It Ralph," Animation At Its Best!
","This is an animated film about game animation. It references everything from 'The Matrix' to 'Pong' to Japanese anime. It is one of the most imaginative films I have ever seen. Couple that with the fact that it features some great voice talents and amazing art work, and it is great viewing for anyone who appreciates gaming or animation.You know you are seeing great animation when the story covers all the emotional bases, including tearjerker scenes. How much talent does it take to get the viewer to invest in the relationships between cartoon characters so much that they are moved to tears? This is a great story that rivals any Pixar production, especially since it incorporates the stylings of each (real life) game it mimics.My favorite aspect of the game is Sarah Silverman's portrayal of Vanellope. I have read some other viewers' comments about not liking her voice, but she is delightful, especially since the animators used her expressions for the character as well. They did the same with Jane Lynch's character, Calhoun.There is nothing I can criticize about this game, which I enjoyed throughout. The credits are even worth watching. This film is a 10.",10,2,3,4 May 2014
The Transporter," Fun Action Film
","Frank is a simple guy. He only needs 3 rules to order his life. He is a loner with a Spartan lifestyle and he does not like complications. He transports objects for a fee, no questions asked. This is a job he is well suited for, especially since he is ex-military.One day, he violates one of his own rules. His life gets complicated very quickly. He loses a package. And someone tries to kill him. Frank's point A to point B life is sidetracked, primarily by the actions of a woman.This story might sound similar to Leon: The Professional, another Luc Besson film. There are many similarities, but The Tranporter suffers by comparison. The story of Leon has more humanity than Frank's, which has less human interaction and more martial arts scenes. The Transporter does not come close to the quality of The Professional, but if you like car chases and hand to hand combat reminiscent of Jackie Chan, it does a creditable job. There are plenty of improbable plot points, but they come with the territory.",7,0,0,29 October 2013
Avengers: Infinity War," Thanos Is Coming
","I have not seen all 21 films in the story arc that serves as the background for this penultimate episode in the MCU series that will soon culminate in 'Avengers: Endgame'. Seeing those films could only help, but it is not necessary. A general knowledge of the Marvel characters is probably enough to enjoy this wonderful spectacle.A complex villain named Thanos is determined to collect all six of the infinity stones, which would give him nearly infinite power. An extraordinarily large cast of Marvel superheroes combines forces to stop him. CGI is used in abundance to create a non-stop display of environments and conflicts.Like other Marvel films, the production relies on three major cornerstones to create an enjoyable experience:1. Comedy is used to offset the heavy emotional elements of the film. Sometimes this is achieved by juxtaposing grandiose speech with commonplace speech, often employing pop culture references.2. Suspension of disbelief is required in large doses to allow the writers to manipulate the epic elements of the story for conflict and dramatic effect.3. Larger-than-life environments are used for their wow factor.'Infinity War' has these three elements in spades. The plot requires our heroes to overcome nearly impossible odds, say 1 in 14,000,605. Disparate factions of the Marvel superheroes collection are introduced to each other in an all out battle. The film ends with the ultimate cliffhanger, especially considering that Marvel promises a grand conclusion that will reset Marvel's future forever.",9,0,2,25 April 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Tarantino The Storyteller Strikes Gold
","Quentin Tarantino is known for his love of pop culture. In 'Once Upon a Time,,,' he so captures the zeitgeist of an era through an abundance of details that I can recommend the film for that reason alone. The music of the time is the backdrop to this fairy tale based (in part) on fact.Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an actor with more misses than hits. He is awash in self-doubt and conscious of his place in Hollywood's pecking order. Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is Dalton's best friend and stunt double, happy to live in Dalton's shadow, but more self-confident than his buddy. Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie) is an actress on the verge of film stardom and wife of Roman Polanski. We follow these three characters through their daily activities, discovering their joys and their disappointments, their challenges and their successes. It's a mash-up of fact and fiction that is compelling to watch, especially if one is aware of the real events of 1969.The cast is studded with surprises and some hidden gems that are only revealed when reviewing the list of credits after the fact.There are two performances I wish to highlight. Margaret Qualley (daughter of Andie McDowell) plays Pussycat with an energy that lights up the screen. I last saw her portray Ann Reinking in Fosse/Verdon---a role she was suited for, but it lacked the brilliance she is permitted to reveal as Pussycat. Also, Julia Butters plays Trudi, a precocious 8-year-old who commands your attention as she acts opposite Leonardo DiCaprio.Tarantino's imprint is all over this film, stylistically and thematically. There is a real joy in watching him spin this yarn, leading the viewer to a denouement that can only be staggering, whichever path it takes.",10,34,61,7 August 2019
Gone Girl," A Cleverly Written Mystery
","Ben Affleck is Nick Dunne and Rosamund Pike is Amy Dunne in this story that is a mystery at times, a thriller at others. I love the way that the film's exposition leads the viewer to one conclusion, then another that is contrary to the first, then another. Eventually, the film becomes a commentary on public opinion and the media, even as it explores the complexities of an unusual marriage.The action starts with the disappearance of Amy, but the story evolves quickly. I have read other reviews that decry an abundance of plot holes, but I find most of them to be misunderstandings of the story. Others can be easily explained with some creative thinking. As a whole, the story is cleverly written.This film deserves its high score. The performances are strong, even in their moments of restraint. Rosamund Pike has cited Sharon Stone in 'Basic Instinct' as an influence and it is noticeable in her sometimes measured manner. Ben Affleck, at times, reminds one of the prototypical Hitchcockian hero-victim.The Reznor and Ross soundtrack is atmospheric, giving the film a suspenseful, unresolved feeling.",8,1,1,9 July 2018
Mr. Nobody," Put Your Thinking Caps On
","I prefer to think of 'Mr. Nobody' as a sequel to '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Thematically, it seems to follow several of the concepts from that movie, especially that time is not just linear; it consists of an infinite number of possibilities which all exist simultaneously.Since the film's action is also not linear, it leaves the story open to various interpretations. One could drown in the depths of hypothetical meanings, but it is best not to take it too seriously. The filmmaker would prefer it that way, I think. Note the way he makes the most of every opportunity to fool the viewer (e.g. the two motorcycles that look like a car in the distance).The film has a strong style, often using primary colors in the design and rather childish, primitive or whimsical symbolism (e.g. the foot crushing the house).Ostensibly, the main plot line involves a child (Nemo) who, before birth, was passed over by an angel who was supposed to remove all knowledge of the future from the child. When the child is nine, he has to make a choice between living with his father or mother, who are separating. Using his knowledge of the future, he quickly reviews the results of both choices and, finding neither choice leads to happiness (in chess, this is called zugzwang, meaning any possible move will worsen the situation) veers off at a crossroads.The film's story is recounted by Nemo in his future, at age 118. We see many of the various roads Nemo's life could have taken if various choice were made, or if chance had intervened.There are many homages or similarities to other films (and other cultural references), including 'The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Universe' and Monty Python.The acting is good, but I felt it was undercut by the editing, which sometimes feels like the scenes were shuffled randomly.I have to say 'Mr. Nobody' was beautifully filmed. Many of the scenes have to do with common life themes, so the older viewer might find himself swept back to scenes from his own life. The beautiful or nostalgic scenes are interspersed with scenes of tedium, however, so it's like a roller-coaster ride.Whether you want to see the film as dealing with the simultaneous existence of time paths, or you see it as a contemplation on choice/fate/randomness, this is a film that some will enjoy tremendously. Others, I think, will feel it is the fusion of philosophical ramblings and sci-fi mumbo jumbo.",8,9,13,7 May 2014
Django Unchained," Another Great Tale By Tarantino
","There is no doubt about Quentin Tarantino's ability as a storyteller. The narrative of 'Django Unchained' is further evidence of that ability, but his film-making abilities sometimes get in the way of the telling.Though Django (Jamie Foxx) is the film's protagonist, he is an unlikely partner to Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) and they share the lead. Each is a unique character, but they come to align themselves in common goals and, eventually, a common quest. The slave Django finds himself outside the law and--thanks to Schultz-- possessing freedoms that challenge his moral compass. But this is a Tarantino film, so the compass never strays far from a monomaniacal drive to achieve the completion of the quest. Tarantino graces the story, which is set in the antebellum South, with inherent humor, mostly achieved through the subtlety of Christoph Waltz's acting. His German bounty hunter executes a matter-of-fact demeanor in extraordinarily stressful situations.The story unfolds gracefully, allowing the viewer to discover background stories and motivations without unnecessary voice-overs or dialogue that is merely explanatory. This is done economically and clearly.However, the story later suffers from uneven pacing. This is distracting and reduces the effectiveness of the film. Likewise, some artistic choices take the viewer out of the narrative, including some quick camera zooms, excessive gore that goes well beyond Sam Peckinpah's style, and the use of a Jim Croce song in one montage.Tarantino has created an intriguing world that is unique, then cluttered it with extraneous attention-grabbing elements. This may be attributed to self-indulgence, but the viewer's indulgence is earned through the director's creativity and his obvious love for his creation.",7,0,2,13 June 2018
Frozen," A fun Disney tale of love, beautifully illustrated
","If you are a fan of the Disney-like animated movies, you should not be disappointed with Frozen.First of all, the artwork is amazing. Some very realistic and beautiful images of outdoor scenery. Some fantastical designs. (I did not see the 3-D version)Secondly, the voicings of the characters were excellent. I was already a fan of Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, Jonathan Groff and Alan Tudyk. But I did not realize that Kristen Bell has such a beautiful singing voice. The story is a drama that centers around two sisters, one of whom has a trait that might be considered a curse. As in all Disney films, there is plenty of humor to offset the drama. The romantic aspect is downplayed. I really feel that I would enjoy watching it a second time.",8,2,3,7 December 2013
Amadeus," A Great Film
","'Amadeus' is one of the great films of all time. It is a fictionalization of the later years of Mozart's life, though it does contain many actual happenings from his life.Mozart (Tom Hulce) is a musical genius who possesses some juvenile qualities. He is impetuous, immature, naïve, given to fanciful behavior. At the same time, he is a gifted musician and a driven composer. His marries a young woman named Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge), who proves to be dedicated to her husband. Wolfgang lives in the shadow of his father, Leopold (Roy Dotrice), who groomed him from an early age for musical success, escorting him throughout Europe where he performed for crowned heads and ecclesiastics. Mozart's devotion and desire for the approval of his father never waivers, even after Leopold's death.The story of the film is told--primarily in flashback--by Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), another composer in Vienna, a man who both worshipped and despised Mozart. This duality of feeling is the focus of the film. Salieri--more than anyone else--recognizes the genius of Mozart's work, but finds Mozart the man to be a repudiation from God, to whom he had dedicated his life. Mozart's vulgarity offends Salieri, causing him to vow enmity toward God.Everything about this film is superior: the music (naturally), the cinematography, the acting, the writing, the costuming, the makeup, the lighting, etc. The performance of Tom Hulce is brave. Jeffrey Jones, who plays Emperor Joseph II, shows why he may be the most underrated actor in Hollywood. F. Murray Abraham's performance is inspired.In at least three scenes, Abraham as Salieri describes Mozart's music with an adoration that is palpable, blessing the viewer with a rarefied experience. Through him, we experience the bliss that Mozart's genius permits. Mozart and Salieri have a complex relationship that 'Amadeus' explores beautifully. It certainly deserved the Oscar for Best Film.",10,0,2,3 October 2014
Coyote Ugly," Entertaining Film of a Young Woman Following Her Dream
","For me, 'Coyote Ugly' is worth watching because of Piper Perabo (who plays Violet). I am a fan, having seen most of her films and every episode of 'Covert Affairs'. She's the spunky girl who follows her dreams. The story is reminiscent of 'Flashdance'. Violet is a small town girl who wants to become a songwriter and/or singer, but suffers from stage fright.In order to survive in New York City, she takes a bartending job at Coyote Ugly--a rowdy, high-energy joint where the girls are expected to dance provocatively on the bar, sell as many drinks as possible, and appear available--where she discovers her inner chutzpah.The soundtrack is immensely popular and the music helps drive the action. Violet's singing is dubbed by LeAnn Rimes, who makes an appearance on screen. The film has a competent cast including John Goodman, Maria Bello, and others who are fun to spot.Don't think too much while watching this film. Just relax and enjoy the music, the energy, and the formulaic story of a young woman learning to make it on her own.The name (of the bar) Coyote Ugly is a monument to the concept of getting mindlessly drunk.",6,2,3,3 July 2014
The Longest Day," A Solid Retelling Of The WWII Normandy Invasion Story
","As the Germans waited in France for the inevitable invasion, the suspense on both sides of the channel was palpable. The British and Americans devised plans of great complexity, involving vast amounts of men and materiel. It was a guessing game where they would land and when. An element of surprise was achieved when the first allied forces appeared off Normandy--where they were not expected--on the tail of relentless rain, through fog banks over choppy waters.But the initial stages of the attack occurred during the previous night, when allied paratroopers descended over the French countryside. 'The Longest Day' does a good job of showing the confusion and mishaps that resulted from the night invasion. And it provides a glimpse into the unintended and accidental nature of war. The effectiveness of the invasion was affected by red tape, egos, poor communications, bad planning and mistakes--just like all wars.Though the film contains some factual errors, it does a good job (for its time) of conveying the true nature of armed conflict, where lives are often lost or saved simply due to chance.A large all-star cast and thousands of extras make this film noteworthy. Four directors under the direction of Darryl F. Zanuck were used to achieve balance in the film by serving the American, British and French interests in the story.For a more graphic representation of that beach invasion, see Spielberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'. But 'The Longest Day' is a fine film, especially for its time. The ending includes minimal moralizing and some good summarizing, but it feels like a sequel was envisioned. A television miniseries would certainly be welcomed if it could follow the stories of various participants on all sides of the conflict as this film does.",8,2,4,28 May 2016
Ex Machina," Thought Provoking and Beautifully Filmed
","'Ex Machina' is a thoughtful sci-fi film that raises questions about humanity and artificial intelligence. The pacing of the film--which is contemplative--might remind the viewer of '2001'. As a result, there are opportunities for the viewer to question what, exactly, he is seeing. Some characters appear to be dishonest, so it is reasonable to wonder what is true and what is a lie.The tone of the film, which I think is a major component of its viewing experience, is reminiscent of portions of 'Blade Runner'. The music contributes greatly to this impression. And the film investigates some of the same questions about humanity and self-perception.Caleb (Domhnall Gleeson) is selected to conduct an interesting experiment in artificial intelligence. His employer, Nathan (Oscar Isaac), brings him to a remote location to conduct the test over a week. We, as newcomers to the facility like Caleb, experience the happenings mostly through his eyes. We approach the same questions about those happenings as Caleb. We can only see what the writer/director allows us to see, just as the characters in the film can only perceive what their senses allow them to perceive, subject to the limitations imposed by circumstance.This is a beautifully photographed film that envelopes the viewer and leaves him in thought. It is well worth seeing.",8,1,5,30 April 2015
1917," 'Down to Gehenna or up to the Throne, He travels the fastest who travels alone.'
","A number of times while watching this film (on IMAX 2D) I wondered to myself 'Wow. How did they do that?' I did not dwell on those moments though, because the film has an insistent pace and is totally immersive.That immersion is due to some of the greatest cinematography and camerawork ever seen on film. Like an unflinching witness, the camera takes the viewer on the odyssey of its two protagonists. It is a seamless technical performance.Director Sam Mendes had a brave vision for this film, inspired by the war stories of his grandfather. He provides a visceral journey through hellish landscapes and labyrinthine obstacles. For me, this is one of the best films of all time.",10,1,5,2 February 2020
Big Hero 6," Technically Proficient and a Really Fun Ride
","Are we soon coming to a time when the truly life-like actions and representations of objects by animated films are taken for granted? I hope not.'Big Hero 6' tells the story of a young boy and his robot. And I hope no one is taking for granted the amazing 'cinematic effects' created via animation. These animators repeatedly fool the eye into thinking the images are created through the lens of a camera. To further this illusion, the point of view is what one might see through a camera. It is almost tempting to compliment the camera's movement, until you realize there is no camera. In the same vein, I love the 'shots' through translucent (but not clear) glass, the slo-mo, and the depth of field created by 'unfocused' objects in the background.The overall style of the film is reminiscent of anime and classic sci-fi. And it starts with a mystery that our hero (Hiro) cleverly--with the aid of a clue that is genius in its simplicity and design--sets out to solve.Time and again, the characters look and behave in very human ways. And since I am not yet ready to just accept such technical artistry as de rigeur, I say 'Bravo!'If you liked 'The Incredibles' or 'Wreck-it-Ralph', you will probably like 'Big Hero 6'.",8,37,54,8 March 2015
Dumb and Dumber," Carrey And Daniels Are Hilarious
","Certainly one of the funniest films of its time, 'Dumb and Dumber' stars Jim Carrey as Lloyd and Jeff Daniels as Harry, two clueless fools who are friends. The story starts with both men losing their jobs, then becoming involved, unknowingly, in a high-stakes criminal matter.Carrey fills the scenes with his usual rubber-faced antics and impressions. Daniels is up to the challenge, portraying the one who is likely the 'dumber' of the two. Laughs are plentiful, usually involving physical humor, visual humor, or the stupidity of characters.Lauren Holly plays Mary, the object of Lloyd's obsessions. (Holly and Carrey would later marry.)Much of the action involves a road trip, the setting for many other comedies. It doesn't disappoint. When they share the ride with a hitman, the results are hilarious.How dumb are these two? If you compare them to Steve Martin's 'The Jerk', they are more juvenile. If you compare them to The Three Stooges, they are in the same ballpark, but they rely less on pratfalls and are less manic. If you are looking for laughs, this film definitely delivers.",9,7,10,3 August 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy," Lovable Superheroes Strut Their Stuff
","Yes, this film is best suited for fans of science fiction. And if you are familiar with the Marvel universe, so much the better.In the early minutes of the film I noticed two things. One, that I was seeing something really interesting about every ten seconds. The images and the surprises just kept coming. Two, they did an excellent job creating the visual aspects of the characters, particularly the large, powerful characters. You see a big bad guy. Then you see a bigger badder guy. Then there is another awesome version of another forbidding character, etc.Although the CGI is quite impressive, I thought the best scenes were those that involved the main characters. Scenes of spaceships battling each other, while competently made, are not as interesting as those in which there is dialogue between characters.There is plenty of humor in this film. Some is worthy of out-loud chuckles. Rocket, the cantankerous raccoon, is predictably funny.I will definitely watch for the sequel.",8,1,3,2 September 2014
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Revenge Is Never A Straight Line
","Quentin Tarantino is certainly a cinephile's director. Many of the reviews that gut this film laud his abilities and his other works. An undeniably distinctive auteur, Tarantino is often criticized for self-indulgence, but that is what makes each of his works feel like a monument to a vision.'Kill Bill' feels like a schoolboy's dream about an unstoppable protagonist who faces impossible odds. Take Bruce Lee's 'Enter the Dragon', infuse it with the stylistic sensibilities of anime, and accent it with pop culture references, especially some strong musical numbers. The result is a personal saga that is the stuff of mythology.Uma Thurman is the nameless protagonist who virtually rises from the dead to seek a vengeance of desolation and mutilation. A perfect blade is fashioned for her mission, and it amplifies her lethality. Thurman gives a multi-leveled performance full of emotion and cold determination. She faces some strong adversaries and their minions, and she suffers through the terrible toll of her quest.Stylistically, KB plays with slo-mo, bold colors, silhouettes, and 'Crouching Tiger' physics. Tarantino uses angles and viewpoints effortlessly.In one of the film's best moments, Thurman faces off against Lucy Liu, circling to the strains of Santa Esmerelda's introduction to 'Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood'---one of the greatest dance tracks of all time. In a less subtle scene, she takes to the dance floor in a break-dance killing frenzy to 'Nobody But Me' by the Human Beinz.A major question for each viewer is: how much gore is too much? Tarantino never shies from depicting carnage and dismemberment. In fact, he glorifies it in this film which, for my sensibilities, is an unnecessary distraction and a tasteless extravagance. In one scene he creates a literal bloodbath (bath of blood). Consequently, this film is not for everyone.",7,8,10,28 April 2019
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Holy Buckets! A Magical Mystery Tour!
","Tim Burton's imagination produces, once again, images that are mesmerizing.Charlie & the Chocolate Factory is a multi-layered confection that serves simultaneously as an allegorical story for children and a pop culture cornucopia for adults.The first part of the movie concerns Charlie Buckets, a poor boy who is rich in familial love. He is one of five children who find golden tickets in their Wonka chocolate bars, allowing them to tour the Wonka factory. The other four are poster children for Spoiled Brat Syndrome.When the gates to the factory open to start the tour, it marks the second part of the film, much as Dorothy's entrance into Munchkinland. After that, the cultural references fly as fast as a glass elevator.Mr. Wonka, as played by Johnny Depp, is part Mr. Rogers, part Carol Channing, with just a smidge of Church Lady. But it's the factory--and its processes--that are the star of the film.Note the references to Shrek, Monty Python, Dr. Seuss, Busby Berkeley, Gulliver's Travels, Hair, Psycho, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Prince, The Beatles, Kiss, The Fly, The Beach Boys, and so much more. Much of it has a sixties-inspired Beatlesque style--an acid trip of psychedelic images. The actual story becomes secondary to the film's sensory stimulation. It's a visual and aural feast that is delightful. The special effects are seamless, the music inspired.",9,3,4,24 January 2014
The Graduate," A Haunting Classic
","It's true that 'the Graduate' is a timeless masterpiece. It is also a piece of its time. As someone who experienced the sixties like Benjamin Braddock (Dustin Hoffman), I have always recognized the film's ability to capture the zeitgeist of its time. Caught between changing sexual mores and the need to establish himself as a man, Ben feels unanchored. He is a product of his parents and his community, but he feels the need to break free of their stifling expectations.Ben seems to be collecting memories, not advancing toward any defined goals. He is, at his core, desperate. As the United States grapples with gender roles, racial upheaval, the onus of a wartime draft, and the ever-present threat of the cold war, Ben feels an anxious nation turning its expectant eyes to him and those of his generation.But Ben has no answers. He really has no idea where to begin to search for them. And so he is never running toward anything, always away. This is best exemplified by the final scene (which stands in marked contrast to the ending of 'Picnic', for example).Director Mike Nichols, aided by the lyric poetry of Paul Simon's music, has created a film that is simultaneously the quintessence of the sixties and a component of its creation. No pretty boy, like the others who were lined up to play his role, Dustin Hoffman eschews the part of the early-laurelled head being 'chaired through the market-place' and instead gives us an everyman performance that captures the world of possibilities and the falseness of that world's promises. We feel him struggle under the weight of 'eyes that fix you in a formulated phrase', like 'plastics'.This is a film classic for its content and its style, which do transcend a moment, taking the viewer to an uncomfortable place, perhaps, but it might be the beginning of a run to some place better.",10,1,1,3 March 2019
Singin' in the Rain," 'What A Glorious Feeling!'
","If you read about all the complications, detours, and personality conflicts that plagued the making of this film, it seems nearly impossible that the final result could be so enjoyable. But many films have braved a gauntlet of problems only to have the final product shine.The bones of this film--the story by the talented team of Comden and Green--is ingenious: A movie studio must adjust to the sudden success of talkies. This is a great setup for comedy and musical entertainment.'Singin' in the Rain' includes just about every element featured is musicals and it does them well: Chorus girls, a pas de deux by the leading couple, vaudeville-styled acts, a dream/ballet sequence, love songs, a nod to Busby Berkeley, and great dance solos.Fresh-faced Debbie Reynolds plays the actress (Kathy Selden) new to film who is championed by the matinée star, Don Lockwood (Gene Kelly). Donald O'Connor portrays Cosmo Brown, friend and comic relief.Cyd Charisse dances in Don's imagination of a musical show, and she is sublime. Jean Hagen is Lina Lamont, the beauteous silent film star with a voice like a caterwauling feline.It is very compelling when a cast performs at the height of its talents. This film contains so many iconic moments. Like the song says, 'That's Entertainment!'",10,0,0,5 August 2017
Elysium," Worth Seeing but Less Than It Could Be
","I saw Elysium in IMAX, so my review is only for that format.In a future where Earth is like the slums of Mexico City, the richest few have escaped to live on a satellite world. Our protagonist, played by Matt Damon is just another nobody in the overpopulated Los Angeles of 2154. The story is about his character trying to get to Elysium against seemingly impossible odds.Elysium is cut from the same cloth as District 9 (also directed by Neill Blomkomp). Both of them owe their gritty, industrial tone to Blade Runner.The idyllic world of Elysium is visually wonderful. I wish more of the action was set on that world. Perhaps viewers in 1939 felt the same way about the world of Oz, feeling that the bare glimpses of the Emerald City did not satisfy.The primary antagonist to Damon's character is Delacourt, played by Jodie Foster. Like Jack Nicholson in A Few Good Men, she is 'civilization's' line of defense against the enemies beyond the walls. She plays her part with an iconic stoniness that some might find annoying. I thought her acting was fine.One thing that I found distracting to the point of annoyance was the overuse of hand-held cameras. I want to be thinking about the action, not the cameras.The story itself is filled with action. That may be enough. But I wish I had cared more about the quest of our hero. Maybe I didn't because it was overshadowed by the political and social implications of the story. Not that it was preachy, but distracting. Imagine The Wrath of Khan if Captain Kirk were just one of a population of millions, not an individual who is a genius warrior with an unbending will.",7,4,8,9 August 2013
La La Land," A Hollywood Romance
","Why was 'La La Land' nominated for 14 Oscars, tying the most noms ever? It invokes the fantasies and feelings of many past musicals and numerous film romances. From its opening scene, I found myself noticing the nods to other films because of story or style, including 'Fame', 'Dirty Dancing', 'Moulin Rouge', 'The Way We Were'. 'Invitation to the Dance', 'An American in Paris', 'Funny Face', 'A Star is Born', 'A Chorus Line', and especially 'One From the Heart'--Coppola's musical in-studio masterpiece of camera techniques.It is easy to understand its popularity in Hollywood. Its views on acting as a profession are very relatable for actors.Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone play the romantic leads and are credible singers and dancers. Gosling even plays the keyboards for his part.Mandy Moore ('So You Think You Can Dance') provides the choreography, including duets for the two stars that are reminiscent of Astaire's work.Gosling plays a jazz musician, so the film's soundtrack has a jazz-infused sensibility that reminded me of Swing Out Sister's 'Breakout'. Two of the songs written by the Hurwitz/Pasek & Paul team are nominated for Oscars. One won the Golden Globe, though personally I prefer the other.Will 'La La Land' win all 14 nominations? No, but it has a shot at as many as 9. For those who love romantic films, well-made, it is a joy to experience. The ending of the film provides a surprise twist that expounds on the film's conception of life (and love) as cinematic experience.",9,3,9,14 February 2017
Groundhog Day," A Truly Great Romantic Comedy
","One of the great films, 'Groundhog Day' is a satisfying romantic comedy that also works as an exploration of existential and philosophical concepts.Phil (Bill Murray) is a Pittsburgh weatherman who must cover the Groundhog Day festivities for the fourth year in a row. He reluctantly travels to Puxatawney, PA with cameraman Larry (Chris Elliott) and new producer Rita (Andie MacDowell) to record the antics of Puxatawney Phil. After they get there, he is caught in a time loop, making him relive February 2nd over and over.Before he goes to Puxatawney, Phil is tired of his boring life. To him, it feels like everyday is the same--more clouds, more precipitation, more cold fronts. He is abrasively sarcastic and genuinely depressed.When he is forced to live a life where literally everyday is essentially the same, he learns to appreciate the small things. And he realizes that he is the primary variable in his own life; it is up to him to appreciate the little things and to make the most of his time.The script is terrific. Not only does it hold together on scrutiny, it is touching and funny. Bill Murray straddles the line between humorous and meanness perfectly, affecting a transformation that is believable. Andie MacDowell does a good job portraying a woman who is essentially romantic and optimistic, but wary of Phil's intentions. Chris Elliott is self-deprecating and perfectly tuned to his role as an immature schlub.I know I am not alone in saying I have watched 'Groundhog Day' so many times I have lost count. Its appeal is so great, it easily bears rewatching, like 'The Wizard of Oz'. In my estimation, Bill Murray has two of the top comedies of our time with 'Groundhog Day' and 'What About Bob?'",10,1,2,3 February 2016
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino Makes His Mark
","Quentin Tarantino's first film of consequence and the film that introduced him to the masses, 'Reservoir Dogs' bears all the hallmarks of what we have come to expect in Tarantino films.Pop music plays a role, sometimes as background music, sometimes voiced by characters. Violence is a central theme, often gratuitous and gory, like a Peckinpah film. Vulgarity is common, though this can be attributed to accurate character writing. His characters like to tell stories, allowing Tarantino the writer to express his enjoyment of a well-told tale.But what makes this film a significant contribution to cinema canon is its style, particularly the way Tarantino frames scenes. It also includes interesting, quirky characters that engage the viewer and keep him guessing.That said, this film is not for everyone. Particularly those who abhor cinematic violence. The dialogue is also heavily sexist, racist and anti-gay (in accordance with the nature of the central characters).Viwers might ask themselves if Tarantino, as writer and director, is trying to deliver a message or a moral, or if he is merely including all of the film elements that he personally enjoys? Viewing his later films suggests that the latter is true.",7,0,0,20 April 2017
The Great Raid," A Stirring Film Grounded In Reality
","Filmed in a style reminiscent of war films from the 40s and 50s, 'The Great Raid' is a moving tale that reminds us of the terrible costs of war. Based on a true story, it depicts the mission to save 511 men in a Japanese POW camp.Though no one actor rises very far above the overall cast, which is substantial, the acting is convincing. The pace of the film varies, depending upon the part of the story--just as it would in real life. From the prisoners' points of view, the length of their ordeal was interminable. From the point of view of their rescuers, there was a countdown to tragic failure always pushing the action.The addition of a romantic story is a poignant reminder that each and every soul at risk was connected to others. This adds emotional depth. The montage of historical footage during the end credits is a wonderful aspect of this film, stirring feelings of both triumph and sadness.The scope of the tragedy of war lies in the fact that the losses depicted in this film were actually multiplied a thousand fold, on battlefields around the world and in prison camps across the Pacific and in Europe. And also in the hearts of millions of survivors spanning the globe.",8,2,2,21 October 2018
Eyes Wide Shut," A Classic
","One of the most underrated films of all time, 'Eyes Wide Shut' is the result of an intense collaboration between Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman and Stanley Kubrick. Its title suggests an elusive meaning, a conundrum. And that is what the film delivers as presented from the viewpoint of its protagonist, Dr. William Harford (Tom Cruise).Kubrick delivers a visually stunning piece of cinema---with its striking emphasis on color and light---wrapped around an odyssey that is laid over a tale of domestic disquiet. Just as some films include numerous memorable quotes, EWS includes numerous images that stick with you forever.The theme of the film is about the structures of society and its conventions, like marriage, which overlay the raw realities of the human psyche. It is a film of manners that lies like a thin veneer over the uncertainties and brutalities of uncivilized man that always lurk where we dare not look. But EWS dares and provokes us to follow its exploration of the seams of civility, the indulgences that few can afford. It seems to say, like Eliot'sPrufrock, 'Let us go then, you and I...' I refer you to the rest of that stanza which seems so relevant here.The film also has a cadence that draws you in. Moments of calm and enchanting certainty are punctuated by scenes of confusing happenstance and a nagging insistence that some upheaval impends. Dream-like beauty always seems to be on the verge of interruption. This is a meditation on the investments and sacrifices we make to achieve happiness, success, or the tranquility of perceived certainty.EWS includes some wonderful supporting performances in addition to its captivating starring roles. Particularly noteworthy is the performance of Leelee Sobieski, who plays a girl of mysterious circumstances and intentions.Perhaps one day this film will sit atop the popular lists that enshrine the best of cinema where it deserves to be.",10,0,0,2 March 2020
Beauty and the Beast," An Enjoyable Film, But Disney Can Do Better
","There are a plethora of one- and two-star reviews for this film on IMDb. That signifies the film is worthless or nearly worthless, providing no entertainment. This is a radical position to take, especially when its accumulative rating is (currently) 7.8, indicating that many people were entertained.That does not mean, however, that the film is perfect or that it could not be better.The story is about the transformative power of love. Being a musical, the viewer should expect romance and music. The music is an established commodity. But how does the film realize the characters, the story, and the action?I enjoyed Emma Watson as Belle. Her singing voice is more than satisfactory and her acting fits the character. The other primary character--the Beast--is more problematical. His CGI face takes the viewer away from the action and disconnects the two romantic leads. Also, the movement of the Beast sometimes looks weightless, as if the he does not have a large and ponderous presence, which undercuts the menace he is meant to project.I enjoyed the scenery and I think the camera work was very well done. Being a Disney fairy tale, we expect more than music and romance; we expect enchantment. The overall effect of the film is enchanting: the depiction of the town of Villaneuve, the renderings of the interiors, the Beast's castle, the landscapes, and the music, of course. There are genuine moments that tug at the heartstrings, that jerk at the tears.The Beast's facial CGI impacts the emotional content of his scenes somewhat, but the film still delivers the Disney moments of heartbreak and resolution.",9,4,8,24 April 2017
Sicario," A Shadowy, Intense Film of Suspense
","'Sicario' starts with a dramatic scene of police in action. At first, the viewer is ignorant of what is going down; then the story comes into focus and revelation after revelation changes the viewer's understanding as the tension ratchets up.Kate Macer (Emily Blunt) is a seasoned FBI agent with experience in kidnapping cases and she is part of the team in that first action, as they invade a house where they believe hostages are being held. In the wake of that mission, she is given a chance to work with a task force with obscure authority. They promise her an opportunity to bring down those who were responsible for the deaths of two of her colleagues.As Kate enters the shadowy world of the War on Drugs, she is a witness, our surrogate, our eyes. The deeper the story goes, the more the operations feel outside authorized legal parameters. And Kate, who has always operated strictly within her authority, feels more nervous. Also on the task force is Alejandro (Benicio Del Toro), a quiet, inscrutable man who is intense. We eventually discover his background, his intentions, and his loyalties. That is the real story of 'Sicario', though it is also about Kate's journey and her education (and ours).It is tempting to write about the political ramifications of the film's story, but that would reveal too much. I will only say that the prime movers in the shadowy world of 'Sicario' are granted their powers by those who purport to despise them.Much of the film's atmosphere, and its suspense, are the result of superior photography and a wonderfully moody score. The acting is--like the story and the scenery--sparse but elemental to the film's tone. It is easy to see why 'Sicario' is considered one of the best films of this year.",8,1,2,22 January 2016
Les Misérables," I hoped for more
","First let me say that I have seen the Broadway musical three times over the years. When performed well, the play is a moving experience filled with memorable moments of music.I found the movie to be a disappointment, probably because I expected (hoped for) so much. It's not a bad film, but I think it could have been more.The idea of live singing is a noble experiment. In some cases, it lends authenticity to the performances and melds the singing with the emotions. But, I think, it required rephrasing of the songs to make them more realistic. In doing that, it compromised the emotional impact of the songs.I really enjoyed the realization of Paris and the surroundings of the story. The costuming other production values were excellent. However, choices in editing and camera work were distracting. One should not be so overtly aware of these choices.In the end, I wish the director had dubbed in voices for two performers. Russell Crowe's Javert is a strong presence in the film, but his voice simply did not convey the same strength. And Cosette's (adult) voice could have been stronger.I recommend the film, but I wish it had been more powerful. Compare Baz Luhrman's Moulin Rouge, where he used actors, not Broadway performers, but managed to create a powerful experience. Some might say he overproduced the songs, but the music was stirring and carried more emotional impact than the naturalistic renditions in Les Mis.",7,0,1,25 January 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Densely Packed And Richly Depicted Sci-Fi Fun!
","I strongly recommend this film, if only for the CGI and special effects. In terms of visuals, this is the richest film I have seen. Between the characters, the backgrounds and the effects, it is sometimes difficult to take all of it in. This is a film that requires multiple viewings if one wants to appreciate all of its magic. I think I will watch in 3-D next time.It starts with a battle scene that is actually funny, thanks to Baby Groot. The alien creatures are among the best ever depicted in a film, outdoing 'Star Wars', for example. One alien race is absolutely beautiful.The music, of course, is a focus--as in the original GOTG--and the choices are again toe-tappingly infectious.Watch through the end credits. This film is densely riddled with imagery and references that make it as fun as it is impressive. The irreverence of the first film is abundant in this installment as well.",9,1,3,2 June 2017
Zombieland," This Parody Of Zombie Films Is So Much Fun
","Jesse Eisenberg plays a socially inept, neurotic young man who has survived a zombie apocalypse. He also narrates much of the film. The result is a parody of zombie films that feels similar to some early Woody Allen films.'Zombieland' is grossly gory and tongue-in-cheek. It pays homage to many films of the zombie genre and dozens that are not. Surprisingly funny, its humor is spot-on and effective, helped by a strong cast that includes Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin.The script hits the right notes continually, whether they are comedic or tender. And each twist feels right, keeping things interesting. The film never lags; it just shifts into a different gear.This is a surprisingly fun film and it feels like it would stand up to repeated viewings.",8,14,19,10 February 2017
The Bridge on the River Kwai," A Classic Story and Brilliant Acting
","'The Bridge on the River Kwai' is, as others have said, an anti-war film. It concerns the struggle between a British officer, Colonel Nicholson (Alec Guinness), who is confined with his men in a Japanese POW camp, and the Japanese commander, Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa), who has orders to finish a section of railroad using prisoner labor.The conditions in the camp are brutal. The tropical sun makes for punishing working conditions, especially for men whose health has been compromised by injuries, punishment and jungle diseases. Despite the hardships, Nicholson is dedicated to proving the superiority of the British will. He is an admirable figure, but he has one fatal flaw.The other major character is Shears, an American naval officer whose knack for self-preservation helped him survive Saito and the sun before Nicholson's men ever marched into the prison camp. Shears is a cynic who is dedicated not to military rules and regulations but to his own welfare. He views Saito and Nicholson from the sidelines. Like Puck, he seems to say 'Lord what fools these mortals be.'Shears is the most complex character in the film. He makes decisions that might appear contrary to his basic nature. As such, the role of Shears can be viewed as a companion to William Holden's performance as Sefton in 'Stalag 17'. Sefton is a prisoner in a German POW camp. Like Shears, he is cynical and pragmatic. Viewers might find elements of heroism in the behaviors of Nicholson, Shears or Saito, depending upon their points of view. Regardless, the story of 'The Bridge on the River Kwai'--from the novel by Pierre Boulle-- is fascinating. David Lean's direction pays attention to so many details, creating a vivid world that envelopes the characters and makes the jungle a significant character itself. His framing of the final scenes (and some brilliant editing) create an ending filled with suspense and blinding insight.",10,3,4,5 March 2016
Edge of Tomorrow," An Enjoyable Sci-Fi Story
","'Edge of Tomorrow' is first and foremost an action film. I saw the film in IMAX 3-D. It really does present a spectacle. The special effects are second to none.Like the film 'Groundhog Day', there are significant humorous elements. These manage to keep the tone fairly light despite the ominous theme of the story.Tom Cruise and Emily Blunt portray likable characters. This makes it possible to invest one's feelings in what happens to them.The most critical part of the film is the story, which keeps you guessing. At one point, I thought it's was going to be really difficult for the writer(s) to resolve the dilemma of the protagonist without it seeming cheesy, but it was resolved without losing any of the film's integrity. That's good writing.The supporting cast does a great job of adding to the experience. Since the story has some repetitious aspects, it is important that they be convincing.I would recommend this film to any sci-fi fans.",8,2,4,12 June 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," Plenty Of Talent, But Mostly Wasted Here
","A film that is based upon a true story should not feel contrived, but director Martin Scorsese has created a film that diverges so far from reality by its very construction that it feels indulgent. The main character, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), narrates ad nauseum throughout the film. Early on, we see a red sportscar. Belfort says he didn't actually drive a red car; his was white. This might be an attempt at playfulness, but it serves to undermine the veracity of the script. And the viewer is left wondering for what purpose.Belfort is a worthless human being, devoid of decency. As such, he is one-dimensional. He seems to exist solely as an object of hate for the audience. His self-analysis consists of pronouncements designed to shock, like the rebellious declarations of a teenage hooligan. 'I love drugs,' he says, as if his drug-fueled debauchery splashed over every frame of the film is not enough evidence.It is said that Scorsese encourages his actors to go off-script, that he likes adlibbing. That seems to be the case here, and the result is an unconvincing parody.One performance worth celebrating is Margot Robbie as Naomi, Belfort's wife. Once again she demonstrates she is one of the best actors of her generation. The over-the-top performances of other actors only serve to emphasize her solid depiction of a believable character.I cannot recommend this film, but those who see Wall Street as a villainous, monolithic agent for evil might enjoy its cartoonish aspects.",4,0,1,5 February 2020
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," What Might Have Been
","First let me mention what I like about this film. Christina Applegate was funny, beautiful, and spot on in her characterization. I also like the work of Fred Willard and Chris Parnell.Many viewers have rated this comedy highly. I did not find the film that funny. This is a matter of taste. I just did not think some of the premises on which the comedy was based were that funny. And some of the gags were limp.Let me give an example of something that I felt could have been better. Ron Burgundy is known to read anything that appears on the teleprompter. Great premise. But in the film, this comes up only twice--and in both cases, it's a one line joke that is rather mild. I can't help thinking that they could have had a blast having him read specious copy, probably at the hands of an enemy or a practical joker.I also felt that when the film strayed into the absurd (ala Monty Python), it fell flat. With the comedic talent involved, this film could have been so much more. I did enjoy parts of it. But I would not recommend it to others. Obviously, many viewers enjoy this film, but I have to give it a lukewarm rating.",5,0,0,9 October 2013
The Wrestler," Great Writing, Brilliant Acting
","'The Wrestler' is a superior film that I would recommend to anyone. It is a character-driven story performed by a superior cast well-suited to their parts.The central story is about two people, Randy 'The Ram' and Cassidy, two well-crafted characters who have mismanaged their lives and have to deal every day with the realities that come with that.Randy is portrayed by Mickey Rourke in a tour de force performance that blurs the lines between the character and the actor. 'The Wrestler' is a comeback movie for Rourke, who bravely allows himself to be as vulnerable as an actor can be in depicting the washed-up wrestler. Randy still dresses and styles himself as the ring headliner of many years ago. His living quarters also reflect the lifestyle of a young man, though his face and body--bearing the scars of old battles--belie the truth. As age ravages his physical abilities and he is forced to face his own mortality, he tries to reenter the life of his estranged daughter. He also struggles to connect with a woman who is facing her own demons.Cassidy, portrayed by Marisa Tomei, is a stripper who also must face the realities of her profession. Both of them are performers who daily fight Time to remain in professions designed for young people. Cassidy, like Randy, has the emotional scars of a long battle. She feels dehumanized by her job and, resignedly, recognizes the continuing reality that men do not see her as a real woman or a mother (to her young son). Marisa Tomei, as usual, finds the heart of her character and exposes it for the audience.The film does a good job of placing these characters inside a world that is ruthless in its dehumanization of people. Randy takes a job at a grocery. The scenes in which his a**hole boss exacts his petty tokens of fealty are written with understatement and such an ear for truth. Some of the scenes of Randy manning the deli counter are with non-actor customers of an actual store.'The Wrestler' brings to the screen some of the toughest realities of life. The action is perfectly set in some real New Jersey locales, where Asbury Park and other locations have buildings and venues that are reminders of heydays long past. While the film celebrates the survivor instincts of Randy and Cassidy, it focuses on the demeaning trivialities of life and the undeniable degradation of time.",9,0,0,9 April 2014
Hancock," Falling Short Of Heroic
","What would you call someone who is bad-mannered, foul-mouthed, destructive, homophobic, unreasonable, and drunken who is a liar and an asshole? Probably not a superhero. Will Smith plays Hancock, a slacker with all those attributes who also has supernatural powers. Maybe you could call him a superzero--someone with the potential to be spectacular who falls far short.He's a reluctant hero for sure, who usually rises above his crassness only when forced to, and then leaves careless destruction in the wake of his heroics.He meets Ray (Jason Bateman), an optimistic PR man who thinks Hancock should change his image. Ray's wife, Mary (Charlize Theron), seems unconvinced. What follows is an unpredictable story about love and possible redemption. There are bad guys, of course, who complicate matters, but the resolution of this story feels messy and contrived. By the end of the film, viewers may feel like it was all just an origin story that served no purpose except to be the foundation for other real stories to follow. But who would want to emotionally invest in a hero that still feels less than realized, a temporary patchwork of questionable values?One feels that an opportunity has been missed. Imperfect heroes can be quite interesting if their story makes them lovable or compelling. Hancock strains to achieve either.",6,0,1,19 September 2017
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," A Spectacular Battle
","First of all, I would not recommend this film for anyone who has not seen any of the other films in this series (including the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy). Knowledge of the characters is critical to fully understand the action.This film is a spectacle. When Peter Jackson decided to make 'The Hobbit' a trilogy instead of a two-part story, it meant that this episode would be primarily a battle. So it is well named. And the battle provides what most viewers want to see in a battle--hordes of formidable warriors, with the ante constantly being upped.I enjoyed 'The Battle of the Five Armies' not only because the action is spectacular, but because the sets and scenery are creative and awesome. Also, the story of the battle is multi-layered, with a number of confrontations between foes.Lastly, the CGI--which is responsible for most of what I have mentioned--is clean and convincing. I did not watch in 3-D or on the IMAX screen and they were not necessary for an entertaining experience.",7,1,5,15 January 2015
Bring It On," A Teen Flick With Spirit
","Those who think of cheerleading only as it relates to game day rooting from courtside or the sidelines will find this film a good introduction to competitive cheer, where cheer teams compete, using aspects of gymnastics and dance as well as encouragements of audience spirit.The story is about a suburban cheer squad that has to redefine itself in the face of the year's biggest competition. The usual teen tropes are included, so it warrants a C-plus for originality. There is plenty of angst, but no acne.But some good cheer choreography gives the film credibility. And a great message about good sportsmanship (when the team captain takes steps to assure that they will compete against the best) elevates the film.Another plus is the trio casted for three central roles: Kirsten Dunst, Eliza Dushku, and Gabrielle Union.",7,0,0,25 May 2020
The Good Shepherd," A Great Cast, A Disappointing Result
","Disappointing. What else can you say about a film that is much less than the sum of its parts? Second-time director Robert DeNiro does a credible job with this story about the CIA and the inner rot and sickness that must result from an organization based upon secrecy and lies. But the story itself lacks drama as told.Sporting one of the greatest casts ever assembled, 'The Good Shepherd' follows predictable plot lines and regurgitates the commonly accepted history of an organization that seeks to make laws, not follow them. How can you lower your expectations when a film features Matt Damon, Angelina Jolie, Alec Baldwin, Robert De Niro, William Hurt, Timothy Hutton, Gabriel Macht, Lee Pace, Joe Pesci, Eddie Redmayne, John Turturro and others?Damon's character, Edward Wilson, is at the center of every scene. He is played as a solitary, emotionally-detached, emotionless drone who feels more like a victim than a perpetrator. The plot is disjointed. And, perhaps more importantly, it lacks a point of view. Not that we need to be told what to think, but a film that lacks a consistent or comprehensive viewpoint is like a ship without a rudder: it will travel and it will arrive at a (random) destination, but the journey will reveal little except that winds blow.Edward Wilson certainly is a character buffeted by the winds, but they are mostly winds of unknown origin and hidden intent. It's a story that rings true, but it is uncompelling.",6,1,2,28 June 2017
Finding Dory," Another Hit By Pixar
","First the negatives: 1) I found the first half hour of the film boring. 2) I have concerns that the film might be too scary for younger children, so ask others who have seen it first to determine if your child can enjoy it. 3) Some parts of the plot felt meandering. 4) Some aspects of the story felt like clichés (and very reminiscent of 'The Wizard of Oz'). Not every aspect of the story must be original, but this felt particularly derivative.That said, I enjoyed the film after the first thirty minutes. I especially thought it picked up when the characters voiced by Ty Burrell and Ed O'Neill ('Modern Family' costars) entered the story,Pixar's animation, as usual, is tremendous. Some of the sequences feel like 'Mission Impossible' and they are rendered with inspiration.Watch for Gerald, who steals the show during the brief scenes when he is on screen.",7,0,3,1 December 2016
Arrival," No Spoilers For This Great Sci-Fi Film
","Adapted from a story by Ted Chiang, 'Arrival' is an intelligent sci-fi adventure about a linguist (Amy Adams) and a physicist (Jeremy Renner) who are tasked with solving a puzzle of international import.The story is really quite remarkable and its telling is even more remarkable, mostly because it's a story that would be extremely difficult to film with clarity. But screenwriter Eric Heisserer and director Denis Villeneuve have created an enthralling film of subtlety and power.First there was 'Close Encounters'. 'Arrival' picks up where 'Close Encounters' leaves off. And like 'Close Encounters', it possesses that magical feeling of anticipation and hope. It is thrilling to watch the mystery unfold (like reading Poe's 'The Gold-Bug' as a child).The music, by Johann Johannsson, strikes just the right chord as does the cinematography, with its claustrophobic intensity.This is one of the best films of the year and a worthy addition to the canon of science fiction films.",10,3,16,18 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," One of the best of its time
","After years of hearing people praise this film, and occasionally catching snippets of it on TV, I made a point of renting the film.The Shawshank Redemption comes from a Stephen King story and has elements that might remind one of Stalag 17 or Cool Hand Luke. But this movie is an original gem. It is a tribute to man's indomitable spirit. And it shows the importance of hope--even in the lives of men who have been institutionalized by an uncaring society via the prison system.Two things that make this film greater than others in the genre are:1. A villain that personifies evil so completely. The warden is made more villainous by his avowed dedication to Christian principles.2. The excellent screenplay creates 'mini-mysteries' throughout by allowing the viewer to consider what happens at certain times, then revealing the unexpected truths. This engages the audience, and creates twists that entertain.This film deserves the hype it gets.",9,0,0,22 July 2013
Parasite," A Visual Treat
","This film was the winner of the Palme D'Or at Cannes. One can imagine a lengthy standing ovation being given by the elite, wealthy, rich attendees who wished to laud this condemnation of their ilk. Clearly, that is what some reviewers garnered from their viewing of this interesting film. But on the other hand, there are others who view this film as a balancing act, where there is no clear hero or villain. As such, it is a film that asks more questions than it answers.One thing is certain: this film is a visual treat. Its portrayal of wealthy society and poorer culture pays great attention to detail. Spaces are wonderfully composed and scenes are so well framed, it is tempting to get lost in the visual details.But there is a story to tell and it is compelling, even if it is sometimes confusing or even inconsistent. The point of view of the director is unclear until the ending. And even then, one wonders about the final lines, which might contradict what has gone before. The best clues to the intent of director Bong Joon Ho are his earlier films, like 'Snowpiercer' or 'Host', which feel less ambiguous.",7,2,5,19 November 2019
Wonder Woman," Gal Gadot Is The Perfect Choice
","An origin story with roots in Greek Mythology, 'Wonder Woman'--told in flashback memory--begins with the child Diana leading an idyllic life on a beautiful hidden island. The princess becomes an Amazon warrior and, when her world is sullied by the ways of belligerent men, she undertakes a mission to set the world right.Her venture into the surrounding world is a fish out of water story that becomes a love story, while still retaining its focus on her crusade. She learns about herself in the process and the viewer is treated to a morality tale about the nature of man. A superhero emerges, fit to carry a franchise.The main strength of the film is Gal Gadot, the Israeli actress who plays Diana with conviction and vulnerability. She can handle the physicality of the role and still show an empathetic face when presented with the injustices of the world. She is the perfect choice for the role.Chris Pine is solid in his portrayal of the pilot who stumbles into Diana's life journey. A few of the supporting players feel like they are shoe-horned into the story for reasons that do not serve the story. As a result, they are underdeveloped.By the story's end, Wonder Woman has come into her powers and the stage is set for some potentially wonderful adventures.",8,5,14,17 July 2017
Paths of Glory," A Masterpiece about Military Incompetence and Immorality
","Kubrick's Paths of Glory, as has been reported by other reviewers, is a masterpiece of film making. The acting is excellent. The camera work is extraordinary. The script is lean and powerful.It also conveys a powerful message. It may be an anti-war message, but I think it is, more accurately, a message about the officers who advance through the ranks via military politics and who lead others even though they themselves are morally bankrupt.One must inevitably compare the movie to Breaker Morant, another film about military leadership, including courtroom scenes and three defendants. One could think that Breaker Morant owes much to Paths of Glory, but Breaker Morant is based upon a true story from the Boer War. As good as Paths of Glory is, Breaker Morant is one of my favorite films. I think it has more depth of emotion.But Paths of Glory is a must see.",9,0,1,30 August 2013
Blade Runner," Sci-fi Noir
","When 'Blade Runner' was released, it was not very successful at the box office, but some viewers recognized it for what it was--a stylish sci-fi noir. Harrison Ford plays the retired blade runner Rick Deckard, whose job is to eliminate rogue/illegal androids. A handful have escaped to Earth, so Deckard is drafted to end the threat.This film served as the blueprint for many dystopian films to follow. Director Ridley Scott's future Los Angeles is dark, oily, rain-soaked, and smoky. A blend of the old and the new are fused in the gritty Sino-American culture that is ground-level LA, far below the forbidding, soaring towers that house the powerful.The wonderful cast includes Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh and William Sanderson. Their quirks and passions add a vibrancy that is lacking in their environment, though it is rich in detail.The pace of the film is leisurely, as if Scott wants the camera to linger over every facial expression, every moment, every ephemeral object. It takes us inside Deckard's vulnerabilities, down dark alleyways of decay, and even reveals the hidden reflections of a photograph.In the end, 'Blade Runner' is a contemplation of mortality. Adapted from a novel by Philip K. Dick--a model for many other sci-fi films to follow--it immerses the viewer in an alternate world that feels both real and unreal, and cleverly asks more questions than it answers.",10,2,4,9 October 2017
Identity," Worth Watching
","It is a dark and stormy night. A series of incidents brings a group of strangers together in a remote, dilapidated motor inn. Already, a feeling of doom encompasses the soggy sojourners, but then things get really weird.'Identity' is a rather formulaic murder mystery with a compelling tone that is aided by moody incidental music and strong camera work. The story plays on the viewer's expectations, but takes things to another level when the facts don't seem to add up. Thus, another level of mystery is added, and its basic 'And Then There Were None' outline becomes much more complicated.An interesting cast, highlighted by John Cusack--- as Ed, a limo driver diverted from transporting an actress because of a flooded road and an unfortunate accident---does a fine job. Director James Mangold delivers an economical story that moves briskly, keeping the audience in a constant state of surprise.Some may find the ending a letdown, but this is one of those films that will have you reconstructing everything in your head afterwards.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
The Producers," The First Mel Brooks Film Is Comedy Fun
","Mel Brooks' 'The Producers' is a comedy that revolves one central idea: that it might be more profitable to produce a flop than to produce a successful play.Zero Mostel plays Max Bialystock, an over the hill producer who lives on a shoestring. When he meets Leo Bloom (Gene Wilder), a neurotic but straight-arrow accountant, the two form an unlikely partnership. Object: failure.The film has a manic beginning with plenty of hyperventilating, but soon settles into what filmgoers would later come to recognize as a trademark Brooks' wackiness. This is Mel Brooks' first film as a director and one can hear his (writing) voice in many of the lines.The plot is somewhat irreverent, but it hits its comic targets reliably, in a way reminiscent of Chaplin's parody of Hitler, perhaps.Brooks' style of humor may not be for everyone, but this first attempt at direction is an enjoyable film. Look for Dick Shawn as a kooky, beat Hitler in the play within the movie.",7,1,2,21 February 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Some Old Friends And Some Old Stories
","Like a visit to an old friend, watching 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' fills one with nostalgia and provides a feeling of comfort. We have been here before, with the familiar plot lines and the usual environments. There's even a cantina scene.But they say familiarity breeds contempt, and it does seem that some viewers are finding this new Star Wars episode contemptible, due to its lack of originality. Still, the box office has been record-setting.Still, there's BB-8. A variation on R2D2, he rolls along with a comic robotic facility and an expressiveness in the movement of his two sections. More importantly, there is Rey--a lead character that is not significant for her gender, but for her likability and her strength. She is an outsider to the general conflict and the history of the saga. A non-warrior who finds her calling when BB-8 happens to cross her path.I can't imagine an Star Wars fan not wanting to see this chapter in the series, but I can understand why some might expect more. Even battle scenes seem like reboots from much earlier episodes. But if the cliffhanger finish leads to the story lines it suggests, I am happy to consider this film one half of a longer episode yet to finish.",7,1,16,24 June 2016
Flight," Can a man be both hero and criminal?
","Trailers might lead you to believe this is a film about flying. Or about an amazing flying feat. But it is all about the lead character, Captain 'Whip' Whitaker (Denzel Washington), a man who is a pilot and an alcoholic. The flying and a terrible crash provide background for the story of this man, who has struggled with his illness for years.In many ways the story is not that original. We have seen numerous stories about alcoholics and heard real-life testimonies of the behaviors that accompany alcoholism, and this film tracks with all of them.It is worth seeing for the brilliant portrayal of Captain Whitaker and the performances of the other actors in the film. Some parts are difficult to watch because the acting is so engaging.I also think the film raises some interesting questions that some viewers may not be willing to acknowledge. If one is an alcoholic, is the entire worth of that man nothing more than what his sickness drags him down to? Are we what we do? Can we rise above our neuroses or our worst behaviors? Often we see public figures condemned in media for indiscretions or harmful acts; is that, then, the measure of the man or woman?The film, even if judged solely for its dramatic content, is worth seeing.",8,33,38,4 September 2014
Rear Window," A Hitchcock Masterpiece
","L. B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is a professional photographer who travels the world in search of the next conflict or adventure. But he is spending most of his time in a wheelchair, in his apartment, while his leg heals--the result of a photo assignment involving racecars. Outside his windows is an array of neighbors living their lives in their own apartments. Confined as he is, 'Jeff' comes to view their activities as entertainment.He is visited regularly by Stella (Thelma Ritter), the insurance company nurse assigned to care for him. She administers massages and advice, telling Jeff he should ask his girlfriend, Lisa to marry him, and maybe he should spend less time spying on his neighbors, because she smells 'trouble'.But Jeff feels that he and Lisa (Grace Kelly) are too different from each other. She comes from the world of high fashion and refinement, whereas he lives his life (usually) on the go in danger and dirt. Besides wondering if he should break up with Lisa, Jeff's energies are directed mostly toward dealing with the summer heat and insufferable under-cast itching. But then he becomes caught up in the intrigue surrounding one neighbor. His own imagination runs wild, drawing him into the private drama outside his windows.This Hitchcock masterpiece spends some time wondering about the morality of spying on one's neighbors, but mostly it takes us deeper and deeper into Jeff's world and his suspicions about some curious comings and goings.Filmed from the point of view of Jeffries, 'Rear Window' is a masterful film, filled with character studies and Hitchcock's economy of storytelling. The set is one of the best ever created. The music is wonderful, both in setting mood and in helping to create the world of the apartment complex. The story starts out lazily, then progressively becomes more and more urgent, building to a tense climax. Hitchcock is the master of suspense and this film is one of his best.",10,1,3,21 March 2015
Pitch Perfect," Campus Cliché
","Anna Kendrick plays Beca, a supposedly edgy girl who is forced to attend college by her professor father. He's as cool as a film aimed at teens will allow him to be (see Harry Dean Stanton in 'Pretty in Pink'). More than anything, I think 'Pitch Perfect' wants to be a John Hughes film, but there are numerous similarities to other films (like the cheer films). Beca wants to be a producer of music, but she find herself a member of the Bellas, an all girl a cappella singing group dedicated to conservative dress and tame renditions. Beca plays the adventurous girl cliché we have seen in many other films. She is the welder who bring flashdance to the ballet world. She is the white girl who brings hip hop to the ballet world. She is Baby, bringing dirty dancing to the stodgy world of the middle-upper class vacation resort. What revelation does Beca bring to the glee world? The layering of songs. Earth-shaking.Beca has a rather uninspired romance with a guy who sings for another a cappella group, The Treblemakers. He, unlike her, is a movie fan and he recommends she watch 'The Breakfast Club' (by John Hughes). After finally watching the film, she suggests that the Bellas reveal secrets about themselves, but nothing is really revealed.There also is the clichéd fat girl, named Fat Amy (Rebel Wilson), who is sexually aggressive and loud--surprise!'Pitch Perfect' is a Glee-ful tribute whose best attributes are the music and the voices that sing the music. They make the film worth listening to. Also worth watching are Adam Devine as Bumper ('Modern Family) and Brittany Snow as Chloe. Too bad the script was not strong enough to support the other talented actors in the film.",7,0,2,18 May 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Catching Fire: The Bridge to another Episode
","Picking up where the first 'Hunger Games' film ended, 'Catching Fire' takes a while to develop. The action does not pick up until the actual game.This 'part 2' really feels like that's what it is. As a stand alone story, it is lacking, which is why I am downgrading it to a 6.When the warriors get to the battlefield, it really feels like a variation on the TV show 'Survivor'. Alliances are tenuous and changeable. Katniss' love also seems subject to change.But Jennifer Lawrence's acting is the highlight of the film. She really commits to the character and seems to lose herself in it.",6,0,7,6 February 2015
Kingsman: The Secret Service," A Fun Ride Through A Heroic World Of Action
","I purposely try not to know too much about a film before I watch it. This film starts out like a typical Bond film, but quickly dispels that notion. The viewer is alerted that this is a film where you can expect the unexpected. After a while, I recognized the comic book origins of the story and allowed myself to just enjoy the world of 'Kingsman', where style trumps substance.Meanwhile, the references to other films were flying left and right. Some of the more obvious to me (besides the Bond canon) were 'The Man from U.N.C.L.E.', 'V for Vendetta', 'Kill Bill', and even 'The Princess Bride.'One of the best things about this film is the photography. The camera is always moving. In fight scenes, it does not film from afar; it enters the fray and traces the flights of bullets, bottles and fists. It moves from scene to scene with a smoothness that is enjoyable, unlike some modern films that feel like they are edited to change camera views every split second.The film is violent. There are violent characters intent on mass destruction and intrepid heroes who do what is necessary to stop them. But still this is comic book violence, though some may not understand the difference.The heroes are 'gentlemen' agents--men of chivalry and refinement, like James Bond distilled to his essence and perfected over the years. I give this film high marks for its creativity, its style, the scenery and sets, and its action scenes. With tongue in cheek, it takes the viewer on a fun ride and sets the table for future sequels.",8,2,8,25 February 2015
Easy A," Fun, Especially If You Like John Hughes
","Easy A is based on Nathaniel Hawthorne's 'The Scarlet Letter', but is an homage to the teen films of John Hughes. Director Will Gluck even uses clips from some of those films.Emma Stone plays Olive, the Hester Prynne of Ojai North High School. She is blessed with a script that gives her character intelligence and insight, combined with a mastery of pop culture references. The result is an extremely funny lampoon of various institutions and social conventions.Though Olive is the victim of social mores and social media, this comedy keeps things light, thanks to the prodigious charm of Ms. Stone. I might have to watch this film repeatedly to pick up all the references to other films and memes.Among the other great performances is Patricia Clarkson's portrayal of Olive's mother. She lends a quirkiness that feels genuine and is not demeaning to an older generation.If John Hughes can't grace us with more of his films, this is a welcome addition to the genre.(This review is approved by Abe Froman. Never had one lesson!)",8,0,0,6 July 2020
Green Book," Great Story, Great Acting
","Though 'Green Book' has won a library-full of awards, many critics have been lukewarm about its merits. That is because they wish to see it as a commentary on race relations in the U.S. That is like viewing 'My Cousin Vinny' as a commentary on the American judicial system.The film, based on a true story, is about the dynamics of a relationship between two men from different stations and cultures. Tony (Viggo Mortensen) is a meatball hired to drive Dr. Shirley (Mahershala Ali), an erudite black man, on a concert tour that passes through the deep South. Written, in part, by the son of real-life Tony, it is a rewarding story of education and transformation that provides both laughter and tears.The pace of the film is perfect. The viewer feels like a third passenger in the car as it motors from venue to venue, state to state, while a charming battle of wills evolves. And 1962 is created so accurately---through props and locations, wardrobe and music---that you can practically smell the rooms they have staged.This is definitely one of the best films of 2018.",10,1,1,29 March 2020
Incredibles 2," A Visual Treat
","The original film was fun to watch, so I was anxiously anticipating this sequel. As expected, this is a superhero action film, but it falls into the comedy category because it constantly gives you reasons to chuckle.Due to its production values, this film had me noting several outstanding features, including:1. The sound. If viewed in a modern theater, you will hear some impressive and playful effects using sound and space.
2. The soundtrack. This is an orchestral treat!
3. Visual effects. Attention to detail is everywhere. Note the appearance and texture of hair, water, clothing, and the visual composition.
4. Enjoy the final credits with their charming art show.The storyline is not so unique and the portrayals of the characters are standard fare, but I could enjoy this film just for its craftsmanship.",8,1,2,4 September 2018
Saboteur," An Average Hitchcock Suspense Story
","This film is vintage Hitchcock. It contains many of his trademark attributes. But it can best be considered a precursor to his classic film 'North by Northwest'. Both contain these elements: a plot involving an innocent man on the run, a seemingly benevolent pillar of the community who is the villain, the scenic use of an American landmark, and even the use of an auction as a plot point.Robert Cummings plays Barry--the innocent man. Priscilla Lane plays Pat--the woman who becomes involved in his intrigue. Otto Kruger plays Tobin--the villain who menaces with a smile on his face. It's a solid cast, but Hitchcock himself was disappointed that he could not procure the services of the actors he preferred.This film is very much a product of its time, being released soon after the U.S. entered WWII. With the citizenry of the nation on alert and still in shock after the Pearl Harbor attack, the story of 'Saboteur' would seem to be on the mark, but it was a box office failure. Compare that to the performance of 'The Major and the Minor', a Billy Wilder comedy starring Ginger Rogers, which was also released in 1942. It was a hit, perhaps because it offered escapism to its audiences.The film is a vehicle for wartime pontificating, including speeches about democracy versus totalitarianism--speeches that were stiff like the slogans on patriotic posters. Hitchcock makes the best of it, but the film lacks the charm of 'North by Northwest', which also features the charms of Cary Grant.Hitchcock is masterful in using the element of suspense, particularly the passage of time. But many of his later efforts show his perfection of all cinematic elements, including suspense.",7,0,0,5 March 2017
Spectre," Daniel Craig Bows Out In Bond's Most Beautiful Film
","Daniel Craig has proclaimed that this will be his last Bond film. The demands of keeping in shape are central to his decision. Well, I am happy to say that his last is a great piece of film. If you have seen all the negative reviews for this film, which say that it's too boring or they don't like the storyline or even that the title song is inappropriate, you might be wondering how I can celebrate 'Spectre'. Let me elucidate.First of all, the story begins in Mexico City during the Day of the Dead celebration, which I am sure some Bond fans will see as a reference to 'Live and Let Die'. There is a seemingly continuous (though it's not, which makes it masterful) tracking shot that is fun to watch as Bond prepares to launch into his mission. There is the collapsing building scene that has been shown in trailers. Then there is a fight scene in a helicopter that is doing amazing stunts.The fairly traditional credits are accompanied by a nice song by Sam Smith. I am clueless why anyone would not like the song in this context.The best surprise of all is the cinematography. 'Spectre' is one of the most beautifully shot films ever. No matter the time of day or the setting, the lighting is the star of this film--at twilight, in fog, in dark interiors. The camera frames the scenes with an unerring eye for capturing beautiful images. The storyline is no more convoluted than is typical in a Bond film. It starts with a mystery and run parallel to another story about the globalization of security, with the attendant subtexts of 'progress' outdating traditional methods, and the larger dangers that arise from more powerful systems.This Bond is caring, not callous. He still indulges in the occasional quip, but he keeps his eyes on the prize with a pragmatic focus. He may be a little tired/sad--having seen the dismantling of the organization he dedicated his life to--but he still has more than enough energy to battle hand to hand with the badasses and to devise strategies on the fly and engage in the usual breathless chases.This Bond film has the longest running time. Thankfully, it allows the viewer to really enjoy its beauty. What a shame so many have not appreciated it.",9,1,4,21 February 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," A Visually Stunning Film, A Thrill Ride
","Remarkable for its stunning visuals, 'Fury Road' is part of the Mad Max canon that started with Mel Gibson. Tom Hardy plays Max in this film, but his role is overshadowed by Charlize Theron's performance as Imperator Furiosa, a driver for a tribal warlord. She goes rogue, stealing his property and dashing through the desert, hoping to find freedom and sanctuary.This is an action film that is nearly nonstop action. The story has twists that prolong the suspense so the chase never becomes boring.With stylistic references to 'Snowpiercer', 'Star Wars', 'Dune', 'Star Wars' and gladiator films, 'Fury Road' is basically a retooling of the classic western. Imagine the wagon train speeding for safety while being chased by the Indian war party.The dystopian setting for the film is a brutal world where those who control the resources have all the power. Theron does a great job of portraying the tough warrior who can survive in such a world. Her physicality is totally believable and the product of months of training (undoubtedly aided by her dance training).Hardy provides a strong performance, but the script, especially in the beginning, inhibits his ability to express himself. The mythology of this film is pervasive and convincing. The settings, costuming, and the design elements, combined with a dramatic and impressive soundtrack, make 'Fury Road' a beautifully choreographed dance of death. The editing is tremendous, deserving of the Oscar (one of six awarded to this film).",9,2,6,11 July 2017
The Breakfast Club," A Teen Classic By John Hughes
","It has been opined that 'The Breakfast Club' is the best of John Hughes' teen flicks. The others---'Sixteen Candles', 'Pretty in Pink', 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off', and 'Some Kind of Wonderful'---deal with similar themes, but they follow more conventional story arcs.In 'The Breakfast Club' five students spend eight hours together in the high school library for an all-day detention. On Saturday. During that time, they are forced, by proximity, to interact and to better understand each other.When they first enter the library, they are strangers. Though they attend the same school, they are separated by cliques and class. Hughes uses various methods in his wonderful script to make them or allow them to see beyond the boundaries of peer pressure and group conformity.When we first meet them, we think we know them, based upon outward appearances and our own personal experiences. When I attended high school, there was a girl who was athletic, attractive and who always had a smile on her face. She was a cheerleader, which contributed to her popularity. Years after high school, I had the opportunity to get to know her personally and I discovered that she had a home life that was far from idyllic, it not dysfunctional. She dealt with stresses that belied her confident, seemingly happy, behavior.In this film, director and writer Hughes shows us the realities behind the facades. He uses a number of techniques in the process. First, the students are united in their opposition to the adult authority figure that is Mr. Vernon (Paul Gleason), who is charged with maintaining order. He is an obnoxious martinet, so it is easy for the kids to form a bond through their dislike of him. Eventually, they become complicit in defying his authority.The main way Hughes moves the story, creates tension, and reveals (and bonds) the students is through the character of John Bender (Judd Nelson), the sarcastic, anti-establishment rebel who likes to shock. Seemingly, he brings no lunch for the day. Nelson handles this central role with aplomb. Surprisingly, we find that he is probably the most intelligent person in the group. In later life he might become an artist, always offering a critical eye, challenging conventions. But for now he exhorts raw emotions and pushes the exposition of the story. At one point, he sacrifices himself for the group, further bonding them.Other methods used in the script to bond the five are one-on-one conversations, whistling in unison, music and dance (used as catharsis), smoking marijuana, exploring the contents of purses and wallets, and, eventually, group conversations.Claire (Molly Ringwald) is the well-connected social butterfly. She is popular and virginal. She brings sushi for lunch in a bento box.Andrew (Emilio Estevez) is the jock. Like a white knight, he is a winner who stands up for principles. He and Claire can socialize, because they dwell in the upper strata of school society. He's a wrestler, and his large lunch is an abundance of caloriesAllison (Ally Sheedy) is the most mysterious of the group. An anti-social loner who rarely speaks, she seems to exist in her own inner world. Her lunch is obviously self-made, consisting of a sugar sandwich she constructs from Pixy Stix and Cap'n Crunch.Brian (Michael Anthony Hall) is the nerd, the straight A student, the college-bound square with no game. He has a fake ID so he can vote. For lunch, he has a thermos of soup, a PB&J sandwich and apple juice.We also meet Carl, the custodian, who upsets expectations by demonstrating that he is observant, philosophical, and capable of social commentary. He says he is the 'eyes and ears of this institution.'As the hours go by, we learn that Bender has an abusive home life, Claire has parents who don't care about her or each other, Andrew is bullied by his father to achieve athletic goals, and Brian brought a gun to school due to academic pressures. Most pathetic of all, Allison is spending her Saturday in detention because she had nothing better to do. She is also a compulsive liar and a kleptomaniac.Each of the students, like all adolescents, is struggling for self-identification. And an understanding of sexual roles and mores. And how to deal with the pressures of conformity. In the end, they realize that peer pressure will continue to affect them when they return to school on Monday. But they wonder will their new-found friendships continue.One of the best scenes is when Allison, transformed by a makeover from Claire, presents herself without her face being covered by her untamed hair, and becomes vulnerable. Though she is fearful of their responses to her new face, she is hopeful. On Monday, will she remain that way?There is never a group hug, but bonds are formed and we see, in various ways, that promises are made. We are left wondering what the new week will bring for the five who found that 'We're all pretty bizarre. Some of us are just better at hiding it.'Hughes weaves a complex tale of discovery that rings true and will not go out of fashion for a long time.",10,0,0,13 May 2019
The Great Gatsby," The next-to-best Gatsby
","First, I want to say that I did not see the 3D version of this movie, so my review is only for the 2D version.I read the book years ago. I saw the 1974 movie the year it came out. I am a fan of both. But I am also a fan of Baz Luhrman. One could tell this new movie was a Baz Luhrman product within 3 seconds. And the remainder of the film has his signature all over it. Even though I might criticize this 2013 version, I want to say that I liked it.I preferred the music in the 1974 version, but I did not find the modern music of this version annoying at all. The 1974 film was slightly more faithful to the book--which is a good thing--but this version was fairly faithful. The main difference was the invention of a back story concerning Nick's health. I found it distracting and, more importantly, an invalidation of Nick's reliability as narrator (and our guide to the world of Gatsby and environs).I also preferred the actors in the 1974 version. Redford is more reserved--a man in control, a man of mystery who does not wear his heart on his sleeve. Mia Farrow's Daisy was much more fleshed out and more believable, not to mention a sadder victim of her society. In similar ways, I preferred all of the acting choices from 1974.Some have called The Great Gatsby a love story. From Gatsby's point of view, that is true. But from the reader's point of view, TGG is a mystery. As we read the book, we are trying to understand the man, and solve the mysteries of his past. As others have said, the quick cuts that drive the narrative of the 2013 version are annoying and, worse yet, impair the viewer's ability to immerse himself in the lavish richness of the visuals. One reviewer said she really enjoyed the 'beautiful shirts' scene in the 2013 version. For me there was no comparison. I would use that scene as an example of where the 1974 film was much superior. When Redford tosses the shirts, the viewer feels he is in a rich, colorful, extravagant shower. And Farrow's Daisy is positively overcome by the experience.In closing, I recommend this film, but I recommend that viewers first read the book and see the 1974 Gatsby. May you be lured to West Egg as surely as the jazz-age celebrants were drawn to the flame of Gatsby's determination.",7,2,5,2 June 2013
The Proposal," A Lightweight But Enjoyable Romcom
","Sometimes people say 'Hollywood doesn't make films like that anymore', referring to the situational boy-meets-girl romances of the 30s or 40s. Well, it does and this is one example, though this is boy-works-for-girl who is a tyrant as a boss. When you go to this movie, you know it's a romance, and so the 'suspense', if you will, is how can the writers get the star-crossed characters together?Sandra Bullock plays Margaret Tate, the boss everyone fears and hates. She has no personal life and no family life. Ryan Reynolds is her underling, Andrew Paxton. The story thrusts them into spending time outside of work together. Family members--including Betty White as Andrew's 'Gammy'--help to put the com in romcom.The disdain of Margaret and Andrew for each other appears to be an insurmountable obstacle to love. Before the film ends though, vows are take--but not the kind you expect. Still, such films are about affirming the power of love and this film will not disappoint.",7,0,0,11 December 2016
The Wizard of Oz," A Great and Powerful Film
","Released in 1939, 'The Wizard of Oz' is a classic American film that had a modest start. After its release, and for many years, it was viewed as an entertaining film but not as a great film. When I was a child, it aired on network TV once a year, around Thanksgiving. Whole families would gather around their sets for this special annual viewing.Later, when films became more widely available, its reputation seemed to grow and one would find it included in the lists of 'best' films. Personally, I have always loved 'The Wizard of Oz'. I have seen it so many times, I practically know it frame by frame, as I am sure many others do.Here are some of the reasons this film should be considered great and powerful:1. The Beginning: The first part of the film, which is filmed in rich sepia tones, includes comedy, suspense, drama, music, and the establishment of all main characters.2. The tornado: The special effects used to create the menacing tornado are spectacular. It is still an emotionally charged element, despite our exposure to the spectacles of modern CGI.3. The song: 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' is regarded as one of the best film songs of all time. The film almost starred Shirley Temple and MGM wanted to cut the song, so we should consider ourselves lucky.4. Judy Garland: The use of Judy Garland to play the role of Dorothy Gale added a sense of maturity to the role and to the movie in general. Her vocal talents elevated the film.5. Frank Morgan: First introduced in the film as Professor Marvel, Frank Morgan's talents are used in a clever way through his various characters.6. The use of color: When Dorothy arrives in Munchkinland, the screen erupts in color. It has various symbolic uses, but mostly it delineates between the world Dorothy is from and a new world where the rules are unknown.7. The Munchkins: The strangeness of the new world and a considerable amount of charm are enhanced by this troupe and their voices.8. The Yellow Brick Road: Not the literal road, but what it represents--an adventure of possibilities, where heroes are tested.9. Serendipity: The fortunate way the elements of this film came together (Judy Garland vs. Shirley Temple, Ray Bolger vs. Buddy Ebsen, the use of the 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow', etc.)10. The Wizard: The use of screen projection, smoke and sound produced a scary Wizard that contrasted sharply with the beneficent image suggested to Dorothy by Glinda and the Munchkins.11. The musical score in general. The production is generously endowed with some magical musical numbers.12. The supporting cast: Dorothy's fellow travelers seem perfectly cast to us now, so iconic are their characterizations.13. The Witch: One of the great villains in film history, surrounded by her henchmen and her minions (the flying monkeys, terrors in their own right).14. The script: The story is engaging. It is also responsible for a slew of iconic quotes. My favorite is 'Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain!'15. The director: Victor Fleming's vision produced a delightful film that can be enjoyed over and over. When we consider that he also is credited with directing 'Gone with the Wind' in the same year--amazing!",10,4,5,1 June 2014
The Martian," Stranded On Mars
","When a dangerous windstorm threatens, the crew of the Ares 3 mission must quickly abort and leave the surface of Mars. They mistakenly leave behind Mark Watney (Matt Damon), who decides to find a way to survive in the harsh environment with inadequate supplies. Watney is a botanist who uses his problem solving and resource management talents to their best advantage.Meanwhile, people back on Earth are celebrating Watney's sacrifice with a large memorial and plenty of hoopla. Matt Damon gets most of the screen time of 'The Martian'. As in other castaway stories, his experience is the focus of the film. Viewers can identify with his everyman qualities and project themselves into his situation, making the film a one-man adventure. As someone who prefers first-person video games, I found this to be very relatable and enjoyable.Though there are a few (notable) errors of science, this is good science fiction. It also includes enough humor to keep the mood somewhat light.One running gag is that Watney dislikes disco music, but it's the only music available to him on Mars (after he rifles through the belongings of his fellow crew members). As a viewer, I began to share his opinion by the end of the film, but only because the recordings were all of the pop-disco style (e.g. Gloria Gaynor, Miami Sound Machine), which rely more on their lyrics than the pounding, driving beat that is the hallmark of truly inspiring swing dance disco. It's a distinction few viewers will key on. Instead, focus on the enchanting story and you will survive.",8,1,1,10 April 2016
