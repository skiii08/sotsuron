Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Over-elaboration on the Motif of Physical Cruelty
","SpoilersThere the heroine is, scene after scene, bloodied, covered in clots and forming scabs, blotched with lesions, bulging with contusions, all lathered in sweat, shaking and panting in agony and exhaustion. (In flashbacks to her time with Pei Mai, bloodless and character-rounding for the most part, she is tormented by him with an arm lock that has her screaming and begging, snot and saliva dripping in a long strand to the ground as she writhes miserably in close up.) She is buried alive and left for dead, apparently past all hope, and we have a ringside seat for the whole ghastly misogynistic thing, complete with blithe and bonny crosscutting to every stray event taking place within a 5000 mile or 10 year radius. Read that: Her suffering is ridiculously, obscenely studied, protracted and severe.Is it significant, I wonder, that both 'volumes' of this film begin with a close up of the main female character's swollen and gashed face, her bloodied head being shot point blank with a large caliber handgun as she begs for life? --As if once wasn't enough. What's that all about? What does it say that this stuff goes down so well with the audience? For sure, it goes light years beyond just establishing firm character motivation. It seems clear that somebody thrills at the sight of this pretty lady being put into a world of hurt. --And in this, the audience is every bit as implicated as the artist. Hide behind claims that it is parody or comedy, if you will, or just a hip exercise in pastiche style. But what is lacking in this film is humanity, nothing less than decency. It is truly pornographic. Many people have charged the same of The Passion for indulging with reverence and horror in the same kind of over-elaborated physical suffering this film does apparently for kicks.I concede that my failure to stomach this film in the spirit in which it is supposed to be offered can be construed as totally not hip and not tough. Well, guilty as charged. Some people will claim that life, with its careening, out-of-control random violence, has escalated from horror to absurdity to comedy in the last several decades. There is only one problem with that point of view: Comedy or no, none of us has the room to laugh. --And that's exactly what Kill Bill 1 and 2 encourages us to do.Zero stars. Bill 2 is a technically competent film. But as nearly all major films these days can make the same claim, that is not a recommendation for it. In the all-important areas outside the merely technical-- namely the moral and thematic -- Bill 2 is 1) reprehensible and 2) a mess. It's nothing more than cool (that's debatable) and conscienceless trash.",Null,2,3,24 April 2004
Mission: Impossible III," Child of Raiders
","I have to hand it to MI3: It delivers nonstop action and the kind of over-hyped 'intense' moments of which Hollywood builds prefab popcorn movies with sleep-walking regularity. I find no plot holes to carp about. In fact, the film is to be commended for not letting anything so burdensome as a plot get in its way. Almost every second of screen time is given to explosions and athletic stunts and sweaty last second cliffhanging saves that tax physics and credulity to the tensile snapping point. This sort of film is the logical conclusion of a development in film-making begun with Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1980. If you recall that film from the time of its release, you know exactly what I mean. It was next generation Hitchcock that built a celluloid shrine to one single object, the all stops pulled set piece. That single object had but one purpose, for these fan boy plunderers of the Hitchcock legacy: To stagger you under the one-two gut-punch of crazy plot revelation AND slick bit of film-making, the FX or and the way a scene was shot and assembled. Raiders and its legion of imitators took the Statue of Liberty scene from Saboteur, the Mt Rushmore scene from North by Northwest and the Merry Go Round scene from Strangers on a Train as their inspiration and rolled one of these magical film instants out every 7 minutes of screen time. Inflation being what it is, the time between big moments has narrowed to more like every 2 minutes. And the actions which seemed far fetched in Raiders -- Indi being dragged top- speed under a truck down a gravel road, the face off in the pit of a thousand million snakes, the final blowout confrontation between supernatural forces and the bad guys -- are tamed by comparison with the downright giddy visual hyperbole by the time we get to the MI franchise. I don't exactly regret that Raiders ever happened; it was a rousing, loving, and perhaps above all, a history-savvy homage to a certain type of film moment. But what has happened to Hollywood since then is hard not to view with regret. Still, it's not Spielberg's fault that his palatable take on Hitchcock's deft touches has evolved from slightly overwrought parody to witless and ham-handed overkill.The story is-- let's be generous -- strikingly simple: The bad guy who wants the Mcguffin back gets to Cruise's squeeze and, holding her captive, is able to make him dance -- which in this case means make him deliver the Mcguffin back home. How all this happens, in terms of filmed language and gestalt, makes the cartoon caffeine cinema of Michael Bay look like the glacial floe of Robert Bresson's oeuvre. If I have seen more shaking camera, strobing light and one second edits, I'm not sure where.Maybe because I searched for something as old school as the faint must of 'literary quality' to the script (silly me), my favorite MI3 bit is what you could call a storytelling conceit. It isn't original. It's the Citizen Kane gambit of beginning with the end, flashing back, and progressing to the same point by film's end. They put a surprise twist to this gambit, but that isn't really very original either (sort of like the old TV series or Wild Wild West). So, um, forget the search for literary quality here. I give the film 5 stars of 10.",Null,3,5,16 July 2006
The Ring," Among recent horror films, subtle and genuinely creepy
","Spoilers.This film does small things splendidly, and gets major points for eschewing huge film FX overkill that has plagued supernatural cinema from the '90s on. The makers of The Ring should be on the lookout for a parcel of all our unused Starbuck's coupons for crafting a film that appeals to the devotee of the Last House on the Left and the original Cat People alike. In fact, The Ring feels like a summit, as if M. Knight Shamalyan (Mr. Sensitive) met David Cronenburg (Mr. Gutwrench), and the two agreed to split the telling of a good ghost story 70/30 to appeal to the broadest possible audience.
The Ring is, at its very best, a film of rich yet understated, indeed Lewtonesque moments. When the heroine picks a fly off the TV screen, after viewing the video several times and having seen clearly up to that point that the fly is a part of the recorded video image, her nose begins simultaneously to bleed. It is simple as can be, but a moment of supreme unease. And just after passing under a ladder propped against a wall on a downtown street, something clicks in the heroine's brain. De javu. She wheels about and places it as the exact ladder and wall setup from The Bad Video. The film is full of slight unsettling moments, such as these, that intelligently portend things dark, deep and grave as the heroine realizes her life and The Bad Video are beginning to intertwine.
The part I have mixed feelings about: Inevitably the format of the film merges into an investigative procedural. They simply had to make some gesture of explaining 'Why?', I suppose. Well, I wasn't going to ask, and they didn't have to go there. She is an angry spirit, sure, a thwarted soul. Leave it at that. But, no, once we start being asked to ask, we want to know their theory on it at least. How is she different from any other angry spirit? Her father says, significantly, she wasn't supposed to have been born. This is left hang. The film creates a killer atmosphere of wonder, out of not letting us know. We are inundated by enough genuinely creepy stuff we don't stop to wonder about backstory. But once the film assumes the level of a detective story, that now very familiar X Files/CSI guys-with-flashlights plane, we may begin to feel that we are waiting for a very important message. Ultimately, I think their explanation is disappointing. The horror in this film is in our feeling during the trip, not our arrival at any particular destination.The Ring is a welcome step out of the routine of crap like 13 Ghosts and the remake of The Haunting, films that give much sound and fury signifying nothing  -- so beloved by generations of horror film fans -- a rotten name. I recommend The Ring with only small-quibble reservations. Seen in a year or two, totally clear of the hype, I think it will be more clearly seen as one of the best horror films in a while. Right now, the aftertaste of the films promotion and well-intentioned but blathersome audience buzz dilutes the purity of this delightfully creepy dark ride/deer-in-the-headlights experience.9 of 10 stars.",Null,1,1,23 July 2003
Alien," One of the two great horrors, ever
","On subsequent viewings, I can be clinical, so I'll have to admit it doesn't scare me at all anymore. But when I saw it first day of release in the theaters, Ridley Scott's ALIEN was the scariest thing I had ever seen up to that point and long after. The mounting of atmosphere was the thing: By the point, about 20 minutes in, that Hurt, Skerrit and Weaver descend to that intestinal-looking ship, anyone seeing the film for the first time in 1979 felt so uneasy they wanted to leave, literally just get up, go shopping or driving, call a friend, and forget this unsettling film entirely. I have talked to other people who had the very same reaction. We were so scared, we actually thought our choice to see the movie had been a mistake --specifically, because the sense of foreboding was so thick.It's hard for me to explain that reaction, not feeling exactly the same way about it any more. But I can see clearly, still, even after much of its impact has worn off on me, that it did something exceedingly well that most films these days fail at miserably: it created a sense of extreme dread and unease by the slow incremental building of atmosphere, block by block, without resort to a lot of juicy/gory violence. It accomplished this by the natural evolution of events and subtle revelation of terrain. The Ring did that exceptionally well, too, as did Carpenter's The Thing.There is little more violence in ALIEN than in Hitchcock's PSYCHO from 20 years before. Like PSYCHO, ALIEN is an elegantly spare, judicious and intelligent attempt to scare the hell out of you. These films were made by really smart artists who realized that the geysers of gore their imitators latched on to as a major influence, and multiplied to the point of comedy in their films, are ultimately reductive. They force us to retreat into a cool appreciation of the FX and the scope of spectacle, and nothing more. The scares of PSYCHO and ALIEN are primal. Their feeling, distinct from the FX, taps the makers' deepest dread, and ours.Ten stars. Approached in the right spirit, setting aside all the reams of films ALIEN inspired, it might still pack a wallop. It's hard for me to tell at this point. But it will always be, with PSYCHO, one of the two scariest films of my life.",Null,0,1,7 February 2004
American Psycho," Stinging satire if you know how to take it
","Spoiler alert.In my favorite scene in the film, the main character-- whom we will call Reagan-Boy-- has a guest sitting on his couch, calmly sipping wine and listening to Reagan-Boy pontificate in fine, pointless MBA babble-speak about the intricacies of his favorite Huey Lewis album. All the while the guest nods and politely uh-huhs, perhaps thinking the weighty discourse on the mundane topic incongruous, but still not taking enough of a hint, as Reagan-Boy puts on a plastic rain-coat and fetches a fire ax to slaughter his guest. Why does Reagan-Boy act this way? Is it to vent his monumental rage that he isn't a genius? --That the depth of a man who obsesses over the embossing of his business cards will never be recognized by those pesky insects called 'fellow human beings'? --Because he is on a lifelong streak and can seemingly do whatever his dark heart desires without consequence? This last, I think. The 80s were a time when immoral action not only seemed to go unpunished, but was resoundingly rewarded with power position and political office; Reagan-Boy's situation speaks directly to that aspect of the decade.As a satire of the time and of a certain generation, this film succeeds on the level of They Live. I give it 8 stars. It doesn't belong on anyone's Best Horror Film List, but on their best Satire List, probably.",Null,0,0,19 September 2001
Apocalypse Now," Problems with the ending (Mainly)
","Contains spoilers. The problems I see with the film now: First, Dennis Hopper. At some point Hopper transcended (?) Actor and became a sort of floating Saturday Night Live celebrity guest host for life. --No matter where he is or what he is doing, that is what he is. His characters are never credible, and even more than in the case of Brando, whose celebrity is a monumental thing to sublimate as you watch him, you never for an instant forget you are watching an Actor. Worse than his simple inability to fit into a scenario where verisimilitude is important, though, is the fact that he threatens to undermine the seriousness and horror of this film, by reminding one of the incessantly gibbering, fluttering Disney feature length cartoon comic relief (think of the china ware in Beauty and the Beast). If, along with the reinsertion of formerly edited footage, they could have reduced Hopper's hammy drive-in movie level role (think of Waterworld), they should have. His appearance so close to the end of the film, problematic as that ending already is, is especially damaging. Second, one is loath to say a clearer or more decisive ending would have been welcome or done the film a world of good. Yet after three hours of the most grueling verisimilitude, three hours in which you accept every surreal, absurd, horrific sight laid before you as Gospel truth, an ending that may act as a reality disconnect is a problem indeed. At the time of the 20th anniversary revival of Apocalypse Now, a friend of mine said 'It is a great film, but there is no way I can accept that the ending would have happened the way it does in the film in real life.' Not having seen the film at that point, I marked this off as a philistine gripe. It sounded like the complaint of someone disappointed that the ending wasn't a standard action film call-in-the-air-strike fireworks show. Now, just after having seen it, my friend's comment comes back to nag me. I am forced to concede it is entirely possible that the films agonizingly scrupulous mounting of tone and purpose, one of the most stunning in all film, is damaged by an ending that may make the viewer balk, or at least question its verisimilitude. The end falters by removing us from the most horrifically concrete reality ever put on film --being stuck way up river in the middle of Vietnam during the war; could there be anything worse in the human imagination?-- and offering in place of the reality an arty, impressionistic, cop-out ending that puts a handy Subjectivist toggle switch on Reality/ Perception. Because of this, there is a painted-into-a-corner feeling to the ending, a feeling that an invitation to the audience to fill in the blank has been offered by an artist afraid or unable to complete his statement. The rigorously-wrought horror is dissipated. Understand, I don't enjoy complaining about this major film achievement. There was no other director in the world at the time-- or maybe even now-- who could have made this film. But the ending is just such an incredible letdown. And there is no way a weak ending can erase the gripping power and brilliance of the three hours before it. But if anything, it leaves this film a special dispensation case. As it stands, Apocalypse Now belongs in the company of Erich Von Stroheim's Queen Kelli or Welles' The Magnificent Ambersons-- films that stand as classics despite weak or unsatisfactory resolutions resulting from third-party intervention. Maybe health problems, the strain of crippling financial worries, over-taxed energy levels and the weight on the filmmakers' conscience of Viet Nam itself intervened here, preventing Coppola and company from achieving a wrap up wholly commensurate with the astounding body of this film. Or maybe they simply couldn't bear to put a period at the end of the sentence.Whatever the case, what remains is a complicated, genius film, far beyond the scope of a simple star rating system. (But be warned of animal slaughter scenes, by the way, that Coppola could only have gotten away with filming offshore. If this sort of thing disturbs you, maybe you should pass on the film altogether, because acts of apparently genuine animal slaughter unfortunately have been made integral to the layered ending.)",Null,1,1,15 October 2001
Pearl Harbor," More Real Than Reel, For Much Of Its Length
","I will always resent what Top Gun did to action movies. You know it by heart: two buddies in the cockpits of state of the art aircraft, making like Thunderbirds, daring do, do or die. What hogwash.There is some of this --okay, too much of this -- in Pearl Harbor, but the good news is, this is mainly a simple she-has-to-choose love story set against the huge backdrop of history. Many people hold this against it. They say 'With one of the pivotal events of the century taking place, the makers act as if this dumb little story of 3 people matters. It doesn't; it's trivial!' Au contraire, my callow young friends. Real Life, versus Reel Life, is made up of the small things. We experience life in macro, while we study it through history in sweeping panorama. To the people living in that time, Pearl Harbor changed their lives, sure, as it does the three main characters here. But the other things they were engaged in continued right along. --The passions, the human folly. Why do people have such a hard time with this movie, and its concessions to this particular level of reality? It is in fact no more or less 'real' than many Hollywood films. --It is more real than most. Sure the Top Gun bit is hokey, but the love story, which is where the movie is rooted, rings true, even if a bit familiar.This movie may tell the story your grandmother or father would never tell you about what they were doing when the planes came. I give it 7 stars.",Null,0,0,20 September 2001
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Doesn't satisfy
","This film has been called a 90 minute thrill ride by some of the cast members. Fair enough. I think that's the best thing to be said about the film. But, unfortunately, it's also the films most damning liability. Sure-fire, wowing 'em story conference vortices spin up every 90 seconds and nothing ever really slows down enough for the audience to savor pieces of time. Tons of good stuff is tossed off as a waste. (Example: The medieval tapestries in Doctor Doom's castle are glimpsed for about two seconds, briefly picked out of Stygian dark by a restless camera. Works for a music video. Not so sure about here. I thought of what a genius producer like Val Lewton could have done to get that kind of detail on the screen, further probing a conspicuous and memorable prop as a metaphorical or sub-textual comment on a character. Here, it's just 'hey, look, we had a big budget'. But we can't dawdle. They want to get straight on to the blowout special effects.) The approach might be called Ginzu Bar & Grill film making. You are impressed by the flash. Undeniably a lot of dazzle is on show here. But it works up an appetite for a main course that ultimately proves to be more steam and sizzle than steak. As a film-goer, I was left wanting to take the proverbial cruise by White Castle for a sack of the real stuff on the way home from this polite but inadequate repast.Some things I miss: Galactus -- who very well might have seemed silly as a mile-tall guy with purple tights and a pronged hat -- is shown here as a fractal cloud of dust. I wish they could have found a way to handle 'him' without turning Galactus into an 'it'. When we glimpse him, he bears a striking resemblance to a front on a Doppler weather map. Maybe the Kirby Galactus wouldn't play today. But these guys are the big shot imagineers. Why couldn't they come up with anything better than this?More than this, however, I miss the full story of Silver Surfer, and I think the absence of that story does untold damage to this movie. As portrayed in the second FF, the Surfer is not exactly enigmatic, although that may have been the intention. Instead, he's underdeveloped, a nodding, gazing statue who -- because we don't know enough of his story, or feel enough of what he has at stake -- does not stir sufficient fear or curiosity or passion, as he should. One looks at where the story time went that could have been spent on this critical material. And one is left assuming it all went to watching Johnny Storm be cute. Or Reed and Sue's wedding take cute turns south. Or Ben Grimm being crude and gruff... and cute.It's a movie with cute to spare. There is no big concept comedy here. It's pretty much all 'character-based' comedy, which for these writers means sit-com comedy, sarcastic digs at each others foibles every other line. And the really dark places FF 2 could have gone -- Galactus' emotional blackmail of the Surfer -- are replaced by wise-acre comedy and depressingly convincing replications of red carpet tabloid TV. Did we really need to see all that?I can't help but feel FF 2 is an opportunity missed.",Null,11,23,17 June 2007
The Godfather: Part III," Exquisite Coppola
","It is in Coppola that I think we see the direction and spin Welles put on American cinema in it's most vivid survival. The multi-layering, the richness of texture. What Welles says about his films could go for Coppola's too. When someone called Welles' films 'baroque', he explained that for him when the texture of film becomes too thin, it becomes dead. Coppola must feel this way too. And when the still moments occur in Coppola, and there are many treasurable moments of stillness and reflection, there is still much going on in the frame, much to watch, subtexts and contexts to let wash over you. In other words, stillness, but not emptiness.I think they are all wrong about Sofia Coppola's part in this. If she had played her character in a higher key, a more 'real life' key, she would have been written off as a stridently irritating valley girl. She plays a self-conscious young woman in development somewhere between awkward wall-flower and blossoming social butterfly, and she plays it to a T, I believe. Low key. Why not? I guarantee you, three hours of anything else would have been too much. Her performance may have come out of talks with the director, or it may have been her good-sense intuitive playing. But whichever, I think the word 'shrewd' can be applied accurately to the way she acts and is used here.I prefer this third installment to the second, by the way. The third film achieves and sustains an overwhelming crescendo and haunting coda for the series. Taken as a unit, these 3 films form one of the stunning achievements of the American cinema. 10 stars for each Godfather film, this one no exception.",Null,11,22,19 September 2005
Jackie Brown," Perhaps the most shocking entry in the Tarantino canon
","Quent loves to play, and you can pretty much count the Kill Bills and Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs -- the director's entire oeuvre-- as the work of an oldish boy swinging self-consciously twixt the pits and pinnacles of as gaudy and embarrassing a public arrested adolescence as Hollywood has seen.JB, on the other hand, is all the things the rest are not: subtle and sublimely emotionally resonant, an astoundingly adult work, drawn with feelings such as regret (in place of adolescent phobias), reluctant resignation (in place of retreat before a whooping menace with a straight razor), and compromise (in place of 'throw the gun out or we'll blast you' play-acting that alone seems to inform Quent's imagination). QT amazes us this time out with the maturity of his vision. We didn't know he had it in him. That simple.There are many of us who wish the fan boy favorite would quit playing for the fan boys, and get down to the business of creating great films for the rest of the planet. Jackie Brown made us impatient for the inevitability of this development, and keeps the hope that it may some day happen alive for us. Just don't wait too long, Quent.Ten of ten.
