Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," there is no spoon (including spoilers)
","If you quieten your mind you can hear your minichlorines chanting 'oh what a terrible movie', if you focus really hard you can see that there actually was no movie - there certainly was no plot or dialog.I don't want to write about this movie, instead I want to tell you all about an art exhibition that a went to in '94 - the entry fee was about the same as the price of a movie ticket. One installation was a tree that fell over and was hydraulically lifted up again and again and again. Another room was filled with 3000 pink things from combs to vacuum cleaners. Yet another room contained a washing machine filled with human excrement and semen. I walked out after half an hour.think about this for a momentArt. Not art. Who is to say? Art constantly breaks boundaries which it just a moment ago established, it is unimportant whether it's good or bad.;think about this for a momentEntertainment. The money tells you whether it's good or bad. Or does it? Is the 'menace' anything else but aptly named? Since when is a movie without a plot, without dialog (only one epic slogan after another good for little else than a cool trailer), no characters and bad animations considered good entertainment?This movie is nothing but a worldwide installation of art, showing how a not-movie is a great movie, this is Zen or homeopathy. I am sad to say that the aforementioned washing machine was a more meaningful piece of art then this movie.Now I will forget about this movie.",Null,1,2,20 August 1999
