The Blair Witch Project," This does to camping what JAWS did for swimming.
","1999 is quite a remarkable year for the cinema.  With the comedy genre coming back strong with the brilliant ANALYZE THIS, now the horror genre is back in it's most chilling form with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT.  It seemed like that the horror genre was going downhill with such recent horror films as 'I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER,' 'URBAN LEGEND,' 'BRIDE OF CHUCKY,' 'WISHMASTER,' and the idiotic and trendy 'SCREAM' movies.  The only recent films that were considered good horror films were 'EVENT HORIZON' and 'JOHN CARPENTER'S VAMPIRES.'  Now,  just like 1978 with John Carpenter's 'HALLOWEEN' the terror in films is brought back to a new figure.  And sad to say, years from now, everybody is going to be copying this film. THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT is about three young student film-makers who go to the small town in Maryland formerly called 'Blair.'  In this town they wish to uncover the mystery about the Blair Witch legend.  With interviews with the town locals, they tell stories that range from typical bedtime stories to urban legends.  Then the students wish to go out a seek this mysterous 'graveyard' where some of these burials occur.  As they go out into the woods looking for this graveyard, they begin to get deeper and deeper into a horrible and scary world that they never knew that they would be getting into. This is what I call a SCARY movie.  It makes SCREAM and SCREAM 2 look like a Disney movie.  What makes it scary?  We can all relate to what these filmmakers are going through.  1.) Being lost:  we all get lost, and when we get lost, we get paranoid, confused, and scared.  These people getting lost in the woods can only cause them to not concentrate as much as they should. 2.) The scary noises in the dark:  when we go outside at night, and you hear scary noises that make you wonder what that was. This film has plenty of those, enough to have your heart racing. 3.) Being the outsiders:  these people don't know their way around, they don't know the people or the forrest that well. With this, they are like fish out of water which can also cause confusion.  4.) The terror that lurks:  these people know that there is terror that lurks in the dark with them, and from time to time there will be some very terrifying and scary surprises. This is a horror film with no music soundtrack!  There's no suspense music, no gory make-up, no silly looking person wearing a hockey mask.  This is the kind of terror that is among us.  The kind we think about when we are alone. This is without a doubt one of the best movies of 1999! This is going to be placed among Independent Film Hall of Fame along with PULP FICTION, CITIZEN RUTH, BOUND,  TRAINSPOTTING, and LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS.  This is a excellent movie, and like the last movie that did this (SAVING PRIVATE RYAN) it makes you feel like that you are lost among these unfortunate souls.  Writer/Directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez have a successful hit on their hands.  They will more than likely be writing and directing some more movies for big studios in the future.  And don't be surprised that the stars will be making television appearances just to alert the pubilc that this is a fictional movie.  Or is it?  A terrfying masterpiece! ***** (out of *****)",8,1,2,16 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Entertainment at it's best!
","The previous summer hyped up films were always a bit of a disappointment. GODZILLA was horrible, ARMAGEDDON was only o.k., LOST WORLD was different, INDEPENDENCE DAY was silly, TWISTER was sillier, and BATMAN FOREVER was just plain stupid. Not since the original JURASSIC PARK as finally a summer hyped up film worth it.  And it had to take the brilliance and genius of George Lucas to save the summer movies with his latest installment of the famous STAR WARS films, THE PHANTOM MENACE. I'm guessing that some people aren't liking this film because they are either, A.) expecting to see something phenomenal and different  or B.) the greatest movie of all time.  I for one wanted to see something entertaining. And thank god I got entertainment! First of all, don't expect THE PHANTOM MENACE to be a full blown action/adventure picture.  Like EPISODE IV, (the original STAR WARS to you and me) there wasn't much action.  It was more of a character and plot development film.  It took EMPIRE and JEDI to show the trilogy had plenty of action.  And I think George Lucas is going to have tons of action in EPISODES II & III. But we're talking about EPISODE I, and it's a very well done film. Lucas proves his imagination is still strong with the different planets and creatures.  Hs has some very spectacular action scenes, the pod race is a STAR TOURS style fun race, and the fight scene between Qun-Gon-Jin, Obi-Won, and Darth Maul is very tense and exciting!  By the way I forgot to mention that Darth Maul is one vicious S.O.B. Liam Nesson, Ewan McGregor, and Natlie Portman are all very good in their performances.  Yeah, they are kinda 'cardboard' characters, but they try their hardest to make them real.  Jar-Jar Binks (the computer generated creature) is cute and funny (sometimes he's annoying).  And Jake Lloyd as Anakin is decent. However, sad to say, Lloyd is the flaw of the film.  I mean, Lloyd did a decent job playing Anakin, but he's too young!  Lucas should have a 15 or 16 year old play Anakin, not a 8 year old.  I can't believe an 8 year old boy, who hasn't gone through puberty yet, fall in love with a 16 year old beauty. That seemed a little unreal to me. Otherwise, is it worth the wait?  Is it as good as the other STAR WARS films?  Is it worth paying $7-$10 for?  Yes, yes, and yes.  It's well worth it.  It's not my personal favorite film of the year, but it comes close.  It is very entertaining, and that is all you should ask for.  I know some critics will say that they didn't like it, and they have that right.  I didn't like THE CRYING GAME, ENGLISH PATIENT, and USUAL SUSPECTS, and that's my American right.  Overall, EPISODE I is a delighful prequal to the classic trilogy, and I can't wait for 2002, for EPISODE II.  Is it a surprise that I give this film ***** (out of five)............. I guess not.  And I won't change my review in the future, I'm sticking with it.  DON'T MISS IT!!!!",9,0,1,20 May 1999
Ali," Ali Boma Ye!
","The comment is the chant that boxing legend Muhammed Ali was receiving when he Ziare in 1974 for his boxing match against George Foreman (traslation: Ali, kill him!).  This is the latest film from excellent director Michael Mann, who is one of the few directors working today who has a unique trademark, and the talent to go with it.   ALI is is a film that will have viewers understand why Ali was such a extradonary boxer and a famous figure. Cassius Clay who later changed his name to fit his Muslim belief to the now famous Muhammed Ali (Will Smith) was the most popular and best boxing contender in the 1960's and 70's.  He is nicknamed 'the champ' because he would win every boxing match that he competed in.  He is famous for his political beliefs as well as his boxing fights.  Ali was good friends with Muslim activist Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles), Malcolm would be by Ali's side whenever he was in trouble or in financial trouble.  This would lead to the government seeing Ali as a negative figure.  Such a loud mouth man in the 1960's who was African-American (sadly surrogation was still around at the time) and bad mouth the U.S. troops in Vietnam was the target of the U.S. government.   Ali refused to go fight in Vietnam because he has 'nothing against them Veitcong' was what Ali would say.  This would lead to his arrest and his scandal just because he didn't want to fight in a war that he didn't believe in.  Sadly, people today still spite Ali for his belief in the Vietnam War, yet we see political activist like Abby Hoffman as a hero when Hoffman only protested the war and didn't do anything else. The movie spans from the peak of Ali's career, from 1964 to 1974 (which is a wise move, since I don't want to see the tragic Ali-Hollyfield fight when Ali starting suffering from Parkinson's disease). I watched the excellent documentary WHEN WE WERE KINGS about five years ago and was hooked on the life of Muhammed Ali.  I was curious and entranced by how Ali would say cut downs in rhyme and be so hilarious at the same time.  I was also amazed to see on how such a fantastic fighter Ali was. Ali would go up against the biggest and scariest looking fighters (Sonny Linston, 'Smokin Joe' Fraizer, etc.) and no be afraid to fight at all.  Ali was the first athlete to be a athlete and entertainer.  Ali would entertain his audience when he was outside the ring with what he would say, and inside the ring by his punches. I thought ALI was a outstanding film, it does a great job on showing what makes Muhammed Ali one of the most important figures of the 20th century.  Will Smith does a brilliant job playing 'the champ' as he has the attitude and talk just like Ali does.  It shows that when an actor does a lot of homework for the real life person that they are going to be playing, they do such a amazing job that you think it's the real person when you're watching the film (i.e. Jim Carrey in MAN ON THE MOON, Woody Harrelson in PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT).  I am hoping that Smith gets at least a nomination for his role in this film (I would like to see him win, but since Ali is still a controversal figure, it wouldn't surprise me that if Smith gets overlooked).      The other acting in this film, especially by Jon Voight as legendary sportscaster Howard Cosell is top rate.  Mann does his usual skill and casts a wide range of stars to play in his films (like he did in HEAT and THE INSIDER), and with ALI, Mann casts another large cast of talented actors and actresses.  I not only enjoyed Voight, but I also enjoyed Jamie Foxx who played Drew 'Bundini' Brown, who is Ali's friend and co-trainer.  Other acting performances by Ron Sliver, Mario Van Peebles, Jeffrey Wright, Mykelti Williamson, and Will Smith's wife Jand Pinkett Smith all give a great support in the film. As for Mann's directing, he does a great job as he has done before.  He still can tell a epic story and making it exciting from start to finish. But unlike telling about a heist, or a whistle blower, this is about the career peak of person, and Mann uses his usual talent again.  The slow-motion movement, the close up shots of the actors, the lighting, and music are the trademarks that Mann has used in his career and shows it again in this film.  I didn't think ALI was as complex and intelligent as THE INSIDER or as brilliant as HEAT, but giving some time like fine wine, ALI will age gracefully to stand on it's own.  And when it does, it will be for one man's viewpoint of the world, instead of several people's view like in INSIDER or HEAT. I would find ALI to be the most powerful and entertaining film of this year.  Since there are excellent movies being released week after week this month, ALI has stood out above the rest with it's quality of storytelling and style.  I would just hope that ALI would be remembered in Febuary for the Oscars, and maybe Mann might get the Oscar he should have gotten two years ago for INSIDER (yea, I still think Mann did a better job than Sam Mendes!)     ALI is a film that similar to other films in the past tell about a person's life, and their view of the world.  And like the other films, you get a better understanding on why the character acted the way they did (like Larry Flynt and Andy Kaufman).  But that this is a story being told by Mann, the style with storytelling is what makes it unique and amazing.  This is the best film of 2001 (until maybe next week), but still, don't miss it! ***** (out of five)",10,0,1,20 December 2001
Catch Me If You Can," Spielberg does comedy, and succeeds!
","I've recently got a 'A' in one of my college classes titled, 'Spielberg/Lucas.' In that class the instructor lecture on the style of visual, characters, and plot for a Spielberg film. We made 'connections' with all of Spielberg's films, what did JAWS, E.T., CLOSE ENCOUNTERS, and SCHINDLER'S LIST all have in common? With Spielberg's latest film, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, is this the same Spielberg that is famous around the world?
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very different Spielberg film. It's a off beat comedy with a bit of suspense mixed into it. Critics and fans have been criticize Spielberg for the last twenty years for his attempt for doing a comedy film which was 1941. Now, Spielberg has managed to succeed in making a enjoyable comedy film. Where 1941 had tons of slapstick comedy and buildings falling apart in the name of laughs, CATCH ME is more from personality and wit. CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is based on the true story of Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio). Frank is known to be the most successful con-artist and check forger in U.S. history. Abagnale posed as a Pan-Am air pilot, doctor, and proscutor, when he didn't even complete high school. Abagnale also went around the world making and cashing about $4 million dollars with bogus checks. Despite that the checks would bounce like a rubber ball, Frank had enough intelligence to fool the banks and even the the companines he claimed he worked for. It took federal agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) to identify Frank's mistakes, which led Carl on a cross country pursuit for Frank. While Carl is staying around the clock trying to figure out more about Frank and his whereabouts, Frank keeps changing his name, occupation, and girlfriend. The only two people that remain close to Frank's life is Carl Hanratty, and Frank's father, Frank Abagnale Sr. (Christopher Walken). The film shows that one of the reasons why Frank remains to do his numerous crimes is to purchse expenisve things for his divorced father who is depressed from having his wife leave him on her request, and the closing of his family owned stationary store (where Frank learned about his numerous tricks of forgery). When I heard about CATCH ME being the new Spielberg film, I bought a copy of the book written in first person by the real Frank Abagnale. I highly enjoyed the book with the way Abagnale explains on what he did, how he did it, and the numerous funny parts that would be great to be put on film. After watching the movie, I was slightly disappointed in the film. There were some parts in Abagnale's book that I was looking so much forward to be seeing in the movie, including a part in the book where Abagnale gets involved with bailbonds man. Sadly to my disappointment, it wasn't featured in the film. I then read a interview on why Spielberg was so attached to direct CATCH ME IF YOU CAN, and when you watch the movie, it's obviously shown on the screen. Spielberg loved the father/son relationship between Frank Sr. and Jr. In fact, the relationship was partially mention in the book, in the film, it's carried thoughout the film. While the movie does touches on the various career changes and check forgery. Also, since the book was written in first person, the character of Carl Hanratty was mention here in there, where Hanratty is the second most seen character in the film, right behind Frank. But other than that, CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable and entertaining film. I've always been devoted to Mr. Spielberg, and this is a very different film for him. It is historical, takes place in the past, but it's the first time where most of the film is being told from one character's narrative. Spielberg does a great job with telling the story, he even adds a nice touch of the mid 60's film style and mood with the opening credits being animated, very similar to the opening credits of dozens of 60's comedies. Then John Williams also adds the final touch with the jazzy score that is heavy on the clarinet and brass than the usual strings. Most people groan and moan when they hear the name Leonardo DiCaprio, 'oh no! Not that guy!' I do agree DiCaprio does get overexposure, but he is a good actor. Look at WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and THIS BOYS LIFE, he did a excellent job in both films. I think most people just think of DiCaprio in TITANIC which wasn't his fault as much as it was James Cameron's. DiCaprio might win over some people with his performance in this film which shows that DiCaprio did understand the personality and that Frank had a fun time while doing all of the check swindeling. Christoper Walken breaks out of his stereotyped acting that many comedians and t.v. shows have made fun of in the past, and delivers a very good performance. Just watch the scene when he talks to Frank Jr. about his still love and devotion to the woman that left him for another man. But Tom Hanks is the pro, and he proves it again in this film. Hanks portrayal of Hanratty with the Boston accent and the combination of the clumsy actions yet intelligent mind makes the Hanratty character the most enjoyable federal agent since Tommy Lee Jones Sam Gerrad in THE FUGITIVE. Hanks did a brilliant job with Michael Sullivan in ROAD TO PERDITION, and he does it again with Carl Hanratty in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. I can not judge if CATCH ME IF YOU CAN should get any Oscar nominations (I haven't seen GANGS OF NEW YORK, ADAPTATION, and CHICAGO yet). But from what I've seen, CATCH ME is great, but it's not better than TWO TOWERS, MINORITY REPORT, SOLARIS, ROAD TO PERDITION, BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE, and PUNCH DRUNK LOVE. If there should be any nominations, then Hanks should get nominated for Best Supporting Actor for playing Hanratty.
CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is a very enjoyable film, it's a big risk of a film for Spielberg to return to comedy. But this film proves that Spielberg can now do any genre, including comedy, and pull it off. Great job Mr. Spielberg! ***** (out of five)",10,1,2,1 January 2003
Minority Report," Man on the Run.
","Steven Spielberg returns to his roots from his suspense of JAWS in his latest film, MINORITY REPORT.  Where his last film, A.I. was more of a film of wonder, MINORITY REPORTY is more of fear.  The best way to describe this film is: 'Spielberg does Hitchcock.'  It proves that when a old dog does tricks, he can do them well, and still impress people. MINORITY REPORT is based on the short story by the late Phillip K. Dick who wrote the novels for other sci-fi classics of BLADE RUNNER and TOTAL RECALL.  In Washington D.C. of the year 2054, the strongest police unit in the force is the 'precrime' unit.  With the precrime unit, a officer can detect and find out when and where a murder is going to happen before the act is even committed.  Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) feels that the system is perfect and  precrime is what is keep society safe.  John is then confronted by Ed Witwer (Colin Farrell) from the Attorney General's office who believes a theory: 'if they see the person committing a act of murder in the future, how do they know that the murderer didn't change their mind at the last minute?'  John sees this theory as nonsense until he is the next target of arrest for a murder of a man that he doesn't even know.  John who hunted down killers is now the hunted, with his old partner, Officer Fletcher (Neal McDonough) leading the force after John.  John must beat the countdown clock to zero to find out is he going to commit a act of murder and who is the victim? MINORITY REPORT has Spielberg return to the suspense genre with a big bang.  This is one excellent and mind-blowing film that will please everyone in the audience.  Where A.I. was for the thinking man and JURASSIC PARK was for the eye candy, MINORITY REPORT will please the intellects with the suspense filled Hitchcock plot and anti-punishment theme similar to Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  The ones for eye candy will enjoy the action scenes and the spectacular realistic effects of the future. My favorite is the transportation system of the everyday person and their express ways.     Another aspect of MINORITY REPORT that I enjoyed a lot was the use of blue and grey coloring.  From the very begining when the Fox and Dreamworks studio logo appear, it gives the viewer the clue on what type of movie this is going to be.  The coloring adds to the mood and tone of the story where this is a dark and mysterious future.  Credit should go to Spielberg and his regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who use the same coloring that was in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and much more different than the colorful A.I. and HOOK. I also did enjoy the editing by Michael Kahn and the scoring by the legendary John Williams, who are both Spielberg regulars.  Kahn does a great job by keeping the editing in a rapid pace, yet he gives the audience a chance to see what is going on.  There is never really a dull or worthless scene that is shown in MINORITY REPORT.  And John Williams does his Hitchcock style of music by doing a Bernard Herrman similar score from NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  Which would make sense since both movies are about that same theme, the man on the run. The only thing I would complain about MINORITY REPORT is the character development.  The actors all do a good job in their roles, but there isn't enough substance to understand on who the character's are.  The viewer does get to know who John Anderton is, but that is pretty much the only character on who the film focuses on.  There were some questions left open for me: Why did Witwer feel the system can have mistakes, yet he uses it to try to capture John?  Why is the relationship between Precrime Director Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and John Anderton so strong?       But that is small potatoes comparing with the rest of the film, and believe me the rest of the film succeeds!  I haven't had this much with a film in a while.  The suspense and action gives enough energy to make this two hour plus movie go by very quickly.  I have to give this movie credit, I did not look at my watch once to see what time it was.  I haven't done that with a movie in years. Where you have comic book action with SPIDER-MAN in one corner, the space opera of ATTACK OF THE CLONES in another corner, and the miltary gone wrong action of SUM OF ALL FEARS in the third corner.  I would reccommend that you go to the final corner and view the mystery/action/suspense of MINORITY REPORT.  And who knows, maybe after watching this movie, it might give you a different point of view on murder.  Spielberg returns to the excitement and fun similar to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and JURASSIC PARK with MINORITY REPORT.  Do yourself a favor and see this movie!  ***** (out of five)",10,0,0,20 June 2002
Erin Brockovich," Erin the savior.
","Director Steve Soderbergh is now three for three on directing both excellent and critical acclaim films, three years in a row!  First was his very witty and super hip 1998 hit, OUT OF SIGHT with George Clooney, and Jennifer Lopez (before she wanted to sing full-time).  Then last year was the stylish and dark THE LIMEY with Terrance Stamp in a role that was at least Oscar worthy of a nomination.  Now there is his newest film, a film that isn't as stylish or as hip as the previous two, but it's still a darn great movie. Soderbergh's newest film is ERIN BROCKOVICH, which is based on a true story.  The real life story has the title character (Julia Roberts) who is a single mother of three, who is looking for a job.  Erin will lie during her interview or anything, just so she can take care of her children.  Erin then goes to her attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), who eariler represented her in a car accident case, and begs for a job. Ed decides to give Erin a job and wants her to investigate a pro-bono case on a small California town called Hinkley who filed a lawsuit against the Pacific Gas & Electric company for contaminating the town's water supply and are aware of it.  It's so sad that the town's people are getting tumors, degenerative organs, and other freak symptoms; and the company tells the town citizens that everything is all right and the chemicals that they put in the water are suppose to 'help' the town. Well, Erin decides to investigate this problem, and becomes friends with many of the residents of Hinkley, including Donna Jensen (Marg Helgenberger) who is suffering from breast cancer, due to the posioning of the water. Meanwhile, Erin stirkes up a romantic relationship with a biker who just moved in next door named George, (Aaron Eckhart).  While Erin is looking for the truth with what is going on in Hinkley, George becomes the caretaker of the children, and isn't quite happy about it.  And also, Erin has problems of her own when Ed Masry hires a couple of high priced attorneys, Kurt Potter (Peter Coyote) and Theresa Dallevale (Veanne Cox) to take over the case of the lawsuit against Pacific Gas & Electric. Before you begin to shout, 'this sounds like A CIVIL ACTION or SILKWOOK,' well it isn't.  This is more of a movie that focuses in depth of one woman's crusade to reveal the truth, and go up against powerful attorneys, and a powerful company.  ERIN shows what a hard working mother has to go through to raise a family single handed and try to do well in her job.  In one touching scene, Erin is in tears as her boyfriend tells her over her cell phone that her youngest child started to say her first words. But Erin missed it, since she's devoting her time with her work on Hinkley. I was very impressed with Julia Roberts performance in ERIN BROCKOVICH. She isn't much of that 'cute girl next door' role that she is known for like in RUNAWAY BRIDE or PRETTY WOMAN.  Instead, she's vulgar, loud, and pushy, but also caring, committed, and heartfelt.  This film proves that Juila Roberts is a actress who is willing to take any role that she is given, and I think she should do more great serious acting roles like this one. People and critcs who also see Roberts wearing short and skin-tight clothes, only see this film skin deep. I was also enjoying the performance of Albert Finney, who I was very glad to see in a major film role.  Finney plays Ed very well, at times a boorish old man, at other times, a man who like Erin can be caring and have a heart.  Finney is also funny at times with his facial reactions to Erin's smart aleck remarks on his legal decisions and his own comments to Erin's comments.  It's hard to believe that this is the same man who played TOM JONES thirty-seven years ago. ERIN is a very well done film, in it's own way.  While SILKWOOD focused on revealing the truth, A CIVIL ACTION focused on the legal sense, ERIN focuses on what it takes to get the truth out in the open.  The pacing of the film is fast paced and entertaining (even for a film that is 131 mins.), the acting is great, and the story is very inspiring.  With such films as this one, and THE INSIDER, one wonders on how these big and powerful companies can get away with this illegal activity without being revealed.  Until then, the truth is out there, and it's on the local cinema.  ****1/2 (out of five)",8,1,1,21 March 2000
Meet the Parents," Focking Hilarious!!
","MEET THE PARENTS is a comedy like STRIPES, ANIMAL HOUSE, and TOOTSIE. It's a film that you'll still be laughing after watching it five times, as much as you did the first time.  As for director Jay Roach, I find this film to be his best personal achievement, far better than both AUTSIN POWERS films and MYSTERY, ALASKA.  And after watching this film, you'll more than likely agree with me. Ben Stiller stars as Greg Focker (that's F-O-C-K-E-R), a Chicago male nurse who is in love with school teacher Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo).  Just when Greg is about to propose to marriage to Pam, Pam gets a call on her cellular that her younger sister, Debbie (Nicole DeHuff) is getting married in a week after knowing the guy for a few months.  But what is all right with this marriage is that they got permission from Pam and Debbie's parents, Jack Byrnes (Robert DeNiro) and Dian Byrnes (Blythe Danner).  But it's Jack who calls the shots for the family. So as Greg and Pam head over to Long Island for Debbie's wedding, Greg figures that this is the perfect opportunity to get approval from Pam's father to marry her.  But Jack Byrnes is very protective of his 'first born child' and doesn't really care much for Greg.  Greg is very nervous and worried around Jack, and who can blame him, Jack has got to be the most intimidating father of all time.  As Greg keeps making accidental blunders around Jack, it makes Greg even more worried when Pam tells Greg that her father worked as a interrogation agent for the C.I.A.  Also, Jack favors and adores Pam's former fiance Kevin Rawley (Owen Wilson), who is a multimillionare who is a carpenter for a hobby.  So one mistake happens after another builds on top of each other making this a weekend of hell for poor Greg. Where director Jay Roach crashed with his last two comedies (AUSTIN POWERS 2, & MYSTERY, ALASKA) Roach scores again, if not his best score with this film.  I found this along with CHICKEN RUN to be the funniest film of this year.  I was laughing on and on again throughout this entire film that I nearly lost my voice.  And what makes it better is that like AIRPLANE and A FISH CALLED WANDA the jokes keep on coming to by the end you're tired from laughing so much. Both DeNiro and Stiller do very great jobs in this film. Stiller is fun as the poor fella Greg, similar to his Ted character in THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, Greg tries his hardest to make things right, but they turn out to be the opposite.  And Robert DeNiro is proving that his comedic work is just as excellent as his serious work.  With, ANALYZE THIS, WAG THE DOG, and my favorite film of all time MIDNIGHT RUN, DeNiro is a natural with the comedy genre.  And with this film, it shows that DeNiro still has his talent, after almost losing it in ADVENTURES OF ROCKY & BULLWINKLE.  The rest of the cast are also good, but Owen Wilson stands out as the very impressive Kevin. Before Jay Roach was making this movie, he said that the script was 'the funniest thing he has ever read.'  And by watching this film, you too can see on why this movie is so hysterical.  If Roach continues to make more movies like this one, he'll be a stand out in Hollywood. It's a shame that the American Film Institute has already picked the most funniest films of all time.  Since if they picked the films out later next year, PARENTS would have been at least on the top twenty as the top comeides of all time.  Even when I sit and write reviews, I still get chuckles from thinking about scenes from this movie.  This is quite a impressive fall season, after experiencing one of the most disappoining summers in film history.   With PARENTS, along with TITANS, NURSE BETTY, and ALMOST FAMOUS it seems that this fall there needed to be a funny and witty comedy, and MEET THE PARENTS is it! Don't miss it!!!!!!!!!!!!! ***** (out of five)",Null,0,0,6 October 2000
Unbreakable," Unbelievable.
","Unbelievable is the only word that I can describe the latest suspense-thriller from director M. Night Shyamalan.  This film is Shyamalan's anticipated follow up to his 1999 surprise and excellent THE SIXTH SENSE, which is titled UNBREAKABLE.  And all I can say about Shyamalan is that he is the Alfred Hitchcock of the 21st century.      UNBREAKABLE has Bruce Willis (who stared in Shyamalan's previous film) who plays David Dunn. David is a security guard who turns out to be the only survivor of a train wreck that kills over 100 people.  But what baffles most people isn't that David isn't the only survivor, but that he didn't even have a scratch or scar on him.  His son Jospeh (Spencer Treat Clark) is grateful that his dad is alive and wants to have more of a bonding relationship with him.  While David's soon to be ex-wife, Audrey (Robin Wright Penn), sees this 'miracle' as a second chance to start things over with her relationship with David.  But Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) who is a person who is so cripple that his bones break very easily, might have the answer to why David survived the crash.... And to be a good sport, that is all I am going to say about this film. Like SIXTH SENSE, this film has plot twist and turns that make it exciting and enjoyable to watch.  But if you're going in to expect another SIXTH SENSE, then you'll be disappointed.  But if you expect to see another excellent film directed by the very gifted Shyamalan, then you'll be very pleased, which happened to me.  When I see a Hitchcock film like TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST, I see them as two different movies made by the same director.  If you think they are 'follow-ups' then you'll hate NORTH BY NORTHWEST (god forbid!).  That is how you should see UNBREAKABLE, a different film that has the same director and star as the previous film. I highly enjoyed this film.  Shyamalan plays along with the audience with his amazing camera tricks and plot.  I sat there amazed during one scene where Willis was talking with a female on the train.  Shyamalan has the camera move back and forth between the two as if the audience were the eight year old girl watching them talk.  And the plot, it keeps you guessing and guessing until the end of the film to what is really going on. Another thing I noticed about Shyamalan is that he IS a director for children.  Like his underrated WIDE AWAKE, and his classic SIXTH SENSE, Shyamalan does a excellent viewpoint of the child's world in both movies.  And in UNBREAKABLE he does it again with the world through David's son, Joseph.  Joseph doesn't know on what to make of his father, being the only survivor of a disaster.  And young Spence Treat Clark does a performance like Haley Joel Osment in SIXTH SENSE, excellent!  If these children film stars were intelligent, they would work with Shyamalan, than any other typical family film director. Since it seems that Shyamalan is going to boost Clark's career. And not to forget the good performance by Robin Wright, who gives her best performance since FORREST GUMP.  Like Jenny in GUMP, both character's have been through a lot of pain and suffering in the past, and try on what they can do to make life better. But the film belongs to both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson.  Both actors give outstanding performances as the leads, Willis acting great as a confused human, while Jackson playing the mysterous character. Now is UNBREAKABLE better than SIXTH SENSE? No.  But is it good? Yes.  How good is it?  IT'S VERY GOOD!  This is a film that will have the people who saw and loved Hitchcock back in the 40's and 50's excited to see a young director trying the same similar styles that the master of suspense did.  As for the young viewers, I think they will be mixed.  The people who are very serious and devoted to the cinema will love this film. Others, beware!  But UNBREAKABLE is a great follow up to SIXTH SENSE, however I feel that this film will suffer the same way JACKIE BROWN and BIG LIBOWSKI suffered, 'it's not as good as the previous film.'  Yea, but that doesn't mean that you should skip it.  Go see this film, and don't expect much, that way you'll enjoy it more!   *****(out of five)",Null,1,1,29 November 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," It's funny the first time around.....
","I'm a SOUTH PARK fan, I highly enjoy the t.v. show, and I have every episode on tape.  So this means that I should enjoy this film, right?  Yes and no.  First of all, I do enjoy rude and raunchy comedy, I liked BIG DADDY a lot, and I enjoyed BASEketBALL. But sometimes a film that has a lot of potential, can fail also. The plot of the show has the four guys (Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny) going to see a 'R' rated Terence & Phillip movie. If you haven't seen the show, then you probably won't get the jokes or character's traits that much.  After seeing the film, the guys walk around and start using the foul words, that Comedy Central usually 'bleeps' out. Because of this, Kyle's mom, decides to organize a strike not only against Terence & Phillip, but against all of Canada! I have two words of advice for Trey Parker:  1.)  A joke is funny first time around, but annoying the second, third, even the fifth time around. & 2.) Less is always better!  There are jokes in SOUTH PARK that are funny to watch the first time around, but then when the joke is repeated and repeated and so forth, it's not only not funny, it's very annoying!  And less is always better.  Trey Parker decides to have the movie begin with a song and dance, that's funny.  But he decides to have the ENTIRE movie have songs and dances, it's not a comedy, it's a opera?!?!? I'm guessing that Trey Parker is  taking advantage of the Disney animated film philosophy, 'I can't tell you how I feel, but I can sing it for you!' And sing these characters do.  Not just the main characters, but almost every character!!! I did enjoy BASEketBALL, and I did think ORGAZMO was decent, but SOUTH PARK was a disappointment.  It can be a witty and original show, and there are some episodes that prove it. But the movie decides to go on the movie bandwagon and just have the t.v. show episodes be funnier than the movie.  I also think that Parker wanted to show everybody how talented he is with song lyrics, that's fine.  He proved that with CANNIBAL: THE MUSICAL, but with SOUTH PARK, well......... it's boring.  Sad to say, this 85 min. film seemed to go on too long for me, and I can sit  through SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and TITANIC four times with no problem.  While all of the critc's are going to try to be 'hip' and recommend this film, I suggest you catch BIG DADDY first, then SOUTH PARK, then AUSTIN POWERS 2.  It's not horrible, but it's not great.   ***1/2 (out of *****)",Null,0,0,30 June 1999
The Mummy," An entertaining matinee movie.
","This is a modern 'B' movie of the 40's and 50's mixed in with 90's style and effects.  Directed by Steven Sommers, who has worked with action before (THE JUNGLE BOOK ;1994;, and DEEP RISING). The film is about two teams, one led by the rip-roaring Rick O' Connell (Brendan Fraiser) who brings along a beautiful English archaeologist (Rachel Wesiz) and her often drunk brother (John Hannah).  The other team are greedy Americans who are led by Sommer's regular Kevin J. O'Connor and they bring along an Egyptolgist (Johnathan Hyde).  The two teams are trying to make it to Hamunaptra (the City of the dead) where it's loaded with tons of treasures. Once they reach the ancient city of the dead, they are warned by a traditional army to stay away from the city and to leave immediately. The foreigners don't really care, until they realized that they found the book of the dead, and once it's read, the dead priest, will rise and won't be stopped, until all who have awakened him are killed and till he takes over the world. This is a 'matinee' movie, it doesn't mean that it should be only watched in the matinee, but it reminds you of a old-fashion action film.  Along the same lines as RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, it has plenty of mixutre of terror, action, humor, and of course, gross bugs.  The actors do a respectable 'B' movie job, Brendan Fraiser stands out as a typical Sommer's action hero (if you've seen DEEP RISING, you'll know what I mean).  Rachel Wesiz plays a very pretty heroine, and John Hannah is the 'side-kick' that the audience will be rooting for. This is an entertaining movie, it's no classic, but it is worth watching. It is very fast paced, and it does grab your attention throughout the two hour plus movie.  It's fun, and worth a look at.  It will keep the movie freaks entertained for this weekend and possibly the following weekend, at least until THE PHANTOM MENACE opens.  **** out of *****",Null,0,0,5 May 1999
Chicken Run," A brilliant masterpiece for the 21st Century!
","Nick Park, the director of the award winning WALLACE & GROMIT shorts has finally released his first major film titled CHICKEN RUN.  And I personally rank Nick Park on the same level of family entertainment as other such entertainers as John Lasseter, Jim Henson, and Walt Disney.  Each of these men take a different form of style to tell a fascinating story in a fantasy world. Though computer animation, to puppets, to animation, to claymation, all of these forms of entertainment will both amaze and wow children of all ages. CHICKEN RUN is to THE GREAT ESCAPE, what A BUG'S LIFE was to SEVEN SAMUARI or MAGNIFICANT SEVEN.  CHICKEN has a group of chickens who live on Tweedy's farm.  The chickens are to produce at least five eggs a day, and if they don't they become supper for the Tweedy's.  The chicken farm is run by the sadistic Mrs. Tweedy (voiced by Miranda Richardson), and her not to bright husband, Mr. Tweedy (Tony Haygarth).  The profits for the egg business are running low so Mrs. Tweedy comes across a offer to make chicken pot pies.  Which spells doom for the chickens on the farm.  Ginger (Julia Sawalha) has been leading the chickens on many various escapes, but they all fail.  Then hope arises in the form of a rooster, Rocky the Rooster (Mel Gibson).  Rocky just escaped from the circus, and is a feature attraction.  So to cut a deal, Ginger will keep her mouth shut, if Rocky helps teach the chickens on how to fly.      CHICKEN RUN is very similar to the brillance of both TOY STORY movies and BABE.  The animals and animation are cute and funny, while the jokes are very witty and funny.  Such lines as: 'my egg shell was bigger than that place,' and 'you're a 20 minute egg, aren't you?' are some of the cleaver dialogue featured in the film.      The voices from the actors are also well done.  Gibson, Sawalha, and Richardson are all good doing the vocal talents for their characters.  And I also enjoyed Imelda Staunton as the not too bright Bunty. And the animation is among Nick Park's best.  It's just as enjoyable and funny as any of the Wallace and Gromit adventures, and what makes the film spectacular is that Park uses different camera angles for the claymation.  I have to give high credit to that originality.      CHICKEN RUN is among not only the best film of the year, but also one of the best family films of all time.  I just hope that Americans will see the creativty that is coming over from Great Britian with this film.  If you loved the enjoyable TOY STORY films and A BUG'S LIFE, and even if you love Wallace & Gromit, then CHICKEN RUN is one of the few films this year that is worth the price of admission.  And it's a film that is just as enjoyable to see the second time around as it is the first time!  ***** (out of five)",10,0,0,22 June 2000
Insomnia," How Do You Sleep?
","The world for Will Dormer is dark, yet he is in the most lit up place in the world for the time of year.  Will is in Nightmute, Alaska where in the summertime the sun never sets since it's so far up North. Which leads to Will's suffering of insomnia, or is it the conscience that is inside of Will which is keeping him awake?INSOMNIA is the remake of the 1997 classic that was directed by Erik Skjoldbjaerg and starring Stellan Skarsgard.  The plot is pretty much the same for both movies.  For this version, a murder of a teenage female in the quant town of Nightmute has shocked and stunned the residents.  Los Angeles detectives Will Dormer (Al Pacino) and Hap Eckhart (Martin Donovan) are brought in to further investigate the murder.  Will is very popular with the law enforcement in Nightmute by being an aquaintance of Chief Charles Nyback (Paul Dooley) and as a object of admire and inspiration by one of the detectives, Ellie Burr (Hilary Swank).  While in Nightmute, Will is facing problems internally with a internal affairs situation back in L.A. where his partner Hap might testify against him.  But the real trouble begins when a little known detective novelist, Walter Finch (Robin Williams) begins playing mind games with Will which adds to his insomnia and loss of sanity.INSOMNIA is a excellent and slightly better remake than it's '97 original. I watched my birthday present Criterion DVD of the original a few weeks ago in anticipation of the remake. With this version I was excited to compare/contrast the two films.  What made me enjoy this version more is the acting, cinematography, and directing.First, the acting by the actors is outstanding.  Pacino gives his best acting performance since THE INSIDER.  He shows the pain and insanity that poor Will is going through with his expressions and dialogue.  One great scene has Will noticing every little sound being made while at the police station.  Will is very similar to Pacino's Vincent Hannah from Michael Mann's classic HEAT.  A character that knows what he is doing, but has the conflict on doing the right thing.Williams does his best acting job since THE FISHER KING giving a new face to terror.  Williams character of Finch is not loud,  obnoxious and over the top like most modern villians (Denzel Washington in TRAINING DAY comes to mind right away).  No, Finch is calm, collective, crafty, and very dangerous making him one of the scariest villians in film history (along with Anthony Hopkins in SILENCE OF THE LAMBS comes to my mind right away).Swank does a superb job playing the above average female detective who proves that she's all brains and not looks (although she does look attractive in this film).  Swank gives a performance that is little seen in most police dramas where the woman is usually playing the wife, or the police detective that is briefly seen.The cinematography by Wally Pfister is breathtaking.  Showing the beautiful snow-capped and glaicer mountains of British Columbia with the lighting of making it appear daylight all the time is a photographer triumph.  Pfister does a great job by also setting the light up for the mood of the scene.The final praise should go to director Christopher Nolan.  The director who hit a home-run with last years surprise classic MEMENTO, hit's another home-run with INSOMNIA.  I love the way Nolan pretty much remained faithful to the original '97 version and added more scenes of action and character development with his version.  And what I loved the most is how such a beautiful town like Nightmute could have such terror with a young girl's murder.All and all INSOMNIA is a film that should be remembered come next Feburary. If anyone deserves a Oscar for this film is Pacino for his outstanding acting in this film.  And Williams deserves a Supporting Actor Oscar for his role.  Hey, if Hopkins and Foster got Oscars for LAMBS then Pacino and Williams deserve Oscars as well.I know, it might be nine months early to determine who should get Oscars or not.  And I'm sure that I'll eat my words come September or December when I see another film with fantastic acting or directing.  But INSOMNIA is one film that should at least be remembered with some nominations.  This is one scary, yet brilliant film!!!  ***** (out of five)",Null,0,0,28 May 2002
X-Men," X-traordinary!!!
","The biggest and most anticipated film of the summer is finally released.  For years, comic book fans have been waiting for big screen adaptations of Fantastic Four, Spider Man, and now finally released, X-MEN. And what can I say about X-MEN but not since DICK TRACY and the original BATMAN (1989) have I seen a fantastic and exciting film based on a comic book.  This movie is way better than SPAWN and BLADE, it does make the comic book film genre alive again for the new millennium. X-MEN focuses on two characters, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) also called Logan (love that name!!!) and Rogue (Anna Paquin). They discover that they are outcasts of society, called mutants.  Where Wolverine can heal his own wounds and have sharp claws come out of his fists, Rogue can feel other people's or mutants energy and power.  They are attacked by the powerful evil mutant Sabertooth (Tyler Mane) before they are rescued by Cyclops (James Marsden) and Storm (Halle Berry). Wolverine and Rogue are taken to a university for mutants led by Professor Charles Francis Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his assoicate Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen).  Professor X tells the two newcomers that their mutant powers can help protect society, a society that is afraid of them. However, evil Magneto (Ian McKellen) wishes to use his powers to destroy a society that betrayed him and his team including Sabertooth, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos) and Toad (Ray Park).  Together, the X-Men must stick together to save a society that fears them. I never did read any of the X-Men comics (I was more into the Dark Knight and Captain America).  But from watching this movie, I was very impressed!  There was non-stop action and excitement, and director Bryan Singer doesn't pull any punches with any corny plot, characters, or dialogue.  I was at first disappointed in it's 109 minute running time, but after watching the film, it's so fast paced, that there are no slow scenes. The acting by all of the cast members are great, with kudos going out to Anna Paquin as Rogue and newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  Although, most of the film centers around these two, they both did a great job with their characters, especially Jackman, he's a fantastic Wolverine! And support from McKellen, Stewart, Janssen, Berry, and Marsden also add flavor to the film.  That is why I enjoyed this movie, there is more than one character to enjoy.  Unlike the original BATMAN where the viewer was intrested in Batman and the Joker, there are so many characters to be engrossed with. And the directing is fantastic, from the tricky camera angles, to the fast pacing, Singer makes this film a true comic book film.  Puls I also enjoyed the special effects, the sets, costumes, and music by Michael Kamen. This is another eagerly awaited film, along with EPISODE I that delivers the goods, and then some.  It is action packed, you do see quite a few X-Men characters, and it is in a comic book style.  I highly enjoyed this film, and I'll be the first or one millionth person in line for the sequal.

Sleepy Hollow," Another wonderful Tim Burton film.
","Tim Burton has always done films that are sympathetic towards outcasts in society.  The Wiona Ryder character in BEETLEJUICE, Bruce Wayne/Batman in the BATMAN films, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, and ED WOOD.  Now the outcast is Ichabod Crane (Johnny Deep), a man in 1799 New York, who believes that a crime should be investigated, instead of getting a immediate punishment.  It's Ichabod's belief that has him get a assignment to investigate the gruesome murders in the town of Sleepy Hollow. The plot is loosely based on Washington Irving's classic tale of the battle between the superstitious school teacher and the deadly headless horseman.  In this version, instead of being a school teacher, Crane is now a constable who uses science and gadgets to solve the crimes committed in Sleepy Hollow.  While in Sleepy Hollow, Crane discovers that it's not only the murders of people getting beheaded are mysterous but also the townsfolk.  There's Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) who either wants to love or harm Ichabod.  There's Katrina's father, Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon) and his wife Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), and the town priest (Jeffrey Jones), the town doctor (Ian MacDirmad), political official (Richard Griffiths) and Katrina's boyfriend (Casper Van Dein). This may not be a faithful version to the classic Irving tale, it is however a very enjoyable film.  Tim Burton does remain faithful to the characters from the tale.  Ichabod does appear to be brave on the outside, but is actually terrified on the inside.  Katrina is both very beautiful and mysterous.  And the headless horseman is indeed very very terrifying.  Yet, this film is faithful to the classic Walt Disney version by adding 'inside' jokes that were also featured in the animated version. Like Burton's other films, this is a dark and gothic film, that is one of the reason's on why I highly enjoyed it. The scenes are so wonderfully constructed and beautiful.  The set designs in SLEEPY HOLLOW are gorgeous!  They are so beautiful that they are screaming to be getting a Oscar in March.  Also, the cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki is outstanding!  Lubezki is probably going to be going up against Robert Richardson (BRINGING OUT THE DEAD) and Dante Spinotti(THE INSIDER) for best cinematography in March also.  The shots are at the same time both beautiful and scary, a very rare accomplishment in film. And the music by Danny Elman, is at it's usual greatness.  I'm sure that he'll get nomminated againfor his wonderful score for this film, but he'll probably get snubbed for your usual Disney animated score. What I was disappointed in with SLEEPY HOLLOW is the ending.  I won't give away to what happens, but all I could say is that I could have thought of something better.  But, why complain about the color of the couch inside a beautiful mansion?  I still highly reccommend this film!  ****1/2 (out of five)",Null,0,0,21 November 1999
Ocean's Twelve," Twelve is different than Eleven.
","To be honest, I saw this movie back in August at a special advance screening. I was actually so overwhelmed because I got to meet and talk to Steve Soderbergh before and after the film. In my opinion, Soderbergh is one of the few directors whose films I can trust for quality entertainment, intellect, and style. But to review the movie back then would have been unfair, it's like judging the first demo take of the Beatles song 'Strawberry Fields Forever' before George Martin added the tape loops.So I decided to wait and review the movie after seeing the final cut, and I was actually pleased that I did that, because just like what I've been telling people for four months and will continue to tell people 'Twelve is different that Eleven.' 'Oh, o.k. so it's not good.' Is what most reactions are after I make that comment. 'No, not true,' I replied. OCEANS TWELVE is different that OCEANS ELEVEN, the same way KILL BILL VOL. 1 was different that KILL BILL VOL. 2. VOL. 1 was the ultimate homage to the films of the Shaw Bros., VOL. 2 was the homage to the Spaghetti Westerns. OCEANS ELEVEN captured the hip and cool feel of the Vegas heyday of the 60's, when Frank, Dino, Peter, Sammy, and Pal Joey ruled the strip. OCEANS TWELVE captures the European feel when Truffaut, Godard, and Fellini were kings of the art house cinemas. OCEANS TWELVE takes place three years after the infamous 'Belligo heist' when Danny Ocean (Clooney), gathered his crew of men and managed to steal over $160 million dollars from casino Mongol, Terry Benedict (Garcia). Now Benedict has tracked Ocean and his entire crew, and the situation has turned into what Danny's wife Tess (Roberts) alerts Danny about Benedict knowing who did the heist, 'the basement is flooded and the lights are out.' So Danny gathers his entire crew back together again: Rusty (Pitt), Linus (Damon), Basher (Cheadle), Saul (Reiner), Ruben (Gould), the 'Mormon twins' (Affleck & Caan), Yen (Qin), Dell (Eddie Jemison), and Frank (Mac). The first scene when the entire crew are all together manages to create some nice witty in-joke laughs, such as Turk Malloy questioning Ocean, 'and since when was this called 'Oceans Eleven?'' The problem is that Benedict knows who pulled off the heist three years ago, he's angry and wants all $160 million dollars back, plus three years worth of interest. The problem, Ocean and his crew can't pull off any job in America since their faces are well known. The solution, go overseas to Europe and pull off another heist to payback Benedict.Yet there is still two other problems, first, it turns out that Rusty had a relationship with Isabel (Zeta-Jones) and suddenly left her after she was about to find out the person who pulled off a heist was actually Rusty. Now Isabel is one of the top detectives of the Euro-Pol force for the crime division. Second, there is another master thief Toulour (Cassel), who calls himself 'the Fox' decides to have some fun of his own with Ocean and his crew. OCEANS TWELVE succeeds the same way OCEANS ELEVEN did, is one of the most enjoyable, witty, and entertaining movies of the year. Yet, like KILL BILL VOL. 2, OCEANS TWELVE is more plot and character orientated. And with OCEANS ELEVEN where the focus of the romance was Danny and Tess; OCEANS TWELVE it focuses on Rusty and Isabel, with some very enjoyable flashback scenes. Soderbergh again has a batting average of Barry Bonds, and hits another home run with this film. His directing is fantastic, capturing the look, mood, and feel of the European heist films such as GRAND SLAM, the original Italian JOB, and TOPKAPI. Such as the pan of the camera to focus on a particular character, the rapid zoom close-up shots, and the freeze shot before cutting to another scene. Yet he blends it well with modern European style with the technology, talk, and fashion of the modern hip world. I mean, I would love to hang out with this crew! I also highly enjoyed the soundtrack music supervised and composed by David Holmes (who also did Soderbergh's OCEANS ELEVEN and OUT OF SIGHT). Holmes did a great job using his very hip-techno mixes and songs and mixing it well with 60's era European artist such as actress/singer Ornella Vanoni, and composer Piero Umiliani. And the performances are fun and enjoyable to watch. It is obvious that all of the cast members had a fun time while making this movie, and it shows. Yet, that doesn't mean that the viewer should be left out, since there are some witty scenes that make a lot of reference to the previous film, the way Linus trying to understand how Danny and Rusty operate, and about the twelfth member of the crew looking like somebody else. While OCEANS TWELVE doesn't have a intelligent or great plot like COLLATERAL, SIDEWAYS, RAY, or THE INCREDIBLES. It does exactly what it promises. It promises fun, enjoyment, and laughs, and that is exactly what you will get when watching OCEANS TWELVE. This isn't the most intellectual film of the year, but it is the best looking, and one of the most entertaining and best films of this year. Hats off to Soderbergh, Holmes, writer Geoge Nolfi, and the entire cast for OCEANS TWELVE, for making a delightful film! ***** (out of five)",10,5,8,11 December 2004
MASH," The first Robert Altman classic.
","When I say the title 'MASH' most people think of the t.v. show with Alan Alda.  Yet, there was a time when there was only the movie, and the movie was just as successful as the hit t.v. show.  I personally find the movie to be far more different and far more better than the CBS prime-time hit.  Since this is a Robert Altman film, and Altman (before his NASHVILLE and PLAYER days) this was a little film that went on to be big. MASH takes place during the Korean War, Cpt. 'Hawkeye' Pierce (Donald Sutherland) and 'Duke' Forrest (Tom Skerritt) arrive at a hospital unit not too far away from the front lines of the Korean War.  They are doctors who are to take care of the sick and wounded from the war.  Sad to say, the wounded get 'stitched' up and sent out on the lines again.  So the only way for the doctors to keep their sanity, it to have fun at the base.  They later get another partner in crime named 'Trapper John' McIntyre (Elliott Gould) who turns out to be a aly of Hawkeye and Duke, and a enemy to bible quoteing Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) and 'Hot Lips' Houlihan (Sally Kellerman).      MASH isn't really much of a major plot movie, it's more of a movie that has a very funny series of jokes.  And this is quite controversial at the time, since the film was released during the Vietnam War.  And the cleaver irony is that like Vietnam, this war was a 'police' war against the Communist, and Altman uses many ironic similarites between the two wars.  But for today's standards the film is quite funny! I was lucky to see this film on the big screen this past weekend.  This is another film, as always, to see on the big screen first.  With it's Panavision lense, the viewer does get the full aspect ratio of Altman's classic.  But it's also fun to see on the big screen since one does get to see everything that they would have missed on t.v. But this was a funny movie!  From the radio under the bunk at Hot Lips bed, to the trip to Tokyo, to the classic football game, this is a movie that is far more funnier than 70% of comedies that are released today.  I just wish that screenwriters would watch this film and take some notes on how to make a funny and witty comedy.  This film is a fun treat to see, to get a glimpse of Altman before he became Robert Altman. The greatest American directors have a successful film that put their foot in the studio doors, before their names were put on the maps.  Speilberg had JAWS, Socrsese had MEAN STREETS, Lucas has AMERICAN GRAFFITTI, and Altman has MASH.  It's no surprise that this film is on the American Film Institute's top 100 films of all time, it well deserves it.  If you never seen MASH, do yourself a favor and rent this classic film, before you watch the t.v. show.  It's obvious that the magic touch is gone without Altman at the helm.  ***** (out of five)",Null,0,1,9 February 2000
"Monsters, Inc."," Where the Wild Things Are.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** MONSTERS INC. reminded me of the classic children's book by Maurice Sendak, 'Where the Wild Things Are.'  Both stories are about the imagination of monsters living in children's closets, but these monsters aren't dangerous, they are harmful and friendly.  Where in 'Wild Things Are' the monsters enjoy the company and playtime with the main child character, Max. MONSTERS INC.  the monsters are actually terrified by the presence of a child or anything that is human for that matter.  In fact, the monsters are more afraid of the children than the children are of them, nice irony. MONSTERS INC. is about two power plant factory workers in the city of Monsteroplois, James P. 'Sulley' Sullivan (voiced by John Goodman) and Mike Wazowski (voiced by Billy Crystal).  Sulley is the number one monster frightner for the factory, as Mike is Sulley's loyal assistant, roommate, and friend. The monsters have assign doors placed in front of them which leads them to the closets of real world into children's bedrooms so they can scare the children. The monsters of the city need the screams a child gives when they see a monster, that is how they get their energy.  The film even does a witty sub-plot to the real-life California rolling blackout energy crisis.  Sulley is admired by his co-workers and his boss Henry J. Waternoose (James Coburn), while Mike has a flirting romance with the company secretary, Celia (Jennifer Tilly). Everybody likes the winning duo except for the jealous Randall Boggs (Steve Buscemi) a chameleon-like monster who adapts his skin to his surroundings so he can hide. Randall has been putting in unofficial 'scare hours' so he can be the top monster at Monsters Inc. It's when Sulley accidently opens up one of Randall's closet doors to find a small girl, who Sulley calls 'Boo' has enter into the monster world.  There is a eariler scene that is horrifying realistic in today's time when a child's sock is stuck to a monster and the decontamination a monster goes through for his and everyone else's protection.  With Boo in the monster world, things can be catastrophic. Sulley and Mike try to hide Boo (even dressing her up like a monster) as they look through the billions of closet doors, to find the right one to her bedroom, as Randall wants Boo for a diabolical scheme that he plans to use her for.  But it when Sulley and Mike try to help Boo find her way home, that they begin to both feel like parents and want to help and protect the infant child. After getting a sour taste of this year's computer animated films (yes I'm talking about SHREK), MONSTERS INC. proves that Pixar and Disney animation is a winning combination and shouldn't be competed with.  Where SHREK was full of potty jokes and mugging the camera, MONSTERS actually tells a story that has a lot of depth and meaning behind it.  SHREK wanted to do cut-down jokes (especially to Disney films), MONSTERS INC. instead takes a different path and does jokes about life in general and the monster's lives are similar to our own. I found MONSTERS INC. to be another winner from Pixar, who are so far 4 to 1 on my scoreboard for successful computer animated films (only Dreamworks SHREK being the only point for the other team).  If people are asking themselves, 'gee there's SHREK, FINAL FANTASY, and JIMMY NEUTRON, how can MONSTERS INC. be any better?'  Well that's simple, it's like saying how is a ride at Disneyland better than a ride at a carnival.  Where a lot of film studios and companies are adapting to computer animated films, Disney always manages to stay a few steps ahead of it's competitor's.  First, look at the millions of hairs that cover the wooly Sulley, the scenes when he runs you can see the hairs gently move from the breeze.  Second, the human child of Boo looks more realistic than any of the generic humans in SHREK. Third, there is much more color with the Pixar films, I figured this out when ANTZ and A BUG'S LIFE were released three years ago.  Finally, the messages and morals behind the Pixar/Disney films are more original, where MONSTERS tells the viewer that don't judge a book by it's cover, that the most terrifying looking things can be the most caring.  And that it's difficult to be a parent but with teamwork and care, it can work!  Where SHREK is doing the things aren't what they seem moral which Disney did 60 years ago with DUMBO, and DUMBO was much more cuter, charming, and more touching than a obnoxious loud orge. It doesn't surprise me that MONSTERS INC. was directed by former SIMPSONS producer David Silverman, and Pixar veteran Peter Docter.  Disney had some competition this year for computer animated films, while Dreamworks had a royal flush, Disney won by having the royal flush straight, and should win the Oscar for best Animated film this year.  Until the magic and wonder of Mr. Potter is released, this is one film that Potter fans (children and children at heart) will love and wanting more, just like I did!  ***** (out of five)",10,0,1,10 November 2001
Notting Hill," A very wonderful romance.
","Call me a sensitive sap, but I really enjoyed NOTTING HILL, the new wonderful comedy staring Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant.  The one thing I enjoyed about the movie is the premise.  A struggling travel book-store owner (Grant) falls in love with a world famous superstar/actress (Roberts). During the romance the couple face with many difficulties, tabloids, cruel gossip, and another relationship. The movie takes a nice approach with the Roberts and Grant characters. Roberts is a celebrity who's more concerned with her reputation than her feelings.  While Grant is just in love with a girl, a very famous girl in that point.  The romanitc dialogue is fantastic, Grant has never done a better job in his carrer.  Instead of playing his usual mumbling self, Grant plays a man who is suffering since he's in love with a woman who has much more power and popularity than him. Why I like this movie a lot is because I can relate to the Grant character.  I know what it feels like to fall in love with someone who is a million miles away and more famous than you. It is quite painful, and Grant does a wonderful job expressing his pain and suffering. Roberts is good as usual, however, she's pretty much playing herself.  A world famous actress who is a first more concerned about her carrer than for her own feelings. The supporting cast is also fun, especially Rhys Ifans, who plays Grant's sex obsessed and filthy roommate (and I mean filthy physically, as well as mentally). Like other recent romance movies such as 'YOU'VE GOT MAIL,' 'CHASING AMY,' and 'JERRY MAGUIRE' NOTTING HILL is a fun and very pleasant romantic film. And with PHANTOM MENACE coming out a week before it, I'm sure it will draw the people who already seen or don't want to see STAR WARS.  But this is a fun movie, I'm not sure if the guys will like it, but I know the ladies will.  A delightful fun film!  ****1/2 (out of five)",Null,0,0,18 May 1999
The Aviator," Perhaps the best movie of 2004!
","Leave it to Martin Scorsese, he is one of the few reliable directors who graces in age, still manages to make outstanding movies. I thought his previous film; GANGS OF NEW YORK was the best film of 2002 (and still stand by that comment). Scorsese who was once known for showing us the gritty realistic world of New York City's 'Mean Streets' with the Little Italy thugs (MEAN STREETS), anti-hero loners (TAXI DRIVER), fallen hero (RAGING BULL), bizarre world of Soho (AFTER HOURS), realistic thugs (GOODFELLAS), gangsters controlling Las Vegas (CASINO; it wasn't in NYC, but it still had the similar theme), guilt ridden paramedic (BRINGING OUT THE DEAD), and the war between immigrants (GANGS OF NEW YORK). This is the Scorsese that all of us know about and remember. Yet Scorsese was also responsible for telling us about a single mother in the southwest struggling to survive (ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE), the final farewell concert of a fantastic rock/folk group The Band (THE LAST WALTZ), and the story of Jesus Christ (LAST TEMPTATION OF Christ). Now Scorsese has become the storyteller of one of the most enthusiastic and eccentric billionaires of recent years, Howard Hughes.In THE AVIATOR, Scorsese portrays Howard Hughes (Leonardo DiCaprio) as several different roles: filmmaker, womanizer, entrepreneur, engineer, germ-phobic, and aviator. The film tells about the achievements that Hughes accomplished such as the movies HELL'S ANGELS & THE OUTLAW, the building of an airplane that can fly above 20,000 feet, acquiring TWA and making it a international airline, and the design and building of the largest airplane ever the Hercules (now known as the Spruce Goose). Yet Hughes went through so many conflicts with his business: Pan Am Airline chief Juan Trippe (Alec Baldwin), Maine Senator Ralph Owen Brewster (Alan Alda), Louis B. Mayer (Stanley DeSantis); his romance: Katharine Hepburn (Cate Blanchett), Ava Gardner (Kate Beckinsdale); and himself: paranoia, and obsession compulsion disorder.THE AVIATOR discusses all of those elements in rich detail, that after watching the movie, you begin to realize the amazing accomplishments that Hughes did. Wonder why the only thing we most remember about Hughes was being a recluse who was afraid of germs. And would like to know more about Howard Hughes and see the films that were discussed in the film.This isn't a Scorsese film that people want another TAXI DRIVER, GOODFELLAS, CASINO, or RAGING BULL would expect. This is a different kind of Scorsese, one who is telling a story about a man, who is no different that him. A dreamer who dreams big and ignores what his advisors, and partners tell him, then come up with projects with amazing results. DiCaprio proves that he his under-appreciated actor in this film. While most of the public see him as that goofy kid who shouts, 'I'm king of the world!' in TITANIC. Yet most don't realize his talent with such roles as in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN. THE AVIATOR shows that DiCaprio is a great actor, giving a realistic portrayal of the eccentric Hughes in some scenes, and a man who cleanses the germs that represent people he dislikes or negative incidents. Blanchett does a amazing job with her performance of Katherine Hepburn with the way her head is tilted back to the pronunciation of words to the snobbish like personality she has when she is around her parents. While Beckinsdale also does a great job playing the very sexy Ava Gardner who has a love/hate relationship with Hughes, a woman who hates him at times, but will help him when he needs help.The supporting performances by John C. Reily, Ian Holm, Alec Baldwin, Alan Alda, Danny Huston, and Matt Ross are all top rate and also deserve recognition as well.And Scorsese proves that he one of the best directors of all time with several elements. First the pacing of the story, the film never drags and at running time of 169 mins. it kept my attention on what was going to be happening next. Second, some of the scenes of the film were of complete beauty and wonder. One scene that blew my mind was during the filming of the aerial scenes from HELLS ANGELS which showed how dangerous it was filming the dogfight scenes from that film, seventy years before computer generated images would replace that technique. Third, the acting by the actors was top notch and very convincing. Finally, the story of Howard Hughes himself was unique and original and I think there will never be another person like Howard Hughes. This has been quite a year of movies: COLLATERAL, SIDEWAYS, KILL BILL VOL. 2, THE INCREDIBLES, RAY, A VERY LONG ENGAGEMENT, THE TERMINAL, FAHRENHEIT 9/11, BOURNE SUPREMENCY, OCEANS TWELVE, CRIMINAL, SPIDER-MAN 2, MEAN GIRLS, HARRY POTTER & PRISONER OF AZKABAN, and SPANGLISH were all films that were amazing and all were among my favorite films of this year (yet I still need to see LIFE AQUATIC and FINDING NEVERLAND). But I think it will be hard to beat THE AVIATOR, for it's story, characters, and epic feel. The Academy has snubbed Scorsese for 30 years; they did the same thing for Roman Polanski until THE PIANIST. Now I think its time for the Academy to acknowledge Scorsese for his craft and technique. While some people will believe that Scorsese should have won his Oscar back in 1980 with RAGING BULL, or in 1990 with GOODFELLAS, I feel that it's time to recognize Scorsese for something! And THE AVIATOR is one film that I think that most Scorsese devotees (like myself) feel is worthy of recognition. Plus, if this movie wins both Best Director and Best Picture, then two of my favorite directors will win Oscars (Scorsese and Michael Mann, who produced AVIATOR).So that is why I am rooting and hoping that THE AVIATOR will collect Oscar gold. The best movie of the year, and don't miss it!!!!! ***** (Out of five)",10,133,229,14 December 2004
American Pie," Gross, disgusting, raunchy, perverted, and excellent.
","Gross comedies, some work (THERE SOMETHING ABOUT MARY & BASEketBALL), others don't work too well (AUSTIN POWERS 2 & SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER, & UNCUT).  AMERICAN PIE is different, it's not a movie like AUSTIN or SOUTH that relies on it's gross humor to save the muddle script.  No, instead the gross humor is a medium for a decent script that winds up working well, very well! The plot is about four high-school seniors (Jason Biggs, Chris Klein, Thomas Ian Nicholas, & Eddie Kaye Thomas) who make a pact, that they are to lose thier virginity by the time they graduate.  The idel time to 'score' is on prom night, so all four guys are working and preparing for prom night.  Oz (Chris Klein), a jock, joins the jazz choir to impress another choir member, Heather (Mena Suvari) and to show that he too can be a sensitive guy. Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas) wants to give his current girlfriend Vicky (Tara Reid) the perfect moment while having sex. Finch (Eddie Kaye Thomas), is acting very smooth and charming, trying to impress the entire senior female class with his outrageous rumors. And then there's poor Jim (Jason Biggs) a young man who is at his sexual peak, and has a crush on the foreign exchage student named Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth). From there on is a rollercoaster with the same equivalent as a Six Flags rollercoaster, of non-stop laughs and gross out jokes.  How would I compare this to other comedies as thrill rides?  AUSTIN POWERS 2 and SOUTH PARK are the scary 'kiddie' rollercoasters.   BIG DADDY is the wild, but not scary of the rollercoasters, like a medium thrill.  ANALYZE THIS and AMERICAN PIE are the monster coasters of laughs.  The ones that people wait 3 hours in line, freak out while on the ride, and want more!  Well, that is what you get after seeing AMERICAN PIE, you want more! These young actors are all going to be famous, the same way AMERICAN GRAFFITI, FAST TIMES, & DAZED & CONFUSED made most of thier stars big.  I'm sure 15 years from now, their will be a collector's edition similar to GRAFFITTI and FAST TIMES.  This is the FAST TIMES for the 90's teens, but it also appeals to the 20 something crowd, like me.  I really did enjoy seeing Chris Klein play the same type of person he played in ELECTION.  Jason Biggs was very funny as the unfortunate Jim, who is unlucky most of the time.  Tara Reid and Mena Suvari are both very good as the girls who are wondering if they are making the right decision.  But the two I thought stand-out are Shannon Elizabeth and Eddie Kaye Thomas.  Elizabeth is GORGEOUS, she will get tons of iternet hits by the end of the summer.  And Thomas is both very smooth and calm, he's very similar to a calm David Schwimmer. People are calling this the PORKYS of the summer.  It isn't PORKYS was very silly, immature, and cruel.  The guys were sex-hungry idiots, and the girls were brainless sex objects.  I would rank this film with the better comedy of 1982, FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH.  Like FAST TIMES, it's full of laughs, and it has heart.  PORKYS didn't have any heart, just cruel jokes. AMERICAN PIE will tickle the young adults funny bones the same way ANALYZE THIS tickled the adults and seniors funny bones. But this film isn't for those only under 30, I'm sure that older people will enjoy this film the same way they enjoyed THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY.  Will the pre-teens will try to sneek into SOUTH PARK or go watch AUSTIN POWERS 2.  The real men and women will be watching AMERICAN PIE, and lovin' it.  Just like I did. ***** (out of *****)",9,0,0,6 July 1999
Cast Away," The better side of Zemeckis
","We take our lives for granted.  It may be normal and ordinary for us to use the instruments of necessities.  The 21st century man and woman have molded with technology to survive.  But what if all of the daily use of equipment is taken away from you, would you survive?  With Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) he has to escape the modern technology world and survive with very little in the new film, CAST AWAY. Chuck Noland is a Fed Ex employee who has very little time, he dictates some Russians on how speed does make a difference when it comes to delivering a package.  Anc Chuck doesn't even have much time to spend the Christmas holiday with his love, Kelly Frears (Helen Hunt) since Chuck has to go overseas to help aid another Fed Ex station.  On route back to the U.S., over the south Pacific the jumbo Fed Ex cargo plane crashes killing the all of the crew and nearly killing Chuck.  Chuck then arrives on a deserted island, realizing that a man who was rushing with time, now has all the time in the world as he is isolated from civilization.  Chuck has to find ways to survive, he writes on a giant boulder with a smaller stone, he spears fishes with a sharp bamboo stick, and it is almost a miracle when he starts a fire.  With some Fed Ex boxes from the crash arriving on shore, Chuck makes the best use of them. He uses video tape for rope, a garment for a fishing net, and for companionship to keep his sanity he uses a volleyball as a head and names the ball 'Wilson.' I predicted back in July that CAST AWAY was going to be the better Robert Zemeckis film compared to WHAT LIES BENEATH (don't believe me, check out my WHAT LIES BENEATH review).  And several months later I was right, CAST AWAY was far much better than WHAT LIES.  I really enjoyed the symbolism of CAST AWAY, how can modern man survive in the wild. Zemeckis goes into much detail on how difficult it took the character of Chuck Noland to survive, with eating, shelter, and sanity. Zemeckis also shows some pretty graphic scenes on how Nick gets rid of a bad tooth. The movie is 138 minutes, and a little over a hour has Hanks alone on the island.  And to carry a movie like this, a great actor needs to do a excellent performance, and Tom Hanks does it very well!  Leave it to Tom Hanks to give another brillant performance in this film, which I feel should probably be his third Oscar win.  Along with PHILADELPHIA, FORREST GUMP, BIG, APOLLO 13, and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the role of Chuck Noland is a memorable performance in Hanks' career.  Hanks adds humor, sadness, and pain as the role of the sole survivor who goes through a adventure to survive. And what a adventure!  There are plenty of exciting scenes to keep any viewer's attention through out the entire movie.  I would like to see Kelly, Rudy, and Richard from t.v.'s 'Survivor' to have the same necessities that Chuck has in the film to survive the island for about five years. The only flaw is that there are some scenes that have the adventures similar to a thrill ride, but there are some very slow scenes here and there. But why bicker?  CAST AWAY is easily one of the best films of 2000, and another excellent film to add to the impressive list of Tom Hanks' career.  Just like FORREST GUMP, the partnership of Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks would deliver a great film, and CAST AWAY is another film that delivers.

American Psycho," Being A Serial Killer.
","Patrick Bateman is a Wall Street yuppie who has a nice apartment, nice clothes, healthy body, a beautiful girlfriend, and a great paying executive job.  However, all is not normal for Patrick, you see, beneath those high quality assests, there's a monster that lives deep in Patrick's soul.  That monster is vicious and evil, it's the evil side that controls Patrick when he's upset and angry.  And then all hell breaks loose, blood is shed, and Patrick continues with his daily life. That is the premise behind the new Mary Harron film, AMERICAN PSYCHO. Patrick (Christian Bale) A everyday man, who is indeed successful, wealthy, and part of the elite society in the late 1980's.  But he releases his anger by taking care of his problems, which would include disembody a woman's head, chop a fellow co-worker into little pieces, and other horrific things.       PSYCHO is a intelligent satire of the late 1980's, where we were serious about the lifestyle, songs, and attitude that is protrayed in the film back in 1987.  Now we just laugh and are in disbelief on the way we acted and the music we listened to.  PSYCHO shows the strong conservative image that most Americans were living during Regan's power.  But it's the brilliant inside look at what one of these conservative's would be like if we took a look inside their life.      I was really looking forward to PSYCHO, I was hoping that it would be like a look inside the mind of a madman like Hannibal Lecter, or Travis Bickle.  But it's different, it doesn't really tell the viewer why Patrick kills.  Instead, it shows Patrick's daily life-style, which includes putting on tons of different beauty oils, excersising regularly, and tanning. But it shows that the psychos in our world are not the kind that live in the dark in urban American and have special kinds of moths with a skull on it.  No, it shows that the serial killer is not only the person that you know, but your best friend! The acting by Christian Bale is outstanding, he did quite a job by dropping his Limey accent for a pure Yank accent.  I love his speeches on certain 80's music, including Hewey Lewis, Phill Collins, and Whitney Houston.  The support is also good, Willem Dafoe is also good as a investigator looking for a missing person that Patrick might have killed.  Chloe Sevigny is also very good as the Patrick's administrative assistant who has a crush on Patrick.  And Reese Witherspoon is a typical snobby and stuck-up socialite who cares more about what will the wedding look like than the actual marriage. Mary Harron does a great job adapting the horrific novel (although I haven't read it yet), but with the story and pacing, it appears that she got the real reason to why we should watch this movie.  What I also enjoyed is the trickery that Harron uses in this film.  When the viewer thinks that they are seeing something, it's something totally different.  I always love it when a film director messes with the viewer's mind. Overall, I really did enjoy AMERICAN PSYCHO, but it does have it's bad points.  At times the movie goes from a fast pace to a bit slower.  And some of the character's are not explained fully in detail.  But those are just the side dishes compare to the rest of the film. But when you have a film where you have businessmen compare business card's to show their masculinity, it's sad but funny.  It's just a cruel way to show that while others care about their appearence, others are releasing their anger and taking out on others, with their blood.  This film is not really for the faint of heart.  It's not that gross, but it does leave a lot to the imagination, which is more gross. **** (out of five)",7,0,0,17 April 2000
U-571," Das Boot- American style.
","U-571 is the horrorific tale of being trapped in a enemy u-boat during World War II.  Lt. Andrew Tyler (Matthew McConaughey) has his crew run and operate a very worn down German submarine while trying to protect a top secret enigmamachine that will decode German messages.  What's bad about being on this sub is that they are in a German sub, where they can't understand most of the things written on there.  And the sub before, is in very bad shape that it's barely holding itself together. Along with Lt. Tyler, there's Chief Klough (Harvey Keitel) a old 'sea-dog' who has been in a submarine in battle before in World War I.  Lt. Pete Emmett (Jon Bon Jovi) who has worked with Lt. Tyler and befriended him before. Lt. Hirsch (Jake Webber) who is from the government, who's main concentration on the mission is the enigma machine.  And Marine Major Coonon (David Keith) who is leading and training the men into combat by taking over the German sub with the enigma machine.  The crew is led by Capt. Dahlgren (Bill Paxton) who feels that this is a important mission, and that if they fail, the U.S. could lose the war. U-571, is quite a outstanding film from director Jonathan Mostow.  He succeeds much better than he did with his previous film, BREAKDOWN.  Is this film a historical fact tale of the second World War?  I wouldn't bet on it, but is it a suspenseful action-thriller?  You bet it is!  I haven't been this intense with a submarine movie since Wolgang Petersen's 1982 classic, DAS BOOT.  Both films have the men waiting below, as enemy battleships sit above dropping explosions onto them.  What's rather ironic is that the first couple of minutes into this film, reminded me a lot of DAS BOOT, with the German sub and the Germans speaking their native tounge. From start to finish, this movie does grab the viewers attention.  It shows why we should root for the U.S. sailors, and boo the German sailors, without giving us any cliche.  And one is so into the movie, that they too would care on what happens to these sailors throughout their mission.  I was so tense during the movie that I almost pulled off the arm rest of my seat.      The acting in the movie is good, McConaughey is good, as usual, so is Paxton, Weber, and Jovi.  But I have to give special kudos to Harvey Keitel. He is a pro at acting, and having him act along such new faces as McConaughey and Jovi, it shows that he still has his acting touch, after twenty-five years. But I will give writer and director Jonathan Mostow full credit for U-571.  He really made a intelligent and suspensful action thriller, that is not a rip-off of DAS BOOT, but more like a homage to it.  I sure he was watching DAS BOOT over and over while making this film.  Because he managed to pull off the same tension in a sub film, that Wolfgang Petersen did in his film.  Don't miss it!!  ***** (out of five)",Null,0,1,18 April 2000
American Beauty," A look at the American family of the 90's.
","AMERICAN BEAUTY is one of those rare films that is shot following a screenplay, yet the way the film was made, at times you think it was real.  It's a movie that looks at the typical American family of the 1990's, which is usually disfunctional. And it also helps the viewer find the 'hidden' beauties in life that not many people see or they're just too busy to see.      Kevin Spacey plays Lester Burnham, a employee at a advertising company who feels that his life has come to a dead-end.  Lester tells the viewer that his life is empty, and the only excitement he gets everyday is when he 'pleasures' himself while in the shower.  Annette Benning plays his wife, Carolyn Burnham, a real estate agent who wants life to be perfect, aperfect family, a perfect marriage, a perfect job, and a perfect lifestyle. Unfortunate for Carolyn, only the lifestyle is what Carolyn can do perfect, perhaps too perfect.  Thora Birch plays their teenage daughter, Jane.  Because of the father that doesn't give her attention, and the mother that wants what's good for the mother, not for herself, she's become alienated among many people at her school, except for her friend Angela (the beautiful Mena Suvari, 'Choir Chick' from AMERICAN PIE) and the 'freak' who lives next door, Ricky (Wes Bentley). Angela has the face, body, and attitude of a super-model, she also likes to brag how boys fantasize her.  Ricky on the other hand, doesn't know many people and is considered a 'freak' by his classmates since his military strict father (played by the always wonderful Chris Cooper) sent him to a mental institution for two years. It isn't until Lester sees Angela for the first time, that he finally feels alive.  He forgot how good life is, and that it should be enjoyed while it lasts.  So Lester decides to do things the way he wants to do them, which also includes quitting his job. This gets Carolyn angry, and the only pleasure she finds is having a affair with a competitor real estate agent (Peter Gallagher). Jane finds her pleasure by getting close to the boy next door, she finds out that he is actually intelligent, and has a good eye on seeing beautiful things that most overlook. AMERICAN BEAUTY isn't like any film that I have ever seen. Usually a film one have one of these characters in a movie. And usually that one character would be the most intresting person in the movie. But not AMERICAN BEAUTY, all of the characters are intresting, and they are all unique in a different way. I found AMERICAN BEAUTY to be a masterpiece when it comes to character study, these are very different and complex characters.  Yet, when it comes to describing the plot, it's just a story about different people, there really isn't much of a plot.  It isn't complex or thick, like L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, PULP FICTION, and CITIZEN KANE.  Yet that doesn't make it a bad movie, it's excellent!  It's still worth watching.  I'm guessing that people complain that many films today have character's which are just cardboard and phony.  You won't get any phonies in AMERICAN BEAUTY, all of them seem very real, which is why I found this to be one of the best films of the year! ***** (out of five)",8,0,0,16 September 1999
The Patriot," Finally a good Revolutionary War film!
","For the Fourth of July spirit, there is a film out that will show on what the rebels of the United States had to go through to gain their freedom, the film is called THE PATRIOT. When I first heard about this film, I was very skeptic. First, I heard that Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin were working on this film, I said, 'oh boy, another dud.'  I thought STARGATE was so-so, INDEPENDENCE DAY was silly, and GODZILLA was awful, so what would they do with the American Revolution?  Then I saw that mel Gibson was involved, and not since FOREVER YOUNG, have I seen a bad Mel Gibson movie, then again, I forgot about LETHAL WEAPON 4. THE PATRIOT is set in the year 1776, in South Carolina.  Benjamin Martin (Mel Gibson) a former soldier during the French/Indian War who is now a plantation owner, and a father of seven.  He is a widower, his wife passed away a few years eariler, and he spends his time doing woodwork in his barn.  It isn't until a town meeting is called that the other Americans decide on should they go into war to fight the English for their freedom or not.  Martin, doesn't want to see anymore bloodshed, he would rather see more negotiations be made, until they come to an agreement. But Martin is outvoted, but what really upsets Martin is that his eldest son, Gabriel (Heath Ledger) enlists in the military to fight the English soldiers.  Martin, being a good soul, decides to take care of all of the wounded soldiers, no matter who's side they are on.  Col. William Tavington (a very sadistic Jason Isaacs) arrives and orders the wounded redcoats to be taken to a English camp, kill the wounded rebels, arrest Gabriel and taken to camp to be hung, steal the black plantation workers who work for Martin to fight for the English, and burn down the Martin house.  Talk about villainy! Martin then decides that enough is enough, with Gabriel and a group of miliants that he leds, they set out to fight the English to gain their freedom.  But before you will yell, 'BRAVEHEART!' there are some differences in this film. First, there is Gibson's character of Martin, who would rather see the differences come to a peaceful end without raising a rifle.  And Martin goes to fight, it's not only for freedom, but for revenge.  Second, unlike William Wallace, Martin is a father, and is caring more for his family, than for the country.  And the battle scenes are different.  They are not as bloody as BRAVEHEART, or as pumped up as SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, but they do stand on it's own.  What GLORY did for the Civil War, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN did for World War II, and FULL METAL JACKET did for Vietnam, PATRIOT does for the Revolutionary War. The acting in this film is also very good.  I did enjoy Heath Ledger who plays the rebellious son who wants to fight for freedom.  And I also enjoyed Tcheky Karyo as the French officer and Tom Wilkinson as English General Cornwallis.  But the best acting credit goes to three actors. First there's Chris Cooper, a actor that I always enjoy watching.  Ever since LONE STAR, I've followed this actor's career.  From A TIME TO KILL to THE HORSE WHISPERER to OCTOBER SKY and AMERICAN BEAUTY to the recent ME, MYSELF, & IRENE, Cooper has always make a film worthwhile.  And in THE PATRIOT he gives a great performance as American Col. Harry Burwell, a fellow soldier who fought in the French/Indian War with Martin.  Then there's Jason Isaacs, the most coldest villian since Doug Hutchinson's role of 'Percy Wetmore' in THE GREEN MILE.  You'll hate Isaacs character of Col. Tavington so much that you would like to kill him yourself. And for that, I applaud his performance, like Richard in RICHARD III, he is indeed cold-hearted and cruel.  And Mel Gibson also does a very good performance of the father who cares for his children and is emotional throughout the bloody war that takes a toll on his neighbors and family. It's too bad that THE PATRIOT is very bloody, otherwise it would have been a great film to show for schools.  I know it's not historical accurate, but with the environment, the setting, and the historical characters in the film, it does give a entertaining look at the war for America's independence.  But if I was a father, I would rather take my child to THE PATRIOT than to ME, MYSELF, & IRENE, SHAFT, or THE MATRIX.  PATRIOT is just as bloody or gross as those films, but it is historical and who said that war was pretty? But all and all, I recommend THE PATRIOT for a entertaining film. Yeah, it's not factual, but it does give a good idea on how the Revolutionary War was fought.  It's rather ironic that the first director to make a good film on the American Revolution is a German.  But as for Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin, I consider this thier best work to date.  Keep up the good work guys, you're now on the right track!  ****1/2 (out of five)",Null,0,2,5 July 2000
Being John Malkovich," A creative and weird movie.
","This is a bizarre film with a bizarre story. However, it is a very creative story.  Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) gets a job at a company on the 7 1/2 floor of a office building. While organizing some files, Craig finds a door behind a filing cabnet.  Inside the door is a portal into another world, the world of another person.  Craig can experience thoughts, feelings, and see the actions of this other person.  The only thing, it that this other person is famous actor John Malkovich! However, Craig can only experince this for only 15 minutes, then he winds up on the side of the road at the New Jersey turnpike.  Craig and his sexy co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) see this door as a money profit business.  Yet, Craig has also fallen in love with Maxine, eventhough he's already married to an animal loving pet store owner, Lotte (Cameron Diaz).  From there on is a wild and twisted story that keeps going up hill until the very end. I have never seen a film quite like this one.  This seems like something that former Monty Python member Terry Gilliam would have thought of.  It's very creative, and at the same time twisted, strange, and very very funny!  I thought the idea of a building being on the 7 1/2 floor was creative, but there's a lot more creative images and settings than just that scene.  And the dialogue is also very witty!  With such lineslike 'Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climate,' is the most wittiest lines that I have heard actors give since the Marx Brothers. The acting is also very well done.  John Cusack is excellent, as usual, as the man who torn between two women, seeing the world through two people. Cameron Diaz took a big risk playing a non-glamorous role, and she still manages to pull through.  Catherine Keener is also great as the seductive co-worker who has plans of her own.  And of course, John Malkovich himself is also very enjoyable as, well, himself. But Malkovich is such a great sport, that he even allows the story to make fun of himself. Director Spike Jonze (Vig from THREE KINGS) is going to be a popular director because of this film.  He directs the film along the same simialr lines as a Terry Gilliam film: dark, bizarre, and funny.  And writer Charlie Kaufman shows a promising career with this being his first major film.  I would be very upset if this film doesn't get a Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, it deserves it!  ***** (out of five)",9,1,2,9 November 1999
Spider-Man," Another Success for Marvel Comics!
","I've always enjoyed movies that are made based on comic books.  In fact one of my earliest movie going memories was watching the original 1978 SUPERMAN with Christopher Reeve and Gene Hackman.  Then when BATMAN was released I then not only enjoyed movies more, but also comic books.  Then Hollywood decided to 'cash in' on the success of BATMAN, and release more films based on comic books (PUNISHER, CAPTIAN AMERICA, SPAWN, BLADE, etc.) But Warner Bros. was just as gulity by releasing more than enough sequals for BATMAN (they should have stopped after Tim Burton and Michael Keaton bowed out).  But now the latest craze is Marvel comics.  With the success and great quality of X-MEN two years ago, now comes the biggest and most anticipated Marvel super-hero: SPIDER-MAN! For those who never read the comic, or watch the 1970's cartoon (with the catchy song title) here is the basic story of the plot that is in the film.  Before he was a super-hero, he was a super-nerd, Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the top student and achiever at his high school.  For that he is teased and picked on by the other jealous and cruel students, but Peter has normal small dreams.  The only thing that he really wants is to win the heart of the friendly girl that he has had the biggest crush with, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  I can relate with that.  While on a field trip at the science center, Peter is bitten at his hand by one of the super-spiders that are scientific engineered.  With this bite, Peter inherits all of the powers that the super-spider has: stong web, able to jump great distance, stonger muscles, etc.  While Peter discovers his new powers, his only other friend (besides Mary Jane) Harry Osborn (James Franco) is realizing that his father, brilliant scientist and millionare Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe) is acting strange, and there are bizarre murders surrounding Norman's science company.  Norman self-tested a powerful chemical that backfired and drove Norman to become schizophrenic and also have super human strength.  With Peter and Norman's super strength, Peter becomes the friendly and brave Spider-Man, with Norman's new evil mind he becomes the dark and vicious Green Goblin. Now with these two powers in New York City, who will win? That is the premise of the plot, it's not complex, but then again which comic book into film is?  Comic books are mostly based on characters and their personalities.  But to have a successful comic film, you need to have your characters (especially your super-heroes) well developed, not paper thin.  SUPERMAN, BATMAN, and X-MEN all did this, and I'm pleased to say that SPIDER-MAN is the same. Screenwriter David Koepp does a great job developing the characters for the screen.  You understand who Peter, Mary Jane, and Norman are, and you seen that there is more of a human personality with their characters. While director Sam Raimi does a great job with the pacing of the story, keeping it entertaining and exciting.  But most of all, giving it the same type of flow that you would read in a comic-book.  And the music score by the much beloved Danny Elfman also gives it a comic-book feel.  Note: if you're going to make a comic-book into film, you must have Danny Elfman do the music score. But what I feel the strongest element with SPIDER-MAN is the romantic chemistry between Peter and Mary Jane.  I haven't seen such a romantic relationship in a comic into film since Superman and Lois Lane. Instead of just casting someone to play the damsel in distress, Kristin Dunst does a great job as Mary Jane.  While Tobey Maguire also gets kudos as the love-struck Peter who is always smitten with her, but won't reveal his secret-identity as Spider-Man (with whom Mary Jane falls in love with). And Willem Dafoe is also good as the villian Green Goblin. I think creator Stan Lee should be proud of what Sam Raimi and company did with his most popular comic character.  What I also enjoyed about SPIDER-MAN is that it has a tounge-in-cheek humor similar to the original SUPERMAN.  Who didn't laugh when Clark Kent went to the phone booth to change into Superman, to see that it's not a full booth?  The scene where Peter first reveals his super-human strength during a wrestling match has the same kind of humor. Overall, SPIDER-MAN isn't Oscar material, but it is fun, and that's it purpose.  Had SPIDER-MAN been released last summer, it would have easily been the best film of the summer, along with A.I.  Let's just hope that the rest of this summer's film will be just as good.  But I doubt it will. Very entertaining and enjoyable!  ***** (out of five)",10,0,0,14 June 2002
Collateral," Another winner from Michael Mann!
","COLLATERAL has been the movie I've been anticipating the most this past summer. Yea, movies like SPIDER-MAN 2, TERMINAL, BOURNE Supremacy, and THE VILLAGE were films that I was excited about, and was very pleased with the finish product. Then films like SHREK 2, and MANCHURIAN CANIDATE were films that I wasn't excited about, and winded up being pleasantly surprised. Yet, I was expecting a majority of the summer films to be like I-ROBOT, DAY AFTER TOMORROW, and VAN HELSING, look good, but no substance. COLLATERAL was a different story, since the least appreciated director working in Hollywood today, Michael Mann, directs it. Watching the sneak preview tonight, everybody in line was psyched up because it was the new 'Tom Cruise film.' I sat in line with my tiny Pocket Essentials copy of the filmography and career of Michael Mann. When I asked people in line if they knew who Michael Mann was, I got from everybody, 'uh, nope!' No surprise there. I've been building up my excitement for this movie the last couple of weeks by watching the previous films from Mann's career, Thief, THE KEEP, MANHUNTER, LAST OF THE MOHICIANS, THE INSIDER, ALI (director's cut), and my favorite HEAT. I also watched the episode of the directors that airs on Encore about Mann's life and career and reading my two paperback books about Michael Mann's films (no big surprised, both books were published in England). In short COLLATERAL in America will be hyped as the 'New Tom Cruise film' in Europe, it will be known as the 'New Michael Mann film.' To put it simply, I analyzed and studied what all of Mann's films have in common and what his style was, then I watched COLLATERAL. COLLATERAL has a hit man, Vincent (Tom Cruise), arriving at LAX in the late afternoon, with not really giving details at first what his objective is. A cabdriver, Max (Jamie Foxx), is shown beginning his evening shift. After Max picks up a customer, Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), he convinces her that he knows the fastest way to get around Los Angeles, and proves it to her. By having an enjoyable conversation, Annie is intrigued and interested in Max, so much that she gives him her business card, hoping to talk to him again soon. After what seems like what is going to be a great night for Max, the next customer is Vincent, who asks if Max can take Vincent to five different stops in L.A. for the evening, paying Max twice the amount for a cab driver's pay. Max doesn't see this as a problem, until while at the first stop; a body falls down on Max's taxi. It turns out that Vincent is a hit man and the five stops involves with five different people that Vincent is planning on killing. While Vincent and Max travel around L.A., with Max hesitating with what he is doing, a police detective, Fanning (Mark Ruffalo) visits the apartment where Vincent made his first kill, the man isn't there, but there's a broken window and evidence of struggle. While Vincent has Max take him around L.A. to different locations for his contract killings, Fanning is investigating on who did murder the man in the apartment. COLLATERAL similar to Mann's previous crime films, (Thief, MANHUNTER, L.A. TAKEDOWN, and HEAT) is very intelligent and clever, that is what I love about Mann's films. The criminals are smart, while the police officers are also smart (no bumbling crooks or doughnut eating cops in Mann's films). The character of Vincent shows that he is a professional with his job by the way he holds his gun (the similar way all of Mann's characters hold their guns, holding it up while aiming at the same time). While the character of Fanning shows logical motives to what could have happened to the people who were killed. This isn't a slam-bang action packed film, but then again, there isn't a Michael Mann film that is all action and no plot. HEAT and Thief gives complex characters with their motives, feelings, ambitions and personalities, while COLLATERAL does the same thing. If you pay attention to what the characters have to say in COLLATERAL (at least Vincent and Max), you will see them as people, not characters. COLLATERAL is a thinking man's thriller. The acting by Jamie Foxx is good; it's nice to see Foxx being able to give a performance that is different than the comedic roles that he has played in the past (BAIT, HELD UP, BOOTY CALL, etc.) COLLATERAL shows that Foxx can do a great job being a serious actor, and hopefully for his sake, will be seen as a serious actor. While Ruffalo, and Pinkett Smith also do good jobs with their supporting roles. But it is Tom Cruise who proves to do a fantastic job with his role as Vincent. Not since INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE has Cruise left his good guy, heroic image for a dark character, (well the same might also be said about MAGNOLIA). But Cruise shedding his handsome image shows that he really put a lot of effort into playing Vincent. The character of Vincent is for me the most enjoyable and fun villain that I've seen since Daniel Day Lewis' performance as Bill the Butcher in GANGS OF NEW YORK. A villain that shoots out fantastic lines like a Sergio Leone film. But it is Mann's directing is what really impressed me with this film. All of his trademarks are shown in this film. First the digital high definition camera work looked great! Since Mann hasn't worked with Dante Spinotti since THE INSIDER, both Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron do a great job giving COLLATERAL the Mann look, blue lighting with the various TOT (tricks of the trade) shots. I've said it before and I'll say it again, only Michael Mann can make a city like Los Angeles and make it look like a beautiful city with the cinematography. Besides the cinematography, Mann uses his other trademarks, the great soundtrack, this time it is techno music mixed with, blues, and Latin, and the characters (particularly Vincent) dressed sharp and stylish. But since Vincent is a criminal, he doesn't wear a tie, similar to Neil McCauley, DeNiro's character in HEAT. Plus Mann shoots on location in L.A., making the city more realistic, mixing office high rises with Koreatown stores and nightclubs, and old well kept apartment buildings. In my review of HEAT I praised Mann for giving the viewer an accurate look of Los Angeles. Since L.A. is my second home, Mann uses the same moves in COLLATERAL. I could go into more detail why I loved COLLATERAL, but why spoil the party? This is the best film I have seen all summer and perhaps this year (although I still love KILL BILL VOL. 2). My expectations were met and like all of Mann's other films, COLLATERAL requires multiple viewings. For people who love Michael Mann films, I would rank this film his 3rd best, behind HEAT and THE INSIDER. For people who enjoy a smart intelligent thriller, like BOURNE Supremacy, but not as much action and less jerking of the camera, then COLLATERAL should please you. But if you're looking for an action packed Jerry Bruckheimer /Michael Bay film, then watch something else. But COLLATERAL is the first film this year that can be considered worthy of an Oscar nomination or two. Great show! ***** (Out of five)",10,1,2,4 August 2004
The Exorcist," Good fighting the ultimate evil.
","**SPOILER ALERT** Two years ago, I was fortunate to see THE EXORCIST on the big screen at the Warner Bros. 75th Anniversary film festival. And watching it on the big screen made me change my opinion of the movie from weird to excellent.  I first saw EXORCIST when I was nine on late night television.  I couldn't make any sense of it, and I though it was very bizarre.  I saw it a few years later on video and thought it was so-so. But watching this on the big screen really makes a impact of the film.  And now, we are lucky to see THE EXORCIST on the big screen, and it is the uncut version. In case you never heard or saw THE EXORCIST, this is based on the popular novel by William Peter Blatty.  Blatty loosely based his story on a factual incident of a real exorcism during the 1940's.  Exorcism became a thing of the past since modern science discovered various mental illnesses including split personalities and insanity.  In the film famous film actress, Chris MacNeil (Ellen Burstyn) is noticing that day after day, her twelve year old daughter, Regan (Linda Blair) is acting more bizarre and scary.  From using constant profanities to even hitting her mother and doctors.  After going to several different doctors, Chris seeks the help from Father Karras (Jason Miller).  Father Karras is having problems of his own, he questions his own faith after being guilty over his mother's death in a mental institution.  When Father Karras discovers the horrors of the deamon that has taken over Regan's body he wishes to use a exorcism, a ancient ritual where a priest or rabbi drive the evil spirit out of a person's body.  But since Karras is inexperienced, he gets the help from the distinguished and experienced Father Merrin (Max Von Sydow).  While a police detective, Lieutenant Kinderman (Lee J. Cobb) is investigating the murder of film director Burke Dennings (Jack MacGowran). The original EXORCIST I think is one of the most frightening and scariest movies of all time.  Although it's not about a shark in water (which scares me the most) this is about a evil that lives amongst us.  Some people don't believe this, others strongly do.  This is a film that is different and better than the slasher flicks that are being released by the dozens. I am here to review the new and uncut version of the film, so here is what I enjoyed and didn't enjoy with the new version. LIKED:  I enjoyed the new digital transfer, it was excellent!  I kept jumping as I heard the voice of the demon from behind me in the theater. It's rare that I can recognize the new digital transfer with classic being rereleased and digitally transferred. I also enjoyed some of the deleted scenes that were shown.  I found the best to be the first examination of Regan, where later on the doctor reveals to Chris that her daughter was using strong profanity towards him.  Unlike the original version where the terror just jumps out, it creeps up in this version.  I also enjoyed the more visions of the demon and the nice quiet dialogue scene where Father Merrin and Karras are discussing the evil they are up against.  DISLIKED:  I did enjoy the visions of the demon, but on the windows?  And the doors?  It looks more comical that scary when I see those. Unless director William Fredkin and writer/producer William Peter Blatty can come up with a good reason on why they did that, I won't accept it. But the biggest flaw is the end,  I am one who always enjoys a director's cut, THE ABYSS, ALIENS, and even the STAR WARS films redone were fantastic. But the final scene in the film where Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer (Reverand William O'Malley) are talking about movies, takes away the errie and suspense of the original.  Where the original suddenly ended with the Jack Nitzsche 'Tublar Bells' being played then...BOOM the credits.  It ends in a terrifying and creepy note.  But with this new ending, it's almost like a 'happy ending' a ending that modern movie goers would enjoy.  I am a person that would always say, 'more is better.'  But with this version, it ruins the film. This is a movie that I would find to be very scary.  It would be a great film to watch on Halloween night.  But what upset me while watching this film are the rude people who would laugh and find this movie to be funny.  Why?  What's so funny about a young girl spitting up pea soup?  I would be horrified and disgusted.  But the people who laugh at this film, are the kind that find a stupid teenager wearing a white hollow mask carrying a knife around killing teens, to be scary.  These imbeciles are the ones who find THE SIXTH SENSE to be 'stupid' EVENT HORIZON to be 'weird' but find SCREAM as 'the bomb' and I KNOW WHAT YOU DID... as 'freaky.'  You can point the fingers at those who ruined the terror of THE EXORCIST.  I'll point my finger at the Hollywood director's who do countless rip-offs and spoofs of EXORCIST (Leslie Nielsen's REPOSSESSED and ABBY come to mind).  Also, EXORCIST, after twenty-seven years is still getting ripped off with END OF DAYS, STIGMATA, and most recently LOST SOULS.  And the violence shown on t.v. news shows and programs just to get raitings.  If I told a majority of teens that the EXORCIST has been banned in the U.K. until two years ago, they would think that I am kidding, but I'm not. Like JAWS, STAR WARS, PSYCHO, and any other modern classic movie, if a plot works, other Hollywood studios try the same thing to cash in on the popularity.  By doing this, it causes the film's impact to die, and become cliched.  I can see THE MATRIX, SIXTH SENSE, and AMERICAN BEAUTY to be the next set of films with countless rip-offs.  It's a shame, what did really kill THE EXORCIST, why Hollywood, of course! But anyways, this is a film that is a must see!  See it on the big screen instead of blowing 3 bucks at the video store to think it's cheeper. That's like going to your swimming pool to go fishing, since it's closer and cheeper. Just go see this in the theater, and Halloween night would be the perfect night! 1973 VERSION: *****    2000 VERSION: ****1/2 (out of five)",10,1,3,16 October 2000
Ocean's Eleven," E-O-Eleven.
","I watched the original OCEAN'S 11 about six years ago when I was in my Las Vegas kick.  I enjoyed the plot of eleven men trying to rob five casino's (Flamingo, Sands, Desert Inn, Rivera, and Sahara) at the same time on New Year's Eve.  The problem is that the movie took about an hour to get started talking about the heist and once it was done it was like, ho-hum. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the movie more the more times I watched it, but seeing Ol' Blue Eyes, Dean, Sammy, Peter, and Pal Joey pulling pranks on the Russian boss who is put together the heist and and playing pranks on each other, it reminded me of party crashing someone's party, or watching a party that happened eons ago.  I thought that a remake of OCEAN'S 11 would be a great movie, if it is done in a caper-heist style.  Steve Soddenberg thought so also, and now his latest film is the remake of OCEAN'S 11. Instead of a modern 'Rat Pack' Soddenberg casted well played actors for his version.  Replacing 'One Take Frank' is George Clooney as Danny Ocean. That is a perfect casting choice, I can't think of another actor out there who is super-cooler than Clooney.  Ocean is just released from a minimum New Jersey State Prison after serving five years.  He immediately violates parole by seeing his old partner Dusty Ryan (Brad Pitt) in Hollywood.  Danny suggests to Dusty to not rob one but three casinos in Las Vegas (Belliago, Mirage, & MGM Grand), the three biggest money making casinos all owned by Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia).  Danny wants to get revenge on Terry because Terry is engaged to Danny's ex-wife, Tess (Julia Roberts) which Danny is still in love with, and Danny wants to win Tess back.  Danny and Dusty put together a team fianced by Ruben Tishkoff (Elliot Gould) a former casino manager, who's casino was bought out by Benedict to have it be demolished in a ground-breaking ceremony.  The team includes Danny, Dusty, Ruben, Frank (Bernie Mac) a blackjack dealer, Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle) a demolitions expert, Virgil and Turk Malloy (Casey Affleck & Scott Cann) two screwball mechanics, Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner) a gambler, a electronics expert (Edward Jenison), a carnival trapeeze artist (Shaobo Quin), and Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon) a master pickpocket.  Together these 11 men try to pull off a heist that has never been done in Las Vegas, up against a man who will not only ruin the lives of those trying to rob him, but also the lives of the would-be robber's family. OCEAN'S 11 is a film that Soddenberg made only for 'entertainment purposes.'  OCEAN'S does pull something off that has never been done in Hollywood in a long time: IT'S BETTER THAN THE ORIGINAL!!!!  This movie is fast, funny, exciting, and entertaining all at the same time.  I just watched the original OCEAN'S 11 again last week, I think it will be a while before I can sit down and watch the Rat Pack again.  This version I have already seen twice and plan on seeing it again!      Soddenberg chops out all the slow romance borning parts of the original, and the sub-plot involving Ceaser Romero and makes this version very enjoyable.  I was amazed that Soddenberg got permission to shoot this movie inside the Belliago casino, since it is the target of getting robbed in the film. The shots of Las Vegas are beautiful (like Dean Martin sang in 'Ain't That A Kick In the Head.')  There is one shot in the movie of a Las Vegas blackout that blew my mind away, how many of you could imagine a complete blackout in Las Vegas?      The acting and dialogue between the actors is another major standout. Lines like, Ocean: 'Does he (Terry) make you laugh?'  Tess: 'He doesn't make me cry the way I use to.'  Ouch!  Sharp dialogue even from the heroine, that is very rare.  The dialogue between the 11 guys, Tess, and Terry are all enjoyable, it's the kind of dialogue that made PULP FICTION and JERRY MAGUIRE well liked and famous movies that are still being quoted today. Clooney and Pitt do stand out with their acting from the crew, but Gould and Reiner also do impressive jobs also stealing the show from Clooney and Pitt that it shows that old dogs still have what it takes to run the show.      Is OCEAN'S 11 the best movie of the year?  No, is it the most entertaining?  You betcha!  This is the kind of popcorn movie that I enjoy: big stars, flashy locations, sharp dialogue, and wonderful plot twists.  Now I think Michael Bay, Simon West, Jan De Bont, and Stephen Sommers need to all sit down and watch this movie.  That way they can get an idea on how to make a big budget entertaining film that works, and not fizzles (i.e. TOMB RAIDER, MUMMY RETURNS, THE HAUNTING, etc.)  Classic film, no, enjoyable and watchable more than once? definitly! ***** (out of five)",Null,0,1,8 December 2001
Pearl Harbor," Top Titanic
","It's obvious that when Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay heard about the record breaking gross for TITANIC, they put heads together and said, 'let's make our own 20th century tragic disaster film.'  Thus in early 1998 Bruckheimer and Bay announced the planning on making the film PEARL HARBOR. The original cast included Cameron Diaz and Gene Hackman, but through time the actors became Kate Beckinsdale and Jon Voight.  But it would be expected that there would be big explosions and special effects for this film.  And this film does have big explosions and special effects. But first let's get to the plot (which some would critize that there really isn't one).  Ben Affleck plays Kentucky native Rafe McCawley (with a bad Southern accent) and Josh Hartnett is his long time best friend Danny Walker.  Rafe falls in love with volunteer nurse Evelyn Johnson (the ravishing beautiful Kate Beckinsdale), and Rafe tells Evelyn that he is going over to England to help the English fight against the Nazi's, since this is in early 1941.  Rafe's plane is hit while flying causing his plane to crash and Danny and Evelyn to think he's dead.  So to put the past behind, Evelyn falls in love with Danny, and realizes that Danny is more 'fun' to be with.  Then Rafe comes back stateside and shocks both Danny and Evelyn, and did I forget to mention that this is in Hawaii and it's December 6th 1941?  Anyways, just when Rafe and Danny's friendship is about to come to a end, dozens of Japanesse airplanes fly into Hawaii and begin attacking Pearl Harbor, thus making it a frighting and unforgettable scenes to watch.There is good news and bad news about this film.  The good news, the attack of Pearl Harbor is frighting, spectacular, exciting, and unforgettable.  The bad news, in this 3 hour plus film, it takes 90 minutes for the film to get to the attack.  So it's another obvious factor, Bay is trying to pull the romantic factor from TITANIC to make the character's three dimensional.  But there's a difference, Leonardo DiCapprio and Kate Winslet had chemistry, Affleck, Beckinsdale and Hartnett don't.  That makes the first nintey minutes of PEARL HARBOR very very s-l-o-w and unintresting. You just want everyone to die just so it can get to the attack, since the characters are so cliche.  And the supporting characters are no better for both the men (the guy who tries to get a girl in bed, the one who stutters, the one who wonders why can't he get a girl) and the women (the flirt, the brain, the obese one, etc.)  Then the film shows scenes of airplane flying in the clouds during a sunset that looks like something from Bruckheimer's other flying film, TOP GUN (which also was another boring romance film). I was just waiting to hear Berlin's 'Take My Breath Away' being played in the soundtrack. Then it happens.  The attack.  The Japanesse planes fly in looking like something from one of the STAR WARS films.  They fly over a valley, over a woman hanging clothes on a line, and by a baseball field where kids are playing a early morning game.  The first torpedo is dropped, as the sailors wonder was is heading towards them, and BOOM!!! All hell breaks loose.  For the next seventy minutes is very horrific scenes of sailors getting shot, blown up, or even drowned.  This is when the movie works, it's just as intense as the sinking of TITANIC and just has frighting as the attack of Normady in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. The film's pacing went from 10 mph to 100 mph!!!  Then, the attack is over and the film drops back to 15 mph, brining the sappy love story back into the spotlight, and making the audience groan. I did enjoy the acts of PEARL HARBOR II and III, but part I should have been cut, massively.  Bay figured that people want a three hour romantic epic, and yes we do, but we also want intresting characters!! I really didn't care much of the acting by the actors who played fictional characters (but Kate Beckinsdale was so pretty to look at that I would rather be with her and die at Pearl Harbor than to be on the sinking Titanic with Kate Wislet).  It's the actors who play the factual characters that are good: Cuba Gooding Jr. playing Dorie Miller, a colored sailor who fought back at the Japanesse during the attack; Jon Voight as the respectable President Roosevelt who will not let America fall down to the Japanesse; and Alec Baldwin as the crusty and brave Col. Doolittle who led the defense attack at Tokyo because of Pearl Harbor. I did also highly enjoy the score by Academy winner Hans Zimmer.  The score to this film is more romantic and whimiscal, unlike his dramatic scores like from THE ROCK, CRIMSON TIDE, and GLADIATOR, so it was a very nice different change.  And Randall Wallace does succeed and fail with the script, he succeeds during and after the attack, he fails during the first 90 minutes. But compared to the other summer films (MUMMY RETURNS, SHREK, and KNIGHT'S TALE) PEARL HARBOR is the best summer film, so far.  I know it's not saying much since so far this is a very disappointing summer, but I did enjoy it more than the others.  It's not a classic that Touchstone Pictures is pushing it to be, and it's no TITANIC that Bruckheimer and Bay are trying to make it be.  But it is entertaining and enjoyable, and is worth watching. But Michael Bay must remember this old saying, 'less is better' and for this film, that would have made this film better.  **** (out of five)",Null,0,0,30 May 2001
Remember the Titans," TOUCHDOWN!!!!!
","By looking at REMEMBER THE TITANS you are probably saying 'oh geeze, another football movie.  How can this one be any better than the last one?  The only good recent football film is RUDY.'  Well, after seeing this film, you'll be taken by surprise, just like I was.In 1971, in Alexandria, Virginia, the town's high school football team, the T.C. Williams Titans, are very popular.  T.C. Williams High School current football coach, Coach Yoast (Will Patton), is nominated for high school Hall of Fame.  But a few weeks before the start of the school year, a white store owner shoots and kills a black man who was suspected in stealing a product.  This causes a racial seperation between blacks and whites in Alexandria.  Then just before the start of the football season, Coach Yoast gets demoted to Assistant Coach in place of Coach Boone (Denzel Washington). What's bad is that Boone is black, and Yoast is white.  Most of the town's residents are angry, and even some of the players are willing to ruin their football career's to quit the team to make a statement.  But at the start of football camp, Coach Boone won't take any racial diversity.  Boone treats all of his players equally, he has his football camp practices appear to be a mixture between boot camp and group sessions.  If the player misses catching a football, he has to run a mile.  If the player doesn't know anything about the person of the opposite color that they are rooming with, they have homework to get to know one another.  With this, it creates a special bond between these men.  Men who act more mature and humane, unlike most of the residents of Alexandria.  But when Coach Boone and Coach Yoast prove that the Titans are a winning team, the issue of race is erased and the true meaning of teamwork is born.The way to make a great sports movie is to have it be adapted from a true life story.  Like PRIDE OF THE YANKEES, HOOSIERS, and RUDY, all are films that show that what appears to be a sport, is the true triumph of the human spirit.  I really did enjoy the characters in the film, since they are factual, they have very humanistic qualities.  While one loves to hum 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough,' another gets excited while listening to 'Act Naturally.'  And although you can guess what happens in the end, you don't care.  You enjoy and like the character's so much that you are cheering for them.I highly enjoyed the acting in this film.  I think if Denzel Washington should get his long overdue Oscar for Best Actor, it should be for this film.  He teaches his team that black or white, these men are a team, and that the only way to win is teamwork.  Washington gives a bravura performance, that it will stun the people who think that Washington usually plays 'racist' roles.  I also enjoyed Will Patton a lot, he's not playing the cliche coach who gets demoted, and wants to ruin the new head coach. Instead, he understands the message that Boone is giving to the team that he helps as much as he can to help the team succeed.  I thought Patton's role is the best assistant coach role that I have seen since Dennis Hopper's role in HOOSERS.  And the football players are also great, the ones I thought stood out were:  Preston Brant (Jerry Buck, the team's captain), Donald Adensun (Petey, the team's running-back), Kip Perdue (Sunshine, the team's quarterback), Craig Kirkwood (Rev, the team's defense player), and Ethan Suplee (Lastik, the team's leading defense, and by his size, he should be!)  I was glad to see Suplee change his roles in his career.  The last time I remember seeing him, he was the vicious skinhead along with Edward Norton and Patrick Furlong in AMERICAN HISTORY X.  In REMEMBER THE TITANS, he's the exact opposite, he's the first white player who makes friends with the black players!!!Director Boaz Yakin and producer Jerry Bruckheimer should be commended for this film.I am pleased to see Jerry Bruckheimer made a really enjoyable and intellectual film, which is the complete opposite of the type of films that he's famous for.  In fact I think this is the first one intellectual film Bruckheimer has made! The message that it sends out is really powerful, and if it doesn't convince you to change, then you are probably dead.  And director Boaz Yakin does a fantastic job with this film, that along with Cameron Crowe, Wolfgang Petersen, and Ridley Scott, he should be nominated best director.This is quite a film, in fact, I think this is the best football movie that I have ever seen!  I really really enjoyed this film, and as I left it led me to believe in the message that this film was sending to it's audience. And this being only 'PG' and put out by Walt Disney Pictures, I would love to see both junior high schools and high schools to show this film to it's students.  If they did, then chances are, the violence in schools will go down.  And it took Jerry Bruckheimer, Boaz Yakin, and Walt Disney Pictures to do it.  Great job guys!  Don't miss this enjoyable film! ***** (out of five)",Null,95,112,29 September 2000
Man on the Moon," A somber tale about a underrated entertainer.
","I'm right now sitting at my computer with a mini t.v. right next to me.  There's a rerun episode of TAXI on right now, and it's featuring Andy Kaufman performing the character of Laka Graves.  Just after watching MAN ON THE MOON, and comparing it to the real Andy Kaufman, there are little differences and more similarities.  The film really shows on what was going on with the mind of a man that many people loved, and just as many people hated.  Andy Kaufman (for those who don't know), was a famous entertainer who usually shocked people with his unpredictable actions.  From wrestling women in the ring, to performing the rude Tony Clifton on stage, Kaufman always played his audience, and no one, not even Kaufman's closest friends and family members knew what to expect.  Kaufman is probably best known for his role of Laka Fraves on the sitcom TAXI.  But Kaufman wouldn't like that, Kaufman would like to be known as a entertainer, and this shows that.  I would say that Jim Carrey plays Andy Kaufman, but I won't.  I was very impressed and pleased with Carrey in this film that I'll say Jim Carrey is Andy Kaufman.  I've watched Andy Kaufman since I was four years old, and not only myself, but my entire family has always enjoyed his work.  I just consider it for the extremely intelligent.  Kaufman is shown his real thoughts and feelings as he stages some of his most controversial moves in his career.  Some of those bits include his dead-on imitation of Elvis, and his fight on the t.v. show FRIDAYS. I could also say that this is Jim Carrey's movie, but it isn't.  Milos Forman has always felt sympathetic towards individuals who cuased trouble in society.  From Randal MacMurphy in ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST, to Wolfgang Mozart in AMADUES, to Larry Flynt in PEOPLE VS. LARRY FLYNT. In MAN ON THE MOON, Forman shows at first how much of a rude and cruel guy Kaufman can appear to be at first, then you realize, it's all a act. Kaufman just likes to really fool people, to where they don't know that if it's a act or not.  And Forman is the perfect director to make a movie about a troublemaker in society.  The supporting acting in this film is also great. Danny DeVito is good as Kaufman's agent, George Shaprio, and so is Paul Giamatti as Kaufman's clase friend Bob Zmuda.  It's also a treat to see some of the original cast members of the show TAXI, yet they have aged quite a bit.  But what's great is seeing character actor, Vincent Schiavelli who plays a ABC executive in this film.  Schiavelli originally appeared on the show TAXI, as playing the priest who married Kaufman's character to Carol Kane's character.  It's also great to see the real Bob Zmuda, and Lorne Michaels make appearances in the film as well.  It goes to show that if all of these people are appearing in a film about a man who appears to be rude, but really isn't.  From the beginning of the film, the viewer sees a young Andy performing to a wall, then to his younger sister. And that is all Andy ever wanted is a audience.  And hopefully with this film, even 15 years after his death, his audience would have grown. This is a excellent, very funny, and very sad tale that people shouldn't miss.  It might help explain the attitude of the eccentric person that you know.  ***** (out of five)",Null,0,1,1 December 1999
Coyote Ugly," Babe-O-Rama.
","COYOTE UGLY is a nice romantic/drama/comedy that is uplifting and delightful.  It brings hope that no matter where you come from in the U.S. you can always make it in the big bad city. Except that I've already seen almost every John Cusack and John Hughes film, so it becomes routine and cliche.  If you haven't seen those films, which chances are you have, since they are in color, then COYOTE UGLY is nothing new. Every movie were a girl from a small town goes to a big city, either New York City or Los Angeles.  This time it's New York, but the main star, Violet (Piper Perabo) wants to become a songwriter, but she needs to pay for rent and other necessities (my guess is make-up).  So she goes from recording studio to studio dropping off her tapes for recording agents can listen to, but then that crummy copyright law gets in the way, damn lawyers. So what is Violet to do but to work in a evening hot spot bar called Coyote Ugly.  The bar is owned by Lil (Maria Bello) a energetic boss/bartender who is concerned about making money and not breaking the law.  There are other bartender's as well, Cammie (Izabella Miko) a sweet and kind bartender who usually melts men's hearts with her dancing.  Rachel (Bridget Moynahan) a tough as nails woman who releases her agression on the male customers.  And Zoe (Tyra Banks) a bartender who's on her way out to go to law school.  And what the women do at the bar is like a mixture of SHOWGIRLS and COCKTAIL.  They dance very erotic while pouring drinks, (hey, why can't every city have a bar like these?)  And the girls bring in lots of money nightly, mega bucks amount. While Violet is learning the ropes at the bar, and saving her money, she builds up a romance with a man who has multiple jobs, Kevin (Adam Garcia). And Violet communicates with her worried some father (John Goodman) who takes money at a toll booth. One thing that ran through my mind with COYOTE UGLY is that it is the most erotic and sexiest pronography where everyone keeps thier clothes on. The way these women dance, it comes close to a strip club dance than anything else.  The other thing that ran through my mind is the plot.  I kept guessing on what was going to happen, and I was right.  It's a romantic routine film, girl meets boy, they fall in love, they fight, they make-up, etc. What did I like about this movie?  Well, first there are the women, they are attractive and very beautiful.  Also each girl has a flame of talent that is begging to get out, however director David McNally sticks with the routine and shows too little of the girls at the bar and more with just Violet trying to succeed.  Then there's the two charming men, Adam Garcia and John Goodman.  Garcia is enjoyable as the romantic male, he is funny and charming at times, but he's also hammy and cheesy. And speaking of food, John Goodman is also funny as the father of Violet who refuses to diet and to watch over his little girl. But it's that darn bloody script that ruins everything.  It's a script that could be shown in a screenwriting class, in fact I think they have shown it in my class.  The typical rags from riches story, just with five women shaking their stuff while serving alcohol, man's two favorite things. When I talked to producer Jerry Bruckheimer last March about COYOTE UGLY, he told me that, 'there are going to be A LOT of hot looking women in it.'  And guess what?  HE'S RIGHT!!  There are a lot of hot looking women in this film, sadly they have nowhere to go.  This is similar to Bruckheimer's last drama, FLASHDANCE.  I think Bruckheimer should stick with action films, he's much better with those. *** (out of five)",5,1,1,11 August 2000
Rules of Engagement," Honorable Mention.
","I'm glad to see Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson star in a film like RULES OF ENGAGEMENT.  Because I was beginning to worry, after such duds like DEEP BLUE SEA and DOUBLE JEPORADY, I was wondering if Jones and Jackson were losing their touch with good movies.  But not only Jones and Jackson are back in good form, but so is director William Friedkin, who can place this film on his sucessful list along side with THE FRENCH CONNECTION and THE EXORCIST. RULES starts with two Vietnam soldiers, Hayes Hodges (Tommy Lee Jones) and Terry Childers (Samuel L. Jackson).  They split up thier platoon, only to have Childers capture the Viet Cong colonel and the radio operator, while Hodges gets shot and his men killed.  Childers makes a very horrifying and scary move towards the Viet Cong colonel to call the Viet Cong men off of shooting at Hodges.  The colonel agrees, and Childers saves Hodges' life.  Twenty-eight years later, Hodges and Childers are now both colonels themselves in the Marines.  Hodges is about to retire, until Childers gets himself in a terrible situation.  Childers was rescuing the ambassador of Yemen (Ben Kingsley) and his wife (Anne Archer) and child. But while in Yemen, the crowd was rioting and there were snipers shooting at the Marines and Col. Childers.  Childers orders his men to shoot at the crowd, and the press publicizes it around the world.  The U.S. government, especially the Secertary of Defense, William Sokal (Bruce Greenwood) want to point the blame on Childers, and are willing to take him to trial and court-martial him.  They recruit a young and intelligent Major Mark Biggs (Guy Pearce), to proscute Childers.  While Childers gets the some what law student Hodges to defend him in trial. RULES is like a typical court room thriller.  While I was watching this film, it reminded me of such films as A FEW GOOD MEN, A TIME TO KILL, and even TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD.  But it did matain suspense and intrest, so I did enjoy it.  Friedkin even has the viewer saying to themselves while watching this film, what would you do in Childers' situation? The acting by both Jones and Jackson are very well done. Jones has his Sam Gerrard of the FUGITIVE scarcasim, but he has a sensitive and hurt side, which I haven't seen in him before.  And Jackson is a mixutre of his roles in A TIME TO KILL, and THE NEGOTIATOR, where you're wondering if this is a man or a monster.  And supporting roles from Guy Pearce, Ben Kingsley, and Bruce Greenwood (the slimy husand in DOUBLE JEPORADY), are all good as well. But the credit should go to William Friedkin, who does a great job of keeping the pacing good, the acting great, and the story believable. After such duds like JADE, Friedkin takes a good story and makes it memorable. There are some scenes in RULES that will have scenes stick in viewers minds for weeks. It is at times bloody, but it is combat, and nobody said that combat was pretty. RULES was a good movie, and fairly enjoable.  It's not the best courtroom thriller, it's not the best Jones and Jackson film, but it is a movie the works well from start to finish.  Being that it's the pre-summer season, RULES is a good and entertaining film that will please those action hungry movie fans until GLADITATOR and MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2 are released. Until then, this film is worth seeing!  ****1/2 (out of five)",Null,0,1,10 April 2000
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The best, if not, the most entertaining film of 2003!
","<POSSIBLE SPOILERS> Oooh baby!  I've been a fan of Quentin Tarantino since I first saw RESIVOR DOGS over ten years ago.  In my Intro. to Cinema class I took my freshman year at college, in the fall of '94, I did a report on RESIVOR DOGS. When I was asked by my classmates on what film I was doing my report on, I replied RESIVOR DOGS, directed by Quentin Tarantino.  I got a blank and expressionless reaction after saying that, with a response of 'who's he?' I had to answer, 'he's the man who wrote NATURAL BORN KILLERS,' to get a full response from the classmate. Then two months later to my pleasure and enjoyment, Quentin Tarantino became a household name, and PULP FICTION would change cinema history. Then to my displeasure, EVERYBODY loved PULP FICTION.  People would dress up like the characters, quote the movie, even explain philosophical sub-text of the movie. The film attracted the same people who thought Ferris Buller was a 'righteous dude': sportos, motorheads, geeks, sluts, bloods, waistoids, dweebies, etc. In the later part of 1994 until 1996, a cinema geek couldn't go anywhere without hearing the name Quentin Tarantino. Tarantino surprised everybody with his follow-up to PULP FICTION with JACKIE BROWN, a well done and intelligent homage to the blaxploitation film of the 1970's.  A majority of the people that were attracted to Tarantino from PULP FICTION (like the people associated with Ferris Buller) felt Tarantino didn't have what it took to make a entertaining movie.  But JACKIE BROWN did deliver a great story with detailed characters and great dialogue. It was just a film that needed to be seen more than once to enjoy.  Years later rumors and spectulation began to arise on Tarantino's whereabouts. Causing a mystery surrounding a man who was claimed to be the man who 'talked too much.' Now, 2003, six years later, Tarantino returns with his 4th film, KILL BILL, and for those who felt Tarantino 'lost his touch' will be reborn again, and for those like me, who always enjoyed all of Tarantino's films, will have their expectations surpassed with this film. The plot for KILL BILL Vol. 1 is very simple, it's a revenge story. However, since Tarantino directs the film, it's not important on what the story is about, but how the story is told.  Look at RESIVOR DOGS and PULP FICTION.  Both films have stories that are pretty simple, a diamond hiest gone wrong, and two men delivering a briefcase to their boss.  But seeing the way the storyteller tells those stories is what makes Tarantino a brilliant director. The story is about The Bride (AKA Black Mamba; Uma Thurman) is shot and left for dead on her wedding day.  The Bride was attacked by the team she use to work for The Deadly Vemon Viper Squad: O-Ren Ishii/Cottonmouth (Lucy Liu); Vernita Green/Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox); Budd/Sidewinder (Michael Madsen); Elle Driver/California Mountain Snake (Daryl Hannah); and their leader, Bill (David Carradine).  Four years later, the bride comes out of her coma and immediately seeks revenge on the people that tried to kill her. But, since this is a Tarantino film there is his usual style of filmmaking including: fantastic shots, complex characters, great dialogue and monologues, a groovy soundtrack, wonderful settings, and even a style of its own. The characters are explained their background in detail as well. However, with BILL the actors then display impressive and amazing acrobatic movement as they fight. Tarantino even does a Jean Luc-Godard approach by manipulating the audience with having total control of the film and even the viewers.  Such a case is by having the dialogue of the Bride character name 'Bleep' out when characters speak it.  It similar to the 'what's in the briefcase' theory of PULP FICTION, it's left up to the viewers opinion.  Then there is the tast of retro-feel with the beginning title have the 'Shaw Scope' and the 70's style music and title card with the words 'Our Feature Presentation' appear. And like a Tarantino film, watching the film a second time around, one could pick up on things that they missed. (i.e. CHAPTER ONE- 2 <the number 2 is circled>). There is the flashy and stylish scenes, such as when O-Ren Ishii and her crew, Sofie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), Go Go Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), and others as they arrive at 'The House of the Blue Leaves.'  With the people moving in slow-motion to the cool beat of Tomoyasu Hotei's 'Battle Without Honor of Humanity,' then Tarantino giving the film a great tracking shot following the character's around the club. Should I not forget the fight scenes?  Which I say make THE MARTIX RELOADED look pale in comparision (since the MATRIX resorted to being a philosophy movie instead of action) and even surpasses the upcoming LAST SAMUARI with Tom Cruise (yes, I've already seen that film and KILL BILL's fight scenes are more impressive).  And why shouldn't they be, it was advised by the legendary Woo-ping Yuen who also did all three MATRIX films and CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON.  Yet, while the Wachowski focused on the complex meaning and mystery of what the Matrix is, and give less action, Tarantino gives more action and having the viewer decide the meaning, which makes the film more meaningful andenjoyable. Don't get me wrong, I highly enjoy MATRIX and MATRIX RELOADED, but the action in those films are not as impressive as KILL BILL. Then there is the discussion of blood, is there a lot?  Well, the blood ratio in this film makes PULP FICTION look like a PG13 film, and no I'm not kidding.  There is blood in this film, a lot of blood.  Then Tarantino hints to the audience that the blood factor shouldn't be taken seriously, such as a decapitation with blood shooting out like a fountain.  That obviously could never happen, we know that and Tarantino knows it, and makes that point clearly with this film.  Tarantino even makes it more clear about the violence by having a Japanesse animatied sequence showing massive blood and violence.  Yet to inform the audience that it shouldn't be taken seriously. I haven't been excited watching a movie the second time around more than the first time since last years GANGS OF NEW YORK.  This was one fantastic and highly entertaining film.  It's a point that most Hollywood and studio filmmakers should acknowlege when it comes to filmmaking.  It's not important on what the story is about, but how you tell the story. Tarantino believes in that statement and it shows with KILL BILL.  My only complaint is that I could have easily watched another 100 minutes or so of this film being how entertaining it is.  I will say this and stand by this comment.  I think KILL BILL would be more entertaining as a whole than watching any one of the LORD OF THE RINGS films. Which isn't really a fair statement to make, but as for pacing and enjoyment, it is a true statement.It's a shame that Tarantino doesn't release Vol. 2 by December 31st, since the quality and satisfaction Vol. 1 shows, it could have easily been a contender for this years Oscars.  I might be dreaming and off in la-la land thinking of that statement, KILL BILL nominated for Best Picture, since there is a lot of violence (the Academy ignored the modern masterpiece CITY OF GOD).  But hey, PULP FICTION was nominated for Best Picture.  With the exception of SEABISCUIT, LOST IN TRANSLATION, RETURN OF THE KING, FINDING NEMO, MYSTIC RIVER and maybe LAST SAMUARI and MASTER AND COMMAND, is there any other film that should be nominated for Best Picture?  Until then, if KILL BILL gets any awards or not, there will be a following for it for the next couple of years, making the PULP FICTION following becomming a thing of the past.  ***** (out of five)",10,0,1,21 October 2003
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo's Impossible Mission.
","This is unlike the original MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE, since both films are directed by two different directors.  For the original, Brian De Palma added action with suspense which was a good formula for bringing the t.v. series to the big screen. Now Asian director John Woo brings action with explosion for the continuing story of special agent Ethan Hunt. Tom Cruise returns as Impossible Mission Force agent Ethan Hunt, who's new mission involves retreving a deadly disease which was stolen from another IMF agent, Sean Ambrose (Dougray Scott).  Ambrose is selling the disease to the highest bidder, otherwise, he'll release the disease on the planet causing a very deadly and gruesome results. The only way that Hunt can find Ambrose is through Ambrose's former love, Nyah Nordoff-Hall (Thandie Newton).  This takes the two over to Sydney, Australia where Hunt recruits two more IMF agents, including Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) who assisted Ethan in the original film. MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE 2 is like watching John Woo's greatest hits. There are scenes and action scenes that remind me of Woo's other movies.  There are scenes that are similar from some other Woo films, like: FACE/OFF, THE KILLER, HARD BOILED, HARD TARGET, A BETTER TOMORROW, and BROKEN ARROW.  From the countless amount of slow motion action scenes, to the flying doves, there is Woo's signiture throughout this film.  Which is a lot more different than the De Palma masterpiece that we are all use to. But I still did enjoy the sequal to the 1996 film.  However, I didn't enjoy it as much as the original.  The original film was much more faithful to the television show with the super spy, government involved, and super gadgets that were like a American version of a James Bond film.  Part two, is more like FACE/OFF, where these people are authority figures, but they seem to know more kung-fu than using gadgets.  Perhaps that is what Ethan Hunt has been doing the past four years, learning kung-fu. The acting is so-so, I mean, it's no where as spectacular as the Travolta/Cage roles in FACE/OFF, or the Chow Young Fat role in THE KILLER.  Cruise is playing the same role that he plays in all of his action films, nothing special like his two previous films, MAGNOLIA and EYES WIDE SHUT.  While Dougray Scott is decent playing the villian. Overall, I didn't enjoy MI: 2, as much as the original, but it is enjoyable.  The action scenes are entertaining, but not suspenseful.  If Mr. Woo only watched some more Hitchcock or De Palma films before making MI: 2, he would have succeeded in bringing tension and suspense to the film.  But is it the biggest movie of the summer?  Na, I would say the biggest film this summer might be the one with mutants turned superheroes. **** (out of five)",Null,0,0,26 May 2000
Black Hawk Down," A different kind of war.
","Ridley Scott's BLACK HAWK DOWN is a very unique war film that has appeared on the cinema screen.  First of all it's based on a true incident in which U.S. troops were attacked in the country of Somalia.  But it wasn't a deceleration of war, it was a operation where troops were to aid the citizens of Somalia by giving them food, food that isn't taken by cruel dictator Aidid who is starving hundreds of thousands of Somlaians to death in order to gain power.  It was an operation, a operation that didn't get as much news publicity back when it did in 1993.      The story of BLACK HAWK DOWN is about the operation in Somalia when U.S. troops were to aid the United Nations by feeding and aiding the crippling citizens of Somalia from the hands of the warlord Aidid.  However, when the U.S. troops were to apprehend Aidid, Aidid's troops began attacking on the U.S. soldiers, causing two black hawk helicopter's to crash and to have U.S. troops get involved in the longest ground battle since the Vietnam War.  What makes the story more sad about the mission is that after the helicopters crashed, the mission changed from a arrest of criminal, to a rescue and escape mission.  The troops were all young men, some as young as 18 years old, others were very military experienced, but none were as experienced at the conflict on what they were about to go through. Before watching BLACK HAWK DOWN, I didn't want to raise my expectations.  It's been getting high critical praise and reviews from around the globe on how much of a excellent of a film it is.  I instead watched BLACK HAWK DOWN with an open mind.  I wanted to wait and see for myself and see if it is really a great movie.  And I was also wondering on how can anybody achieve a fantastic war film, when we were given perhaps the best war film of all time only three years ago with Steven Spielberg's SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.  Well, I am pleased to say that the film does deserve all the praise and business that it's been getting because it is indeed a brilliant piece of work. Ridley Scott makes BLACK HAWK DOWN with it's own unique style for a war film.  First of all it was a mission, not a war, and it didn't take place forty to sixty years ago, it was only nine years.  And thousands of U.S. troops didn't die only nineteen died.  Yet Scott manages to still deliver a solid war film that makes us think differently then next time U.S. troops go on another mission.  Scott makes every bullet a U.S. soldier gets hit with very effective.  Similar to THREE KINGS, every bullet pretty much counts in this film. Scott makes the viewer go through the experience of October 1993 with the soldiers on the screen, from the before the mission begins, to the battles on the soldiers trying to stay alive.  At times it looks and feels like a documentary, that this is all real.  And what Scott also does great is that he doesn't shy away from the violence of the film.  This is a very bloody and violent film.  And what makes it even more disturbing is that you see some of the soldiers get hit and blood is pouring out all over them, yet they are still alive and screaming in pain.  It's disturbing images like that, which will hopefully give the public second thoughts when it comes to the U.S. taking on operations like Somalia. The acting in the film is also very well done.  Sam Shepard as Major General William Garrison, gives the best performance in the film.  You can see that General Garrison is worried and upset on what this mission has become, you also see the change on his face from brave to fear since the mission took disastrous u-turn.  Sam Shepard always gives a great performance in every film that he appears in, but this is Shepard's best role since Chuck Yeager in RIGHT STUFF.  Other good performances go to Josh Harnett (as the young Staff Sgt. Matt Eversmann), Ewan McGregor (as the combat rookie Company Clerk John Grimes), Tom Sizemore, Eric Bana, William Fichtner, and Jason Issacs.  But I was also glad to see a lot of familiar faces of character actors like Jeremy Piven, Ron Eldard, and Richard Tyson (a very underrated actor who should get more big roles like his role in THREE O' CLOCK HIGH).     But what makes BLACK HAWK DOWN different is that you don't get much of a character study on these people.  There are no cliche scenes like a soldier holding up a photo of his pregnant young wife, or another soldier waiting to go home and take over the family farm, etc.  No, that's another unique thing about this film is that Scott gives the viewer little information or details about these men's backgrounds.  Yet, he still manages to have us care and be concern when these men are surrounded by hundreds of armed Somalian citizens.  Is it because they are Americans?  Or humanitarians trying to do something right?  Or would we do the same thing if we were in their situation? BLACK HAWK DOWN is without a doubt one of the best films of 2001, and along side with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN as one of the best war films of all time.  Where some directors take a side on the viewpoint of a war or mission (an example would be any John Wayne pro-war film), Scott like Spielberg, instead tells the viewer with his film, that he's not going to take a side on the Somalia issue on whether it was a success or not.  He's going to tell you the facts, and you decide on whether it was necessary, or not for the U.S. troops to be in Somalia.  It's a war movie that makes you think, and also live the experience.  And one more note on this film for Ridley Scott: I personally think it's his best work since the original ALIEN, if I was him, I would be very proud of this film.  I know it's a bold statement to make since Scott has also made other great movies like BLADE RUNNER and GLADIATOR, but when you watch this movie, you too would hopefully understand on why this is a fantastic film.  And it will hopefully forever change your viewpoint, like it did for me, the next time our U.S. soldiers go out on a operation. ***** (out of five)",Null,0,0,26 January 2002
The Insider," The best film of 1999!!!
","Leave it to Michael Mann to direct a epic story about a modern tale of David versus Goliath.  Except this story has two David's and two Goliath's.  Yet, the center of the story is the risks and trouble it takes for one to expose the truth. The first David is Jeffrey Wigand (Rusell Crowe), a former tobacco scientist who was fired for 'poor communication skills.' But Jeffrey was really fired for questioning his bosses at the tobacco company about putting a addictive chemical into cigarettes to increase sales.  It isn't until Jeffrey's and his family's life are threaten that he wants to go to the press and expose the truth. Enter the second David, '60 MINUTES' producer Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino).  Lowell thinks that this could be the biggest story of the decade.  And Lowell and his friend/reporter Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) to run a cover story on what Jeffrey has to say.  But airing a story this big, won't be easy. Now comes the first Goliath, the CBS executives and attorney's.  They feel that airing this story will cause a major lawsuit on CBS, and destroy the business deal of Westinghouse's purchase of the network.  And if Westinghouse doesn't buy CBS, the executives will lose a lot of money. The other Goliath is the big tobacco company.  If Jeffrey testify against his former employer's his health benefits will be taken away, and Jeffrey needs it since one of his daughters suffers from asthma. This is quite a story, and Michael Mann does a brilliant job of bringing it to the screen.  Mann has done a excellent job in the past of showing true to life crime stories: THIEF& MANHUNTER.  A violent, yet historical adaptation of THE LAST OF THE MOHICIANS.  And his biggest and best work yet about a Los Angeles epic crime story, HEAT.  THE INSIDER isn't as good as HEAT, but it does come pretty darn close.  It's the kind of film that goes by quicker and it's more enjoyable every time you watch it.     The acting is top notch as well.  There's a strong supporting cast including: Christopher Plummer, Phillip Baker Hall, Michael Gambon, Diane Verona, Lindsay Crouse, Debbi Mazar, and Bruce McGill.  But the two leads, Pacino and Crowe, definitly stand out for their acting.  Pacino does a excellent job as the network producer who is suffering from trying to get the truth exposed, but is being pushed back from doing that. And Crowe is also excellent as the informer who is looking over his shoulder as he's fearing for his life. What's also great about this film is the excellent cinematography by Dante Spinotti.  Spinotti has done a great job in the past with HEAT and L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, but in THE INSIDER, he displays his best work yet!  Some of the scenes just need to be seen to see how great of a job Spinotti does. And the music score is also wonderful.  It really adds to the suspense and tension that this story brings. That is why I LOVED, THE INSIDER so much.  There is so much to love about it.  Like many other films that try to make a point with it's story, THE INSIDER does it so well.  And Michael Mann not only does it well, but with style.  I will be very disappointed if this film, the actors, and cinematographer don't get recognized in Febuary for the Oscars.  This film well deserves it!  A outstanding, not to be missed classic! ***** (out of five)",10,0,0,21 December 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," The visual masterpiece of all time.
","I was so fortunate yesterday to experience a miracle in the cinema. While thousands were flocking to see the latest installment of the HARRY POTTER series, I instead traveled over thirty miles to catch Stanely Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY on the big screen.  I've seen it several times on cable, video, and DVD.  But watching it yesterday on the big screen was a whole new experience, a experience that I will never forget. Some people will call 2001, Kubrick's best film.  I would disagree, I personally like A CLOCKWORK ORANGE as my favorite.  But 2001 is a hair-line fracture behind CLOCKWORK.  Both films are on my top 20 films of all time. I would have personally like to see 2001 on the Cinerama screen at the Hollywood Archlight Cinerama dome on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood, but beggars can't be choosers.  Seeing it on a big enough screen was pleasing enough. How can I describe 2001 to those who have never seen it before? 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is a film before it's time.  It's the most influental Science Fiction film of all time!  Yes, 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY is more of a influence than STAR WARS and MATRIX.  In fact, when George Lucas was directing STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE, he kept asking his crew about the space scenes in A NEW HOPE: 'is it as good as 2001?' This is a movie that was released before David Lynch's career began, that required several viewings to understand the meaning of the film. Like I said before, I saw the film several times, and watching it on the big screen last night, I discovered new things with the plot. What other person could think of directing a movie in 1968, where a computer is the most reliable and intelligent instrument on a space ship? And thirty-three years later, in the year 2001, the computer is the most reliable instrument on the international space station. Or who else could think of showing a video game of a man playing chess on and with a computer, in 1968? Remember that this movie was released when The Beatles were still putting out new music, the Vietnam War was going on, and San Fransico was psychedlic central.  Speaking of which, this is the film that is dubbed, 'The Ultimate Trip.'  Since people who watched 2001 when it was first released, would drop acid, run up to the front of the theater to lay down and look up at the screen. I pity Warner Bros. for not giving a full re-release of this film last year in 2001, (or at least a one screen per city re-release).  But instead releasing SCOOBY-DOO and BALLISTIC on thousands of screens across the nation, I guess money talks. But why should I mention those pieces of garbage with this film review? I told people for years, and I'll tell you now that I would consider placing a video screen continiously showing 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, with a picture frame around the screen and putting it in a art museum.  When hundreds of years eariler, artists like DiVinci, Monnet, Van Gough, and 20th century artist like Picasso and Dali would express their art though paintings, Kubrick did his expressing through film. This is one of the best movies of all time.  If you ever hear or find out that 2001 is playing on a cinema screen in your area.  I highly urge you to catch it the way it was always ment to be seen, on the big screen.  And I'm sure, Kubrick would agree with me.  This is one of the best films of all time, so giving it ***** (out of five) is to little for the praise it deserves.  But see the film yourself and be the judge, and I hope you'll agree with me.",Null,8,15,16 November 2002
The Last Samurai," Great, but not best picture.
","<Possible Spoilers> One of the most anticipated films this Christmas is the new Tom Cruise film, THE LAST SAMURAI.  I personally was very excited to be seeing this movie (along with RETURN OF THE KING), and I am pleased to say that it is worth the wait. Tom Cruise stars as Capt. Woodrow Algren a U.S. Calvary vetertan who's seen his share of bloodshed.  Algren keeps having haunting flashbacks of seeing his fellow officers and commander, Col. Benjamin Bagly (Tony Goldwyn) slaughter Native Americans (including women in children).   Algren is offered by his friend Zebulah Grant (Billy Connolly) and Bagly to train soldiers in Japan to fight against the Samurai warriors. Algren who has been drinking in his sorrows and looking for a excuse to die feels that this his is moment, he agrees to take the offer and sails off to Japan.Over there Algren meets English journalist/photographer/interperter Simon Graham (Timothy Spall) who informs both Algren (and the viewer) about the Japanesse customs and traditions.  It turns out that the Japanese government, like America have problems with expantation of the railroad, which railroad workers and the Emperor's soldiers are killed by the samurai from the surrounding areas. Algren's expertise and knowledge of previous war experience is much needed for the Japanesse soldiers who wish to 'finish' off the samurai and continue to build the railroad, very much like the western civilaztion. Algren trains the men, yet when Col. Bagly informs that Algren must have the soldiers prepare for battle the next morning, Algren disagrees believing and even showing that the men aren't ready yet. Col. Bagly ignores Algren's comments and orders the unprepared men to fight the next morning. Bagly believes that since the Emperor's soldiers have rifles that they can defeat the primitive samurai's with their 'sticks and arrows.'  The next day, as Algren and the soldiers wait for the samurai in the forrest, the warriors arrive and practically kill all of the Emperor's soldiers, at least the ones who didn't retreat with Col. Bagly. Algren stays behind and since he's been looking for a way or reason to die, he figures to fight to the death.  As eight samurai warriors surround Algren ready to strike, Algren takes one of the samurai flags and defends himself with it. This impresses Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe) the village leader and head samurai. As Algren is then knocked to the ground and is about to be killed by one of the warriors, with quick thinking, he defends himself by stabbing the warrior in the neck killing the samurai. Katsumoto orders his men to take Algren alive instead of death. As Algren recovers he realizes he is being taken care by a beautiful mother who lives in the village named Taka(Koyuki Kato).  It turns out that the warrior that Algren killed was Taka's husband.  Katusmoto informs Algren that he wants him alive to study the 'western' way of battle and war.    However when Algren gets is a lesson of the way the samurai lives as well as the traditional way of the Japanesse culture. But even most important, Algren learns the ways of fighting and defending himself like the samurai. Like one of my favorite films this year (SEABISCUIT), LAST SAMURAI is a familar road traveled.  And like SEABISCUIT, it might be a familar road, yet it is a very enjoyable ride.  When I was watching this film I was ready to dubbed it 'DANCES WITH WOLVES GOES EAST.'   Then as the film continued, I enjoyed this film more, simply because the action scenes were more enjoyable. Yet, although both films have the plot of the individual who was a part of the advancement of the modern world, then realizing that they enjoy the traditional world of what was thought to be their enemies.   Having the central character realize that the world and environement he grew up in was wrong. But, I still did highly enjoy this film.  Tom Cruise did a very good job in this film.  However, I don't think he will be getting that 'Oscar' this year. Cruise wasn't as good as his role in MAGNOLIA, however with LAST SAMURAI Cruise proves that he is one of the best actors working in film. Timothy Spall(ROCK STAR,& VANILLA SKY) did a great job as the 'comic' relief as well as the sidekick to Cpt. Algren.  Tony Goldwyn (GHOST & THE 6TH DAY)does his usual passable role as the villian. However if anyone comes out of this film deserving a Oscar nomination is Ken Watanabe who played the head samurai, Katsumoto.   Watanabe, coming from Japan, gives a outstanding role as the leader who teaches both Algren and the audience that death is meaningful as long it was done with honor. Listening to the audience members after the film was over, a lot of people were impressed with his performance.   I will say that Ken Watanabe should get recognized for his moving and emotional performance. The directing by Edward Zwick is enjoyable.  Zwick who is no stranger to epics (GLORY & LEGENDS OF THE FALL) does a very good job with this film making the 150 mins. go by pretty fast and entertaining.  But the cinematography by two time Oscar winner John Toll (LEGENDS OF THE FALL, BRAVEHEART, ALMOST FAMOUS) does a amazing job! Some of the scenes and images of this film were just very beautiful with the lighting, the images of the flower blossoms, and the tricks of the trade (TOT) shots.What really impressed me with this movie was the fight scenes with the samurai swords.  Woha!  I am a Akira Kurosawa fan, and seeing the sword fights done in this film makes the fights in the recent MATRIX films look pale in comparison. There is one fantastic scene of a unarmed, yet a trained Algren who is surrounded by government samurai's who all have swords. Watching this as well as a few other action scenes with the samurai fighting were great, making most of the action scenes from most of the 2003 films look boring to silly (except for ITALIAN JOB, PIRATES, & KILL BILL). I do applaud Edward Zwick for bringing the excitement and fantastic samurai fighting from the Kurosawa films. Overall, I think THE LAST SAMURAI will get some Oscar nods (Cinematography, Ken Watanabe; maybe picture & director) and it is that grand epic tradition like GLADIATOR, GANGS OF NEW YORK, and BRAVEHEART. It was at times predictable, but it was a fun and enjoyable ride.   Right now, for me, I would say that SEABISCUIT, MYSTIC RIVER, MASTER & COMMANDER, FINDING NEMO and LAST SAMURAI will be the 'front runners' for nominations for Best Picture.  But that might change with other films including  Gus Van Saint's TURTLE, 21 GRAMS, and, of course, PETER JACKSON's RETURN OF THE KING.   But compared to the majority of the films out this year (like GIGLI...yeesh!) LAST SAMURAI proves to be one of the more enjoyable and entertaining films of 2003. ****1/2 (out of five)",8,0,1,25 November 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," A brilliant farewell from a brilliant director.
","Let me start by saying that last March, I was deeply saddened by the death of Stanley Kubrick.  I never met the man, but with reading his biographies and watching his movies countless times, I can understand what the man is trying to say through his films.  I was upset that we will never see the much awaited Kubrick film titled 'A.I.' (ARTIFICIAL INTELLENGENCE), but I am pleased that we will see one more film of Kubrick's titled 'EYES WIDE SHUT.' For months, even before Kubrick's death, I was highly eager for this film.  One of the best director's of all time first film in twelve years (since 1987 FULL METAL JACKET).  And it came no surprise that the film kept getting delayed, (from December of 1998, to March 1999, and finally July 16, 1999).  But I knew Kubrick would do that. One of his most famous tales is that the MGM executives were upset at Kubrick for delaying '2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY.'  One of the MGM exceutives asked Kubrick, 'is that the title of the movie, or when it's coming out?' But the time has come, July 16th has finally arrived.  Before I saw a exclusive sneak of EYES WIDE SHUT, I hyped myself up for this film.  I watched parts of 2001, and all of A CLOCKWORK ORANGE on my DVD player at home, the night before I saw EYES WIDE SHUT.  And when I saw EYES WIDE SHUT, I was prepared. My heart was racing when I saw the Warner Bros. symbol, then the words 'Warner Bros. Presents' 'Tom Cruise' 'Nicole Kidman' 'In A Stanely Kubrick Film.'  The eerie carnival-waltz music playing in the background, while the viewer sees the back-side of Nicole Kidman, as she's undressing.  The viewer sees Kidman, undress until she's completely nude.  Then the words 'EYES WIDE SHUT' appear.  And from there on, I went though the most complex plot and thought provoking film that I have seen since 'THE MATRIX.'  This film really took me out of my theater seat, and into the world of Dr. Bill Hartford (Tom Cruise). This is a brilliant film from a brilliant director!  Stanley Kubrick proved that throughout his carrer, he didn't make one bad movie.  And I feel that EYES WIDE SHUT should be placed with Kubrick's other classics: DR. STRANGELOVE, THE KILLING, A CLOCKWORK ORANGE, 2001, THE SHINING, and the rest of his films.  This is a film that you have to go to, and please bring your intellegence, otherwise, it won't make any sense.  After watching this film with a couple of friends, we discussed how complex the plot was of this film.  And days later, we still talk about certain scenes and plot points in the film. It's like going to a crime scene, and trying to figure out who did the murder, and what was the motive. What other director can do this to a film!  Kubrick tells both so much, and so little.  He let's the viewer think about what's going on, but doesn't show it.  He'll let the viewer think about what's going to happen, but won't say.  Very few director's in Hollywood or in the film industry will do this.  Instead they would rather 'entertain' the viewer. They tell the story, let the viewer know what happend, and what's going to happen to them in the future, and then give them a happy ending.  Kubrick isn't like that, he doesn't make entertainment, he makes art.  2001 is one of the few films that I would say, deserves a gold frame around it's screen, and placed in the Louve in Paris. EYES WIDE SHUT is another film that deserves that same treatment.  This is a work of art,the editing, the cinematography, the acting, the errie music, and the story are all done with a touch of brillance.  This is a worthy film of Kubrick's. Unlike other film critic's I respect Stanley Kubrick and his family very much.  So out of respect, I will not reveal any of the plot points or discuss the plot.  The plot of the film is both too simple and complex to discuss.  It's something that needs to been seen, to understand.  But I will mention this, Kubrick fans will notice Kubrick using some of his famous directing moves in this film. The Christmas party in EYES WIDE SHUT looks very similar to the Gold Ballroom scene in THE SHINING.  The following the character around the huge building without cutting, or doing a different camera angle.  The unique camera angles, the very rapid long shot to extreme close up shot (done in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE when Alex sees his old droogs become officer's.  And in THE SHINING when Wendy sees the shocking mirror reflection of the word 'murder').  And the single character standing alone in a big room, or walking down the street. No surprise, I found this not only one of the best films of the year, but also of all time.  I'm sad that were not going to see another Kubrick film.  But I am glad that I lived in a time to see his work.  To be both influenced and astonished at the same time, while watching his movies. Farewell Stanley, thank you very much for the works of art, and may you rest in peace.   ***** (out of five)",10,0,0,18 July 1999
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," PULP FICTION & 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY, English Style.
","I heard very little before seeing this movie.  I was just told by my friends that it's the best film to come from England since 'THE FULL MONTY' and that it's great!  So, I put on my Dr. Martin's boots, put in my collection of English Pop Music from the 80's and early 90's (New Order, OMD, The Farm, Madness, etc.) and got into my English mood.  After seeing this movie, I was pleased, very very pleased!  I think this movie is better and more exciting than the current #1 film at the box office, 'THE MATRIX.' 'LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS' has different stories.  They range from losing a huge bet during a poker game, two clumsy thieves stealing two antique shot-guns, a gang of young men figuring out on how to get 500,000 Pounds to a mob boss by Sunday, another gang planing on stealing money from weed dealers, and so on. This has been done many times, PULP FICTION is the most famous version, 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY was the most underrated, and GO is the most recent.  But what makes this film work?  Simple, the characters, the stories, the rich dark humor, and the directing.  You actually care about these characters, you wonder on what's going to happen to them next.  I was amazed to see YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES Nichols Rowe on screen after not seeing him for almost 15 years.  But if anyone stands out with their character or acting, it would be Vinnie Jones playing 'Big Chris' the hit-man for the Mob Boss Harry 'Hatchet' Lonsdale. He brings his son who's about ten years old along during his work, 'Big Chris' even allows his son to watch him beat up on a person, but he won't allow him to swear or to blasphemy. Along with other great U.K. films 'TRAINSPOTTING' 'THE COMMITMENTS' 'THE FULL MONTY' 'WAKING NED DIVINE' 'MONA LISA' 'THE KRAYS' 'THE LONG GOOD FRIDAY' and all of the Monty Python films.  'LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS' proves that you can always rely on the English for great entertainment. Don't miss it!!  ***** out of ***** (Five stars out of five)",10,0,0,7 April 1999
Mystic River," The best Eastwood film since UNFORGIVEN!
","Ever since I saw UNFORGIVEN, I was conformed with my thoughts on Clint Eastwood.  I always thought of Eastwood as the 'action-packed,' gun carrying superstar who said tough-guy lines like 'Do ya feel lucky punk?' and the classic, 'Go ahead, make my day.'  Then after watching UNFORGIVEN, I was blown away on how different of a western it was, aging gunfighters, who are past their prime, now are going to be doing one more job.  Now I am a strong devotee of Clint Eastwood, watching and buying DVD copies of all of his films (that includes the hokey EVERY WHICH WAY and ANY WHICH WAY films with 'Clyde'). With MYSTIC RIVER, I was a little disappointed not seeing Clint in front of the camera, which I always do enjoy.  Yes, he's pushing 73, but still, it's a nice familar face.  But after watching MYSTIC RIVER, I got past not seeing Clint's face, yet his work as a filmmaker showed. MYSTIC RIVER is based on the Dennis Lehane best seller, which takes place in a certain section of Boston, near the river.  Three boys are playing on the street and decide to use a stick to write their names in the wet cement. A car pulls up and a tough looking man comes out saying he's a cop, and is threatening to arrest the boys for defacing property.  After the officer asks where the three boys live (two lived on that street, one lived a few blocks away), the boy who lived a few blocks away is ordered by the man to get into the back of his car to 'take him home.'  The scary and sad thing is that the boy wasn't taken home right away... Flash-forward to 25 years later, where the three boys are adults. Jimmy (Sean Penn) is a business owner of a corner store, he served some time in prison, got out and is trying to make a new life. Jimmy is in his second marriage to Annabeth (Laura Linney) and has three daughters, Jimmy's eldest daughter, Katie (Emmy Rossum) is 18 and works for Jimmy at his store. Sean (Kevin Bacon) is a Boston homicide officer who still gets phone calls from his ex-wife who doesn't say a word, yet Sean knows it's her and talks to her still with no response.  Then there's Dave (Tim Robbins) the adult who still is suffering emotionally from the time he went into the backseat of the police officer's car. On a Saturday night before Jimmy's daughter's communion, Katie goes out driking with some friends.  Later that night, Dave came home with blood on his hands and shrit, Dave's wife, Celeste (Marcia Gay Harden) is worried on what happend to her husband.  When Jimmy and Annabeth go to their daughter's communion, Jimmy is upset that Katie didn't show up.  Sean along with his homicide partner, Whitey (Laurence Fishburn) get a call about a car sitting in the middle of the road with blood.  It turns out that the car was Katie's, with Katie's body found not far from the car.  The story has several conflicts and revealing information about the character's of the film as the plot continues. I was highly impressed and pleased with MYSTIC RIVER.  After watching this film, KILL BILL Vol. 1, SCHOOL OF ROCK, and LOST IN TRANSLATION; the last four weeks of movies have been much better than the last ten months. It is obvious why critics are calling this one of the best pictures of the year, it's because its true! I was hooked on the mystery of both the character's past that was involved with the plot, as well as the mystery about the murder of Katie. It's no surprise why the mystery for MYSTIC RIVER works so well, the screenplay was written by Brian Helgeland, who won an Oscar along with Curtis Hanson for his adaptation for L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, the best crime-noir film since CHINATOWN.  The film manages to give full rich detail on the three characters and even gives detailed information of the supporting characters as well. Another important factor in which Eastwood should be applauded for is shooting the film in the actual location in which the story takes place, outside of Boston.  If there is a film or story where the location becomes part of the character, then it's critical to have the story take place in that location, otherwise it won't have right feel for the movie.  Think of Michael Mann's HEAT taking place in L.A. but shot in Chicago, it would take away the impact of the film.  With MYSTIC RIVER, Eastwood demanded that the film needed to be shot Charlestown, Boston instead of the studio's decision of Toronto (because it's cheeper). The acting by Sean Penn is along with Bill Murry, as one of the best this year.  I have always enjoyed Mr. Penn's work (I've can see Penn being the most talented young actor under 50 (along with Edward Norton and Johnny Depp).  Penn gives a very fantastic performance in this film, you could actually feel his grief when he finds out that his daughter was killed. Yet kudos should also go out to Tim Robbins for his performance of Dave, the man who is still scarred by the actions that happened to him 25 years eariler. Robbins manages to have a convincing look of emotional scars that have been haunting him for years, and it shows in his eyes.  I also enjoyed the performances and the investigating plot of Kevin Bacon and Laurence Fishburne's characters.  Bacon can be a great actor in a bad movie (HOLLOW MAN for example) yet Bacon proves that he can even carry his own performance along with Robbins and Penn.  And Fishburne shows that he is one of the most powerful supporting actors working in Hollywood with this film. I would finally have to give credit to Eastwood himself.  No longer being seen as the man who is use to carrying a .44 magnium shooting bad guys. Now he's the figure who thinks about even questions on why did he shoot that man, like he discussed in UNFORGIVEN and in this film as well.  Eastwood manages to tell a story in which the characters might appear fine, yet they have ghosts inside of them that will haunt them forever.  And before I forget, Eastwood's brauva talent shows again by being the score composure for this film!  I expected the usual great music by Eastwood regular Lennie Neihaus, but when I saw that Eastwood composed the music, I was pleasently surprised.  Also, for those other Eastwood fans out there, a familar face makes a unexpected yet highly enjoyable cameo appearance.  I'm not going to say who it is, but when you see this familar actor and make the connection, it is a nice treat. MYSTIC RIVER proves once again that Clint Eastwood is one of the best directors still working. Sadly, most people can't imagine Eastwood as anything else but Dirty Harry; and when Eastwood passes away, people will then say, 'oh wow, he did do a lot of work.'  Well, I'm saying it now, Eastwood is a underappreciated director, watch his other directed films: BIRD, BRONCO BILLY, BRIDGES OF MADISON COUNTY, and MIDNIGHT IN THE GARDEN OF GOOD & EVIL, and you too would hopefully agree with me that Eastwood is a darn great director! There is no doubt that MYSTIC RIVER is going to be remembered come Feburary when the Oscars are announced.  I can see this film having nominations in several catagories, especially Best Actor (for Penn), Best Supporting Actor (Robbins), Best Director, and Best Picture.  This film was even nominated for Best Picture at the Cannes Film Festival, which in my opinion is the more suitable Academy Awards.  Look what won Best Picture at Cannes last year- Polanski's THE PIANIST.  I rest my case.  One of the best films this year! ***** (out of five)",10,0,1,21 October 2003
A Beautiful Mind," The movie that Ron Howard should be remembered for.
","I think that when a person is put on Earth, they are put here and in their place for a reason.  I feel that Ron Howard was put here on Earth, not for acting, but for filmmaking. Just like Steven Spielberg, both directors have has a excellent career full of features, but there will the that one film that stands above the rest.  Ironically, both Spielberg and Howard's greatest directing achievements deal with the human spirit.  For StevenSpielberg it is SCHINDLER'S LIST, for Ron Howard, it's A BEAUTIFUL MIND. For years we, as film viewers, have seen movies about human achievements.  FORREST GUMP, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, and BRAVEHEART are among the human achievement films.  But those films are about the central character overcoming the odds against society or the system.  A BEAUTIFUL MIND is something much different, it's about overcoming the odds that lie in oneself.  John Forbes Nash Jr. (Russell Crowe) is a highly intelligent mathematician who is enthusiastic about his solving and completing math problems.  His work and accomplishments have gotten the attention of a government program that has Nash work for the mathematics department along with two co-workers that he went to Princeton with, Sol (Adam Goldberg) and Bender (Anthony Rapp).  Nash not only does number solving, but also teaching, which is how he meets his true devoted love in life Alicia (Jennifer Connelly), who later becomes Nash's wife.  It's while working for the government that Nash is recruited by a mysterous agent, Parcher (Ed Harris).  Parcher tells Nash that there is a huge cold war Russian conspiracy, where the Russians are communicating with each other by putting coded messages with letters and words in American newspaper and magazines. It is by doing this that Nash feels that doing highly top secret government work, that he feels that he is being followed and watched, and which leds Nash to become paranoid and fear for Alicia and his own life. What makes A BEAUTIFUL MIND much more different than any other film that I have seen, is that the picture takes you into the mind of John Nash Jr.  You see the world from his view, how he finds the numbers, digits, and letter codes in the media articles; the way he does formulas on how his classmates can succeed on the four of them each leaving the bar with a woman; and by looking at someone's neck tie, how the design can be done identical redone with a crystal drinking glass and sunlight.  It shows that this is a human being who means good for this planet.  Nash only would like to solve formulas and to assit society as much as possible, the same society that he admits that he doesn't get along well with.  But sadly, we see Nash's problems and fears as he feels that the whole world is closing in on him. I have always enjoyed the career of Ron Howard, NIGHT SHIFT, COCOON, BACKDRAFT, FAR & AWAY, & APOLLO 13 are all wonderful films that Howard has shown his talent and skill as a filmmaker.  But there is that one film that manages to amaze the viewer, the movie that you would expect to be good or well done, but it winds up becoming something much more.  A BEAUTIFUL MIND is that film, it gives you a lesson in life, a lesson that will hopefully change the way you would look at life forever. Russell Crowe gives the acting performance of his life with his performance as John Nash Jr.  Crowe shows on his face his fear and frustration that Nash went though when dealing with his psycholigical problems.  It is very rare when a actor gives the ability for the viewer to see and understand the world through their character's eyes and ears.  And when a actor or actress can do that, then that is when they deserve the award for Best Acting for that year.  For a while, I couldn't think that anybody could have done a better acting job this past year than Gene Hackman gave in ROYAL TENENBAUMS, I was amazed and surprised to see Russell Crowe was the person who accomplished that job. Now I am rooting for both Hackman and Crowe for Best Actor, but if I had to lean towards one, I would lean towards Crowe.  I highly enjoyed Hackman's performance, I have never laughed and enjoyed a character so much in years. But when one is in tears by being emotionally touched by the performance that Crowe gives, then you could understand the change in heart.  Perhaps it is because that I understand what Nash is going though since I also have deamons in my mind.  Then again we all have deamons or fear that lurks inside of us, it's what makes us human. And to see one try to overcome those deamons, you can't help but feel for that person. There are also excellent support for Crowe in this film.  Ed Harris as the government agent, Christopher Plummer as Dr. Rosen, Paul Bettany, Adam Goldberg, Josh Lucas, and Anthony Rapp as Nash's friends all give superb performances in the film.  But the one person who stands out among the support, and almost outshines Crowe's performance is given by Jennifer Connelly.  I have always enjoyed the work of Jennifer Connelly, LABRYNTH, HOT SPOT, and REQUIEM FOR A DREAM have all shown how talented Connelly could be.  But it is in A BEAUTIFUL MIND where Connelly gives the performance of her life as the worried and strongly supportive wife of Nash.  It could have been easy for any other actress go into stereotype cliche and have the character of Alicia break out and yell, 'I can't take this anymore!'  No, instead we get real human emotions as Connelly, playing Alicia, is very much worried about her husband's state of mind. Yet, it is her love for Nash, which is much stronger, is what keeps Alicia supporting Nash. It has been years since I have loved a movie that won Best Picture. Don't get me wrong, I highly enjoyed AMERICAN BEAUTY, GLADIATOR, SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE, TITANIC, and BRAVEHEART.  But there was always that one movie, that I thought, that should have won instead(INSIDER, TRAFFIC, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, APOLLO 13).I have a strong feeling that this film will win Best Picture.  And if it does, then there isn't any other movie this year that deserves it more. This is a monumental success in modern filmmaking, and by all means this movie is a must to be seen.  It should be, since it is now along with ROYAL TENENBAUMS, my favorite film of 2001 (sorry ALI).  *****",Null,0,2,7 February 2002
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Again, there's magic in this film.
","Geeze, it was just last year I was raving about the most hyped film of last year, HARRY POTTER & THE SORCERERS STONE.  I loved how well done it was protrayed from the J.K. Rowling best seller, the actors, sets, costumes, etc.  I thought Daniel Radcliffe, was excellent as Harry Potter, as well as Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley and Emma Watson as Hermoine Granger.  Now, 364 days later, I experience more magic again in the follow-up sequel, HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS. This time, unlike the original, the film begins right into the plot. Where the original introduced viewers to characters, locations, magic items and history.  Think of it like, uh... LETHAL WEAPON 2, it begins right into the action, which CHAMBER OF SECRETS does as well. It's been three months since Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) left Hogwarts for summer vacation, and it hasn't been a fun summer since Harry is living at Uncle Vernon (Richard Griffiths), Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and rude cousin Dudley (Harry Melling).  But Harry wonders why haven't any of his friends from Hogwarts (particulary Ron and Hermoine) haven't written to him.  Then Harry meets Dobby, a house elf who warns Harry not to return to Hogwarts.  Harry ignores Dobby, since Hogwarts is a million times nicer than his realitives. But this year attending at Hogwarts there are some faces introduced. First is Lucius Malfoy (that wonderful character actor Jason Isaacs) the cruel and vicious father of Harry's rival Draco Malfoy.  Then there's Professor Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) who smiles proudly and is the most vain person you could ever see.  But this year at Hogwarts (and why does this happen when Harry attends school there?) there is evil lurking about that turns some students petrified and messages written in blood on the wall warning about 'the Chamber of Secrets.' Like I said, I highly loved the orignal film, THE SORCERER'S STONE, and how does this one come up to par?  This is another winner!  I enjoyed this film just as much, if not more than the original.  But then again, I've read the first two books of Harry Potter, and I enjoyed CHAMBER OF SECRETS more than SORCERER'S STONE. Why is this film better? First, the film goes right into the action, I understand the original had to introduce the world to the story, and that was fine.  Yet this film goes right into the action and begins telling us what is going on.  Like the STAR WARS, GODFATHER, and BACK TO THE FUTURE films, it assumes that we did see the first film (and who didn't?).  Second, I always thought the action was more exciting and intense in CHAMBER OF SECRETS, and in this film it shows.  Third, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson all fit into their character roles so fine and well, that we are now acceppting them as Harry, Ron, and Harmione, just like we accept Harrison Ford as Han Solo, or Al Pacino as Michael Corlone.  It's just that this time around, all three young actors seem more relaxed and calm about playing their roles, and I don't blame them.  Plus the same goes for the other actors who are returning to this film.  Finally, it's more darker, complex, and exciting than the original. With HARRY POTTER & THE CHAMBER OF SECRETS, the Potter films are becomming to be a series worthy of being placed with other great series like STAR WARS and INDIANA JONES.  This film running about twenty minutes longer than the original, goes just as fast, if not faster than the original. Proof:  I didn't have to go to the bathroom, I stuck it out through out all of the film. Sadly, this film isn't getting the hype like the original.  I'm guessing that the press is tired of hyping up the Potter films and figures that it's going to be a hit. Then there are those people who feel like STAR WARS, 'you've seen one, you've seen them all.'  Well, I'm hoping that word gets around and people realize that like the books, the Potter films are getting better as Harry gets older.  I guess you can say that Harry Potter is indeed like fine wine and ages well with it.  This film should do more business than the original, but not even the superior EMPIRE STRIKES BACK couldn't make more money than STAR WARS (A NEW HOPE to the Jedi fanatics).All I can say is that the later part of 2001 is returning again with the success of another HARRY POTTER film.  And I know it will return next month with LORD OF THE RINGS: THE TWO TOWERS.  It's a pity that we are going to have to wait for two years for HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONERS OF AZKABAN. It's also a pity that we won't experience the wonderful Richard Harris playing Professor Albus Dumbledore again.  But hopefully the wait will pay off since I thought PRISONERS OF AZKABAN was much better than CHAMBER OF SECRETS (here's wishing Alfonso Cuaron the best of luck!)But as for the films out right now, CHAMBER OF SECRETS is a excellent film.  Is it for the entire family?  Maybe, it depends.  If the kids didn't get scared from the first one, or from reading or listening to the book, then it would be a great film for them.  It helps build the imagination. If the kids might get scared, then SANTA CLAUSE 2 is a very nice alternate, NOT 8 MILE, which some parents seem to think it is. All in all, Harry's second year at Hogwarts is a successful one.  And hopefully it proves that the Harry Potter films aren't going to be a overrun franchise like the BATMAN or STAR TREK films.  Harry Potter now belongs in the dignified series.  Don't miss it!  ***** (out of five)",10,0,0,15 November 2002
The Green Mile," Miracle Mile.
","People would think that this film from the same director as THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, that this is another prison film.  Well, it isn't. SHAWSHANK was more about a man's search for hope.  The director, Frank Darabont, new film THE GREEN MILE, isn't about a prison, but about a miracle that happens in a prison.  This is a outstanding film that shows what a miracle that could, or we wish that could happen, and how would mankind treat it. The story is based on the Stephen King novel, where it takes place on 'E' block of a prison in Louisiana.  The 'E' block is the death row, also known as 'the green mile.'  On the mile, the chief of the security is Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks), a sympathetic guard who cares about the health of most of his prisoners.  Paul has fellow kind and friendly guards at the mile which include, Brutus 'Brutal' Howell (David Morse), Dean Stanton (Barry Pepper), and Harry Terwilleger (Jeffrey DeMunn).  There is one rotten apple in the bunch of guards, and his name is Percy Wetmore (Doug Hutchison).  Percy doesn't care about anybody but himself.  Percy is cruel to the inmates, and loves to taunt them. One day a new convict arrives to the 'green mile,' a seven foot and 300 pound black man named John Coffey (Michael Duncan Clark).  Coffey (sounds like the drink, spelled different)was convicted of killing two young girls. But when Paul talks and meets Coffey, he believes that Coffey didn't kill the two young girls.  But that is only a part of the story.  There's a secret in Coffey that is a blessing or a miracle.  Whatever you call it, it's highly unusual for someone to have, and it does good towards humanity. THE GREEN MILE has 'classic' written all over it.  This is a truly fantastic film!  Despite it's 3 hour plus running time, it's the fastest paced 3 hour film since TITANIC.  The story and character's grab your intrest, that time doesn't matter to you.  You're more concerned about the people.  That element alone is a sign of success. Frank Darabont tells a strongly dramatic film that isn't about a prison, but takes place in one.  It's a very emotional film, yet you would walk out of the film not only falling in love with it, but somewhat happy. Darabont does a excellent job of detailing the character's and their feelings and  traits.  And like SHAWSHANK, Darabont does a magnificent job on adapting the work of Stephen King.  If I was Stephen King, I would have only Frank Darabont direct the film adaptations of my stories from now on. But the acting is also worthy of picking up golden statues.  Tom Hanks is different and great as the very kind and caring prison guard.  So are his fellow guards (Morse, Pepper, and DeMunn).  James Cromwell is also excellent as the prison warden who isn't the 'stereotyped' warden.  And Michael Jeter is quite good as the mousy prisoner Eduard Delaeriox, who's best friend is a mouse.  But two faces or actors stand out in this film.  First is Doug Hutchison, who is very cruel and creepy as the evil guard.  His character of Percy, is the type of villian that you would love to see him get punished.  And the other actor who stands out is Michael Duncan Clark.  Clark is huge, yet he's very emotional and gentle as Coffey that the audience does feel a certain kind of kinship towards him.  You care about Coffey, that you also would believe Paul that Coffey can't be a murderer. I was extremely pleased with this classic. This has Oscar for Best Picture (winning, not nomminated) all over it. It is indeed over 3 hours, yet you'll feel a lot different after watching this movie.  It's a excellent tale about miracles, that happen in the most unlikely places.  And if they do happen, don't abuse them, bless them.  THE GREEN MILE, is paved with gold!  DO NOT MISS IT!!!!!! ***** (out of five)",Null,0,0,24 November 1999
Jaws," Happy 25th to the scariest movie of all time!
","It's a miracle that it's been 25 years since this film has been released.  I unfortunate didn't get to see this in the theater (I was born a year later), but countless viewings on video, cable, television, laserdisc, and now DVD has made this my second favorite film of all time.  What's rather ironic, is that Steven Spielberg consider this film his 'nightmare' not because it scares him, but because it was a nightmare to make. With 'Bruce' (the mechanical shark) keep breaking down, Spielberg went over budget and schedule to complete this film. He might call it a nightmare, I call it a blessing in disguise. Because of not showing the beast until over a hour into the film, it's a Hitchock element that even Alfred himself would be proud of. And the characters, the timid and aquaphobic Amity police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider).  The scary, experienced, and strong-headed fishman Quint (Robert Shaw).  The excited, knowledgeable, and brave marine biologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss).  The community concerned as well as economic minded town mayor, Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton).  And also the loving, worried, and tender wife and mother, Ellen Brody (Lorraine Gary).The story is very complex, from a problem that Mayor Vaughn will continue to ignore, until it swims right up and bites him in the.... well, you know.  The police cheif from New York City, who moves to a more quiet and relaxed community, only to find that he has more problems in Aminity than he does in the big city, not to mention being afraid of the water, and living on a island.  When it's only a island when you're on the water.  The scruffy fisherman that is the town terror, who torments everyone from a child playing the clarinet to the entire town in a meeting.  Plus not to mention the gigantic 25 foot and 3 ton great white beast that snacks on anything that swims. Because of this movie, it has influenced me a lot in life. First, it has open my mind with movies, not to make exciting movies, but also excellent movies.  Second, it has helped me gather research on Steven Speilberg, which I find this to be his best film, above E.T. and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK (although those films are also classics!)  Third, to confront my fears, I am like Chief Brody and am terrified of the water, and seeing that bloody shark doesn't help me.  But by watching this film, it encourages to stand up against my fears and face them.  And finally, it is just as exciting to watch the first time just as much as it is to watch it the one millionth time. This is the movie that introduced the world to Steven Speilberg, not E.T., not SCHINDLER'S LIST, and not JURASSIC PARK, it was JAWS.  Because of JAWS, the entire planet has seen this director evolve from doing films that are from the imagination of a child to doing serious films with important meaning.  Countless people label this film the first 'summer blockbuster' I label it the classic films for the new generation.  From STAR WARS to PERFECT STORM, JAWS was the first film to have big special effects, big budget, exciting action scenes, and a excellent story.  This film will forever be a timeless classic.  ***** (one of the best movies of all time!)",10,2,4,13 July 2000
Bring It On," Huh-Huh! Huh-Huh! Cheerleaders! Huh-Huh! Huh-Huh!
","Bring in the audience who loved that 1995 teen flick, CLUELESS, because we've got another film for those girls, and it's BRING IT ON.  But unlike CLUELESS, this film was more original, funnier, and more charming than a modern rip-off of Jane Austin's Emma. The tale of BRING IT ON has the five time champion San Diego Toro's cheerleading squad begin a new school year.  The new captain of the squad, Torrance (Kristin Dunst) is filling in some big shoes to try to get another national championship. When they look for some new recruits, only Torrance is impressed with Missy (Eliza Dushku) as the other female cheerleaders snub her thinking she's too 'trashy.'  But it's Torrance's determination that get's the former gymnastic Missy in the squad.  But there's trouble, Missy reveals to Torrance that the moves and cheers that the previous Toro's captain made were not original, they were stolen!  And they were stolen from the East Compton Clovers, led by the cold and icy Isis (Gabrielle Union). So it's up to Torrance to live up to her title and try to come up with some new dance moves that appear to be more original.  In the meantime, Torrance is getting more and more distant with her boyfriend who went off to college and is getting more attracted to Missy's brother, Cliff (Jesse Bradford).  But don't worry, Missy and Torrance still remain friends. And that is what makes this movie fun, it doesn't really pull off stupid teenage cliches that one would see on either the Disney channel or early morning Saturday NBC line-up just before the Suns vs. the Lakers basketball game.  It does have some creativity in it.  I did notice some pretty darn good camera shots (and no, not just shots of the girls!) but some rather creative shots that feature the dancing and style of this movie. As I sat in the theater watching this movie (as I had a wicked smirk on my face with drool falling down from my mouth) I decided that I really enjoyed this film.  It's a nice change to see the cheerleaders try to compete in a event, and not just the lame-brained football jocks.  In fact, I enjoyed this film, A LOT more than any recent teenage football movie, where the players are treated like gods, and the cheerleaders are taunting sex objects.  No, instead in BRING IT ON, it's the football players that are dumb and the cheerleaders are a bit more smarter.  And from my high school days, that seemed more realistic, since my high school football team had a poor record. I did enjoy the acting in this film, particularly by both Kristen Dunst and Eliza Dushku.  Dunst does carry a film well (DICK is a good example of that) and she does have charm and wit added to her character.  And Dushku turns a two-dimensional character and makes her appear more real, as she has more feelings and intelligence than most of the other cheerleaders. And I would like to also mention that both ladies are very beautiful and if the sound went out while watching the movie, I would still be enjoying this film. O.K. so I give the 'Guilty Pleasure Film of 2000' Award to BRING IT ON, but at least it's a film that I can watch with a woman and not be embarrassed, unlike SHOWGIRLS.  But after thinking about it for a while, it does manage to not go routine and typical like any other teen flick.  It's not the best teen flick, but it is better than a majority of the teen flicks out today.  So go see this film, it's a nice and happy movie for a change. **** (out of five)",8,0,0,30 August 2000
The Terminal," Another enjoyable film from Mr. Spielberg! (Possible Spoilers)
","There is something that I was educated about Steven Spielberg 13 years ago right before HOOK was released. Not every Spielberg film is going to be a classic. When there is a new and upcoming Spielberg film, audiences are anticipating for it to be another classic, like JAWS, RAIDERS, E.T., etc. I, at least learned that not every Spielberg film is going to be a classic. The film however, is at least going to be good. That way my expectations are not raised that high. And when a movie like SCHINDLER'S LIST, or SAVING PRIVATE RYAN come along, I will be pleasantly surprised, and wind up loving the film.The past ten years, Spielberg's films range from the classic (SCHINDLER'S LIST, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, AMISTAD, & MINORITY REPORT); underrated and deserves at least two viewings (A.I. & LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK); and highly entertaining (JURASSIC PARK, and CATCH ME IF YOU CAN). Spielberg isn't trying to make every movie a classic, he's trying to at least be entertaining. With that said, Spielberg's latest film, THE TERMINAL, falls under the highly entertaining category.TERMINAL tells the story of Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks), a immigrant from a fictional Eastern European country who is visiting America for the first time. When Viktor arrives at the immigration office at the New York City airport, he is informed to report to the office of one of the Homeland Security chiefs, Frank Dixon (Stanley Tucci). Dixon informs Viktor that his home country's government is under attacked, Viktor's visa into the U.S. isn't accepted, while Viktor can not return to his native land. Dixon's solution is to have Viktor wait at the airport, possibly illegally sneak out of the airport onto American soil, and have immigration officers worry about Viktor's fate.Viktor, however decides to at least apply for a travel visa, with the immigration office, getting rejected at every visit. Viktor knows that he can't return home and doesn't want to break any laws, decides to wait for a legal approval to enter into the U.S. While waiting, Viktor meets and befriends some of the airport terminal employees. There a shy food server (Diego Luna) who's secretly in love with one of the INS officers (Zoe Saldana) . Gupta Rajan, the rude janitor (played by Wes Anderson regular Kumar Pallana) who thinks that Viktor is possibly a intelligence officer, while he takes pleasure watching the dashing passengers ignore the 'wet floor' signs as they slip on the wet floor. A baggage handler (Chi McBride) who sees Viktor as being harmless. And Amelia Warren (Catherine Zeta-Jones), an airline stewardess who has dated several men (including married men), yet finds normal attraction in Viktor.From taking my Spielberg/Lucas class a few years ago, analyzing the themes and subtext messages in Spielberg's films, TERMINAL is more or less a film about a man moving into a new neighborhood. Similar to previous films done about a new figure moving into town and changing the lives of everybody (CHOCOLATE & THE MAJESTIC as recent examples). TERMINAL does follow that familiar plot element. Except, this time the hero doesn't move into a town, but an airport terminal instead.Yet, like a town there is a assortment of personalities: the timid and shy young man who loves the girl who is so caught up in her career; the humorous and cool older man; the grumpy and misunderstood elderly gentleman; the antagonist who sees the hero as a threat; and the very beautiful woman that the hero falls in love with. If it sounds like a Frank Capra film, then no surprise it is. However, remember that Spielberg was highly influenced by Capra-Corn.I enjoyed the performances in TERMINAL, with Hanks proving again that he is one of the greatest actors working in cinema. The first 30 minutes of the film, Hanks does a fantastic job playing Viktor as a man who doesn't understand or speak much English. One scene that stands out with Hanks' performance is when Viktor finds out for the first time about a military coup going on in his homeland from the cable news reports. Hanks gives a marvelous performance with his character showing pain, anxiety, fear, confusion, and sadness all at the same time. I mean, darn it, that scene had me in tears when I was watching it, you can't help but feel sorry for the guy.The supporting performance in TERMINAL are also quite good. Stanley Tucci gives another good role playing the man who insists that he is doing the right thing, despite being the only person who thinks that. Diego Luna, Chi McBride, Kumar Pallana, and Barry Shabaka Henley do all give superb performances. I did feel that Catherine Zeta-Jones also gave a good job, yet I personally would have like to have seen more of her character.The amazing thing with TERMINAL is the set design, reconstructing the airport terminal. Since Spielberg couldn't shoot at a real airport, he constructed a fictional terminal from a airplane hanger. And looking at the terminal, you would think it was real. I knew before hand that the terminal was only a set. Yet, I did enjoy overhearing other audience members whispering to each other 'is that LAX? Kennedy? or Logan Airport?' Set designer Anne Kuljian and Production Designer Alex McDowell did a fantastic job creating a realistic airport terminal. With the arrival/departure reader board with the flapping letters & numbers; to the massive amount of stores and restaurants. The terminal features Borders Books, Burger King, Sbarro Pizza, Nathan's Hot Dogs, Discovery Channel Store, Hugo's, and even a Verizon Wireless Phone store (it's only fitting since the Verizon spokesperson is the co-star of the film. On a side note: it would have been funny to see Zeta-Jones' character leave the Verizon store shaking her phone and complaining that particular store's cellular phones do not work. But since this summer has been filled with massive special effects extravaganzas, it is nice to see a film again that focuses on characters and not visuals. So far, I would say that THE TERMINAL is the most enjoyable film this summer (along with HARRY POTTER & THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN). Like the past summer's from the previous years, it is fun to see big lavish movies like SPIDER-MAN, PIRATES OF THE CARRIBEAN, MINORITY REPORT, and X-2. But then it's very comforting that plot/character driven films like ROAD TO PERDITION and SEABISCUIT are also released. And that is exactly what TERMINAL is, a highly entertaining plot/character driven film. It is not a Spielberg classic, but it is very enjoyable and entertaining. And that's good enough for me! ***** (out of five)",10,1,2,12 June 2004
Blow," The Rise and Fall of George Jung.
","BLOW is a very familar film with a very familar storyline.  Yes, we've been there and done that before, and there is no surprise on what is going to happen in the end.  However, there hasn't been anybody like Ted Demme to approach a story like BLOW and use it in a unique and stylish fashion. BLOW is the true life story of George Jung (Johnny Depp) the man who introduced cocanie into the American culture in the 1970's.  If Jung's business of dealing cocanie was leagl, he would have ran the third richest business in America.  Everybody and anybody was doing cocaine in the 70's, it was a illeagl drug, but it wasn't know to be dangerous.  The film shows the entire rise and fall of young George.  From when he witnessed his father Fred Jung (Ray Liotta) file for bankruptcy, and his shrewd mother (Rachel Griffiths) keep leaving and returning to the family house, to his current state that he is in now.  After George leaves his family in Massasschussets, he moves out west to California with his very large friend Tuna (MALLRAT'S Ethan Suplee).  In California George meets and falls in love with a beautiful blond stwardess, Barbara (Fanka Potente).  Barbara introduces George to pot, and George figures that he should sell it.  Barbara then has George make a deal with Derek Foreal (a flamboyant Paul Rubens) to help sell the mary jane.  The stuff sells like crazy and George is in the drug dealing business, until he gets caught and put into prision.  In prision his cellmate (Jordi Molla) talks to George about cocaine and how popular it's going to be.  George takes his friend's word of advice and both deal with the dangerous Pablo Escobar (Cliff Curtis) on selling cocaine in the U.S. Now George is richer than he ever could imagine, he actually has a apartment full of bills (no kidding!)  While his partner gets married, George meets the beautiful Mirtha (Penelope Cruz) who looks tame, but has a wild life and a strong fire burning inside of her.  Then when things couldn't get better, everything falls down to a deep dark abyss. I see BLOW similar to other classic movies like GOODFELLAS meets TRAFFIC.  And all three films are similar. However like a rollercoster, we all know what the ride is like, we know the loops, twists and turns, and the drops.  But BLOW is like a rollercoster ride, we know what to expect, yet we still enjoy it a lot anyways. I really enjoyed the opening scene where director Demme shows the processing of cocaine in South America while he has the Rolling Stone's 'Can't You Hear Me Knocking?' blasting on the soundtrack.  And some of the editing and cinemtography in this film is brilliant!  It's a shame that this movie didn't come out last year in 2000, it would have earned some Oscar nominations, maybe even some Oscars.  And if we're lucky, we probably won't see anything this spectacular for a while. The acting in this film is also fantastic.  Johnny Depp proves that along with his FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS co-star (Benecio Del Toro) that he is overdue for a Academy Award.  Depp plays a unrecoganizable role of George with the Boston accent, the long sideburns, and the big gut.  I also enjoyed Ray Liotta a lot as the devoted and loving father of George.  And Paul Rubens pretty much steals every scene he's in as the lush Derek. However, I was (along with everyone else) was disappointed in Penelope Cruz's role.  She did a good job, but the script or story didn't give her much texture to develop her character.  She pretty much appears as the love intrest of George. But that is small potatoes compared to the rest of this excellent film.  I would place BLOW with my libary of great realistic drama DVD's along with GOODFELLAS, CASINO, BOOGIE NIGHTS, DONNIE BRASCO, SCARFACE, and GODFATHER 1 & 2.  And it comes to no surprise that at the ending credits of BLOW, Ted Demme gives special thanks to directors Martin Scorsese and Paul Thomas Anderson.  As you could see they pretty much gave Demme a idea on how to adapt this film. BLOW is a film that we have seen before, but it's always fun to see something similar and new like it.  ***** (out of five)",Null,0,0,11 April 2001
The Iron Giant," A delightful and imaginative family film!
","It's hard to make a family film in the 1990's.  If you do not have the name 'Walt Disney' placed before the title of your family film, it's usually a sure bet that your movie won't make much money in the box office, but the film will do well in the video market.  But every now and then there is a family film that rises out of the juvenile and childish ashes and shines brightly on the faces of both the young and old.  In 1995 Universal released that family film, and it is titled BABE.  In 1997 Fox released their family film titled ANASTASIA, which was both spectacular and fantastic.  Now it's Warner Bros. turn, and their film is called THE IRON GIANT, which isn't only the best family film of the year, but one of the best movies of the year. THE IRON GIANT takes place during the Communist scare of 1957. It's the animated tale of a young boy named, Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal) who is kind, smart, and intelligent.  Hogarth lives with his mom, Anne Hughes (Jennifer Aniston) who is a waitress at the town's popular diner.  One night while Hogarth's mom is working late at the diner, Hogarth is up late at night watching t.v., until the  reception goes bad.  Hogarth sees that the antenna for the t.v. is missing, and there's a trail leading out to the woods.  Out in the woods Hogarth sees a 100 foot tall metal robot that's made of metal, that is at first eating the metal off of a electrical power station, until the robot gets tangled in the power lines and is getting electrocuted.  Hogarth, with sypmathy, turns off the power to the station and saves the robot.  It is then that the young boy and the robot become friends. Meanwhile, one of the fishermen who's boat crashed into the robot while it crashed landed on earth, calls the government and they send over government agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald).  Mansley believes that the robot will pose a threat to the people and sees that it must be found and destroyed.  So Hogarth decides to hide the robot in the town's junkyard run and owned by beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr.).  It's only a matter of time that Hogarth teaches the Iron Robot the ways of life, before agent Mansley finds the robot. Parents complain that Hollywood needs to make more family orientated films.  Well, Waner Bros. (a Hollywood studio) had made the ideal family film, and sad to say, nobody is seeing it. While parent groups are in meetings bashing such films as: MATRIX, WILD WILD WEST, AMERICAN PIE, AUSTIN POWERS 2, and SOUTH PARK; they are guilty of not letting their children watch a great movie like this.  Instead, these 'guilty' parents are letting their children become lab-rabbits and let them be exposed to such adult orientated films as the ones I meantion above, and then go to meetings and rallies to protest the films that shouldn't be viewed by young children.  Or maybe these parents don't really want to see a children's film, and would rather see a film that they would want to see, and bring their children along so they can spend the money on refreshments and not on some baby-sitter. That's a shame, since this is a excellent family film, yet like ANASTASIA, it's not pulling in much money into the box office.  Perhaps it's because that children would rather see talking animals than an animated person, that would explain on why BABE was such a big hit (but please, DO NOT let them watch the upcoming TNT film ANIMAL FARM, that will traumatize kids for years). What I personally liked about THE IRON GIANT is two things: the cute homage to the life-style of the 1950's, and the humor. First the homage, this film really makes a nice and witty look at what life was like in the 50's.  From the cheesy 'Duck & Cover' films, to the witty satire of the sci-fi/horror films. Then there's the humor, where nothing is offensive, but it's still funny and clever.  No wonder, THE IRON GIANT is directed by Brad Bird, who has made some of the funniest animated t.v. shows ever.  Including the AMAZING STORIES episode of 'THE FAMILY DOG,' THE CRITIC, KING OF THE HILL, and my favorite, THE SIMPSONS.  I think Disney is missing out on not having Brad Bird work for them, he would turn Disney's animated films from cutesy to witty, and hopefully less musical numbers. But since THE IRON GIANT, is still playing in the theaters, go take the kids to see it!!!  And if you don't have any kids, go see it anyways!!! I would rather take kids to see this film than INSPECTOR GADGET. The critics would also agree with me, but people don't like to listen to critics.  But it's the critic's that people should listen to when it comes to a family film, since most critics reccommend BABE, ANASTASIA, and THE IRON GIANT. It's a really touching and nice family film that comes out every so often that will entertain both the young and the young at heart. And I forgot to mention, the animation was great!!!!  ***** (out of five)",Null,0,0,8 September 1999
Vanilla Sky," The talented Mr. Crowe.
","Man oh man.  Leave it to Cameron Crowe.  Last year he directed the most whimsical film which was also one of the best movies ever made, (ALMOST FAMOUS).  Now he's directed one of the most thought provoking films ever made, which could also just as well be one of the best films this year, VANILLA SKY.  This is a film that will have you think about what you just saw and the more you take the film apart, the more meaning there is behind the film.  This isn't the same style of Cameron Crowe who directed the crowd pleasing, JERRY MAGUIRE.  This is more like the nightmare of Jerry Maguire. David Aames (Tom Cruise) ownes 51% of a major magazine publishing company, that he inherited from his father.  The other 49% of the company is owned and runed by the seven board members of the company, which David likes to call 'the Seven Dwarfs.'  He is despised by the members as being another 'rich kid who got daddy's business' which has David feel that he is the victim of a conspiracy.  But outside of work, David is flirtatious, he is having an affair with a stunning blonde named Julie (Cameron Diaz).  David feels only lust for Julie, no love.  It isn't until David's best friend, Brian Shelby (Jason Lee) introduces David to Sofia Serrano (Penelope Cruz), that David begins to feel different.  David is attracted to Sofia, but he feels different, he is in love with Sofia, not lust.  And this leads David to realize that Sofia is changing his life, and for the first time in his life, from the flirting with Julie and the pressures at work, David feels great.  Julie sees David is attracted to Sofia and is jealous, she feels that David violated her by treating her like a sex object.  While David is at his peak, Julie is at her downfall, which leads to Julie crashing her car off a bridge with her and David in it.      When David wakes up from his coma after several months, he is living his nightmare.  He is being charged for murder, he is incarcerated, he's seeking psychatric help from Dr. Curtis McCabe (Kurt Russell), and the worst thing is that David's face has been disfigured making him from looking handsome to horrifying.  David's worst nightmares are coming true, which causes David to mentally and physically try to bring his life back to the way it was. VANILLA SKY is a remake of the 1997 film OPEN YOUR EYES.  I haven't seen the original version, but for Crowe's version, it's a very stylish and well made thriller.  Crowe uses his skills to make VANILLA SKY similar to his previous films, with the entertaining dialogue, and excellent romantic chemistry.  You would think that at first VANILLA SKY is another retelling of Crowe's previous work JERRY MAGUIRE.  But then it turns into the darkest of nightmares.  Being disfigured, accussed or murder, the fear of not being in love anymore, being alone, and worst of all, being depressed is the darkest of feelings that any human being could feel.  Crowe makes an impressive turn at turning VANILLA SKY from a cute touch romance, to a intense and depressing thriller. The acting is brought out the strongest by it's star Tom Cruise. Unlike the flamboyance of MAGNOLIA, the anger of BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and the confused JERRY MAGUIRE, David Aames is in a lot of pain.  Cruise does a outsanding job as the man who is suffering from the car accident and realizes that things can't be the way they were.  I also enjoyed the performance by Kurt Russell, who gives a strong acting performance as the doctor who is looking deep inside Cruise's character to see if he can find the answer causing David's pain.  And the support from Penelope Cruz, Jason Lee, and Cameron Diaz are all also good.  The romantic chemistry between Tom and Penelope is fantastic, you can see how they fell in love with each other in reality.  But it's the Oscar worthy performance by Cruise that helps carry the picture. I was also strongly pleased with the music soundtrack that Crowe and wife Nancy Wilson put together for the film.  I was amazed to hear the little known gem by the Monkees 'Porpoise Song (Theme From Head)' being played in the movie.  Like HEAD, VANILLA SKY is similar in style by taking the viewer into a trip that is unforgettable.  And other songs by Paul McCartney (doing the title tune), Peter Gabriel, Stereolab, Chemical Brothers, Bob Dylan, and Spiritualized, is a fantastic soundtrack of mixing classic songs from the 60's with the similar style songs of the 21st century. Then finally there is Cameron Crowe's directing.  He has the viewer keep guessing on what is going on while watching the film until the very end.  It isn't until it's over that you do understand what is going on, and are still amazed by the twist.  And Crowe never does make the film boring, it might be weird or confusing, but never silly or boring.  Crowe also manages to take the film from one mood into another mood without any faults. VANILLA SKY is a film that won't please the Tom Cruise fans who would like to see him do more films like TOP GUN and DAYS OF THUNDER.  Nope, sorry folks, that Tom Cruise has hopefully passed on, this is the Tom Cruise like EYES WIDE SHUT and MAGNOLLIA, the one who does a level texture role and not just the hero.  VANILLA SKY also proves that Cameron Crowe doesn't have to do only romantic comedies to show that he's a brilliant filmmaker, he can do thrillers with a stroke of genius.  For those who like film with intelligence and wit, then don't miss VANILLA SKY, one of, if not the best film of the year!  ***** (out of five)",10,1,2,12 December 2001
Any Given Sunday," Football.
","I was really hoping for ANY GIVEN SUNDAY to be the ultimate football movie.  I really was hoping since it had a great cast (Al Pacino, Dennis Quaid, Cameron Diaz, Jim Brown, James Woods, etc.) and Oliver Stone is a powerful director with such movies as JFK and BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY.  Yet when I saw the movie I realized that Oliver Stone has changed since JFK.  Since NATURAL BORN KILLERS, Stone has taken the audience into a bizarre and twisted world.  A world that some will find brilliant, and others disturbed.ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is the in-depth look of professional football. Eariler this year we experienced high school football (VARSITY BLUES) and now it's time for the pro's.  Al Pacino stars as Tony D' Amato a aging coach who is struggling to get his team into a successful season.  His star quarterback, Jack 'Cap' Rooney is thirty-nine years old, and isn't as healthy as he use to be.  The team owner and manager, Christina Pagniacci (Cameron Diaz) keeps breathing down his neck on why isn't their team winning.  The team doctor, Dr. Harvey Mandrake (James Woods) is switching the medical exams of the players, so they can play.  Yet, Mandrake is endangering the lives of the players.  And to top it off, a young quarterback with a high ego is becomming the star player for the team, Willie Beaman (Jamie Foxx). The trouble is that Beaman is doing his own plays and causing trouble among the team. ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a strong look at the lives of the NFL players.  With money, fame, power, women, women, and more women, you would think that these guys have life made easy, yet they don't.  They have to face aging, younger and stronger players, teammates back-stabbing them, life threating injuries, and players who think that they are the only reason on why the team is doing good. I did enjoy the way the film looked into the lives of these men.  How the coach is under pressure with the team players and management, how the aging quarterback is trying to maintain his image, and how the young rookie is facing the negativity from his teammates.  The acting was very good.  Pacino as usual was great, but he gave a stronger and more passionate performance in THE INSIDER.  Dennis Quaid is always a delight to see, and he does a great job in this film as well. Cameron Diaz is a excellent actress, going from her ditzy role in BEING JOHN MALKOVICH, to her witchy attitude in this film. Jim Brown is always a delight to see, since he was a professional football player. James Woods is always a great slimy and evil person to see, and Matthew Modine is fun to watch as a character who is the opposite of Woods character. And even L.L. Cool J was fun in this film, a lot better than his previous film, DEEP BLUE SEA. But if the film belongs to anyone, it's Jamie Foxx. The rap singer/comedian does a great job and carries the film off well as the new popular quarterback who makes the team stand out.  I think that now, Foxx is going to be getting more juicy roles than he was before thanks to this film.  Foxx does a great job and shows a serious side to his character.  He doesn't overact or show off, he fits the role perfectly. So what did bother me with this film?  Well it was Oliver Stone's directing.  His extreme close ups on a person or a object, I will give him credit, it is original, and it has become a Oliver Stone trademark. But he's been doing it since NATURAL BORN KILLERS, and even directors Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese change their visual style once in a while.  ANY GIVEN SUNDAY would have been perfect had Stone direct the film more like his earlier films, SALVADOR and WALL STREET. Overall, ANY GIVEN SUNDAY is a great film, but it wasn't the classic that I was hoping for it to be.  I was hoping that this was the film that Stone would shock the critcs and tell them that he can still be a great director, like Speilberg did with SCHINDLER'S LIST.  But sadly, this isn't the film, some critcs enjoyed it, others didn't.  This critic did enjoy it, but it isn't the best Oliver Stone film, JFK still holds the title. **** (out of five)",7,0,0,3 January 2000
The Sixth Sense," A surprising masterpiece!
","Sometime Bruce Willis can make some bad films, like HUDSON HAWK and MERCURY RISING.  And other times he can make some films that change the film industry and blow the audiences away (i.e. DIE HARD triology, 12 MONKEYS, and PULP FICTION).  Now Willis' new film, THE 6th SENSE falls in the latter catageory, as a surprising masterpiece that will leave images stuck in your mind for quite sometime. Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist, who is quite good at his job, he has a loving wife named Anna (played by the beautiful Olivia Williams), and he just got awarded by the mayor of Philadelpia for his excellent work.  Then one night, Malcolm gets a terrifying unexpected visit from one of his former patients.  The visit is so terrifying, that it haunts Malcolm later on. Months later, Malcolm's job is going downhill, and his marriage is falling apart.  Then his life is changed around when he meets Cole, a eight year old boy who is considered a 'freak' by everybody but his mom.  Cole is usually alone, scared, and has cuts and bruses on his body.  The doctors and social workers think the injuries come from his mom, Lynn Sear (Toni Collette).  But Lynn loves Cole too much that she wouldn't even think of harming him.  The truth is that the injuries that Cole has are from other people,  people that Cole only sees, people that are dead.  Cole sees dead people walking around with the living, and only Cole sees these ghostly figures.  Malcolm tries to help Cole with his unique gift, and to also find out what these ghostly figures want with him. When I saw the trailers for this movie,  it looked like a o.k. movie. Acutally, the preview didn't have any effect on me at all, as for seeing this film.  But when I saw this film, I was blown away on how excellent this was!  This is a highly entertaining film that is scary, sad, funny, and even touching. The plot is brilliant, it has intellegence, and shows the personalities of the characters well enough that you feel like that you know them after the movie is over.  The acting is also great, Willis does a good job as the doctor trying to help poor Cole.  Toni Collette is also great as the suffering mom who's  very worried and protective over Cole. Oliva Williams is good as well as the suffering wife of the doctor who feels that she's losing her husband more and more everyday.  But the real surprise is Haley Joel Osment, who plays the little boy, Cole.  For a child actor he's excellent!  He shows potential to becomming a great actor in years to come.  He's the next promising child actor that will hopefully do well like Elija Wood and Anna Panquin. Overall, THE 6th SENSE took me by surprised, and I ended up loving this film.  I would have to place this film as one of the best films of the year, as well as for the summer films.  And for a PG13 rated film, it's quite scary!  This is one film that no one should miss!!!  ***** (out of five)",Null,51,68,3 August 1999
The Matrix," Another Sci-Fi Hit!!!!!!
","The 1990's is going to be a memorable year for the Sci-Fi genre.  With films like 'TOTAL RECALL' 'THE FIFTH ELEMENT' 'JURASSIC PARK' 'TERMINATOR 2' 'EVENT HORIZON' and '12 MONKEYS' they were all excellent films that provided imagination, along with plenty of intellengence and excitement.  Now before the Sci-Fi genre hits full throttle (with EPISODE I), you can say the engine is warming up, and it warms up well with THE MATRIX. THE MATRIX is a interesting mix of 'THE FIFTH ELEMENT' '12 MONKEYS' and 'TOTAL RECALL' it's about a computer hacker (Keanu Reeves) who's is inducted into a gang (led by the always wonderful Laurence Fishburne) into realizing what reality is, and what is the mystery behind the MATRIX? What is THE MATRIX?  Ha! I'm not going to tell you, you're going to have to see the movie to find out!  But you'll be pleased when you do see it. The movie does have a lot of imagination, and excitement.  It also have great effects, excellent action scenes, brilliant directing, and decent acting.  Leave it to the Wachowski brothers to make a exciting film.  I am wondering after making BOUND and THE MATRIX, on what they are going to be doing next?  Until then go see this wonderful sci-fi flick.  It will calm down your excitement before May 19th hits.  ****1/2 out of *****",9,0,0,1 April 1999
Heat," A Masterpiece.
","Five years ago to this date, I was pretty tired from working all day at my job at the cinema.  However, I did manage to stay awake for a almost three hour epic that blew my mind away and saw a different way to look at the cinema.  Before this film, the director Michael Mann, has shown the life of crime in THIEF, terror in THE KEEP, suspense in MANHUNTER, and a historical epic with LAST OF THE MOHICIANS.  But Mann's film were going on a upswing, and with HEAT, Mann reached peak level. This is a film that will go down in history.  Granted, it's not as much as a classic as SCHINDLER'S LIST and GOODFELLAS.  But HEAT will give future generations a example of what the world and life style was like in the 1990's.  Where NASHVILLE is for the 70's, and film by John Hughes is for the 80's, HEAT is for the 90's.While living in central Los Angeles for over three months, the images and scenes from HEAT couldn't leave my mind.  Mann did a fabulous job by shooting the film on the actual streets of L.A.  The film shows the dark and gritty world where we are use to the palm trees and beaches.  Mann's L.A. has some fancy art deco buildings mixed in with decaying buildings.  The streets of Koreatown where all the signs are in Korean, the run down coffee shop that is hidden among giant skyscrapers. If anyone wants to know what L.A. really looks like, this is the perfect film that shows the viewer the real world of L.A. There's the brilliant plot.  Some would say that it's a remake of Mann's eariler work, L.A. TAKEDOWN. But Mann took a simple story and turned it into a epic, and that is exactly what HEAT is, a epic.  Multiple characters, multiple stories, different conflicts and situations and adding a blend of fantastic action into it.  I love the way the characters and story works.  Al Pacino playing Vincent Hannah, the lead detective who is tracking down a group of professional thiefs led by Neil McCauley played by Robert DeNiro.  Unlike any other crime-action film that I have seen, HEAT has both the police officers and criminals being highly intelligent!  No bad doughnut jokes, no bumbling crooks, no 'I'm getting too old for this' lines, etc.  The thieves use clever plans to stage and work out a robbery, while the officers use clever actions to identify and gather evidence of the criminals. The look by Dante Spinotti is beautiful.  The L.A. skyline with his famous tint shade of blue makes L.A. look like a million stars in the sky. His shots of the empty apartment that McCauley owes with the Pacific Ocean in the background.  The music by Elliot Goldenthal is also fantastic, it has a techno beat that adds to the suspense and excitement that the film is showing.  But it's the score by famous artist Moby that rises above the rest of the film's music.  With Hannah speeding down Interstate 5 while 'New Dawn Fades' is blasting on the soundtrack, and the magical and beautiful 'God Moving Over the Face of Waters' being played at the ending credits.  Moby was quoted recently that 'God Moving' is his favourite song that he has composed, he says that it brings tears to his eyes whenever he hears it. While I listen to it, the song gives me goosebumps and I can not think of the blue Pacific Ocean with the lights from the L.A. coast. And should I mention the acting, which is the best casting in the history of film.  Not only do you have two of the best actors working right now, DeNiro and Pacino, but here is a small list of who else is in this classic:  Val Kilmer, Jon Voight, Tom Sizemore, Diane Verona, Amy Brenneman, Ashley Judd, Mykelti Williamson, Wes Studi, Dennis Haysbert, Hank Azaria, William Fichtner, Henry Rollins, and Natalie Portman.  If you're going to have two fantastic actors in the lead roles, then you need to have a strong supportive cast with them, and that is what Mann does.  But it's Pacino's and DeNiro's performances are the strong stand-outs.  The scene where Hannah and McCauley are sitting down at a table in a coffee shop is of equal rank as Moses parting the Red Sea in TEN COMMANDMENTS.  Or Indiana Jones running away from the giant boulder in RAIDERS. Yes, these are bold statements to say, but if you have ever been to Los Angeles, you would understand.  And I don't mean the tourist city of Anaheim, I mean the real streets of L.A.  COLORS and BOYZ N' THE HOOD do show a pretty realistic L.A., but it's HEAT that shows the real Los Angeles. This is a film that when you first see it, it's good, but the more you watch it, the more you love it.  That is why I an not going to say to just see this film, but you should buy this film!  Believe me, for the last four years, I've been buying this movie on video or DVD for friends of mine. It's become my own personal chain letter, and every time I give them the movie, they come back telling me they loved it.  Please do yourself a favour, and see this film that is the ultimate image of the last decade of the 20th century. ***** (one of the top 10 films of all time!!!!)",10,9,13,16 December 2000
The Replacements," Funny Football.
","THE REPLACEMENTS is the funniest football film that I have seen since THE LONGEST YARD with Burt Reynolds.  I have always enjoyed movies about sports, in fact I find them more entertaining than the real thing.  Yes, they are predictable, but at least I know who the people are.  You can sort of call this a football version of the baseball classic, THE BAD NEWS BEARS. The professional players of the Washington Sentinels decide to go on strike during the season.  The team owner, O' Neil (Jack Warden) doesn't want the team to quit during mid-season, so he relies on coach McGinty (Gene Hackman) to help find the team some replacement players.  McGinty can find the replacement players, trouble is that each of these players has a excellent quality and a negative quality.  There's Shane Falco (Keanu Reeves), a excellent quarterback who is still living in the shadow of his horrible defeat of the Sugar Bowl game some years ago.  Bateman (Jon Favreau) is a tackle happy defense player, the only problem is that he will also tackle his own teammates.  Gruff (Rhys Ifans) is a excellent kicker, but he has a attitude, drinking, and gambling problem.  And there's Franklin (Orlando Jones) a superior runner, one of the fastest, it's just that he can't catch anything.  McGinty has a few weeks to get this team into the finals, while the strike goes on. I enjoyed the humor of this film, since that is what is important for this film.  It does have some new jokes for the sport, and like I said it's the funniest football film since THE LONGEST YARD and the climax of M*A*S*H*.  And speaking of M*A*S*H*, the cheerleaders led by Falco's love intrest Annabelle (a very pretty Brooke Langton), is the most dinginess and funniest cheerleaders since then. The acting is also fine, I got past the Keanu Reeves slow talking character.  It's not one of his best like PARENTHOOD and MATRIX. But it's far better than MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING and JOHNNY MEMONIC.  Gene Hackman gives a wonderful performance as the football veteran who enjoys his replacements more than his regulars since the replacements play the game for the love of it, not the money.  And I also enjoyed Jon Favreau as the energetic tackle guard who is always excited.  Rhys Ifans is also funny as the 'slobbish' Gruff, if you enjoyed him in NOTTING HILL, you'll enjoy him in this film.  And Faizon Love and Michael Taliferro who play the Jackson brothers are also very enjoyable. This is a decent sports film, director Howard Deutch (of PRETTY IN PINK and GREAT OUTDOORS fame) did a much better job with this film than his previous effort, the dreadful ODD COUPLE II.  And for lightweight summer entertainment, this film does give that to the audience.  This in no INSIDER or AMERICAN BEAUTY, it's just a enjoyable film.  So for those comedy and sport lovers out there, this is a nice treat. **** (out of five)",Null,0,1,2 August 2000
Tarzan," Disney outdo itself, again.
","With their animated films of the 90's, Disney had some great films, 'HUNCHBACK,' 'HERCULES,' and 'BEAUTY & THE BEAST.'  And they had some so-so films, 'ALADDIN,' 'LION KING,' and 'MULAN.'  Now with their newest film, 'TARZAN' you can put this film on the good animated films, as it's one of Disney's best animated film of all time! The film is based on the classic Edward Rice Burrow stories about the young man brought up by a family of apes, since the death of his parents when he was a child. The young child, named Tarzan, spends his young life adapting to accept the difference that he his unlike his adopted parents and his friends because he looks different, and he's hairless. Now Tarzan realizes that their are other creatures that are just like him, and they are humans.  Tarzan saves the life of one of these humans, named Jane. Tarzan realizes that he is not alone in the world, and grows a romantic relationship with Jane.  As Jane also falls in love with Tarzan, and wants to see the world that he was brought up in.  Jane is accompany by her father, Porter, and a evil hunter named Clayton.  While Porter wants to see the apes living habitat.  Clayton wants to capture and kill the apes for a profit. Leave it to Disney to make a wonderful and exciting animated film with a strong message.  With such morals as getting along with different races, supporting animal rights, and preserving the environment.  The voice talent in this film are great.  With talents by Tony Goldwyn, Minne Driver, Nigel Hawthorne, Lance Hernikensen, Brian Blessed, Wyane Knight, and Rosie O' Donnell, they all do a great job of giving the proper voices for thier characters.  But it's the talent and heart of Glenn Close that makes part of this movie a masterpiece.  When she did the voice of the mother of Homer Simpson, you feel that she has the perfect mother figure voice.  Doing the voice of Tarzan's ape mother, you actually don't see her as an ape, but as a caring mother. The other strong aspect of this film is the relationship between Tarzan and Jane.  Their chemistry is the best romance that I have seen since TITANIC.  They really do click together, and you want the both of them to care for each other.  And what makes Jane great is that she is a mixture of a classic lady, and a free spirted modern woman. One surprising thing about this film is that this film is violent!! I was surprised to see so many deaths in this film. It has more deaths than BAMBI!!!  And yet you don't see any of the actual deaths, you do get the idea on what happen, and so would the kids. But don't let that stop you from going to the movie.  Overall, this is an excellent animated film, and of course, it takes Disney to achieve such a wonderful adaptation of the Burrow classic story.  This is one of Disney's best animated films of all time!  Right next to FANTASIA, BEAUTY & THE BEAST, and HERCULES.  ***** (out of *****)",Null,0,0,23 June 1999
Gangs of New York," Best film of 2002!
","I've been admiring Martin Scorsese's films for the last twelve years, ever since I first watched GOODFELLAS.  I've saw his new release films on the big screen since then, and loved them (CASINO, CAPE FEAR, AGE OF INNOCENCE, KUNDUN, & BRINGING OUT THE DEAD).  I would even see re-releases or special screenings of his classics brought back on the big screen (GOODFELLAS, TAXI DRIVER, LAST WALTZ).  In fact it was eariler this year that I watched THE LAST WALTZ for the first time on the big screen, and I noticed the camera shots and techniques that Scorsese used in story films, were also used in a concert film!  Scorsese tried nine years ago to tell accurate peorid piece film of a New York that has been long past with AGE OF INNOCENCE.  He made a great love story with effective performances, yet the pacing was very slow, coming from a man who speaks 175 words a minute. GANGS OF NEW YORK is the latest film that Scorsese has been put on the 'work in progress' list for the last twenty-five years, Scorsese filmed it, it had production nightmares and problems, getting pushed backed several times including the incident of September 11th 2001.  Now after all the wait, negative production press reports, and hype, is GANGS OF NEW YORK a TITANIC, or a HEAVEN'S GATE?  I'm a very pleased to say that from my anticipation and wait, that GANGS is a extradonary film that has the feeling of a successful epic like TITANIC, and not a laughable failure like HEAVEN'S GATE. GANGS OF NEW YORK has a very simple plot, but so do a lot of other great movies.  In 1846, the five points of New York City is  being fought by two gangs who wish to control the area, the Dead Rabbits immigrants lead by Priest Vallon (Liam Nesson) and the native Nativists lead by William Cutting (Daniel Day Lewis) is was called Bill the Butcher.  After the Nativists defeated the Dead Rabbits, killing Priest Vallon, the priest's son Amsterdam, was taken to a orphanage for sixteen years until he was old enough to take care of himself.  Now, the adult Amsterdam (Leonardo Di Capprio) is vowing for the revenge of the death of his father, by killing the man who took his father's life, Bill the Buthcher.  Bill takes a liking of Amsterdam by training him the ways of life around the five points.  The way the gangs steal, the way to kill a man, the corperation of the courrption of politics, and even the most tender and best parts of carving up a pig.  Amsterdam learn all of Bill's traits, but also falls in love with one of Bill's women, Jenny Everdeane (Cameron Diaz).  Jenny makes her living by being a prostitue but earns more of a living by becomming a highly successful pickpocket.  Amsterdam faces the conflict of either to continue to vow the vengence of his father's death, or to live the lifestyle which is better than anything he has ever lived before, with the most ruthless man known. Some people are expecting GANGS OF NEW YORK to be the epic film that answers everything.  Well, it's not a David Lean epic, a Stanely Kubrick epic, or even a Steven Spielberg epic, it's a Martin Scorsese epic.  While I was watching GANGS OF NEW YORK, I couldn't get out of my mind that this is the same film directed by the man who did TAXI DRIVER and ALICE DOESN'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE, and it would have been only those other credits on Scorsese's career, had Scorsese directed GANGS when he wanted to.  But there have been several other films since, RAGING BULL, LAST TEMPTATION OF CHRIST, GOODFELLAS, CASINO, AFTER HOURS. etc.  And this film is the same visionary mind behind those other films. There are scenes where the Scorsese trademark is shown, the obvious scene is when Scorsese has a excellent track shot that shows immigrants coming off of the boat onto the New York pier, only the men to be taken from the U.S. government by drafting them in Union army with a war that they have no idea where or why they are fighting.  A story like that is worthy of a good film alone.  And Scorsese does his 'Hitchcock cameo' in the film by appearing as the head of a weatlhy family household. But there are other scenes in GANGS that I was amazed to be watching on the screen.  There were scenes of astonishing beauty with the creation of the sets of the dilapidated New York and the descriptive lifestyles of a New York resident of the 1860's.  The long shot of the fighting match on a river raft showing steamships and sail ships towering over the people and buildings.  The detailed costumes of the immigrants, the natives, and the high class ellite. Then there is the acting.  DiCapprio does a decent job as Amsterdam, but he wasn't' as enjoyable to watch in this film, as he was in CATCH ME IF YOU CAN (he was much better in that film).  Cameron Diaz was good as Jenny, showing that she is a actress trying to break out of the 'pretty face' roles of CHARLIE'S ANGELS and SWEETEST THING and taking on complicated roles like GANGS and VANILLA SKY.  I also enjoyed the supporting roles of Jim Broadbent as the corrupt politician who associates with the gangs, Henry Thomas as another street gang member who wishes to win the heart of the popular Jenny, John C. Reilly as a corrupt and twisted officer who feels that he has a upper hand of the five points only by being a police officer, Liam Nesson as the heroic and influenal priest, and Brendan Gleason as the man who knows more about the priest's past than Amsterdam knows. But who does the film belong to, who stands out of the entire cast? Daniel Day Lewis gives his best performance of his career in this film, and yes, I'm including his role in MY LEFT FOOT.  I haven't seen a villian so twisted, human, and likeable since Henry Fonda's character of Frank in ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.  Lewis' role of Bill the Butcher isn't as showy as Hannibal Lecture, or over the top like the overrated Denzel Washington role of TRAINING DAY.  If Denzel won a Oscar last year for TRAINING DAY, then Daniel Day Lewis should win a Oscar for this role.  There have been several good performances this year, Tom Hanks in ROAD TO PERDITION, Adam Sandler in PUNCH-DRUNK LOVE, George Clooney in SOLARIS, and Hugh Grant in ABOUT A BOY. But I couldn't believe that all of those performances would be overshadowed by the performance given by Daniel Day Lewis.  Lewis' performance as the one eyed butcher shows the audience the early stages of the mafia boss.  Where we are use to the modern mobster boss image of Robert DeNiro in UNTOUCHABLES, Marlon Brando in GODFATHER, and James Gandolfini in SOPRANOS, Lewis is along the same class of actors and images of a powerful crime boss. Lewis gives the role of Bill the Butcher more human traits and personality than any villian I have ever seen.  Having a fondness of cutting meat, upholding his part of controlling the laws, and ruling his area of the five corners with his iron fist.  People need to realize that the character of Bill the Butcher is the early stages of the now known mafia boss, a man who has a lot of power, and supports his people by giving the needy meat or money.  Bill's mafia like presence and attitude in shown early when he criticizes Amsterdam by not 'presenting' Bill with any valuables or gifts. To me, I say a film characters work if the villian is just as good or more effictive than the hero.  The role of Bill is so powerful and effective that it is among the best villians in the history of cinema.  Would I like to see Lewis win a Oscar?  YEAH!  You bet!  But I think the character of Bill will be better rewarded as being a memorable character like Hannibal 'the Cannibal' Lecture, and Forrest Gump (yet those are Oscar winning roles also). From looking at the images, performances, and story of GANGS OF NEW YORK, I can easily say that it is my favorite film of 2002.  I've been waiting for this film for the last two years, and I am so relieved to say that it was worth the wait.  I watched the film with seven other people who's taste in films are all different than my own.  After the lights went up, all of us were applauding and cheering saying how that was one darn well made film!  One person commented a flaw that bothered her, the editing. She said that it made the film too 'choppy' making things not fully explained. Yet I told her that the film was originaly over three hours and for this being close to three hours, the film seemed like a hour long.If the Academy is awarding directors who haven't gotten a Oscar yet, like what a lot of people said about Ron Howard last year (although I thought he deserved it), then why not give Scorsese his Oscar.  Scorsese should have gotten his oscar twelve years ago when he did GOODFELLAS, but it went to Kevin Costner instead with the overrated DANCES WITH WOLVES.  The buzz has been going around for the last several months that Scorsese might get his long awaited Oscar with this film.  And I say that I would rather see Scorsese get his Oscar with a amazing film like GANGS OF NEW YORK, than good but not great films like AGE OF INNOCNECE or KUNDUN.  How does GANGS on my personal view rank on Scorsese's career?  For me, it's not as good as GOODFELLAS or CASINO, but I thought it was better than RAGING BULL and TAXI DRIVER.  I know that's a very big bold statement to make, but I stand by that, and ask me again in a year or ten years, and I'll still stand by it. Scorsese put a lot of work and effort into this film, it shows, and he succeeded.  Academy Members:  Give Mr. Scorsese his Oscar!  This is the best film of the year!  ***** (out of five)",10,0,0,21 December 2002
Gladiator," Speculator!
","Leave it to Russell Crowe, one of the few actors who actually reads a script for a movie before acting in it.  He has been in two of some of the best movies of the 1990's, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER.  Now Crowe proves his marquee star status with his latest film, GLADIATOR.  GLADIATOR is a film in the tradition of BEN HUR, EL CID, and TEN COMMANDMENTS, a classic epic brought into the new millennium. The story is about Maximus (Russell Crowe), a Spanish general fighting for the powerful Roman army.  He is hailed a hero among his soldiers, and admired by his leader, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).  Marcus adores Maximus so much that he would rather see Max, than his own son, Commodus (Jouquin Phoenix) become the future leader of Rome.  Commodus is both hurt and angered by his father's decision, he kills his father, imprisions Maximus, as well as threatens and torments his beautiful sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen).  Maximus escapes Commodus soldiers and discovers that his family is killed and his home is destroyed by Commodus' army. Maximus is then captured and is sold into slavery to become a gladiator, under the rule of Proximo (the late Oliver Reed).  Maximus befriends another slave, Juba (Djimon Hounsou), and together along with Lucilla, and Roman senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi), they try to defeat the evil rule of Commodus. From start to finish, GLADIATOR is a feast to the eyes and brain.  This is the kind of film that snaggs a couple of Oscar nominations.  Ridley Scott not only proves that he can make a fantastic movies that are in the future (ALIEN & BLADE RUNNER) but also the past, with this film.  From start to finish, and over 150 minutes, Scott manages to makes this film entertaining. With the excellent cinematography, editing, and fight scenes, Scott makes this a unique film placed in the history of cinema. And the acting is also great.  Russell Crowe is excellent, as usual, in his leading role as the faithful and honorable Maximus.  Now maybe, Crowe will become a popular star that he deserved to be since QUICK & THE DEAD.  And Jouquin Phoenix is very vicious and cold as the evil Commodus.  He proves that he can live up to the status that his older brother was in.  Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris are both great as the royal family. And in his final role, Oliver Reed is great as Proximo, the former gladiator who fight his way to freedom. GLADIATOR is a film that both the young and old will enjoy. The old will enjoy it since it's in the same formula as the classic epic film is, and with the great acting.  And the young will enjoy it because of it being so bloody and violent.  But anyone who enjoys brain food with thier summer films will enjoy this film.  Don't miss it!  ***** (out of five)",8,0,0,15 May 2000
High Fidelity," In the top five of Cusack's best films.
","HIGH FIDELITY is a film that asks the question 'why?' when a relationship breaks up.  It shows on why is it when a man loves a woman, then only to have a woman show up with another man, making the previous man heart-broken.  I know how he feels, there are times when I find that one girl that I find special, then the girl tells me that there's another man in her life, and I always wondered what the girl was doing when I wasn't around her. In the new Stephen Frears, the character of Rob Gordon (John Cusack) is pondering and asking himself on what is wrong with him, where did things go wrong?  Rob just broke up with Laura (Iben Hjejle) and Rob tells Laura that he isn't even hurt, that her break-up didn't even make his top five of his most painful break-ups.  Then Rob tells the viewers his most painful break-ups in the past.  One is the striking beautiful Charlie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who left Rob for a handsome model.  The other is Sarah (Lili Taylor) who leaves Rob for another friend that she had.  Rob wacks his brain and is searching for the reason on where did he go wrong in life to have these women break up with him. Rob doesn't really get any help from his co-workers at the used record store that he owns.  There's Dick (Todd Louiso) a shy and timid man who is the sensitive man in the story.  Then there is Barry (Jack Black) the wild and arrogant man who only likes to help customers who listen to good music. While at the store, Rob is wondering on why the girls keep leaving him, Barry keeps picking his top five different categories of music.  From top five 'side 'A' songs' to top five 'death songs.' So Rob goes on his own personal trek to find the big mystery on what went wrong with his past relationships. The trouble is that time is running out for Rob, since Laura has just moved in with her neighbor Ian (Tim Robbins), a spirtual yuppie who believes in inner-peace. Well, like every other reviewer, I'm going to give you my top five reasons on why to see HIGH FIDELITY: 1.) JOHN CUSACK- he is one of the best actors working in Hollywood today.  He is so energentic and convincing at times that you can understand his frustration.  This is one of Cusack's best films, I would say his top five films are: 1.)GRIFTERS  2.)SAY ANYTHING 3.)BEING JOHN MALKOVICH 4.)BETTER OFF DEAD 5.)HIGH FIDELITY  And just like Cusack's character in BETTER OFF DEAD, Lane Myer, he goes through the entire movie thinking about what went wrong. 2.) REALITY OF CHARACTERS- the people portrayed in this film are pretty much the people that you would see on the street.  There is the wild and roudy person like Barry, the quiet and timid Dick, the goddess like person who stands above everyone Charlie, the spritual and inner-seeking self help yuppie Ian, and the sensitive and gentle Laura. 3.) REALITY OF SITUATIONS- the way you see the events happen in this movie seem like it can happen in real life.  Like a man seeking his problems in life, and how many albums can the store sell if they play the music through the store. 4.) SUPPORTING CAST- the supporting cast in the film is great!  Jack Black is funny and wild as Barry, Todd Louiso is also good as the sensitive Dick, Joan Cusack is also enjoyable as Liz, who tries to help Rob, and Iben Hjejle is impressive in her American debut as the girl the Rob wants back. 5.) THE FOCUS ON MUSIC- being the younger brother of a serious music lover, this film does talk about music!  The music topics range from the soul and blues hits from the 60's. The classic hits in the early 70's, the techno pop hits of the 80's like Echo and the Bunnymen and Jesus and Marychain. And the English hit bands of the 90's such as The Beta Band and Stereolab.  I was very pleased to hear and discussion about serious music, instead of music that is only played on hit radio stations, and music that is by a popular artist from the past who is still making new music. I did enjoy HIGH FIDELITY a lot, it's not a laugh a minute comedy like the ads make it out to be.  Word of advice: never believe what the ads show you for a movie, you'll either be disappointed or surprised on the movie.  FIDELITY is a good romantic drama with some nice comic bits thrown in.  Like Cusack's other great romantic/drama SAY ANYTHING, this is a film that will be talked about and mention in years to come. What also surprises me is how did Stephen Frears direct a movie that is so similar to my older brother's life, fascinating. ****1/2 (out of five)",Null,0,1,31 March 2000
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Joel & Ethan's Odyssey.
","There are two sides to film directors Joel & Ethan Coen.  There is the dark and suspenseful side which they showed in BLOOD SIMPLE and FARGO. Then there is the goofy and wacky side displayed in RAISING ARIZONA and HUDSUCKER PROXY.  With thier new film, O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? the Coen Brothers use the wacky and silly road in telling a modern version of Homer's classic poem, 'The Odyssey.'  And the Coen's use their trademarks throughout this film, from the comical and amazing stunts to John Turturro. Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney) is a prisoner in the state of Mississippi during depression 1930's.  Ulysses is a man who takes good care of his hair with 'Dapper Dan' hair grease and wearing hair nets while sleeping, and has a rather unusual intellect for a prisoner in the 1930's. Ulysses decides to break free from work detail one day bringing along his two chainmates, Pete (John Turturro) and Delmar (Tim Blake Nelson).  Where Ulysses is smart, Pete is arrogant, and Delmar is not too bright.  Ulysses convinces his mates to escape from prison to seek the pile of gold that Ulysses hid before getting sent to jail. They first run into a blind prophet on a handcart who predicts that the three men will be going on a great journey on their way back home. While on their way back to Ulysses' homestead, they have the same encounters that the character of Ulysses encountered in 'The Odyssey.' Like 'Odyssey' Ulysses, Pete, and Delmar encounter Sirens, a criminal being George 'Babyface' Nelson, a godess turning one of them into a frog, Zeus (as Governor Pappy O' Daniel), Cyclops (Big Dan Teague), suitors, and even Charybdis.  All of these enconters led for Ulysses to see his soon to be ex-wife Penny (Holly Hunter) before she marries a crooked suitor and taking their seven daughters with her. The very enjoyable thing about O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU? is comparing this film to The Odyssey.  Having been 'force read' Odyssey in high school, I understood the 'inside jokes' that Joel and Ethan Coen put into this film for the modern telling of the thousands of years old poem. If Hollywood filmmakers like Baz Lurhman can do modern version of William Shakespeare's ROMEO & JULLIET, then why can't the Coen's do Odyssey?I also did enjoy the acting in this film.  George Clooney proves that he is not only a cool actor, but also funny and good!  He makes Ulysses a character what Pete calls, 'a big mouth smart aleck.'  Ulysses is a man who doesn't believe in faith, but believes in coindences and luck instead. While Pete and Delmar who Ulysses calls, 'dumber than a bag of hammers,' do believe in faith and superstition, which makes Ulysses either egotistical or intelligent or perhaps both. And Tim Blake Nelson is also very enjoyable as the not too bright Delmar who is usually in the middle of the arguments between Ulysses and Pete, and who does believe in old fashion superstition.  And the other actors, from John Turturro, Charles Durning, John Goodman, Holly Hunter, and Michael Badalucco all deliver good performances as well. But two things stand out with O BROTHER, first is the bluegrass music, it's outstanding!  There are lots of classic songs that are depression era time that is played on the soundtrack of the film.  But the modern written 'Man of Constant Sorrow' which is sung by Ulysses, Pete and Delmar as the 'Soggy Bottom Boys' is the best song that will have you humming as you leave the theater.  And the directing by Joel Coen is also very well done, with great pacing, some very amusing scenes, and wacky characters makes O BROTHER a splendid comedy. In the Year in Review 2000 issue of Entertainment Weekly, film critic Owen Gilbertman said that O BROTHER was the 'Worst Movie of 2000.'  The worst?  More worse than other terrible movies with the likes of READY TO RUMBLE, BIG MOMMA'S HOUSE, SUPERNOVA, NEXT BEST THING, and the dreaded BATTLEFIELD EARTH?  I think Mr. Gilbertman either had obnoxious people sitting next to him, or had a bad hangover from a party the night before while watching O BROTHER at the Cannes Film Festival.  How could this very enjoyable and wacky film be bad?  Yet he give a movie like CHARLIE'S ANGELS a 'B' for being trashy, yet fun?  At least film critic Roger Ebert gave O BROTHER another chance before giving a final review, to saying that some scenes were good, but not good enough to recommend.  I think Mr. Gilbertman should pick up a copy of 'The Odyssey' and realize the similarites between the film pieces of art. But there are still plenty of big and small named critics who praise O BROTHER, and it's even nominated for Best Picture (Comedy/Musical) for Golden Globes.  And after watching this movie I can see why.  It's the Coen's doing their Dr. Jekyl filmmaking, the lightweight fun and goofy side of a story.  But some critics and Coen fans prefer the Mr. Hyde vision of the Coens, with dark and moody.  But whether you enjoy wacky films or just the Coens in general (like me) then O BROTHER will please you a great deal, with you humming the songs from the soundtrack on the way home.  ***** (out of five)",10,0,0,18 January 2001
