The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," It's too slow
","It was very slow compared to the rest of the series.I was really impressed about how they pulled of Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting.Overall(this is my first review) it was an OK movie.I loved The Hunger Games and Catching Fire.I have read the books and to be completely fair, they never followed the book at all. The acting is a (10/10) but the plot was like a (6/10)I gave this movie a (5/10) because there was a fair amount of drama, but not enough action. I was sort of expecting something a little more actiony(not a word) but i guess they are saving it up for part 2.",5,4,6,2 April 2015
