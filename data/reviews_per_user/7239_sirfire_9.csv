The Hangover," If you are young and take drugs its for you!
",What a boring contrived piece of crap!This is not for kids and yet it was written for the immature or teenage audience. Zach Galifianakis is the most un-funniest person with the acting ability of a silent movie actor who just learned they have talkies available. Pissing on the floor and chucking a used condom around is not funny its frankly predictable and boring. The only good performance was that of Ed Helms but even his acting ability couldn't save the script that could have been so much better based on a half decent idea. I would have punched 'Alan' until his brains splattered all over the ground and I would have tasered Phil's balls until they burst into flames before l could be happy about watching these losers in a movie.Do not let teenagers watch this movie!,1,5,9,22 July 2011
Hostel," Not your average flick!
","First of all let me start off by saying they promoted this movie in Australia as another Tarantino flick which put me in the mood for something completely different to a non-humor horror flick.After the credits where read I realized that he was just an executive producer and Eli Roth was the director. I blame myself for not looking into it more being a movie buff and all.I'm not a great horror movie fan as most horror flicks don't really work, as one person mention I haven't been scared since Alien was made. Gore doesn't really work unless you feel like the characters this doesn't mean that you need to be like them but know someone who is similar which worked in Hostel.Many would have complained about the soft porn and I agree but it was to put you in the picture of young boys who will be easily seduced by the thought of easy sex in Europe and the people who live in Europe where taking advantage of this by showing them what they wanted to see.One of the Hero's was clearly a mummies boy and frankly I was glad died the hardest he was homophobic, and he was making a point that he was a prude and yet he wanted the cheap sex and arrogance of being an American. He was perhaps a sterotype American and to the non-American's of the world they could identify that type of character, I was sort of scared that he would be the sole survivor as in other movies of a similar nature but I was glad it was not the case.The horror was perhaps too strong for many but I agree it wasn't labored on and when you look around at horror films I found it hard to find anything that was scary enough to make me move and yes this film scared me and moved me so the goal was achieved.I think that the last 'victim' had a great twist and instead of all the movies where he manages to escape and the police save the day it was good to see someone getting revenge for a change, most movies are fairly predictable I guess this wasn't one of them.As art which it should be seen as, I liked it overall perhaps I wasn't in the mood for this type as they promoted it as something it wasn't. Eli Roth picked good cast of not so well known actors and it was good to see ladies where not just the pretty bodies but had an important role to play.To a point too much sex strong gore but if they didn't do it the movie wouldn't have worked, the eye scene was fantastic. I'm not a great Hollywood fan as I guess you could see with my comments, if you tried to tone this movie down wouldn't be even a decent bad movie, but if they did tone it down it would really just allow others to bag it as another boring Hollywood movie.",6,0,0,8 March 2006
Begin Again," Entertaining
","Enjoyable movie that highlights the art of music and how it is a fundamental key to ever lasting memories.The title is strange as I personally thought the story with two completely contrasting situations, one washed up music executive who was still trying to bring art to the masses and a talented shy music writer who couldn't portray the songs she was writing to an audience due to her inability to break her introverted shell.What impressed me the most was the desire to bring the raw sounds to the an album so it has the 'real' feel to it, in some cases it was a tad contrived but that made good entertainment. There is a tad Lorde, Sia and Angus and Julia Stone to it and if thats not your cuppa tea then you will not only not like the movie. So this is where it is all at the music, I loved Adam Levine music and overall the soundtrack was original and sensational.Some of the acting could have improved, however it didn't stop me from enjoying this movie.Simple story .... great music .... nice casting, so its a 7.5 which means i recommend you spend some of your time to see.",7,1,2,8 February 2015
Empire of the Sun," Truly thought provoking!
","I cannot fathom why so many hated this in their reviews, however I feel that it maybe they just wasn't interested enough to understand or patience. It starts out as a upper class British family with a spoilt single child in this big home in Shanghai. The story is about this child who bullied his Chinese servants to do his deeds for them when all they wanted was to teach him good (don't know how this could be contrived to be racist or calling Chinese stupid as other reviewers suggest). All he wanted to do was to fly. Now some people got confused about his fascination with Japanese planes but they need to understand that he was born in China he never saw another airplane so he didn't know any better in fact he never been outside of China as i understand the story.There was a clear example of this when a former Chinese servant woman gave what that young boy truly deserved a good 'ol fashion smack.... many people said he was obnoxious and he was early but then he had to quickly change his ways just to survive. This movie shows that no one is winners in war and just how hard it would have been for a child to survive.The madness of war was creeping in and the emotions of each character was all there to be seen and it didn't treat the audience like idiots (perhaps it should have treated them simple as for some people just don't get his love for Zeros) If I could get my kids to watch it and really see it for what it is, perhaps they might learn something.I didn't see racism and I saw the good and the bad of all humans .... it was sad to see these fine young Japanese flyers go on their last flight for country.BTW what was it about so many asked???.... SURVIVAL!",9,4,9,17 May 2011
Burn After Reading," Expectations should be erased!
",I like the Coen brothers movies and they are all uniquely different and expectations are always going to be an issue so if you would like to see a good comedy without cheesy one liners that looks back on society and people of today Burn After Reading is for you. If you like comedians like 'Chris Lilley' who does 'Angry Boys' and 'Summer Heights High' you will like this movie. If you like 'Two and Half Men' or HotTub Time Machine you won't! That is not to say these shows aren't good it is just a different type of humour. Forget about what you have seen with Coen Brothers and satisfaction will be high or at least higher than these critics posted. Spoilers from here.... Now for the people who did see it but don't like it. Yep it didn't have CGI or one crack up liners but what a funny movie that was not only enjoyable but unique. I think the biggest problem was people do not like looking back at the mirror as no one likes seeing who they really are! We have the health nut that has those silly health drinks who says 'that's the stuff' and rides his push bike to the drop off... then smooth talker who claims he has a big job with a big GUN but has never fired it before. Plus the guy who is in love with his fellow worker who does anything for her but she cannot see past her own vanity to see him. And then the final part was a crack up .... 'What did we learn from this?' Normal people acting like gangsters without having a clue about what they are doing. Sure it's not a classic but it is a time piece and one day you might look back and smile.,9,3,5,29 July 2011
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," CGI Brilliant .... Entertainment only in the graphics!
","First of all i didn't see the whole movie as i started to get annoyed with the Characters who all but one where not likable. I mean really only one human being is likable and really in a cheesy way and you can see how this movie was going to turn and i thought wow love the images but even I would rise up and kill every idiot human being in the world. The most stupid thing is while you can give evolution to the apes they don't become 'instantly' brilliant intelligent and the humans in this story are the most idiotic, moronic and just plain bad. I know we all wanted to root for the apes and hell i wouldn't stop evolution to wipe out the human race for what they have done on this planet but i wanted a believable script and you can do it and believable CGI action at the end. To explain in brief i did fast forward the middle as it was slow predictable to just see the end and boy i was glad i did as the ending was as moronic as the humans in this movie. They had 1 chopper and twenty or 30 police men vs 100 or so Apes the odds were clearly in the Apes favour not to mention how bullet proof these animals are .... and simply beat these 30 or so police me they are free to destroy billions of humans as the dumb humans run away. Oh BTW being intelligent and learning how to make a perfect hangman's noose is about as believable as the Kardashian's having a University degrees.",1,3,8,2 January 2012
Taken," Oh boy did they get this wrong.
","Being a white Anglo Saxon Australian, even i feel the racism and stereo-typing dripping this movie and clearly the other reviews agree.I found it hard to enjoy when so much ignorance was displayed and frankly left perceptions about travelling overseas is really like.The story is in fact very predictable but fun to watch if you can get over the clich√© riddled lines and while the action was IMO brilliant it is very violent and should never have been PG-13.However this could have been a good movie if care had of been taken in thinking outside of Americans. Sure they tried to make the French, Arabs and Albanians all evil but if they stopped the 'foreigners is evil' and just had baddies and more common sense this movie might have done better.not for kids.",3,5,17,9 March 2010
The Blind Side," The review of all the reviews!
","Okay let me get this right! The Republicans are insulted, the African Americans are insulted and the do gooders are insulted and the raw nitty gritty tell us the truth are insulted! Why is this so? It is pretty easy to explain really .... you see the story was always going to divide people in itself but the producers tried to run this down the middle IE not too left or right and as we all know it's human nature that if it doesn't sit politically correct in your head you are not going to be happy. Now here is my take on the story. Irrespective of the white folks intentions and would they do it if he wasn't a potentially going to be a football star this movie shows (even with its Walt Disney feel) that people can do good and that they should do good. Society is a difficult problem with no simple answers, for example here in Australia we don't do enough to help the indigenous people and yet they get upset if you do help them as they would like to do it on their own terms. I fully agree with them but this doesn't mean you should let a young children live on the streets or that we don't provide assistance. The reality is not every aboriginal is disadvantage but there is a high majority of them who are. This is where people need to think outside the square and not take offense to the stereo typing and appreciate the particular people's story. You see most white southern people are republicans and most Africans Southern Americans are living below the poverty line. I personally find it offensive that people who live in New York or Germany find it offensive when they do not take into account the particular person situation and they are in fact generalising their assumptions based on his/hers location and situations. It is also a fact that not every person has the chance to go to university of their choice without the right criteria. Do you think that every Harvard university student wants to be a lawyer or doctor because of their own goals or ideas? Many of these students are driving by parent's goals and dreams and if they have the resources then so be it. Michael had a chance to do something in his life that would give him future. I sure as hell don't want to work at my job every week but i do it and i am sure that I am not the only person who feels like that..... but life gives us all choices and Michael took his .... right or wrong Michael is a lucky man.Good story but could have been better, however it has good acting and it is well worth a look.",Null,0,2,4 September 2011
Moonrise Kingdom," Majority wins
",I loved the 1960's and I loved the direction of this movie. At first I was taken back and it started more like a clip from a song but that was its style. The photography was brilliant and I like how you had to work out what it was all about. Perhaps they could have simplified it and added more words but to me that would have ruined it. I liked the innocence of the two stars first love and it makes you think back to your first kiss or talking to a girl or boy. All the kids acted exactly how kids react. It was dark humor and when mix that with the age of the stars it is controversial. I thought those days are long gone as it seems today talking about your first love or children thinking about love is a taboo but I am glad they still do movies in all parts of life.... from being born .... growing up .... being teenager to middle age and of course growing old.True there will be haters and i understand that but the majority wins .... and i am glad more liked it than not.,10,1,3,30 June 2013
