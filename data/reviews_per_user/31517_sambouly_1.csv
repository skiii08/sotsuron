Requiem for a Dream," Darren Aronofsky you are the genius
","this is easily the best movie that I've ever seen and probably will ever see. I don't know how many times I've seen this movie. it has been times that I watch this movie everyday for a week. first of all the story is so chilling that you may never want to try hard drugs ever again after seeing what these people went through and what they had to do to get the drugs and just to live. even though its a fiction, but it can easily be reality. even if u don't like the story and think its to depressing and hard to watch, still the art and talent that went in to this movie is beyond anything that I've seen before ( and I see A LOOOOOOOOTTTTTT of movies, and I study film). the editing is amazing, they show everything without showing anything, I know its hard to imagine but u just have to watch it. the music is perfect and is the best original score for a movie so far. maybe the most surprising thing about this movie is Marlon Wayans, who knew he could be so serious and good. to me this movie is just perfect and I don't understand why it got only one Oscar nomination without any wins. 10 out of 10.",10,2,4,25 June 2006
