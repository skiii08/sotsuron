The Avengers," Essentially a dumb, loud, explosive action film, but a dumb, loud explosive action film done well.
","I had my reservations about Avenger Assemble for a long time- it is not my sort of film. The only previous films in the saga I saw before this were Iron Man (which I didn't like) and Captain America (which I did). What made Captain America for me was that it was interesting that is was set against the backdrop of world war II, and the redeeming feature of Iron Man was the witty dialogue between Robert Downey Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow. So the task is, how do they make a film with all of these stars, with so much back-story, set in the modern era, without it turning into Iron Man 2.5 (which it does in places), that lives up to the MASSIVE hype? Let's face it, since the film has been building up people's expectations for that long and with so many huge stars competing for screen time and the best dialogue it was never going to be anything but a little bit of a mess. What it is though is an enjoyable mess. They don't go down the route of the Transformers films (Revenge of the Fallen in particular) and just spend 2 hours making 2 dimensional robot characters smash each other up. Avengers Assamble is enjoyable because of the characters involved. It is to its advantage that the back-stories for most of the main characters have been established already, it means that we can just get on with the film and not spend to much time discussing the wherefores and the hows. It is also good that despite having only seen 2 of the previous 5 films I was able to understand perfectly well what was going on the film. The story is very simple and not at all confusing (unlike Transformers ROTF) and requires very little thinking. If you do take anytime to actually think about the film it is clearly just a 'slot A into tab B' affair- very predictable and formulaic- but if you take it for what it is and enjoy the ride it is very entertaining. It is the characters that make the film. Unlike the Transformers films the characters are all unique and well rounded. They all seem to have their own part to play (apart from Black Widow, who aside from looking good and being the token female seems to have nothing to do and no real superpowers). It does turn a little into Iron Man 2.5 at times, after all it is clear he has the best powers and Robert Downey Jr. is the biggest star so it is hard not too. Some of his lines do get a little less witty and a little more silly at times but it is never really too much of a problem. Each character does have their part to play and it was interesting watching their interplay on screen. The film as a whole was nothing more than a formulaic affair, going from confrontation to confrontation without much to link it together, but this is not really a problem. It relies heavily on special effects, which is OK since they work well in the context of the film. The final huge CGI fest that was the end battle was done very well, with each character getting a similar amount to do (with the exception of Black Widow) and it was consistently interesting (unlike the climaxes of the Transformers films which were just dumb smash 'em up's for an hour). I do take issue with one thing though- a tiny amount of CGI in the climax battle was quite poor (Scarlett Johansson flying on the hover-bike thing)- almost unforgivable in a film that relies to heavily on special effects and which has such a big budget. The actors do a great job, for me Mark Ruffalo stealing the show with his unhinged, unstable Banner, though Tom Hiddleston was great too. It is this that makes the film so watchable. Without such interesting characters the film would just be a big dumb mess. In the end the film is nothing more than formulaic but a very well done formulaic film. The director Whedon clearly knew exactly what he was doing at every scene of the film. I think it is very commendable that with the amount of hype surrounding the film and the number of stars competing in the film that he has formed anything other than a complete mess. When it comes down to it Avengers Assemble is an enjoyable film, made so by the characters and the actors portraying them. It is very funny at times and surprisingly never boring. It's not particularly clever but it know's how to appeal to a wide audience and fans alike and it is an achievement.",8,3,9,10 May 2012
Ali," Heartfelt, brutal, emotional
","This is a good film, i enjoyed it a lot. One of the main problems however is that although Will Smith gives one of his best performances (with the possible exception of Chris Gardner in The Pursuit of Happiness) it still looks and feels like I'm simply watching Will Smith as Muhammed Ali. This wouldn't be a big problem if it weren't for the fact that this is supposed to be about a real-life character. I think the problem lies in the fact that Will Smith is too famous to be given a role like this, it should have been given to an unknown so that most of the film isn't spent watching Will Smith as Ali but someone who we don't know as Ali because this would have been more convincing already. It is a good film though, set in rough times for ethnic minorities in the US. You can really feel the emotion, especially during Ali's downfall, and comeback. The best scene is Smith running through the streets of Kinshasa, Zaire before Rumble in the Jungle, followed by kids shouting his name. Does go on a bit too long though.",8,1,2,26 August 2009
50 First Dates," Not bad as far as rom-coms go
","Not the ordinary Adam Sandler film. Those who don't like Adam Sandler in things like Anger Management or Happy Gilmore might prefer him in this, he's less of an idiot. Its more relaxing than some of his other films and actually has an interesting plot. I don't generally like Drew Barrymore, though again she's actually OK in this. It is quite funny in parts and you can actually feel the emotion of Sandler's character in the predicament he find himself, through no fault of his own. It's worth watching just for the interesting plot, and it doesn't go on for too long, like a lot of romantic comedies can. I liked it, which I was surprised at, not the sort of film I'd normally watch, but enjoyable.",7,0,0,24 August 2009
Catch Me If You Can," Very entertaining, and quite clever at the same time
","I was really surprised when I saw this. I wasn't expecting it so be so good. First of all the story is really interesting and really entertaining at the same time- something very rarely seen these days. Secondly, the performances are excellent, Leonardo DiCaprio in this sort of role where he actually acts instead of just looking pretty (Titanic springs to mind) is really a joy to watch. Also, Christopher Walken is excellent and Tom Hanks does that thing that he does which is to pull off an extremely good performance without actually trying. Lastly, I just want to say the music was brilliant- I'm really a big fan of John Williams. So, when it all comes together this really is a joy to watch, it's emotional, emotional, funny, witty, and very clever. An refreshingly not too long.",8,2,3,13 April 2010
Gravity," One of the most beautiful experiences of any art form. Unlike anything I have ever seen
","I wasn't sure really what to expect from Gravity. I did have high expectations and it's clear from Alfonso Cuaron's last film Children of Men that he is an exciting director and makes interesting films. Gravity is way beyond that. It is unlike anything I have ever seen. At heart it is a film about an individual's endurance and shear will to survive, nothing we haven't seen before, but it's the almost perfect execution that makes this film a masterpiece. First of all, this is a visual film. Every visual element comes together like cogs so that the finished product looks (and feels) extraordinary. The way the camera moves (pace, directionality, the way the focus shifts), the way the film is lit, the set pieces, all add up to what is visually speaking the film equivalent of an opera. And I never thought I'd say this but the 3D makes up one of those cogs, sometimes not quite moving in quite close harmony with the others, but very rarely was that the case. 3D for me has rarely been immersive, and never would I have described an entire 3D film as being that, until now. Rarely does a shot look noticeably out of focus, such is the norm with 3D. The vast, vast majority only adds to the beauty and wonder of the overall visual experience. Cuaron gets 3D, the slow-moving shots allow for an adjustment of focus that is seamless. In fact I'd go as far as to say that to see the film in 2D would be to miss a large part of what makes the film so stunning. Secondly, while I'll admit that the plot itself and dialogue are perhaps clunky at best, I didn't care. The lack of any sort of plot isn't an issue, the film is following the character on a short journey and as explained above you really do feel like you're right there, in space, watching. There are plenty of films where there is a lack of narrative. That is not an issue. The dialogue in this film needs to serve only as a commentary on what is going on, to fill in any blanks, which I'll admit people may have a problem with, and it does get a little cheesy. I didn't care. I was rarely listening to what was being said. I was more interested on what I was watching, yes the stunning visuals, but also the plight of the character, which was enthralling. Also, Sandra Bullock does enough to make the character come alive right here in the present so that the dialogue is largely redundant anyway, and any backstory not necessary. I found I was emotionally invested in George Clooney's character as soon as any threat began because it felt so real, not just because of the visuals but because of the weight of the acting and the threat itself. Lastly, I'll say that I haven't been as emotionally exhausted by a film in a very long time, if ever. I certainly have never felt so emotionally up and down watching a film. I probably laughed, cried and felt anxious short of having a heart attack several times in several different orders in the space of just 10 minutes of the film. The threat feels real and while I'll admit that people might find the continued frustration the film makes you feel annoying, I do think that is the point, the film sets out to be frustrating, it is part of the constant emotional roller- coaster (cliché I know but it's also an appropriate way to physically describe the film) you feel like you're sitting on while watching it, and only adds to the realism of the threat. Importantly, Gravity doesn't feel like a typical sci-fi film. It could be set anywhere where there is sustained mortal threat, and I'm sure there are numerous films one could cite to show that in terms of narrative and theme it does nothing new. It does not pretend to be profound, or even particularly clever, but it does exactly what it sets out to do- show the plight of an individual though sustained trauma, alone and terrified- and I can't fault the result for what it is (though maybe I'm missing something). I tend to be overly critical of almost every film I see and I could count of two hands the number of films I have ever considered to be 10/10 films. I genuinely think this is one of them. From the opening shot I was in awe of the visuals, I have never seen anything that comes close to the spectacle of Gravity. From the moment the threat began I was scared, frustrated, happy, depressed, overjoyed, not necessarily in that order and several times over. I consider it almost mandatory that a film provokes some sort of emotional response, whether laughter, crying, happiness or even depression. One of the worst things a film can make you feel is cold. Gravity provoked emotional response and involvement in abundance, and it makes me love it even more. I will say that I'm sure that it would be different on a small screen in my own home in 2D, than in a cinema in 3D, and that would impact the entire experience of the film, though I'm sure that this is true of almost every film these days, but probably never as true as with Gravity. I left genuinely feeling a sense of having had all of my emotional limits tested one by one unrelentingly in such a small space of time on top of having witnessed the most stunning visuals I had ever seen as well as every aspect of the film (with the possible exception of the dialogue) having come together to form something that most closely resembles opera. I hate to use the word 'experience', it sounds too cheesy, but it best describes how I think of the way Gravity plays in a cinema in 3D. For that experience- 10/10",10,3,6,13 November 2013
Coraline," Mad, scary, wonderful- welcome to the world of Henry Selick
","I was enchanted just by what I saw in the trailer- it just looked...weird. And weird is what I love. When I finally watched the film I was taken away to a strange, wonderful land- I feat only Guillermo del Toro has managed before. It was just so...imaginative. Every individual thing was so...individual- straight from the imagination of a genius, and I loved every minute. At times, maybe it goes a little over the top, and perhaps it is a bit long, but I'm willing to venture it's better than anything Tim Burton has every done. The difference is that I don't think Burton every quite gets it just right, and this really hits the spot. It's scary, really quite scary at times, but that's fine, I think children should be allowed to be subjected to that, was there never a film that terrified you as a child? But not only that, it's just a fascinating, mystical place, and the whole thing is just wonderful. It's worth watching just because it looks amazing, but with the plot and the imagination of a genius in there too it makes Coraline one to watch with the whole family.",9,4,4,15 April 2010
12 Angry Men," A completely genius piece of work
","This was in fact my first ever black and white film, and I was very surprised with how much I enjoyed it. As a kid I had pre-conceptions the black and whites were dull, boring and terrible to watch. This is the film that showed me how wrong I was. This is an absolute masterpiece. I loved every second of it. For starters it is beautifully written, and I believed in every second of it from start to finish. I was completely absorbed, as if I was in the room with the characters themselves. Also, the entire plot is extremely clever, at the beginning I had my doubts as to whether the man would be able to convincingly persuade the others to vote not guilty, but I was totally convinced. I would love to watch this again and would recommend this to anyone looking to see some old black and whites.",9,0,0,24 August 2009
Batman Returns," Less realistic than its prequel, but still fun to watch
","A lot less realistic than the 1989 Batman but this still isn't a problem as Burton is unrivalled at creating fantastical worlds that you become absorbed into. The stories of The Penguin and Catwoman for example are less believable than The Joker's but DeVito's performance is almost as good as that of Nicholson's. The Catwoman story though seems a bit unnecessary and almost like it would be better if it were left out and more time were spent on making The Penguin's story more interesting. It gets a bit silly towards the end and you begin to see the start of the fall for the Batman franchise as the films never picked up until Nolan's Batman Begins. Having said that this film is not as bad as Schumacher's Batman Forever and no where near as terrible as the 1999 film Batman and Robin. Worth it just for DeVito and Walken's superb performances as the villains, though Pfeiffer is a bit weird in contrast.",6,0,1,3 September 2009
Finding Nemo," Magical and beautiful. One of Pixar's best works.
","It's not necessarily one of Pixar's most funny films, that title certainly goes to Toy Story 2. Yet I think that Finding Nemo has to be one of their most magical. One thing that Pixar does brilliantly apart from the script and the characters is to create new worlds. Toy Story creates a world in which toys come to life. A Bug's Life creates a world in which bugs run a society similar to that of our own, Finding Nemo creates a world in which sea-life interact similarly to humans- a remarkable feat that they pull off extremely well. It's an adventure story in which a dedicated father sets out to find his only relation. the character development is remarkable for a children's film- Pixar never underestimates their audience. The result is a beautifully created, wonderfully written piece, that maybe goes on a bit longer than it needs to, but it is funny in places and certainly will keep kids and adults interested.",8,0,2,27 April 2010
Constantine," I liked it, though I feel like I shouldn't have
","I guess I just enjoyed the sheer, nonsensical stupidity of the plot too much. It was just fun, and thrilling. Keanu Reeves isn't great in it, and it's hardly original, but I enjoyed it. I can't really put my finger on it. The plot line was complete nonsense, but maybe that's why. Maybe ever once in a while you have to forget the seriousness of life, not worry about it not making sense and just enjoy what's there. What is there is a perfectly fine film. It's scary without being over-the-top, thrilling and tongue-in-cheek when it needs to be. It's not a fantastic script, but if you stick with it I'm sure you'll have fun.",7,0,2,15 April 2010
Cloverfield," Interesting and thrilling. Really worth it
","I was really surprised by how much I actually liked this film. The 'mockumentary' style was really well done. As a result of course characterisation suffers and there is a lack of plot, but I don't care, because that's the point. You're not supposed to get bogged-down with all the whys and wherefores, because you're seeing it through the eyes of one of the characters and as a consequence there is no need for any of that. I really did enjoy it. There was a good atmoshpere surrounding it. I just felt uneasy all the way through like there was never anything quite right even when all seemed well and good. I've heard I lot of complaints about the ending, but I don't mind. If you think about it it's kind of obvious what was going to happen anyway- you're seeing through the camera held by one of the characters, so how did you get the camera? Really well made, I really enjoyed it. It's something different.",8,2,5,15 April 2010
Dear John," Not what I expected at all. Really don't bother
","I wasn't particularly looking forward to this film, yet I did like The Notebook, a film also along the same lines and by the same author. The reason The Notebook works is that it tells a story of love and human emotion over the course of a lifetime- something not really done by many films, but not just that, it's a heartwarming film. It's not necessarily realistic, and yet it's the story of true love above and beyond all else, something most couples like to relate to. The problem with Dear John was not the storyline. I thought the story was very appropriate, given the circumstances the armed forces find themselves in at the moment and I was intrigued by the situation. The problem was thus, apart from the war and a couple of other things throughout the film nothing much happens. The problem is lack of plot. The Notebook was a story about a man telling a story about lovers, which worked because it was interesting and there was always a sense of mystery. In the case of Dear John the story is virtually none existent. They fall in love, he leaves, and that's just the set-up, and it takes a while for that to get going, after which nothing much of any interest happens. It is nowhere near as emotional as The Notebook, mostly because the characters in Dear John just aren't as likable, I actually started to find one in particular very annoying. The acting isn't great in Dear John either, in complete contrast to The Notebook. I have already mentioned that The Notebook is the definitive story about a story above and beyond all else. In the case of Dear John, I just wasn't feeling that at all. It was actually very depressing at times. The Notebook deals with one very difficult subject, yet I think it does it very well, Dear John just made be think- why go to see thins film? You will get nothing out of it, and the ending, whilst realistic, is not satisfying at all for the genre. I did enjoy the subplot about the boy's autistic father, whose acting is the one good exception. If you want to see a story about autism though you watch Rain Man, not this. The only people I can see enjoying this is a very few girls between the ages of 12 and 15 maybe. Otherwise it is an extremely pointless experience.",4,1,2,12 May 2010
Crash," Heartbreaking, unpredictable and shockingly real
","I want to start by saying that this was never on my list of films I needed to see before I die, and yet in hindsight I feel that it should have been. It has a great deal to say about modern racism in a number of forms. The writing is excellent, I really do feel that its Oscars were well deserved. The film puts across a number of really interesting points which you begin to realise- with horror- that most, if not all of them are very much real. I loved Don Cheadle, as always, as well as Brendan Fraser, but I must say that the show is stolen by Matt Dillon, who's heartbreakingly tragic character is the portrait of the modern-day working class white urban American white man. At times I felt I knew where the film was going, but it twists completely around to shock yet again. And the mixture of sad and happy endings will satisfy and shock.",9,2,5,14 November 2010
Closer," Horrible, and yet I know it's a good film
","I did not know what to expect at all from this film. What I got was a well made piece of work that was nicely filmed and nicely written. The acting was good, especially from Jude Law and Natalie Portman. But in the end what is it about? What's the point? That's a question I still find myself asking. All it is is a film about the worst parts of relationships and the depressing bits of four people's lives put together. Even when things are looking up they soon hit a new low. It just depressed me- immensely. If I've missed the point then I'm sorry, but I can't help it. I don't see the point in watching a film about four horrible people lying and cheating their way around the each other- people they supposedly love. It's well made and there are good performances, but I wouldn't'y watch it again if you paid me- it's just not worth it.",4,3,5,15 April 2010
10 Things I Hate About You," Surprisingly good actually, didn't hate it as much as I thought I would
","I don't do romantic comedies, but this films is actually fairly well done. It's funny, the story-line is fun, if not a bit predictable, and Heath Ledger's performance is worth watching. I've watched it a couple of times now and enjoyed it just as much. The sort of thing you would enjoy more watching with your boyfriend/girlfriend, its not really that much fun watching alone. Probably more of a girl's film, a lot of girls I know consider this film to be very good, but for me it's enjoyable anyway. Though definitely a lot better than other romantic comedies I have been made to suffer. It's also surprisingly well written, I actually could really believe in the character, another surprising quality of this film.",6,0,0,24 August 2009
Armageddon," Love it, Love it, Love it
","Absolutely adore this, right from the very beginning. I know Michael Bay's got a hell of a reputation for making really long action films with hardly any story line and drawn out fight scenes (especially since Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen), but this is one film that he has done to perfection. This film has it all, a simple storyline (if not a little unbelievable but sometimes better than a complex one), brilliant special effects, a great cast in Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler and Billy Bob Thornton, all of whom are brilliant, and a great supporting cast including the likes of Owen Wilson. So its cheesy in places, but that's fine because the ending is truly emotional and frankly brilliant...",8,12,21,26 August 2009
Monsters vs. Aliens," Surprisingly good, still no Toy Story
","I must admit I was a bit sceptically about seeing this film, especially in the wake of such box-office disappointments as Igor. To be honest though, Monsters vs Aliens was never going to be an Igor, its completely different, especially with the addition of Reese Witherspoon, Hugh Laurie and Seth Rogan but to name a few. It didn't take me long to see that maybe my pre-judgements were indeed premature and that maybe this film is actually quite funny. Fine, the plot isn't the most interesting, or original for that matter, but it's a kids film and it does what it should do to keep the target audience happy. The film is actually extremely funny in place, not just because of the writing but because of the characters, in particular B.O.B., the President and 'The Missing Link'. Most of the characters are absolutely lovable and unlike anything I've ever seen in an animation before. The President is one of the funniest things in the film, the typical 'solve everything with violence' kind of leader, bumbling around thinking he's invincible. One of the funniest sequences in the film has to be the first scene that is set in the underground bunker involving the President and the General (voiced brilliantly by Kiefer Sutherland) done in the style of Dr. Strangelove, a hilarious scene which is well written and well acted (the voices that is). The only bad thing I picked up on was that for me Reese Witherspoon's voice did get annoying after a while, I do think she is a brilliant actress but for some reason I did find her a little over the top in this. On the other hand Hugh Laurie and Seth Rogan were hugely enjoyable and very funny. The plot was a little too easy to follow and even predict, but this wouldn't be a problem for most kids. Hugely enjoyable film, and very funny, which is a massive breath of fresh air as I don't think I've been this impressed by an animation since WALL-E, and by a Dreamworks animation since Shrek 2. Fine, its no Toy Story, but then again, nothing is.",7,0,0,19 April 2009
Collateral," Brutal and tense. A really decent thriller
","I really enjoyed this. It was great to see Tom Cruise in a different role than the usual action hero and I thought he did villainous contract killer rather well. The show was stolen by Jamie Foxx, as always he gave a brilliant performance. I found the premise to be really interesting and different- almost Hitchcockian (man gets into a taxi- he's an assassin). To add to that, the whole film was consistently so tense it really felt like Strangers on a Train or even Rear Window, especially the final showdown. It was a shame how the 'message' of the film felt a little shoehorned in, in the long monologues of Foxx and Cruise, but they were well delivered. The brutal and tense tone made it a real experience to watch and you really can never predict what is going to happen, or who is going to die, next.",8,0,0,29 October 2010
Enchanted," Sickly sweet. You'll love it or hate it
","I just want to say that this really isn't my sort of film. In my opinion Disney should be doing something more worthwhile with their time than making strange, sickly live-action films such as this. On the other hand, it is an original story done in such a way as to make it interesting. Amy Adams give a strong performance, and while the songs aren't Disney's best, they're still well performed. I did find it funny at times, and Timothy Spall has to be one of the best things in it. Conversely, I can't stand Patrick Dempsey. It's the sort of film that girls would love, and I can see why, though most other people would probably find that the minutes drag on.",6,0,1,20 April 2010
Die Hard 2," Like most sequels- it's a flop
","After the slightly disappointing Die Hard comes Die Hard 2, and like most sequels fails miserably. There is a number of reasons why a sequel can fail, for example loss of originality, something clearly not wrong with Die Hard 2 because it isn't difficult to keep a thriller plot line original. John McClaine's character is still the bad-ass police guy, so that's good. The reason why a lot of sequels fail is because they feel like they have to take everything to the next level- it has to be bigger and more bold than the last one, and in doing so they make the film even more stupid than before, in the case of Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen for example. However, this is not the case with Die Hard 2, things aren't really more over-the-top than its prequel, the problem is, if anything it's dumbed down. Things are less exciting, the plot is just plain boring, and the thing that made the first film so watchable- a well written villain played by a wonderful actor- wasn't there. The result? A boring story that feels far too long with boring action sequences that have nothing new in them and no memorable characters.",5,2,6,18 April 2010
Batman Begins," Sinister, frightening and scarily realistic
","I like this film for many reasons. It's more realistic than the previous Batman films (whether that's a good thing or not is a matter of debate), it's more sinister, something that only Burton previously touched on. It also seems more... inventive. Nolan takes a theme, for example fear, and weaves it into his plot so brilliantly and so subtly. You really feel as if the film has things to say about life . It's a lot more sinister that The Dark Knight, though probably not as dark, but it takes its time and doesn't spend epically long periods of time dwelling on complex story lines and themes and instead keeps it simple. Batman Begins says a lot more than The Dark Knight in a much simpler way, though it is probably less entertaining. There are fantastic performances by Bale, Cillian Murphy and Liam Neesan with some light relief provided by the good-as-ever Michael Caine.",8,0,0,3 September 2009
Ghost Rider," A comic book adaptation that in the middle of the craze flops phenomenally
","Practically everything about this film was a waste of time. The whole thing just felt so dingy- but not in a good way, in a way that made it boring. I kept thinking- come on! Get a move on! I normally quite like Nicolas Cage, but he really does disappoint in this. He is miscast, you just can't help but see Nicolas Cage and not the character. The plot is so stupid, and stupidly slow. To top it all off there are so many clichés and the bits that seem original are just silly, which all adds up to one pointless film capitalising on the success of other comic book adaptations. Watch Hellboy or Constantine instead. Boys of about 9-13 might enjoy it.",4,0,1,19 November 2010
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Boring, uneventful, stupid and just unlikable
","I didn't like the original Fantastic Four very much but I thought it did a good job of reinventing the superhero genre for a younger audience. This film is just bad. It starts off with the clichéd doomed marriage and progresses through a mire of bad acting, unlikable characters, a stupid plot and a terrible script to what has to be one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. The original was unbelievable, but in superhero films that's OK, but there should be a certain degree of reality, and here there is nothing. The characters were just unlikable to the point where I just didn't care about them, and don't even get me started on the acting. The only plus was the impressive special effects, but to be honest there is no other reason to watch this film.",4,0,3,23 April 2010
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," An interesting remake that actually does stand alone
","I should hate this, being such a fan of the original, but to be honest I really like it. The story has been realised in a lot more of an appropriate way for the modern world. Tim Burton has yet again done a tremendous job of bringing this fantasy world to life. It's eccentric, wonderfully mad, funny and just lovable. It does a better job of bringing the original material to the screen than the original, the only problem I have is with Johnny Depp. I don't have I problem with his acting, I think it's great, I just feel he's been directed to play the role too weirdly. The 'tragic madness' of his character doesn't sit too well with me, and I don't think all of the back-story was necessary. Aside from that it is a great film that does stand up to the original.",7,6,9,13 April 2010
Black Hawk Down," Disappointing and badly written, but it's not all bad
","I'm not a fan of Ridley Scott, I find he so often gets carried away with 'projects' and makes them unnecessarily long and often they become boring. Black Hawk Down is no exception. It is too long. The character development is virtually non-existent, which considering the length of the film is inexcusable. Also, it means that I actually don't really care about the characters because I have no emotional connection with them whatsoever. So when it comes down to it the only way to identify the characters is to classify them as either American or Somali, which for me kind of defeats the humanist point that Scott was obviously trying to get across. On the other hand there are some good actors to look out for, Eric Bana, Josh Harnett, Ewan McGregor, Jason Isaacs and Orlando Bloom all make welcome appearances. The film does also make some interesting points about war, interesting given modern events and that it was made pre-9/11. In the end the film is good to watch for its nice visual effects and extremely gripping fight scenes. The film did grab me emotionally, but not because of the events that the characters found themselves in, more because of the situation that the Somali civilians found themselves in, something that the film didn't cover (which is fine because that's not what it's about). I think what I'm trying to say is that I didn't particularly connect with the characters, in what was an overly long film with drawn-out fight scenes that are well done, but frankly boring.",6,0,4,30 January 2010
Blood Diamond," Well made with good performances. A film that makes you think while entertaining
","This was a film that I connected with, as with Hotel Rwanda and unlike Black Hawk Down. DiCaprio pulls off his finest performance ever and Djimon Hounsou is excellent. The film succeeds in being entertaining whilst showing the horrors of the Sierre Leone civil war, a subject which I knew nothing about. This was something I think Black Hawk Down failed at, it did de-glamorise violence but at the same time failed to engage me with the characters. Blood Diamond certainly does engage the viewer with the characters, and you do feel a genuine emotional attachment with DiCaprio and Hounsou's characters in particular at the end of the film. I fell for the film and by the end of it felt completely engrossed in the lives of the extraordinary people portrayed in it. There were also some really nasty but relevant issues brought up, war crimes, child soldiers, the reminiscence of the bitterness of white supremacy in Africa (from both points of view) and of course the main one- the trading of conflict diamonds.",8,0,1,30 January 2010
Alice in Wonderland," Very disappointing, visually impressive, but all adds up to nothing
","I had had high hopes for this film, with a cast including such stars as Johnny Depp, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter; such treasures as Matt Lucas, Stephen Fry, Michael Sheen and Alan Rickman (not to mention a cameo by Christopher Lee); and directed by Tim Burton; this really looked like one to watch. When I saw the trailer, however I was a little apprehensive. It looked too... dark? Strange? Weird? I couldn't quite put my finger on it.My fears were confirmed when watching the film. The performances were excellent, all of the performances. Depp and Bonham Carter were especially good, and Lucas provided brilliant comic relief. The characters were also really well written, I could really feel their emotion and knew their past without even fully being told. The Mad-Hatter was really well written, the tragic insane man who sometimes is even aware of his own insanity; the angry and highly frustrated Red Queen who felt unloved... I could go on. The problem lies in the story, it just doesn't go anywhere and I know it's taken from Lewis Carrol's books, but the film just felt badly put together, it was just a collection of bits, put back to back and in the end went no-where. The start was promising and the ending was good, but in the middle there was nothing. Also, it just felt wrong. Burton is known for his visionary genius, and rightly so. Batman, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and others not only have great stories, but look and feel brilliant. Alice just didn't look right, it was far too dark and not at all what I imagined, I still can't quite put my finger on it but it just didn't feel right. I much preferred the Disney original.",6,1,3,30 March 2010
Avatar," Some very impressive visuals make this worth watching despite flaws
","Normally if a film has an underwhelming plot it takes a lot to make up for it. Visuals, for me, contribute little when weighing up pros and cons. In the case of Avatar thought it is safe to say that the visuals are something special. I knew that they were good after hearing other reviews, but they really blew me away, they have to be some of the best I have ever seen. Marks also have to be given for the sheer imaginative genius involved. The story isn't particularly brilliant or original for that matter, but the amount of effort that has obviously been put into the creation and the design of world kind of makes up for it. The story obviously draws on influences from fiction and real life. There is some Pocahontas in their as well as some Star Wars, and it obviously has something to say about conflict, especially in the wake of recent military campaigns in the Middle East. I did enjoy the film, even if the plot sometimes did move at a snails pace despite the action sequences running at full speed. I sometimes felt as though nothing had happened to further the plot for a good while, but I was still generally interested in what was going on, it could have done with being maybe half and hour shorter.",8,2,5,4 June 2010
Die Hard," Good fun, but not as good as I expected
","It took me a long time to finally see Die Hard. I enjoyed the sheer nonsensical plot line and Bruce Willis' no-nonsense approach to the villains. The one-man-against-the-rest intrigues me as well. It is stupid, but it's stupid fun. Alan Rickman does steal the show as the head villain, but Bruce Willis is still very watchable. When it came to the end though, I just wasn't fully satisfied. I just felt that it didn't live up to expectations. Maybe it was because my expectations had been amplified by years of hearing such good things about it, maybe I just over-anticipated it. I still enjoyed it, even if it wasn't all I was hoping. It's violent, sweary, edge-of-the-seat stuff. Perfect for a Saturday night in front of the TV.",7,0,5,17 April 2010
Die Hard with a Vengeance," The one time the Die Hard films got it really right
","This is my favourite Die Hard film. It has a more interesting plot than any of the others. It doesn't have completely over-the-top action sequences that seem out of place even in a tongue-in-cheek film. Jeremy Irons plays a wonderful villain that rivals even the performance by Alan Rickman in the first film. It's a truly thrilling, quite creepy at times, edge-of-the-seat film. The best thing in the whole thing though is the relationship between the characters of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson, who are both brilliant together. I enjoyed the sub-plot between them and the racial tension that was there simply because of Jackson's character's paranoia.",8,0,1,18 April 2010
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Surprisingly really funny. Well worth a watch
","As a rule I don't like Will Ferrell, it fact I don't find him funny at all, so I was really surprised by how funny I actually liked this film. Maybe the context of this film, the 70s setting allowing the sexist jokes to be satirical rather than tasteless, made it for me. Maybe Ferrell is just funnier in this. In fact I kind of forgot it was actually Ferrell as I found his performance truly brilliant- and hilarious. Having said that I think Steve Carell, who I normally hate even more, stole the show. His character and the way he played it was really funny. Maybe it just fitted in with the ludicrousness of the film's setting. The whole set-up was an interesting one, which led to some interesting dialogue about sexism, not too serious, but enough to be noticed. Finally, after Ben Stiller, Vince Vaughn, Tim Robbins, Jack Black, and others popped up for cameos I was gone. I really enjoyed it.",7,3,4,29 October 2010
American Gangster," Well made with some very good performances- one of Ridley Scott's best
","I don't really have much experience in watching gangster films, but I do with watching Ridley Scott's. As I made clear in my review of Body of Lies I'm not his biggest fan. I didn't like Kingdom of Heaven, and I didn't think that Gladiator or Black Hawk Down were as great as their reputation. American Gangster was completely different. The story was so simple, unlike so many gangster film- a crime lord running a drug empire. And that's partly why I liked it. I thought that Denzel Washington was fantastic, definitely the best I've ever seen him in. I also prefer Russell Crowe in this role as a pose to the character he plays in Gladiator, though I thought he made a better performance in Body of Lies. It was very well made, though it seemed to waste a lot of time setting up the story. The other problem was that Washington was so good that when he wasn't on screen it was really noticed. There was also no real climax, I would have loved to see Washington's character developed even further and I was a little disappointed when he was arrested. What I would have liked to have seen was more on Lucas' empire, more of the fear at which he ruled his employees, though I guess it was restricted by the real-life events. The story did waste time on Roberts' (Crowe's character) life and it was too long as a consequence of this, again I missed Washington. It is well worth seeing though, it is very brutal and realistic, and at times quite scary, yet all the time fascinating. I still preferred Body of Lies though.",7,0,1,23 February 2010
Bruce Almighty," A really well written piece that conveys some important messages, and very funny
","I like some of Tom Shadyac's previous work, I loved The Nutty Professor and Liar Liar, and Ace Ventura: Pet Detective was enjoyable. Of course Even Almighty, which followed this film was no-where near as good as any of these. Jim Carrey is one of my favourite actors, but Bruce Almighty sees him in one of his finest roles. I always maintained that he is a fine actor, verging on the genius (especially in comic-value). Morgan Freeman was also brilliant to watch in this, he was the wise Lord of all, with a sense of humour. Together with these terrific performances is a really well written script which not only has some really prominent things to say about religion and faith, but also about relationships and about ourselves. At the end of the day the film is very humbling, especially as we see Carrey's character develop. Jennifer Aniston normally annoys me, but I feel she gives a good performance in this, Steve Carell can also be annoying, but it fits his character here. And the thing that amazes me most is that it gets the balance perfectly- it still manages to get all its points across whilst still being very, very funny.",9,0,0,23 February 2010
Casino Royale," Not what I expected- in a good way
","After the travesty that was Die Another Day I kind of gave up on a new Bond film being any good. The franchise underwent a complete makeover, instigating a new actor to play Bond and consequently a whole new style to the films. I still wasn't interested though and it took me a while to see Casino Royale. When I finally did catch up with it however I was very pleasantly surprised. The result of the makeover was something new, modern and exciting for the Bourne-generation, and yet still recognisable as a James Bond film. I was impressed with Daniel Craig's young, reckless take on the character and the plot, while taken heavily from the book, was still fairly original. Seeing the opening sequence in black and white was nice, as it explained the origins of 007, and the title sequence was nicely worked with an underrated title song. The stunts were just as impressive as the classic films, and still exciting. The film was fast-paced and yet it slowed down as the right times. My only quibble is with Vesper's death, it was too foreseeable. I'd have preferred something closer to the book, something that shocked audience and character alike. Otherwise, I really enjoyed it.",8,0,3,4 April 2010
Beowulf," Looks and feels brilliant, a real experience... shame i didn't like it
","I wasn't too sure what to make of this film when I saw it. I think maybe it's one of those that you have to watch twice before you fully understand it. It is true that is looks amazing. That is to say the animation is really something. It's done quite obviously in CGI but in such a way that it really suits the dark mood of the film and the story. It is almost worth watching just for this reason. The characters actually look like the actors portraying them, bringing a new purpose to the job of voice-over. It's unfortunate then that I didn't like it that much. Obviously Beowulf is a classic story and making a film such as this was inevitable. The problem is that doing it in animated form kind of dumbs it down a little. What I mean is I'm not really sure who this film is for, the dark story and horror elements (Beowulf is essentially a horror story) make it for adults but the animation says its for young teenagers. If it wasn't animated the amount of blood featured in this film would no doubt make it a 15 certificate. The result is a film that doesn't really know what it wants to be, some films can get away with appealing for both audiences but Beowulf doesn't quite seem to pull it off. The voices of Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins and (dare I say it) the addition of Angelina Jolie are fun to listen to and suit their characters perfectly. The overall result is something that is fun to watch but becomes boring for both audiences about halfway through.",6,0,0,28 October 2009
Live Free or Die Hard," Entertaining sequel successfully transformed for the modern day
","At first glance you kind of say 'A new Die Hard, 12 years after the last, why?'. When I watched this film I felt that way, but quickly I began to enjoy it. There was an interesting plot- more interesting even than the first two Die Hard films. The characters were interesting. The villain was well written and played well- the problem with Die Hard 2. The action sequences were played out to a modern audience but underneath there was still this old-school cop who wasn't fully tuned into this modern world. Unfortunanely it did descend into some action scenes that were stupid even for a Die Hard film and seemed to build to a climax and then not really go anywhere. Still fairly enjoyable though.",6,1,3,18 April 2010
300," Wow
","I never would have seem this film had a friend not asked me to go with him and I must admit I enjoyed it. If you're not a fan of huge epic battle-scenes and hardly any story-line (like me) you may not like this, the whole film is practically one big battle scene after another, and the plot is virtually not existent. However, I was never bored, if nothing else the film is stunning to look at and you find yourself staring at the screen open-mouthed because you can't quite believe the special effects can look so perfect. It really is one of those you see for a laugh on a Saturday night with your mates. There were a few random nudity scenes, which seemed to be there just because they could be, not necessary.",6,5,7,24 August 2009
Fantastic Four," Not terrible, but not the worst film ever. Enjoyable at times
","The problem with the superhero genre is that it has seemed have developed into a genre for the early teenager. Films such as The Dark Knight, Spider-man to some extent, Ghost Rider, Hellboy and Iron Man do not look to 7-11 year olds as their primary audience. That is certainly one thing that Fantastic Four does well. It doesn't take itself totally seriously and it has a laugh. The characters are stupid and annoying at times and the whole thing is way over the top, but this is great for a younger audience than what the superhero genre normally targets itself towards. I didn't particularly enjoy it but I can see why people did. It does well for its target audience.",5,1,3,23 April 2010
Click," Funny, serious, emotional- surprised? So was I
","I went into this expecting a typical Adam Sandler comedy- silly, violent, but at the same time relaxing. I found that Click was none of these things. Firstly it isn't really violent, at least not as much as Sandler's other films, Happy Gilmore, Anger Management. Secondly, it isn't silly. It's funny when it needs to be, but it knows when to stop. Lastly, it isn't relaxing. Whether that's a good thing or not, this film is a Sandler film that's actually about something. It has a story to it, an emotional story. It's even quite scary in one or two places. Either way, I really enjoyed Click. Sandler shows he can act in a semi-serious role, switching between funny and serious depending on what's needed for that particular scene. There is also a really good performance by Christopher Walken who, as always, steals the show. I laughed and cried my way through this film, which demonstrates perfectly that comedy doesn't have to be stupid or violent. All's it takes is a good story.",8,1,2,15 April 2010
The Proposal," Surprisingly good, fun and actually really funny in places
","Not as bad as I'd thought it would be. I don't do romantic comedies at all, but actually The Proposal isn't all that bad. Yes it's predictable, unbelievable and quite sickening at times but actually it's quite funny too. Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds have great chemistry together and share some really funny scenes. So it's not the most intelligent or impressive of films but it does what it sets out to and is laugh-out-loud funny in places. Maybe it could do with being just a touch shorter, but there are some quite funny characters to keep you laughing right up until the end (which is very predictable, but who cares?) Very enjoyable.",7,0,3,27 July 2009
Dodgeball," Same old stupid comedy. But it works, and somehow it's actually really interesting
","I didn't really have much hope for this film. I saw an ordinary, stupid Vince Vaughn comedy featuring Ben Stiller. How wrong I was. It's not the best written of scripts, but oh well, it's funny. Ben Stiller is especially funny in the role of the 'villain'. I really enjoyed the story as well, I was really interested in the dodgeball, and by the end I was really rooting for the underdogs. The characters were surprisingly well developed. So it's a bit stupid at times, but who cares? It's enjoyable, I enjoyed it. It had me laughing for hours. I don't like Vince Vaughn, but he was watchable in this. If you're looking for a light-hearted comedy for just relaxing and not having to think about, this is the perfect choice.",7,1,2,19 April 2010
Atonement," Fantastic, lost for words
","Just brilliant, started off a bit weirdly, but got better an better as it went on. It was so beautifully written. It did get a little confusing with all the time-jumps but all becomes clear towards the end before the final really emotional scene. I don't think I've ever cried so much at a film in my life. James McAvoy and Kiera Knightley are totally believable and are so good together in this film it actually seems real. But the plot is so deep it's only sort of half-way through when you begin to realise that the film is not in fact about them but about her sister. By the time the end came along I was staring open-mouthed at the screen just not believing that this is how they would end it, it was the perfect ending for what the film's about. And the scene at the Normandy beach is superb too. Liked it so much more than No Country for Old Men, this should have won the Ocsar.",9,1,3,26 August 2009
