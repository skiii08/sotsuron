The Mask," Smokin!
","Jim Carrey, Jim Carrey. Isn't he just the coolest actor? Well I think so anyway, he did such a great job in The Mask the enthusiasm the face impersonations I thought he did such a great job and I give all the other actors credit for their great job too but it was Jim Carrey that was the most enjoyable in this film. I give it 8/10 and I also Recommend The Pest , Dumb and Dumber and The Matrix",Null,0,0,11 February 2000

The Waterboy," Great.I really thought this movie was cool

The Matrix," The Coolest and Most fun filled movie you can ever watch.
","This is the third comment I have put on here but I have just seen 'The Matrix' for the 12th time (yes I know 12th!) and I think it is the most clever, action packed, fun filled and not to mention creative movie I have ever seen.The first time I saw it I completly fell in love with it (And Keanu Reeves!) The Wachowski Brothers really did do their homework and the concept of the film is brilliant. It isn't one of those American Junky movies where boy meets girl , boy falls in love with girl, It is one where you don't get mushy rubbish (okay so there is one two minute part) you get an action packed fun ride that keeps you and you're pals amused. My only regret is that I didn't see the movie sooner! I saw it January this year. And please people i'm sick of you saying 'Keanu Reeves can't act to save his life' because you are just jealous because he's got the looks and the talent something which you dumb people don't have.Anyway, this might sound silly but 'The Matrix' gets me all phsyced up before I go for a run. It really does. Watch the Ju Titsu parts where he fights Morpheus and it really helps. The visual effects are truly amazing, and the sound and it really deserved those four Oscars, but I still think it deserved more Oscars than that. Well anyway any other Keanu Fans email me! See ya, from Monique.P.S : WATCH THIS MOVIE PEOPLE IT ROCKS. P.P.S: I LOVE YOU NEO!",Null,0,0,19 April 2000
The Matrix," I had just had to write another comment about this brilliant movie!
","I have just finished watching this movie for the tenth time and I still love it.I just had to write another comment about it because this is one fab movie. First where did they get the ideas for this movie from? Absoloute intellegence. The cast was wonderful, all played the parts fantastically.Man I wish I could've played the part of Trinity! I especially loved Keanu Reeves ( I wish he was younger! Isn't It hard to believe he will be 36 this year!) Great music. Extremly intellegent story line. You could never remember all the lines to this movie and it continues to amuse you.People you have to watch this movie.It is the absoloute best.I can't wait for The Matrix 2. From MONIQUEP.S: Email me if you know of any other terrific movies Keanu is in that I would enjoy!  KEANU REEVES FOREVER PEOPLE! HE IS ONE BEAUTIFUL, LOVELY GUY!",Null,0,0,12 February 2000
The Matrix," Brilliant.
","I love this movie.The special effects were amazing,it kept me fascinated and the cast did a magnificent job.I hate how I have read other peoples comments and they have said how badly Keanu Reeves acted.How could the say that?Keanu Reeves was a fantastic actor in the Matrix and always will be.Isn't it hard to believe that he is 35.He looks about 25 and I wish he was younger.He is extremely beautiful.Anyway i'm getting off the subject.This movie is a definite 10/10.I have seen it 6 times now and i'm aiming for 100! It is fantastic.Terrific action scenes and fighting and it is spot on.I love it.",Null,0,0,4 February 2000
