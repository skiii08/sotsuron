Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Or, Democracy & Porno in America by Alexis de Toiletville
","Darwin's Rule of Moviewatching #57: Anything in which an ugly hooker is the most sympathetic character should not be watched while eating. For proof, see Woody Allen's 'Deconstructing Harry,' South Park's 'Chickenpox,' and 'Borat.' The long, broken-English title accurately describes the premise: inept, degenerate Kazakh state TV journalist Borat (Cohen, from the character he created) and his long-suffering producer Azamat (Davitian) go to New York to conduct interviews with real Americans, to get a snapshot of American culture as well as some sex, if possible. Borat first introduces us to his village, including his hateful neighbor, his massive wife, the town rapist ('only humans!') and the mechanic/abortionist. The highlight of his New York visit is his interview of veteran feminists ('Give me smile, baby!'). After seeing 'Baywatch,' he dragoons Azamat into a quest to California to find & marry CJ (Anderson). There's absolutely nothing new to 'Borat,' since the premise follows that of Hunter Thompson's 'Fear & Loathing' & Christopher Guest's 'Spinal Tap,' as well as French historian Alexis de Tocqueville's first-person survey of America in the 1830s. The 'Kazakh' language is patterned after Charlie Chaplin's 'Tomanian' lingo in 'The Great Dictator' and the gags are lifted from comics from the Marx Brothers to Benny Hill to the creators of 'South Park,' these last noted in the credits. Cohen & director Charles nevertheless picked proved winners & their pacing is good, never letting the film get dull. Like Guest's characters, Borat skewers American traditions, presumptions & prejudices by blindsiding people with his, shall we say, very different characteristics. These include: kissing men in greeting, strict & subjective sexism, virulent anti-Semitism, a complete lack of toilet training & admiring the US for being a mighty military dictatorship. To say that 'Borat' is scatological is like saying 'Hoosiers' has basketball in it. Some scenes, including Borat proudly bringing his feces & a fat hooker to a genteel Southern dinner party & his protracted, nude chase & punch-up with Azamat in a hotel are probably hard to take for most people, although Cohen's sheer comic talent & timing make them really, really funny. Borat's driving lesson & his shopping for a 'pussy magnet' to drive across the US are a hilarious satire of modern America's most cherished & most delusional cultural institution: the style, freedom & machismo of automobiles. It would be hard to top Leslie Nielsen's rendition of the National Anthem in 'The Naked Gun,' but Cohen scores, singing the 'Kazakh' national anthem to the tune of the 'Star Spangled Banner' at a Texas rodeo while dressed in red, white & blue ('Kazakhstan is the greatest nation in the world/All other countries are run by little girls'). 'Borat' is actually rather highbrow, requiring a knowledge of American history & tradition, as well as some idea of how the rest of the world views the US, to be fully appreciated. Unfortunately, the thought required also exposes inconsistencies in Borat's background. If Borat is so utterly clueless about America, how did he learn to speak English? Since American-pattern TV shows have long been available worldwide, why would Borat assume that CJ is a real person? And if he's a neo-Stalinist stuffed shirt professional, why does Borat live in a dumpy but colorful village instead of a bland Communist high-rise? Borat's Kazakhstan evokes no sympathy or understanding, a missing-link dump populated by toothless, incestuous primates content to wallow in their own feces. Indeed, the film's biggest flaw is that Borat & Azamat are too filthy & perverted--and Borat too moronic--to evoke sympathy, even allowing for 'cultural' differences. Nor does Cohen really try to humanize Borat until the second half. The closest he comes is when Borat, after hitting rock bottom, accepts 'Mr. Jesus' at an evangelist service--yet another comic triumph brilliantly balanced on the edge of a knife. Luenell, as the hooker, provides the only really human touch as she has a 'good time' with Borat at a honky-tonk (their scenes on the mechanical bull turn a sappy scene into a laugh riot). Anderson, appearing as herself & listed in the credits as such, never comes across as anything but a micro-shallow, self-serving sex object & inadvertent porn star, so let's not hear anything from her--ever--about how there's more to her. In the end, 'Borat' winds up laughing at America and the fictional Kazakhstan, not with them, since everyone ultimately comes across as either irredeemably degenerate or inexcusably hypocritical. Still, it has to be seen in its entirety to appreciate the many funny parts--and those are very much worth it.",6,2,6,5 November 2006
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The First BBB Movie
","As in 'Big Budget B' Movie, the sort of visually spectacular, splendidly orchestrated live-action cartoon that Lucas & Spielberg pioneered separately and, on this occasion, together. In 1936 heartthrob college professor & graverobbing mercenary Indiana Jones (Ford, perhaps by way of Harold Robbins & Steve McQueen) is hired by the US Army to find & loot the original Hebrew Ark of the Covenant from its presumed hiding place in a lost Egyptian city before Hitler's SS/Gestapo/Afrika Korps/Kriegsmarine/Luftwaffe/Abwehr can get it. To do this he must first procure a critical icon from a girlfriend (Allen) that he dumped and who is now running Kathmandu's answer to Rick's Cafe Americain (there's no piano, but the wind whistles most soulfully). A two-minute reverse 'Casablanca' interlude ends with another plot twist and plenty of enjoyable, stunning mayhem. Characters come & go in no particular order, including nebbish professor Brody (Elliott), Egyptian laborer Sallah (Rhys-Davies, who could give any Tonto or Dr. Watson a run for his money), tramp sea captain Katanga (Harris), rival mercenary Belloq (Freeman, who eventually comes across as French) and cartoonishly evil Nazis (Lacey, Kahler & Higgins, all perfectly cast). Ford holds the film together with a quintessentially American mix of determination, frustration, weariness & wonder. Allen brings a coarse feminism to the role of damsel tied to a set of railroad tracks. The film fails because its convoluted plot can never find even the tiniest ground in common sense, much less reality, with plot holes large enough for whole solar systems to nest comfortably. The largest of many large, of course, is that the hero's job is to rob other peoples of their cultural treasures and sell them for money. In a scene that desperately needed to be cut, Belloq actually points this out to Jones. Other giant leaps include Hitler's obsession with the occult (nonexistent), Germany's dominance in Egypt and the Mediterranean (never happened) and enough Biblical heresies to make Harry Potter look like the Pope. The charm of 'Lost Horizons' (Jones flies over the same mountains at about the same time, but Shangri-La prefers Ronald Colman) and even 'King Solomon's Mines' is replaced here by breathtaking action punctuated by Groucho-esq one-liners ('I'm making this up as I go along') and the obligatory juvenile, Spielberg gross-out scenes (Tarantino slices off body parts, Spielberg likes snakes, bugs & sharks). Still, Lucas & Spielberg are the masters of effective excess and 'Raiders' is best enjoyed as a series of cartoon or 'Lone Ranger' or 'Perils of Pauline' adventures (the opening sequence is supposedly inspired by a Disney Ducks cartoon, anyway). Williams's music is as wonderful as any he's done and perhaps the best ever in an action film. The success of the franchise assured, here are some ideas for sequels: 'Raiders of the Declaration of Independence,' 'Indiana Jones & George Washington's False Teeth,' and 'The Hunt for Lenin's Embalmed Remains.'",5,9,22,11 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Pompous, Ponderous Cuteness
","The last 'Star Wars' sequel avoids some, but not all, of the pitfalls that the series had so deftly steered around before. Luke (Hamill) must rescue his friend Solo (Ford) & foil the Empire's latest diabolical plot while facing down the demons in his own heritage. 'Return' undermines one of the great strengths of the series--the excellence of its villains-- by introducing not one but TWO new ubervillains. One is the Emperor himself (McDiarmid), an arthritic, dermatoligically challenged fugitive from 'Kung Fu,' while the other, wholly unrelated badguy is the giant, sexually depraved worm (yes, really a worm) Jabba the Hut. After slowly building a tough damsel-in-distress under her enveloping costumes in the first two films, Carrie Fisher is reduced to a harem-girl plaything for the huge, slimy puppet Jabba, which has to be some kind of record-setting low for an actress. Hamill, though talented, doesn't have the presence to be an epic hero while Ford is mostly reduced to comic relief. Much of the film is taken up by events on the planet Endor, a Disney Adventureland inhabited by teddy bears. Except for the rousing theme carried over from the earlier films, John Williams's music is heavy & ponderous to the point of parody. Still, 'Star Wars' is about spectacular, heroic action & 'Return' delivers, with the opening battle on Tattooine & the climactic space fleet action making up for the mushy molasses of Endor. Billy Dee Williams helps take up any heroic slack left by Hamill & Ford. As with the rest of the series, 'Return' isn't science fiction but outer-space fantasy adventure, so forgive any pretense of technological or social commentary. 'Return' is aimed at devotees of the 'Star Wars' but is still an enjoyable thrill ride for anyone.",6,2,5,29 April 2006
Pitch Black," Nice Shine Job
","There were outer-space ghoul stories before 'Alien' ('Space: 1999' had a few) and since ('Event Horizon'). Most of them are pretty bad and 'Pitch Black,' which is utterly unoriginal, could easily have been, too. Instead it's a cool, character-driven yet action-packed, dark thriller. An interplanetary space transport crashes on a desert planet with 3 suns and apparently perpetual daylight. Like 'Alien,' the film begins by exploring the handful of survivors. Like 'Lifeboat,' it gradually divulges that some of them have things to hide. Not Riddick (Diesel), an escaped murderer being returned to prison by bounty hunter Johns (Hauser, effectively icy & sleazy). When perpetual day suddenly turns to perpetual night, the creepy-crawlies come out to kill, rend & chow down on Fresh Human. To survive, the others must accept Riddick, who is tougher than all of them and has had a prison 'shine job' on his eyes that lets him see in the dark. But Riddick must also overcome the hatred he has for all of his own kind, a rage that he covers under a cool, wry facade of independence. Will Riddick eventually sacrifice the others to ensure his own survival, or maybe even just for one universal up-yours to the human race? Diesel has a star-making role, making a repugnant character sympathetic, giving us fleeting glimpses of Riddick's sadness & loneliness while never, ever detracting from his granite-souled strength. Several other actors have more work to do in this film than most action flicks, but they are all up to the task. The guilt-ridden pilot Fry (Mitchell), a dark, refreshing break from the butt-kicking babe stereotype begun with 'Charlie's Angels,' holds the others together while Riddick comes & goes. Mitchell has a steeliness & style that belies her blonde cuteness and holds up well opposite both the brawny, in-your-face Diesel & the taut, cool Hauser. David, as a Muslim space pilgrim, brings religious faith ('Because you do not believe in God, does not mean God does not believe in you') to counter the others' anger, despair or wry selfishness ('Look to thine own ass first'). The dark, percussion-heavy score is perfect for 'Pitch Black's' visual effects, which are somewhat less spectacular than recent 'Star Wars' but more effective, a background rather than a replacement for the action. 'Pitch Black' is as entertaining as any old Saturday matinÃ©e, much better suited to our know-it-all times, without the condescension & stereotyping to which Hollywood is usually so devoted.",8,3,4,11 April 2006
Cross of Iron," Fine Film Built Around 'a Piece of Worthless Metal'
","I saw this film in 1993 at 29 Palms in the Marines. It was selected as a training film for the entire company by my platoon leader who wanted to depict the leadership qualities of the noncommissioned officer & the cohesion of small units. It got a tepid reception from Marines, then enamored of sci-fi actioners & the sardonic 'Full Metal Jacket,' who thought the scenes of male bonding were sappy, or 'gay.' Nor did the company commander seem to appreciate Peckinpah's anti-establishment tone. Anti-establishment is really the best description of 'Cross of Iron' rather than anti-war and, though it is his only real war film, holds to the dark theme of government/corporation vs. manly individualist that marked most major Peckinpah films. The story follows ace platoon NCO Steiner (Coburn) as he holds together his elite but war-weary men & deals with his officers: wise Colonel Brandt (Mason), dissolute adjutant Kiesel (Warner), heroic Lt. Meier (Galo) and weaselly Lt. Triebig (Fritz). Hardest to deal with is his company commander, the ambitious, arrogant Captain Stransky (Schell) who transferred from the comfort of France to the horrors of the East to, as Kiesel notes, achieve 'spiritual domination' of the war, symbolized by his obsession with winning the Iron Cross. Significantly, most of the experienced soldiers, including all the other officers, have already won the Iron Cross while Meier & Steiner, Stransky's subordinates, are highly decorated. Though not well known in English, Heinrich's book is a World War II counterpart to 'All Quiet on the Western Front' as it starkly depicts a German soldier's struggle to remain human through the horrors of Total War & the prospect of Total Defeat. Heinrich is a bit awkward & preachy compared to Remarque & this comes through in the film, notably in scenes with the officers. For a film with a modest budget, it's pretty long, accentuating the preachiness. The impressive multinational cast suffers from the necessity of putting English-speaking stars in the main roles. Only Coburn & Warner make even slight attempts at German accents. Coburn depicts, rather than details, Steiner, using his wicked smile & humor sparingly while bringing to life a talented, tortured individual torn between his hatred of war, love for his friends & his fear of leaving the only world he knows. Mason is, as usual, both nuanced & commanding. Schell is fine as the pompous captain but only gets a chance to show his tremendous talent when Stransky is manipulative, notably the scene in which he blackmails Triebig. The fine Senta Berger gets little chance to develop nurse Eva. The soldiers are all scruffy to the point of ugliness, a Peckinpah feature discarded in the body-by-Soloflex action films made from the 1980s onward. Peckinpah had refined his trademark touches to a fine point. There's the brotherly love the men share without being 'gay' as well as their conflicted attitude toward women, at once desiring, worshiping & fearing them. The contrast of hardened, jaded veterans with innocent youth, first explored in 'The Wild Bunch,' permeates 'Cross of Iron' in Steiner's interaction with the Russian boy (Prohic) & Private Dietz (Nowka), the latter playing a 'kid's game' of avoiding sunlight as the platoon is about to make an attack. Like 'The Wild Bunch,' the film has a bizarre but engrossing opening montage, featuring war & Nazi footage mixed with band music & a German child's rhyme. Above all is the theme of resistance to oppressive authority. Steiner rejects the bullying of Stransky but also the condescending sympathy of Brandt & Kiesel, which he hates just as much, and expresses disdain for all 'medal scavengers.' Two new Peckinpah features: a surrealist motif including flashbacks & fantasies, and an overt political tone driven home by photos of Vietnam & a Brecht quote in the closing montage. The action scenes, especially the slow-motion effects, are as good as any by Peckinpah. Considering the low budget, they should be the stuff of legend, featuring extraordinary photography & precise, correct detail. Peckinpah's operatic violence contrasts with the crushing, unmanning action depicted in versions of 'All Quiet in the Western Front.' To balance making a film about the most demonized military machine in history, Peckinpah is at pains to depict ALL the major German characters, even Stransky, as anti-Nazi. Stransky declares himself a Prussian aristocrat, Steiner is openly disdainful of a SS soldier & Brandt lays plans for the existence of Germany after the Nazis. The platoon soldiers wear a mishmash of uniform, civilian clothes & pilfered Soviet items, further de-Nazifying them. This is probably Peckinpah's gloomiest film except 'Alfredo Garcia'--which is pretty gloomy--but it lacks the exquisitely artful darkness of 'Apocalypse Now.' Then again, Heinrich's book isn't 'Heart of Darkness.' If you can watch 'All Quiet,' 'Cross' & 'Apocalypse' all in one day without abandoning all hope, then you're as cheerful as Pippi Longstocking. 'Cross of Iron' is a unique work, either as a war film, an action movie or even a Peckinpah work.",8,14,16,12 August 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Ill Chills, Li'l Thrills, at Facile Bill's Kill Mill
","It's a measure of how far you've come in the world when you can drive around in a flaming yellow truck with 'PUSSY WAGON' in big letters and still have all Hollywood's A-list babes begging to be in your films. It's not a good sign of how far either the entertainment industry or society has come, but let it go. Fine-tuned professional assassin The Bride (Thurman) leaves her coven of knife-wielding Girl Scouts for the white picket fence but is murdered during her wedding by her erstwhile sisterhood, on the orders of their master, silkily manipulative neo-ninja Bill (Carradine, who can't be blamed because he sold out a long time ago). Trouble is, they didn't kill her dead enough. After a long, sexually abused coma (we're only just getting started, pilgrims) she recovers and embarks on a Revenge Quest, hunting down Charlie's Fallen Angels one by one, each encounter leading her closer to putting Chilly Bill on the backyard grill. Does she have more in mind for Bill than just an evening with sharp-edged kitchen appliances? Revenge is a dish best served liquefied, however, and if The Bride triumphs over her old girlfriends (I used to hang out with these trollops? she seems to be thinking), it won't happen without spilling more blood than the Exxon Valdez had crude. This film is too contrived even to be condemned as misogynistic, with the girls's unreal slicing/dicing cutesy machismo contrasting so crazily with their meek subservience to the sedentary Bill (Tarantino might have called him Dick, but that gag's been done) that, if you buy into it, you may be so confused as to need a remedial class in Gender Stereotyping. If so, try 'An Affair to Remember' followed by 'Tarzan & His Mate.' That this film has nothing original is an understatement akin to saying that Enron was dishonest. No longer content to just ape the budget filmmakers of the past, Tarantino now embarks on a frenetic jamfest of the old cheapies. This includes, but is not limited to: TV, chopsockey, ninja-samurai, Spaghetti Western, anime, film noir, exploitation, sexploitation, blaxploitation and cereal commercials ('Silly Rabbit!'). I'll never eat Trix nor watch Speed Racer again without the dry heaves. I also won't easily take Thurman, Liu, Basinger or Fox seriously again (can you say 'Typecast?' Good!), despite their demonstrated talent & considerable past accomplishments. No schoolgirls lick the spilled blood off each other, so Tarantino is evidently still too uptight for lesbian vampire flicks, 'From Dusk Till Dawn' notwithstanding. And he hasn't taken a swipe at Sesame Street yet. An artist must have standards, right? (I just hope a deadly Asian swordmaiden named Cookie Munster and her lovable but dumb boyfriend Biggy Byrde aren't in our cinematic future). He still hasn't redone it all ('Truck Turner' featured sex slavery & a lynched cat) but what he's redone is impressive, if tasteless. Unfortunately, the old cheapies were only made to give a few fast thrills in exchange for a couple of fast bucks. What charm they had, such as Isaac Hayes's glowering presence, Lee Van Cleef's steely smugness, Michelle Yeoh's sexy ferocity & Bruce Lee's matchless, butt-kicking art, was incidental--someone would have done those scripts, if they hadn't. You could take them or leave them, but 'Kill Bill' rubs into our faces a sense that we are being honored with an interpretation of a high art form. It just isn't there. Wanna watch 'Kill Bill?' Get a party mix of Cap'n Crunch, Count Chocula and Lucky Charms and do shooters of Jolt Cola in Quik Strawberry mix. I Dare ya! I DOUBLE Dare ya! By the way, there's a 'Kill Bill Vol. 2,' but let it go.",1,12,20,12 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," An Honorably Darn'd Worthwhile Dragon
","Pop culture religious heresy is a pleasure only mildly guilty as long as it's done with reverence. Spielberg nailed this formula long ago with the 'Raiders' movies & Ron Howard takes a pretty good whack at it with 'The Da Vinci Code,' or, 'Dan Brown's Big Book of Renaissance Puzzles.' Harvard religious symbology professor Langdon (Hanks) is brought in to consult on the murder in the Louvre of his associate Sauniere (Marielle), which features numerous cryptic symbols & clues left by the dying man in his last minutes. Police cryptologist Sophie Neveu (Tautou), after learning that detective Captain Fache (Reno) is convinced that Langdon is the killer but knowing that the professor is not, helps Langdon escape. They can only clear their names by solving riddles deliberately left by the dead Sauniere & leading to the exposure of a secret society dedicated to preserving the hidden truth of the 'Holy Grail,' a revelation that would embarrass & perhaps destroy the Catholic Church hierarchy. The Quest for the Grail crosses the paths of Opus Dei official Bishop Aringarosa (Molina), his vicious, self-mortifying albino henchman Silas (Bettany), oily Swiss banker Vernet (Prochnow), wealthy, eccentric Grail expert Sir Leigh Teabing (McKellen) & an unseen, sinister mastermind whom Silas & Aringarosa know only as 'The Teacher.' Brown's convoluted tale is built around puzzles & selective interpretations of historical fact & legend, a challenge for a filmmaker since the viewer, unlike the reader, can't turn back the pages or put the story down until the movie comes out on video. Howard & Company get off to a strong start. Akiva Goldsman's script begins deftly, following the book closely without losing or intimidating the viewer. Howard's direction sets the tone darkly & tensely, not ponderously or somberly. Hanks is understated & terse as Langdon, much as Howard directed him in 'Apollo 13,' where he also played a stressed-out professional whose life depends on his skill. Tautou is strongly, heartbreakingly evocative of Audrey Hepburn, almost as if she were in 'Charade' and her roles with Cary Grant were reversed. Bettany, Reno & Molina portray their heavies with even more sympathy than Brown let them have, one way in which the movie improved on the book. Howard & Goldsman do an excellent job of covering up the book's greatest flaw, which is the ludicrous ease of solving a key mystery, by keeping the action moving steadily & reducing the mystery's prominence. The film is still aloft when it gets to Teabing, whom McKellen makes his very own with a perfect mixture of self-important eccentricity, condescending intelligence and scholarly eagerness. As the clues unravel, so does the film. It goes on at least a half hour too long, passing one Oh-My-God climax after another, desperately throwing in more Western Civ puzzles like fuel on a fire. CGI special effects in the second half confuse more than illustrate, though they probably cost more than all those ever created by Ray Harryhausen. Perhaps Howard, like most other big-ticket directors, is no longer capable of telling a story without whiz-bang effects, or maybe he couldn't find another way to deal with Brown's concentration of so many difficult, confusing clues near the end of the story. For most of the movie, the action keeps the viewer's attention away from glaring holes in Brown's religious-historical background, particularly the flawed interpretation of Da Vinci's 'The Last Supper' which should be apparent if you can answer 'yes' when Indiana Jones asks if you ever went to Sunday School. Unfortunately, all that baggage comes crashing down as the film approaches its end. Langdon's attempt to explain it away in a short speech to Sophie falls flat, tending, if anything, to negate the whole point of the bloody adventure they share. Despite several brief attempts, Hanks & Tautou never get to fully develop their characters either individually or together, another drawback of following Brown's story closely. Those looking forward to a chemistry like Cary Grant/Audrey Hepburn or Gregory Peck/Sophia Loren will be quite disappointed. Despite the global furor, the Opus Dei order is not demonized, since the story clearly indicates that Aringarosa & Silas are operating beyond official sanction. Catholic characters in fact come across with a sympathy--sometimes even nobility--when the story has time for them, which is seldom. If the 'The Da Vinci Code' is open to a religious criticism, it's a depiction of Christianity as a religion only fully appreciated by brainiac puzzle-masters. To that end, this reviewer has left you an anagram in the title of this review, made up of the names of two real-life people associated with this movie plus the name of one vital plot device. Like 'The Da Vinci Code,' it's best enjoyed without thinking much about any historical rationales behind it.",6,2,6,19 May 2006
The Godfather: Part III," Overlong, overblown, overwrought, over-hyped
","While the first two films were allegories of the development of modern organized crime in New York, Las Vegas and Sicily, 'Godfather III' moves into the realm of spy thrillers while at the same time being a sort of reunion, comeback effort for the old Godfather band. The once cool and assured Michael Corleone, now humanized by age and the torment of his guilty memories, contrasts with over-the-top violence that would have fitted into a 'Die Hard' movie. Perhaps Pacino should have played two roles, like Peter Sellers--one as Michael, the other reprising Tony Montana from 'Scarface.' Still, if anyone makes this film work it is the always-fine Pacino, as well as the overlooked Joe Mantegna. Diane Keaton, who so effectively gave us an 'average American' perspective of the Mafia in the first two films, has little to do in this film except accompany us on a tour of Sicily--which we already had in the second film. A striking, effective surprise ending didn't quite pick me up because I had pretty much lost interest a half hour earlier.",5,4,8,5 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Excellent Excess
","The very first note of John Williams's horn-blaring score as the film's title in thousand-foot-high block letters flashes on screen is the very moment when American film-making turned inexorably to big-budget, grand-themed audiovisual extravaganza strung together with simple stories, snappy catchphrases & cutesy jokes. But if George Lucas decided to follow Henry Ford rather than John Ford, he built a Shelby Cobra & left Pinto-making to his many, many imitators. Ironically, he himself remade one of the finest works of film master Akira Kurosawa, the Western-themed 'Hidden Fortress,' with one scene (the fight in the bar) lifted from 'Yojimbo.' As a result, 'Star Wars' has a bit of the jittery discomfort of characters trying to fit into a story that wasn't quite made for them, like people with past life experiences that intrude into the present. Kurosawa's hero is split not into two but THREE heroes in 'Star Wars' (four if you include the princess, who has a more prominent role in 'Star Wars'). Hamill's Luke is often overshadowed by Kenobi (Guinness, whose skill had aged better than any fine wine) and Solo (Ford, in the role that deservedly made him a star), though he often holds his own as the clueless but determined farmboy-turned-hero. In less than five minutes, 'Star Wars' sets the standard of outer-space audiovisual special effects that the industry was bound to follow from then on, forever sweeping away the earnest, toylike realism that Gerry Anderson was then giving us in 'Space: 1999' in favor of exhausting but beautiful orgies of fast, violent, sweeping movement culminating in explosions of bright color & blaring sound. No wonder there's never any sex. 'Star Wars' is science fiction only because it's set in outer space, by which standard 'Dirty Harry' is a detective story & 'Last Tango in Paris' a romance. Little attempt is made to explain the technological wonders depicted (we never find out why light sabers never have to be recharged or get even a cursory explanation of the Death Star). What little science there is can't be counted on, as when Solo extols the drag-racing abilities of the Millennium Falcon in parsecs, which are units of distance, not elapsed time. But Lucas never means to educate, only to entertain. Solo is a smuggler, not a science officer, while the others are not doctors or engineers but warriors, royalty or villains. Lucas's hammerhanded excess works because it never lets up & never goes for the cheap & easy. Though the heroes are unconvincing, 'Star Wars' creates an array of badguys in the Galactic Empire that remain unsurpassed in cinema, headed by Darth Vader, who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. In another irony, the most memorable scene in 'Star Wars' is the motionless roundtable conference chaired by Tarkin (Cushing, in the greatest role of his long career) which yielded phrases long & gleefully repeated by a delighted America ('This station is now the ultimate power in the universe!' 'This bickering is pointless!' 'I find your lack of faith disturbing'). Perhaps, with the space program petering out & the hard realities of nuclear energy coming home to us, our fascination with scientific exploration was wearing thin. In the 1960s it enabled the cast of 'Star Trek' to bring the writings of sci-fi geniuses to life with cardboard & aluminum foil. Never again. What better honor, or infamy if you like, could there be to 'Star Wars' than that the 'Star Trek' movies of the 1980s followed the simple themes, cuteness & spectacular effects of 'Star Wars,' turning their backs on their own heritage of awed exploration? Perhaps that first detractors and then supporters of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative nicknamed it 'Star Wars' so convincingly that the original name was quickly forgotten. The film might be a bit dated with its holistic, New Age mysticism (feel the force FLOWING through you!) which likely owes more to Jack Kerouac than Musashi Miyamoto & which became more difficult to depict with a straight face the farther the sequels & prequels went. Nevertheless, it was a worthy successor to the Code of the West, especially in contrasting Darth Vader with Luke & Kenobi. 'Star Wars' can't really be judged by the standards of other films, partly because it reset the standards & partly because it became, most unusually, the fourth in a series of six! But there's no doubt that it's a heroic sensory extravaganza that will leave the viewer at once exhausted & exhilarated--and will do it over & over again, without offending, condescending or making one think too hard. If you just want to escape to a galaxy far, far away, jettison all skepticism, lower your shields & prepare to make the jump to hyperspace.",8,14,22,22 April 2006
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The Most Spectacular Outer Space Fantasy Ever Made
","Although 'Star Wars' set a new, spectacularly high standard for movie effects & action, it was also a remake that featured a cast of unknowns & semi-retired character actors. Even with a big budget and built-in audience, it would have been easy to make a second-rate follow-up or even a dud bad enough to kill the franchise. Leigh Brackett's clever script, Irvin Kerschner's directorial craft, George Lucas's unprecedented production values & the energy & intensity of the cast allowed 'The Empire Strikes Back' to set a standard for outer-space adventure that has never been equaled. Lucas's first original 'Star Wars' story emphasizes the series's two great strengths: fantastic action & the wily, wicked Galactic Empire. After their hidden base is found & destroyed, the Rebel Alliance flees in disarray, with Solo (Ford), Princess Leia (Fisher), Chewbacca & the droids hotly pursued in the damaged Millennium Falcon by an Imperial fleet. Luke (Hamill) vanishes into a jungle planet to find Jedi mentor Yoda & complete his training. Story flaws, including the fact that Luke's training takes place in the same amount of time as the Millennium Falcon's pursuit & the introduction of important characters near the end of the film, are unnoticeable unless you're looking for them. The action starts early & never lets up, with the battle of the ice planet alone more than enough for any action film. But there's plenty more where that came from, with the amazing flight through the asteroid field & the lightsaber duel in the cloud city standing out. Ford makes the most of his opportunity of developing Solo as a charming 'scoundrel,' with Fisher game as his reluctant love interest. Hamill, who isn't really leading-man material, is sufficiently believable as the peasant hero growing into an elite warrior. The New Age, Oriental 'Force' (rarely called a 'religion') gets more prominence in 'Empire' but never bogs down into hokiness or boredom. All these elements combine to give the film a never-failing theme of harried heroes hounded by an evil force that is so vast, powerful & diabolically clever that the viewer is moved almost, but not quite, to despair--exactly where Kerschner wants us. This is outer-space fantasy, not science fiction, so don't look for any science. And despite 'The Force' as a plot device, there's no point in looking too deeply for Heavy Themes or Subtle Meanings. In fact, subtlety of any kind was pretty much killed off by this and other Lucas & Spielberg films. All you get with 'Empire' is a couple of hours of straightforward, nonstop, matchless thrills without condescension or manipulation that you can enjoy again & again without ever getting tired of it.",10,1,2,29 April 2006
