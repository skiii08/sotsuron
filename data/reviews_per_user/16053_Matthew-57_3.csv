The Blair Witch Project," An Amazing Film.....
","The title that i gave this comment field is an extreme under-statement towards this film.'The Blair Witch Project' is honestly the best movie of this decade...for-sure my favorite film ever.The film had every thing in a movie that you would want....a closeness with characters in an unimaginable way.  I felt as if i knew these three film students.  Their lives touched me in an incredible way, almost unreal.Ahhh...the way that it was shot in 8mm was a great touch, lines like 'turn that fu**ing camera off!' is close to everybody, isn't it?  Other movies had tried to attempt this technique of filming, yet Daniel Myrick and Eduardo SÃ¡nchez turned it [this technique] into an art.If i may, i give this movie my two big toes up, way up!",9,1,2,13 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A movie with a lack of understanding
","I, as star wars fan loved this movie.  It had everything that I had hoped for, and a little extra - It had great special effects, a OK story line, and that's what I was looking for.  George Lucas does extremely well at doing these things.  He just wants to tell a story and add something more to it [the sgi].  The original Star Wars movies did this extremely well, and so did Episode One.  The original movies were, as i hate to admit it, B-Movies, and so was this one.  My Question here is, why does Episode four, five, and six get all the great reviews and Episode one, get bad reviews, when essentially they are the same type of film.",9,7,9,4 August 1999
2001: A Space Odyssey," Philosophically Sound.
","Kubrick, I love you for bringing this masterpiece to life.Never again is the history of this planet will such a masterfully done film will be created.  This film, I admit, does make me fall asleep! For me, that does not matter, as this film will never be outdated.I amazes me 2001 was made in 1968. It still lives up to what we, as a scientific race, could create if we have continued towards space, at the momentum that man was going at when this film was made.  Kubrick was right to predict what he did, if we did over-fund the space project, as we did in the sixties, we could be living in a artificial gravity controlled space station that orbits the earth.  Why didn't we?The fact that HAL (i.b.m) did create a 'personality' of his own is not that far-fetched.  Programmers have been working on AI for years.Kubricks, and Author C. Clarke's vision of time and space (ref. A Brief History of the Universe, by Stephen Hawking) in the final scenes of this film were so far ahead of it's time, that even today we wonder of these possibilities that felt so strange to us as we watched, and pondered.",Null,1,2,14 August 1999
