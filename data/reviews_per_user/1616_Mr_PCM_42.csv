Men in Black 3," Better than 2, but that's enough
","After the delightful originality of the first Men in Black film, there was really only one way for the film series to go with the sequel - down. But no one expected the second instalment to be as woefully short of the first film as it was, leaving the franchise's reputation in tatters. This meant that MIB III had a major job to do to get the film series back into the black, critically speaking (pun intended). While the third instalment does repair some of the damage done by part 2, the lack of the dynamic between Smith and Jones for the majority of the film seems to leave a whole in the plot.Men In Black III's latest plot line takes a new (but probably inevitable) direction by using time travel to send Will Smith's wisecracking Agent J back in time to the time of the moon landing and to work with the earlier incarnation of Agent K, played with excellent Tommy Lee Jones impersonation by Josh Brolin. The usual hijinks that we have come to expect from the Men in Black ensue, including some terrific sight gags and pop culture references to famous people revealed as aliens. Meanwhile, while the Tommy Lee Jones-shaped hole in the majority of the film is felt, the refreshing new take on the partnership dynamic added by Brolin does inject some impetus into what would have been an otherwise ailing franchise. However, the replacement of Rip Torn's Z with Emma Thompson as new chief O seems one alteration too many, lacking the spark that made Z's character such a favourite. Mercifully though, Frank the Pug is notable by his absence.Generally, MIB III is much better than its predecessor, but still lacks the charm, wit, warmth and originality of the first film - although learning more about how K got to be such a crotchety old man does provide some interesting developments, and as always, the creatures are very effectively realised by excellent special effects and make up teams. However, Will Smith's Fresh Prince shtick is now starting to wear a bit thin after so many years since the TV show ended - his more grown up efforts in films such as 'I Am Legend' showed there was more to him than that, which he should pursue. He's outgrown this stuff - a fact proved by the lack of a Will Smith track on the film.Overall a relatively good film to enjoy, but let the franchise rest now - enough's enough.",7,0,1,24 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as bad as first thought, but oh dear - why Jar Jar?
","In light of the completion of the Star Wars saga with Revenge of the Sith, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace is probably due for a re-evaluation. While by no means anywhere near as good as the original trilogy, neither is it really that bad a film. After all, it's still Star Wars! The one overwhelming criticism of Episode I is the presence of one Jar Jar Binks. A computer generated amphibian with possibly the most irritating and child-like character and almost unintelligible voice in the history of cinema, with the possible exception of Chris Tucker's Ruby Rhod in 'The Fifth Element'. Jar Jar is merely a walking talking marketing device aimed squarely at children. It is he who is the main cause of irritation for the die-hard fans. But also the lack of action, and the slightly over-long podrace also drew complaints, which reeked of a set-up or plug for a computer game (which of course appeared at the time of the film's release). Further, the plot was rather heavy on talking and politic scenes, causing the plot to slightly drag, and Lucas's over-reliance on computer generated scenery at times prove slightly nauseating for the viewer.However there is much to recommend the film and to appease the critics (although they remain mostly over-looked in order to criticise the film more effectively). Whilst it does feel like a commercial, the pod race is still an adrenaline-fuelled and exciting race scene. The lightsaber battle scenes are outstanding, in particular the final scene where Darth Maul fights both Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan with a double-ended lightsaber. Indeed, some have called this lightsaber duel the best of all six films. The choral music which accompanies this battle, Duel of the Fates, is possibly the most iconic piece of film music since Indiana Jones or even the original Star Wars films themselves. And baddie Darth Maul himself is also probably the coolest-looking movie villain since Darth Vader.Also, as a beginning to the prequels for the Star Wars original trilogy, there are a few lovely teases of what is to come to tie the series together  including one for the fanatics with an appearance of a young Greedo. The plot adequately covers Anakin's origin story, but there are possibly not quite enough seeds sown for Anakin's future fall from grace, and in Episode II the transformation thus seems far too steep. However, re-watching the film after seeing the following two prequels does shed more light on character motivations and the like. In particular, in light of Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine's machinations and manipulations in Episode I have become even more obvious and intriguing. There is also a brief but pointed first meeting of Palpatine and Anakin at the film's conclusion.Leaving aside the irritant Jar Jar Binks, the acting is largely very good. Liam Neeson is serene and regal as Jedi Master Qui Gon Jinn, and Natalie Portman does a terrific job in the dual role of Queen Amidala and the handmaiden Padmé (though the former is shared to some extent with Keira Knightley). Ewan McGregor, while competent as a young Obi-Wan Kenobi, does not really make the role his own, and seems unsure of his identity within the role. Instead he tries to mimic a young Alec Guinness, but this unfortunately makes his performance rather weak. Ray Park, while having little to do acting-wise, is superb in the fight scenes, and is instrumental in making the film's climactic lightsaber duel one of the best of the entire franchise.Overall the film is nowhere near as bad as many fans claim it to be. However it is still probably by far the weakest of the six films, and as an introduction to Star Wars for new fans they would be far better served by watching the original 1977 classic. But the fault lies primarily in the character Jar Jar Binks. While the overlong pod race feels like a commercial for the video game it is still visually impressive throughout, and the lightsaber battle is certainly worthy of the first Star Wars film in over 15 years. And with George Lucas directing, the magical feel of Star Wars is certainly present in the fights and space battles, and the story is a good and involving one, if maybe slightly over-elaborate, but this is perhaps needed in order to begin to tie all the films together. Fans will also enjoy spotting potential links to the original trilogy and cameos from future characters, including Greedo and Jabba the Hutt (and the Mos Eisley Cantina Band on the DVD deleted scenes). Unfortunately, as stated before, the film drastically suffers from the suffocating presence of the hideous aforementioned Gungan monopolising far too much screen time. Had Jar Jar been killed off early, the film may have gained a 9, but instead the film barely scrapes an 8  which is not good enough for Star Wars.",8,9,12,7 February 2006
Minority Report," The future is not necessarily bright
","Spielberg has returned to his favourite type of film  the summer blockbuster. Minority Report is a good old-fashioned crime/conspiracy thriller, but with a difference  the crimes are predicted and prevented before they even occur thanks to the ability to see the future. When the Chief of the Pre-Crime Department John Anderton (Tom Cruise) sees a prediction of himself committing murder, he finds himself on the run trying to prove his innocence and figure out who he kills and why, before he actually does it, and who has set him up.The film is a fascinating vision of the future, and therefore comes with hundreds of futuristic-looking gadgets that sure would be fun to have around now. But this is not a bright vision of the future; colours are kept to a minimum, and the film has a grimy, grainy look to it  which shows the future to not be the perfection we would hope it will be. It makes a refreshing change from the normal science-fiction which shows the future to be all smooth and shiny, with lots of green to make it look pretty. Instead it looks drab, impersonal and unfriendly.This is Cruise's first major foray into science-fiction, but Spielberg is an old hand at this kind of thing now, thanks to ET, Close Encounters and Jurassic Park, and his experience and expertise are clear. The story is adapted from a story written by legendary sci-fi writer Philip K Dick  and surely there is no one better than Spielberg for adapting a sci-fi tale and turning it into a crowd-pleasing blockbuster.Colin Farrell appears, in the middle of an extremely busy film-making period for him, and again shows his versatility in playing a rather slimy young hotshot who investigates Cruise's department. Max von Sydow also stars, in possibly his biggest and best role since 1973's classic horror The Exorcist.The story is genuinely exciting and gripping, as a good conspiracy thriller should be, and keeps you guessing right through. Some viewers (myself included) may however find some scenes disturbing  most notably a couple of scenes involving eyeballs. Eyeballs aside however, Spielberg has delivered the perfect Saturday evening film, and begins a profitable partnership with Cruise that continues into the slightly less gripping War of the Worlds. It is however probably best if you just sit back and enjoy, and try not to think about the film's potential plot-holes too much, as you will spot them. Just relish trying to figure out the answer before the film gets there. A perfect evening viewing really.",8,1,2,8 December 2005
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," An Apatow-shaped hole in the writing credits - and it shows!
","Another entry into the canon of work from Judd Apatow, but the 40-year-old Virgin or Knocked Up this is not.The presence of Russell Brand merely on the poster would be enough to put most people off seeing this film were it not for the additional presence of the name of Apatow underneath, but it seems that even his magic has gotten waylaid here. The film's premise has mild potential as it sees Jason Segel's Peter Bretter getting dumped by his TV star girlfriend and jetting off to Hawaii to get over her, only to find she is staying at the same hotel with her new boyfriend (Brand). However, what follows is a by-the-numbers plot line that is straight out of the standard Hollywood Rom-com scriptbook. There is little of the originality that made The 40-year-old Virgin such a break-out hit.Jason Segel is barely a poor man's Steve Carrell or even Seth Rogen, with little of the hangdog likability that either of those had in abundance – to the extent where you wonder what Kristin Bell's Sarah Marshall of the title (herself little more than an identikit blonde) ever saw in him in the first place. Russell Brand is his usual obnoxious self whilst Mila Kunis plays the standard model new girl in Peter's life, but she at least manages to breathe some charm into an otherwise two-dimensional role. Apatow merely produced this film, and the lack of his name in the writing credits has clearly harmed this comedy.The humour is less painfully funny and more just painful for large parts, while any time that Brand is on the screen is outright nauseating. The story plods along going in no direction in particular, seeming content to just meander and enjoy the beautiful scenery of Hawaii, which the entire film feels like an extended advert for the holiday island. There are one or two mildly amusing scenes, generally involving Kunis, but do not expect this to live up to Knocked Up or Superbad; its pales in comparison. Perhaps Apatow has become a victim of his own success, as expectations are very high now, and this certainly did not live up to them. Had expectations not been so high, then possibly the beautiful backdrop of Hawaii and Kunis's charm might have made this film somewhat watchable.",5,2,6,11 April 2009
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Quite simply, terrific fun!
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl When the first Pirates of the Caribbean film came out in 2003, expectations were low. Recent swashbuckling fare in the cinemas had been disappointing to say the least (Cutthroat Island anyone?) and this new Disney adventure was based on a theme park ride! Early production news was generally greeted with trepidation, rather than anticipation - which made Pirates of the Caribbean such a wonderful surprise. 2 hours of rollicking adventure that harks back to the glory days of Errol Flynn and the like, and more recently films such as Raiders of the Lost Ark. Such was the impact of Pirates of the Caribbean that it not only spawned a trilogy (with a fourth in the works) but completely refreshed and re-launched the family adventure, leading to enjoyable imitations such as National Treasure – and even providing the impetus for Spielberg to finally get round to making the fourth Indiana Jones movie. Even Johnny Depp can be grateful for this juggernaut of a franchise; his outstanding show-stealing performance reinvigorated his career and thrust him into the mainstream of Hollywood, as well as landing him a thoroughly deserved Oscar nomination.The plot (such as it is), opens with a suitably creepy nautical fog scene – which proves somewhat deliberately disingenuous for what is to come. After a misleading tone is set, a plot develops which revolves around a band of bloodthirsty pirates searching for some treasure or other in order to free themselves from a curse, with our swashbuckling heroes in valiant pursuit, trying to save the captured damsel in distress. So far, so predictable. But what makes Pirates work is that it knows how corny it is, and rather than trying to disguise it, director Verbinski and producer Bruckheimer (who has his explosive and exaggerated fingerprints all over this yarn), turn the corny all the way up to 11. What follows is a true piece of enjoyable escapist cinema. It may not be highbrow, but it sure is entertaining, and Johnny Depp is truly a revelation as Captain Jack Sparrow. For all his previously eccentric parts in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and the like, this is the role which will forever define him – and Depp is fine with that! The treasure is little more than a macguffin, and it is the characters – particularly Depp's Sparrow – not the plot, which provide the basis of what is a very entertaining film.Yet while Depp does steal the show, it is not solely his film. Orlando Bloom does (barely) manage to expand his emotional range from that seen in Lord of the Rings, and Keira Knightley manages to display for the first time the contradictory qualities of feisty modern heroine and elegant damsel in distress that gave her success in Pride and Prejudice and The Duchess. Geoffrey Rush however, is the equal to Depp in scene-stealing stakes, and provides a fascinating villain to the piece.All the ingredients for a fully enjoyable epic adventure are here. Exotic locations? Check. Stellar (largely British) supporting cast? Check. Swordfights and chase scenes? Check. A scene-stealing heroic lead who dishes out one-liners galore? Check. Finally, an enjoyably hokum plot with some macguffin or other at its centre? Double check. All of these elements combine wonderfully to make Pirates of the Caribbean greater than the sum of its not-inconsiderable parts.",9,0,2,8 January 2011
12 Angry Men," So simple yet unbelievably effective
","12 Angry Men could serve as a textbook for how films can be brilliant without any special effects or action sequences. All you need is a good idea, and 12 Angry Men certainly has that.The film's premise could not be simpler; 12 jurors discuss a case and attempt to determine a verdict. It's as simple as that. In the wrong hands this idea could be a disaster, or at least deathly dull. However, Sidney Lumet has created a riveting character study investigating motivation and prejudices in ordinary men.The twelve are all from a great variety of backgrounds with widely differing attitudes. However, the case seems clear cut and they are all convinced the defendant is guilty. Except one. As the facts of the case are bandied back and forth, Henry Fonda, as the sole juror returning a not guilty verdict, must convince his eleven fellow jurors to think about the case more.It is hard to lavish enough praise on 12 Angry Men. It is also the first film I have reviewed where I simply cannot think of any criticisms whatsoever. The film is enthralling and extremely clever; it is impossible not to get caught up in the back and forth as the sole juror attempts to sway the opinions of the other eleven, gradually calling into question what seemed like a clear verdict. It is a fascinating insight into the unseen workings of the legal system, and how ordinary men really play a role in the system. Further, the characters are never given names, there are virtually no supporting actors for the twelve, and the entire film takes place within one room, enabling all attention to be focused on the details of the case rather than identifying with the characters. It is this that makes the film so simple yet unbelievably effective.Henry Fonda is one of the finest actors of his generation, but no one is overshadowed or shamed by his terrific performance, and everyone holds their own. All twelve actors give outstanding performances.12 Angry Men is a masterful film that should be compulsory viewing for any filmmaker. There was never a clearer display of what can be done without complicated plot lines, special effects, overblown action sequences or overbearing music. A great idea with a tight script and sound acting performances are all you need to make a timeless classic. Faultless.",10,2,3,2 March 2006
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Simply magical
","The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is an enchanting tale of magical creatures and places, a battle of good and evil, and of four children coming to terms with both being in a strange new land and their great importance to it. Originally a children's book, there is much for both younger and older viewers to enjoy.Like many English fans, I grew up with the old BBC television series, which was corny, hammy and wooden in the extreme, yet ultimately endearing and magical. Sunday nights were never the same after it finished. So it was with a slight sense of trepidation that I went to see this sacrilegious new version of one of my favourite books as a child. As it turns out, I needn't have worried, for director Andrew Adamson has blown the Beeb's version out of the water – as was expected by most. While most obviously the film benefits from a mega-budget the BBC could only dream of, the acting of the young leads is also superior. Here, Lucy (Georgia Henley) is even more wide-eyed and innocent, Edmund (Skandar Keynes) even more of a snotty little so-and-so, and Susan (Anna Popplewell) more mother hen-ish and reasoned. But there seems to be also a rather unlikeable quality to Popplewell's Susan; she seems much whinier than many fans will remember from the books – and it is supposed to be Edmund who is the unlikeable one. The best acting of the four however comes from the eldest; William Moseley's Peter here is less assuming or decisive. While he still takes great care of his siblings, the oldest Pevensie is portrayed by Moseley as being a more reluctant hero, taking more seriously his duty to his brother and sisters than that of saviour and King of Narnia – adding previously unseen depth to the character. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast as the voice of Aslan; his regal, dulcet tones perfectly fitting for the magnificent lion. But the show stealer is Tilda Swinton as the White Witch. Many have complained about her hair being blonde rather than black, but that is all that there can possibly be to complain about her performance. Her icy stare and cold demeanour, coupled with a restrained performance (in a role such as this it would be very easy to attempt to echo Barbara Kellerman's over-the-top performance in the TV series) perfectly capture the seductive and later chilling essence of Jadis. Ray Winstone, Dawn French and Rupert Everett provide a (greatly required) slightly lighter side to the film as the voices of Mr and Mrs Beaver, and Fox (a new character). Winstone especially is terrifically funny as the geezer beaver with the cockney accent.The narrative itself is simple and easy to follow, as befits a film which is primarily a children's story. But still, Adamson handles the action extremely competently, especially considering this is his first live-action film (he is primarily known for directing the Shrek films). Obviously there is a heavy allegorical slant to that of the life of Jesus Christ which some may find distasteful, but if you can get past that then there is a terrific story to enjoy, and visuals for your jaw to truly drop at. One of the most important sequences in the book is when Lucy steps into the wardrobe and emerges into Narnia for the first time. The sheer wonder felt by the young girl at seeing this entire snow-covered world in the back of a piece of furniture in an English country house is shared with the audience. The creatures too are excellent, centaurs and fauns blending seamlessly their human and CGI body parts.There is a smattering of new material in the film that appeared in neither the book or the TV series that may have die-hard fans spitting feathers, but the added scenes, including a stand-off on a slowly-melting frozen river and a prologue in wartime London, serve to add necessary depth to the characters. The final battle scene is also considerably extended from the two pages it had in C. S. Lewis's book to a battle to nearly rival that of Pelennor Fields (the first of many Rings comparisons).The score is beautiful; Harry Gregson-Williams has created a musical setting to nearly rival anything produced by Mr Shore. However the lack of anything choral or a stand-out phrasing to serve as a signature for the film means that the soundtrack alone will probably be better suited to background music rather than your full attention. A piece with the drama and power of 'The Bridge of Khazad-Dumb, for example, would have topped off the soundtrack very nicely.But this is only a minor criticism; Andrew Adamson has created a magical interpretation of the ultimate fantasyland, an accurate translation from page to screen, an exciting and captivating story and enchanting characters. As the original story was rather short, he does not need to get bogged down in detail and can therefore proceed through the film at a brisk pace, picking up speed to reach full throttle in time for the final battle. Although the film is over 2 hours, the time will simply not be noticed.A useful side-note for cinema-goers – watch through the acting credits for an extra sequence with Lucy and the Professor (an under-used Jim Broadbent – not often you can say that about him!) which may provide teasing hints for the future of the franchise.Roll on Prince Caspian!",8,4,5,2 January 2006
Ted," Funny despite itself, and oddly enjoyable
","Ted is rude, crude, full of crass humour and 'clever' references, self-aware to the point where the characters do all but wink at the camera, and absolutely ludicrous. Yet it is this acceptance of what it is, and complete lack of loftier ambitions, both genuinely funny and actually endearing in a bizarre kind of way. The premise is so simple it's genius: A boy wishes his teddy bear would come to life, and by a miracle that is exactly what happens, and the boy and the bear promise to be friends for ever. But rather than a childhood friendship story, Ted flashes forward to what happens when the boy grows up, and the bear ages along with him. What we see is the now grown-up Johnny (Mark Wahlberg) living with his long term girlfriend Lori (Mila Kunis) and the eponymous bear (voiced by Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane), who is now a foul-mouthed, weed-smoking and generally hard-living waster. The plot then (such as it is) leads to a somewhat obvious theme of learning to grow up and take responsibility.Unfortunately, the paper-thin predictable plot only seems to serve to detract rather than add to the film's premise, which in itself grows slightly wearing after a while. Certainly there is a great novelty value in seeing a grown man eating, drinking, talking and fighting a talking teddy bear, and in hearing the bear swear and tell vaguely racially offensive jokes, but the novelty starts to wear off when the film tries to enter the more serious middle third. Fart jokes and an actual reference to Family Guy's Peter Griffin all serve to point out that this actually is all rather derivative after all. No doubt fans of MacFarlane's earlier work will love it (and will cry shame that MacFarlane remains 'misunderstood'), but they would no doubt have watched it anyway. And therein lies the problem. This almost feels like a feature-length live-action version of a Family Guy episode, which might be great for some, but it is unlikely to win any new fans to MacFarlane's work. Most of the characterization is very simple and 2-dimensional, with Wahlberg himself, for all the film's message of taking responsibility and growing up, not actually developing much as the film goes on, leaving the audience to wonder why on earth the similarly-bland Mila Kunis is with him in the first place. The rest of the supporting cast are little more than paint-by-numbers stereotypes, particularly Joel McHale as Lori's sleazy boss, while the underused Giovanni Ribisi could have been something interesting, had his wannabe-bear owner Donny been given more than a few minutes of screen time here and there. However, Patrick Stewart's opening and closing voiceovers do provide some genuine laughs, and hearing Captain Picard/Professor Xavier swear is quite an eye- (and ear-) opening experience! Having said all that, Ted does contain a large number of genuinely funny lines (even if a lot of them do appear in the trailers) and did produce a few laugh-out-loud moments, particularly with the numerous references to 80s movies, although sense of taste and political correctness may need to be left at the door. A liberal sprinkling of the F-word (and isolated stronger swearing) ensures that this film should definitely not be mistaken for a family-friendly film. In the end, Wahlberg and Kunis do not need to do a great deal, and allowing themselves to be out-acted by a computer-generated teddy bear in a predictable growing-up plot line, while slightly embarrassing for their CVs, somehow does not detract from the overall appeal of the film. There is something about the predictability, and seeing the friendship endure between Johnny and Ted that is both enjoyable and somehow strangely comforting. Just like a teddy bear.",8,0,2,17 March 2013
L.A. Confidential," This is how a proper crime story should be told!
","LA Confidential is a sprawling epic tale of crime, corruption and justice in Hollywood and the LAPD, with a cast to match. A truly gripping crime saga exposing the seedy underbelly of the City of Angels, where cops never let the truth get in the way of justice, and everyone knows everyone else's dirty secrets.Criminally overlooked at both the box office and the Academy thanks to the all-conquering and over-achieving Titanic, LA Confidential will far more likely stand the test of time to be thought of as one of the best films of the 90s, and possibly the best cop film ever.After cops give a number of inmates a beating in retaliation for two of their own being put in hospital, the career-minded Ed Exley (Guy Pearce) agrees to testify to what he saw, turning in his fellow officers. When one of the cops forced out turns up dead as a result of a shooting, Exley, hothead detective Bud White (Russell Crowe) and fame-obsessed Sergeant Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) all work to find the answers. However, as they uncover the truth, it leads to more questions, of corruption, blackmail, bribery and conspiracy.The film superbly portrays the dual nature of Hollywood; glamorous parties and beautiful people, and the seemingly ever-present crime and corruption, even in the police. Danny Devito's opening monologue perfectly sums it up - 'There's trouble in paradise'. This is not the city at the end of the rainbow, the city where dreams come true.A series of stellar performances from an all-star cast makes it impossible to pick the star, although Kim Basinger richly deserved her Best Supporting Actress. Kevin Spacey is terrific as ever, while Russell Crowe shows that Gladiator wasn't his first muscles-with-a-heart role. But the real standout is probably Guy Pearce in a career-making performance as the one officer determined to what is right and just, regardless of the potentially disastrous consequences for him. However, LA Confidential is a true ensemble piece, and everybody holds their own among the starry cast. Few will have made many better films, before or since.Curtis Hanson directs in a career-defining role, the sweeping direction echoing the sprawling nature of both the story and the city. The story is a slow-burner, gradually unraveling all the twists, but instead of clearing up the mystery, the waters become muddier as the trio of officers are forced to work together. Hanson masterfully commands the James Ellroy's source material, weaving it into a gripping multi-layered tale. The characters are extremely well developed, all three-dimensional, with no clear-cut heroes and villains. White (Crowe) in particular is the classic film noir anti-hero, the violent cop with a heart-breaking story, thinking with his muscles rather than his brain. LA Confidential is a classic 50s noir film told for the 90s, and keeps you guessing right up to the final scene as to how high the corruption goes. The two-hour running time is never felt.A superb thriller and the perfect antidote to the rash of mindless action-comedies that frequently come out of Hollywood today, LA Confidential harks back to how film-making used to be  all about telling a story. And what a story it is. One of, if not the best film of the 90s.",10,25,32,3 February 2006
Scary Movie 2," not scary, not funny, not even so bad its funny - but worse!
","most of the reviews I've written so far have been glowing or at least grudgingly good with a few criticisms. This is the first I've written where I can find no redeeming qualities about it. So why 2 stars? Well, it is only 79 minutes long, and Anna Faris is reasonably pretty. Thats about it though, and really the only reason it didn't get lower is because i simply don't like giving 1 out of 10 simply because of the work that goes into making any film - but this film comes closer than almost any other I've seen.Whereas the first Scary Movie, whilst not exactly brilliant, was a relatively original spoof of Scream and I know what you did last summer, with some genuinely funny moments, Scary Movie 2 has none of these. Furthermore, the first film stuck to poking fun at horror films, whereas this abomination of a sequel frequently meandered off aimlessly into other films, most notably a Charlie's Angels sequence. With the exception of the Wayans Brothers and Faris, the majority of the 'names' from the first film are absent - not that their presence could have salvaged this road accident of a film. What on earth were Tim Curry and James Woods thinking? The jokes are purile and immature, and their crude nature make the humour from the first film look like an Oscar Wilde play. Surely there are only so many times projectile vomiting and bodily functions can be amusing? and surely they are before the age of 15? (incidentally, this film is an 18, but it surely cannot have been aimed at over-18s).The film starts only reasonably bad with a spoof of the exorcist, and, whilst never approaching the comedy of the first (that in itself not a great challenge to meet), it is watchable. Its all downhill from there though. As spoofs go, Spaceballs it ain't. By the end you are simply crying out for whatever serial killer they are spoofing at present to slash up them or, failing that, you. The tag-line read more laughs, more screams, less clothes - inaccurate on all three counts.I've never given a film such a slating before, so this is a novel experience for me, and oddly a rather calming one too. The only scare to come out of this film is the prospect of a third film, and even a rumoured fourth in the franchise in the works. A truly terrifying prospect indeed.",2,3,6,15 April 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A truly exceptional film
","There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films.

Van Helsing," 2 hours of mindless fun
","Van Helsing is one of those films which most people will either really enjoy, or really enjoy ripping to shreds. If you are a person who sees films as something to be taken seriously, then stay away. If however you go to the cinema or rent a DVD simply for entertainment, then this is ideal.Director Stephen Sommers, with the Mummy films already under his belt, has produced a ridiculous but fun homage to early Universal classic horror films Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolfman. Calling it tongue-in-cheek would be a dramatic under-statement. The story is rather convoluted, but then it would take something original to fit all three of those Hollywood horror icons effectively into one story. But by never taking itself too seriously it largely side-steps any serious criticism of its' plot.Hugh Jackman revels in the Indiana Jones-esquire title role, which is a far cry from the Abraham Van Helsing of Bram Stoker's book (for one thing, he's a lot younger now with a different name!) and something else which is bound to infuriate the killjoys. Oops, sorry, I of course meant purists. Kate Beckinsale vamps it up again (almost literally) effectively reworking her role from Underworld, but her passion for the role seems to become lost under her heavy-handed Romanian accent. David Wenham though is a revelation in the role of Karl, Van Helsing's assistant, showing an impeccable sense of comic timing. Admittedly the lines are frequently horrendously corny, but that is part of the fun. Robbie Coltrane also has an excellent cameo as Mr Hyde early in the film. The only real criticism that can be levelled at the casting is Richard Roxborough's mis-casting as Dracula - the menace simply is not there, and he is more camp than count. Sesame Street's Dracula had more menace!But with excellent special effects (too often going unappreciated in this modern technological age) and a simple but fun story, this film is a perfect popcorn movie for a Saturday night. Just remember not to think too much!",8,12,24,15 April 2005
Collateral," Cruise control is outfoxxed!
","It is hard to lavish enough praise on the acting on display here from the two main protagonists. Jamie Foxx shows signs of the charisma and ability that made him a cert for the best actor Oscar for Ray. Meanwhile Tom Cruise is a sheer revelation as the psychotic but professional hit-man Vincent.Cabbie Max (Foxx) picks up Vincent (Cruise) expecting just another job. When Vincent offers to double his nightly earnings if he drives him all night he accepts, until Vincent's mission is revealed. What follows is a night of hell for Max, reluctantly driving Vincent from hit to hit, all the while trying to stay alive and do the right thing, two goals which may ultimately be unachievable together. What is most fascinating about Cruise's character though is the sheer indifference he shows towards his victims. He does not hate them, he doesn't even know them, he has just been assigned to kill them and does so with absolutely no remorse. When a body crashes on to his cab, followed by Vincent's re-appearance, Max is shocked by the answer to his accusatory 'you killed him!' - No, I shot him, the bullets and the fall killed him.' This matter-of-fact approach is indicative of Vincent's professionalism, and adds a really chilling level of apathy to the character.It is certainly refreshing to see Cruise in such a different role, and it is one which he really gets his teeth into, producing a sociopath contract killer, seemingly with no remorse and no redeeming qualities. He pulls it off with a genuinely sinister edge on the character, and the final half hour is particularly impressive from an acting point of view.Jamie Foxx however is certainly by no means acted off the screen. His likable cabbie with relaxed attitude to life (well, until he meets Cruise) shows many of the qualities he used to really bring Ray Charles to life later.The action too is well staged by Michael Mann, in probably his best work since Heat. It is easy to track the action through the relatively simple plot, and the set piece scenes are competently done without being spectacular. A very good above average thriller, but most notable for Cruise's revelation of another string to his acting bow. A superbly acted film.",8,105,142,28 June 2005
The Amazing Spider-Man," Simple effective reboot of a comic-book staple
","Comic book movies in recent years have tended to be greeted with great regularity with the description 'darker' or variations thereof. This culminated with the excellent but 'darker' Dark Knight Rises, which bordered on pitch-black and outright depressing. However, the latest incarnation of the Spiderman movie series, the reboot Amazing Spiderman has followed in the footsteps of The Avengers by lightening up and getting back to the roots of the comic, with puns and one-liners galore giving the film a much more entertaining vibe than the convoluted and take-themselves-too-seriously original trilogy. However, the comedy generally doesn't overshadow the story too much, and themes of loss and isolation are more deftly dealt with, making this new Marvel superhero film a more rounded experience, which again paves the way for yet another franchise.The Amazing Spiderman, which was born from Sam Raimi's aborted Spiderman 4 and wiped the slate clean of Tobey Maguire's stories, goes back to the beginning and focuses on Peter Parker's schooldays - a time period largely glossed over in the original films. Science again plays a big part in the genesis of both Spiderman and his latest nemesis - the Lizard. This time however, the science doesn't even attempt to make itself plausible, resulting in explanation that can be just accepted blithely without too much head-scratching. Otherwise, the story follows the -by-now standard origin story format, so no prizes for guessing any plot twists (such as they are): Hero starts life as an outsider in school, aptitude for science, freakish pseudo-scientific incident, tragic loss, responsibility of new powers, etc etc. Everyone knows how the story goes, yet seeing how it gets started is always enjoyable in comic-book adaptations, and this one is no different.In the perfectly-named Marc Webb's reboot, the red and blue spandex is taken on by Andrew Garfield, while Emma Stone's Gwen Stacy replaces Kirsten Dunst's Mary-Jane as the webslinger's love interest. Both do an adequate job, although Garfield is perhaps too perfectly groomed, buffed and coiffed to play the geeky, nerdy wimp that is Spiderman's alter ego. Martin Sheen and Sally Field are perfectly suitable as Garfield's surrogate parents, but the real standout of the piece is Rhys Ifans - of Notting Hill and 51st State fame - in a surprisingly understated and effective performance as Dr Curt Connors, the hero's mentor-come-reptilian nemesis.There are many things to enjoy about this latest Spiderman film, including allowing Parker to be a teenager, complete with requisite teen angst, school issues and romance, and there are also some interesting and amusing explorations of the hero's controversial new mechanical web-shooters, making Peter Parker 2.0 a more interesting superhero than Maguire's slightly one-dimensional responsibility-burdened Tarzan-with-webbing. The neat references to the comic-book lore are interesting and deft, without being hidden away so only the true comic book nerds notice them. However, with a run time of over 2 hours, the time taken for the iconic costume to make its first appearance does seem to drag at times, while the lack of the Jonah Jameson-type character feels like a hole in the story.Interestingly, given the somewhat lightened tone of this new Spiderman film, the music has changed from a largely bombastic and anthemic rock soundtrack to a more cerebral classical-led score, with only Coldplay the solitary nod to pop music. Yet somehow this counterbalances the comedic touches that threaten occasionally to drag the first half of the film down into parody, resulting in a well-rounded film. Overall, while it is unlikely this film will win any original screenplay awards, particularly given the mere decade that has passed since the original, The Amazing Spiderman is an enjoyable entry into Marvel's comic book film adaptation canon, dealing deftly with the familiar themes without beating the audience over the head with them like Thor's sledgehammer.",8,3,6,17 March 2013
Independence Day," Simply a great fun movie
","OK, If you are wanting a film that examines the meaning of life or some such other philosophically clever question, then you might as well stop reading now, for Independence Day certainly ain't for you. What it is is 2 hours of bam-splat mindless action, and a lot of fun. It is a film like this that reminds people what the movies were invented for - entertainment, pure and simple.The preposterous premise (well, a film like this had to have one) is aliens have come to annihilate life as we know it on earth. It then falls to a few plucky survivors, led by an heroic President of Earth (sorry, USA) to stave off the evil aliens' diabolical plans to use our planet for their own devious ends. That, basically, is it. A simple plot though is essential for a film where you just want to switch off, sit back and enjoy the show, and Independene Day delivers. Just make sure you realise at the outset that the film has its tongue firmly embedded in its' cheek. It is not a film to take seriously.Will Smith plays Will Smith (as he always does), in the form of a Captain in the United States marine air force. He is aided and abetted by the anally retentive genius Dr Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), the aforementioned gung-ho president (Bill Pullman), and an ex-marine (Randy Quaid) who has been abducted by the invaders before, and whose warnings have gone unheeded for years. Together they must dust off the rubble and beat off the aliens with a lot of big bangs and explosions.This was one of Smith's first films on the back of the success of the Fresh Prince TV series, and his wisecracking routine is therefore still relatively fresh and humorous here. OK the dialogue is horrendously corny, yet somehow endearing because of (or maybe in spite of) it. The jokes come thick and fast between the explosions, making Smith the perfect popcorn-movie actor. The lines are frequently laugh-out-loud bad, so bad they're good - 'I have got to get me one of these,' 'Elvis has left the building' and 'Now that's what I call a close encounter!' being just some standout ones.The special effects are excellent (and deservedly won an Oscar), the standout moment being the full-frontal blow-out of the White House. Never let it be said that Emmerich wasn't daring! (In case anyone still isn't sure, he goes on to prove it again in The Day After Tomorrow.)The American jingoism is often hideously over-powering at times, to the extent where you want to stick two fingers down your throat as the world flocks to America's banner. Thank God for the Americans! seems to be the film's message to the rest of the world. Just wait for the President's inspiring speech on the eve of the final attack and his subsequent personal entry into the battle. What a guy! The Hollywood ending is so sugary it should carry a health warning as it may rot your teeth. But for all that, the movie is tremendous film, and if you can refrain from letting the incredulousness of it affect your viewing pleasure, then this is the perfect matinée entertainment. Just sit back and enjoy.",10,1,4,8 May 2005
The Butterfly Effect," Very surprising - Kutcher can make decent films?!
","And now, as a great man once said, for something completely different. Having seen the cast for The Butterfly Effect, I was rather reluctant to go and see it (Dude where's my car, Just Married, and the like i never saw as great cinema somehow!) but I was persuaded to watch it and am I glad I did! I was not expecting such an original and innovative film.The basic premise is that Evan Treborn has had blackouts since he was young, and so has kept a diary to try and help him keep track. Years later when he's older he discovers that by re-reading the diary entries where he had blackouts he can return and fill in the gaps and attempt to change things - usually with unforeseen and some unfortunate consequences. As he shifts through alternative possible lives his situation radically changes, and he eventually he discovers that no matter what changes he makes to the timeline, it will cause devastating consequences for someone. The film is based on the philosophical premise that when a butterfly flaps its wings in New York, there's a thunderstorm in Tokyo, or some such thing, and it turns out to be a fascinating concept. This plot line leads to some superb unexpected and intriguing alternate realities, all very diverse, and make you wonder how things might have been different for you had you made some different choices.Kutcher belies his previous work and proves he is an actor of some talent, and the supporting cast, including the beautiful Amy Smart (again with not very promising filmography - Road Trip anyone?) all prove their talent, as they in effect have to play a number of different characters - or at least the same basic characters but with radically different personalities.The film keeps you guessing throughout and has some very surprising twists. It is a film I highly recommend watching, and even if you hate the usual Ashton Kutcher American Pie-type comedy, take heart for this is something completely different. It is worthy of buying but if possible try to get the Director's Cut. However, be warned - this Director's ending is rather grim and shocking, but somehow feels right in a weird sort of way, as it avoids the tired cliché Hollywood ending where it all turns out alright in the end. Overall an excellent and surprising film.",9,0,2,10 April 2005
Batman Begins," Simply superb!
","Finally a film which lives up the hype, and more. If George Clooney killed Batman, Christian Bale has well and truly brought him back to life, with a vengeance. Batman Begins is as about as far removed from the Joel Schumacher-inspired disaster that was Batman and Robin as is possible to be. Where Schumacher seemed to just throw a full palette of colour at the film, Christopher Nolan has returned to Batman's roots, and has brought back the original, and definitive Dark Knight. He is once again the heroic anti-hero, and not the cut-from-the-template typical clean-cut hero that Schumacher turned him in to. Spiderman/Peter Parker he ain't. The new Batman is a much darker creature, not solely driven by the inane desire to do good. Instead he is revealed to be a much more complicated individual, angry, grief-stricken.and driven by desire to wreak vengeance on the criminal underworld of Gotham City that took his parents from him.The film reflects this new, less clean-cut, almost more sinister Batman. The tone is one of a delicious darkness, with precious little sunlight allowed in. Taking it's source material from the Batman: Year One comics, the campness of the 1960s Adam West series is well and truly gone. And no Robin in sight! The plot is an unusual one though, as rather than having just one nemesis to battle, he faces many different foes throughout the film, highlighting the desolate, God-forsaken nature of Gotham, and the size of Batman's task to restore justice to the city - and mirroring the task of director Nolan to resurrect the Batman franchise!However, this darkness is more than compensated for by the sheer star power present in the film. Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman, Linus Roache, Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Katie Holmes, and Ken Watanabe all provide superb stellar support. Caine in particular clearly revels in the role of Alfred, Bruce Wayne's butler and mentor. Oldman, playing completely against type, is the world-weary but honest sergeant Gordon (obviously destined to become Commissioner Gordon) and, for a man so often a brilliantly effective bad guy, is surprisingly believable as a nice guy.The star of the piece though, is of course Christian Bale. The ultimate method actor who famously slimmed down to a walking skeleton for the Machinist, after bulking up for American Psycho, has regained his former muscular frame to be Bruce Wayne. He brings a new intensity to the role which really captures the full essence of being Batman, something even Michael Keaton did not fully manage.The film has everything required to be a top film. Adrenaline-pumping action, a wide array of gadgets, an exhilarating car chase and a fight against evil (as well as the obligatory romance). But the important core of the story is one of a man's struggle with himself, the fight to find a purpose for his life amidst his inner conflict, and overcome his own demons of grief and anger. At the film's heart is a real human story, and all the action and gadgets serves to amplify rather than obscure or pad out the film.Most probably the best Batman yet, the way is set for Bale to don the cape once more in a sequel to the prequel, and for once it will be a sequel welcomed with open arms. The only question remains at the end is whether or not this film (or films) will tie in with Tim Burton's original Batman, or if it will plough its own, new path. The intriguing ending leaves both options open.",10,1,1,26 June 2005
Saving Private Ryan," The best war film ever
","Possibly the best war movie ever, both in terms of story and visuals. No other war film has managed to convey the constant hell that was World War II whilst at the same time illustrating the bonds of comradeship between soldiers quite so effectively and movingly. The film manages to be realistically graphic in its depiction of war and its associated death and injuries, without being gratuitous with the claret. No punches are pulled.The story opens with the D-Day landings on Omaha beach, filmed with brutal realism, and then moves on to the mission of eight men who go behind enemy lines to rescue one man. Each of the men begin to question their orders, their place in the war, and the cost to their humanity.The film won countless awards for its realism and its harrowing story, including Steven Spielberg garnering the Best Director Oscar. At the same time however it never tries to present itself as historical fact, rather a historical scenario with a fictional story placed on top. The main mission may be fictional, but the sub-plots (such as the importance of defending the bridge) are definitely based on fact. Tom Hanks is superb as Captain Miller, the man assigned to lead the retrieval unit sent behind enemy lines. Ed Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel all provide competent performances as brothers-in-arms, and Tom Sizemore is (unusually) the rather understated Sergeant. The men form a strong bond (a bond between men which would Spielberg would explore further with his Band of Brothers mini-series) whilst undergoing a dehumanization process with regards to their enemy. Matt Damon has little more than a cameo as the eponymous Ryan. The film is both moving and gripping, and the 150-minute running time is barely felt, such is the intensity the subject matter is dealt with. Further, such was the impact of the film that several scenes (in particular the storming of Normandy beach) were almost shot-for-shot recreated in the computer game Medal of Honor: Allied Assault. The apparent waste of resources on this rescue mission (a waste which is highlighted and questioned by the soldiers in the chosen unit) is not only a poignant story but also serves to highlight the sheer frustration of the waste and pointlessness of war in general. Together with Schindler's list, Steven Spielberg has created two films which are probably the finest monument to the Second World War and its atrocities of modern times, and with these also cements his place as the finest director of his generation.",9,1,2,8 December 2005
2012," Bonkers
","Overblown, over-dramatic, ridiculous, and absolutely ludicrous – this is probably the best way to describe Roland Emmerich's latest offering. It is a sentiment that even NASA agrees with, as 2012 was named as the most absurd science fiction film of all time. Comedian Dara O'Briain has taken the opportunity to poke fun at the lunacy of the plot and science behind it. North Korea even banned the film for ridiculing such an important year for the country. Yet if you just accept the madness, then 2012 is a tremendously fun and entertaining film.The 'plot' stems from some scientific idiocy which isn't worth explaining, and leads to the planet pretty much blowing itself up, with multiple volcanoes, earthquakes and tsunamis devastating the world. What follows is the typical mass panic, and everyday people stepping to the fore. John Cusack stars as Jackson Curtis, a novelist turned limo driver who races against the planet exploding all around him in order to save his family and get them to safety in China. At the same time, the governments pontificate about what to do and try to look heroic and selfless while doing it. Yet Cusack is not outdone by his costars, including Danny Glover as the heroic President, Chiwetel Ejiofor as the scientist trying to warn the government, Amanda Peet as the hero's ex-wife, and the ever-watchable Oliver Platt as the slime-ball chief of staff trying toseize the opportunity. All the characters you would expect. Nothing complicated about it.But for Roland Emmerich, it is not the plot that he likes to complicate, but the special effects. For it is this that really makes 2012 such a viewable and entertaining film. Emmerich has always liked his set-piece detonations of landmarks (White House and Statue of Liberty in Independence Day, the Hollywood sign in Day After Tomorrow) but he really raises the bar this time, with some quite mind-blowing special effects scenes that make his previous efforts look like small-budget indies! Volcanoes erupting and causing entire continents to shift and fall into the sea is ambitious, even for Emmerich, but the scenes are exhilarating and spectacular; genuine 'wow' moments that are what the cinema was made for in the first place. Obviously at the same time you will be screaming 'as if!' at the screen, or rolling your eyes like marbles as various forces of nature propel vehicles, people and landmasses across the screen, but that all adds to the fun. It is simply wonderfully stupid!However, while the dialogue is corny and clunky, the characters are stereotypical and one-dimensional, with little interesting about them, and the plot, for all the wonderful explosions, is predictable and by the numbers, it is surprisingly edge-of-the-seat. Much fun could be made about the frequent 'just in the nick of time' nature of escapes, and lava moving at a very convenient (and strangely variable) pace, but then realism isn't exactly the film's strong suit! If you enjoy typical average disaster films then 2012 is certainly worth seeing, as it is a disaster film that is above average, particularly visually. The film has no pretensions about what it is, so audiences should certainly not be disappointed. The lack of depth to the characters make it difficult to fully engage and invest emotionally in the film, but in terms of visual thrills, 2012 is brilliant, adrenaline-pumping fun.",8,1,2,15 January 2011
Million Dollar Baby," Wow!
","Million Dollar Baby is one of those films which leaves you sitting in silence as the end credits roll. The silence is one of awe, but also one akin to being unable to speak after being floored by a sucker punch. 'I didn't see that coming' will be the prevalent thought.The film starts predictably enough; a 31-year-old girl (Swank) wishes to become a champion boxer, and to achieve that she seeks the best trainer around: Frankie (Eastwood). Although he initially refuses she continues to train and, after Frankie's friend (Freeman) intervenes and convinces him, he decides to train her. Under Eastwood's coaching she progresses rapidly, ultimately earning a championship shot. At this point you would be forgiven for believing this film to be a simple boxing movie, a female version of Rocky. However, Eastwood and writers Paul Haggis and F.X. Toole have loftier ideas than this, and it is here the knockout punch is delivered to the audience, taking the film in a radically new direction.The film cleaned up at the Academy Awards, and deservedly so, for it is a truly great piece of film-making. Eastwood and Swank are certainly worthy of their awards (for Best Director and Best Actress respectively) but it is Freeman who is the outstanding turn here. In a typical understated role, as both Frankie's friend and the narrator, it is he who lends the film sincerity and gravitas. His chemistry with Eastwood in particular is excellent, thanks partly through their prior experience together on Eastwood's earlier Unforgiven. Freeman has long been a mainstay of Hollywood, and his Best Supporting Actor award is both richly earned and long overdue.Eastwood's handling of some delicate material towards the end of the film, although brave, is commendable, and the change in direction, whilst not quite a twist on the level of The Usual Suspects, is an intriguing one. Overall a rather harrowing film, and although it is a film to be savoured, it is not one that can be watched comfortably a second time.",9,0,0,8 April 2005
The Dark Knight," Amazingly, lives up to the hype and more
","For the second entry into the (very) successfully rebooted Batman franchise to live up to expectations was never going to be easy. Batman Begins had met with critical acclaim and set the tills ringing at the box office, so people were already expecting great things of the follow-up, and with the death of Heath Ledger shortly after the completion of filming, it ensured that all of the world's attention was going to be on this film. So expectations of a great film were high.To a large extent, The Dark Knight not only meets, but exceeds those high expectations. With Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman all returning, much of what was good about the first film remains, and the addition of Aaron Eckhart and Maggie Gyllenhaal have proved to be successful moves. With the performance of Heath Ledger however, objectivity was always going to be difficult, with talk of a posthumous Oscar circling the film's promotion almost immediately after his death.It seems to be said of any sequel, particularly in a comic book franchise, that the second installment must be 'darker'. Sometimes this is indeed the case, sometimes the label appears to be applied as a knee-jerk reaction. The Dark Knight however is the first sequel in a long time to genuinely deserve this adjective (an impressive feat given that the first film was hardly brightly coloured!), all the way to the ending, to the extent that the film has met with criticism for its family-friendly 12A rating in the UK  some of the 'darker' scenes and plot elements are particularly intense and could be considered certainly unsuitable for children under 12. Yet The Dark Knight is still possibly the best film of the year so far.As for the plot itself, The Dark Knight revolves around Batman's desire to step down and allow new District Attorney Harvey Dent (Eckhart) to fight the criminals out in the open. However, the rise of the Joker (Ledger) forces Bruce Wayne to return to his alter-ego, and go even 'darker' in order to bring him down. For a runtime over two and a half hours, the plot never gets too convoluted but is involving enough so that the long runtime is not felt too much (although shaving a quarter-hour off wouldn't have hurt). However, although The Dark Knight is a superb ensemble piece (as was Batman Begins) with some terrific action set-pieces (including car chases and explosions) the film's star is by far and away Heath Ledger, in what has proved to be a tremendously fitting swansong to a promising career cut way too short. Even allowing for all the inevitable hyperbole following his death, Ledger's performance is absolutely superb. He truly makes the character his own, and resists what must be a great temptation to overact and try and echo the performance of Jack Nicholson, yet still manages to capture the maniacal quality that is the Joker. Which makes it all the more tragic that this career-defining performance should be seen after his death.But in all of the furore over Ledger's death, it would be easy to overlook the performance of the Caped Crusader himself (and bonus points for Christopher Nolan for managing to crowbar in that nickname into the film without making it seem too camp). But Christian Bale as the eponymous hero matches Leger's joker for intensity and the always-required darkness. It is his performance that makes the Joker such a perfect match for Batman, and probably the greatest comic-book villain ever. And in Aaron Eckhart a new star has been discovered, as his role as Dent the DA and his descent to Two-Face. Meanwhile Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman and Michael Caine are all as reliable as ever.Best of all, the ending leaves open the possibility of a completion to the trilogy  and although so-called 'threequels' are almost universally a disappointment, the unparalleled success of this reboot to one of the greatest comic-book franchises of all time means that it would be a completion eagerly anticipated. Memories of the ridiculous camp of Adam West, and the catastrophe of Joel Schumacher are now well and truly banished.Exciting, adrenaline-fuelled, compelling, and, yes, darker. The Dark Knight is a fantastic film, and in a summer over-filled with comic-book adaptations, needs something special to stand out. And in Heath Ledger's tremendous performance it has it. Maybe the posthumous Oscar would be justified after all.",10,6,13,26 July 2008
Taken," A gripping action thriller surprisingly heavy on the violence
","Taken is a taut action thriller starring the somewhat improbable Liam Neeson as the avenging hero.Neeson is somewhat of an everyman actor, very believable in everyday hero roles that Tom Cruise and the like could never do. It is this versatility that is his great strength as an actor – see his roles as Jedi Qui-Gon Jinn in Star Wars and the legendary Irish hero Michael Collins in the film of the same name for further evidence of this. But as Brian Mills, the loving father and retired CIA operative, he brings a new intensity to the fore, and the film is all the more satisfying for it. Brian has seen how the world works and wants to protect his daughter from it. But after his daughter is kidnapped on a trip to Paris, Brian must dust off his skills that have lain dormant in order to rescue his daughter and punish those responsible.After taking a little too much time to set events in motion (considering it is only a 90 minute film) the pace and power accelerates rapidly, and you find yourself slowly gripped by the single-minded intensity of ex-spy Ben. While you remain sure that the outcome is inevitable, the method and projected body count remain in question, and it is this that makes the film such an enthralling tale. Some good, if not particularly spectacular, set-pieces, keep the pace moving quickly, while the vast range of 'special skills' Ben displays throughout the film ensure we never lose sight of who it is we're dealing with. The film wears its emotions on its sleeve, giving the film a raw feel, which all adds to the gut-wrenching intensity. As the plot thickens and more layers become apparent – including corruption within the gendarmes – you are left asking yourself 'how far would you go to rescue someone you love? What lengths would you go to?' Ben's methods become morally ambiguous at best, if not outright questionable, but as we see more of the seedy underbelly of Paris and how far it extends, the slightly sour taste that has been growing from the we discover the truth behind his daughter's abduction becomes quite uncomfortable. The rather surprisingly high level of violence adds to this level of discomfort, yet the violence never seems to feel gratuitous.Neeson is a man who can deliver quiet intensity like few others can, but the fury he displays never seems to rise much above a whisper – no matter how much training a spy may get, surely nothing could prepare someone for the kidnap of their daughter? A slight increase in volume of emotions would have benefited somewhat. Meanwhile, Maggie Grace as Ben's daughter has little to do other than look severely distressed and frightened, while the villains are largely nameless and faceless. The lack of a single clearly identifiable villain, while ensuring the focus remains solely on Ben's search for his daughter, dilutes the fury and vengeance factor somewhat. However, Taken remains a riveting narrative, unfettered by the convoluted machinations that frequently litter CIA-based films. By taking the spy out of the CIA, the story is free to focus on the action-based thrills rather than the political ones, and is all the better for it. In fact, with a sub-90 minute runtime the audience is left feeling slightly short-changed on plot, and an additional twenty minutes to develop Neeson's character further, maybe even displaying some bursts of uncontrolled rage at some point, would not have harmed the movie in any way.Be that as it may, with TV series like Alias having made the spy genre somewhat stale, Taken shows there is no substitute for seeing this kind of story as a full-blown action thriller on the big screen. Genuinely gripping.",9,2,4,11 April 2009
From Hell," Johnny Depp as excellent as ever
","A fresh retelling of the Jack the Ripper legend was probably due, and this Hughes Brothers piece is just the job. It remains faithful to the story whilst throwing in one or two potentially controversial aspects that will leave audiences horrified, but also with a number of talking points.***Spoilers*** The potential link of Jack the Ripper to the royal family has been rumoured for decades but has never been proved. Although this film might have benefited from remaining slightly more ambiguous, nevertheless it is a fascinating tale, though viewers of a nervous disposition are advised that blood abounds.Johnny Depp, as ever, gives a solid performance whilst always injecting human interest into the role. Heather Graham's performance is good but not spectacular, and her Irish accent is a little shaky. Robbie Coltrane is his usual bustling, robust self, and even in the most serious of roles he can be looked to to provide some comedic relief, and he can always convey his relishing of the role. Ian Holm brings the required gravitas to the performance.A superb and fascinating but rather grisly tale, this is not the average mindless Saturday night entertainment, but an excellent murder mystery, and a much needed de-mystifying of the tale.",8,0,2,9 April 2005
Inside Man," A twisty tense heist thriller that will leave you scratching your head
","Inside Man is a clever film that fits the bill perfectly for a Saturday evening's entertainment – a complex thriller that, while never too complicated, leaves you on numerous occasions thinking you have a handle on what is happening, only for the film to surprise you again. A classy heist thriller with modern twists, and a stellar leading cast, it keeps you guessing right the way through, which makes it ideal evening viewing, and at almost exactly two hours is probably just the right length. There seems to be hidden depths to all the characters in a multi-layered plot, where as questions are answered, even more are asked. Much discussion will ensue as the credits roll.Clive Owen plays Dalton Russell, a master criminal who has planned what he believes to be the perfect bank robbery, whilst Denzel Washington is the detective who must resolve the situation, and Jodie Foster is the big shot hard nosed negotiator working for the benefit of 'outside interests'. Supporting this A-list leading group includes Chiwetel Ejiofor (who seemed to be in nearly every film released that year), Willem Dafoe and Christopher Plummer.The film uses the interesting format of interspersing the main film with brief scenes of witness/suspect interviews in the aftermath, all the while keeping the identities of the robbers concealed (with the exception of Owen, who announces his intentions at the start) so the interviewees could be anyone. What makes the scene more interesting is the complete and very distinct lack of lawyers for the interviewees. This proves to be a rather effective and innovative technique, as are the interesting mix of sympathies. The detectives dealing with the hostage situation and the interviews in the aftermath are not necessarily as warm and heroic as you might expect, in fact almost intimidating, while Foster's power broker and Owen's lead bank-robber are multi-layered, making for much more interesting characters, especially as they are used comparatively sparingly, while Washington's detective fills a large portion of the screen time – fortunately as a top quality actor he is equal to the task, although he does come across as slightly callous and unsympathetic. Denzel's unusual and cold characterisation makes the viewing uncomfortable for the viewer, and certainly alters the viewers sympathies. Meanwhile, Foster is particularly excellent as the ice-cold bitch negotiating on behalf of a third party, while Owen has some strangely effective cold charisma as the lead bank robber. Plummer and Dafoe are given very little to do however, while Ejiofor seems little more than a sycophantic sidekick for Washington, and he contributes nothing – unusual given his strong performances in other films round the same time such as Serenity and Four Brothers.With the emphasis on slowly-rising tension and very little action as the mast plan of the criminals becomes clear, Inside Man is a gripping tale of how to rob a bank – almost playing as an instruction manual for would-be armed robbers. In addition, what sets the film apart is that far from there being an obvious outcome as is the case with similar films, there seems to be a real feeling that someway, somehow, the robbers might actually get away with it and win. YOu never know what is going to happen. This makes for an incredibly refreshing film. Movie buffs will also love being able to play spot the movie reference – Sudden Impact, Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon are all clearly referenced, almost as if the film is an homage to the great crime and heist movies of the past. Inside Man is also one of few 15-rated films that make use of the c-word.Overall a gripping heist thriller that will still have you scratching your head as the end credits roll, wondering not only how it happened, but what actually happened as well. A film that definitely warrants repeat viewings - make space on your DVD shelf, as you will want to watch it again.",8,2,3,29 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Best so far
","So now Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) enters his fourth year at Hogwarts, and as usual someone has it in for him. Upon returning to school (after an all-too-brief brief sojourn to the Quidditch World Cup Final) Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) announces the Tri-Wizard Tournament, and for reasons far too complicated to be explained here (or properly in the film) Harry winds up as the fourth competitor in this three-way tournament, thanks to the eponymous Goblet. There then follows three tasks to determine the champion. However, the story will not end there, and Voldemort, who has had merely teasing mentions and appearances up until now in the series, is finally revealed.Let's start with the positives first of all, and there are plenty of them. Overall, by far the best thus far in the franchise, for both fans of the books and those who just watch the films. Certainly the most exciting, and visually spectacular, dwarfing the previous three films. The book has five action set pieces, and four of them were done superbly - the Quidditch World Cup final at the start was effectively cut from the film, but I'll get to that later. The three tasks and the final showdown with Voldemort are all terrifically done (maybe a little CG-heavy, but what fantasy epic would be complete nowadays without that?) Director Mike Newell, the third director entrusted with steering the franchise, also deserves commendation for his handling of the more everyday aspects of the story  most notably his young stars' emergence into adolescence. It is a joy to see the obvious improvement in the performances of Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (Ron) and Emma Watson (Hermione). Rupert Grint in particular seems untroubled by the portrayal of a teenage angst-ridden 14-year-old, and his performance  mainly grunting and swearing  appears very little stretch for him. Emma Watson too is finally blossoming into a fine actress after rather wooden earlier performances and definitely holds her own well here. There is also a rather good turn by newcomer Katie Leung as Cho Chang, an Asian girl with, bizarrely but sweetly, a Scottish accent. Although little more than a cameo, her later importance is established. Her awkward scenes with Harry make for some cringingly accurate scenes to remind us (or forewarn the younger viewers) of our own awkwardness when it came to boys and girls in school. Also wonderfully teased is the ongoing Ron-Hermione sparks.One of the film's, and series, most important aspects is as the characters grow, so do the films, and Goblet of Fire is no different. The fourth film is a much darker affair, even compared to Prisoner of Azkaban, and has thus garnered a 12A rating  a potential death sentence. However, the 12A is essential given the material, and much darkness is both required and delivered. In particular the climactic graveyard scene with Voldemort, while deliciously dark for older viewers, may prove upsetting for younger children.Newcomers to the franchise include Brendan Gleeson, David Tennant and Ralph Fiennes. Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody is clearly having a ball, and rather over-indulges himself as the mad professor and new Defence Against the Dark Arts Teacher. Tennant only appears briefly, but seems keen to avoid typecasting as Doctor Who before it begins, and thus enjoys playing a slightly unhinged new villain  with hopefully more to come. The undoubted star however is Ralph Fiennes, who is quite simply perfect as the great baddie himself  Voldemort. A genius piece of casting. Also watch for a great cameo from Eric Sykes as an elderly gardener who falls foul of Voldemort at the film's opening.Criticisms will no doubt come thick and fast from fans. Obviously at 700+ pages a lot would be cut. But even allowing for this, a great deal of exposition seems missing, and the first half set-up in particular seems to be whistled through at breakneck pace, as if to get to the main story quickly and waste as little time as possible on background. As a result, the potentially spectacular Quidditch final is reduced to a mere triviality, and other plot lines and scenes fall by the wayside. Mrs Weasley is cut altogether from the film, as are the dastardly Dursleys, and the scene of the Weasley family exploding out of the Dursley fireplace and into their living room would have provided welcome comic relief from the darkness which top and tail the film. Gone too is Hermione's elvish welfare campaign and much of Miranda Richardson's part as Rita Skeeter the tabloid hack (a none-too-subtle dig by JK Rowling). Furthermore, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are reduced to little more than cameos, and poor Gary Oldman has to make do with an appearance of his face in a fireplace. How he appears in the fireplace in the first place is one of many things not explained too clearly for non-readers of the books. Obviously it will be left to the easy cop-out of 'well it's magic isn't it? Jason Isaacs also pops up for a cameo as Lucius Malfoy to remind us he'll be important later, and his rather English brand of villainy is simply superb  understated but undeniably effective, even with less than half-a-dozen lines.Overall though the positives far outweigh the negatives, and though fans of the book will definitely quibble over the missing material, the end product is mostly faithful to the story, perhaps even more so than the previous films. Greatly enjoyable, and a good sign for the future of the franchise, which has begun to grow up well. Harry Potter the franchise appears to be in safe hands for the time being, which is unfortunately more than can be said for the eponymous hero himself.",8,0,0,4 December 2005
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," A 21st century True Lies?
","Not quite, but it does share the same spirit  big guns, fast cars, cool gadgets, pretty people, and good fun. And ever so slightly bonkers.Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are the eponymous couple, and are the typical American suburbanites  live in a nice home, nice cars etc but seemingly their lives are in a rut. However they both have a secret from each other  they are both assassins, and working for rival companies. The rest of the plot writes itself so I won't regurgitate it here, but everything you can predict happen does.But that is not to say that the film's predictability makes it boring. Quite the reverse, and while the plot twists are hardly on the level of Bryan Singer, Doug Liman never intends to make that kind of film. What he has put together is an incredibly slick and shiny film with all the veneer we have come to expect from the man behind the Bourne Franchise. Furthermore, the film was written with one thing in mind - entertainment, and it certainly delivers that. In the spirit of True Lies, the action in the film flows thick and fast but never seems to take itself too seriously, and it is obvious that the actors are enjoying their work, throwing everything into the action. The action is never anything more than barely believable, but to criticise this point is to miss the point entirely.So what of the performance of Hollywood's latest 'First Couple'? Pitt and Jolie give slick performances and do well in the action scenes, but neither of them seem 100% comfortable with the tongue-in-cheek banter aspects of the film. Indeed, Pitt seems far more naturally relaxed interacting with co-worker Vince Vaughn rather than his (on and off-screen) wife. Given that this is the film where they reputedly began their love affair, this seems somewhat surprising  but then again, the gossip surrounding the production must have made for a slightly uncomfortable feeling on-set. This is not the taciturn but charismatic Pitt we came to admire in Seven and Fight Club, and perhaps it is the comedy that he is not keen on. Maybe he just did not want to be as hammy and corny as the great Arnie was in True Lies, and it is this which holds his performance back  caught between a desire to play it straight and the need to allow the comedy to come out a bit more.However their performances are still more than adequate and contribute to a greatly enjoyable film. The guns, the gadgets, the fast cars and the attractive leads all add up to a good old action adventure for the twenty-first century. Just disengage the brain and don't think too hard and you'll be fine.",8,1,4,24 July 2008
The Departed," Very good - but not very Goodfellas
","The Departed is a slow-burning simmering thriller, a tale steeped in deception, and gently, expertly brought to the boil - until a slightly overcooked finish leaving a slightly unsatisfying taste in the mouth.Martin Scorsese's latest is a very well told story by one of the greatest directors of all time, and while the Departed does show exactly why the great man is so highly thought of, it also hints that perhaps he is not quite at the peak of his powers anymore.The film is good, indeed it is very good, but the Oscars for best picture and director feel more like an apology from the Academy for overlooking Raging Bull, and particularly Goodfellas, rather than just recognition for this film. Yes, nobody does gangster films like Scorsese (unless Coppola wants to continue his Godfather saga), but while many directors would be proud to have 'The Departed' in their filmography, Goodfellas was far superior. The dialogue was sharper, the acting crisper, and the story more flowing.Yet the Departed remains an enjoyable film. Largely the feeling of two parallel intertwining stories feels very effective, with both Matt Damon and Leonardo DiCaprio providing a great deal of conflict in bringing their lead characters to life. Both are all contradictions - Damon is the cop who is a mole for the mob, and is smooth, charming, but yet somehow slightly bland, whilst DiCaprio as the man from the wrong side of the tracks handpicked for a special undercover assignment as a mole within the mob is a violent thug with a turbulent past but desperate to get his job done. With so much deception, you are never sure who knows what, and, rather appropriately, you feel like rats in a maze. And Scorsese does expertly time the reveals of information and keeps you guessing - but yet something about it feels ever so slightly underwhelming. However the action does heat up nicely towards the final third, with an interesting homage to the original by the use of a scene in Chinatown in Boston, creating some genuine edge-of-the-seat moments, until a rather unexpected conclusion that slightly jars against what has gone before.The acting however is uniformly excellent. One thing that can be said for Scorsese is that he sure can get the best out of DiCaprio, who here produces work to rival that of his portrayal of Amsterdam in Gangs of New York - another Scorsese picture. Damon however seems to be slightly lacking in charisma, although that does not provide a tremendous problem here. But it is the supporting actors who really steal the show. Jack Nicholson as the crime lord produces an atypically restrained performance - never overacting, and producing a quietly menacing performance, relying on his natural gravitas to still fill the screen whenever he is on it. Martin Sheen is as ever a class act, but the show-stealers are Mark Wahlberg as the intensely unlikeable but committed handler, and Alec Baldwin, who is given precious little screen time, but certainly makes the most of his scenes without scenery-chewing antics like those seen in Glengarry Glen Ross.Overall, while this is a worthy addition to the Scorsese canon, the unsatisfactory conclusion and some of the slightly unsatisfying reveals make this feel a somewhat inferior cousin to Goodfellas, rather than a true companion. Yet any other director would be proud of this work, and rightly so, as there is a great deal to take pleasure from. Maybe Scorsese just set his own standards too high for anyone, including himself, to live up to.",8,2,3,3 April 2007
Die Hard," The action movie that defined a generation - and spawned a thousand imitations!
","Die Hard is regularly ranked as the greatest of all the 80s action movies, and among the greatest of all time, and even 25 years later, it is not difficult to see why. Die Hard really is action film-making at its best, and began a new type of actioner - the everyman caught in a unique situation - that many films would try to copy; some more successfully than others, but none would ever measure up to the original. That even includes the 4 (and counting) sequels! It would launch the careers of Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman skyward - admittedly on different trajectories - and even become a bizarrely popular choice for a seasonal festive film each December! John McClane (Willis) is a New York cop who has travelled to Los Angeles to reunite with his estranged wife Holly (Bonnie Bedelia) at a Christmas party in a city skyscraper, when an armed band of villains march in with machine guns and take over, led by Alan Rickman's evil Hans Gruber, holding the partygoers to ransom. McClane must then work his way through the building, picking off the terrorists one by one, fighting a one-man war while the LAPD pontificates impotently on the doorstep.The recipe is incredibly simple, yet brilliantly effective; the ludicrous situation is tempered by the Regular Joe nature of Willis's character, allowing the audience to identify wholeheartedly with his efforts and motivations, while hissing at the Machiavellian machinations of arch-criminal Gruber. The action itself is replete with some superb and exciting shootouts, spectacular set pieces and a new level of violence not often seen in such a mainstream action film before now - just watch for the scene with the broken glass, and you'll be wincing for weeks! Bruce Willis so perfectly captured the essence of his character, that the image, hair and even name have become synonymous with action heroes for all movies hereafter. The iconic shaved head and dirty white vest perfectly captured the feel of the right man caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, but it was not just Willis's physique and wardrobe that made John McClane such a hero. His fight scenes are brutally brilliant, and his delivery of both threats and sarcastic one-liners will have audiences punching the air and chuckling in equal measure. His radio exchanges with Rickman's Gruber are superb, and his charming banter with Sgt Al Powell on the outside - also over radio - lend the character an extra warmth that could easily have been missed, which would have made the character slightly less sympathetic.But every great hero needs a villain, and Alan Rickman produced a performance of a lifetime; one which would lead him to being pigeonholed as a great British 'character actor' - Hollywood code for 'plays great villains!'. Admittedly this would lead him to even further success, most notably as the Sheriff of Nottingham in Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, and of course Professor Snape in the Harry Potter films, but it was unquestionably this role that set him on the role to a reputation as one of the greatest villainous actors of the twentieth century. His performance is never overstated, and without resorting to scenery-chewing, makes every single line positively drip with threat and menace. But he is also allowed a few light moments of his own in between his shooting of innocent bystanders - darkly comic interplay with the FBI outside in particular. His arrogant dismissive nature of the FBI while reeling off a list of names the group want freed is particularly black - his request for one group that he then mouths to his associate that he 'read about them in Time Magazine' a standout. His ability to produce a villain who is both positively loathsome and yet darkly charismatic makes Die Hard just as much Rickman's film as it does Bruce Willis's. Jeremy Irons' attempt to reproduce this balance in the film's third entry pales in comparison, producing a villain that is fun, but unfortunately occasionally too camp to be truly hissable.The majority of the other characters are generally rather 2-dimensional, in particular McLane's estranged wife Holly, whose character is unfortunately lacking much in the way of back-story that could have made Willis's mission even more effective, whilst the henchman are as typically anonymous as you might expect from such an actioner. The rest of the attendees at the party are also mostly anonymous, making it difficult for the audience to truly get invested in their fate.But such quibbles are unquestionably minor next to the brilliance of the whole, and such was the film's success that virtually every action film of its type would thus be labelled as the 'new Die Hard' or the even more derivative 'Die Hard on a plane/train/boat/submarine' (delete as applicable). So to see how films like Die Hard actioners should be done, it can only be Die Hard itself. A true era-defining film, one that even gained numerous name-checks in 'Friends' to demonstrate its iconic nature, that became a perfect template for all subsequent action films to follow.",9,3,3,25 March 2013
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Cracking action, cracking fun
","Die Hard With A Vengeance is probably the most fun film of the definitive action trilogy of the 80s and 90s. While Die Hard was certainly a gripping adrenaline-fuelled action thriller, and Die Hard 2 stuck closely to that formula, the third film decided that, whilst retaining the action, to cut loose and have fun.The third Die Hard film sees John McLane (Bruce Willis) tearing round New York trying to solve riddles set by the maniacal younger brother of Hans Gruber who he threw off a skyscraper in the first film. Meanwhile the rest of the NYPD are trying to deal with more real threats posed by the terrorist. In these kind of action films, common sense seems to go out of the window in terms of plot rationale anyway, but this time the 'as if' factor is tempered by a great sense of fun.The main source of entertainment however comes not from the plot itself but Samuel L Jackson, who plays a manic fast-talking wisecracking stereotypical black New Yorker named Zeus, with liberal use of the word 'ass' and other more colourful profanities. Jeremy Irons plays this round's bad guy, and plays a slightly more comical version of the first film's Hans Gruber. It seems that British actors have a monopoly on playing the bad guys in American blockbusters, but then again they do seem to do it so well. Meanwhile Bruce Willis faces little challenge in reprising his John McLane action role that, since the first Die Hard film, has become the template for virtually all action heroes, white vest and all.While the action in this film is slightly less explosive than the first two films, the tone is generally much lighter , as if the film has its tongue firmly embedded in its cheek. However the constant wisecracking often threatens to cause the film to descend into self-parody  a problem that has led to many dubbing this film the worst of the trilogy. But with the second film sticking closely to the formula of the first, the injection of freshness was definitely warranted, as if to combat an onset of the franchise being accused of taking itself to seriously. And while this freshness largely comes from Samuel L Jackson's stereotypical black New Yorker (Jeremy Irons villain is merely pantomime hissable) the film came at a time when the stereotype was not so widespread and parodied. Further, there are still plenty of adrenaline-charged action scenes. All in all this made Die Hard With A Vengeance a highly entertaining film. Maybe not the best of the three, but definitely the most fun.",8,0,0,5 March 2006
Hitch," No need for a spoiler warning - you know what you're gonna get
","Hitch Dir: Andy Tennant Cast: Will Smith, Eva Mendes, Kevin James, Amber VallettaIt is hard to know what to say when reviewing a Will Smith film, especially as many people will have already made up their minds what they think of the film before they have seen it. When it comes to Smith, most people fall into one of two camps; either they enjoy his wisecracking Fresh Prince routine, which he utilises in virtually all of his films, or they find it grating and cannot watch him.Hitch is just such a 'Fresh Prince' role, complete with the usual quips and wisecracks. However, as Will Smith vehicles go, this is one of his weaker efforts. The story is split evenly between his own love life and that of his latest client's (James). But while Smith is his usual likable self (if you like that role of course) the sequences with his client Albert are frequently uncomfortably cringe-worthy viewing. Although James tries his best, he is rarely convincing in the role of the beautiful Valletta's love interest. Never mind date doctor, Smith must be a date wizard to get her to fall for him that quickly.Mendes is equally unconvincing as Smith's love interest, and she fails to draw sympathy from the audience to the extent that you don't want the guy to get the girl. However, as with all romantic comedies, you know exactly what will happen, but even allowing for this it all feels rather contrived and corny. With vehicles such as this, it's no wonder Smith is struggling to be taken seriously as an actor. Enjoyable though his persona can be, the joke is starting to wear thin.",6,0,3,9 April 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Much better
","Better than the other two prequels? Yes. Good as the holy trilogy? Not quite.While not quite a return to form, Sith is still a vast improvement on the earlier prequels, which were rather thoughtful and political. Sith is a return to what star wars does best - lots of battles! We were promised more light-saber action, more space dogfights. Well, the promise was kept - and more! The film opens with a space battle on a mind-boggling scale - reminiscent of Return of the Jedi, but more ships and more chaos! The plot begins with action, and keeps it packed throughout the 2 hours and 20 minutes, so you really do not notice the runtime at all. The light-saber battles are more frequent than in any other film, and considerably beefed up, and varied.Although there are numerous battles in the first half of the film, the first hour mainly sees all the pieces falling into place for the grand finale that Mr Lucas has been building towards since the Phantom Menace. The second half is where the proverbial will really hit the fan.Unfortunately, between the fight scenes, the first half of the film isn't as great as it could be. For one thing, there is just too much 'witty banter and slapstick' and the like; but this is forgivable given the overall dark nature of the film. The droid army seem to be providing comic relief in the first showdown, and R2-D2 seems to have become a comedy sidekick. He also seems to have numerous new gadgets, making him resemble a swiss army knife on wheels. The film also becomes rather soppy and slow in places in the aftermath of the opening sequence, with tepid exchanges between Anakin and Padme  very un-Star Wars.The dialogue is typical Lucas  corny to say the least. 'Another happy landing' is just one 'gem' from Mr McGregor, and of course where would a Star Wars film be without the required phrase 'I've got a bad feeling about this!' Sure enough it appears. But we have become so used to the scripting's unique nature that it has grown beyond criticism, it is simply accepted.The acting this time is much improved upon the last instalment. Hayden Christensen seems to visibly improve over the course of the film, and Ewan McGregor displays a superb new intensity (although the attempted Alec Guinness accent is rather wobbly). Samuel L Jackson is his usual charming self, but Natalie Portman is rather wet. The star though is the show-stealing Ian McDiarmid as Chancellor Palpatine, who hams it up superbly as the villain of the piece. He is clearly revelling in the role, and so obviously enjoys the chance to finally wield a light-saber of his own  red of course.Although the film is rather slow at first in between the fight sequences, it reaches a turning point with the final revelations about Palpatine and the confrontation with Jackson's Mace Windu. Here, finally we see the beginnings of Darth Vader  what everyone has come for. Ever since that little boy in Episode I announced himself as Anakin, we have known what was coming, and awaited it with baited breath. It has now arrived. With Anakin's final turn to the dark side, the pace of the film exponentially increases. The last hour simply whistles by, scarcely giving the audience time to draw a breath. And of course there is a new quote destined to become part of that legendary canon including 'May the force be with you' and 'If you strike me down.' Well, you know the rest of that. It is of course, that one simple word uttered by Palpatine to the newly christened Darth Vader: Riiiissssseee. It is said understatedly and dripping with menace. Fans however may feel aggrieved that it was not quite used as portrayed by the trailer.So, what warrants a 9 rating given the flaws already highlighted? Well, quite simply it is a return to the sheer adrenaline rush and excitement the original trilogy generated. While nothing may ever compare to that trench run at A New Hope's climax, the second hour of Sith makes a fair go of matching it. The sheer buzz of the joint climaxes of the Anakin-ObiWan and Palpatine-Yoda fights are tempered by the delicious darkness caused by the Jedi deaths and Anakin's descent into evil. It is a headying mix. The fight scenes are a wonder to behold, rivalling anything seen in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon for their intensity. The special effects, as always, are excellent. The lava planet Mustafar is a standout, creating the epitome of hell for Anakin to face his final demise into the suit of Vader.And what all fans wanted to see was how well it tied the prequels to the original trilogy? The answer is, with one or two minor quibbles, expertly. Lots of deft touches create links to the old films, and watch out for a blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameo from a Peter Cushing-lookalike at the very end. And of course the final link is made with the arrival of Luke and Leia, and the former's immediate departure to Tatooine with ObiWan.To an extent, the film fell victim to its own success even before it was even released thanks to the unprecedented hype it generated. The film simply didn't stand a chance of living up to the sky-high expectations placed on it, and critics have been so quick to slate the film you might think their minds were made up before seeing it. I suspect that some had written their scathing reviews even before they saw the film. With the film's inevitable success, it was going to be extremely fashionable to heckle it, whether it was justified or not.But although many critics will relish the opportunity to lay waste to the film, undoubtedly fans of the original trilogy will love it. And surely, that is all that matters.",9,1,3,20 May 2005
Music and Lyrics," The film equivalent of a comfort blanket
","There is something strangely comforting about Hugh Grant films. You always know exactly what you are going to get, and what you get is enjoyable, non-offensive gentle romantic comedy. OK, Hugh Grant will usually be playing Hugh Grant, (this is the case in pretty much all of his films) so his films are never likely to trouble Oscar, but for matinée idol entertainment there are few better. So because you always know what you are going to get, Hugh Grant rom-coms never have a problem living up to expectations  and that is no bad thing.In this latest offering, Grant is a washed-up 80s pop star looking to try and revive his career in some sort of comeback, whatever it takes (which seems a reasonable idea given the high number of reforming bands and comebacks around the current chart). He is asked by a Britney/Christina-alike pop diva to record a song for her. Struggling for inspiration, the lady who waters his plants contributes random lyrics, and a song is born as the two work together on the music and lyrics (clever title then huh?). It also helps that the plant-watering lady is played by the beautiful Drew Barrymore, so I won't bother recapping what happens next. Well there's no need is there? The film opens with a classic 80s-style pop video, showing Hugh Grant and his former bandmates in all their glory, a perfect example of 80s cheesy pop, complete with accompanying dance moves  and irritatingly catchy, so you will find yourself going away humming the damn thing all day. The rest of the soundtrack is surprisingly pleasant without being mindblowing, and is thus the perfect accompaniment to the film.As stated before, Grant is just his usual self  no real challenge for him anymore, so he seems completely at ease with his performance without really having to make much effort, and Barrymore is also her usual likable self. The supporting cast are all fine but with no real show-stealers like you sometimes get in these films. So while there is nothing outstanding about this film, it is still an enjoyable film, fun for all the family and inoffensive. Just don't be surprised or disappointed by it, because you know what you're going to get before the opening credits roll. Overall a slightly above-average comedy thanks to the likability of its two leads, relevance to today's charts, and a decent number of one-line gags  and the irritatingly catchy soundtrack! So why such a high rating if it is merely above average? Well quite simply, I enjoyed the film, maybe it is a guilty pleasure film, but in the end it all comes down to personal preference. I enjoyed it, so there.",8,0,0,10 April 2007
Scream," Iconic, unique, fresh, a definitive new horror
","Scream With the countless number of teen slasher movies doing the rounds, it is too easy to watch scream and see simply another school serial killer movie that has just rolled off the factory production line. However, it was Wes Craven's 'Scream' that started the whole revival of the horror genre and re-invented the teen horror. Through no fault of its own, but rather a succession of bland rip-offs, not to mention a very successful spoof (Scary Movie), Scream's original impact has been severely dulled. Were Scream released today it would no doubt be moderately successful but would be instantly forgettable. But back in 1996 the teen horror market was wide open. The teenagers of the 90s were bored of traditional horror movies featuring haunted houses, vampires or deformed monsters. They had seen them all. So Wes Craven, having reinvigorated the horror genre once before with 'Nightmare on Elm Street', set out to do it again. This time, along with Kevin Williamson, who would go on to be creator of Dawson's Creek, created a new kind of horror  one that you could laugh at as well as scream at.What made Scream so successful is that it was never patronising, and displayed a strong sense of ironic self-awareness. It took every horror cliché in the book and turned them upside down. For the kids that had seen too many movies, there was now a movie for them. The characters did not follow the clichés, but in fact talked about them, and talked about what would happen if they were in a movie. This sense of irony may seem tired now, but when Scream came out it was new and exciting. There was rarely a need to scream 'don't go upstairs' or suchlike in Scream, because the characters themselves were saying that! The idea of the killer being amongst the students adds a fresh dimension to the film, as fear gives way to paranoia at not being able to trust anyone. The subversions of the accepted horror clichés, in particular in the opening ten minutes (I'm not going to give anything away for those who have not seen it) also contribute to making Scream a truly shocking movie. It was this sense of innovation that made Scream such a breath of fresh air for the horror genre, and it is only a shame that Craven's genius has been ripped off so many times that his work has dated far too quickly. Craven and Williamson have also created a new horror star  but it was not a particular character but just a costume with an iconic mask. The Scream mask has become just as symbolic, perhaps even more so, than that of Michael Myers or Jason Vorhees.For any serious horror movie fans, Scream is essential viewing, if only to witness the film that started it all. The 'movie within a movie' idea was terrific, and would be taken even further in the sequel. The frequent references to classic horror movies, and reversals of accepted horror clichés, especially in the opening ten minutes) are also fun to watch out for. There is even a wonderful moment where one boy climbs in the bedroom window of his girlfriend  a scene that would be taken and used as one of the foundation for Williamson's successful teen series Dawson's Creek.The iconic mask, the one-liners, and the unique self-awareness when it comes to horror clichés make Scream a true original  accept no imitations.",8,81,91,27 February 2006
Bruce Almighty," Comedic but Christian!
","After experimenting with more serious roles and flirting with critical acclaim in films such as 'The Truman Show' and 'Man On The Moon', Jim Carrey made a (relatively) toned-down return to comedy with this 2003 smash, showing flashes of the comic brilliance that made 'The Mask' and 'Ace Ventura' such massive hits. Bruce Almighty is at once a simple but also potentially tricky premise; a downtrodden journalist (Carrey) complains one too many times about God's role in his life, and is thus imbued with all the powers of the Creator – along with all the hitherto unconsidered responsibility that goes with it. What follows is a film along the well-trodden typical rom-com path; jokes, puns and sight gags for the first half, before giving way to more serious stuff. As a result, partly due to the weighty subject matter, Bruce Almighty gets somewhat bogged down at the halfway point by questions of morality and philosophy as well as the usual relationship issues, which causes the film to drag and sit heavy before returning to the path to the ending.So, what would it be like to be God? Serious question! Fortunately, thanks to Carrey's presence, there are some genuine laugh-out-loud moments (in between typical gags of sledgehammer subtlety), as the lead is given the opportunity to wisecrack, gurn and impress as only Jim Carrey can, while still pulling off the hangdog everyman he perfected as Stanley Ipkiss. There is enough zing in Carrey's performance to remind viewers of his similarity to a young Robin Williams – fortunately minus the Chewbacca-esque body hair! Meanwhile, even in comedy, Morgan Freeman still exudes the same air of confidence, trustworthiness and gravitas that typifies all his roles, thus adding credibility to possibly the most impossible role of all: God. Yet, after his convincing turn as the President of the USA (Deep Impact) several years previously, it seemed like a logical career progression. And would you really want anyone else as the Alpha and Omega? As it turns out, Freeman is given little do but play straight man to Carrey's funny man, yet he still manages to steal the film from right under the lead's nose, all the while occasionally espousing pseudo-moral message. Plus, he wears a sharp suit so slick he makes Humphrey Bogart's Rick look downright shabby! As always, Jennifer Aniston isn't taxed in her role, playing her usual variation on 'Rachel from Friends' - sweet, lovable and attractive but with little more depth than a kiddies' paddling pool! But then, why would they? It's Carrey's show.However, where the film seriously starts to falter is when the 'com' portion of the film takes a back seat to allow the 'rom' portion to take the wheel. In a typical rom-com this would be predictable but acceptably sappy, but with the added questions of personal responsibility and morality – something not new to Carrey films (Liar Liar). Add that to the film's skirting around the edges of religious questions such as the existence and power of God, and no wonder the film is used in R.E. lessons up and down the country! But, if you can forgive the occasional holier-than-thou message which sometimes veers into outright preaching, what you have is a classic Carrey comedy that can be easily enjoyed.Just try to see it as a film, not a sermon!",8,0,0,15 March 2012
Speed," High-paced, highly charged action
","For sheer adrenaline, there's not a lot of films out there to top Speed. If released now this film might possibly be considered politically incorrect and sensitive (but then again, what isn't?) but its just a simple terrorism movie (although the 'terrorist' wants money, so probably not technically a terrorist).The main portion of the plot revolves around a bus which is armed with a bomb that will blow if the bus drops below 50 mph. Keanu Reeves is the cop on the bus, with Sandra Bullock driving the bus through the streets of LA at breakneck speed. Dennis Hopper plays the bad guy with a mix of wise-ass and psycho, to create a very effective villain, and Jeff Daniels is Keanu's partner on the ground (as it were).It sounds simple enough, but the simple idea is surprisingly effective, making for some genuine breath-holding, edge-of-your-seat moments. As with all Hollywood movies, you just know that a romance plot line is going to creep in somewhere, and Speed is no exception. But even though the romance is telegraphed from the moment Reeves gets on the bus, it doesn't detract too much from the story.It's not a particularly clever film, but it really doesn't need to be. Just sit back (if you can, if not just sit on the edge of your seat) and enjoy the ride.The worst thing about this film is, as successful as it was, it was always going to spawn a sequel, and spawn is definitely the right word. Speed 2: Cruise Control is an abomination which sullies this one. So do yourself a favour, watch this, but instead of watching the sequel, just watch this one again.",9,1,2,9 May 2005
Final Destination," A new twist on the slasher flick!
","Final Destination is your average run-of-the-mill teen horror movie, but with one key difference from most; a rather unique premise.Having had a premonition that the flight he is boarding will blow up, Alex (Devon Sawa) causes panic by telling the plane, forcing the airline to disembark him and several other people. When the plane really does blow up soon after take-off, the FBI become convinced he caused the explosion. But they aren't the only ones on the survivors' tail. Death is also after them, and is determined to claim the souls that cheated it on the plane, and one by one they begin to die in bizarre and increasingly bloody accidents.The film is simply far too ridiculous for words. But that is part of the fun  trying to figure out exactly what series of morbid co-incidences will lead to a gruesome death., and who will be next. But to compensate for this originality, the characters are all straight out of school clichés 101; the jock, the kook, the nerd, the princess  they might as well have cast the kids from The Breakfast Club! But what is interesting about the casting is some playing against type  most notably Seann William Scott as a nerd and Ali Larter considerably dressed down as the kook, while Kerr Smith enjoys a change of pace from his role as gay Jack as the jerk jock. The acting is all steady but never spectacular, except for a brief cameo by Tony Todd of Candyman fame who manages to steal the film from just a couple of minutes screen-time as a creepy morgue worker.Certainly more original than any of the other major teen horror flick franchises doing the rounds such as Jeepers Creepers, and definitely worth a watch. But perhaps two sequels (including the forthcoming Final Destination 3) was perhaps stretching a good idea so far.",7,0,1,2 February 2006
The Matrix," Yes, it really is as good as you remember
","With all the imitations, spoofs, parodies, rip-offs and sequels that have come from it, it is easy to forget just how groundbreaking 1999's revolutionary film The Matrix really is. Yet even 15 years later, it still has the power to amaze and shock as much as it did on the day of release - power not wielded by many since, and certainly not the two cash-inspired sequels.Back in 1999, the Matrix was a genuine original - something rarely seen in the movies in the latter decades of the twentieth century. It was a film that took such an interesting concept that it seems amazing that it hadn't been done before, and coupled it with genuinely mind-blowing special effects to produce something very special indeed.The story itself is almost so simple it's genius. The film's premise rests on the idea that the entire world is an elaborate construct of machines, and that we are unaware that the entire population of the earth is simply plugged into a virtual reality which feeds the sentient machines which now rule the earth. Those few who have escaped are now able to re-enter this 'Matrix' at will, and bend its rules of gravity and physics as one would bend the rules of a computer program. This leads to spectacular shootouts, furiously fast fight scenes, jumping and dodging that would put an Olympic triple jumper to shame, and all of which featuring the now much-parodied slo-mo camera spinning that became synonymous with the film itself, and which made it stand head and shoulders (and knees and toes) above the rest.It seems odd to think that Keanu Reeves was not the first choice to play the lead role of Neo. Usually being able to display only a single emotion might be a drawback, but in the sepia-tinted dulled colours of the grimy world of The Matrix, Reeves' constant single expression of permanently mildly perturbed seems a perfect fit somehow, and the thought of Will Smith's excessive personality in the lead role (as was apparently the first choice) seems like a completely incongruous thought now. Meanwhile Lawrence Fishburne's presence as a 'Morgan Freeman-in-training' mentor with muscles role is perfect, while Hugo Weaving's minimal yet menacingly effective turn as the villainous Agent Smith nearly steals the show from the effects gurus' noses. His understated delivery is at times positively chilling - in particular his addressing of Reeves' Neo as 'Mr Anderson' in a manner ice-cool yet dripping with malevolent intent. Interestingly now, this role seems perfect preparation for him for his role in a second monumental trilogy of films, as shades of his performance as Agent Smith are apparent in his similarly brilliant role as Elrond in the similarly blockbusting Lord of the Rings. It's just a shame that other roles aren't similarly fleshed out - particularly Joe Pantoliano's potentially fascinating role of 'Cypher' - leaving the central quartet as the only real roles with significant screen time. Additionally, Carrie-Anne Moss lacks the warmth and charm to be a convincing (and inevitable) love interest.Yet these are only relatively minor quibbles. Which brings us on to the special effects themselves - which are, quite simply, the most visually impressive since Terminator 2's T1000 morphing, if not ever. A number of standout shots have made their way into popular culture - including the camera-spinning freeze-in-midair kick which forms the standout part of the opening scene. Having been imitated so much in numerous subsequent comedies and spoofs such as Scary Movie and Shrek, their impact has perhaps been diluted over time, but to go back and see the shots in their original context still will transport an audience to a state of wonder that only the cinema can bring.The Matrix is a film that is always well worth a revisit - whether it has been a few weeks or a few years since you have last seen them. It's just unfortunate that it raised the bar so high that few films were able to subsequently raise their game enough to match it - including two average, serviceable but pale-in-comparison sequels that inevitably thought that more equals better. But as a stand-alone film, The Matrix is one that will stand the test of time, and will no doubt come to define the era in the way that classics such as Casablanca, Gone With The Wind and The Godfather have defined theirs.A true masterpiece.",10,0,1,23 March 2013
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Still a timeless classic!
","It's dated, it's clunky, and unbelievably corny. Yet somehow it works, and it is magic.A new review of the original Star Wars film is now warranted in the wake of the completion of the saga with Revenge of the Sith.Surely everyone is familiar with the Star Wars story, so I won't insult anyone's intelligence by summarising it. But the simplicity of its classic-style tale is one of the things that makes it so magical; a real good vs evil or David and Goliath tale for Science Fiction, complete with space battles, and possibly the first film of its kind.The acting is incredibly hammy, in particular from Mark Hammill and Harrison Ford, but that somehow makes it more charming. Alec Guinness however is absolutely superb, displaying the skills which made him one of England's finest, and best-loved actors to have ever graced the silver screen. Never tempted to overact, he carries the role with grace, dignity and gravitas - the embodiment of all the qualities come to be associated with the Jedi. Peter Cushing plays a terrific chief bad guy, just the right side of over-the-top, but of course the real star is Darth Vader. Menacing in both appearance and voice, he is the ultimate film baddie.Side by side it is amazing to see the obvious effort Lucas has put in to tying the films together, and at the same time the original seems unbelievably dated and anachronistic next to the shiny new films. But obviously that is no fault of Lucas' (at the time the special effects were positively groundbreaking) and the elbow grease has certainly been applied to scrubbing up the film. The added sequences also make a great deal of difference.Also, in light of the final installment of the Star Wars saga, events of the original become more informed, such as R2-D2's motives on Tatooine, and Darth Vader's character suddenly becomes much more layered.But underneath all the polish and new digital effects lies a classic story that is still one of the most popular of all time. It's a rousing adventure with good old-fashioned space-battles, endless quotable dialogue and possibly the most memorable film villain in cinema history.The film has a somehow indefinable magic that is missing from both the new films, and modern cinema in general. Maybe because it is the original, maybe because it relied on models, sets, and great storytelling rather than CGI, special effects and blue-screen filming. Either way, it still has the capacity for adrenaline-fueled excitement and thrills even on its twentieth viewing, something which certainly sets it apart from the majority of films. One of a rare few films which can justifiably be called a timeless classic, and that has a genuine claim to the never-ending debate of the greatest film ever.If you haven't seen it, then it is essential you do simply to see what all the fuss is about. And if you have already seen it, you don't need me telling you how good it is to want to see it again. Just go watch it again!",10,1,2,1 November 2005
Fantastic Four," finally a film that puts the fun back into comic films
","After a succession of dark and/or self-important comic book adaptations, such as batman, sin city, spiderman and the like, fantastic four makes a very refreshing change. It is very bright, lots of colour, and a fun, light-hearted tone, with a plethora of puns and gags which will have you giggling and groaning at the same time.It also makes a refreshing change to see them (eventually) embracing their powers as gifts, and using them and not being shy about remaining anonymous, as most other superheroes will do. This perhaps makes the four seem more human - the public know exactly who they really are. Anyway, this also gives a touch of grounding in realism  guys that looked like that, with powers like that  we'd know all about them surely? It's not like a pair of glasses each would make them Joe (or Josephine) regular, a la Clark Kent (how did Lois buy that for so many years anyway?) But I digress. Ioan Gruffudd manages a competent if rather textbook American accent, and Jessica Alba fulfils her assigned role by being as hot as ever (though why are female scientists always knockouts? They never were in my school!). The stars of the piece though are Michael Chiklis' heartfelt portrayal of the thing, and Julian McMahon camping it up superbly as the villain. Chris Evans (no, not that one!) rounds out the heroic quartet as the arrogant guy who takes full advantage of his fame, cut straight from the template.The special effects are superb (although that comes almost as standard nowadays), and all of our heroes get chance to fully show off their powers, even if some of them have been amplified from the original comics.One criticism of the film is that although running at 1 hour 45 minutes the story was too short in itself, and that most of the film seemed to be all about setting up a series of sequels - as if this was merely the first chapter of the full film. Be that as it may, as a franchise launcher, it has certainly whetted the appetite. A sequel will be eagerly anticipated, and will be expected to improve on its predecessor.",8,0,2,27 July 2005
Sin City," Innovative, original, gripping, unique
","Too many films are described as unique or groundbreaking in some way. However when it comes to Sin City, those platitudes are well and truly deserved.Sin City is a vile corrupt cesspit of a town, where no one is innocent, even the good guys are bad, and the bad guys are truly evil. The film is made up of three distinct original stories based on Miller's novels, all cleverly interwoven, and narrated by each story's main character. This adds to the real adult comic book feel to the film. Shot almost entirely in black and white, with sporadic splashes of colour, the film is beautiful to look at, managing to capture the essence and feel of a classic 50s noir while also looking modern, thanks to being shot almost entirely on green screen. The girls and the cars are absolutely beautiful, and the guys are always anti-heroes, vigilantes or downright sick or evil.The scenes are almost frame for frame recreations of the original graphic novel source material of Frank Miller, and the characters really look their comic-book equivalents. The dialogue is superbly written, with an almost poetic quality, and all in all is extremely faithful to Miller's original work. The three stories themselves are all uber-violent and gritty tales of revenge, honour and justice (although the sentiments often prove somewhat misguided or self-defeating), and no one is entirely innocent  with the exception of Nancy, played to angelic perfection by the beautiful Jessica Alba.A superb cast make up Sin City, where virtually every single face is a recognisable one. However, the undoubted star of the piece is Mickey Rourke, who is a revelation in his comeback performance as Marv. Somehow he manages to make a manic psychopath driven by a need for revenge seem like a hero, if only because the guys he is killing are even worse than he is. Elijah Wood too is superbly creepy as the mute cannibal Kevin, and it shows how hard he is working not to find himself typecast as a hobbit. Bruce Willis, Rosario Dawson, Benicio Del Toro and Clive Owen, amongst others, are all also excellent, making Sin City a truly brilliant all-round ensemble piece. However it is not for the squeamish or faint-hearted, as the claret (and limbs) flows freely and frequently.The only quibbles are that the superb instrumental guitar riff which appears on the film's trailers and menu does not appear on the film soundtrack itself, and that the sequel is not due until late 2007! A truly brilliant film, probably the best film of 2005, (a year which also saw the release of Batman Begins and Star Wars) and a gripping comic book tale of corruption and justice, filmed in a truly unique and innovative way. A work of art, and a film that must be seen by any true movie fan. Sin City is simply a cool movie.",10,3,6,28 February 2006
Gladiator," The Greatest Epic of the 21st Century
","If only Peter Jackson hadn't come along and done a rather good trilogy of films, we might possibly be talking about the greatest film of the 21st Century so far. Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.Russell Crowe gives quite simply the performance of a lifetime as the Gladiator Maximus, one that deservedly won him Best Actor at the 2000 Academy Awards (although his performance in the following year's Beautiful Mind was arguably even better, even if it didn't win him his second consecutive Oscar), and provided a thinking woman's alternative to the likes of Pitt, Cruise and Clooney to swoon over. His gravely voice and impressive physique combine to give him a huge presence, which literally fills the screen. His dialogue is sparing, but his actions speak far louder, adding a stoic sadness to his vengeance-driven heroic character. Before Gladiator, Crowe was a good secondary actor; after Gladiator he was catapulted to the top of Hollywood's A-list, and remains there, thanks to this career-making performance proving him to be one of the finest actors of his generation.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the scheming and corrupt Emperor Commodus who betrays Maximus and has his family killed. He manages to be delightfully and totally evil without ever descending into the realms of pantomime villain, which is a tricky line to walk, and manages to avoid being overshadowed by Crowe's monumental performance.The fight scenes are rousing and superbly choreographed, in particular a scene where Maximus marshals his fellow slaves into an army against marauding chariot archers in the Colosseum. The dialogue is kept simple and never overbearing (no need to worry why all of Europe speaks the same language) and culminates in one of the most memorable pieces of script that is destined to join the ranks of 'Play it Sam' and 'Are you talking' to me' as one of the most quoted (and misquoted) lines in movie history  although it is rather wordy. But here it is, in full; 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.' As Crowe turns to the Emperor in the arena and delivers this line, it proves to be one of the most electrifying moments in cinema history  hairs will stand up, spines will tingle, guaranteed.The action is set to some truly beautiful music, and it is shameful Hans Zimmer missed out on the Oscar for Best Score. Ridley Scott was similarly unlucky in the Director category.The film is however tinged with sadness, as it proved to be the final (but triumphant) swansong for the careers of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, both of whom died shortly after making this film. Neither could have delivered much finer performances, and if any performance had to be a final one, both delivered one worthy of such a status here. Reed in particular is a revelation, reminding older generations and showing a new generation of his considerable talent.An inspiring film, rousing, exhilarating, exciting and moving. Superbly acted, directed, scored and visualised. A tribute to how great films could be once, and could be again.",10,20,27,7 December 2005
The Island," Slightly different but still the same
","Michael Bay's latest offering of summer blockbuster action is 'The Island', a tale of clones being bred and used as insurance policies; they will be harvested if their 'sponsor' should need replacement organs. To ensure the clones are kept in tip-top condition, their lives are carefully managed and almost pre-programmed to believe that they will one day win the lottery and be chosen to go to paradise – the eponymous island. In fact all they 'win' is a trip to the operating theatre. When Lincoln Six-Echo (Ewan McGregor) and Jordan Two-Delta (Scarlett Johansson) discover the truth they escape and go on the run to start a new life, and find their 'sponsors'.The Island is most definitely, to paraphrase a popular cliché, a film of two halves. Michael Bay, in his first major picture without the guiding hand of Jerry Bruckheimer, appears to be suffering from an identity crisis. To combat this he attempts to develop his own new identity, and thus the first half of the film seems to be almost a theological essay on the ethics of cloning. However, Bay inevitably cannot rein in his natural instinct to blow things up, and thus the second half of the film the whole inconvenient ethics dilemma falls by the wayside as the police and special forces pursue the two escaped clones across the country in a variety of chase scenes.The main problem for 'The Island' is that it cannot make up its' mind what it wants to be. Does Michael Bay want to make a serious film to debate the issues of cloning or does he want to stick to what he knows best? As a result of this indecisiveness, the film flows like two halves clumsily meshed together.However, if you can just sit back and try to get past the rather radical change in gear (and almost direction) then there is some fun to be had in the second half of the film. Few people do chase sequences like Michael Bay, and his first outing without Bruckheimer shows that he has just as much talent as his former collaborator. The highway chase involving flying motorbikes and 18-wheelers is real adrenaline-fuelled excitement. There are also numerous fish out of water gags as Lincoln and Jordan emerge from their sheltered lives into the real world, and find everything completely unfathomable (although they do pick things up very quickly!).McGregor works hard here playing a dual role of clone Lincoln Six-Echo and his sponsor Tom Lincoln – the latter allowing him to use his natural Scottish accent. Johansson however does little more than play the textbook cute and smart blonde with no real depth to her character performance. Sean Bean, in another interesting change of pace, does not ham it up as the evil doctor, and instead gives a restrained, ambiguous performance – indicating that Bay is not prepared to comment too strongly on the ethics dilemma portrayed here. Steve Buscemi however is totally miscast as Lincoln's friend who helps them escape – even playing a nice guy he comes across as creepy, with a slight weasel-like quality. But then, he does that so well that his attempt at a change is admirable. Ethan Phillips provides a semblance of 'comic relief' while Djimon Hounsou plays the standard muscle-for-hire from the textbook.Overall, as summer blockbusters go, this serves as reasonable entertainment – for the second hour at least. The first hour remains a light essay that doesn't want to get its hands dirty by digging too deep into the ethical dilemma of cloning. But perhaps this is just as well, as Bay's typical target audience don't want to think too much. It seems that he is caught between two directions – dumb down too much, or not quite dumbed down enough. But if you can disengage the brain, 'The Island' will prove reasonably diverting for a couple of hours, but will be forgotten not long after.",7,0,0,2 February 2006
