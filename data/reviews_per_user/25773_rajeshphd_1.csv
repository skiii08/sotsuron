Skyfall," worst Daniel as bond
","i saw this movie two weeks before. i was expecting continuation of casino Royal and quantum of solace.there was no connection to previous one, what happened to the previous one. truth is it didn't even look like bond movie. the beginning was good then the movie is completely lost actually it became ordinary villain try to revenge the boss who made his life terrible and the hero (bond?) tried to stop and fails. the worst seen is the bond crying, so touching what is he aim for the Oscar.i think they made this film just to introduce new M, money-penny and the scientist guy, i don,t recommend any one to see this movie. if you want waste your time and money go and see it.",1,18,36,28 November 2012
