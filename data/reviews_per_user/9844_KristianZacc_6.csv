War Dogs," The B-Grade Wolf of Wall Street
","Minor/Vague SpoilersBased on a true story and directed by the guy most well known for the Hangover trilogy so how well this movie goes was up in the air for me as I did enjoy two out of the three even if only one of them was truly great. The story is basically two guys, Miles Teller and Jonah Hill, who were friends in high school reconnect and Hill's character offers him a job with him selling guns to the army and Teller easily accepts because he's desperate for money especially since he has a kid on the way and of course, things don't go as they planned. Jonah Hill played his character perfectly. As soon as he comes on screen you know he's a jackass but he's one that is fun to watch on screen. He has great scenes and moments where Hill just goes all in and he becomes this nutjob of a character. It's kind of easy to see where the film will end up going with his character which I think is a bit of a problem with the movie. If this were a straight comedy than Miles Teller would be the straight guy with Jonah Hill as the idiot comic relief. Teller is amazing. In everything that I've seen him in (yes, including Fantastic 4) he has always been fantastic. In this film he has great chemistry with Hill and you believe that they did have this past relationship. His character just wants to be something more than just a simple masseuse doing anything he can to get his next pay check. Hill leads him to get in over his head which kicks off the premise of the movie. The two actors play extremely well off each other whether it's for comedic purposes or otherwise and it works! I was very impressed with the pairing and wouldn't oblige to seeing them together in another film in the future. Bradley Cooper is fine, and doesn't really add anything to the movie in terms of the character being played by Cooper and he could've been played by anyone else. To be honest, I completely forgot he was in the movie until he showed up halfway through. I'm always interested in these kinds of movies, the little guy making it big, basically The Wolf of Wall Street. That's how I would sum it up as just the B or even C grade Wolf of Wall Street. That really couldn't escape me at all throughout the movie and when they're doing crazy stuff all I was thinking was of Leonardo Di Caprio and, funnily enough, Jonah Hill. The film does have absurdness with it; you could get that from just reading the synopsis or watching the trailers. So, if that's not your kind of movie then it would probably be best to skip this one. The one that stood out to me was when they go through 'The Triangle of Death'. The craziness was what made this film fun to watch, just anticipating what crazy thing they would do next. The pacing of the movie could've been edited much better and there were some parts in the middle where I thought it dragged a little. So, I would understand if some people can feel the two hours of the movie.While the film has problems with the predictability in its character direction and how the three act structure will play out you can still get a tonne of enjoyment from this movie just by watching the couple's zany adventures.",7,1,1,20 September 2016
Sing Street," 80s Music Nostalgia Mixed With Original Music Equals An Amazing Film
","Minor/Vague Spoilers Originally, I was turned off watching this film because I had heard it was a musical and they don't really peak my interest. As time went on I kept hearing about Sing Street and how amazing it was so I decided to take the plunge and boy was I wrong!First off, I didn't see it as a musical in the traditional sense where everyone just randomly burst out into a choreographed song and dance (even though it happens once but it still isn't done totally in that way). It was more just watching the band aptly named 'Sing Street' perform their songs. It was closer to just being a coming of age movie with a great story filled with great performances. This movie, in a nutshell, set in Ireland about one kid starting out in a new school and everyone there is picking on him. He meets this girl and convinces her he is a part of a band (that doesn't exist yet) and they want her to be in their music video. Once she says yes he groups some other kids together and they start their band. Jack Reynor, plays the older brother and he is a standout. The film shows how brotherhood can impact ones life. This is even referenced in the films closing credits where it says, 'For brothers everywhere.' The film really pulls on the heartstrings through these two brothers and it is in the final sequence where we get a powerful moment from Reynor that really brings this sense of brotherhood together and brings a close to both the character's development. Aidan Gillen, plays the father mostly known for portraying Littlefinger on Game of Thrones. Even though for most audiences he would be the one cast member that they would know prior to this film he doesn't take up any unnecessary screen time that would take away from the overall film. The original music that was written for this film was fantastic, 'Riddle of the Model' and 'Drive it Like You Stole it' most likely being the big hits that would come from the film. 80s composer Gary Clark composed most of the music that is heard which I'm sure has already been released in a complete soundtrack. Adam Levine even has a song, 'Go On' that he co-wrote and performs during the final sequence. We hear hit songs that were actually released during the 80s (so it's a well of nostalgia) and it influences the kids, especially the main character Conor (played by Ferdio Walsh-Peelo in his acting debut) who is shown to be changing his hairstyle and the music he wants to play no matter if it's Hall & Oates or The Cure. It's definitely realistic in that way where everyone wants to follow their idols and take from some of their music. This film is grounded in realism and you feel for these kids. It wouldn't surprise me if some people were able to relate to these characters and be able to bring their own experiences, of trying to find out who you are and where you fit into this crazy world, into the viewing experience. Overall, this film was fantastic and director John Carney deserves all the praises as he was able to get amazing performances from these kids that couldn't be a more charming film if it tried. I really don't have anything to say about it, even the ending, which I could see if some people thought was a bit too out there or possibly went against the films 'realism'. You get everything you want out of a movie from this film and more!!",10,1,2,21 September 2016
Don't Breathe," Surprise Hit of 2016!
","Don't BreatheMinor/Vague SpoilersLast year it was The Gift, this year it's Don't Breathe. A Film that has come, seemingly, out of nowhere in the thriller/horror category and to me at least completely taken by surprise by how excellently both were done.The director, Fede Alvarez, is very impressive with some of the shot compositions that he comes up with. While I wasn't a fan of his Evil Dead remake a few years ago he returns with a big hit. When the movie turned and Stephen Lang's character switches from innocent looking blind man to bad ass blind man the tone was set for the rest of the run time. 90% of this movie takes place in his house and you feel everything from isolation to fear to sometimes even catching yourself holding your breath as the kids do while Stephen Lang walks around the house hunting them down. When the kids first enter the house there is a great tracking shot that lasts quite a few minutes and never seems to cut away and it was very effective in showing the layout of the house as the kids walked inside it. The film has mostly an unknown cast barring Stephen Lang who plays a blind man who owns the house that the three kids are trying to rob. He is very intimidating and because of his little dialogue it is all about his physical performance and he brings that in spades. Seeing him charge around the house as he goes after the kids with a weapon. There are some other subtle moments where you see him feeling his way around his house and tapping the ceiling, or swinging a small fan to get his bearings on his house and instantly know where he is.I felt that most, if not all, of the characters choices made were realistic. As they made their decisions I would quickly think to myself if that would be the right choice and this made the film be more believable even in this odd situation. Adding to this is also the lack of false jump scares where the direction of the camera or the music is leading up to a scare and then a cat jumps out of nowhere or a hand on a shoulder. They were all real scares and this is a huge plus for me as false jump scares always frustrate me and just come off as a cheap and unnecessary. Thankfully, this film takes the opposite approach and there are, obviously, a lot of silence which creates tension and adds to the tone that I was talking about before. The way the first twist was delivered felt very convenient in the way it was delivered to the audience but I don't know how else they could've done it. The big twist felt very 'icky' and really grossed me out but that doesn't mean it was a bad thing, actually, I think it succeeded in what Alvarez was trying to do. Even if it took away from the simple premise of the movie I still think it added to Lang's character as you find out his motivations for some of the things he does. The movie keeps on going as well and builds upon the previous scene. Just when you thought the movie was coming to its end another moment happens and that happens a few times. Thankfully, it doesn't feel dragged out but instead just made it more suspenseful. In the end, Don't Breathe was a refreshing take on the horror film genre which wouldn't surprise me if it was in my top 10 of the year, as was The Gift. It flipped the home invasion trope on its head and the tension is always turned up to a ten. As a huge horror fan I really hope this film is successful so it can lead the horror genre outside of the conventional box it is in now.",9,2,6,20 September 2016
Sicario," Extremely well made crime thriller by Villeneuve
","Minor/Vague SpoilersSicario is an American crime thriller directed by Denis Villeneuve about an idealistic FBI agent, Kate Macer, played by Emily Blunt, who is enlisted by a government official to help a joint task force to take down a Mexican drug cartel. I was intrigued by the premise and after the buzz it was getting from the 2015 Cannes Film Festival I was excited to see this after it was finally released in Australia.When I was aware that Villeneuve was the director of this film I was excited just from looking at his track record, his previous two films 'Prisoner' and 'Enemy' both being top 10 movies of their respective year, for me.The cinematography in this film is amazing and effectively shows you the scope and brings you into the world that Villeneuve is trying to portray. Some of the shots would stay still for a few moments and I was on the edge of my seat even when close to nothing was happening I still felt like something might any second. The colours, yellow and orange, are very prominent which gives you the feel of the landscape being in a desert area.The performances across the board were as close to perfect as you could get. The main protagonist Kate, is who we see the film through their eyes, so to speak, and when she first arrives and is being driven through Mexico we see the world and how shocking it is and we feel the same way she does. Emily Blunt is amazing, playing another heroine after her role in Edge of Tomorrow, she brings a lot of different sides to her character, both having just enough vulnerability and strength to make her relatable as a main character that the audience can root for. Josh Brolin, in my opinion, had his best performance since No Country for Old Men, playing Matt Graver, one of the people who recruit Kate. Alejandro, portrayed by Benicio Del Toro, is the star of this movie. Even though his character has a lot of blank stares and seems to remain extremely calm throughout the entire movie, his true emotions may be suppressed because of something that happened before the film. The three main stars mix well together and no one stands out for the wrong reasons.Even some of the smaller side characters Victor Garber, Jon Bernthal, and Jeffrey Donovan bring something to the film and have great performances. Villeneuve certainly brings out the best in these smaller characters that certainly have an impact on the three main characters that create a nice through line throughout the movie.Tonally, this is a very dark film and there isn't very many light moments, almost ever, even when it may look like there could be, it switches and goes straight back to the dark world we have become so used to. You are set up from the opening scene to know what kind of movie this will be. Maybe it speaks to some twisted person deep within me but I really enjoyed this aspect and how they never let up because that just made it seem even more real. Some of my favourite moments were when there were these tense, suspenseful moments that had no music behind them to try and enhance those scenes because it wasn't needed at all. These made me more invested in the film and made me highly anticipate what was going to happen next.When the movie ended I was in awe and absolutely loved what I had just seen. Everything was strung together to create an almost perfect film and I really hope this gets a nomination because it definitely deserves it and I'm really looking forward to the next movie Villeneuve directs.",9,2,6,2 October 2015
Sausage Party," Seth Rogen Brings The Raunch
","Minor/Vague SpoilersSausage (but really Hot Dog) Party is a satirical, non-family friendly, animated comedy film directed by Greg Tiernan, his feature film debut. It was really interesting to note that Tiernan has swung in the completely opposite direction from his previous works on Thomas & Friends where he introduced CGI into the series. Tiernan and his wife founded Nitrogen Studios Canada, Inc. in 2003, and he used his studio for pre and post-production in this film. Lead star and writer, Seth Rogen, has been working on this film for eight years and has said that studios were scared to pick it up because of its R rating. Eventually Sony Pictures and Annapurna Pictures would partner and co-finance the film and fast forward to August 2016 and here it is. First thing's first, if you are not a fan of Seth Rogen's comedy then this might not be the movie for you. This is very low brow and way over the top and considering he called all his buddies (James Franco, Jonah Hill, Michael Cera, Danny McBride) for roles in the movie his style of comedy shines bright like the entrance to The Great Beyond. On a basic level the film could be described as Toy Story with food, the same way The Secret Life of Pets could be described as Toy Story with pets. It clearly is going off past Disney/Pixar films that use this concept and posing the question, 'what if our food had feelings?' From the trailers I had thought there would be more involved with being at the woman's house and trying to escape The Great Beyond and get back to Shopwell's, the films supermarket where all the food resides. The Great Beyond is the world outside the supermarket and that is what the food items perceive to be a Heaven and the real life people are Gods. What really took me by surprise, in a good way, was how the film used satire and social commentary to talk about real things such as religion, politics, and war all portrayed by stereotypical food items from their respective countries. While, there were moments that showed it was self-aware (specifically one scene involving cheese) and smart, it did not shy away from being EXTREMELY raunchy. One of the final scenes was especially raunchy and while I was shocked to be watching what I was, I couldn't help myself but laugh my ass off. The scene just kept going and going but didn't get old, it just built upon itself and made it more hilarious. The film also has many different elements to it (Horror, meta, raunchy) such as the scene where the food items find out that The Great Beyond isn't what they thought it would be and it turns into a horror comedy. Even though most of the scene is shown in the trailers it still plays out quite well, just not as hilarious as if I hadn't watched the trailers 10 times over. There is a bit of a lull in the middle where they take the time to do some world building inside the shopping centre where each aisle is like another country. The jokes do come to a halt here but I see it as necessary for the film because it enables us to get introduced to a whole world instead of just the hot dog and a bun. The ending to this film could open it up to a sequel if they choose to make one (heres hoping they do)! It gets very meta and for a moment I thought the movie wasn't over but instead the credits hit and Sausage Party Two is left as just a twinkle in our eyes. Hopefully, it doesn't take another eight years to get it into theatres.",8,7,15,31 August 2016
The Martian," A return to form for Ridley Scott?
","Minor/Vague SpoilersEver since Sir Ridley Scott broke through with his feature film debut, Alien (1979) he has been a force in the film industry with other major successes in Blade Runner (1982), Thelma & Louise (1991), and Black Hawk Down (2001) just to name a few. Most people, myself included, would say that he has been in a bit of a slump with a few of his previous movies including, Prometheus (2012), The Counselor (2013), and Exodus: Gods & Kings (2014). So, because of that I was really hoping that his latest film, The Martian, would be a return to form for Ridley Scott. The advertising for this movie was everywhere; anytime I went to the cinemas a trailer for this film would play which was preceded by Matt Damon introducing it. When I saw the trailers the first thought that came to my head was that it could be 'Cast Away on Mars' mixed with Apollo 13. There was also a tiny bit of similarities to Interstellar 2 for obvious reasons when looking at Matt Damon's character as well as Jessica Chastain also starring in the film. While the small parallels were there, they disappeared quickly once I got over that novelty.The film, which is based on Andy Weir's novel, The Martian, is about astronaut Mark Watney (Matt Damon) who is mistakenly presumed dead and left behind on Mars after a storm, who then has to try and fight to survive and signal Earth to come and rescue him. This movie brings a lot of comedic moments that I wasn't really expecting just based on the premise of the film. It was very well done, mostly by Damon and even Donald Glover in a smaller role. Damon's character is very much an optimist when the situation would probably call for anything but that emotion. Damon takes what the writers of the film created and plays the character extremely well and had me laughing much more than I thought. All of the supporting cast, Kristen Wiig, Jeff Daniels, Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sean Bean, Sebastian Stan, and Chiwetel Ejiofor really make, what could have otherwise been just pointless secondary characters, necessary and they add to the overall story that make the stakes even higher because of how well they all play to the situation that is presented in the film. Halfway through this film I came to the conclusion that the trailer didn't give away as much as I thought when going into this movie as I was a little afraid that I might have already seen half of what the story had to tell. The way the film is shot could only be described as beautiful and breathtaking. It really captures the landscape and there are no flaws that I could see in anything that we saw on Mars. Scott made what could have been just a simple, desolate landscape come to life. This also adds to the fact that it could be somewhat believable that this may have been a real story, even though it isn't. Something that my friend said to me as we were walking out of the theatre was that there wasn't a real bad guy that a traditional Hollywood movie would have. I really didn't notice this as I was watching and couldn't have agreed with him more once I thought back on the story. This makes the film much more impressive because it didn't have to rely on the use one of the biggest Hollywood tropes and make it extremely suspenseful and enjoyable.The only problem that I had with the film was that sometimes when they were explaining the science behind what they were about to implement they did it a few too many times. They had the people on Earth explain and discuss how they would pick Watney up on their way past Mars and then it would immediately switch over to Watney and he would once again explain the scene we just saw. Overall, this was a very strong return to form for Ridley Scott where everything, acting, writing, and cinematography comes together and is wrapped up in a neat little package that is meant for the big screen.",8,3,6,20 October 2015
