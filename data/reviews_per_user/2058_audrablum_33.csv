The King's Speech," Great story about overcoming fear
","This week I watched The King's Speech (2010). The logline reads 'The story of King George VI of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, his impromptu ascension to the throne and the speech therapist who helped the unsure monarch become worthy of it.' The film was a great look into fear and how crippling it can be. As a last resort to speech therapy, King George VI visits with Lionel Logue. Logue's unusual methods lead to an unlikely bond between the two and helps King George VI to better understand himself and attempt to overcome the things that cripple him. A great cast is only the beginning of the film's great qualities. The story is wonderful and both the shot composition and the editing techniques work to support the story. The film was director by Tom Hooper who is known for pieces that address the human condition. This film was no different. The costuming, sets, and props all transported the audience back in time to live a little in the 1930s. The camera work was fantastic and really helped to bring the audience into the film. I am glad I watched this and I would highly recommend it.",10,0,0,29 June 2018
Meet the Parents," Funny
","This week I watched Meet The Parents (2000). The logline reads 'Male nurse Greg Focker meets his girlfriend's parents before proposing, but her suspicious father is every date's worst nightmare.' The main characters are Greg, our antagonist, his girlfriend Pam and her father Jack. Greg's main goal in this film is to win the approval of his girlfriend's father and then ask his her to marry him. What stands in Greg's way is Jack's automatic disapproval of him and a continuous strand of bad luck that hijacks his every move. Although Greg tries his best to keep a level head this back luck is only further instigated by Jack's disapproval. Although the movie is a comedy and I thought it fit into its genre quite well - it is not a movie that I found particularly 'moving' mostly because I don't enjoy this style of movie. However, I did enjoy watching it and will likely continue to watch it's sequels.",9,0,0,1 December 2017
Se7en," Enjoyable but may be too dark for some
","This week I watched the crime drama mystery called Se7en (1995). This was a very interesting film that revolved around the detectives who were on a serial killer case. The setup of the characters was probably the biggest initial draw into the story. The incoming young and raging rookie, played by Brad Pitt, is an excellent foil to the outgoing calloused detective, played by Morgan Freeman. The movie's aesthetic really contributed to the experience of the movie. The shots were very cinematic and the lighting lended itself well to the color grading. Albeit a gritty film the shots had a very high artistic value. This seemed to play up some irony in the film, almost a beauty through chaos kind of effect. The story was also very engaging and I thought that it was (mostly) enjoyable. The first three fourths of this film I liked. Then it started crossing some dark boundaries, which I don't think are great areas for filmmakers to go. There were several murders against women, which appeared to promote a sort of violence against women. Yes, it's a story, but it seemed to be a little too grotesque and dark for some viewers to be okay with. There are ways to tell a similar story without making it so vile. The end of the film also took things a little further than necessary. If you like feeling like dirt when you end a movie experience, then you may enjoy this sort of film. I will not watch it again, nor will I recommend it.",6,0,1,14 October 2018
Fight Club," It earned its place in history
","This week I watched Fight Club (1999). It wasn't what I expected at all. The film really was artistic and definitely felt like a 90s film. I will admit that I did not see the plot twist coming. I do think the film was good, but I wouldn't say it was my cup of tea per se (but I think I knew that going into it). I really liked the way that the characters were set up and how the main character met Marla Singer. The film was definitely engaging. I can't say that I necessarily felt anything watching the film other than the occasional disgust when the characters would do something gross or the occasional weird feeling when the story went somewhere strange. The editing is probably one of the best things about the film and I feel that it may have triggered its own editing genre that seems to have what I call the pause and whiplash effect. The narrator will be speaking, the visuals pause as he explains, then the visual is unpaused and takes the viewer through a whiplash sequence of shots before returning to a normal pacing. The perspective of this film was told from the main character, who also served as the film's narrator. I'm not sure that there was a point to the film other than crazy people can lead an army. I think that it was more about telling an interesting story than serving much of a deeper meaning. The payoff for this film comes toward the end when we realize who is really in control and when the main character achieves his goals, even if they were oddly screwed up goals. All in all I'm glad to have finally seen this movie and can see why it has taken its place in film history's hall of fame.",9,0,0,4 May 2018
Creed," Great example of a successful adaptation to a franchise
","This week I watched Creed. The logline reads 'The former World Heavyweight Champion Rocky Balboa serves as a trainer and mentor to Adonis Johnson, the son of his late friend and former rival Apollo Creed.' The movie had an engaging plot line that dealt with real life matters. As an aspiring writer I feel that the humanity that was pulled into the story remained true to the Rocky franchise. This heart-warming story turns what could have been a proponent of evil into a proponent of rising above. I feel what separates this film from others of its kind is it's ironic message of life amongst a sport of destruction. I personally don't think that I would have done anything differently to this film. Having been produced by two of Hollywood's Major Minor's, the technical aspects of the production did not disappoint. Aside from the writing, the editing also really stood out in this film. The pacing was really good and the story was really allowed to breathe. All in all, I was glad that I finally watched this movie and would definitely watch it again.",9,1,1,18 January 2019
Dead Poets Society," Brilliantly Ironic Poetic Film
","This week I chose to watch a dramedy called Dead Poets Society (1989). The logline reads 'English teacher John Keating inspires his students to look at poetry with a different perspective of authentic knowledge and feelings.' The movie made me feel inspired as an artist. At its core the story embraces Shakespeare's line 'to thine own self be true.' In this story John Keating, the new English teacher exercises unconventional methods to help the students grasps their individual senses of artistic freedom and the importance of not being governed by others rather embracing one's own identity and desires. Through a series of ups and downs the students have to come to terms with the depths of what that means. The story made me think about how important it is for people to be accepting of one another, especially for parents to accept their children no matter how different they are. The movie also reminded me that each person just might define success differently. A parent may see success in career and financial status whereas a son may see success as penniless but enjoying his or her career. 
 I think the story writing here was brilliant. The ideas were strongly conveyed through the dialogue script and even paid tribute to its poetic theme by using such things as irony, foil, and foreshadowing techniques. The acting was great too. Obviously Robin Williams stole the show, but he younger men were quite talented. The directing was great and mostly felt seamless. The pacing seemed a little slow to me at some points, and some of the cave scenes reminded me of The Breakfast Club (1985). The movie was made by Touchstone Pictures so of course it was professional quality. I liked the use of lighting and there were definite moments of contrast where the lighting was used to highlight the inner 'dark thoughts' in certain moments. Overall, I loved the film and wish I would have seen it sooner.",10,0,1,17 February 2018
Ed Wood," Under appreciated movie, unnoticed film history
","This week I watched the bio-dramedy Ed Wood (1994). In this film, Johnny Depp portrays a botanist gone director. Through a wild and crazy series of ups and downs, hard work and luck, Ed learns the movie business. This was nothing like previous Tim Burton movies as the movie was comedic and biographical. I really enjoyed seeing Johnny Depp in this role. I felt like his acting really had the opportunity to shine in a new way. The story was entertaining and engaging. I went into the film not knowing much about it and was saddened to learn that this was based on the real life story of director Ed Wood posthumously named 'worst director in the world.' I felt like this was a very low blow on Hollywood's part. No one, in my opinion, deserves that title and it is especially low to assign that title to someone after they have departed this world. This movie was a professional work and as such it had very high production values. I thought that Martin Landau played a stellar Bela Lugosi and Vincent D'Onofrio was a convincing Orson Welles. I thought the casting was exceptional as most of the stars looked like the parts they were playing and in D'Onofrio's case even sounded as convincing. I really liked the black and white touch that this movie was given. It really pulled the viewer back into an earlier era of the movie business and the editing and shot style imitated films from those days. As the movie came to a close I found myself wanting more movies of Ed's life. I wanted a part two. All in all, I enjoyed this movie and would definitely watch this again.",10,1,1,30 September 2018
Deadpool 2," A close second to the first
","This week I chose to watch Deadpool 2. The logline reads 'Foul-mouthed mutant mercenary Wade Wilson (AKA. Deadpool), brings together a team of fellow mutant rogues to protect a young boy with supernatural abilities from the brutal, time-traveling cyborg, Cable.' 
 To be honest, the beginning of the movie was emotionally confusing. Deadpool is supposed to be funny but it started off pretty dark, even for Deadpool's standards. As the movie went on it got a little more funny and I did think the story was enjoyable. It had all of the dark and grotesque humor of the first film (maybe turned up a notch or two). I was pleased with the ending and am wondering if Deadpool 3 is in the works? 
 The story had a lot of action sequences and some interesting CGI, but it didn't feel overdone. The dialogue was classic Wade Wilson mucking up the jokes and of course I laughed. The editing was appropriate for the movie, in fact it was done extremely well and made me regret my life not becoming an editor because the editing was so pretty. The thing I did actually catch myself thinking in the theatre was that this film knows how to breathe. Many films nowadays are made so haphazardly that the directors try to shove too much in to the movies and don't allow the audience to feel anything before transitioning to the next shot. Deadpool did a fantastic job at allowing the audience to process and synthesize the information before cutting to a new shot. I found it pretty ironic that the rogue movie of the Marvel studios was the one who got this the most right. The story was pretty great too. I will be the first to admit that I liked the first one better, but this was a pretty good second and good for Wade to really be tested as a character. I think that worked out well. 
 All in all, I liked this film a lot and hope to own them at some point. Even though the movie started out on an emotionally confusing note, it found a way to come back to it's classic content. Watching the movie I could tell that Marvel gave Ryan Reynolds and his crew a lot more leeway on this film since the first one was so successful. The cinematics were fantastic and the film held a lot of good film classic production values. I feel that many films can learn from this one and I look forward to watching it again.",10,1,3,8 June 2018
Sleepy Hollow," Out of the box, interesting, and enjoyable
","This week I watched Tim Burton's fantasy-horror-mystery Sleepy Hollow (1999). The logline reads 'Ichabod Crane is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the decapitations of three people, with the culprit being the legendary apparition, The Headless Horseman.' I found the film when I googled 'not too scary movies to watch on Halloween.' I can safely say this fit the bill of being creepy enough to be a good Halloween flick, but not so creepy that I didn't enjoy it. I really enjoyed the way that the genres of fantasy, horror, and mystery. I felt that the film was engaging and interesting without being over the top gore or too scary. This combination also gave the film a uniqueness that isn't shared over other horror genre or mystery films and I feel that it worked well for the story. The script is based on the book 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' and it seemed like a good representation of the story and a natural choice for a Tim Burton film. The script could have endured a little further revision to kind of polish it and eliminate any unnecessary dialogue. Most of the actors were enchanting choices for their roles and pulled off wonderful performances, all except for Christina Ricci. Both her acting and her voice were extremely flat in this film and I was left feeling really put off by her as a casting choice in this film. The only sense I could make of her as the choice for this role is her slight visual resemblance to Helena Bonham Carter. Other than that the role felt wasted on her. Naturally, being a Tim Burton film all of the elements of production were there. The audio and dialogue was clear and professional grade. The color correction was beautiful and consistent. The look of the film was just hauntingly gorgeous. All in all, I was glad to have finally seen this film, even if I was a little late to the game. I have to say that I think it may be a new Halloween favorite for me.",9,1,2,3 November 2018
Full Metal Jacket," Why is this considered a classic?
","This week I watched Full Metal Jacket (1987). Let me just start out by saying that I was not the biggest fan of this film and I am surprised that this is such an occult classic. I thought the storyline was kind of weird and directionless. I felt like I kept waiting for a climax that never came. I didn't care for the content of the film and I see why my ex was so obsessed with it. It seemed geared for someone like him -- not me. Being a military brat I get that this film is supposed to represent 'how it really is' in the military, and I do think the film gave an accurate depiction in that regard. Who knows? Maybe that's why I didn't care to watch it. Most of the scenes I felt were drawn out for too long and Kubrick took advantage of the shoot up scenes to get a little extra gorey, which I also didn't care for. Some of the music seemed out of place -- and not in a good creative way, but in a weird I don't get it way. Traditional to Kubrick films the cinematography was an artistic manifestation of the internal turmoil of the scenes. The editing seemed to shift throughout the movie, which I also didn't care for stylistically. For most of the movie the editing was traditional cinematic, and about Â¾ into the movie, the editing suddenly becomes 'TV news style.' Some people might be into that, but I thought it felt out of place, abrupt, and strange. Perhaps that was Kubrick's intent to make the viewer feel strange because he wanted us to feel that war is strange. I think that the film translated Kubrick's vision well. I believe that the point of the film is an anti-war message. I see a lot of undertones for this in the script. The film's plot seemed to be 'real-life' war from the perspective a a journalist/soldier. And as for payoff? As I mentioned earlier about the editing, the pacing changed a few times in the film and was strange. There wasn't really a good payoff to this film in my opinion, but I think that's what Kubrick was going for.",3,1,3,15 March 2018
Fargo," Interesting Coen brothers' film. Based on a true story. Well worth the watch.
","This week I watched the crime-drama-thriller Fargo (1996). The logline reads 'Jerry Lundegaard's inept crime falls apart due to his and his henchmen's bungling and the persistent police work of the quite pregnant Marge Gunderson.' Having spent most of my life in the west or the south, this film's Minnesotan culture was quite the experience. It was engaging to see the warmth and hospitable nature of people who live in such a frigid environment. I couldn't get past how this film was based on a true story. The chain of events was just insane and things spiraled out of control quickly. The one thing I wish has been done differently in this film is the end. Usually with 'based on true event' films, there is some sort of message letting the audience know exactly what happened to the characters in the film, but for whatever reason, we didn't get this closure. However, I will note that the writing in these sorts of films always amazes me. The research process must take months or years and yet we get to see the story formed with so many details. Being a Coen brothers' film it is definitely a worthwhile film. I think that the thing that stood out the most for me in this movie was the cinematography. Roger Deakins really did a good job incorporating classic cinematic styles into the modern day ambience in the scenes. One shot that stood out in particular is when the two baddy's were pulled over by a police officer and Carl's (referred to as the 'funny-looking guy') eyes are highlighted. It is easy to watch this scene and dismiss the light as a natural gobo effect, however, this is a classic cinematic style highlighting the dramatic effect of realization more commonly drawn from the noir style of film. These details are what separates the amatures from the seasoned professionals. The acting was also really well done in this film, but Frances McDormand steals the show as Marge Gunderson. I was surprised at how interesting this film was and how little I knew about it before today. I would definitely recommend it and will likely be watching it again.",9,2,3,10 February 2019
Aliens," Great story, great director, great experience
","This week I watched Aliens (1986) directed by James Cameron. The movie contained many of Cameron's directorial fingerprints and I saw some choices that carried over into his later film Titanic (1997). I thought the film was very well done. The script was really well written with a definitive story arc, good pacing, and every part of the script further drove the movie forward. I admire Cameron's sense of humanity that he injects into the film. Ripley was a strong female lead who was graceful, but knew how to take care of herself. In this regard, Cameron is one of the more in touch directors who includes positive and likeable female roles in his stories. The story was duly action driven and character motivated, which is really what kept the movie so interesting. I think that many action directors forget that half of the value of the film is the character. Action and special effects are only part of the equation and I think that Cameron proves this in Aliens. There were intense moments, but half of the fear was driven by whether or not the characters were actually going to live through the next moment, because we cared about the characters. This setup made for a great journey and a healthy payoff in the end. This was probably one of the most intense action-adventure-sci-fi films I have ever experienced and I love that it was an older movie. We should learn from those that have gone before us and not dismiss older films. There is value in what the greats knew and how they created these masterpieces and modern filmmakers should take note.",10,1,3,20 October 2018
Dallas Buyers Club," Need More of These Kind of Movies
","Oh. My. Gosh. Where do I start? All I have to say is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G! Why did I not know about this sooner? I went into the movie thinking 'Okay, another Oscar-winning movie to mark off the seen-it list,' but came out with a dropped jaw! This movie closely resonates with me as I was born with a retrovirus that gave me all kinds of health problems, and the doctors didn't know what it was (thank goodness). My liver started shutting down 7 years ago and I ended up seeing a nutritionist who was able to kill the virus with St. John's Wort. This experience opened my eyes to the 'business' side of the medical industry and props to Hollywood for calling it out!",Null,2,2,29 September 2017
Inside Out," Fun Film
","This week I watch the animated comedy adventure Inside Out (2015). Although this film suffers some interesting glaring loopholes, it is a wonderful example of externalizing intangibles. The concept of externalizing intangibles is simply a way of saying that certain non-physical elements are given physical manifestations. In this case, 11-year-old Riley's emotions adopt humanistic characterizations. The logline reads 'After young Riley is uprooted from her Midwest life and moved to San Francisco, her emotions - Joy, Fear, Anger, Disgust and Sadness - conflict on how best to navigate a new city, house, and school.' From a writer's perspective, I have a hard time getting past the idea that if Joy experiences any other emotion than Joy that would indicate that she also has a range of emotions and if so why do we never catch a glimpse of her internal controls? And if that's the case, then is this internal control system an infinite loop? Where does it stop? Once I push these questions to the side, I can appreciate the film for what it was intended to be on a more one-dimensional level. The concept of this film really is a wonderful idea and made for a fun children's story. Being a Pixar film, of course all of the production values are relatively standard for a major studio. I can only imagine how many rounds of edits and reviews were done by multiple artists and directors before the final cut was pushed through. The casting and acting were really well done and I'm not sure we would have had the same film had other actors been chosen for these roles. Overall, I enjoyed the film and would watch it again.",9,0,0,2 March 2019
Liar Liar," A classic for a reason
","This week I watched the comedy-fantasy Liar, Liar (1997) starring Jim Carrey. The logline reads 'A fast-track lawyer can't lie for 24 hours due to his son's birthday wish after he disappoints his son for the last time.' The plot of this film is rooted in an inexplicable fantastic idea that, for an inexplicable reason, this one child's wish is granted for his birthday. Once you can adopt the plausibility of this logical fallacy, the rest of the film is an adorable concept. Watching through this film I can't imagine anyone else in the role of Fletcher Reede other than Jim Carrey. His over the top nature and larger personality definitely brought the role to life. I also enjoyed seeing Cary Elwes in the role of Jerry. Elwes is a fantastic actor and I feel like this role gave him something unique to work with. Other than the actor's performances, the writing in this film really brought out the humanitarian message of the importance of parental involvement in a child's life. To be fair Justin Cooper also translated the role of Max Reede into a character that the audience could deeply care about. In my opinion, I feel that this film really encapsulated what good chemistry between a writer, director, and actor can do. Had we seen other actors in this film, I truly believe we would have been looking at a different film. Overall, I enjoyed this film and would recommend it to a friend.",8,0,0,18 April 2019
Lawrence of Arabia," Should be seen at least once
","This week I watched the adventure-bio-drama Lawrence of Arabia (1962). The logline reads 'The story of T.E. Lawrence, the English officer who successfully united and led the diverse, often warring, Arab tribes during World War I in order to fight the Turks.' I would have to say that the part of this movie I find the most interesting is that it is based on a true story. I always find these kinds of movies to be the most intriguing. I think that this provides a very powerful takeaway regarding the power of will and belief. Most of the movie was very professionally made. It was shot in a Cinemascope aspect ratio and 4-track to 6-track sound mixing, there were also some surprisingly rudimentary facets of productions. For example, many of the night time scenes were pulled off in some manner of early day-for-night technique via film-processing-technique. The special effects, particularly, the blood didn't seem to be professionally colored. The blood was too bright red and in some scenes not very believable. Despite the oddities in production, the casting was brilliant. Comparing O'Toole to the original photo of T.E. Lawrence if brilliant. There is much to be said about good casting decisions here. Conversely, being a different era, the dialogue was a little hard to follow in some parts. So much so that I had to turn on closed captions to really understand what was being said. I do wish that both the plot and the character were a little clearer. To be honest, I had a hard time following the action of the story or why Lawrence would make the decisions that he did or behave in certain ways. Sometimes it got a little muddy. I think this film is also a good example of how there are examples of white supremacy within old Hollywood. In this film it is somewhat glaring, but this can be really eye-opening too. Also, as is the nature of old-time films, the scenes dragged on for excessive amounts of time. Due to the length of this film, I can't say that I'd watch it again, but I do recommend it for educational purposes.",8,2,3,17 March 2019
Rise of the Planet of the Apes," Great lesson in storytelling conventions
","This week I watched the action-drama-sci-fi Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011). The logline reads 'A substance designed to help the brain repair itself gives advanced intelligence to a chimpanzee who leads an ape uprising.' This movie is a really good lesson in storytelling elements. It is also a healthy model of proper intercutting as well as shot composition and show don't tell. I enjoyed watching how the story unfolded and how much could be picked up without dialogue. I also found it interesting how quickly our standards of CGI can change. In 2011 the CGI in this film was state-of-the-art. Watching it now I noticed how primitive the CGI came across. The storytelling followed conventional method flawlessly. I did, however, pick up on one major loophole and that was that the scientists never ran pregnancy tests on their female chimps prior to experimentation, thus, Cesar was a complete surprise. However, this loophole kind of made the story, so we have to accept it. And of course, we can't write a review on this movie and not give props to Andy Serkis, who really made the character of Cesar what it was. Without him, we would not have nearly the element of humanity that really drove Cesar's character. This is the second time I have seen this movie and I have to say that I definitely enjoyed it more the second time around.",9,0,0,21 April 2019
Across the Universe," I was expecting a better movie
","This week I chose to watch the drama, fantasy, musical called Across the Universe (2007). I have wanted to see it since it first released and always put it on the back burner until now. It definitely was not the movie I was expecting and quite frankly I was a little disappointed. The story was somewhat hard to get into and if it wasn't for Joe Anderson's character, Max, the thing may have never left the ground. There was a lot going on, but no real direction for any of it. Things just kind of happened to the characters and we got to follow them along their song and dance, directionless adventure right up to the end. I could see also where the writers pulled heavy influence from Baz Luhrmann's Moulin Rouge (2001) and while I'm usually all for directors influencing other directors, this started to feel a little copycat minus any real point to the story. There also wasn't a lot of time spent on the character's development so it was hard to get behind why I should care for them really or why they were any more interesting than people I didn't already know. On a more interesting note, the story is set in the 1960s so it was neat to ride along with the characters in a time not so long ago and imagining what it would have been like to not own a television set, or be able to walk up to most people on the street without fear or reservation. In some ways the movie didn't feel that much different from modern times. The story, being that there wasn't one really, was pretty bland and ho-hum. Many of the musical sequences felt oddly placed and did not flow naturally, so it just ended up making the whole thing feel weird. On top of everything there were a lot of strange, unexplained visuals like Uncle Sam popping off a poster in a cartoon CGI kind of way. I understand the argument 'for art,' but this felt more like a 'getting high and writing scripts in the name of art' kind of thing. There was also a very strange scene where the group happens upon a circus in the middle of nowhere and the audience is expected to follow this mashup of strangely dressed characters making strange movements through what looks like an animated sequence but isn't. The acting was okay. The most enjoyable part was that most of the actors/actresses could sing (or so appeared to have via ADR). I feel like the two main components of this film that could have helped the film gain some audience engagement are the directing and the writing. Directing-wise it would be nice to feel a little more fluidity in the story. The story also lacked in nuance, which made it pretty flat-except the strawberries, the strawberries meant something. Writing-wise it could have benefited from an actually direction, some stakes, and some kind of story arc. All in all, I didn't enjoy the film very much and I could live my whole life never seeing it again an be okay.",3,1,4,23 August 2018
Rudy," Good Football Movie. Good Morals
","This week I watched the biography-sport-drama Rudy (1993). The logline reads 'Rudy has always been told that he was too small to play college football. But he is determined to overcome the odds and fulfill his dream of playing for Notre Dame.'The film was highly inspirational and I enjoyed watching Rudy persist. What really set this film apart for me was the level at which Rudy had to persist. He literally had no one on his corner in the beginning and had to earn every ounce of support that he ended up with. I feel like this is an important film to watch purely because of how much Rudy had to persist to achieve his dream. Often times our heroes are shown as having to overcome and obstacle or two and then he or she acheives their goal. This isn't the case for Rudy. He continued to persist when many other should have had good sense to quit.
Overall, the movie was pretty seamless in its production values. Being based on a true story the process of development for this film seemed to be pretty extensive. However, I would like to take a moment to praise the writing team. Rudy liked a girl, but their relationship was not central nor important to the story. Instead the focus of the film was on Rudy's academic career goals and stayed on them without dragging romance into it. That's rare and I was appreciative.The cinematography was also very well done and came off as very subtle and natural. I thought the movie was really well done and I would watch this with a friend.",10,1,1,22 February 2019
Eyes Wide Shut," Just another piece of smut disguised as cinema
","This week I watched Eyes Wide Shut (1999). To be be frank it was nothing short of smut wrapped in the title of 'cinema.' Storytellers everywhere should be embarrassed that we continually get away with this. There was nothing interesting about this film and I'm surprised that Kubrick would ever had thought this was his 'finest work.' There was probably ten minutes of well written story and the rest was just smut scenes. Let's say we get away from the smut for a minute, the rest of the story was really stale, surface level, and pathetic. The characters were extremely immature and uninteresting and it felt like there were major loopholes in these characters. For example, the way that Alice speaks isn't at all how women speak to the people they are with. The only time words like hers exit a female's mouth is when a man is sharing his fears with her and claiming that's what she said to him in his dream/thoughts, etc. Not only is her dialogue clearly written by a man, but she seems to be suffering some sort of mental disorder, and the doctor, who is likely trained in medical matters, marries this mentally ill character anyways? I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but let's go ahead and chalk this film up to what it really is an unapologetic man-tasy (male fantasy). Now, this supposed doctor, who has had to master the art of psychological disciplines like maintaining focus on sleep he likely only got days ago, among the other mental toughness of a doctor, psychoanalytic training, etc, can't deal with something his mentally ill wife said to him, so he, being highly emotionally unstable for some reason, gives himself license to have an affair? Okay, let's just run with it. Now, every important female in the movie is a cookie cutter version of Kubrick's fantasies. Everyone of them has the same body-type, the same color hair, and similar facial features. If you wanted to continue arguing that somehow this smut is 'art' then you at least need to change up your 'artistic elements' or you're really just validating the case for sexual eroticism for the sake of pleasure. I would also be more sold on this being of 'artistic value' if somehow the playing field was equal, but, lo, it is not. T and A is available in just about every scene, but heaven forbid we see a man's dongle. It is merely ever suggested that a male character's manliness was ever exposed, whilst women had the privilege of exposing themselves fully. If you want to cry 'art' then you should have fully exposed both sexes, otherwise it just comes across as derogatory and chauvinistic. There is no substance to this film. If it wasn't an assignment I would have shut it off in the first ten minutes and never looked back.",1,3,9,6 October 2018
Beauty and the Beast," A Total Disn-aster
","Beauty and the Beast (2017) was a Disn-aster (Disney disaster). This live action remake of Beauty and The Beast (1991) felt nothing short of a Japanese live-action anime remake. The plot is pretty similar to the original, loosely based on the novel written by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (1756). Similar to the 1991 animated story, Belle and her father move to a town where they are considered outcasts by the locals. Belle's father heads out to an event, gets redirected to the Beast's lair and becomes his prisoner. Belle rescues her father by taking his place and for the next two hours we witness Stockholm syndrome. This film left me and many others Disneypointed (disappointed in Disney). This film made me think about how not to rush a story through production and consider the additional steps needed to insure a film could be pulled off well. There was in fact a team of screenwriters for this movie: Stephen Chbosky and Evan Spiliutopoulos. I feel that there strengths were that they made a film that got financed. I feel that there weaknesses were that there was not enough strength in the film to make it good enough to stand on its own. The script relied heavily on the fact that the audience saw the 1991 animated version and understood that this was just a re-telling of that story. The director was Bill Condon who previously directed the Twilight: Breaking Dawn film. His strengths in this film were that he could blend the visual effects with the real life film quite well. There was enough space in each composition to make room for the CGI components and nothing really felt visually contrived. His weakness was made apparent in casting and editing. Half of the cast was trained to 'sing' with no real talent and made up for in post via auto- tune, or just left in the movie (Gaston went flat when he rallied the villagers. It was hard to miss). The film was edited by Virginia Katz, who had previously worked with Condon in Twilight: Breaking Dawn and in other previous films. The editing that seemed to work well was the composition of shots in the 'Be Our Guest' scene. There was a lot of seamless movement in that scene and it was really quite impressive. The cinematographer for this movie was Tobias A. Shliessler, who worked with Condon previously on Dream Girls. To me the lighting on this film felt odd and misplaced at times, which made the castle feel like a fake set. I personally wish there was more contrast over the scenes like there was in the animated film. Overall, there is a lot that I would have done differently. I wouldn't have rushed production. As a director I would have utilized more close-ups and would have hung on the shots that mattered. I would have maybe written a little more in character back stories, without completely changing the characters. As a musically based piece, I would have cast actors who could sing and maybe carried similar mannerisms to the animated characters. I would have also cast actors who looked more like those characters and kept them true to their characters. I probably also would have played up the original film score to serve the film. This really had potential to be a better movie than it was and I am personally disappointed with the half- hearted effort put forth by one of the largest studios in the world.",2,2,8,12 October 2017
Pulp Fiction," Typical Tarantino (Not My Fancy)
","Pulp Fiction, which was released in 1994, is one of those movies that is said to be a staple movie for any aspiring movie maker to see. So naturally, I decided to watch it. This film is directed by none other than Quentin Tarantino. I can say with certainty that the script and shot style is a trademark of his films. The log line goes like this 'The lives of two mob hit men, a boxer, a gangster's wife, and a pair of diner bandits intertwine in four tales of violence and redemption.' Tarantino's films always leave me feeling rather disturbed. This was no exception. Tarantino follows a much different direction when it comes to directing that I would. His shot style is usually 'life like,' with minimal close up shots and lots and lots of long shots that hang with one choice of framing (usually cowboy to long shots). The content was very Tarantino-esque filled with cursing, drug-use, and disappointing life choices for most of the characters involved. It concerns me to some degree that Tarantino's films perpetuate both a negative view of and violence towards women. All the women in this film were anti- heroic and good only for sexual arousal or companionship. Not once did a woman positively contribute to the good of the plot line. She was typically being used or abused, and the men in the flick were allowed to justify their violence against these women. The dialogue was also pretty standard of Tarantino with lots of verbal assaults, threats, and shouting. I didn't find much to engage in in terms of cerebral availability. To wrap it up- I could have in fact gone my entire film career and not watched Pulp Fiction, as blasphemous as that may seem in the movie industry. Just my two cents.",1,7,15,18 September 2017
The Holiday," Classic Feel Good Chick Flick
","This week I chose to watch The Holiday (2006). The logline goes 'Two women troubled with guy-problems swap homes in each other's countries, where they each meet a local guy and fall in love.' This movie made me feel sympathetic towards the main characters as they went through their respective issues. It made me think about the state of the world when it comes to relationships. The editing was good and was pretty seamless. This marks the best editors. As I watched through this movie I found the sound design to be very intentional. There was a heavy play of dialogue and music, and most of the rest of the sound effects were subtle and seemed distant in comparison. This directing choice to keep the dialogue and music as the auditory objects of focus played well to a dialogue centric movie. However, I did find in certain parts that the absence of sound effects in favor of music felt a little strange in some parts, like when the girls were first exploring the homes. I would have liked to hear more sound effects through those parts. Otherwise I thought it was great.",10,1,1,10 November 2017
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Good story
","This week I watched the adventure-war-drama The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957). The logline reads 'After settling his differences with a Japanese P.O.W. camp commander, a British Colonel co-operates to oversee his men's construction of a railway bridge for their captors, while oblivious to a plan by the Allies to destroy it.' Although I thought this was an interesting story, I can see the heavy sense of American Nationalism that bled through due to the era it was created in. I think that one of the best technical aspects of this film had to be the sound design. Aside from the technical aspects, the acting was really spectacular. Naturally Alec Guinness really did his part in the lead role of Colonel Nicholson. However, I think that Sessue Hayakawa is severely overlooked. He did a standout job as Colonel Saito. The film did seem to drag on in parts, but I enjoyed it and would watch it again.",7,2,2,9 March 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A Masterful Original
","This movie was an interesting story that blended art and reality together in a weird, yet realistic way. Parts of the movie felt a little disconnected from the audience (i.e. Birdman's unrealistic powers), but for some reason that disconnection left us feeling like we craved a deeper connection. And even though we couldn't relate to a superhero, we could relate to his very real life and the events in it. The movie takes its viewer on an emotional roller coaster as each scene further drives and intensifies the plot. I feel like there is a lot to learn from this movie and will definitely be re-watching it as I continually study the art of film.",10,1,3,8 October 2017
Blade Runner," 80s cult classic
","This week I watched Blade Runner (1982), The Final Cut. To my surprise and as a result of my limited time to research, I discovered that this was the only one of the seven versions that I could find available for streaming. Prior to this I had never seen this movie and had been curious as to what all the excitement was about. It was an interesting experience to sit down and watch this film understanding that it a product of the 80s. According to this film we will have wiped out most natural landscape and wildlife from the planet and will have advanced Android technology and flying cars by next November. Many of the ideas of 'the future' from Scott Ridley's 1980's mind was interesting to see and to try to dissect. Other than the 80s synth soundtrack the movie and questionable hair and outfit choices, this movie has a timeless visual. Having watched the Final Cut I would like to go back and see the Director's Cut and compare the differences. No matter which cut is viewed, it's iconic artistry and vision is something that every fan of cinema can enjoy. The art direction was ahead of its time and watching the movie and knowing it was produced in the 80s seems impressive. Of course reading up on the films history and the choices made during filming are interesting as well. All in all I would say that I enjoyed this film and am interested in seeing the other versions.",8,1,2,25 October 2018
The Greatest Showman," A brilliant, thrilling masterpiece.
","This week I chose to watch The Greatest Showman (2017). This film is uniquely a biography-drama-musical. The logline reads 'Celebrates the birth of show business, and tells of a visionary who rose from nothing to create a spectacle that became a worldwide sensation.' This movie made me feel inspired as a creative. The score was amazing and brilliantly paired to sensational visuals. The story made me stop and think about PT Barnum's life and what it was like. You see, I like movies that pay tribute to someone's life this way and how appropriate that it's the way we honor the father of show business in this style. I loved the poetry of the nature of the film being a musical and how it was a show that paid homage to showmanship. Yes, there IS controversy about the accuracy of the film, but the movie really wasn't meant to be a documentary. The entire essence of the films was just a relative artistic portrayal of a man's life that we might otherwise just take for granted. Looking at the real photos of the people this story was based on compared to the cast that played in the movie -- it is clear that this is simply a dolled up version of a real life tale. I think the story was pretty amazing and we got to learn a lot about who PT Barnum was and how the legendary circus came about. The acting of course was A-list actors and the actors were on par. I really enjoyed the cast that was assembled for this movie. I think that they not only worked their individual roles quite nicely, but they also played off of each other rather well. I really enjoyed that Hugh Jackman was cast in this role because I relived a tiny sliver of Les Miserables when he sang (I LOVE Les Miserables). The thing that I think I enjoyed the most about this film was it s directing. The director, Michael Gracey was formerly a visual effects artist and his intimacy with the visual shot composition makes itself apparent in the visual movements and editing transitions. This really gave the film a Baz Luhrmann stylization with added aesthetic excitement. Overall, I thought the film was wonderfully told and beautifully put together. I will be looking forward to owning this movie.",10,0,2,2 March 2018
Amélie," Beautiful movie, worth watching
","This week I chose to watch the comedy, romance Amelie (2001). The logline reads 'Amélie is an innocent and naive girl in Paris with her own sense of justice. She decides to help those around her and, along the way, discovers love.' There was a little more gratuitous nudity and sex scenes in the film than I cared for. I feel like most of these could be left out without missing anything in the movie. In spite of this, the movie was an exciting visual tale of a playful, yet extremely philosophical young woman named Amelie. Amelie spends a lot of time trying to help those around her and then scientifically trying to figure out how it all works together. In the process, she discovers something she can't figure-she can only feel. She finds love. Much of the writer seemed to make commentary about the world and how everything doesn't always amount to a black and white explanation, but instead there are so many grey areas that should be embraced for what they are and lived without being figured out. Much of the story of Amelie is about making human connection and that in the end love trumps all. The dialogue is all French with subtitles, so be prepared to read, but the story and writing are both good so it's not taxing. The acting was good, especially on Audrey Tautou's part. She really made this movie along with the artistic components. The art direction, editing, and directing are the trifecta that made this story twice as interesting. The cinematography and lighting were handled by Bruno Delbonnel who also worked on things like Across the Universe, Big Eyes, and Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince. Overall, the story was interesting, the visuals were amazing, and I would recommend this movie to a friend.",10,2,3,16 August 2018
The Matrix," The Matrix
","This week I went back to a classic and watched The Matrix (1999). The logline goes something like this 'A computer hacker learns from mysterious rebels about the true nature of his reality and his role in the war against its controllers.' This movie always gives me a rush and makes me feel interested in seeing how the plot develops. Watching this movie made me think about the intricacies of movie making, particularly as it pertains to sound. I really admire the editing in this film in both audio and video formats. There was clearly a lot of attention paid to this end. I think that the audio and sound editing in this film were particularly stunning. This film was equal parts video and audio treat for amateur and cinemaniacs alike. I a do not see or hear anything that I would have done differently for this film.",Null,0,0,16 November 2017
Apollo 13," Interesting film
","This week I watched the Adventure-History-Drama Apollo 13 (1995). The logline reads 'NASA must devise a strategy to return Apollo 13 to Earth safely after the spacecraft undergoes massive internal damage putting the lives of the three astronauts on board in jeopardy.' I personally liked how the movie was based on true events. I feel like what makes this movie different from other space movies is the fact that this movie is not science fiction based. I feel like another element that separated it from others like it is the classic touch of Hollywood heart that was apparent in the film. It was classic Hollywood goes to space, whereas the typical space film is more about 'science' or exploration, this film followed our heroes into space instead of epitomizing their journey. The writing for this piece is one of its most masterful elements. It takes a lot of skill to research a historical event and bring it to life. Directed by Ron Howard it beared his signature marks of creativity and professional artistry. The one attribute I did struggle with was it's striking similarity to Titanic (1997). Seeing as the score was also written by James Horner, I have to imagine what this film might sound like with a different composer at its helm. All in all, I found the movie to be interesting and enjoyable and I might watch it again.",9,0,1,30 January 2019
Incredibles 2," The sequel everyone deserves
","This week I chose to watch The Incredibles 2 (2018). The logline reads 'Bob Parr (Mr. Incredible) is left to care for Jack-Jack while Helen (Elastigirl) is out saving the world.' For 14 years the world waited for a sequel and the world got what it wanted. Pixar did a great job with setting up the trailer and giving the viewer enough information without revealing the plot twist. Absolutely nothing about the movie was a disappointment. The storyline was great and all of the action was well thought out. Nothing felt odd or out of place. All story elements were executed well and as per usual Pixar gave us dazzling visual effects. It is astounding to watch the beautiful elements come together in harmony to grace us with such delight. The story felt like classic Incredibles and stayed true to all of its elements. The characters also remained true to themselves. This is definitely a sequel that has earned its place as one that exceeds its prequel. All in all, I would have to say that this movie surpassed expectations. I believe that this is partly due to the fact that Pixar kept Brad Bird as writer and director. This does a lot for story continuity. This is a special movie and deserves it's box office smashing numbers.",10,3,8,16 June 2018
The Breakfast Club," It's not for everyone
","This week I watched the dramedy The Breakfast Club (1985). The last time I watched this movie I turned it off halfway through as I am not a huge fun of slice of life films. The movie is basically a dialogue, character driven format with the central action being focused on the characters' internalization and reflection. Watching this movie for the second time I was able to better appreciate this film from a cinematic perspective. I could appreciate the storytelling, character arcs, and the central messages behind it. The thing that I wish was done differently was casting. Watching this movie it was hard to buy that several of the characters were in fact high schoolers. I would have enjoyed this film a little more if the characters looked like they were actually in high school. The music choices and editing choices definitely stood out and I'm not sure I agree with those choices as they seemed rushed and eccentric. The directing and editing were professional and seamless and added value to the movie. The actors are probably what made the film any good. It was good to see the whole movie through, but I probably won't watch this again.",2,2,5,10 February 2019
Goodfellas," Understandbly a classic, misunderstandably miserable
","This week I watched Martin Scorcese's Goodfellas (1990). I like Scorcese as a director. That being said I didn't actually care for the movie at all. Sometimes I feel like directors cross lines that for the good of society shouldn't be crossed. This movie crossed those lines. I think it was a little more gorey than it could have been. However, the gore isn't my issue. My issue was the repeated violence against women. I get that the story is being told, but I think there are other ways the information could have been conveyed. I think that the violence against the women in this movie is crossing a line and somewhat revelatory and never punished giving male viewers a sense that this is acceptable behavior to some level. It is also celebrated that the protagonist violates his monogamous commitment and is again condoned for having multiple girlfriends. I know that this isn't a family friendly movie - I get that, but I think that there should have been some real recourse for his behaviors or some reason that the audience wouldn't cheer him on for doing this. Now that my opinions are out of the way I will look at this movie from an analytical perspective in regards to the point, perspective, plot, and payoff. The point of the film was to portray the true story of a man gone gangster in the 70s, to show his life and to tell his story. This movie did an excellent job of that. The characters were built well as was the storyline. The perspective of the film was actually a dual perspective. Most of the story was told from the perspective of a boy who volunteered to join the mob and grew up living as first an inductee and then a mobster. The next perspective was that of his wife Karen as she narrates small parts of her perspective throughout the film. The plot was (as somewhat mentioned earlier) about a boy gone mobster who deals with mob life and ends up making a crucial life or death decision in the end. The payoff was probably one of the better parts of the film which was a little too long in my opinion causing the payoff to feel abrupt and out of place. All in all I can see why the film is a classic -- it does a good job telling the story and telling it well and I'm glad to have seen it. That being said I hope I never watch it again.",5,0,3,29 March 2018
