First Man," A fantastic and astonishing epic journey!
","A thrilling and true movie. A must see.
The life of Neil Armstrong is really well described and telled, with the emphasis on his personality and relationship with his family which is quite rare in 'space' movies. Pictures are beautiful, and I have to insist on the use of reccurent first person shot or 'fpv view' which makes us feels in first hand what this astronaut must have lived in the moments we all still remember.
All the difficulties, the great and more often the bad moments.
Go watch it you will not be disappointed!",8,2,9,12 October 2018
