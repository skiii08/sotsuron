Changeling," A movie that may make you cry
","This movie had me in tears, as it is a true story, about sad events. You would never believe that such an incident could take place, but it did take place. The movie starts out with a missing child and continues on to be about the corruption of the police department, who caused the actions of a serial killer to go unnoticed! Don't think my last statement is such a great spoiler, as the movie reveals so very much more. It delivers such a great detail about these true events, that even if you knew the ending, you would enjoy watching it! (EXTREME SPOILER POINT!)A boy was forced to help a man capture & kill young boys. I could not help but feel compassion for the boy, as he did what he had to do to live. I was very dissatisfied that the boy was held accountable for his actions! Watch the movie and see if you feel the same way I did. A must see movie!!",10,3,4,27 September 2017
Billy Elliot," Outstanding entertainment!!!!
","Even if you do not care for the idea of a young boy's interest in dance, you might give this movie a chance.  If for no other reason, the soundtrack is fabulous, but the story is GREAT.  It may even even shed new light on stereotypes!  EVERYTHING in this movie is entertaining!!  I watched it 3 times in one week and my appreciation for it only increased!",10,0,0,22 April 2001
Hardball," Great re-make of 'Comeback Kid'
","I see many people refer to 'Bad News Bears', but that is well out of date concerning the real inspiration for this movie.  This is an obvious re-make of the 1990 movie 'The Comeback Kid'.  I had nothing but contempt for The Comeback Kid, as it left me high and dry, but this movie brought the true meaning and expression to life for me!     Do not be fooled into believing that this is a rap infested torture that has nothing you would regard as touching, because it is far from that! It is more than a monument to the original (C.B.K.), it is an instruction! The story is about a man, overwhelmed in debt (brought about by gambling) , given a chance to change his lifestyle by making a difference to a bunch of un-wanted city children.  You might not believe it when you begin watching this, but unless you are anti-sentiment, this movie will bring tears to your eyes (both of sorrow and joy)!COMEBACK KID vs HARDBALL:SPOILER!!!!    Although both of these movies had a tragic situation that brought about the positive outcome, Hardball won my acceptance because it explained the reason for the positive outcome!  Face it, in Comeback Kid, it was never made clear why the boy was inspired to join the team of boys, but Hardball makes it very clear!",7,0,1,24 March 2002
Room," Among one of the BEST movies I have ever seen!
","I put this movie right up there with ET, The Sixth Sense, Song Of The South, etc... A must see for anyone who enjoys well a well thought out story, excellent acting (especially that of child actor Jacob Tremblay). What a great acting job young Jacob did. What great, well thought out, extremely realistic acting! SPOILER POINT:There is a point in the movie when the boy says 'I hate you!' to his mother, and it is exactly the way a child would act in his/her situation! If you enjoy a great drama and suspense, then here is the movie for you! Sorry to all those who are looking for blood & guts... Not this movie! This movie does not need gore to impress anyone! A must see, believe me!",10,0,1,25 October 2017
August Rush," Great modern day re-make of 'Oliver Twist'!
","I loved this movie! It was like watching my own life as a boy and as I still am, with imagination and the integrity to stand up for what you believe in and not let anyone take you down!A boy is separated from his family believing that some one cares about him and there are people trying to track him down, both the good ones and the bad! About the movie: Very fun and entertaining! Mild, VERY mild! content that might offend some people, but based upon what I see in most movies these days if a movie could even be rated as 'G', this one should!Please remember that August says that he can hear the MUSIC which is every sound that he hears! (everything he can understand!!) This is important to get the meaning of this movie and get the best feeling out of the climax!!!!",8,6,12,24 November 2007
