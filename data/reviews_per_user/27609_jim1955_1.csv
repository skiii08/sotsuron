The Blair Witch Project," If you didn't know the story was made up, you'd be chilled
","I got to see an advance preview of this movie in Orlando, Florida.  This film is unique in that it's done entirely with Hi8 video tape and 16mm film. It will seem especially real to the younger (17-24) group, since the actors talk like this group talks.The idea of the movie is that you're watching recovered video of three kids who, for a school project, go into the forrests in Northeastern Maryland in search of the legendary 'Blair Witch'. This outing supposedly takes place in 1994, when the group heads out but is never heard from again.
Knowing that the story wasn't true, I wasn't too scared.  But my daughter, who didn't know that, well, she thought it was really scary (I told her when the film was over the story wasn't true).This film was done a a shoestring budget, but it works.  A lot of profanity (do young kids really use that much?) too.",7,1,2,20 July 1999
