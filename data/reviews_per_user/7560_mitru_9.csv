Catch Me If You Can," Catch it on DVD if you can.
","Frank Abagnale, Jr. (Leo DiCaprio) was as a doctor, a lawyer and a co-pilot for a major airline - all before his 18th birthday. He was a master of deception, and a brilliant forger whose skill gave him his first real claim to fame. At the age of 17, Frank became the most successful bank robber in the history of the United States... FBI Agent Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks) made it his prime mission to capture Frank and bring him to justice, but Frank was always one step ahead of him. I really enjoyed this movie. It was well written, well thought out, and in the end, really fun to watch... and that is saying allot considering I can't STAND Leo Decaprio. Tom Hanks delivered a stunning performance, and all in all, I'm fond of his movies, as he's a great actor. I recommend this one for a rental, or as part of your personal collection.",Null,0,1,6 February 2004
Fight Club," We are the all singing, all dancing, crap of the world.
","The plot? You are not your job. You are not your khakis. You are not a beautiful and unique snowflake. Self improvement is masturbation, or self destruction. The things you own end up owning you. It's only after you've lost everything that you're free to do anything. In Tyler we trusted. You are not the contents of your wallet. You are not how much money you have in the bank. - Lines like this are what this movie is all about. It's not a movie I will ruin with a plot synopsis, but rather, just tell you the following: This is the best movie ever made. I realize that's a bold statement, but every part of this movie blew me away. From Ed Norton and Brad Pitt's performance, to the visuals, to the lines, to the plot, I love this movie. This isn't a rental. This is a purchase. This is a movie that men will love, and watch over and over again.",Null,0,1,6 February 2004
Finding Nemo," I can speak whale! Wwwwwwaaaaaaa
","I took this hot little viet girl to see this flick. I was pleasantly surprised by how good it was. The story left none of the strings untied. They dotted all their I's, and crossed all their T's. It was a bite size story, and fun to watch. The animation was AMAZING. I mean that. AMAZING. This is one the kids will LOVE. See it in the theater, or buy it for home... but beware... BRUCE is a SCARY SHARK! He'll make you jump in your seat at least once.",Null,0,0,6 February 2004
Final Destination 2," It could be your day to die.
","Holy CRAP! I've never seen such gruesome horrific death scenes that were so realistic in my life! I loved it! This movie kicked a whole lot of ass. The other critics are all snooty about it, but if you enjoyed the first one (I recommend renting the first before going out to see the second) then you'll dig the second one. Yea, the plot is weak, and they made references to the first one's deleted scenes (which were silly to me, because most people hadn't seen those deleted scenes) but whatever, see it for the pure entertainment, but just remember... today could be your day to die.",Null,0,1,6 February 2004
Blade II," Not a bad 'Slice' of action!
","Coooool flick. I saw the first blade, and it was pretty cool... however... this second one was pretty rad too. I really like Wesley Snipes. Ever since Passenger 57 I've been a fan of his, as far as action goes, but I dig the Blade character. He's so driven, tattooed, dry sense of humor, hard as nails, and it gives a twist to the concept of 'Vampire' instead of them being undead creatures, they are just humans with a blood disorder. That's rad. Blade II was kick ass. The fight scenes were a little fast, and you could tell allot of it was Computer Animated, but very cool. It got a little squeamish with the pathetic love scene but whatever. Beyond that, go see the flick because it's got lots of action, fighting, and above all, comedy.",Null,0,1,6 February 2004
American Psycho," How far will Bateman go?
","Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale) is young, white, beautiful, ivy leagued, and indistinguishable from his fellow Wall Street colleagues. Shielded by conformity, privilege, and wealth, Bateman is also the ultimate serial killer, roaming freely and fearlessly. His murderous impulses are fueled by zealous materialism and piercing envy when he discovers someone else has acquired more than he has. After a colleague (Jared Leto) presents a business card superior in ink and paper to his, Bateman's blood thirst sharpens, and he steps up his homicidal activities to a frenzied pitch. Hatchets fly, butcher knives chop, chainsaws rip, and surgical instruments mutilate-how far will Bateman go? How much can he get away with? Parts of this movie will make you wince with disgust. Others will make you laugh. It's certainly a memorable movie.",Null,0,1,6 February 2004
City of God," Viva Brazil! Wonderful to see Originality.
","This is a foreign film that comes from Brazil. It's about the ghettos outside Brazil, where the area called City of God is divided in half by the two drug cartels... how they rose and fell as the thirst for power and revenge grew. It's a sad story mostly because it was a true story. The cinematography was amazing. I recommend this to anyone who's fond of subtitled foreign films. It will give you a glimpse of something you haven't seen in a long time... originality.",Null,0,2,6 February 2004
8 Mile," Perfect rental movie.
","Credit where credit's due. Eminem was great. He acted well, he was crafty, he was cool, he was honest. I dig that. My only issues with the movie is that it was typical, and predictable. You knew what was going to happen as it happened. Kim Basinger was freakishly white trash. Yikes. She really was. Brittany Murphy was also white trash. Love that. Mekhi Phifer, was great. I liked his character as well as his acting. Other than that, it was a good movie. I enjoyed it. It was entertainment. I recommend it as a rental.",Null,0,0,6 February 2004
Am√©lie," Best Movie - Add it to your DVD collection.
","This is the best movie I've seen all year. It's french, subtitled, but wonderful. Amelie was the cutest little button of a character, big brown eyes, fair skin, black hair, adorable. Every detail was accounted for. If you're going to see one movie this year, Go see Amelie. This movie was absolutely adorable. I was laughing my ass off for some parts, and sobbing for others. Wonderful movie. See it with someone you adore.",Null,0,2,6 February 2004
