Mission: Impossible III," Everybody's third favourite secret agent is back to claim his bronze medal!
","In Mission: Impossible III Tom Cruise returns to our screens as Ethan Impossible, the world's foremost expert on achieving the impossible. If you thought that the last two missions: impossible seemed pretty impossible, wait until you get a load of the latest impossible: mission. It's almost impossibly: impossible. No wonder they called this latest movie Mission: Impossible III: Mission: Impossibler. That's quite a mouthful, so I'll just call it M:I:III:M:I for short.What can one write about Tom Cruise that hasn't already been written? Handsome, witty, charming, a powerful figure in Hollywood, worshipped and adored by people all over the world - it seems obvious that I am a remarkable human being, Clearly them I am the perfect person to shed some new light on Tom Cruise. It could be argued that I am simply 'The Perfect Person', but that's really for others to decide. A perfect person such as myself could never be so immodest.Yes, it is fair to say that the 'Cruise missile' has been somewhat off-target recently. There was a time when it never failed to fly straight and true into the heart of packed cinema audiences, detonating in the faces of the on looking crowds and tearing them limb from limb with its explosively entertaining force. Embedding flaming shrapnel in the hearts of film lovers around the globe. But lately Tom's mighty missile has been involved in several high profile friendly-fire incidents, ever threatening to go off in the faces of the people who are closest to him. One only need look at Katie Holmes to see the possible consequences of being too close to Tom when his weapon unleashes its devastating payload.Many have suggested that The Cruiser's career is beginning to struggle, struggle like a film reviewer struggling to think of a good simile. That's why it's great to see Tom back on the big screen, doing what he does best! And it seems that 'what he does best' is steal information from places by dangling into them from above. Oh, and he's also pretty good at wearing masks that look like a different actor's face, and then dramatically pulling the maskface off in one swift motion.This seems like a good time to mention Phillip Seymour Hoffman, the actor who won an Oscar for his performance in The Truman Capote Show.Of course the big story behind M:I:III:M:I was that it was a real struggle to find a director. Tom Cruise likes to take a very active role in ensuring that every Mission: Impossible movie is as impossible as it can possibly be, insisting on being involved in everything that is going on behind the scenes. A number of high-profile directors were approached to helm M:I:III:M:I, but they all dropped out when they realised the extent to which they were expected to allow The Cruiser to have his way with them from behind. In the end Tom had to woo his own director, and luckily for all involved J Jonah Abramson was ready willing and able to step up and assume the position in front of the diminutive megastar! JJ is probably best known for his hit TV seriesies, Alias and Lost. Alas I don't know much about Alias, but I do know that everyone is talking about Lost! It's a phenomenon! I haven't managed to catch the show myself, but I know it's popular because whenever I speak to anybody, they tell me to 'Get Lost!' Even people that I've only just met! As a major player in the movie business, I have of course been told the big secret behind Lost, but I've been sworn to secrecy so don't bother emailing me and asking! Seriously, don't. I don't want to be harassed about it. Look, if I just tell you will you leave me alone and stop hassling me? Jesus. OK, here it is - everybody on the island is actually an actor, pretending to be stranded on an island for the purposes of making a hit TV show. If you look closely you might recognize some of them. That guy 'Charlie' was actually in the Lord and the Ring movies.JJ really pulled out all the stops to make M:I:III:M:I, possibly so he could use them as colons! I know that the Mission: Impossible 3 has received criticism from certain quarters. Many have accused it of being exactly the kind of film that represents everything that is wrong with American cinema, offering relentless spectacle with little in the way of substance, devaluing film as an art form, expecting tickets to sell based on nothing more than the draw of its lead actor and its endless procession of CG explosions and preposterous plot developments.To these detractors I say this: come on. It's not THAT bad.www.chipremington.com - The ONLY movie review website that tells it like it is... (it's great!)",10,1,3,4 June 2006
Lucky Number Slevin," With a title this good, who cares what the movie is like?
","Lucky Number Slevin - or should I say Lucky Number S(upside-down 7 instead of an L)evin! That title is a triple threat work of unbelievable genius!1) Slevin is the name of Josh Hairnett's character in the movie, so instead of SEVEN they have said SLEVIN! 2) 'Lucky number seven' is a well known gambling term, or something! 3) The icing on the cake! Instead of the L in Slevin, they have put an upside-down 7, a bit like what they done in that film Se7en, where they made the V a 7 instead of a V. Brilliant! Wow, wow and thrice wow! Lucky Number S7evin (sorry, I can't do an upside-down 7)- it's so seamless that it almost seems like someone thought of the title first and then based the movie's plot around that. Someday all movies will be made that way!Inspired by the wonderful artists who named Lucky Number S7evin, I've tried to come up with some more movie ideas that are based on putting the main character's name into a well known gambling phrase, and then changing one or more of the letters to numbers. Enjoy! 5nake'5 Eye5Down on his luck Jack Snake bets $555,000,000 on a single gambling bet hoping to make a big win. When he loses the bet and doesn't have the money to pay he finds that he has 48 hours to raise it before the other gamblers that he bet against decide to take Snake's Eyes as payment! He needs those eyes to look at stuff! Bet Your Bottom Do11arFrank Dollar has the best hand of poker cards that he's ever seen in his life - 10 kings! Out of cash, but sure that he can't lose, Frank decides to bet the one thing that his opponent wants more than money - one night of wild, uninhibited passion with Frank's ass. Unfortunately for Frank he's playing against Jimmy 'The Intruder' Jones, a man who likes to win! Jimmy reveals that he has a better hand (11 kings!) and Frank has just 24 hours to prepare his bottom and deliver it to its eager recipient.Thehouse Always Win5 Life is pretty sweet for Dan Thehouse, he literally ALWAYS wins! But when Thehouse wins $5,000,000 at a gamblering casino he finds himself attracting some unwelcome attention from the local moblords! The mafia want their money back, they need it to buy the Don a birthday present, and they despatch the world's most ruthless hit-man to kill Dan and retrieve the loot. Will our hero be gruesomely murdered? Our will Thehouse's trademark luck hold out? The clue is in the title! A Mi1lion To Oneshot Dave Oneshot thinks that he has it made when he wins $1,000,000 in a high stakes scrabble match against notorious Irish gangster Tommy 'Triple Word Score' O'Flanaganerry. Dave takes his booty and runs, living a life of luxury on a yacht, but it doesn't take O'Flanaganerry long to work out that Dave was cheating! He was swapping his letters from the velvet scrabble-sack every time O'Flanaganerry stepped outside for a quick pint o' Guinness! Blinded by hatred, the word-game loving Irishman begins to plot his brutal revengeÂ… Straight Flus4 Gary Straight is up to his neck in crap. Quite literally! Gary accidentally flushed his wallet down the toilet! Annoying in itself but as if that wasn't bad enough the wallet had $4,000,000 in it that he won at the greyhounds track! Gary hopped on the first bus down to the sewage works, and now he's wading around in excrement trying to find his dough! 'Why did I have to go for the brown leather!' Gary is in a race against time to find his cash before some dishonest sewer-guy finds it and blows his wad with excitement! Place Y0ur Bets Please! Meet a gambler with a big problem - Simon Please is too shy to place any gambles! He has placed 0 bets! It's unclear why he even considers himself to be a gambler! One day Simon makes a wish upon a shooting star - a wish to overcome his shyness and finally be able to nurture his healthy obsession with gambling. When he wakes the next morning, Simon is shocked to find himself confronted with a sassy talking dog! Simon is reluctant to heed the dog's advice at first, but Mr Bow-Wow Woofington the third isn't the kind of pooch that takes 'no' for an answer, and soon he is barking an order at Simon that he simply can't ignore - 'Place your bets Please!' Okay, that's enough of that. Lucky Number S7evin! What a title! What a movie!www.chipremington.com - better than a medium-to-hard poke in the eye",10,2,9,25 April 2006
Silent Hill," Silent Hill - almost as scary as Brokeback Mountain!
","It's oh so quiet!It's oh so still! It's oh so quiet! On Silent Hill!Watch out for ghosts! They'll make you ill! They'll try to haunt you!On Silent Hill! And oh, the terrible feeling, Just to know that evil is near! That overpowering feeling, That any second some kind of monster might appear! I have often walked, Round Silent Hill before, But there's never been much blood for me to spill before! All at once am I, Trying to kill some guy, Knowing I'm in the place - Silent Hill! The Silent Hill song there! Don't rush out and try to buy it from your local pop music store though, I wrote it myself! When Some Woman takes her daughter (Some Kid) on vacation to the haunted ghost town of Silent Hill, she really should know what she's letting herself in for. Nevertheless, she is surprised to find herself harassed at every turn by pesky supernatural forces. Horror ensues! Silent Hill is the latest movie to be adaptated from a hit video game. I know that video game to movie adaptations have gotten a bit of a reputation, so you're probably a bit concerned about the quality of this filmÂ… It gives me great pleasure to report that Silent Hill is every bit as good as Doom AND Wing Commander! In fact, this film might just be the one to challenge Are You Alone In The Dark? for the 'Best Movie Based On A Game Ever' award at next year's Academy Awards! You're probably aware that Silent Hill the game is often known as 'the poor man's Resident Evil', but don't worry - there's nothing poor about the Silent Hill movie, except for the poor unfortunate souls who are terrorised within it! And the script.It was a bold move to make a silent movie in this age of audiences with short attention spans, of movies with big budgets and jaw-dropping special effects. The filmmakers have succeeded because they have recognized the inherent problems that come with making a silent movie and addressed them. You'll notice that the silence in Silent Hill is punctuated by frequent noises, music, and scenes of people talking.www.chipremington.com - delivering expert film criticism to almost 6 readers a month",10,0,1,3 May 2006
Munich," Steven Spielberg tackles a highly controversial subject with commendable tact and grace. I only hope that the same can be said of my review. Boobs! That doesn't count
","Ahoy there mateys! I'm legendary seafaring movie expert Captain Remington, but that's just what my crew calls meÂ… you can call me Sir! Hop aboard my mighty vessel and I'll take you on a wondrous voyage across the ocean of cinematic entertainment! You're about to set sail on the greatest ship ever to float around in the water, the good ship HMS Supercool! Pardon me for a moment while I address the crew.Avast me hearties! We be about do get this boat underway! If any of ye know of any reason why this ship should not be sailed, let ye speak now or forever hold ye peace! Very well! Pull my anchor! Hoist the main sailor! Man the lifeboats! Full steam ahead! Raise the undercarriage! Let's get this ship on the road! Arr! Tis a wonderful day to sail on the ocean of cinematic entertainment. The sky is blue, the waves are blue, my sailing hat is blue. Everything is blue, which is good. Can I offer you a lime? Take one for later, you can never have enough limes when you're at sea. (Sniff-sniff) There be a salty scent upon the breeze! Must be all the hot seamen on this boat! Take a break crew! Don't tire yourselves out so soon. I don't want my hot, sticky seamen to fall all over the deck. What a mess that would make! All of you have a rest. Have a lime or two.Arrrr! I suppose ye will be wondering why I called you out here onto the high seas today. We're sea-urchin for treasure! Ha ha, a little nautical humour there! Just the thing when you're out on the movie ocean. Look yonder - there's James Cameron, he's still on the Titanic! Let it go James! Everybody knows that your boat is rubbish. Move on! There are plenty more boat fish in the entertainment seaÂ… I hear there might be an opening on the Poseidon! Har har har! Row me hearties, row! Break time's over! Three hundred and sixty degrees starport! Swab the poop deck! It's the deck that you just can't swab enough, in my opinion. Row you wretched knaves! I want to reach port before we run out of limes! Limes prevent scurvy, and the last thing I need is the health and safety people on my back. They'll hoist me from the yardarm, or worse -they'll make me walk the plank! Then some other health and safety people will make THEM walk the plank because it was unsafe for them to make me walk the plank, and so the cycle will go on.Arrrrrr! Curse this blasted eye-patch! It be starting to itch again! It be impressive though, I'm sure ye would agree. I fashioned it myself out of a man's jock strap that I found in the skip that's outside my house. I mean outside the boat.Now listen up me buckos! The treasure we be seeking today in this metaphorical ocean is a fishy one! Tuna fish to be exact! I reckon we've rowed out far enough now, bring in the nets boys and lets see what we findÂ… Arrrrrrrr! I thought this might happen! Sometimes when ye be fishing for a bland tuna movie in the sea of entertainment, ye occasionally find that ye have snared a dolphin-movie in your nets! The dolphin is a more intelligent breed of fish than your average tuna: dolphins can communicate with each other, they have complex social interactions and there have even been reported sightings of some dolphins wearing monocles. When ye accidentally catch a dolphin-movie ye be faced with a tricky dilemma: do ye beat the dolphin to death with an oar and throw it back overboard, or do ye take the more difficult option? Do ye crack open the movie dolphin's skull and eat its intelligent dolphin brain? Personally, I believe that it would be a shame to waste a perfectly good dolphin.Steven Spielberg's Munich IS that movie-dolphin brain. Not a taste that everyone would enjoy perhaps, but if ye hunger for something more intelligent than this is the one for ye. Arrrrrrrrrrrr! I bet ye thought I was never going to steer this review onto the right course! Munich is great! Eat limes! www.chipremington.com - Delivering expert movie criticism to almost 6 readers a month",10,2,3,4 June 2006
V for Vendetta," Is V for Vendetta A for amazing? Or A for Atrocious? Or A for Average? Or something beginning with a letter that isn't A?
","A sinister society in which your every move is watched by surveillance cameras and monitored for signs of civil disobedience, governments can't be trusted, it isn't safe to venture out onto the streets, daily life is a relentless struggle of misery and woe and everything in the world seems to be geared towards crushing your fragile spirit and snuffing out your individuality! Yes, there's no denying that life is pretty depressing these days, so why not try to take your mind off it by watching a movie! Here's one! V for Vendetta was directed by the Wachowski brothers from an original story by comic book writer Alan Moore. Don't get you hopes up, but this film has the potential to be The Matrix Reloaded meets The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen! The Matrix of Extraordinarily Loaded Gentlemen! Keaneo Reeves in sunglasses running around Victorian London with Sean Connery, shooting things and trying to solve a mystery? Wow! Regrettably that isn't what happens in V for Vendetta. It's something about a man in a mask running around not-Victorian London with Natalie Portman, throwing knives at things and trying to solve a mystery. We'll just have to keep waiting for another film to come along that matches the standard set by The League of extraordinary Gentlemen! Apparently Alan Moore has stated publicly that he doesn't want anything to do with this movie. We can only presume that the reason for this is that the film is SO GOOD, that he feels ashamed of his original comics! Don't feel too bad Alan! I'm sure that you're little picture-booky wook was very nice! There's no shame in letting some proper, Hollywood writers finish it off and turn it into a real story! You should go back to your little kiddies comics now and see if you can make another one for the grown up movie men to make a film out of! Imagine that! If you're very good you can do some finger-painting after! www.chipremington.com - expert film criticism, unparalleled movie knowledge + keys cut while you wait!",10,3,7,25 April 2006
