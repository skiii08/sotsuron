Requiem for a Dream," For God's sake get over it, take it off the top 250!
","ARRGGHHTHAPHSSDJKMPH. It's all I can say. I rate pictures by directors who think they can speak for people they clearly know nothing about much further down the scale than someone that might humbly try in earnest to tackle something more subtle and fail. Films like 'Crash', 'Fight Club', 'Traffic', 'Babel', 'Hotel Rwanda' all have that in common. I can see through the sleek, transparent surface right through to the disingenuous, morally righteous and self-espousing garbage at it's core. The film tells many stories, with one message: Drugs are bad. Stay away. Bad. All it does is serve as a reminder just how Harvard educated Darren Aronofsky is and how little he knows about the real world and / or drug abuse to craft this fantasy and pass it off as an educational lesson. The film is powdered donut disguised as art. It is a void. There is nothing. Nada at it's center. Just a man, the director, using cinema (the ultimate weapon) as a mouthpiece for a sheltered and one dimensional world view. Having rested on his laurels for years after making this film, grinning with pride at his achievement.. I wonder whether.. he ever.. thinks.. about.. what it is.. he... actually.. made... The characters are non existent, except as purely functional devices to propel Aronofsky's 'cool' vision to his target audience, and boy did it hit the target audience all right, this film was lapped up by every film major east and west, degrading a generation of potential artists into thinking this was how it was done. Sad, sad, sad, sad, and not in the way the director intended..",1,8,18,15 April 2007
United 93," Truly disturbing
","It took me a while to gather the strength to see this film. I live in New York, I am, many of us are, a part of this story. I went to see it several hours ago, right after the life sentencing of Zacarias Moussaoui - I wasn't going to see it, but somehow this sentencing provoked me to buy a ticket, sit in the dark with fifteen or so total strangers, and completely immerse myself in this. In effect, I just re-lived with shocking and visceral realism, the events of September 11, 2001. I lost it. I cried throughout the whole film, starting with one moment towards the beginning when one of the hijackers, Ziad Jarrah, calls his fiancée from the airport terminal and tells her he loves her. The only reason I know his name is because I have read up on the history of each of the perpetrators - this film does not name names, there is no 'central character', though there are recognizable ones (Todd Beamer comes to mind), and aboard flight 93 Jarrah was the only hijacker with any semblance of a normal life outside of his fundamentalist lifestyle, he did not break off relations with his family, friends, or his fiancée, whom he reportedly called minutes before boarding the aircraft. There was something about this moment that gave me a terrible sinking feeling in the bottom of my stomach, a feeling that can best be described as the horrible inevitability of everything. The feeling remained, and it is still in me as I am writing this. I was amazed, first off, at the skill of this film. It is an incredibly tight and realistic piece of film-making and quite unlike anything I have ever seen. I thought, though very difficult to watch in areas, it was tasteful, and did not stoop to gratuitous violence, and in the few areas music was used, it did not impede on the narrative, and didn't try to falsely elevate the drama in any scene - something I am so thankful for because I would not only have been truly disappointed had this film resorted to any cliché, but probably also angry. The story was told with respect, and with honor, and avoided cliché's as a rule. The hand-held photography really does lend to the story, I'm not usually a fan of this technique, however it worked because over the course of the film the camera-work became more unstable and shakier, until the final moments which were confused blur. This film, more than any I have ever seen has the ability to do two things, and this depends on the state of the viewer. It seems like it could either pacify or radicalize people in their opinions on what America's role is in the world and in this 'war on terror'. In the back of the theatre (Village East, New York City) a woman began to laugh hysterically during the final moments of this film. I could feel the animosity of the crowd, and there were loud 'Shhhh's. But this demonstrated to me the complete absurdity of life on this planet.",10,2,6,3 May 2006
John Wick," Might as well be playing a video game
","John Wick starts with promise and quickly devolves into stupidity, hijacking the current template for action films pioneered by 'The Raid' series in which a single, determined 'hero' takes up arms against hundreds of nameless, one dimensional bad guys in a rapid fire killing spree. It's not that I have anything against bloodshed in film, provided it serves a purpose. But there's really nothing of substance here to grab onto, leaving us with scene after scene of revenge-murder chic that plays more like a video game than a film. Never has cold blooded murder looked so cool.John Wick is nicely shot and opens on a dreary and mysterious note, one that I wish the film would have sustained with a better story and better character development. Without the fundamentals we might as well be pressing buttons. Jump, Wick. Dive, Wick. Shoot, Wick.If I try and step back and critique it purely as action entertainment - the film is lacking in interesting choreography or chase sequences. Basically Wick happens upon completely unbelievable scenarios over and over again, pulls a gun out and shoots. No matter how many times the filmmakers put him into uncompromising positions, I never feel like he's in any danger. The routine gets boring after the first half hour and eventually the autopilot sets in.",5,2,14,24 January 2015
The Irishman," Scorsese's Mafia Meditation
","The Irishman is a really great film, albeit one that took me a couple viewings to fully get behind, and it might, ironically, given Scorsese's penchant for a theatrical experience, be better suited for the small screen than the big.This film was a challenge in the cinema. Aside from its epic runtime (sans intermission) and languorous pacing, I was fundamentally disappointed with the CGI work on the actors, and how the de-aging process translated to the big screen. It was far less 'obvious' and unsettling on a smaller screen, which it appears designed for. Blowing up aging actors to cinema size, warping their features and expecting me to suspend disbelief was a step too far on first viewing, and I couldn't shake the sensation that in many scenes Joe Pesci looked more like Gollum than Russell Bufalino.But by the second viewing I had gotten more used to it, and focused more on the story, details, and the acting behind the tech. The actors all shine, and the script by Steve Zaillan, which on first viewing felt had too much lard, now feels full of zest, and taut, essential scenes which amount to an epic meditation on the mob.Scorsese's signatures are all there and more pronounced than ever - his love of a moving camera, old music and actors from his repertoire. His merging of murder and domesticity, as seen here in Pesci's Bufalino explaining calmly to De Niro's Sheeran how they 'did all they could' for Hoffa, as he tosses and tastes home made salad dressing, or the choosing of an arsenal by laying the weapons out on a bed, a throwback to Taxi driver. And lots and lots of wine, and lots of bread.The film does appear to fully commit to this particular Hoffa narrative, and whether the reality is as close to the film is impossible to know. There have been many accounts from those in-the-know who have deemed the Irishman Frank Sheeran a fabricator. But the point of this film is not to bring history precisely to life. This is a film about people who have done bad things, and have to live with or die by those decisions. And about how those who outlive the consequences still have to live with themselves.",9,2,5,9 December 2019
Zodiac," Fincher's maturation but ruined by Viper Camera
","Years on I am editing this. I was turned off initially by my Zodiac theatrical experience. But I have come back to this film time and time again on DVD and find it to be really masterful, and one of the best things David Fincher has done. But I'll leave my old review below, for posterity. I will have to split this into two parts because I was conflicted. Honestly, I did love what Fincher was trying to do- make a narrative film that wasn't propelled by gore or special camera tricks, but by story. I loved the acting, particularly Robert Downey Jr, the subtle script developments, the mystery surrounding this case. I was first in line to see it. But I was also the first, I think, to walk out. I couldn't stand Fincher's use of the Thomson Viper cam, and the films I've seen with that camera in general, which include Michael Mann's last two films. I understand the advantages of shooting like this, much more flexibility in low light situations, the ability to basically have a hard drive replace the film reel, keep everything categorized digitally for direct digital transfer for editing, maintaining low costs and so on. But this is David Fincher. And Michael Mann. What on earth are these guys doing cutting costs by sacrificing image quality??? I could understand why someone like Woody Allen might want to make a talkie on the fly like this, but these guys have built careers out of moods defined by their cinematography. The film might have looked good in post, but was decidedly grainy on the big screen. I was sitting in the front row on opening night and I was literally squinting my eyes, simultaneously trying to make out details that would have been directly visible on film, and sheltering them from the oncoming headache created by watching miniature pixels float around in front of me.",10,0,2,15 April 2007
Hotel Rwanda," Embarrassing , Manipulative garbage!
","I was conflicted for about two seconds before deciding to give a film like this a bad review, a film that I really am a minority in since it was widely praised and reached by some miraculous flight to number 62 in the IMDb top 250. It's just a shameless and grueling piece of film-making, and I can't help but feel disgusted that the Rwandan genocide has been reduced and distilled by Hollywood into this. The injustice is overbearing. As someone who was in lower Manhattan on 9/11, I resented Oliver Stone for making his swan song 'World Trade Center', another hand wringing piece of garbage that was so disconnected from the reality of the event it was laughable, which is terrible because the last thing you want is to see such an inaccurate reflection of events to where you are forced by the director to sneer and feel uncomfortable at a film about it. Believe me, people, there were no violins playing in Rwanda while this was going on. I appreciate how people are waking up to genocide and injustice in Africa and how Don Cheadle has taken his research from this film and gone on to bring tremendous public awareness to places like Sudan, but that is all I can give this.For one, it does nothing to speak of the actual problems that led to the genocide in the first place, leaving an audience that might not know about the lead up to this story (and I do think the target audience for this film has no idea where Rwanda is on a map) to come to the conclusion that there is such thing as 'faceless evil', as arbitrary as some of the worst crimes humanity has ever encountered are, things aren't this simple, black-white, right-wrong. I think this kind of mentality has led the way for Bush's statements on 'good and evil' and 'evildoers' to be taken at face value, without questioning the social, political, religious, or moral conflicts that might have led to an act of genocide like this, or an act like September 11. I suggest instead of watching this film and thinking you have learned something about history, you pick up a book like 'The Graves are Not Yet Full' to understand the complex dynamics in Africa, dynamics that have led to generations being wiped out by ethnic cleansing and tribal conflict. I worry that a film like this closes out on a still ongoing argument, leaving the viewer with a feeling that even in the face of humanity's most vile action, 'everything will be okay' with people like Paul Rusesabagina around. This simply is not true. This film made me viscerally angry. This wasn't simply a 'bad movie', I feel like it stepped over a personal boundary, my own human boundary and insulted me, and literally millions of other people that have to endure life's struggle as it's given to them. I watch this and I feel ashamed to only have to endure the hour and a half of this film, and that is the stark low point of my day. I feel ashamed to even afford a ticket to waste on this movie. It's watered down, inaccurate film-making at it's most manipulative point, and that is what makes me angry, not to mention Don Cheadle's embarrassing attempt to 'be African' while driving in carefully placed advertisements for Volkswagon. Really he is a just sheltered like the rest of us, a Hollywood movie star sucking in fat paychecks while there is real, not dramatized, suffering in the world just adds to the pain of watching the film. I saw 'Sometimes in April' recently and found this to be much more believable and affecting a film, I would recommend this well above 'Hotel Rwanda'. The realities are still out there, this is fantasy. I know this is harsh, but this film insults my intelligence as a film-goer and as a human being.",1,22,46,8 April 2007
Molly's Game," Writing that jumps from the page
","Sorkin has always been a stellar writer, but in recent years he has honed his craft so precisely in biopics that the next sensible step would of course be to try his hand at directing his own script. Thankfully, he's now proven that he knows what he's doing behind the camera just as well as he knows how to write a gripping scene.And scene after scene in Molly's game jumps off the page like the best scripts do. The actors all seem to be relishing in the freedom of strong characterization and dialogue that they are completely aware will land as intended. Acting out a Sorkin script must be a wet dream for many who dedicate themselves to the craft.Molly's game follows a somewhat classic arc: a character rises in the underworld, gaining power through deceit and immorality, until things start to crumble and fall in pieces around them. In this case, the character is Molly, played wonderfully by Jessica Chastain in her strongest role to date; a strong, wily woman who carries the film on her own shoulders like the wind is on her back.I also love a film where you learn something about a process you never thought much about before. The mechanics of how underground poker games are run are so well described in Molly's Game, that it anchors the film into something true and gripping, and we are engrossed because we are learning something as well as being wildly entertained by the scripts oratorical pleasures, (and some excellent and surprising casting decisions.)I appreciated this film a lot, for its commitment to characters, plot and script, fundamentals which are sometimes overlooked in lieu of style or effects. The film surely has a strong, defined style about it, but it smartly refuses to be overruled by the carefully constructed foundation underlying it.Great film, with a re-watchability factor built in.",9,1,2,16 December 2018
Crash," Paul Haggis wants to be God, the moral arbiter. But really, he's just Paul Haggis.
","I hate this movie. Oh, did I hate this movie. It actually started all right, the music set the tone, the colors, the camera movement.. But it all went down hill from there. I can't stand it when a director is so self driven he decides he must be the moral arbiter of all things. It's like an Evangelical cornering you on the street and telling you why he is right, only he, not you, you won't be saved unless you follow God's way. Only the guy is delusional and he isn't really thinking of your best interest or God's, but rather his own. Paul Haggis sat his pompous royal Hollywood butt on a pedestal made of melted gold Oscar statuettes above me and told me: This is how it is, and it is no other way. I see this disturbing trend in films a lot these days (re: Steven Soderbergh, Darren Aronofsky, Alejandro Innaritu), I mean I can feel their perceived superiority over the viewer, instead of engaging them with a serious debate, which each of these films act under the guise of being open to, they closed the argument long ago in their heads. A movie like this insults me. Is there a universal truth? Most certainly. Does anybody understand it? No, and most certainly not Paul frigging' fried Haggis, as much as he tries to convince us he knows what we do not.",1,11,17,17 April 2007
Capote," Hoffman brilliant in otherwise lackluster film
","I really wanted to like this movie. But it was doomed to start, since I found myself repelled by Capote, and sympathetic towards Perry Smith. This is not the fault of the script, since Capote was so much the odd narcissist in reality, I just found myself removed and uncaring for anyone by the end of the film, and no matter how true this is to life, I don't want to sit through any film and not care about any of the characters. Thats not to say it was bad either. Philip Seymour Hoffman will win the Oscar for this role, his performance was the single light in the whole film, if he had not been in it, it would have failed entirely in my mind. He drove the wagon here, and everything else just came off like background noise. I read In Cold Blood, which I thought was brilliant, then I saw the film and didn't enjoy it as much as everybody else seemed to. Same goes here, I read his biography, loved it, and didn't think it translated into film. It was simply meandering and boring and at times over-dramatic for my tastes - I love slow, moving thoughtful pictures, and in a land inundated by floodwater, it was definitely refreshing to see 'Good Night and Good Luck' and 'Capote' in the same week. But I found this sprawling, poorly edited, beautifully photographed in neutral tones that only served to match the distance I felt from all the characters and the story. And I was extremely disappointed by one scene of gratuitous violence: The climax and one of the best acted monologues I've seen in a while takes place in the prison where Capote is interviewing Smith and has finally gotten him to talk about the night he murdered the Clutter family. Clifton Collins Jr, whom I had never seen before was incredible, and speaks with raptured intensity, while the camera centers on his sunken eyes. This was literally the first time in the film I was entirely captivated, Then, there's a flashback and some fancy jump cuts and you're taken to the night of the murders where we see him committing them. I found this entirely unnecessary in the context of this film. While the violence in the flashback was restrained compared to other violent films, it de-captivated me and contaminated the rest of the experience. I'm not against violence in pictures, but I'm against bad decisions made by directors. I could not find a purpose for it. We are for the entire film in Capote's head, seeing everything from his perspective, so why now are we suddenly inside Smith's head? Is it supposed to show some kind of transference that occurred between them in that moment? Did he psychically transmit those images to Capote's head? Or was it just to shock the audience? If it was it did just the opposite, it turned an otherwise disturbing and effective monologue into a novelty, my imagination is such that I believed for that moment that Collins was Perry Smith, and that he had murdered those people and I was really feeling the pain that both of them felt during that confession, and the moment it flashed back and the music started up we're back in movie land. Utterly confusing. See it for Hoffman.",5,1,5,23 October 2005
Lost in Translation," One of the few perfect films
","Lost in Translation either works or it doesn't work for you - and for many people it's a bargain for somewhere in between. It can be seen as a drama, and in many venues it was billed as a comedy - but for a certain segment of the audience it is I believe a profoundly moving and devastating story about an impossible love, told with simplicity and attention to detail; and with such careful modulation that the ground shakes during it's final moments. The criticism I've heard leveled at the film most often is that it dwells on the problems of the 'super rich', when the film isn't about that. The fact that these characters are from this background was the only way Coppola could tell this story in earnest; these characters are extensions of herself, and like it or not she was born into this kind of world. The purpose of the story isn't to evoke sympathy for the problems in these people's lives - rather, there's a universality to this idea that no matter where we are in this world, no matter how well things are going in our lives, we all have the ability to feel stranded. And no matter how stranded we feel in our lives, when the light of a human connection finds us it has the potential to illuminate our entire being.",10,2,4,14 January 2013
Barry Lyndon," Kubrick's best film
","I know that the statement 'Barry Lyndon is Kubrick's best film' is controversial. Really his films can't be weighed against each other, and obviously I speak for myself. Although I STRONGLY believe that statement - I will amend it and say simply that it's my favorite film, and yes, I do hold this film in higher regard than any other. Don't ask me why but there's something about it that makes me come back to it year after year, sometimes multiple times a year.. I think it is a miracle of cinema.It is also a deeply subversive and ironic film that takes your expectations of what a period romance or swashbuckling adventure should be and turns it around, providing you with neither. The opening shots are hazy in the style of a gaudy romance, but this is all quickly undermined when we begin to understand who Barry Lyndon is. He surely is one of the most empty and lazy 'protagonist's ever put to film, so much so that one can hardly call Barry a protagonist as he seems to try so hard to do or succeed at nothing.But somehow we are entranced by his character, and our fascination grows as the lies he tells and ripples he creates throughout the story begin to affect others. He builds a tower around himself which is always threatening to topple. There is a point near the end of the film where you feel Barry staring off, blinking, as though he has just woken up out of his own dream. It's as if he has no idea how he got there.The film is even more moving to watch today - the fact that people still call films 'films' when so much is just video.. Watching Barry Lyndon is watching the cinematographic process at its peak. It has to be one of the most beautiful films ever shot, (and one of the most perfectly lit). It's like a painting come to life. I'm saddened to see the medium of film die out in the way that it is, it makes Barry Lyndon feel all the more like a lost treasure. I urge you to see it, it's one of a kind.",10,6,10,1 February 2013
Interstellar," Decent sci-fi for the masses
","Interstellar contains some of the most magnificent imagery you will see in any film this year; it is gorgeous to look at, technically spectacular, and creatively executed. But there are problems at some of the most basic levels. What the movie lacks is a believable script and striking, three dimensional characters to propel us onto this journey. And unlike two obvious reference points - Contact and 2001: A Space Odyssey, it doesn't have the scientific authority (i.e. a Carl Sagan or an Arthur C. Clarke) to bring its high minded concept to life in a believable fashion. Not that a film needs to be scientifically sound to be enjoyable, but Interstellar tries so hard to be profound and amazing that it lags in other crucial areas. Dialogue, pacing, and character development should have been locked in place before they conceived of taking an audience up into space with these people. What makes it all the more frustrating is that so many of the pieces seem to be in place, including a buffet of great actors who pop up with such frequency that we lose count - John Lithgow, Ellen Burstyn, Wes Bentley, Casey Affleck, Jessica Chastain, Topher Grace, Michael Caine etc etc all make respective appearances before disappearing entirely from our memories. Best among the bunch is Matthew McConaughey, who does his damned best to wring a performance out of his role as good ol' farmer/physicist Coop, but without the emotional tendrils, he's left drifting. Coop is decidedly McConoughey's least interesting or dynamic role since 2008's Surfer Dude. There are positives. The film has some moments of real invention - particularly when the crew start making their way through worm holes and black holes. These are the most interesting and beautiful visualizations of these phenomena I have ever seen, and the sheer detail of the visual effects during these sequences is astonishing, and Nolan's choice of slowing down the action long enough for us to reflect on its beauty is in the spirit of 2001's most evocative scenery. The film's score by Hans Zimmer is gorgeous, a hymnal ode to mankind which gives the impression that the entire soundtrack has been filtered through a cathedral. Like I said, a film like this will predictably shoot up the IMDb's top 200. It's designed for mass appeal, with just enough profundity to appeal to the critics. It will be nominated for lots and lots of stuff. And it should. But personally I want a film that has a bit more integrity at the script level.",6,1,6,7 November 2014
Nightcrawler," Stunning performance carries the film
","Jake Gyllenhaal gives one of his best performances in a film that is deftly crafted and compliments his work brilliantly. I know Gilroy has been in the industry for some time, but it's always great to see the work of a first time director and go 'wow'. Doesn't happen too often. It's a gripping piece, doesn't spoon feed; relevant topic and offbeat dialog really make this film come alive on contact. It's a great feeling to be in the theater and to sense that there is a steady, deliberate hand at work behind the machines. Elswit behind the camera is always an honor, as is the brilliant sight of 35mm film grain - we aren't treated to that enough anymore. The look, acting and writing give this film an authority to it that not many films can seem to muster these days. Great film, accessible, intelligent, and overall well played.",9,3,7,1 November 2014
Little Miss Sunshine," Overrated light fluffy comedy for the masses
","Okay, I'll admit it the first time I sat through this in the theater I had a good time. The sun was out, the seasons were changing, I was in the mood for something like this. Perhaps the theater experience of a film like this is what matters - everybody having a good, light laugh together. But then I forgot about it. Quickly. While the rest of the world didn't. And I was sitting there minding my own business when this film kind of took over, and I couldn't help but be reminded of what a great little indie film this was! I shrugged. It didn't go away. So, okay, I watched it again, to humor my little sister. But this time my grin was crooked and bent into a kind of snarl. I started to feel the darkness rising... Sunny? Sunny? What the &%$# is this garbage? I looked around me. I was the only one who was feeling the darkness during this showing of Sunshine. When it was over, I went to go be by myself. I felt alienated. Am I a bad person? I thought over and over. Everybody else seems to be having such a good time... Why can't I just.. join the party? The movie still didn't disappear. Next thing you know it's up for a bunch of Oscars, while I'm still sitting in dark disbelief in the corner, feeling alienated. The next time, I was forced to watch it. 'C'mon!' They said. 'Everybody loves it!' I was beginning to resent humanity at this point. I was shaking so badly by the end of this last viewing that I wanted to shout at the screen, 'did you really ever read Marcel Proust? Why are you defecating on his name like this?!' I was flabbergasted. Nobody I was with had even heard of Marcel Proust before this film. I guess that's what I'm trying to say. This film is for most ordinary people. And most ordinary people haven't read Marcel Proust. Yeah, the kid is cute. Did she deserve an Oscar nomination? No. Did Alan Arkin deserve the Oscar? No. Did Michael Arndt deserve the Oscar above the Queen, Pan's Labyrinth, or Letters From Iwo Jima? ABSOLUTELY NOT! AM I REALLY THE CRAZY ONE HERE OR IS EVERYBODY ELSE JUST CRAZY?",3,6,13,27 March 2007
The Lego Movie," Awesome send up
","Lego Movie is almost in a genre of its own, appealing to kids but I suspect adults will like it more. It's entertaining, with many genuinely hilarious moments, so with respect to shelling out 20+ dollars for a 3D ticket - YES it's worth it. As a film it feels a little more uneven, but the proceedings are so creative that they kinda defy criticismI was really taken by the opening sections, the introduction into the world with the ecstatically happy music and utopian Lego urban landscape I thought was brilliant. But overall I felt there the mocking tone overtook the sincere areas and it ultimately makes the surprise ending hard to take seriously, or to feel moved by. It's crazy fun though - especially in 3D.",8,2,5,22 March 2014
Spirited Away," MIyazaki's Magical Mystery Tour
","I would give everything in my life to sustain the feeling I get from watching the minute and a half sequence of Chihiro taking the ghost train submerged in water... You know what I'm talking about. This moment is one of the most special I've ever seen, it evokes a mystical feeling deep inside myself, and it's a feeling that I might live for. It's a carefully orchestrated affair, this moment could only work after experiencing the hour that came before, in the key that came before, everything about this minute, from the music, the subtle taint of computer animation, to the magical imagery might be what Werner Herzog means when he talks about 'an ecstatic truth'. Not many films achieve this moment, and it is incredibly hard to define, but it strikes deep in a person's core, in his soul...",10,1,2,9 April 2007
Lawrence of Arabia," Opera in Super Panavision 70
","Firmly cemented in history as one of cinemas greatest achievements, I've yet to come across someone who didn't like or respond to this movie positively in some way. It brings the viewer such a sense of wonder and amazement, it would take a particularly steel gated and disinterested individual to leave this masterpiece and not be affected - this is one of those rare films that can be appreciated on all sorts of levels, and if you are one of those people that don't find life itself interesting, this is one of those rare films that might change your mind. The key dramatic elements are simple: what draws you in to the story is the relationship between two characters that are seemingly so opposite and arrive from such different background that putting them together in the story is like watching a high school chemistry experiment run amok; you are aware of the dangers involved in their pairing, know that while neither is safe around each other, that neither can ever fully trust another, you don't care and want to watch their relationship unfold until the very end. I'm of course speaking about Lawrence and Ali, and their first meeting takes place in one of cinemas greatest scenes. From here on, you're hooked...",10,3,5,12 April 2007
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Beautifully crafted, but pointless violence mars a great film
","What can I say? Tarantino is so talented, has so much fun, yet his penchant for over-the-top revenge violence has, over his last several films, begun to feel like a serious crutch.I almost feel like his film is decades too late. And that this sort of violence glorification - regardless of the director's intentions, good nature, the fact Sharon is 'spared' etc etc - is now well past its prime, and spoils the otherwise clever, good spirited vibe. It is also completely predictable. Morally, never mind, we have long crossed the threshold of questioning a mainstream film on its propensity for hardcore violence, but that doesn't mean one has to enjoy it, or pay money for it.So, sadly, I really enjoyed Â¾ of this film, and hated the rest.Still, this is probably Tarantino's best film since Inglorious Basterds, but none of his films past Kill Bill Vol 2 have been as good as before. Perhaps it is because his editor died tragically, that a certain restraint has been lost, but his films used to be a lot tighter - RD, Pulp and Jackie Brown are still masterful studies in cinematic restraint, without sacrificing an iota of entertainment value. His more recent outings have been sprawling, obsessed with themselves, intensely violent, and all seem to be following a formula which invariably ends in some kind of shocking comical massacre, which is still bookended by so much well crafted material that it genuinely shocks. This is not B-movie violence.There are some magnificent sequences in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, some hilarious moments, a really good buddy-movie set up, great actors and tight dialog throughout that doesn't ramble, but gets to the point. I appreciated all this. I just wish Tarantino would consider once, that maybe to be truly shocking, all he would need to do is pull the reins in.",7,2,7,1 November 2019
Django Unchained," Tarantino has lost his mojo
","I was deeply disappointed by Django Unchained and constantly had to resist the urge to walk out. I didn't find it entertaining, it was too long, and I didn't find it altogether that funny or interesting to regard either. I know I'm in a minority and the films rapid ascent to the top 100 of IMDb no doubt will imbue Tarantino with the confidence to make three sequels to this film. I think that would be a terrible mistake. Tarantino's best film was Jackie Brown, and since then I think the quality of tightness of his films have gone downhill. They've become more self indulgent, more tongue in cheek, less biting, more reliant on shock and gratuitous violence than narrative intrigue. I actually found myself bored during Django, checking my watch periodically. Not a good sign, especially when talking about Tarantino- a man who seems destined to inoculate his audiences against boredom. The plot didn't hold my attention simply because it was a replica of so many plots that came before. Man sees girl, girl in danger, man saves girl. Never do we believe Django or the girl are ever actually in danger, so apparently Tarantino believes the one thing that will keep us glued to our seat is the expectation for more and more outrageous violence. I suppose he's right, and it's a sign of our times. I'm not a conservative type, and I have nothing against violence in movies. I don't, however, particularly enjoy violence for the sake of violence, and don't find a three hour long murder spree fun. I don't like Tarantino singling out innocent people and slaughtering them for fun (and believe me he tries hard to make it fun). Killing slave masters are one thing, but this film goes out of its way to kill the families of these people too. I don't find Django or the good Doctor Shulz heroic, or cool, or fun. Maybe it's just me. Maybe I've just grown up a little too much. Maybe I just don't know how to have fun anymore, the same way I don't sit for hours on end playing video games the way I did in high school. There's no point to it, and it bores me.",3,15,23,1 February 2013
Call Me by Your Name," A dreamy masterpiece
","Call Me by Your Name had me hypnotized early on, kept me curious throughout, and it ultimately reveals itself as one of the great coming-of-age love stories. This here is a film told with masterful restraint, with enormous respect for cinematic language and vision, shot in lush 35mm and it transported me to a time and place so specifically that I had to jar my head and reconnect with my surroundings when it was over. It is a great treat for the senses.The story is simple. It is the summer of 1983 and we meet a teenager, Elio (Timothee Chalamet) who lives with his family in a small village in northern Italy. His father (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a professor of history and archaeology, and invites a different graduate student to live with them each summer. This particular summer the student is a charming, strutting American, Oliver (Armie Hammer). What begins as a tense sharing-of-space between the Elio and Oliver, morphs into something else, at first unmentionable, dancing around the obvious subject. And then something deeper, until we are lost in it along with them.Yes, this film contains homosexual subject matter, but like Brokeback Mountain, another great film about love and loss, it transcends that narrow viewpoint and tells a story simply about two people sharing a moment in time. We aren't met with cliches about this sort of relationship, there are no moments of intolerance, of 'talking through it', of shame around having those feelings. There are challenging aspects to the subject, around the age difference of Elio and Oliver, which also go unmentioned. No, this film is not meant to contain a political or social message. It is about a young person's first love experience, and all the complexities and strangeness around that experience which rings true to life, because life is complicated too.The cinematography is spectacular. Avoiding typical postcard-like views of Italy, it was shot in intimate 35mm and the result is transportive, with crisp, bright blue skies, deep sun-drenched yellows and colors of lost summer memories and landscapes and views of Crema which jump out at you. Like Lost in Translation, shooting this on film creates an atmosphere of nostalgia and romance which is captured so perfectly by cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom.Call Me by Your Name is a beautifully told film which is so obviously a classic that it left me immediately spellbound, and stayed with me for days after.",10,1,4,16 September 2019
Children of Men," One of the best Science Fiction films ever made
","Ahhhh... Deep sigh... Finally it has started. Once in every other blue moon do films like this come out. I rank this with some of the best 'mood' sci-fi in cinema history, with Metropolis, the Empire Strikes Back, Blade Runner, 2001, Solaris, and more recently Minority Report and Dark City. So rare is it to go into the theatre these days and be completely and utterly awe struck by the power of a film, that when it was finished I immediately bought a ticket for the next showing and looped right back around and sat through it again. What an experience this was to sit through! A word that comes to mind is 'rich'. There is such careful construction to every aspect of Children of Men, I was flabbergasted when it was passed over for a production design nomination by the Academy. And personally I think the cinematography award was stolen as well... This is some tight, tight film-making right here. I wish I could write more but my brain can hardly process the impact this movie had on me.. I'm without words. I suggest you see this if you still can in the cinema, this deserves to be seen in surround sound in your face more than any other film this year.",10,3,6,2 April 2007
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," perfect minimalism
","I was really amazed at how intelligent this film was. It requires your full attention at all times, which is unheard of in modern cinema, let alone many of the films Clooney has acted in. I wish people on television today spoke with such articulation and thoughtfulness instead of over-dramatizing blurbs and the extreme forms of puppetry we see on Fox News. I saw Confessions of a Dangerous Mind and enjoyed it immensely, though I found parts of it meandering and in a way flawed, but it put Clooney in a whole new light, and I gained a tremendous amount of respect for him (which had been missing since I saw the Solaris remake). However I found this film perfect in every way, and I hope it garners him some Oscar nominations. Minimalist, (it all takes place in doors in television studios), captivating cinematography, sly and highly intelligent dialog that never resorts to using the 'F' word. Tense and intimate drama that transcends its subject matter and hopefully will resonate with younger crowds since it pertains to current situations. Perfect.",10,4,7,15 October 2005
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Finally somebody had fun making a Star Wars sequel
","Very refreshing to see this film after decades of disappointing post-original trilogy follow-ups. I felt the director and actors livened up for this outing, freed themselves of some of the pressures which might have marred the last two (The Force Awakens and the bleak spinoff Rogue One), films that felt stiff and unimaginative in comparison. Whereas I left the Force Awakens sorely disappointed at lack of new vision, I left the Last Jedi reinvigorated with hope that this franchise can actually live to bring new imaginative layers to the Star Wars universe. I've liked Johnson's previous films- not loved- but in my opinion he totally owns this world, and has now made his best film with the Last Jedi. There's a striking confidence and grasp of what made the originals so evocative while also shunning the 'dark fantasy' trend and bleakness of Rogue one; it is mercifully fun, and seems product of the love of creation. It is also as wildly inventive (especially on the creature front) as anything in the original trilogy. Well played.",9,2,13,5 January 2018
Prisoners," Dark and atmospheric thriller, can't sustain the power of the first half
","Prisoners is a careful step forward for Denis Villeneuve, a Quebec director staking his way into American territory this last year with two well received films - his first, the haunting 'Prisoners' is a solid US debut, a film so steeped in atmosphere that it spills out into the theatre. Prisoners is not a tremendous departure for Villeneuve, who has until now built a career upon these kinds of brainy, Fincher-like thrillers, but it works, mostly because the director was able to coax two very coiled and believable performances from his two leading men (Gyllenhaal delivers one of the best and strangest performances of his career). The film however is marred in the third act by overcomplicated plot devices and exposition, a shame because its ambiguity until that point was one of its greatest strengths. Otherwise a very watchable and visually haunting film.",7,0,2,28 March 2014
Avatar," Watching Avatar in 3D was like stepping into the future
","Avatar was the best film experience I have had in a theater. I am a huge film buff, and would not ordinarily find myself shortlisting a big budget Hollywood film for such a distinction, but for this I am making an exception. The film is not perfect, faltering in areas of writing and some acting, but as a cinematic experience it will remain unparalleled for years to come. The innovation in technology, particularly the RealD experience, was instrumental to the films power (I watched it in all three 3D systems - Dolby, IMAX and RealD - and found RealD to be the cleanest, least blurry, brightest and most immersive version of the film). A lot of this was nothing new - 3D had been employed successfully earlier that year with Pixar's 'Up' - and yet there is a sense when watching Avatar that you are watching the birth of a new kind of cinema. Part of this is how the technology is used in aid to the storytelling - instead of using 3D in gimmicky ways, Cameron uses it to subtly immerse us into the third dimension. Experiencing this transition from half an hour of monochromatic, nearly flat imagery into the world of Pandora is like falling asleep in this world to wake up in the middle of one of your most fantastic and memorable dreams. Yes, it is that powerful. Aside from this, there is very little I can say. If you missed seeing this in the theater, in 3D - you've missed the boat. I would never dare to rent this film or watch is on a smaller screen. And I would recommend to somebody who hasn't seen it - to wait until they re-release Avatar in theaters, even if it's ten years from now, it was designed to be seen in 3D - on a big screen- and that is how it should be experienced. Like a ride at an amusement park - pay the ticket and see it for REAL.",10,2,5,2 September 2012
Sicario," Skillfull filmmaking
","Sicario opens with a sense of dread that sustains itself for nearly the entirety of its running time - the cinematography, music, minimal dialogue and understated acting only adds to its effectiveness. I have seen each of Villeneuve's films since his first short -The Next Floor - and have watched him develop his style over time, and I think he has now delivered us his best film. If there is one criticism I might have towards his films is that they do sometimes favor style over fully coherent or satisfying narratives and conclusions. His themes are bleak, and his characters often hopeless and desperate. There is very little light to be found, very little redemption. There is only a sustained horror, and a feeling of profound and captivating inevitability. That said, Sicario was a haunting picture, and stayed with me for days. The atmosphere of a film and how it resonates into your soul sometimes will trump narrative inconsistencies, and I think that is true for Sicario. I can't wait to see his take on Blade Runner.",9,1,2,6 January 2016
The Descent," One of the most effective of all horror films!
","I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this was possibly the scariest damn movie I've seen. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is close on my list. Audition, perhaps. The Shining was more about a creepy atmosphere, but I personally wasn't scared by it's grotesque imagery, twin sisters, child voices, blood flooding, etc. It was a great film, but too surreal and technical to pull the correct nerves. Jaws really freaked me out when I was a kid, but now I watch it with nostalgia and amusement, as with the Exorcist. Again, movies like Friday the 13th and Pet Semetary were pure terror for kids, but now they play like camp slap comedy. Scream was a joke. And never mind the slew of slasher teen horror films that followed, and more recently Japanese horror remakes and ultra-violent trash released on in a wave the past few years, a la Hills Have Eyes, Hostel, Wolf Creek.. So with these all firmly implanted in my memory bank, I went into the theater with very low hopes for this little known Australian film. And it really messed me up! It was a great theater experience, and the director really knew what worked, what to tweak, what to modulate, all to heighten the effect on the viewer. First, and most importantly, he set up a story that was believable, with characters that you care for, and females that are (gasp) intelligent, and none are readily disposable bimbos, removing a chance for a 'Which blonde will die first?' guessing game in the first half hour. Second, time manipulation. Much like 'Jaws', the director makes you wait, and carefully builds the tension like a great musical piece. Third, story manipulation. It begins a tense, claustrophobic disaster story, then, when you think you're safely confined in the flow of a narrative *BAM!* it makes a sharp unexpected turn for the worst. Fourth, it plays on our deepest shared unconscious fears: claustrophobia, darkness, isolation, heights, intruders... Finally what greatly contributes to the experience is the editing and sound design. Cuts are very carefully made to shock, and the sound is amplified to maximize every small movement a character makes. I really can't recommend this enough, best to see it without any foreknowledge of the story line, because a certain 'entrance' it is quite a surprise!",10,3,6,28 April 2007
Steve Jobs," Why didn't people dig this?
","Steve Jobs garnered some lukewarm praise, few people went to see it, and it probably won't win many awards. But it should. Michael Fassbender proves himself to be one of the finest actors working today, and along with Michael Stuhlbarg, Kate Winslet and Seth Rogan shows us what a masterclass in acting can look like. The entire film hinges on writer Aaron Sorkin's rapid fire style and the powerful, empathetic acting to bring it to life. No, Fassbender does not resemble Steve Jobs physically, nor does he speak like him. Instead, what is most important, is that he crafts a character who is self contained and entirely believable in his own right. He succeeds fantastically. Danny Boyle's directing is mostly on point - I'm not a fan of his sweeping musical numbers and hyperactivity behind the camera, I almost would have liked to have seen this film pared down to the bare minimum, because ultimately the things that count are all there. I wish he would have let the writing and acting speak for itself and nix the faux-inspirational music which strikes me as jarring and not entirely in sync with the tone of the picture, but I understand that's his style and he kept it to a minimum. Nitpicks aside I was pleasantly surprised across the board.",8,0,3,27 December 2015
Joker," Boring and irrelevant
","Joker is anything but a masterpiece, although it certainly takes itself seriously enough and it tries harder than any movie in recent memory to be one (maybe the recent Star is Born tries harder). But I found it largely languorous, psychopathic in its intent and subsequent failure to move me on any level and, well, not worth even a laugh.I don't know what the point of this film is, since it doesn't really work as Batman lore, providing a shoddy psychological construct around the Joker's origins, and if the idea was to top either Nicholson or Ledger it failed me (Nolan's Joker vision is far more nihilistic, seemingly coming from nowhere, with a twisted, brutal sense of humor about him.) Here we are meant to empathize with poor disgruntled Arthur Fleck, which might have been easier had he not been fed so many obvious motivations for his disgruntlement, and propped up by such lazy writing.If Joker is meant to 'be a mirror' to our times, it fails again, to say anything relevant or novel about society, or about the US, or the mental health system or anything really that hasn't been said a million times before, and instead seems focused on taking itself really really seriously, and wants us to find sequences of the Joker dancing to Gary Glitter edgy and bombastic, when really these sequences are dull and incongruent deadweight.Fans will lambast the haters of this film, but frankly I was bored by its flat embrace of pointless amorality. I wanted better, more biting satire, more layers, more motivation. Instead we get superficial, ultra-violent and pointless dreck which says and means nothing, even while it looks swell, has a great cast and seemingly all the ingredients are in order. But maybe that's the trade off for giving the reigns of such a film to the Hangover director.",4,16,43,8 October 2019
The Deer Hunter," Flawed but Powerful Masterpiece
","There is no doubting that is a great film, a monument to a tremendous amount of work and care, a showcase for some of the best actors in a generation, and stunning cinematography. And it was John Cazale's last film, a brilliant ending to a short but incredible career. It won many awards, fixed the director a place in history (and possibly enough power to never have to work in this capacity again), and has gone down in history as one of the greatest films of all time. But it is a flawed masterpiece, as much as those flaws don't ultimately matter when surrounded with such mastery, I couldn't help but notice them on my last viewing. The unconvincing and jarring mid-section surrounding the classic scene with Christopher Walken playing Russian roulette seemed stapled together, from when DeNiro returned to the States, only to return to Saigon and find Walkin's character with such ease and join him at the roulette table. Somehow this seemed forced... But, well there is not much else. The scenes in Vietnam are some of the most realistic and disturbing images ever burned to celluloid, however the Asians in the film come off stereotyped into typical enemy roles (Cimino was later criticized for stereotyping Chinese in his film 'the Year of the Dragon' - apparently he doesn't learn well!), but I suppose thats missing the point- the film is about brotherhood, war, peace, love, devotion, and patriotism. I preferred this to 'Apocalypse Now', another epic Vietnam film by a director who was in no way involved in Vietnam...",9,0,0,6 April 2007
Cloud Atlas," Ambitious, gorgeous and utterly incomprehensible
","I rate ambition over comprehension in many cases, and Cloud Atlas is no exception. The film is an extraordinary feat of creativity, while asking extraordinary patience from its viewers. That said, I am glad it was made and that there are people in the world who aim to make films of this magnitude. It covers centuries in time, a multitude of characters, often played by the same actor, cutting back and forth so relentlessly between time periods, story lines and realities that at a certain point you have to sit back and either accept it, or reject it. If you reject it, you are in for a long haul, if you accept it, there are many layers of magic to be found beneath the surface. It warrants repeated viewings. Sometimes the mixture feels like two different films battling for the same space, and indeed it was made by three filmmakers, all accomplished in their own right. An interesting experiment, and it yielded a mind bending film. But good luck explaining it to anyone unless they're prepared to sit over a cup of tea and a note pad.",8,0,2,16 August 2013
Jackie Brown," One of the greatest crime films
","Reportedly, Elmore Leonard read the Tarantino-penned script of Jackie Brown and proclaimed it the best screenplay he'd ever read. This wasn't hyperbole - watching Jackie Brown is watching dialogue glide right off the page onto the screen in a fashion you don't often get to see. Jackie Brown is the ultimate writer's film, an action film where the dialogue is the action. Tarantino balances the film's narrative complexity with genuine emotional involvement and (shock) a believable love story and the result is so brilliant it seems almost effortless. Perhaps this is why people consistently rate Jackie Brown below many of his other films. It all looks a little too easy, a little too cool. Well, it's my feeling that this film represented the peak of Tarantino's monopoly on 'cool' in films, and that his output post Brown has been a constant battle to maintain that status or to win it back. Tarantino has said he would never adapt another film. I think that's too bad, as this film represents what I believe is the greatest film to Tarantino's credit. Jackie Brown is fantastic cinema told with balls to the wall confidence.",10,1,4,4 February 2013
