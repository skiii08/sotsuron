Casablanca," Great movie with amazing writing and actors
","When I first heard of this movie I thought I was not going to like it because of how popular it is. I was mistaken, I can now see that it is popular for very good reason.This is the first movie I have ever seen Humphrey Bogart in and I was impressed. His nonchalant, yet bad ass attitude makes him an amazing actor to watch. He perfectly represents the United States at the time that this movie took place.But the best thing about this movie is the writing, every sentence of dialogue is a work of art and the actors delivering them clearly respect those works of art.",Null,1,2,14 October 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," A really well made film.
","This movie surprised me, I thought it would have been a lot worse than it ended up being. The writing in this movie was overall really good, with many strong monologues. I think the editing in this movie was also done really great, the pacing never got boring for me. The lighting was pretty good, although it did get maybe a little too dark at times during some of the last scenes.But my favorite thing about this movie is Henry Fonda. This is my first time seeing a movie starring him and I must say that I am really impressed. He seems like an actor that could take on any role and be really good in it.",Null,0,1,12 October 2011
The Graduate," Great movie of it's time.
","This movie is a very well made movie and broke many new grounds in the themes that were presented in it. This is the movie that made Dustin Hoffman the star that he is seen as today. And it is no wonder, he plays his role so well in this movie you would think he is actually going through the situation. But the best acting in this movie has to obviously go to Anne Bancroft. She is mazing in this movie and it is no wonder her character in this movie is referenced in so many other mediums.Another amazing thing about this movie is the filming. It is so well done and you can tell the director of photography spent a lot of time to make each and every shot count.",9,1,2,1 December 2011
Singin' in the Rain," I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.
","I have never been a fan of musicals, but this movie was surprisingly entertaining and kept my interest the whole way through, minus a couple of songs that went for for a bit too long. That being said, this movie has not changed my opinion about musicals, they just are not my thing. And that is because this movie was not like most of the musicals I have seen before, this one was dialogue that was forced into song, it was dance and song numbers that conversations led into. The lead actor, Gene Kelly is amazing. His performance throughout the movie is very solid. But, the person who steals the whole movie without having the biggest part by far is Donald O'Connor. His performance during the 'Make 'em Laugh' song makes everyone else in the movie look like a bunch of amateurs. I have never before been impressed by someone's dancing before in my life until this movie and that part of it.",Null,0,1,7 November 2011
Psycho," Amazing.
","This classic horror movie does not disappoint. Hitchcock's signature suspense shines through throughout this entire movie. Alfred Hitchcock's movies innovated the way movies are edited and is the reason why the suspense works in this movie and the reason why every horror movie after this movie basically follow the same format to create suspense. None of which come close to nay Alfred Hitchcock horror movie.The lighting in this movie is also really good and adds a lot to the atmosphere of the whole movie. The acting in this movie is also really good, even though one of the main characters is killed off early, she plays a role in the best scene, the infamous shower scene.",Null,0,0,9 November 2011
Rosemary's Baby," Super creepy movie that is amazingly made.
","This movie is down right creepy, which makes it an achievement. I did not think movies of this era could be so creepy (code or no code). Mia farrow does an amazing job in such a demanding role. You can see her change over the course of the film from a happy newlywed to a scared, paranoid basket case. It is incredible. You just feel worse and worse for this poor women as everything around her falls to pieces. Her husband goes behind her back but at the same time forces her into doing things she does not, the old neighbors manipulate her and almost everyone that is helpful to the poor girl commits suicide or dies. Leading up to the worst part of all, giving birth to the son of Satan!",9,1,2,1 December 2011
