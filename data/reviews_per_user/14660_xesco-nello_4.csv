The King's Speech," g-g-g-great!
","The king's speech is the story of king George the VI, of how he had to become king (because his brother wanted to marry a divorcÃ©e),and how he stammered and went to see an Australian speech therapist. This is a very enjoyable film; the acting's great, the cast is wonderful and the script is very theatrical. Normally this kind of film wants to give you a good feeling about old fashioned values which is tricky to achieve, but in this case it works and almost makes you wish you lived at that time. The adding of funny bits is very successful and in the moments when he has to give any kind of speech it's very tense (in a good way I mean). The film leaves you with a very curious feeling; you kind of think how it would be to stammer, and you might also think that if you've got any problem in life it's not as bad as you think. So I guess if you're reading this to know if it's worth going to see it on the big screen, my answer is OF COURSE!",9,0,1,31 December 2010
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," outstanding!
","David Yates really wanted to try a new kind of Harry Potter, and the fact that Harry, Ron and Hermione aren't in school helped him, also that this is the last episode, so he's trying hard to make the best of it. They also cut it at a pretty good bit, it's cliff hanging, but it was the best they could do(they might want to make the final battle long, that's why they went far more than half of the book.If you're a grown up and you're checking this review because you're children want to see it and you think it will be maximum action, don't think that, just please go and see it and you will probably realize you enjoyed it, of course you should now quite a lot of the story and should read the books(if you don't have done it already). There are also some funny bits, of course they couldn't just make it really serious in the middle of this drama.",9,0,0,23 November 2010
Avatar," One of my favourite movies
","Avatar is the story of a paraplegic marine that is sent to the world of Pandora to complete a mission in which he has to turn into an avatar(bodies made by mixing DNA of the humans and DNA of the natives of Pandora)and convince the natives to move from they're residence(basically because they are living in a tree which is just on top of the most richest deposit of the rock the humans are looking for). As I said this is one of my favourite movies, it's just so well invented, all this connection with nature really makes you think of creation itself. What's pretty clear is the relation with cowboys and Indians, if you think of it, the natives are the Indians that live in they're land and the humans are the cowboys invading there land, people might disagree with this thought but It's one of the most probable ideas James Cameron wanted to transmit:the conquest of America. Sam Worthington was really good in the film as Sully(the protagonist), this movie will make to him what 'Inception' made to Leonardo Dicaprio, or what 'Gladiator' made to Russell Crowe. People are actually saying that Sam Worthington is the new Russell Crowe, who's to say there wrong! The relation idea is for two main things in my opinion: 1- They are both from Australia 2- The both of them worked in there first 'grand' movie with very good and experienced directors.I went to see Avatar two times at the cinema, it might be because it's a good cinema film!",10,4,9,16 January 2011
Inception," Best Nolan movie ever!
","I went to the cinema thinking I might not understand it, that feeling got reinforced at the start of the movie, but by the end of it, I understood fully what had happened(you'll see what I mean), I actually had to explain to my mum what was this or that. When the first credits appeared and people were getting out of the cinema, everyone had their faces all strange, as if they might be dreaming, that was the exact feeling I had myself. If you've seen matrix and thought it was good, please see this, you'll realize matrix was crap. The acting was pretty good, and I thought Leonardo Di Caprio was really involved in the film. There is some of the typical American idea of love, and I guess that there might be some things that don't really make sense, but apart from that the movie was great. Don't take too little kids, 'cause I guess they might get disappointed, but you can perfectly consider taking kids that are 13 or 14( I know it because I am one).",9,1,5,29 September 2010
