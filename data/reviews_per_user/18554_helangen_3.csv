Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars sabotaged!
","The myth of Star Wars which has been the birth of a lot of Science-Fiction adventures, some good, some not so good now seems to sabotaged by it's inventor, the great George Lucas himself. It would take a long time to explain what could have been done better on 'Episode One' but most is just to obvious to oversee. If you look at some of the breathtaking scenes of 'Star Wars' or 'The Empire Strikes Back' and compare it with the battles and intrigues of 'The Phantom Menace' you've to ask: 'Where did all the people go?' You cannot make a movie which has to represent something like one of the greatest Fantasy Adventures ever with a dozen actors and tons of computer generated imagery. Would there have been no other way to put in a character like Jar Jar Binks than a computer animation? Why the droids? Weren't the Storm Troopers of the three first movies not good enough to fight for the Trade Federation which seems to be technologically far more advanced than the evil galactic empire? In an interview Lucas once said that he wasn't sure about putting in a puppet to play an important character in a movie, now he replaces most the supporting characters in 'Phantom Menace' by not even touchable computer animations. Lucas put it some really great effects in this movie, but they're so great they don't seem believable. Everything is just to big, to fantastic, to nice rendered. The ships of Star Wars always were machines and not living quicksilver drops. And about the cast. It's a good cast but Lucas really neglected them. He did all he could for the effects and the promotion but he ignored the cast, ignored the living people inside his giant video game. Sometimes it seems he didn't even want them to be more realistic than any of the bits and bytes enemy lines. If this should be the future of film making, men like Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor shouldn't cooperate with the force which intends to wipe them out, all of them.",1,0,1,8 August 1999
X-Men," Great film, Bub!
","To be honest I've never read 'X-Men' long enough that it would make me a true X-Men fan. However I was stunned how serious this film brought the comic to life. There also were many quotes and moments that become even better, if you know the comic. I don't think it is a good idea to make movies out of comic books but this time and with one or two Tim Burton movies, too, it worked very well. Anna Paquin, Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are absolute convincing, justifying every modification made on the character. Even ruce Davison was great and let no doubt about the sincerity of his action occur. The only thing that bothered me a little was that - at least in the german dubbed version of the film - small touch of 'arrogant right hand' put onto Cyclops but here, too, I think fans of the comic book now better. Although he always said to be no fan of the comic, Bryan Singer seemed to have made a film full of love for the material making that over the top characters like Magneto or Sabretooth appear serious and true. 'X-Men' stands way above the usual superhero flicks in character and plot development but also doesn't try to look more real through cutting superpowers to a more realistic level. And for the visual expressiveness, seeing someone carrying a tray with glasses of champaign in Wolverine's dream or Professor Xavier graciously standing up from a chair inside Kelly's memories are just two little details of many, where the action movie grows to be art. I surely can't wait to see Beast or Gambit in action but for a sequel it would also be an idea to concentrate more on the characters that are standing on the side line in the first movie like Storm or Cyclops. After all 'X-Men' is a great piece of film, fun to watch and almost flawless in portraying some of the greatest comic heroes of all times and lets recent superhero flicks like 'Batman & Robin' look even more hollow than they already are. I hope, their will be more films like 'X-Men' in the future but I also hope, that Marvel understands that there is a big difference between the movies and the comic books and don't repeat the mistake of letting a film change an already existing comic like they did with 'Blade'.",9,0,0,4 September 2000
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," As fantastic as only a dream can be...
","Yes, shame on me because I'm one of the few who haven't read the book but I'm convinced I'll make it up some day for now I have a good reason to believe it is awesome.I've been a fan of fantasy stories for many years and almost forgot what they could look like. This was probably one of the best times I had in a cinema. As a movie lover I could not think of anything negative to say about Peter Jackson's 'The Fellowship of the Ring'. I simply loved it all along.The reason I write this is that I heard some bad insults about Howard Shore's score and I wanted to state my p.o.v. I'm collecting movie soundtracks now for more than ten years and although there are certainly older people with more experience than me I think I can tell whether or not a score is well done, or at least if it's to be loved.Shore's score is everything I'd expected for a huge fantasy story like 'Lord of the Rings' with all the fine details and the awesome orchestral power to describe the ancient struggle between good and evil. I heard someone say the music was too weak for the images. That person must have slept over the whole movie of never have listened to anything composed by Howard Shore. He pictures just the right atmosphere with his themes for Sauron's nine black riders and lifts the spirits high with a playful tune for the Hobbits. Listening to the CD is as much fun as watching the movie.The way Shore combined his own style with ancient tribal and Celtic sounds superbly added by Enya and haunting orchestral charges of classical adventure should be a sign to everyone like Hans Zimmer who bobs across the lake of mindlessness now for more than half a decade. I am convinced Shore's music for the two episodes yet to come will have the same effect on me and be a living proof why I love movie music so much. My advice is, buy the CD, turn down the light and up the volume and let yourself be taken into a world of magic and adventure, of Elves and Hobbits and get lost in the vast and mysterious realm of Middle Earth.Just a few more words about the great performance of Elijah Wood, Ian Holm, Ian McKellen, Liv Tyler, Christopher Lee, Hugo Weaving, John Rhys Davis and so on. They really proved skilled acting and not just displaying of names like in some dumb Hollywood flick. And as for Elijah Wood who has been a brilliant  actor since `Radio Flyer' and way back, he sure is the best for the job.",9,0,0,3 January 2002
