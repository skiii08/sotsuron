Saturday Night Fever," An OK travolta film
","well, what can i say? it wasn't bad even though i only saw part of the PG version on TV. yet, it wasn't as good as Grease. It reminds me almost of Purple Rain, 8 Mile and Flashdance. Wanna know why? because they all have battles. this and flashdance had a disco battle, 8 mile had a rap battle and purple rain, i don't know what kind. it's about this man, Tony (Travolta) who wants to be a disco king. He falls in luv with this ballet dancer Stephanie but has so many issues at home, his family's broke, despite the fact he looks like a real New Yorker. He also has his womanizing skills. I don't know what happens later. but maybe i'll find out soon..... when i watch the PG version. if ur parents don't want u 2 watch the R rated version.... the next time it's on... watch it. so rent it, watch it, dance once in a while and if you like it, buy. Also watch the sequel even though it's not as good as this.",6,0,1,25 June 2007
Home Alone," the best Culkin film ever seen
","This was the world's best Macaulay Culkin film I've watched. It is one of my most watched films ever watched. Mac did his best in this film and the second. And made billions of bucks. Its about this kid who wishes his parents would disappear then he becomes man of the house and has to deal with these retarded burglars who just are dying to break in. Then he must rid of them forever. If you aren't watching it now, you should. It's really worth watching. So if you don't own it, go rent Home Alone (under Comedy section), enjoy it and if you love it, own it. If you love Home Alone, you'll love Home Alone 2. And his other films. I feel sorry for those who haven't seen it. I know 99% of the world has seen it.",10,0,1,8 May 2007
Dreamgirls," A good semi autobiography
","Ah... the dreamgirls strike again... in film form. Beyonce at her really worst (shoulda got a Razzie), a great debut for Jen Hudson (deserved the Oscar), Jamie Foxx in another semi-autobiography and Eddie Murphy playing the comedian. It's sort of spoof of Supremes only it doesn't have very many funny parts. It's kind of sad but not tear-worthy. I liked the broke Jackson 5. My mom said when we were watching it, that the hair was a wig on the broke Michael Jackson. But there were some tragedies and silly parts. I liked the girl named Magic in the film. I forgot all of the cast but here is what I can remember: Beyonce Knowles Jennifer Hudson Jamie Foxx Eddie MurphySo rent it, watch it and if you love it, own it. If you plan to own it, get the special packaging at Costco (if you are a member). XD",8,0,0,16 May 2007
Cars," the first best Disney film i liked
","OK, I watched it and loved. Unfortunately I got sick watching it in the movies last summer, but eventually that year I got to see it again, rented then I got it for Christmas. Lighting McQueen (Owen Wilson, Starsky and Hutch) is a cocky racecar that lands in Radiator Springs and meets Mater (Larry the Cable Guy, Git-R-Done) and also falls in love with Sally (Bonnie Hunt, Cheaper by the Dozen). Unfortunately he also has to deal with Doc Hudson (Paul Newman, unknown films), who really hates him, but then later realizes that he's a really known racecar and has to deal with a super cocky racecar, Chick Hicks (Michael Keaton, Beetlejuice). It spoofs off of NASCAR actually. I loved the quotes 'Morning, sleeping beauty', 'He did what in his cup?!' and 'McQueen and Sally, parked beneath a tree K-I-S-S-I-N-T'. I would of listed the other quotes, but I don't have time. But anyways, rent it, watch it, laugh and if you love it, own it on DVD. Watch the Mater and Ghostlight. It's really funny XD.",10,0,0,23 May 2007
Shrek the Third," so funny
","this was probably the best i've ever seen. i was least expecting Justin Timberlake. But overall, it was eminent. one of my favorite scenes is when Fiona says: Shrek... I'm -horn blows- Shrek... I'm preg... -horn blows but is snatched by Shrek- and then i liked the scene where Shrek had a million little ogrelettes in a nightmare. I wonder what the Fourth is about. it was most definitely worth seeing.it is still in the movies, so if you can afford it and want to, you can go see it. so if you plan to go to the movies, reserve seats for this one, get popcorn, laugh out loud and if you like it, wait for it on DVD and buy it.",10,10,15,26 June 2007
8 Mile," A great film
","This was a pretty good film. Not a very good location, though. Eminem deserved to have a follow-up to this film. Mekhi did a good job on his co-star role. Thumbs up to Brittany and Kim. Just like Purple Rain, Flashdance and Saturday Night Fever, only with Eminem in it. It shows his past life and is very similar to it. It's about B-Rabbit (Eminem in his debut film) who must live through poverty with his mom, Stephanie (Kim Basinger) and his half-sister Lily (Chloe Green, if I'm not mistaken). His slutty ex, Janeane lies to him that she's pregnant when she really cheated on him. But he has 'Future' (Mekhi Phifer) his best friend and his new girlfriend, Alex (Brittany Murphy). Eminem should have gotten an Oscar for his first film. Not Razzie worthy. It's really worth watching.",8,1,1,9 May 2007
Shrek 2," Another great sequel i luv
","Just like Home Alone 2, I love this sequel. It's kind of like the first, only a few more different people. Shrek (Mike Myers), his new ogre wife, Fiona (Cameron Diaz) and Donkey (Eddie Murphy) return in this quirky sequel. They get an invite from the King (John Cleese) and Queen (Julie Andrews) of Far, Far, Away. They meet the cocky Prince Charming (Rupert Everett) and Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders) who attempt to break up the happy couple because Charming wants Fiona just like Farquad did. They also meet Puss in Boots (Antonio Bandares). It's just family fun. I look forward to Shrek the Third. So if you need a good laugh, rent it, watch it, laugh and if you love it, own it. XD",9,0,1,12 May 2007
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," a good sequel i've seen for the first time
","There aren't very many sequels I've seen but enjoyed. This is probably my most favorite sequel in the world. It's just as good as the first. Mac stars as Kevin again in this super-silly sequel, but lands in NYC. As soon as his family finds out he's missing, they do everything to find him. But he has a blast in NYC. But he uses his dad's credit card and Harry and Marv (from the first) and follow him everywhere he goes. Then he does the same thing in the first, but only at his Uncle Rob's. This is a good sequel. But just don't watch the 3rd. It sucks. This film made more cash than the first. But they're both good no matter what. So if you don't own it, rent it, watch it, enjoy it and if you love it, own it. The more Mac, the merrier.",10,1,1,8 May 2007
Shrek," A good animation film
","This is one of my favorite animated films, even though I like the sequel more. This is based on the book in case you forgot what it was based on. It's about this ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers, Austin Powers) who has to go on this quest with this donkey named Donkey (Eddie Murphy, Nutty Professer) that won't shut up. Then he meets Fiona (Cameron Diaz, There's Something About Mary), who at first dislikes but secretly likes her. But cocky Lord Farquad (John Lithgow, unknown films) wants her all to himself. Will they live happily ever after? I also recommend Shrek 2. It's a comedy-family film. I own it. So rent it, watch it, laugh and if you love it, own it. XD.",9,1,2,12 May 2007
Bruce Almighty," One of Jim Carrey's Best films
","I liked this film a whole lot. I didn't think it was sacrilegious or anything like that. Some people that are Christian might think that, but it isn't. It's about Bruce Nolan (Jim Carrey, Liar Liar) who is an anchorman who's life is going horrible until God (Morgan Freeman, The Shankshaw Redemption) shows up. God gives his powers to Bruce and he impresses Grace Connely (Jennifer Anniston, Picture Perfect), his girlfriend. The funniest scene I liked was when Bruce kept typing things that weren't true and that made Evan Baxter (Steve Carnell, The 40-Year Old Virgin) fart and speak gibberish. So if you are in a comedy mood, rent this, watch it, laugh out loud and if you like it, buy. It's worth it.",9,0,0,25 June 2007
