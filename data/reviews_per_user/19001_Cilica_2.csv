Hereditary," Loved the premise and plot
","I couldn't help myself but I laughed through the whole movie. I did like it but for the horror aspect, I just kept laughing. I think the movie needed a couple more scenes as Annie became hysterical by the end, true she was possessed by the end but she made much sense. Her character could use more development of norm against the horror of who her mother was, and practiced.The worst scene is when she is frantically telling her husband what is happening showing him the photo album. He just ignores her saying she needs help, call the police. Takes away from the plot.All in all I enjoyed it.",8,1,4,15 November 2019
Revolutionary Road," Reality that has my stomach hurting.
","Raw reality of a couple stuck in the cycle that has become the norm for too many people. You cannot afford to dream because the mortgage is due, the children have needs and you just on with it. The interesting challenge here is listening to the 'insane' friend who speaks the true of the stale, boredom the premeditates everyday life. And he is the insane one.Incredible acting, worth every minute and why my stomach hurt - I feel the turmoil, I feel the choices to sacrifice happiness and dreams families make to pay for a life that they are formed to want from childhood by society. A happy life put on a pedestal that one can never reach in the 1950's and often today.Then very ending is priceless at conveying who really lives in their own dreams.",10,0,0,3 July 2019
