The Rock," Bilge
","What an awful collection of clich√©s and bilge this is. The characters (using the term loosely) are hysterical and each in possession of several tics of personality. They don't interact, they merely display their own idiosyncrasies with no reference to anyone else. It really is that bad.Like most American films involving the military, there is virtually no indication of any professionalism at all. People lose tempers, shout, go ballistic for no reason and play the maverick which is either the true state of the American military or the Hollywood take.While Sean Connery is competent here, Nicholas Cage is most deservedly not. Perhaps in an attempt to keep up with Connery's professionalism as an actor, Cage shouts all the time and overacts terribly in every scene the two share. The result is Cage looks like an amateur.Don't bother to watch this.",1,8,22,9 July 2007
Forrest Gump," Schmaltz is the word.
","A fairy tale expression of recent American history. This has Tom Hanks playing a simpleton as the embodiment post-war America and the fact it won Oscars tells us more about American pop-culture than any erudite books might wish to say.Tom Hanks plays Gump, a rather 'slow' boy who grows into a 'slow' man and yet manages to involve himself in major events in American history: racial integration, Vietnam, Watergate and so on, and yet always manages to remain unwittingly on the side of Liberalism.In other words, this rather saccharine and somewhat nauseous film is trying tell us that what is good about America is the simple homespun values of innocence and goodness whilst presumably anyone with an IQ of above average is not to fully trusted. A naive message in the least which to anyone with an IQ over 100 or anyone living in Europe seems the cause of so many problems rather than the solution.If you are looking for a black and white view of the world, an idealistic and simple and sop for conscience view of the world, then this might help.For those with an IQ over 100 I would suggest you go elsewhere.",2,6,15,14 July 2006
Black Hawk Down," A movie of wishes
","Whilst this is an undoubtedly well made film which gets into the heart of battle in the same way the opening to Private Ryan does, it is spoilt only by the insertion of far too many 'gung-ho/emotional' comments from the soldiers themselves. A kind of Oprah Goes To War.The simplistic heavy-handed way in which American forces fight is shown (and the consequences thereof) but despite the way in which the film tries to turn around the mistakes it does leave them in a bad light. The shouting, the poor training, the mistakes and wrong decisions are all displayed.The final credits begin with a display of the name of 19 soldiers killed in the event. It also mentions in passing the 1,000 Somalians who died and it is typical of the film that they are anonymous and far, far less important. Americans are worth more than Africans it seems.",6,2,3,19 March 2006
