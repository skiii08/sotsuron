Hereditary," Amazing , creative dramatic and horror twists
","WIth its beginnning the movie can fool some people but the initial good and shoking drama shows how torn and broken things are , and it only works as fuel for its growing inside us as one kind movie so that only in the right moment its true face shows and makes everything that gone through the movie take its place and sense , the acting is really good and the horror its both of fear and sadness adn nothing i that happened i was expecting totally out of the ordinary eespecially if compared to others from the same genre .",10,1,2,28 August 2018
