Blade Runner 2049," Over long and overwrought
","I'm old enough to remember when the original Blade Runner came out in theatrical release. It wasn't a box office disaster exactly. But it sure wasn't the hit they seemed to be hoping for. Part of the problem was that most people, myself included, just didn't get the whole film noir science fiction thing the first time that we saw it. Shortly after its release, Ridley Scott, the film's director was quoted as saying that the film that was released was not the film that he had intended. That led to a Director's Cut re-release, one of far too many Director's Cut releases that would follow. It wasn't much better than the original. It was just longer. But the movie got better with age and with further viewing. The original Blade Runner might in fact be the last great movie that Ridley Scott made. He went from the man who publicly bucked the system to being the ultimate minion of the system. Scott's movies have become known for their loudness, explosions and car crashes, as full on sacrifices of anything meaningful or deep to the great god of box office blockbusters. So my first question, when a good friend suggested Blade Runner 2049 to top off our mutual birthdays was if Ridley Scott had directed it. Since he hadn't, and since I did love the original, eventually, and since the trailers and interviews with Harrison Ford and Ryan Gosling made it seem like an interesting movie, we headed out to see it. We went whole hog too. 3D and Whatever They Call the Thing with the Chairs that Shake and Shift. (Quick Note: If you happen to have Asperger's, as I do, 3D and Moving Chairs is a horrible idea. It was all I could do to stay in my seat at first and not run screaming from the theatre... I hung in there and did even enjoy it at points, but someone with more severe issues might not be able to handle this at all... Guess I should have thought that one through...) Ridley Scott didn't direct Blade Runner 2049, but he did produce it. And therein may have lied the problem. A man who complained about producers cutting his film down is going to have a hard time deciding to cut another director's work, particularly when the work bears the same name. Blade Runner 2049, with a minimum of 30 minutes, probably closer to 45, cut from it might have been a very good movie. The acting is superb in every single role. The story has many interesting ideas flowing through it. And there's some fine cinematography. But you just can't maintain the kind of tension that this film is trying to create for that long a time. And the so called mystery that the film seems to revolve around just doesn't seem to matter when you spend that much time taking us through a overly long overwrought convoluted investigation. We go from tense to bored and then to a little annoyed that the film isn't being wrapped up. A few jokes, a few lighter scenes might have saved the film too. We can see how much fun Gosling and Ford can have with each other in interviews. Why don't we see that on the screen? Blade Runner 2049 tries hard to recreate that film noir darkness of the original, but it just never quite gets there, and it takes way too long to not quite get there. It doesn't suck. There are many very good things about Blade Runner 2049. It just goes on too long and then doesn't quite deliver whatever it is that we've been waiting too long to see. I can't say that I'd recommend the movie to anyone. But I also can't say that no one should watch this film. If you don't mind overly long movies. If you don't mind convoluted plots that don't quite pay off. And if your ass doesn't get numb from sitting in a seat too long, even a seat that moves, maybe you'll like Blade Runner 2049. Or maybe somebody will finally do a Director's Cut where they cut more from the film than was originally released... Yeah. That's likely to happen.",4,7,15,18 October 2017
Child 44," Almost perfect...
","Let me begin with a confession: As far as I know I am heterosexual, but I have a very non-heterosexual fixation on Tom Hardy. And Idris Elba. And Carey Price. And Benedict Cumberbatch... But most of all, on Tom Hardy, particularly of late. Since I first discovered him... (That's right, I discovered him. At least that's how it works in my mind...) In the film Warrior, which I and a few friends only went to see as a kind of joke. I mean, none of us was expecting a movie around Mixed Martial Arts to actually be any good, and none of us had ever heard of the two leads, Hardy and Joel Edgerton. (Oh, yeah, him too...) So we were expecting it to be awful in that way that you can sarcastically make fun of for years to come. I have an extensive background in boxing and Mixed Martial Arts, so I was expecting to find that amusing and worthy of ridicule as well. (Since then there has been the brilliant television series, Kingdom and the hilarious Here Comes the Boom, so apparently you can make good things around MMA.) We were all particularly shocked by the intense and powerful performance of Tom Hardy. Of course we all assumed he had to be American and must be an experienced Mixed Martial Artist. I had no idea that I had already seen Hardy in RocknRolla and Inception then. Aside from having quickly become one of the finest actors on the planet, Hardy has an ability to physically disappear into roles in a way that we haven't seen since Gary Oldman's early work. Since then I've seen Hardy carry an entire film just driving in a car and talking on the phone in Locke, make you forget that you're watching the same actor playing twins in Legend, give powerhouse performances in films like The Drop, The Revenant and Bronson, audience thrilling performances in The Dark Knight Rises and Mad Max, Fury Road, and most recently give one of the best performances seen in a television series since James Gandolfini, his co-star in The Drop, in the stunningly good British production, Taboo. Hardy, as an actor is quite simply as good as it gets. So I found myself looking for anything else that Hardy has done which I somehow might have missed. And a friend told me about Child 44, which I had never even heard of. The film itself stretches believability a bit with the murder mystery aspect, asking us to buy into the idea that a Stalin era MGB (forerunner of the KGB) agent becomes obsessed with a child serial killer while his life is being torn to bits by the agency that he once worked for. The latter part has been written about extensively by writers like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn. It truly was a kind of inevitability that these 'Blue Hats' would find themselves the subject of the same brutal paranoia and torture which helped them rise to power. Hardy sells the former aspect brilliantly, but even then, it feels a bit thin at times that a man in such an environment would be able to, let alone could become fixated on solving murders in a world where Stalin himself had declared that murder did not exist, that it was a product of corrupt western capitalism. This is a very small, negligible problem with the film because of its brilliant cast, which includes the aforementioned Gary Oldman, Hardy's co-star from The Drop, Noomi Rapace, and Joel Kinnaman, who was so brilliant in the TV series The Killing, as well as films like Suicide Squad, as the villain (Yeah, okay, he's another one...). There is also a wonderful sub textual underpinning of the paranoia of that time and place and how that can lead to a world where nothing is what you think it is. Hardy's lumbering stoic presence is yet one more remarkable physical transformation. As is almost always the case with Hardy, and with so many great British actors, there is never a moment of self indulgence or sentimentality about his character, which is dead on for this particular character. Rapace, who is no stranger to strange European murder mystery, having risen to wide public acclaim in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, is wonderfully guarded and unreadable as Hardy's perhaps not so willing wife. Kinnaman, also having a background in Swedish film, is disturbingly calloused and unfeeling as Hardy's nemesis. And of course there's Gary Oldman, who, like Hardy, seems incapable of giving anything less than great performances. In this film, we see some vintage almost impossibly textured Gary Oldman moments, though his role is only slightly more than a kind of cameo. The rest of the cast is equally superb and the filmmaking is perfectly dark and brooding. That previously mentioned thin premise is almost entirely overpowered by the strength of the whole and is made only a minor blemish on an otherwise very close to perfect canvas. If you love Tom Hardy, even in a non-heterosexual way, you will definitely love this movie. Not quite as much as you may have loved Taboo, Locke, The Drop or Warrior. But probably as much as you loved Bronson or Legend.",9,1,4,9 March 2017
The Princess Bride," Perfection
","The Princess Bride I can honestly say that I've never met anyone who watched The Princess Bride who hasn't loved it. It is by the most quotable non Python, non Bogart film of all time. There are so many quotable moments, so many moments that make you smile even on your worst day, that can still make you laugh out loud after the fiftieth viewing. (Yes, I have easily seen it at least that many times.). I love this movie. I am madly in love with this movie. If you haven't seen it yet, stop reading this and go on Netflix or wherever, and watch it! If you haven't read William Goldman's book yet, read that too! It is so different than the movie and yet equally wonderful that you need to experience both. If you haven't read his script collection, where he tells stories about the making of the book and the film, or Cary Elwes book about the making of the film 'As You Wish', read that too! It still amazes me that I meet people who weren't even alive when this movie was made, who love this film. Okay, I'm sure that there are people who don't love this movie. There may even be people who hate this movie. They're called sociopaths. Not loving The Princess Bride is like not loving a new born Puppy or a Charlie Chaplin silent film. There is something wrong with you if you don't. (Okay, that's probably not true, but I would suggest you see a professional if this movie doesn't make you laugh and tingle all over...). Today is the 30th anniversary of this classic masterpiece and it deserves to be watched at least one more time. Surprisingly, The Princess Bride did not do well when it was released, largely because the studios had no idea how to label it. It is a Fairy Tale Comedy Romcom Action Kids and yet Adult film that took close to 20 years to make precisely because no one could figure out how to make it or what the hell this script was supposed to be. Before it was made it was already a Hollywood legend for that very reason. Goldman, who was known for very serious films like All the President's Men, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and Marathon Man, did know how to label his novel either. The story goes that he started making up a Fairy Tale for his grandchildren, which is precisely how the film leads us into the story. It begins with a young Fred Savage, in bed with a minor illness, who is forced to endure a visit from his absent minded grandfather, played by the wonderful Peter Falk. In the beginning the boy doesn't want to hear the story, especially not if there's going to kissing, and the movie uses this wonderful device of the story being read, and occasionally interrupted, by a grandfather to his grandson. Even fans of this film may not realize just how perfect the casting was until they hear who was originally considered for some of the roles: Arnold Schwarzenegger instead of Andre the Giant for Fezzik, Danny DeVito instead of Wallace Shawn for Vizzini, Christopher Reeve instead of Cary Elwes for Wesley, or Uma Thurman instead of Robin Wright as Buttercup. And that's just mention a few. The dialogue sparkles with sweetness and laugh out loud wit. The casting is dead on perfect, including Billy Crystal as Miracle Max, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya and Christopher Guest as the Six Fingered Count Rugen. And when you consider that Francois Truffault and John Boorman of Deliverance fame wanted to make the film, you realize how perfect Rob Reiner is as the director, and how underestimated he is as a film director, how superb his instinct for casting for chemistry is, particularly in this film. One of the stories that I love to tell over and over again is that Buttercup is described in her first scene by Goldman(Where most screenwriters insert age and basic description, such as mid 20s, Blonde etc.) as 'Not as pretty as she might be, but still the most beautiful girl in the world.'. And when you see Robin Wright in this film, even when you look at her today in House of Cards, you see how perfectly she fits that description. This is one of those rare films where no superlative can do it justice. It is one of those rare films where people can quote each scene almost line for line. It is a communal experience and you either get it, or you just don't. And, as one of those people who hate to join anything, as someone who is addicted to his own scepticism, as someone who detests Romcoms, I can admit that I've bought whole heartedly and unashamedly into The Princess Bride. I fall in love with this film every single time that I watch it. And, on this 30th Anniversary of the film's release I plan on falling in love with it all over again tonight. And as I hit play I will whisper under my breath, perhaps even out loud, and I will get tears in my eyes as Peter Falk turns and says it that final time, 'As you wish.'.",10,0,0,25 September 2017
Get Out," Stay out from Get Out
","Get Out, no really, Get out...So, I went to see the movie Get Out with some friends yesterday. We had a choice between Leggo Batman and Get Out, and we chose Get Out. We're still arguing about who should be blamed for that choice. They list it as a horror. What they don't tell you is that the horror is that someone would even make this movie. I've never seen any of Jordan Peele's movies before this. I will spend the rest of my life trying to avoid ever seeing one of his movies again. The thing strives to be one of those Sixth Sense 'What a twist!' movies, but the so called twists are so obvious, unrealistic and just flat out lame that you find yourself rolling your eyes in the dark and just praying that no more twists are coming. And they always are. If you were to take the racial premise in this movie and reverse it, there would be pickets and riots. But apparently it's perfectly acceptable to have a white people are evil and black people are good movie. Just for the record, I'm only part white. But I'm fully offended by the premise of this movie, not to mention in the clumsy and lazy execution that doesn't bother to try to make its plot points make any sense. To be fair, the trailer to Get Out does hint that this could either be a very good movie or one of the worse that you've ever seen. It comes far close to the latter and is too lazy to ever even approach the former possibility. This movie really does suck. It sucks despite some very good actors, including Catherine Keener, who has been superb in indie films like Your Friends and Neighbors and Bradley Whitford, an Aaron Sorkin favourite. The lead actor Daniel Kaluuya was even in the wonderful British series The Fades and Skins. And yet the net result, the only result is just flat out stupid and predictable. Maybe the title, Get Out, is meant as a warning to any potential audience. But probably not. That would require too much effort and self awareness. But the rest of us can try to help each other out in these days when going to the movies is more expensive in most places than drugs, and gives you far less pleasure. When in comes to Get Out, please, please, for your own stakes... Stay out... Go see Leggo Batman. I haven't seen it. But I wish I had.",1,131,266,3 March 2017
Arrival," Faint yet High Praise
","Arrival I'm a bit late in my review on this film, but, when you consider the theme of time as a non linear force that threads its way through this film, perhaps I'm not actually late at all. I haven't been a very big fan of director Denis Villeneuve's work. Those who know me, know that I love odd and I love weird, but I just can't bring myself to forgive Villeneuve for what I consider to be the silly and unearned metaphor at the ending of Enemy or the long overwrought pointless tension of Prisoners. I just didn't buy into either of those film's premises. I understood what Villeneuve was trying to do in both films. So please stop trying to tell me that I just missed the point. I got the point in both cases. I just thought that the point was stupid. I probably would not have started watching Arrival if I had have known it was directed by Villeneuve. But in this film, Villeneuve seems to take a page out of Terrence Malick's playbook in the way that the story fades in and out of time with a dreamlike quality. And that gives Arrival exactly the right tone for its subject matter. The film, about a translator who is brought in to try to translate the language of aliens who have mysteriously visited the earth in different locations around the earth, falls down in a few places with the logic of its science and the behaviour of some of the characters. And it's not an easy movie. At times its dreamlike quality leaves you struggling to make sense of what exactly is going on or why you should care about what's going on. But in the end Arrival strives to be better than just another visited by aliens movie. It never indulges in easy emotional moments or in treating the audience like we're too stupid to understand it. The cast, including Amy Adams, Jeremy Renner and the very underrated Forest Whitaker, is excellent, and the film makes you stop and think about how we take communication for granted and how difficult it could actually be if aliens were ever to actually pay us a visit to actually communicate with them. It is a very smart and challenging movie. Like much of Malick's work, and like most of Villeneuve's work, it is often flawed and imperfect. Yet Arrival, I think, is better than its flaws, and challenges us in a very interesting way. It's not a movie for everybody. But the fact that it does win over someone like me, who has never liked a Denis Villeneuve film before this, may give you a sense why you might want to watch it. I do recommend Arrival. In fact, I recommend it quite highly. It tries to be better than the usual fare in this genre. And in my opinion in succeeds more than it fails. This may seem like faint praise. But I mean it as very high praise indeed. Arrival is not like any other movie of its ilk that you are likely to see. It may not be for everyone, but it is more than worth the effort and the time to watch it and make up your mind about it yourself. Many of you should see Arrival. Not because it is perfect. But because it is not trying to be every other movie that you've ever seen. There is a famous story about two film critics being overheard as they cam out of a screening of Stanley Kubrick's 2001 when it was first released. One critic is said to have turned to the other and said 'I don't know if I've just seen the greatest movie ever made or if I should be asking for my money back.'. Many movies since have tried to approach the high intelligence of Kubrick's great masterpiece. Arrival comes as close as any I've seen. For me that is the highest praise that I can give it. It's not 2001. But it comes close to being as enigmatic and as thought provoking. If you hated 2001, and many people do, don't go out and see Arrival. If you loved 2001 however, then Arrival may be about as close as you're going to get to a film that matches it. It doesn't quite get there. But the fact that it tries, the fact that it almost gets there, makes it worthy of attention. Not by everyone. But by those of us who want film to be more than mere entertainment. For those of us who like to be challenged and to be made to think, really think. Taken all in all, I think that Arrival is a great film. Don't go to see it if you're expecting anything like the many Star Wars sequels. But do see it if you want more than big explosions and catch phrases from a film. Do see Arrival if want more from a film than for it to be easy and obvious. And I do mean that as very high praise indeed.",9,1,5,16 April 2017
Alien: Covenant," In space, no one can hear you groan...
","Alien: Covenant Alien: Covenant sucks. There, I've just saved you over two hours. You don't even have to read the rest of this, because in the end, that is what have to say. That is all I have to say. Alien: Covenant sucks. It sucks hard. But Alien: Covenant sucks in a very sneaky kind of way. It seems like a pretty good movie, almost like a return to the original movie, for the first 90 minutes or so, and then it falls back on the same stupid premise of Prometheus, the prequel to the original movie. Alien: Covenant is in fact the sequel to a horrible prequel. It ends up relying on one of those M. Night Shamalmawhatshisface 'What a twist!' endings that only a lobotomy would prevent any semi intelligent viewer from seeing coming a mile away, and which the characters would have to be semi morons not to see, and of course they don't. I don't know what happened to Ridley Scott. Maybe he ran out of good ideas. Maybe he got trapped in the Hollywood formula mill. Or maybe he's just collecting paychecks at this point. He used to be a pretty good film maker. The first Alien film is one of the great monster movies of all time. But somewhere along the line he stopped letting the most disturbing parts of his films be what we don't see and started insisting on showing us all the money that he's spending on special effects. Great horror, great drama happens in the mind of its audience. It is hinted at, never fully revealed. In the same way that we were never fully shown Rosemary's Baby or the shark in Jaws, it was the hints of the creature glimpsed in shadows and darkness that made the first Alien great and Scott just doesn't seem to know how to do that anymore, or doesn't want to do that anymore. I don't know why an actor as good as Michael Fassbender insists on being in so many bad movies. I don't know why Ridley Scott keeps trying to make the same bad movie over and over again. And I don't know why I watched this movie all the way through. I really don't. But maybe I can save you from the same mind numbing and annoying fate. Don't watch this movie. Watch any of the first three Aliens again, and be happy that we got those. Because it just got a lot worse after that. I'll say it again. I'll say it as many times as it takes to keep you from suffering the same fate that I did. Because in space, no one can hear you groan. Alien: Covenant sucks. It really really sucks. Just trust me on that.",1,3,6,5 July 2017
