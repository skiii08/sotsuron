Blade Runner 2049," A perfect film
","I can't remember the last film that I've come out of at the end and not wanted to change anything, or think anything could have been better done.Slow, brooding, thoughtful, intense, ambiguous and beautiful.One of the very best.",10,2,12,15 October 2017
Interstellar," Literally the worst film I've ever seen.
","The good: impressive special effects, interesting robot characters.The bad: dodgy science, meandering implausible plot, bad editing and pacing, dubious acting.The ugly: horrific dialogue, incomprehensible character motivation, nonsensical and massively contrived story, plot holes so wide you could push Saturn and its rings through.When one astronaut has to use a bit of paper to explain to another, en route, what a worm hole is -- despite it being their goal for a mission decades in planning -- you know you're in trouble.We wanted to walk out halfway through, and in retrospect wish we had, it only got worse.",1,3,12,13 January 2019
