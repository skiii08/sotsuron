Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Amazing special effects
","The excitement in the theatre was incredible!  What fun cheering and clapping before the movie even started.  'The Phantom Menace' is a very good film.  Enjoyed the pod race, the light saber fight, and the acting. Couldn't stand Jar Jar.  Please Mr. Lucas don't have him in Episode 2.  He is annoying and lessened the enjoyment of watching the film.  And I hope in the next installment that the characters become more detailed and emotional. I missed the warmth of the original 'Star Wars' movie.  Overall a great movie experience.",10,0,0,21 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overall - 3.5 out of 4 stars Wonderful movie!
","I thought the movie was very entertaining and well worth the admission price.  The second time I saw it I liked it a lot more than the first viewing.  Even Jar Jar was more tolerable.Great parts:  All the Darth Maul scenes (great character who should have been used more), Pod Race scene, Awesome special effects, and the Introduction of all the old favorites like R2D2 and C3PO was a treat, and the Soundtrack and Costumes were first rate!Lousy parts:  Jar Jar scenes....well most of them.  He became more tolerable as the movie progressed.  But PLEASE don't bring him back in Episode 2. Without Jar Jar the movie would easily have pulled in 600 million at the box-office.  I'd say 98% of the folks who have seen the film can't stand him.  Even kids think he's annoying!Use R2D2 and C3PO more in Episode 2.  I vote to eliminate Jar Jar from the next one completely.  Anyone else feel that way?Overall...fun movie experience.  Best movie of the summer so far.",10,0,0,22 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Brilliant! Much Much Better than Spiderman...go see it.
","Attack of the Clones is a great film.  The audience was cheering at 5 or 6 times during the movie.  You don't get that kind of reaction from moviegoers except in very rare cases.  Go see it...it's such a fun movie.  Sure the dialogue can be corny, but hey it's Star Wars.  Not 'Casablanca.'  Great action, wonderful story, and a Yoda that kicks butt.  I loved it!",10,0,0,13 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Brilliant!
",By far one of the best films ever made.  After 23 years it still amazes me with it's creativity and originality. George Lucas has created a wonderful world full of characters we come to love and admire.  Bravo!  Let's hope this series continues for decades.,10,0,0,26 May 2000
