Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Overrated
","This must be one of the most overrated movie of all time. I came out of the movie feeling like it was a promotional piece made by George Lucas as an advertisement for his company ILM. The plot is weak, very predictable. Jar Jar binks was unnecessary except at the beginning of the film. All the characters were flat. The emotional climax at the end simply failed to deliver. The whole movie had the distinct feel that it was an overblown motion picture based on a video game. What carried the story was its special effects and the reputation of George Lucas and the excitement of the previous Star Wars trilogy. I give it 3 out of 5 only because the ending sequence compensated for the rest of the movie, somewhat.",Null,0,1,2 May 2000
Dark City," Mildly Disappointed...(mild spoilers)
","I think I had too much expectations when I went to rent this video from all the wonderful reviews I heard. Starting off with the good points, the cinematography was really good. It created a dark and moody atmosphere that was essential for this movie. The special effects were also superb, especially during the dual at the ending. The acting were decent. However, at times, the movie was too dark to make out certain details. And I don't know how many could catch this, but that ending is actually borrowed from Japanese animations. I also found the movie to be too similar to the Matrix. But considering it came out before the Matrix, it was actually the more original of the two. Someone in Hollywood probably saw Dark City and thought that it would make a great action flick. Otherwise, there were just too many similar elements to say they were out of coincidence. This could have been a great movie. But it was spoiled by the Matrix.",Null,0,0,16 June 2000
Gladiator," Great action movie, yet very disconcerting.
","This movie is good and bad at the same time. I came out of the movie with very mixed feelings. To start off with the good points and not repeat what others have said, the battle/arena sequences were very exciting. The script is not original, but there were enough twists and turns to make an otherwise formulaic movie interesting. The acting was also very good. Connie Nielson was just excellent. Joaquine Phoenix was perfect for the part. And Russel Crowe shined through out the film. In short, this is a great action movie. Some might not like the ending, but to me, it was very unexpected and very out of the conventional Hollywood way.However, if you look at the film in terms of its appeal and content, the movie is very disconcerting. I would imagine that most people are attracted to this film by its Roman glory. But imagine 2000 years after the Romans, we still want to be entertained by the spill of blood and excessive violence. We thought of Romans as barbaric and ourselves as enlightened, yet many will flood to this movie to watch people's heads get chopped off. This movie is simply a new trend of Hollywood movies (such as Legend of the Fall, Saving Private Ryan, the Thin Red Line, Braveheart, and the upcoming the Patriot)that is designed to feed off the audience's hunger for violence. This film will do great at the box office, but what does that reflect about our society?",Null,0,0,6 May 2000
Contact," An absolutely marvelous film.
","This is my favorite film of all time. This movie captures my heart so much because it makes me imagine what extraordinary experience will be the defining moment of my life. Imagine your life's goal coming true and you are the only person on the planet who will ever be able to savor that experience. An utterly incredible premise. What also fascinated me so much about this movie was how the concept of intelligent life on other planets never deteriorated to the special effect and explosion extravaganzas that almost always characterized films in this genre. Contact, thanks to the book written by Carl Sagan, was put together thoughtfully and intelligently. I also thought that Jodie Fosters character received a major boost in the movie, which made the plot incredibly complex, enormously deeper than what meets the eye. Many of the internal conflicts of her character were presented in the earlier parts of the movie and you have to pay attention and catch them to understand just how significant each scene was. Then you will appreciate how important Matthew McConnahey's character was. If you passively absorb the movie, you will not get much of it! And if you catch those 'cues,' you will understand why they made the ending like that.Technically, I was totally blown away by the discovery sequence. I was also completely astonished by the entire second half of the film. The physics, the visuals, the editing were so well blended into the fabric of her transportation that I was stunned agasp. This is truly a marvelous movie, full of symbolisms and messages that it was just overwhelming. But, its not for everyone. If you like Armaggedon, Independence Day, Men In Black, and movies like that, you probably won't appreciate the subtlety of this movie.",10,1,3,16 June 2000
