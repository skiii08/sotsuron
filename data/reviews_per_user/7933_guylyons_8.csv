Captain Phillips," Starts well, but dragged on.
","We watched the film, and after 30 minutes, started wondering why this was supposed to be so good. Well it all became a rather boring experience, and keeping our eyes open until the end , became a bit of an ordeal. Sometimes we viewers can be seduced into overpraising ordinary story telling, when the work fails to entertain, having been over hyped up by the media. Far too long, and be sure to have the guts to check out the less positive reviews, before deciding to watch this overlong, and dull production.",6,2,3,1 March 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Disappointed
","I felt the charm of the past films was missing, and the lack of delightful alien like creatures was a pity. Having great action scenes means little, if you forget as soon as you see. The story and script is nothing special, and being honest even 1000 raving reviews wont change my mind. Another missed opportunity after the force awakens. Good story telling is an art, and C G I etc is scant compension.",Null,3,8,27 February 2017
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," Very disappointed in this film, poor script and a complete mess .
","A great pity the simple art of story telling, is neglected. The film looks fantastic, has a great cast, but suffers from a poor script, and some viewers like myself ( 63 and 26) and daughter were more than puzzled as understand what was going on. Give me Maleficent every day of the week over this overrated production. A great pity that so many will have loved it, and no doubt computer screen skills, will kill off ancient story tellers, as the cash keeps flowing in the coffers of these investors of 21st century fantasy tales.",6,2,5,23 February 2017
Lincoln," A must for serious students of American history.
","I watched this advanced work, depicting American history, and it was rather hard to take in. The film cannot be classified as entertaining, unless the viewer seeks perfection. One cannot be too critical, as the effort put into the epic film was substantial, but i did not find it easy viewing. I might have found the experience more rewarding, in the company of serious 19th century law students, University lecturers, and American historians. Sadly i was not. The film of course has fine performances, and it looks good, but i cannot see myself ever watching it again, but have enjoyed other Spielberg work, rather more than once.",6,1,2,27 February 2017
The Witch," A chilling slow burner of a tale.
","This film is not an easy watch, and is complex. The viewers can debate all day what was going on, but it is a genuine horror film, all because the director takes you back to the 17th century, a time where religious beliefs, were the glue that held families together. As the film unfolds the viewer sees what tricks the mind can play on the people living together in the wilderness, as things don't go as planned. This work is far more thought provoking, and chilling than so many so called horror films made for today's younger audiences. Ambitious and creative horror film makers and students should see this film, study it, and see what can be done with a limited budget and less well known actors.",8,1,2,27 February 2017
Steve Jobs," How to make what should be of interest a complete bore of a film.
","We all know what an Apple is, and a little about the Apple corporation.When my wife and myself hired the film to enjoy on pay per view, we fell asleep. I urge every viewer of this production to throw rotten fruit, vegetables, and the kitchen sink at the makers of this film. The viewer might as well research on Google for information on Steve Jobs, and if he were alive he might suggest that the makers apply for a job in film making. What a disappointment this piece of work was, and by the end you could not care less, about any of the characters. This was not entertaining fare, and don't pay for the journey, unless you hire a sleeping berth.",6,0,0,23 February 2017
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," A franchise extended, by removing its charm.
","I as a 63 year old big kid, loved Star Wars. What made the first 6 films enjoyable, were the wide ranging array of Alien like creatures. Somehow the makers of this film decided to omit all of them bar one. Why on earth remove the charm of these past films, and include a poor effort of a Darth Vader . The script was a major disappointment, and the inclusion of the primary original characters failed to inspire. The film needed a good story teller, with the humour of past works included. What a let down this was, and i am wary of the next instalment. Up dated special effects, were not enough to keep me happy.",6,9,20,27 February 2017
Spectre," Where was the story?
","When i was a kid of 10, i saw my favourite Bond film, From Russia with love. A proper story, scary villains, and oh yes SPECTRE. Decent believable special effects, no C I G nonsense, and a darned good snappy script. This over hyped over budgeted effort, was a very disappointing production. I have watched it twice, and give it a big thumbs down, it fails in just about every way possible, the story was bad, script worse, action scenes ridiculous, and Spectre info was non existent. What a waste of Waltz, as he could have done with an 18th century composer, to aid his performance. Avoid this, poor daddy trying to tell his kids what the heck is going on, is challenging to say the least.",5,2,4,27 February 2017
