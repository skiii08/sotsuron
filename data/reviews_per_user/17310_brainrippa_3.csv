The Blair Witch Project," Unexpressable in words!
","Every year, there are one or two movies which I fall in love with, but in 1999 there was nothing like this until the end of November when BWP was released in Germany. This is definitely a masterpiece! It's fantastic, innovative and thrilling to the bone. The ending is one of the best ever. I was sitting in a nearly full theater and all the time there were jokes and comments on the film, but at the end you could hear a needle fall on the floor, it was total silence. Can't wait until it's available on video. 9.5/10",10,1,2,18 March 2000
Mission: Impossible II," I wanted it to be better
","This one didn't just lower my expectations on Mission: Impossible, it also lowered my expectations on John Woo. What did he need a $100 million + budget for? For some usual shootings and car chases? Well, the final 20 minutes are what you're waiting for: a brilliant motorcycle race that leaves you breathless. But everything before is nothing compared to other Woo masterpieces. Just two words: Thandie Newton. Her character is the most annoying I've ever seen. The way she looks simply creeps me out. Her scenes with Tom Cruise don't work! But I thought everything Cruise did was unconsciously funny! This is not Ethan Hunt anymore, this is just an exchangeable action figure. The final fight is like Bud Spencer vs. Terence Hill. How many kicks, punches, hits can a normal person take? Yeah, these are no normal persons, but I just laughed about it. Maybe I expected too much, maybe I was too much in de Palmas mission, but I was disappointed and the only thing to do is hoping for Woo's next try, he's still the god of action movies. 4/10",Null,0,0,12 July 2000
Gladiator," Not a Spartacus for the new millennium
","I was really looking forward to see this one, everybody said it was great, critically acclaimed and a place in the Top 250 must be something special. But this was not what I expected. This is nothing else than your average Death Wish - one man goes for revenge flick, only difference is that it's set in the roman empire. Why do we have to see the same story over and over again? Where are new, fresh ideas? Yeah, you don't see a $ 100 million movie for intellectual advance, but this is Ridley Scott! Remarkable is the physical presence of Russell Crowe. Since his cool-as-hell performance in `The Quick and the Dead' he was the man for the important roles, and here he shows that he's able to carry a whole movie. A truly breathtaking performance, he's the man right now!Good action scenes and SFX, amazing sets and great acting are not enough to distract from the weak plot, but makes at least a typical popcorn movie, and isn't that what most movies are all about? 6/10",6,0,0,30 June 2000
