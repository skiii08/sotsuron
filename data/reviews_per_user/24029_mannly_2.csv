It," Flawless Remake
","If you rewatch the original with Tim Curry he is the only decent actor in it. I found it genuinely freaky when I was young, but now the original is laughable. This is a genuinely freaky film on every level, and is tense throughout with completely believable and wonderful performances bar none. If more the haters who review badly for shoddy reasons... There are some awful horror movies of recent years, but this is a complete standout. This and the recent Evil Dead are the only modern remakes that genuinely outweighs the original and prove that sometimes updating does work. Carrie & The Omen should have been left alone.",10,0,1,15 August 2018
Annihilation," Acid trip meets nature
","I know it has divided opinion, but this is a cerebular horror that is astonishingly beautiful in places. Well worth the visuals and the pondering in my eyes. Get how it irritates people though.",8,0,2,27 August 2018
