10 Cloverfield Lane," One of the best you'll ever see
",This is one of the best movies I've seen all year. It's one of those thrillers that pull you in and never let's go. The concept of spending most of it's inside the bunker for the majority of the film was handled perfectly and you just keep wondering is what's out the bunker worse than what's inside? The cast was great Mary Elizabeth Winstead was a great choice for a female lead and played her role perfectly as well as John Gallagher Jr but it's John Goodman that stole the show for me as he seem like this great guy who may know what's going but just maybe crazy as well. I really enjoyed this and so far the best movie I've seen that has been released this year so far.My rating 10/10﻿,10,6,12,9 May 2016
Lucy," 100% percent entertaining
","Here's another real odd ball that I watched this past week. It stars Scarlett Johansen and that is of course all I needed to wanna watch this movie. Lucy is about this women who is kidnapped by this group of thugs and then gets a powerful drug put inside her that unlocks the full 100% of her brain and now she's super smart and seems to have the powers of Jedi. This movie is just really weird and not quite what I was expecting. This is of course an action film. It's got all clichés that were use to. Then becomes a super hero movie and then a beautiful visual ride. It's really confusing a bit at times and it gets worse in the end. The issue I have with Lucy is that she's the only super powered person in this film and there's no one in this that ever becomes powerful enough to give a really cool final final fight in the end, but a weird and visual like dream of a world kinda ending. It's not great and I highly doubt someone would become super hero or a jedi if we used 100% percent of our brain. It's entertaining if you don't look much into it and it's got Scarlett Johansen as a sexy bad ass chick with guns and Morgan Freeman Teaching science",6,6,10,30 March 2016
Easy A," Decent Morden high school movie
","Yes I know this movie is like 5 years but a lot of older movies have newer reviews so why not. The movie follows a high school student Olive (Emma Stone) a she uses the rumor mill to advance her high school life but soon things aren't good as they seem.Now the movie isn't laugh out loud funny or really goofy like most movies of it's kind but there is some jokes and scenes that will have you laughing on the floor though. But also most it's kind, it's got a really good story to it that keeps you watching and a even a lesson learned in the end. Now there's some typical high school movie clichés here in there but that's to be expected because of the movies theme and tone. The performances are great everyone did their best especially Emma Stone she's outstanding in the role as Olive. The soundtrack is there's a lot catchy tunes in there you could say even a cover Joan Jett's Bad Reputation. So it's worth checking out if you're into high school movies.",7,0,0,2 December 2015
