The Monuments Men," A real let down
",This is not a movie I would watch again. After reading the book this is a very disappointment. I believe if this movie was done by the British it would have turned out better and with more realistic acting. Clooney was too stiff in this movie.When compared to the book this movie did not flow well. It seemed to be slow moving and not at all interesting as I was led to believe it would be. Here was a chance to reproduce a bit of history that many people were and are unaware of in an interesting way but it did not turn out as good as it could have.The movie just did not hold my interest well. Maybe if I had not read the book first I would feel differently but I do not think it would make any improvement in the way I feel about this movie.,1,0,0,1 August 2014
