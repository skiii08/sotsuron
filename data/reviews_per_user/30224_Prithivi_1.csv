Resident Evil: Afterlife," All the B-movie ridiculousness of the games, none of the fun.
","Resident Evil: Afterlife makes a valiant attempt to blend elements of the previous films and the video games upon which the series is based, but the end result is a lurching, utterly brainless product that is unlikely to satisfy much of anyone.The plot, such as it is, follows Alice (Milla Jovovich) and her continuing attempts to reach other survivors of the zombie apocalypse while fighting off the evil Umbrella Corporation, which has not given up on experimenting with the T-Virus despite its proved zombifying, world-destroying properties. Along the way she runs into old friend Claire Redfield (Ali Larter), a multiethnic – and therefore mostly doomed – group of survivors (including Chris Redfield, played by Wentworth Miller), and superpowered Umbrella Corp chairman Albert Wesker (Shawn Roberts, who at least appears to be having fun in his supremely hammy role). At this point, I'm fairly sure that the minds behind the Resident Evil films have just given up. The film jumps erratically from slo-mo fight scene to slow-mo fight scene, seldom deigning to exposit or flesh out its characters; several seemingly important plot points are introduced and then never mentioned again. The film attempts to throw game fans a bone with the inclusion of Wesker and the Redfield siblings, but none of these characters are given any significant development or purpose other than to facilitate even more slo-mo fight scenes; viewers unfamiliar with the game series are likely to be confused about why these characters are in the film at all. The only real praise I can give this film is that it's occasionally entertainingly terrible (keep an eye out for digging, swimming zombies!) instead of just boring-terrible like Apocalypse and Extinction.Still: If you're a fan of action-horror films, check out Predators when it comes out on DVD. If you're a fan of the games, wait for Resident Evil 6. If you're a fan of kick-ass women in movies, rent Salt. Afterlife is a soulless, headache-inducing product without enough brains to satisfy the most desperate zombie.",3,6,15,21 September 2010
