The Young Victoria," Above expectations but has its flaws
","I watched this film as I had very little if not no knowledge about Victoria´s life and personality.
During the first half, I was quite impressed with the performances by Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend, slightly more by the latter as I had seen him in completely different roles and really did not expect him here.
During the second half. Rupert Friend made the film from my perspective as we see a loving and sensitive Prince Albert while Victoria seems to be angry and impulsive. Maybe was she but I must admit that, overall, I did not like Victoria.
I was also surprised to see that it is directed by Jean-Marc Vallée that I really appreciated for ´Demolition´, ´Big Little Lies´ and ´Wild´. There are very good moments in his direction, with some fadings to show the intimisy between Victoria and Albert.
As I am not an historian, I can only trust the accuracy of the events but for spending a lot of time in the museums, I can salute the set and the costumes.
I am rating it 7 as I wasn´t completely convinced with the performance by Emily Blunt that did not really make me like Victoria. But maybe was she not that likeable.",7,0,0,8 May 2020
Ghost," A ghost that will never die
","I watched it back when it was first aired and I am very surprised that it has gained in popularity , maybe due to Patrick Swayze sudden death...
The film is about the tragedy of losing someone who was ´too young to die´ and of how to overcome it. Whoopy Goldberg is here to put a smile on our faces, and her duet with Patrick Swayze is hilarious. Surprisingly, I found more chemistry between these too, than between Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore. I appreciated that this film is showing the bright and the dark side of each character. To be watched in remembrance of the talentive yet too ignored Patrick Swayze.",7,5,5,15 May 2019
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Love, Actually, but the American way
","For those who have already watched ´Love, actually´, it is the same idea, only the American way. We are following several ´love´ stories in parallel that in the end are linked. It is just as refreshing, with a great cast, and a good sense of humor (not cumbersome as in so many American comedies).
For those who did not see ´Love, actually´, this film is about the different forms of love: the one for a lover, a friend, a relative, and so on. And of the difficulty of finding the perfect match, for the romantic ones. It is probably for an audience from 15 to 50 year old as to better identify to the characters.",8,1,2,16 September 2018
The Notebook," About 30 minutes too long
","Sorry for not being romantic on that one.
If I did appreciate (yet not enjoy) the first hour, then during the second hour, I kept on having a look at my watch.
I am sure that very romantic people will enjoy it but, apart from the set and the acting that are rather convincing, the story in itself is rather boring. I think one hour and thirty minutes would have been enough.
I am rating it 7 as it is technically good but it is just not quite for me.",7,0,0,26 June 2020
The Irishman," Slow and confusing title
","Sorry for being pragmatic but, why Robert De Niro, the typical American actor, to play the Irish man? Then, why 3 hours? I hadn´t seen that length since Titanic, which I could appreciate as there was action all the way through , but not here. I was attracted by the first scenes where I could see again some ageing actors and well-known director, but here is the problem: the same actors are supposed to play 30 years younger, except that they don´t look more than a couple of years younger, at best. Then, because the cast is ageing, all the ´action´ is slow. It may be fine for an ageing audience who will be happy to see their ageing stars but I am not this old yet. I am not rating this as I am not planning on watching it until the end, life is too short. No offence to the actors and the director which I appreciated elsewhere, but not here.PS: Mr. De Niro, could you please stop doing this gimmick face that you caught on Taxi Driver? It was interesting back then but, time has passed.",Null,4,9,8 December 2019
Zodiac," Above average but could have been better
","I am rating this film 7/10 as opposed to other David Fincher´s who thrilled me more (like Fight Club or Panic Room).
Zodiac has some lengths but probably made to reflect how long it really took to solve the enigma of the Zodiac. Therefore, it is not as dynamic as other David Fincher´s but it remains a very good film worth watching.",7,0,0,15 July 2018
The Terminator," Inspired a generation
","This action film contains few dialogues and most scenes are about TerminatorÂ´s woman hunt. Its success is mainly due to the fact that the original idea was coming at the time when machines started replacing human being in some jobs and other everyday life activities. Although James Cameron deserves his reputation, it is to be noted that there is a huge inconsistency as for John Connors paternity. Also, as it is about technology, I am not sure that the then new technologies will still speak to the new generations.",7,1,1,2 June 2018
Begin Again," Yeah...no!
","When I saw the rating here, I thought ´must be a good film´. Keira Knightley and Mark Ruffalo are recognized as good actors so I went for it. I had some doubts when I saw the name of James Corben as I read the critics from ´Cats´ saying ´James Corden is terrible, as always´ but having never seen him in anything, I couldn´t tell if it was justified.
The opening scene is interesting as I discovered that Keira Knightley could sing. It may not be her main skill but she can (the cast from ´La la land´ would have a lot to learn from her).
The songs are pleasant but as there are the songs of the films and the music of the film, it is a lot of music that is at times a bit loud and too present, and tends to overlap the story.
The story, let´s admit it, is rather basic, but given the reputation of the two main actors, there would have been room to develop.
I don´t know Adam Levine. He is doing the job but his role is not of much interest.
What is really spoiling the film is that Mark Ruffalo is most of the time making a fool of himself, overplaying the role of the ´misunderstood-tortured´ music producer. I have seen him in many films before so I know that he can be good. It is not that he is bad, it is just that he is doing too much.
As for James Corden...so he is an actor?I am rating it 5 as there is much worse, but there is also much better.",5,0,0,30 March 2020
Shutter Island," To be watched at least twice
","I am far from being a fan of Martin Scorsese or Leonardo DiCaprio but after ´Gangs Of New York´, this is the second time that I am enjoying one of their films.
I was surprised with the high ratings at first as it reminded me of ´Insomnia´ for the hallucinations and ´The Others´ for the final twist but there are actually different twists and the scenario is playing with our brains, mislieading us each time we think we know what is happening. For this reason, I think it is necessary to watch it twice to understand the final outcome.
Some seem to have been disappointed with the final twist as it could actually be easily guessed but I don´t think anyone could actually do so. And as it is based on a book, unless this part has been changed, the book would be the one to blame, not the film.
As I wished there were more films like this, I am giving it a 10.",10,0,0,5 May 2020
Lost in Translation," A beautiful story
","I have always been fascinated by Japanese culture so I may not be completely objective.
This is the story of two people who are forced to spend a couple of weeks in a country whose culture and language are estranged to them.
As they are both into relationships that are on the verge to break for lack of communication, they find each other to spend a bit of time and fill-in the emptiness that they feel.
It is slow-paced, with not much music and few dialogues and yet, it is never boring. Probably thanks to Sofia Coppola´s direction that is full of humour and distance to show the cultural differences between the US and Japan. But this is only happening because Bill Murray and Scarlett Johannson are delivering the right performance: they have a great chemistry, a great sensitivity, and they are simply great together.
It is not a big film, it is only a great one that I strongly recommend. As per what I said above, maybe keep it for a day when you feel relaxed so you can appreciate the ambiance of the film.",8,1,1,27 January 2020
Notting Hill," So it´s romantic...
","It may not be the film of the decade but it has all the ingredients of the typical English romantic comedy. There is the English sense of humor, two actors well-known for playing in romantic films, a writer who mainly delivers romantic comedies. If you are romantic, you can only fall in love with it. If you are not, it should at least wake up your romantic side. It is not the best romantic comedy (I prefer ´Love Actually´, from the same writer) but the main actors are lovely together. A plus is that you can hear both English and American accents, which is always interesting.",7,2,4,30 April 2019
Léon: The Professional," The film that revealed Natalie Portman
",The chemistry between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman is absolutely perfect. The young Natalie Portman is the revelation in this dark film that is somehow beautiful and realistic. One of my Luc Besson favorites.,8,1,1,3 June 2018
Shrek Forever After," Too many Shreks
","I must agree with overall critics: why so many Shreks?
The first was original, fun, funny, with plenty of references for adults to enjoy and explain to their kids. The second one was more epic, with too much music and too many short scenes to my taste but still in the spirit. I did not get to look at Shrek the Third as it is not on Netflix so I jumped to this one and from the very first minute, what comes to my mind is ´why?´. The ambiance is somewhat different, less light I would say, with some cumbersome jokes and, the saddest part, while Shrek used to be harsh as he is an Ogre yet showing a softer side at times, he is now mellow, with a great loss of charisma.
All is not negative. It is still entertaining for the whole family but the spark of the two first episodes is gone. Watch it if you have the time but if you have other things to do, skip.",6,0,0,8 March 2020

Gone Girl," Sorry David, I´m bored
","I was really motivated to watch this film as I had heard of it in a good way. I hadn´t done so until now as I don´t particularly like Ben Affleck but I thought I would give him a chance.
I was very positively surprised.to see David Fincher at the direction as I haven´t read the book and trusted that he could only direct a story that is worth it...
It´s been half an hour and, in spite of all the visual that David Fincher is known for, I am really bored.
There are two sex scenes that kind of shocked me as I did not see what they were bringing to the story, but I thought that maybe it was to lead to something so I put these aside and carried on watching.
Then came my second reservation: the over use of the flash back. I don´t get the purpose of having so many, at least at this point of the story as it is so far easy to follow.
Then came the third one: the action is really slow. Yes, there is a music in the background to bring a bit of mystery but it is not working. And I believe the reason is that the story is just not interesting..
I usually appreciate the dark ambiance that David Fincher puts into his films but there has to be a consistent plot.
I am rating it 4 for David Fincher´s work but the script is just not good. And I am yet to find a film in which I will appreciate Ben Affleck...",2,0,0,9 May 2020
A Quiet Place," Let´s be blind to the none sense
","My first problem with this film is that it doesn´t set how sensitive the aliens are to the noise. As everything makes noise (breathing, heart beating), if they can hear ultra sounds, this family should never have survived. But let´s say that in that case, there would be no film.
Moving to the first scene where the kid is getting killed because he is playing with his toy, why are the parents walking so far ahead of him, apart so we can see the action of the father running to him?
Then they arrive at a fountain so loud that we are explained that they can speak as they are covered by the noise. So the aliens are not sensitive to all noises, only the loudest one. So why not being loud all the time from different places so the aliens don´t know where to attack first?
Finally, I understand that the lead actors are the glamour hollywood couple of the moment and we are all very happy for them and to see them in a fake family with a child bearing but why did they decide to have another child in this impossible world?
These are the absurdities I took notes of during the first 40 minutes but it goes on.
The reason why I am still rating it 5 is because the script is original, the acting is technically good and the direction keeping the action ongoing.
If you put aside the none sense of most scenes, you may enjoy it. If like me you expected the story to be consistent with the plot, you may be disappointed.",5,0,0,4 May 2020
Back to the Future Part III," Last for the road
","Although of very good quality, there are some aspects that I liked slightly less than in part 1 and 2.
I did enjoy the fact that it is set in the Far West, with really great costumes, but I found the action a bit more slow to start and some length in the end.
Marty is becoming much more adult and wary about the mission to change the future, while Doc is becoming more human and less of a crazy scientist. I partially appreciated that but not fully.
The great aspect is that there is still a lot of energy, the plot is consistant and the end is giving all its sense to the story.
I believe I have watched the 3 parts the same amount of time, a number that is now an uncountable, but I cannot adjudicate which I like more and less as they all have their qualities and flaws.
An excellent trilogy that I discovered as a child and remains my main reference to these days.",9,2,2,27 April 2020
Shrek 2," The faults of most sequels
","Like in many sequels, we are losing the originality of the first film and it is being replaced by more action.
I had watched both back when they were aired and I am watching them again in a row on Netflix, i.e., as I finished the first, I watched the second one. The element that stroke me the most is the presence of the music in the first minutes. I love the songs but it is a bit too many and meanwhile, there arenÂ´t that many dialogues or funny moments.
I think the point of this is to show that this episode will be less about the characters to which we have already been introduced to in the first episode and to be more in the action. So here it depends on your expectations. I was looking for a funny relaxing program, unfortunately, it is more dynamic than I needed. The story is fast-paced, there are different plots and different scenes that at times, I find a bit hard to follow.
Also, in terms of story, I enjoyed more seeing an ogre fall in love with a Princess than the difficulties of all serious relationship.
This being said, it is still of very good quality.",7,0,0,7 March 2020

La La Land," Off key
","I am not sure of being the best critic as I did not watch it beyond the first minute (reason why I am not rating it) but I would like to say why.
I had tried to watch ´Mamma Mia´ when it was aired and, although I like Abba and Meryl Streep, I hadn´t felt it´. I had understood the intent of celebrating Abba and trying to make a modern musical but I couldn´t feel any ´soul´.
I then took a chance on La la land... I was really motivated to watch a musical again except that the first song is completely off key and as it is not even off key in a funny way, I could not stand listening further than the first minutes. If you have never watched any musical or never heard someone sing ´on key´ before, it may be for you.",Null,0,0,6 October 2018
Groundhog Day," A reference
","So it is predictable that the arrogant Bill Murray and the enthousiastic Andie McDowell will end together. So it is true that, in the end, there is no explanation of why the main character is in the situation he is in. But, the original idea is a very original one and, as far as I remember (and I have seen it many, many times), there are no flaws, which, considering the nature of the plot, would have been easy to make. All the actors are clearly enjoying their role and have a good chemistry. I´m ´only´ rating it 7 as I always regretted not having an explanation for why the main character is reliving the same day, but, apart from this, it is the perfect romantic comedy for all the family.",7,3,4,19 September 2019
Pretty Woman," Hardly believable, and so we believe it
","At the time that it was aired, it was extremely refreshing, and far from the love story you would expect.
The new generations should still be able to appreciate the perfect chemistry between the two main actors, and the secondary roles that are all perfectly in their roles, contributing to remind us the social gap of the love story that everyone can see coming and is looking forward to.
I think that the main reason why it is working is that neither of the main character really belongs to the world they live in.
Contrary to some romantic comedies, this one is far from being condescending so even the least romantic should fall in love with both characters.",8,1,1,14 November 2018
Pulp Fiction," Has had it time
",I used to be a great fan of Quentin Tarantino but I never really liked this one. I think its success is due to the way the scenes are put together and the number of celebrities. But I never found this film THAT interesting. I believe the target is more teenagers or young adults.,5,0,0,5 June 2018
Titanic," Overrated
","Should I dare being hard on this film that is now a reference? I dare.
Honestly, we know the end from the beginning and it is basically about people on a boat. It has become successful because of all the commercial aspects that surrounded it even before it was released and because the audience felt empathy for the tragedy. There is obviously a love story and a bit of humour to make you cry in the end. As I watched it as a teenager, I of course fell in love with Leonardo Di Caprio but couldn´t help but notice that the reason why his character doesn´t survive is because there, supposedly, isn´t enough room on one of the wooden plates that is left of the boat. I beg to differ, there was. But the love story couldn´t end well, it just wouldn´t have made us cry enough.",7,2,3,6 October 2018
Scream 2," An acceptable sequel
","While Scream was rather targetting a teenage audience, this one clearly is. It is more satiric, lighter, and overall funnier than scary. While the end of the first one was rather believable, this one is far-fetched, which is probably voluntary. Teenagers should have a good time around a beer and a pizza.",7,6,6,9 November 2018
Stranger Than Fiction," Between fiction and reality
","This film is so original, it is hard to talk about it without giving spoilers. So let´s just say that it is a story about a story. If you are not finding this helpful, just watch, you won´t regret it.
Will Ferrell is incredibly touching in this sensitve, dramatic yet funny role. Maggie Gyllenhall (I apologize for any misspelling) is great as a love interest. Emma Thompson is excellent, as always. Dustin Hoffman and Queen Latifa are also doing a great job.
I was about to rate it 9 as perfection doesn´t exist but as I cannot think of any flaw, I rate it 10.",10,1,2,13 May 2019
Wonder Woman," Marketing product
","From the first scenes, we can see that a lot of money has been put in it. The scenes of fight are unrealistic, placed in an imaginary world, with expansive costumes. Besides the action that doesn´t make much sense as it is a lot of music and minimalist dialogues to explain the story, there is the acting that is pratically inexistant. I know that Robin Wright can act as I have seen her do a great job before. I cannot really judge here as she has a small part but she is ok (not great though). I have never seen the other actors in anything before so I cannot tell if it is the script, the direction that is making each scene so flat and predictable.
There are attempts of humoristic and romantic moments to give some depth to the story and the characters but it just doesn´t take.
I was often thinking of Captain America as it is also supposed to be set during the World War but it is not even close to having its charm. I immediately felt compation for Captain America and liked his relationship with Agent Carter. Here, I don´t even like Wonder Woman. No offence to the actress as I have never seen her in anything else. As for her love interest...I just don´t care. Again, no offence to the actor but it is too predictable that they will end together without really knowing why as none of the characters is of much interest.
I´m under the impression that it is one of these DC adaptions that is trying to bring people to the theatres except that they forgot the key element for any film: a soul.
It is watchable as long as you don´t pay attention to the many inconsistancies that I will not list here as it would take too long, even longer than the film.",1,5,10,18 January 2020
Back to the Future Part II," Future past
","After having tried to make the future of his parents better, Marty is now trying to make his better. We see him 30 years later, in 2015, just feeling as uneasy with the new technology as he was with the lack of it in 1955.
If the first part is much about exploring the possibilities of the new technology, with not much story, the second part is more complexe, with many twists.
As it was first aired when I was a child, I had difficulties following the second part as it is jumping between the present, past, future and parallele stories set in time. But after several viewing and getting older, I finally appreciated it just as much as the first part that is more linear.
I did not like the fact that Marty is now seeking revenge and becomes more aggressive than in the first part but it is probably due to the fact that the character is no longer a teenager but building his personnality through the time travel experience.
I wish we had seen more of Jennifer as the beginning suggests that she will get more involved but I guess Robert Zemekis didn´t want to add too much to the already complexe plot.
Inspite of my criticism, I am rating it 10 as I am not sure that my expectations would have made this film better. And for having watched it a zillion of times, I can tell that, apart from some goof that some hawk eyes may notice, it is flawless, which is a difficult exercise given the materials.",10,1,1,27 April 2020
Marriage Story," Moving
","I watched it before it was talked about for the Oscars and got into it immediately. One of the first monologues by Scarlett Johannson was so moving that I put Netflix on full screen It also left me very tired as it is breath taking.
I don´t believe I have ever seen Adam Driver in anything before but he is just as good. The characters don´t look pretty either physically or in their mentality, they are who they are, and spend 2 hours giving an idea of what it looks like to go through divorce.
It sometimes reminded me of ´Kramer vs Kramer´ for the topic except that it explores the emotions of both parties equally.
I am not sure I would recommend watching it in couple, or if you are looking for something ´fun´, although there are some humoristic moments.
Last words to Laura Dern and the other actors who are all excellent, but probably slightly shadowed by the 2 main actors who are really capturing the screen.",9,4,6,12 December 2019
Shrek," A charming unconventional Cinderella Story
","For those who still wouldn´t have seen or heard of it (if there are still such people), although kids will be able to enjoy it as well, due to its multiple references to other characters from fairy tales, it is much more for adults . What makes it so funny and charming is that the story is told like a fairy tale except that the situations are much closer to reality. A bit like in Pretty Woman where ´Cinderella´ is actually a prostitute, here, the ´Prince Charming´ is an ogre. There is a character called ´Prince Charming´ but he reveals himself to being arrogant while the ogre becomes more sensitive as the story goes on. Also, although the Princess appears at first as a beautiful naïve woman waiting for Prince Charming, she happens to be a woman of character. To be added to the list of fun parts, the Monkey that is irresistible, and the sound track that is contemporaneous. I seldom rate comedies above 8 as humour is a difficult matter that doesn´t always meets expectations through the film but as it did, I am giving a 9.",9,0,0,22 February 2020
Elizabeth: The Golden Age," A bit too ´sentionalist´ to my taste
","To start with the positive, I found the costumes and set amazing. I guess a lot of research has been done as it matches what I recall having seen in museums. The photography and visual are really good, creating the dark ambiance of the times. However, on the latter, I find that it tends to go too much into describing the tortures inflected at the time as well as the misery. I found it realistic at first but it is many scenes with big zooms that seem to want to repulse the viewer to create some kind of sensationalism.
As I am not an historian, I cannot comment on the accuracy (many other reviewers here seem to have done the job already) but the aspect that I am in contempt with is the fact that I don´t manage to get into the story. The acting and the plots may be in line with the reality but I do not believe in the characters. A few scenes seem a bit ´made in Hollywood´, which is odd for a film about English history. By the way, why having chosen an Australian actress for the part?
My overall impression is that, as per the title of my review, this film was made to ´impress´ but not to reflect a part of history. As I am writing, there is one hour left to this film but I don´t really find any interest in watching further.
A great visual but that´s it.",4,0,0,21 May 2020
The Sixth Sense," Much ado about the twist

To be watched for the general knowledge as it is now cult.",7,1,1,2 June 2018
The Truman Show," CCTV
","Don´t get paranoid but you will never see the world the same way after having watched this film. I had found it very original and clever back in the days, but now that CCTV and the internet are everywhere, it is the reflect of our world, with many true-fake news, cameras capturing our whereabouts all day long, keeping records of our every minutes activities. In modern technology, there is the GDPR, cookies, websites and scams that we are being taught to analyse to protect us.
The Truman show is about a person who thinks that his perfect life is what it is, until he starts noticing details that makes him wonder what and who he can actually trust.
The reason why this film is a family show is because it is not all dark. The ´bad people´ are just human beings with not only good intentions, and there are also good people, as in real life.
I would like to add the note that I didn´t like Jim Carrey before this film as he was always overacting. But here, he showed a talent that much of the audience had never suspected.",8,1,1,14 December 2019
Back to the Future," My absolute reference
","It is about a teenager who is mistakenly travelling 30 years in the past, It brings him to discover the places and the people that he know but in the context of the 1950´s. And the ´time difference´ happens to bring some challenges as to ´how to go back to the future´ ?
The idea may seem simple but the problem with the time is that it is easy to create anachronisms or inconsistencies with the present. But this film is flawless on this aspect. It also introduces us to characters we are happy to follow through time.

Sully," Fair
","It is not the greatest film ever, but it is good. I appreciate the fact that Clint Eastwood sticks to the facts and keeps the scenery sober and never gets melodramatic as so many American films can be. Tom Hanks is playing a hero that doesn´t mean to be one. His performance is perfect, not trying to be an Oscar winner, only playing the character. It is not trying to be as captivating as other melodramatic films. However, the scene when the plane is landing in the water and the after credits when we see the actual crew and passengers made me nearly teary. A great Eastwood.",7,0,0,29 July 2019
Valkyrie," A captivating story about a true story
","Because of the despicable polemic Tom Cruise raised showing off his ´private´ life, I hadn´t managed to watch a film he is starring in for the past 14 years (the last one was Mission Impossible 3). However, as he keeps on being successful, that many of his ´recent´ films are on Netflix and that I like stories and documentaries about history, I decided to give it a chance. I did not regret for a second.
From the very first image, Tom Cruise caught my attention, playing this bitter Nazy who wants to kill Hitler. There are many other fims in which he did not completely convince me but in this one, he is simply brillant. The rest of the cast, Bill Nighy being the next name that I have in mind, is also stunning and gripping.
If the first hour was really good in the reconstitution of the events, the second half is even more captivating. I have read a critic saying the he was on the edge of his seat, and so was I. It is one of the very few films that grabbed me in the stomac from the very first minute until the very end, not only because of the story to which no one can be unsensitive to, but also because of the dynamic that is not leaving a second of respite.
Bryan Singer is once again showing a great attention to details that the audience has to follow as the story goes on no to loose any element. I already had greatly appreciated his work on The Usual Suspects and The X-men. So this is to be added to my list.
A gripping film that I will surely watch again.",10,0,0,4 July 2020

","The Simpsons succeeded at the tough challenge of the adaptation on the big screen. The scenario is consistent enough, there are new characters, as well as the ones we love so much, there are jokes of good quality in the spirit of the series throughout the film. However, as there is no ´catch-up´, it may be recommended to get familiar with the series before watching the film.",9,0,0,8 February 2019
The Martian," Space made in Hollywood
","I watched amused at first as Matt Damon is interpreting an astronaut who has a great sense of humour, seems to be capable of many things, including growing plants on Mars. I was finding the visual excellent, a good pace and a great soundtrack. Having had a look at the bad critics, I preferred to ignore them and just enjoy. This was up to one hour and 20 minutes.
Then, not to give any spoiler, comes a subplot about a plot that made my brain scream ´What???´. From then, I started becoming very sceptical about the basis of this story. It is based on a book that I haven´t read and I don´t know if it is based on a real event but I hardly believe it would be.
As I am not a scientist, I had taken for granted that what was on the screen was plausible but this subplot was so improbable, it made me question the past hour and 20 minutes that I had watched.
Matt Damon is having a lot of fun alone, doing some experiments, listening to pop music, growing plants, talking to the camera like the man on the street. Would an astronaut actually act like that?
Would the film have stopped after one hour and 20 minutes, I would have thought ´great entertainment´ but because of the subplot that comes out of the blue, I watched the last hour from a very different perspective.
I appreciated the visual and the music but the characters are not believeable. Matt Damon is funny, even touching at times, but the other characters are nearly inexistant. And the end is definitely made in Hollywood, not on Mars.
Have a look but make sure that you don´t go beyond the 80th minute or you will get very disappointed.",3,0,0,11 May 2020
