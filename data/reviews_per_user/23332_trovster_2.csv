"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Great collaboration between Schwimmer and Pegg
","David Schwimmer is at the helm in his theatrical directorial début, Run, Fatboy, Run: a story of love and perseverance but with a heavy twist of humour. The movie stars Simon Pegg as Dennis, the hapless protagonist yearning after his ex-fiancée, who he left pregnant at the altar five years ago! Now a washed-up, unfit (but not fat) security guard for a lingerie store, he is trying to win back the respect of his son and the love of his life.This isn't the first time Simon Pegg and David Schwimmer have collaborated. They starred alongside one another in the overlooked heist-gone-wrong comedy of confusion and betrayal, Big Nothing. I highly recommend both Big Nothing and Run, Fatboy, Run if you're a fan of British humour and sarcasm.",8,2,5,14 January 2008
Before Sunset," Even better than Before Sunrise
","Before Sunset is the absolutely beautiful sequel to Before Sunrise, two films by Richard Linklater starring Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy. Both movies focus on two very interesting characters, an American (Hawke) and a French woman, when they meet at junctures in their lives.In the first movie they meet for the very first time on a train and take a whimsical walk around the streets of Vienna. It's about discovering a place, memories, love and relationships, all of which are pieced together with beautiful dialogue and a fantastic story.Before Sunset is the sequel, set and filmed nine years after original. This time it follows the couple around the streets of Paris, and amazingly the dialogue surpasses the beauty of the previous movie. The cinematography is passive, yet intensive, which only enhances the stunningly crafted monologues. The couple meander, discussing what happened on that night all those years ago and how their lives have been influenced by their encounter.The dialogue is mesmerising - a real insight to both sides of emotion and love. I recommend watching 'Before Sunrise' before watching 'Before Sunset' to fully appreciate the magical journey of this romantic masterpiece.",9,0,0,14 January 2008
