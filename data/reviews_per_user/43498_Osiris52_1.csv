The Blair Witch Project," Warning: If you don't have an imagination, DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE!!
","In my honest opinion, this is the absolute scariest movie I have seen. I am sure that a lot of you out there can agree, that blood and gore is getting boring. Come on, even I was swept in by the hype of this movie, hell, I thought it was real until I saw the 'mock-umentary' on the Sci-Fi Channel. But, I decided to put the hype aside, and see it anyways. Boy, was I in for a surprise! Yeah, the first half crawled, but it sets up the rest of the movie. If you don't pay attention to the interviews, you will not understand the ending. I thought the acting was superb, that is just what I would do if I was lost in the woods, with weird things happening all around me. The last 20 minutes of the movie had my heart pounding, and my mind wondering, 'what is gonna happen next?' And that is what the movie is supposed to do, what you DO see is not supposed to scare you, what you DON'T see is what is the scariest. Bottom line: If you are into blood and gore, do not see this movie, see The Haunting, or The Sixth Sense. If you like to be scared by what is in the abyss of your mind, then by all means SEE THIS MOVIE!!!! 12/10 stars.",10,1,2,10 August 1999
