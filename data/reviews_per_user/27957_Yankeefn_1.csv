The Blair Witch Project," UNBELIEVABLY SCARY!
","I have been a horror buff since I was 8.  Back in the days of Mothra, Godzilla, Dracula, Frankenstein etc.  When I watched the Exorcist, I said that's it, that's the most frightening movie I'll ever watch in my lifetime. Now, 20+/- years later, the Exorcist has been defeated. This movie had me entranced from start to finish.  I loved the realism and in the horror scale of 1-10, this movie earns the 2nd 10 I've ever given.  Linda Blair, you're still the queen, but your movie just moved to #2.",10,1,2,9 August 1999
