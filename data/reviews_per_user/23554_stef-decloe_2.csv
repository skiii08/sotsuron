United 93," Brought back memories...
","At that very same time, I was on a flight from Paris to San Jose, CA. When the pilot announced we wouldn't get there because of 'terrorist attacks' on American airports and other strategic places, and when I saw the sadness on the crew's faces, I had only one thought: 'please, let us be safe'. Luckily, we stayed safe, we were redirected to Calgary, Canada, where we stayed for 10 day before being able to get back to Belgium.I was in charge of a group of 45 people, an 'incentive travel'. I remember passing my mobile phone to other passengers, mostly not belonging to my group, to allow them to call home to tell that we were going to be OK. But we still didn't know what happened in reality. It was horror when we discovered it, in a small room - with TV - at Calgary Airport.All my life I will remember the reception at Calgary Airport, the gentle people that helped us out, there. I will not go into details. It still is hard to remember. And I wasn't even directly involved.Just to say, I can imagine the fear, the horror, but also the braveness of the people, like me, like you, aboard that flight United 93. They were heroes, and this movie does them justice. May the be remembered always.",9,3,4,20 March 2013
The Other Boleyn Girl," I was not impressed
","Do not call this a 'historical movie'. It is full of inaccuracies, and even right down lies. Call it 'inspired by', or even 'based on', but not historical.How can actors and actresses agree to collaborate in such rewriting of history. How can producers and directors make such movies, pretending it to be historical? Knowing that a lot of people don't know the real history or don't care to verify...? I may be old fashioned about this, but I can't agree with this way of changing history for the sake of getting more audience.Furthermore (and I wasn't aware of this problem before watching - I never read comments before, but I happen to be an 'amateur historian' or at least, very interested in history), I wasn't very impressed by the actors... I found the whole thing sad, at some moments.I can't get out more than 5/10, and that is for some good images, and some minor characters. I'm sorry...",5,1,1,4 November 2012
