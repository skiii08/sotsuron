Gremlins," This movie deserves a 'thumbs up'!
","With a clever storyline and well crafted animation this horror/comedy makes for an entertaining 1 1/2 hours.  There are several cute scenes where you just can't help but laugh, but the dark and vivid violence ruins the chance of a family film.  Whether you like it or leave it, this film is a classic!",6,0,1,19 July 1999
A Clockwork Orange," There was me...
","And so begins the story of little Alex, a teenage punk who (with his three 'droogs') go out to have a night of fun at other peoples' expense.  The movie is not for everyone; you either love it or you hate it.  The movie is rated R for occasional profanity, 'ultraviolent' set pieces, and quite a bit of nudity.  If you can look beyond these things you will find a very interesting question:  If a man cannot choose to be good or evil, is he still a man?  So is the movie just some sick, violent, porno film?  Or does it go deeper into the mind than one might expect and leave you thinking?  The choice is up to you, so make it a good one.",9,0,0,3 July 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A young adult classic!
","Not one of the Python gang's best, but seems to be quite the rave for teenage viewers.  There are several laugh-out-loud scenes, but some spots in the film that are brutal and leave you disgusted.  If you like scatological humor and are entertained by blood than this is the movie for you.  Rated PG for profanity, violence, and sexual suggestions.",Null,0,0,19 July 1999
