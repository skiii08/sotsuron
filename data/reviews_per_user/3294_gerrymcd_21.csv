Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," terrable
","this was the first dvd i bought, and after watching the first 5 mins i took it back and got a better film , T2i like sci-fi films and love star wars, but this film was too much.  from ewan mc gregors acting and accent it was terriable.yes the special effects were excellent,,this is not enough to make a movie good.i couldnt bear the thought of owning this film so i suggest u dont either.rent it out.",3,0,1,30 November 2001

Catch Me If You Can," Enjoyable Good Film
","i enjoyed this film, and di caprio is very good is his part. (as already said,he acts much better here than Gangs of New York)its a very enjoyable film and i recommend it.  basic on a true story, wow how did he do that.8/10",Null,0,1,25 July 2003
The Ring," scarey and gripping
",this film was very good.  the first 30 mins are frightning especially the first 5 mins.  answering a phone after that was scarey.i got lost in the story and found it hard to understand it. but this is quite a scary movie.the tension is well built up in the first 30 mins but on the last 20 mins of the move u just dont know whats going to happen which i like in a film8/10,Null,1,1,10 August 2003
Training Day," Superb,but the ending is jus too hollywood
","Again no need to mention Denzels great performance, the movie is good and goes along well till the end which i think destroyed the film.I mean the good vs bad guy film roles in hollywood are rubbish, it just doesnt work and makes u feel cheated by the end.Ifu like thrillers then this is a great movie.But overall 9/10",8,0,11,19 August 2002
Monster," Tough and Miserable
","not an enjoyable movie but it never was going to be.  Having seen the Nick Broomfield documentary i was interested to see how this film would turn out. I was dissapointed that there were no court room showdowns, no nick broomfield.  While Charlize Theron does an great job of playing the murderer its not a very pleasant film to watch.  The film is carried by therons performance which is excellent.  Especially the last scene where she kills one of her clients ans he pleads for his lifewhich was quite hard to watch.  But a harsh reality check to those who think they have got it tough.7/10",6,0,0,2 August 2004
Alien: Resurrection," Awful
","A HUGE DISAPOINTMENT.this is awful. theres no atmosphere,co suspence,no tension and the ending is awful.this is one of the worst films ive seen, it seem they went for the special effects more than the films plot.the first 3 alien movies were superb. i though alien3 was bad, but when i seen this its makes alien3 look good.this is such as waste of film.its quite Gory more than the other 3, theres amost the exceptance of aliens which takes away the horror and mystery from the aliens.the character are terrible u cudnt care less wot happened 2 them.Avoid this.",4,0,1,12 August 2002
Insomnia," Very Good
","i liked this film, it was a real thriller u didnt know wot was going to happen next. williams is creep as the baddy and PAcino is Pacino.one of the better films ive seem this year. 8/10",8,0,1,29 March 2003
Alien," Scary Stuff
","This is film making at its best, a long slow build up and a tension packed ending. Whats more impressive that the sets and design still look great today well part from the Space Ships.To think that this film was made in 1979 in unbelievable, its undated which is the mark of a great film. i watched the DVD a few weeks ago and its worth getting because it has ridleys scots commentary which gives great insite into the film.The sets look huge and scary, the music is fantastic very classical peaceful music which thunders when ever needed.Great stuff, i don't know if its scarier than Aliens but its has a better atmosphere of Deep space.",9,0,1,22 February 2002
Lost in Translation," Superb
","I was wondering what all the fuss was about this film but after seeing it i see why. Its a nice film that makes a change to see. I'm sick and tired of the standard Hollywood turd movies that get made. But this is special. The cinematography is beautiful as said and makes Japan look an amazing place.Firstly i guess if you don't like Bill Murray then you wont like the movie. Scarlet Johanson is stunning, beautiful and lost in Japan with bill Murray. There's nothing more to the film than two people being lost. what can you do when you are lost? you can try and move on or you can stay put. At one point in life we all feel lost and this film is just showing two people lost or trapped in lives they realize they don't want anymore. Scenes of Scarlet Johanson's character looking out into the city OK Tokiyo are amazing and show the loneliness of being away from home in a big city.I must admit i couldn't take my eyes of Scarlet Johanson she really was stunning, captivating. This is what makes the movie work is the chemistry between the two. They know they like each other but are afraid to make the next move, afraid to change their lives. I loved this movie and its one the best films I've seen in the last year. Some people wont like it and thats there loss but it really is a wonderful film. Its great to see a film so refreshing and new make it.8/10",8,2,7,30 July 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Beautiful,Superb,Amazing,Masterpiece
","A lot was said about this film and its all true.Although the above comments about about the ending are stupid.  As there is no ending as the ending sets the story up for the next Film the 2 Towers, as in the book.The scenery is superb, New Zealand is seems a beautiful place just as ireland is.Its amazing to take the book and to do it justice on screen, which is what has been done.Although if you like Action movies then this is not for you.  As your only gonna moan about how long it is.  But if you like Movies then its well worth the look.  im now reading the nexk book the 'The 2 Towers' so as i can understand the film better when its realised in December.I hope the DVD set in november will give more insight into the film than the August Version which documentries arnt too good.  An extra 30 minutes will be very interesting as its already quite a long film but i will defenitely buy it.This Film is beautiful and it can only get better.  A Masterpiece of Film Making.",10,1,1,12 August 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," All Action..no Heart
",i couldnt wait to see this film..as the first 2 films were very good..SPOILERS ******************************the trailers looked awesome..arnie on the back of the crane..the TX.. but it just didnt feel like a Terminator movie...the most notable thing was the music..there was none..where was Brad Friedals Theme tune?.. this shocked me..as how can you have a sequel with no theme tune? anyway..while this move isnt bad..its just not very good..sure the stunts and action is cool..but the film is short..has no dialog..rememember T2 and arnies one-liners which were so funny..he hardly says anything here..still its a good move..i must admit the ending was shocking as i expected a typical good guy saves the world ending..overall the film was too short..lacked heart..and feels like a Promo for Arnies Political career..7/10,Null,0,0,10 September 2003
U-571," Hollywood rubbish
","I only got round to seeing this film the other day as i was interested to see what sort of a story the film would be about the Enigma machines. The real problem with the film apart from the huge plot holes and unbelievable story is that the film tries to be a 'Historical Drama' and a standard 'Hollywood Action' Film this is where the problem starts. When i say 'Historical Drama' i mean it tries to present the story of the Americans capturing the Enigma machine, solving the codes and saving the world and have these as real events that happened or least it gives the impression of this.'Hollywood Action' Film The over the top action and just the imposable happening ans this film takes the idea of reality and throws it out the window.The film isn't bad if it had just tried to be a Hollywood film but it tries too hard to be both and falls flat on its face. It tries to recover from this by insulting putting at the end of the film 'What really happened' of course the English captured most of these machines and solved the Enigma code. Which is an insult but its hardly surprising of a Hollywood movie. Of course this all comes the same director who made Terminator 3 so its not much of a surprise.3/10",3,3,7,12 March 2007
Revolutionary Road," Dull Movie with Wooden characters
","I really wanted to like this film kate winslet is great in it but the movie just doesn't work as a film. Its characters are just not believable and the core of the movie is just so dull that nothing interesting happens. Just because actors make a good performance in a movie sure doesn't mean the movie is worth watching.There's no doubt Di Caprio is a very versatile actor and a good actor like Winslet but the film spends far too long ith the same story thread that it just becomes dull.The 'mental' neighbour is a joke, its like a character they just added who could point out the mess and problems that Winslet and Di Caprios characters have. Its such a lazy, lame wooden character used to put some kinda 'realism' into the movie that it just fails big time.",4,4,9,3 February 2009
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Superb,Amazing
","Ive never a kung fu movie or any kida chinese related film or a film with subtitles, but this was a unique film.i though the fight in the matrix was good (the same stunt guy worked on both this fim and The Matrix) but the fights in this are unbelievable.the locations are amazing too and the story is enough to make you wanna see the rest of the film.i enjoyed this film, its got a great cast, music score ,etc etc any Film Fan will love this film.. 8/10",8,0,0,5 January 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," simply, Superb
",i have been waiting to see this film for 9 months..as i never went to see it in the cinema..now i wish i had to have.. from the very moment the film opens you know its going to be good.having read the 'Two Towers Book' after being blown away by the Fellowship..and i hate reading books..i couldnt wait to see how the film would compare with the book...i must admit if youve read the book..its hard not to nit pick your way throuigh the film..but its still a fantastic film...after buying the DVD i must say that the extras are quite poor..but i will be waiting to buy the 'Special Extended version' in Nov as the documentaries are first class and with 4 Audio Comentries its a must have DVD..if there ever was a film to show off DVD and your 5.1 sound system this is the film...the only critiscism i have is that they leave out a section of the the 'Two Towers' book where Gollum leads them into a Cave to meet 'Her'this was amazing to read in the book..and was one of things i was looking forward to seeing..but it will be in the 'Return of the king' which i guess is ok.my advice is to enjoy the film and leave ur critic thoughts outside the room.10/10,10,0,0,27 August 2003
World Trade Center," Poor
","Watching 2 guys stuck under rubble isn't my idea a great movie. this film is a wasted opportunity on 9/11 and quite dull. The characters in the movie are so typical of what you would expect of these sorta characters, perfect wife, home and family. I fail to see how this film has any relevance. We all know the police and firefighters that went into them buildings were heros and sitting through this to see 2 guys stuck under rocks is such a waste. The movie provides no thought on the current situation in the world is a dumbing down of the whole 9/11 event. Its a shame that oliver stone made this film as there's nothing that great about it ands its truly a forgettable boring experience.",5,0,2,30 November 2006
The Last King of Scotland," Gripping and disturbing
",I watched this film because i had heard so much about it and it lived up to they hype. The film is totally gripping and Forrest Wittaker is superb as the dictator. I didn't stop watching the film for one second throughout you simply couldn't. Both Whittaker's and the Scottish doctor are very charming characters particularly Whittaker's in the beginning.Its rare to see such a fantastic film as this which moves at a nice pace pealing away the layer of the dictators true persona and having such a great cast and great acting as well.Its a pity Gillian Andersons character didn't get more time on screen as shes such a great actress and of course beautiful.A superb film 9/10,8,4,5,6 March 2007
The Matrix," Good but over Rated
","hearing the non stop hype abou this film, and the computer Game Max PAyne (using bullet time and other bits from the film , to make one kick ass game) i thought id buy the DVD.By the way if u a Matrix fan Buy Max PAyne, its almost a complement to the Film.well i watched it and thought hmmm.while the film is fantastic i just didnt walk thinking anymore about it...the kunfu scenes are great credit to the actors for training...one thing i will say i cant wait for the Matrix2 and 3",9,0,0,22 February 2002
Hart's War," Surprisingly good
","this is quite a good film, although u have to take the movie as it comes and ignore the cliches.the acting is superb colin farrel and bruce willis are superb, its not gonna blow u away buts its a very good film.the suspence of the film is enough to enjoy it and its well worth a look",Null,5,9,2 December 2002
Gangs of New York," Oh Dear....
","theres nothing good i can say about this film...i really mean that. i was looking forward to watching this and hoping for it to be a great film...but dear o dear...its not lord of the rings i dunno how to describe it.i think Di Caprio does his best, but the story is jus silly? why wud some1 seeking revenge go along with the killer and hang out? totaly rubbishdaniel day lewis is evil...hes good @ being bad but thats it. this film was over-hyped...im looking forward to LOTR:2 towers and return of the king.id give it 5/10",Null,0,0,16 July 2003
