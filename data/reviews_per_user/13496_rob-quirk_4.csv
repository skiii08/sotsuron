Requiem for a Dream," Graphic and Powerful
","This powerful film follows the intertwined lives of four people as they descend a downward spiral caused by drug addiction. We see the three young characters Harry, Tyrone, and Marion innocently begin to sell drugs to satiate their ever growing habits. We see the human sides of them, the potential they hold, and their love for others slowly get destroyed as the drugs take control of their lives. We also witness Harry's lonely mother, Sara, descend into a similar hopeless state, but in her case the drugs are legal, and prescribed to her by a doctor. When she is prescribed her weight loss pills, the doctor does not even look at her. A chilling parallel is drawn; her doctor and the street dealers are shown to have the same total disregard for the lives of their buyers. For a time everyone's life is good, everyone has money, and Harry's mother loses weight and feels accepted by her friends. But it doesn't last, and one by one they descend into a state of hopeless desperation. It is all very graphic, and it left me with a profound feeling towards the horrible effects of addictive drugs. All of the actors do a spectacular job portraying their characters, and I really felt for them. This film should be shown to anyone who is having thoughts about experimenting with drugs. It is shocking and brutal, but it has to be in order to truly reflect the world it portrays.",9,0,0,25 March 2003
Minority Report," Bland and predictable
","This unimpressive science fiction film has an interesting premise, but ultimately fails to deliver anything more than an average cinematic experience. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, an expert cop in the field of pre-crime. Pre-crime is a method of catching criminals before they commit murder through the use of psychics. The society has been using this technology for some time and crime rates are at an all time low. Ironically he discovers that he will commit a murder in about a day, and the movie follows him as he tries to determine what will lead to this impending act, all the while his fellow comrades are hunting him down. It is a fascinating premise, but it just did not pull me in like other science fiction movies, such as `The Matrix'. The futuristic designs are impressive, and the acting is okay, but there was not enough to keep me immersed in the film due to the underdeveloped characters. Most of their actions and their motivations did not make any sense, and the plot seemed designed only to provide twists. It is almost like the writers thought of the plot twists before anything else, and then wrote the rest of the movie around them. It did make me think about the possible moral issues that would be raised if such a system crime was used to put people in jail, but the movie merely skimmed over these issues. Overall it was an okay film, but the plot twists were somewhat silly, and it dragged on because of pointless subplots.",6,5,8,25 March 2003
12 Angry Men," true cinema classic
","Even though this film was made in 1957, the issues it raises are still relevant to us today. Racism is still a widespread problem in North American society, especially in our judicial system. Often people's judgments are affected by cultural and racial factors, whether consciously or subconsciously, and this movie captures this aspect of human nature perfectly. The acting was very good, with Henry Fonda and Lee Cobb having the stand out performances. They pull off their roles as the two polar opposites very well, and the other 10 characters fit in-between them on the personality spectrum. As the movie progresses the tension increases, and the characters struggle with their own convictions. The jury room seems to close in on them as they all take their turns debating and stating their opinions. Even though there is no action, and the plot is pushed forward solely by dialogue, the movie still totally engrosses you as a viewer, which establishes it as a true cinema classic. 9/10",9,0,1,25 March 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Although I slightly preferred The Fellowship of the Ring to this movie, it is still an epic and stirring film.
","This is the film adaptation of the second novel in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. It follows the surviving characters from `The Fellowship of the Ring' as they continue their dangerous quest. The visual style, storyline, cinematography, acting and special effects all combine to create another milestone in filmmaking. I visited New Zealand shortly before the filming started there for the trilogy, and I actually read the novel `The Two Towers' while I was there. I could not help but project the landscapes I saw while I was there into to the book I was reading. Seeing these same landscapes now immortalized in the film version is just amazing. Some of the changes between the film and the book are quite drastic, but they should be accepted as they are two entirely different art forms that sometimes cannot be directly translated. The acting is very good, although there are many actors who have to share the three hour run time, so we only get a brief taste of many of them. The main characters are still engrossing, and the computer generated character `Gollum' is utterly convincing and realistic, almost heartbreaking at times. This film contains some of the most advanced special effects in any film, and part of their appeal is in the way they are used. Instead of blatantly using flashy effects in every scene like other directors, Jackson instead tries to use them discretely. During most of the battle scenes it seems entirely possible that we are witnessing thousands of extras, not computer generated effects, acting out the battle. Although I slightly preferred The Fellowship of the Ring to this movie, it is still an epic and stirring film.",9,0,0,25 March 2003
