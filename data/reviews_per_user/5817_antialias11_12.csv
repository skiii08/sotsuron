Blade Runner 2049," Average movie...need not have been made.
","***This will contain mild spoilers**Here's the good, the bad and the ugly on this movie:The good: I didn't mind the slow pacing of the movie. Hollywood needs to embrace more of this to create atmosphere and get the moviegoer immersed in the setting. This movie does so but sometimes goes out the other side. The 'computer girlfriend' was cute and some of the ideas involving her were interesting, setting the 'next level' beyond asking how human can replicants be: how human can software be? More human than human? There's a few nice nods to the original from the advertisements to the musical score to the recreation of the landmark look of the Tyrell Corp. building and some minor set pieces.The bad: Ryan Gosling just isn't a very good actor. He does his best, I guess, with what he got given. He's the pretty face du-jour and puts (female) bums in seats. That's about all there is to say about him. Not one of Harrison Ford's best performances, but he's alright. The main villain likes to drone on to no point and purpose. The female villain is even more pointless in her motivation. As antagonists go they come off as stereotypes more than anything. The CGI of the exteriors and interiors is OK.The ugly: The other female is no Daryl Hannah - even though they obviously tried to cast a lookalike. The rest of the supporting cast is weak/one-dimensional and some of the expositionary dialogues are downright cringeworthy - explaining things that *must* be known to the character being talked at to the point that they might as well be holding up a neon-sign with 'audience, listen up'. As for clich√©s: 'Give me your badge and your gun and you have 48 hours'. Really? Cameos: Edward James Olmos' cameo is unnecessary for...anything. A de-aged Sean Young hits the uncanny valley (just as the de-aged Kurt Russel did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2)While I applaud the boldness to forego the incessant fast cuts of other movies the director has no capacity for distinguishing between a shot necessary to build an atmosphere vs. one that is just 'O-golly-gee'. If they had taken out the latter the movie could have been cut by 30 minutes and would have been better off for it.3D - oh my. 3D is the bane of movies these days. Entirely unnecessary for this movie (I know of only one movie where 3D adds a stylistically logical element and that is 'Tron: Legacy', where the computer world is in 3D and the real world is in 2D)The movie also lacks any sort of emotion. The director seems to think that putting a tear in someone's eye denotes deep emotion and will grip the audience. We see basically *everyone* in this movie shedding tears - and none of it touched me one bit (quite a feat!). There's no nuances, here. There's no small facial movements (like the great scene between Priss and Roy in the original where they talk with just their eyes). The replicants are more terminators than artificial humans when it comes to emotions. So are the humans, come to think of it.Conclusion: Worth watching? If you liked the original: Maybe. Just so you can say you've seen it and know why the original is a masterpiece (because it sure as hell is compared to this) Otherwise this is a movie you can easily skip.",5,4,7,11 November 2017
Akira," A very good movie
","Excellent entertainment. It has it's small flaws, but it also has a lot of big strenghts.The animation is so beautiful it's breathtaking. Watching what looks like a million pieces of glass fall to earth in slow motion in one scene is a visual feast in its own right. Attention to detail has always been the forte of anime - and here it is taken to a new level. The color scheme sets it apart from most other animated movies, and the combination of ultra-high tech look with traditional Japanese music works astonishingly well.The story - well I am in two minds about that. Certainly it is original, and it moves along smoothly. The story is also not too far dumbed down for the lowest common denominator, and we even get to be treated to some political and socio-critical comments. The characters seem human. They gain a little depth and the violence they dish out isn't just there to make you go 'Wow'. They don't just kill and walk on. The heroine even has nearly a hysterical fit after she kills. This helps no end to identify with the human side of the protagonists.However, the point I dread in most anime movies is the long 'I'll explain the meaning of life, the universe and everything'-speech which seems to be a must in these type of films. Unfortunately at this point most writers make complete fools of themselves and 'Akira' is no exception here. When watching it once you can just get over it and move on. But if you watch it many times, like I have, this scene will get on your nerves. This somehow devalues what would have otherwise been the best anime movie of its time (and it is this part which elevates 'Ghost in the Shell' to the number one spot in my personal hit list of anime)The ending is OK, although I think the animation guys totally flipped their lids in the 'mutation scene', but it's fun to watch nevertheless.If you have never seen anime before this will change your view of what animated movies can do. 9/10",9,1,3,23 January 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," What I expected
","I went to see this movie not because I really anticipated it, but because I had seen the first two and wanted too get it over with.Action: Matrix are action movies (duh!). Where the first was ground braking in terms of quality, the second was groundbreaking in terms of quantity. The third broke no ground at all. The CG was nice, if a bit stilted in some scenes. I missed any scenes that made me go 'whoa - that was cool'. There was lots of action after the first hour - I'll grant it that. But none really gripped the audience as it was all totally foreseeable (last stand, heroic fight, individuals act bravely, dying command of a hero, last minutes save, some unimportant people die, fall back to last defensive position, enemies behaving stupidly throughout the engagement - they have those nice laser beams - why didn't they use them once? or throw some of their bombs into the dome first...duh.)Philosophy: All the philosophy that was hinted at in the first movie and which was somewhat continued in the second was blatantly ignored here. Stupid one-liners and questions answered with questions. I must say that what they tried to bite off philosophically would have been more than a dozen movies could chew - but the hype and the extent to which the attempt failed amazed me. The actors: Hugo Weaving was incredible as always. You can see he is having incredible amounts of fun playing Smith - the man should get an Oscar for best supporting actor. His speeches (at least in Matrix 1&2) and his pronunciation are a feast. As for the others: Trinty actually got me to hate her in this flic. Mostly because she acted like a beaten kitten all the time and due to the interminable death scene. Morpheus/Fishburne was just a subdued little boy reciting his litany 'believe, believe, believe' where he was full of energy in the other movies. Keanu/Neo - lets not go there...if he was the dream-cast for the role then they must have missed the application by a 2x4. The Meregovian - while this character actually had something to say he said the same thing he stated in the second movie over again. Bringing in a number of extra characters was totally superfluous - even if you have seen the Animatrix. Who the hell cared about 'the kid'? What was he there for? Why make him such a big part? Why the trainman? He doesn't do anything for the story. (and the joke in Mobile (=Limbo?) Ave was rather foreseeable/lame. I knew what would happen as soon as the camera stopped following Neo *yawn*.)To make a long story short: Go rent it on DVD, so that you can at least say you have seen them all. Don't waste your bucks for this.",4,0,0,11 November 2003
Van Helsing," utter tripe
","Don't get me wrong, I love a good action movie with lots of cool weapons, stunts and unexpected twists, but... ....this was another of these movies that should never have been made. It seems like I was watching a 2 hour trailer for an ego-shooter. All the authors of the original monster-literature (Frankenstein, Dracula, Dr. Jeckyl & Mr. Hyde, Werewolf, ... ) must be turning in their graves. The movie butchered them all for some cheap visual effects (and when I say cheap, I mean CHEAP). The computer graphics were thoroughly unconvincing - partially even worse than in 'The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'. Plot and Character-development were next to non-existent. When the heroine dies there was not one tear in the house - nobody cared. The character was just developed that badly. The end fight was totally anti-climatic. The plot as illogical and contradictory as it can get (and I am not including monsters and vampire-hunters into 'illogical'). The stunts? Totally unbelievable (yeah... right, we fight in high heeled boots, jump all over the place and land after a 50 foot drop on our feet..uh huh). Jackman does his wolverine-shtick. Nothing new there. The comedic-sidekick didn't have one line  that wasn't totally lame. Who wrote this stuff?Oh yeah, speaking of comedic sidekick. The movie was so full of cliches that it hurt. Right down to the hero and his pal riding off into the sunset. I would have almost blown chunks at that point. The 'story' seemed ripped from a book called 'how to write a movie plot in 5 minutes'. Boooooring.What is there left to say? Normally when I don't like a movie I at least tell people to go watch it on DVD and make up their own mind. But if you do it with this flick, then all I have to say is: It's your money - you can decide how you waste it.Rating 1/10 (i.e. I want my money back!)",1,0,2,6 August 2004
Yesterday," Would this work without the Beatles' songs?
","Short answer is: no it wouldn't.Spoilers ahead. You have been warned:Two sentence plot summary: A unsuccessful musician gets thrown into an alternate universe (without any explanation of how and why) where various (pop-culture) things haven't happened but almost everything else is at is it today: Among them Harry Potter, Oasis, cigarettes and the Beatles. He recreates the Beatles' songs as his own, becomes famous and almost doesn't get his girl (but of course comes clean very publicly and gets her in the end).So what do we have here? A whole bunch of problems.The problem with the plot:
It's lazy writing from A to Z. You know: The type of romantic comedy where the two fated lovers cannot confess their love for one another over a huge amount of time (and 2 hours of movie-time) because people are interrupting, phones are ringing and doors are knocked on. In the end the guy gives up fame to get his girl. Original? Not in the slightest. Even the universe-shifting at the start merely exists to string scenes together in which Beatles songs can be played (and then mostly only fragments thereof).The problem with the actors:
The protagonist and the girl are likeable enough. No one else in the movie (apart from the two who also remember the Beatles) is. Kate McKinnon doesn't ever seem to catch a break with the lousy scripted stereotype characters she's handed - and this movie is no exception, making her play the standard money-hungry agent. Most of the side-characters are only there for the 'cringe-humor'. The drug using firend. the fake fanboi-friend, the father, the mother, the neighbor, the list goes on.The problem with the humor:
It feels like the movie desperately tries to put in a funny moment her and there but this basically boils down to the protagonist finding out that X isn't there in this universe, googles it and finds something else unde the same name. Calling this a RomCom would beg the question: 'What comedy'? The theater was reasonably full but there wasn't a single laugh. A few isolated chuckles was the best it ever got.The music:
The movie very heavily relies on the recognizability of Beatles songs. Which is to say: The music - when it's a Beatles song - is great. Any other time it's 'meh' at best (and the recognizability of Oasis today is more of a: Oasis...who?). And here is really where it all falls apart. If it weren't for the nostalgia (i.e. if the Beatles were replaced with a fictional band and fictional songs) then this movie would be utterly boring to watch.2 Stars for the Beatles songs. Zero stars for anything else.",2,3,8,20 August 2019
Batman Begins," An OK movie?
","Maybe it's OK. But is it a good movie? Let alone a good batman movie? By no means. It's a dark movie. Supposedly they had a screening of Blade Runner before starting to shoot, but ask yourselves: Is this anywhere near Blade Runner Quality? If your answer is 'yes' then you didn't see the same movie I saw. Batman movies live and die by the acting capability of batman and the villain(s) and lets face it: Christian Bale is a pretty bad batman - only slightly better than Kilmer and a little worse than Clooney (and both were horrible at it). Where is the inner conflict? Where is the near insanity that Keaton betrayed so perfectly? The near-self destructiveness that Villains like Catwoman (Michelle Pfeiffer)? Where is the multi-dimensionality of the characters like The Joker (Nicholson)that has made Batman movies higher quality than Superman drivel? Arguably these actors set a pretty high gold standard as batman figures go, but if you can't play in their league then don't try. No, Bale is just a pretty face with next to no acting ability. Michael Caine could outact this guy with his head in a paper bag and all four limbs tied behind his back.Now on to the villains: After I left the theater I had already forgotten what their names were. That's a pretty bad sign. Liam Neeson can act better than this. He just warmed up his Qi-Gon Jinn routine from the Star wars flop. Not good enough - by a long shot.The girl? Don't even ask. She was just thrown in there as an addition for some T&A. Can you spell 'superfluous'? I know the director/writers can't.The effects were OK, that's why I will give this a 3/10 (The car was a bit over the top, though. That's not a batmobile, that's something you can pass off in a war movie). Summary: Not worth my money, not worth my time (not even on DVD)",3,2,7,2 September 2005
Avengers: Infinity War," Sub par
","*** Warning, mild spoilers ahead *** Ok, what sticks out about this movie? Nothing much. 
The acting is lackluster. No character has a character arc - understandable because none of them are given any significant screen time. The whole movie is basically one endless 3-hour brawl (with some battle scenes blatantly ripped from Star Wars/Lord of the Rings). Some of the brawls are so over-the top that they are ludicrous (even by comicbook standards). Example: When you break a moon into pieces and hurl all of them at someone on the planet below within one second then the impacting pieces should not just make a puff of dust when they land. The motivation of the villain makes no sense (after achieving his goal the universe will just be back to the earlier situation soon enough). Given that it's hard to emote with a villain in the first place having a full CGI villain makes it even less likely. Some of Gamoras mood swings in the matter where we're supposed to emote with him or her make even less sense.Speaking of CGI: It's on a level we've come to expect with some weird exceptions. E.g. in one instance we see Bruce Banner's head in the open cockpit of the Hulkbuster armor while he's standing around in the background - and it looks like someone just copied it in with MS-Paint. Seriously. Not even Photoshop quality but MS-Paint.The humor is relegated to one-liners and most don't land. The serious one-liners are predictable and pithy. 
The music score is effective if somewhat over-the-top pathos-heavy (but that's not unusual for US films, so it' one of those things we've come to expect to have to endure)The overwhelming feeling is that this movie was 'designed by comittee'. The boardroom idea seems to have been: 'Take the things that people enjoyed in other movies and make them non-stop'. 
Problem is: It doesn't work that way. Gems in movies are that because they are rare. Taking the time to lead up to them makes the payoff all that sweeter.After coming back I rewatched the first Avengers movie just to see if my memory deceived me. But no: It is a way, way, WAY superior film in every respect.",3,214,514,13 May 2018
The Incredibles," Why this movie is fun...
","Is it the fact that it has an excellent Bond-esque soundtrack? No. Is it the fact that the action is non stop? No. Is it the fact that it has such a neat story and such lifelike characters that you hardly gawk at the pretty pictures and think to yourself 'Wow, neat computer graphics!'? No. Is it the countless homages and allusions within the movie? No. Well what is it?To me its the fact the people at Pixar do something special. Other movie companies (especially Disney) seem to go out and ask people what they find funny. They seem to do surveys on laughs, clocking competitors movies for laughs per minute, and then average it out - trying to find some common denominator in 'funny' and generally doing 'humor by committee' - and consequently totally missing the point about what makes people laugh.Humor is the unexpected. The extraordinary that wrenches our brain into surprising directions. Pixar people seem to just put in there what makes themselves laugh - without worrying if it is politically incorrect or unsuitable for the target audience. If it fits the mood it's stuck in. Maybe they will not reach such a wide audience (PG rating) but they surely create classics that way which will have a big payoff in the long run. Somehow this total identification of the makers with the humor is transferred to the effort put into animating the characters - giving them just the right kind of attitude and mimics because the people that animate them know exactly how the characters are thinking. They seem to have as much fun making the movie as we have watching it. The result is the difference between a factory made pie and one made by grandma. Both may contain the same ingredients and be made by the same method, but one is made with love and one is made by machines - it shows in the detail, and registers with the audience. Thank you Pixar for -yet again- an excellent movie that lets me forget all the mediocre garbage from your competitors I have watched the past year.My rating: 9/10",9,0,1,3 December 2004
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," OK...I guess.
","The first thing that went through my mind after I left the theater was:Too. Much. CGI.Don't get me wrong: I love some epic battles, but here it just felt constant to the point of nausea. Where's the suspense if our heroes survive a score of against-the-odds fights? Yes, we all know the hero(es) must win one of those in a any of these movies. But half a dozen or so? Come on. At some point nothing feels like a threat anymore. And certainly the CGI doesn't help. Yes it's pretty, but it feels pointless despite (or maybe just because of) its obvious over-prettiness. It's one 'oh golly' scene after another. When will Hollywood learn that that doesn't work?On the positive side: What we do get are some good moments from Nebula and Gamora, Yondu and Rocket - and of course Baby Groot steals the show (not a good sign when your best character is a CGI creature with only one line of dialogue). The other characters (including Pratt's lead and Russel's villain) came off as very superficial (I know that Drax is supposed to be that - but his kind of cringe/toilet humor just doesn't do it for me).Speaking of humor: I dunno. The first movie seemed to have this down better. It's like they were trying too hard this time around. The 'duct tape' scene was genuinely funny, though, I'll give them that.The music: Also very forgettable. Is this the best they could scrounge up for an 80's mix tape? I didn't recognize a single song (and yes, I grew up in that time period).So is it a good movie? No. It's passable. A textbook example of a sequel. Something that will either be forgotten if the third installment is good, or will be marked as the point when the franchise went downhill. Do I want to watch a sequel? Probably not. What I would totally watch is a spin-off featuring Stallone's Ravager's, though!",5,28,56,30 April 2017
Blade Runner," A movie you have to watch twice
","First time I saw this I wasn't impressed. Maybe because I expected more action from a Sci-Fi movie. Then I rented it on VHS, and upon re-watching I figured something out: This is one of the very few movies that gets better the more often you see it. It is a subtle movie. Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.I don't particularly care for the director's cut version, though. The inner monologue is missing - which gives you some of the most thought inspiring moments, and some of the added scenes downright make no sense at all. if I'd seen that one first I might never have given it a second chance.The cast is exceptional. Every one of them does a really fine job. Especially Rutger Hauer who otherwise has very few good movies to his name (maybe 'Day of the Falcon') delivers a stunning performance. Most of the cast who were unknown before this movie have moved on to fame (and some to fortune) - and rightfully so.From a technical point of view there is not much to criticize. More than 20 years later this movie still doesn't look dated (apart from 'Atari'-neon signs). The atmosphere is created with a lot of attention to detail, and the models of buildings are some of the most beautiful and believable ones I have ever seen.Now I recently read the book on which it is based ('Do androids dream of electric sheep' by Philip K. Dick). It's a quirky read and, frankly, not a very good book. It has too many plot holes, deus-ex-machina devices and logical inconsistencies, plus a total letdown of an ending. What it does add to the movie is the setup of why the atmosphere is like it is (polluted, dark, many 'freaks' around), and the nice question whether the Hero might be a replicant himself.",10,175,292,4 January 2005
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Different things to like about this
","Well, I just re-watched this on DVD. I first saw it when I was 10 in 1981, and I still love this move (one of my all time favorites), but I guess I love it for some reasons different than most other people:1) The movie has no love story to speak of. This is such a huge bonus that it cannot be stressed enough. For kids a love story is sheer boredom - and there are unfortunately very few films without one. For adults the love story is usually pure BS (as the over romanticizing that goes on in Hollywood movies make any love story a nauseous experience. Episodes V and VI scrape the line of how much love story a movie can take before being totally corny. Lets not talk about how much the love story ruins episodes I and II (and will probably kill episode III also))2) There are no lengths in the movie. It dumps you right in the middle of the conflict after the opening (no opening credits to bore your pants off! This is almost unique amongst films). It practically grabs you before you have gotten comfortable in your seat. The DVD does add some lengths with gratuitous CGI which actually hurt the film more than they help (the ride into Mos Eisley and the Falcon approaching Yavin seem interminable compared to the fast paced cuts of the original version. These scenes break the rhythm of the movie badly, they add neither story nor depth nor information - luckily they are far enough apart not to hurt it too much)3) The special effects are still spectacular after all these years. Not in what they look like but how they are shot, the dynamics of it and the ideas for cool POVs (taking old aerial battle films as scripts was a stroke of genius)4) Detail. This thing is all about attention to detail. There is nothing out of place here. Nothing glossed over by large plastic sheeting. everything has structure and depth and looks used. The world it portrays becomes believable. economies are worked out. This has the look of a good role playing adventure.5) The plot isn't explained by the characters. Characters involved in such a plot for some time are supposed to know what the background is without having to talk to each other about it (nobody needs to be told that the empire is evil, this is common knowledge with these people as they have lived under it for decades). Putting things into the scroller at the beginning which could not be said by the characters because it would be akin to them holding up neon signs displaying 'For the audiences' information' was a stroke of genius. I cringe at other movies that insert 'let me explain what is happening' scenes.Overall I can see nothing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack and the sound effects are amazing. Some scenes seem to be re-recorded with different sound standards and thus stand out uncomfortably, but this isn't much of a problem. The actors do their jobs well (especially Harrison Ford when he flashes that roguish grin - he is practically the archetype of the lovable, charismatic scoundrel). This DVD is definitely a keeper (10/10).",10,5,7,3 October 2004
A Walk to Remember," I never will forget this...
","Truly a thing to remember...this film will stick in memory as THE most trite of christian white American fantasies ever - full of pathos, blind obedience and 'better-than-thou' messages. As a european I couldn't decide wether to die laughing or crying as to how horribly boring and predictable this movie was. laughing, because of the bad acting and terrible stereotyping. crying, because if this movie and the viewer comments I have read are any indication, then I pray to whatever deities are out there (or not) that such attitudes never come to europe. I wasted an entire euro on renting this DVD - a euro I will remember forever as the worst spent money of my life.",1,5,13,7 June 2003
