Hereditary," Wasn't expecting too much
","It was my turn to pick a scary movie, and since my wife recently became interested in her family history/ancestors, I thought this might be a decent one to pick to freak her out. Boy was I right. This movie nailed it on so many different levels. From shock factor, to jump scares, to WTF moments, it's all there. If you like horror that isn't cheesy and is true at its core you will like this movie.",8,1,2,12 January 2019
