Catch Me If You Can," Another boy who makes believe
","'Spielberg is both politically backward (liberal, that is, rather than radical, reaching, humane) and, like his nut-job U.S. president, totally bereft of curiosity. [] He remains enraptured by respectability, orthodoxy and the status quo. It's doubtful that enlightenment will ever strike him.' - Dennis Grunes Steven Spielberg's 'Catch Me If You Can' opens with a stylised credit sequence, a homage to Saul Bass and the caper/con/heist/spy/Pink-Panther/Saint movie credits of the 1960s. What follows is Spielberg's version of Tony Curtis' 'The Great Imposter' and Wendell Harris' 'Chameleon Street', though here our hero is teen-aged con-man Frank Abagnale (Leonardo DiCaprio), an emotionally wounded kid who lies to others as a means of escaping the lies he tells himself.All of Spielberg's pros and cons are on display. Moments of sexuality, romance and swearing ring awkward or false, the film's comedy is clunky, all female characters are whores, bimbos, nitwits or betrayers, the terrifying, darker aspects of 'real-life Frank' are ignored and the film's last act is bloated. Spielberg cheats with some of the images as well, using postcard pictures, fancy clothes, an animated intro, chirpy music, cutesy nods to Truffaut and slick montages to convey an impression of either fun or loneliness. It's all very mechanical. A collection of references rather than anything substantial.Though it aims for a breezy tone, the film's start-stop narrative is more a collection of vignettes. Spielberg's camera also rarely conveys a sense of true three dimensional space, and like 'Minority Report', one is always aware that there is nothing, no space, no landscape, beyond the edges of each sound stage, each set-piece, each street corner or those blazing shafts of white light which seem to cordon off each sequence. Watch, for example, how small the film's street scenes are, or how closed off its airport sequences feel. With Spielberg, there's never anything beyond the set piece, a facet which he tried to rectify with 'The Terminal' (where space and architecture become the lead character).Still, there's a lot of great stuff on display. DiCaprio's fantasy world is infectious, Spielberg clearly having fun as DiCaprio does likewise. Forging cheques, playing make-believe, living a fantasy life, these are all things which appeal to Spielberg. The film's 'real human drama' is also handled much better here than elsewhere in Spielberg's filmography, and unlike most con-man movies ('The Sting', 'Ocean's Eleven' etc), Spielberg always stresses the pain (see 'California Split') underlying each of DiCaprio's flights into white-collar fantasy (though DiCaprio's victims are given no voice). This is the post 'A.I.' Spielberg, the film-maker increasingly suspicious of himself and his art.If one ignores 'ET', 'Catch Me' is perhaps Spielberg's most autobiographical film (the director famously conned his way into, or rather conned us into believing that he conned his way into, a Universal Studios lot). All Spielberg's neuroses are presented (ie, a kid hiding in the fantasy world of cinema/con-artistry because his parents are divorcing), before the film eventually climaxes with Frank joining the FBI and using his powers of lying, forgery and imagination (aka his sweet film-making skills) for the 'greater good' of America. The film then ends with title cards which inform us that Frank stopped thousands of criminals, raised a large family (all sons!) and became a millionaire by creating unforgeable cheques. It's Spielberg's own trajectory from little Jewish outcast to millionaire do-goods-man, his filmography untouchable, unforgeable, but built on lies and forgery.Some cite the film as a critique of the 'American ethos', white collar America, and the hollow drive to 'please the father', 'get top jobs' and 'be all you can be'. But what the film really exemplifies is Spielberg's brand of confused, liberal humanism. The film's French authorities may be brutally indifferent, but America lets Americans act out, then, like a good daddy, rehabilitates them and brings them back home. FBI agent Tom Hanks, Frank's surrogate daddy, is after-all not a big mean G-man, but just another wounded guy looking for a son of his own. If daddy and son work and dream together, everyone will prosper.In this regard, Frank's motivations are completely ignored by Spielberg, who attribute them solely to 'divorce'. In reality, Frank's criminality stemmed from his father's own predicaments at the hands of the state (his inability to 'turn cream into butter', as he says in the film), predicaments which led to real-life Frank noticing the disparity between America's economic reality and its empty promises of success through 'unceasing hard work'. What Spielberg's film does is bashfully circle around this truth before presenting the opposite. Here, Frank's flights aren't a means of debarring his father's problems but of overcompensating for his father's failings as a scheming businessman, failings which Frank believes caused his evil wench of a mother to leave daddy. Work hard, be smarter and cleverer than daddy, and mommy won't leave. But remember to do this within the boundaries of the state, the law, otherwise you won't make millions and have a cool job and big family. The film's goody-goody conservatism, which a better director would have pushed to parody, is epitomised by a series of conversations towards its ending when Frank reiterates that he 'didn't cheat', that he 'studied and worked hard' and 'passed all his bar exams'. In other-words, selfishly conning people only sidetracked our hard working, talented Frank from his true potential, from America's true 'rugged individualism', true nature, and true work ethic. And if you do this as well, if you're an imaginative little guy who works within the boundaries like Frank/Spielberg, you too can be a zillion dollar high flier. Meanwhile, the film completely ignores the contempt con artists ordinarily have for their victims, for humanity in general, that pool of all-too-eager suckers.7.9/10 – Worth three viewings.

Schindler's List," Superficial, goofy exploitation film
","'Schindler's List is an exploitation film.' - David Mamet   'Schindler's List? Kitsch as fat as a dinosaur.' - Imre Kertesz  Steven Spielberg directs 'Schindler's List', a sentimental,  sensationalist film which has virtually nothing to do with the  Holocaust. But of course audiences never went to 'List' to think or  learn. This is a black and white horror film, providing shocks and  jolts and artfully constructed little moments of 'realistic' terror.  Audiences went for the same reason they went to see 'Jaws'. They wanted  to be shocked.   Spielberg takes the visual touchstones of the Holocaust,  (trains/showers/fences/chimneys etc) which audiences automatically  recognize, and then uses them to create little action set pieces. Will  the gas chambers work? Will the Nazi's find the girl? Will the sniper  let the woman live? Will the train stop? Will the little boy find a  hiding spot? Will the gun misfire? Will the hose be long enough? It's  like a silly game of pee-a-boo or whack-a-jew. The mindset also turns  up on a larger scale near the film's end, in a tasteless suspense scene  that mines thrills over whether the list will arrive in time to save  the Jews from getting gassed. And so on and so on.  People criticize the film for being morally black and white, for being  thoughtless, for its pantomime characters, for being Zionist propaganda  (the final scene is shocking in that it uses Nazism to suggest that  Israel is the only alternative to Jewish persecution), for presenting  'good' and 'evil' as being inexplicable (none of the characters  thoughts or motivations are explored) and ignoring all nuance, history  and politics. These criticisms are valid, but really, these people are  criticizing a film that 'List' never tried to be. It's a thriller. An  exploitative horror film disguised as art. That is the real immorality  of 'List'.  Unsurprisingly, Spielberg ignores all truths and instead opts to  propagate Western Holocaust myths. The fact that Goeth, who was  arrested by the SS Judiciary and imprisoned on charges of 'brutality  and sadism', was an anomaly and precisely the kind of figure of excess  that undermines and makes events like the Holocaust impracticable,  isn't brought up. Instead, with the exception of Schindler, all Germans  are portrayed as brutes. Schindler (whom modern historians - Jitka  Gruntova, David Crowe - don't regard as having altruistically saved  anyone) is himself Spielberg's typical father figure who slowly learns  to love his flock of children. Meanwhile, the film's Jews are reduced  to a slightly gentrified version of Der Sturmer caricatures: the  childish, initialized mass of holy innocents, the bespectacled  accountant, the dangerous Jewish seductress, the money men in the  church etc. Or, as Yosefa Loshitzky put it, they're strikingly 'similar  to their images in Nazi propaganda'.  Gone are all messy complexities. 'List' ignores the fact that the kapos  routinely conspired against fellow Jews, and that often only the  wealthiest could get on Schindler's list in the first place.  Schindler's history is wiped clean too (he used slave labor for most of  the war), as the fact that he worked for the Abwehr and procured the  Polish uniforms and information to be used in the Gleiwitz Incident,  the 'false flag' operation which was used as a pretext to start the  invasion of Poland, and therefore World War 2, is far too traumatic for  audiences who want neat cartoon demarcations. Western Anti-Semitism is  likewise shunted aside, Hitler's brand of Imperialism is never mirrored  to the equally insidious behavior of the other world Empires and the  fact that Hitler's war was the 'logical' outcome of early techno  capitalism and that all world powers were equally complicit in the  Holocuast, is ignored. Likewise, the way the West effectively  blackmailed (and abandoned) Poland and used them for a proxy war is  neglected as well as all manners of socio/political/historical  complexities. Schindler saved 1200 Jews you see. That's all that  matters. Turn off your brain. Shed a tear. Remember. Everything is  okay.  End result: WW2 and the Holocaust reduced to a kind of historical  brainwashing: 'evil Nazis kill cute Jews, good Nazi save some Jews,  debt paid if Jews allowed to keep Israel'. The film turns the Holocaust  solely into a Jewish experience. No one else suffers, nothing else  matters. Like 'Private Ryan', the film exploits the context of war and  deliberately lies in order to tell a fantasy of  rescue/survival/redemption. The real narrative subtext here is the  restoration of family and the recuperation of a nation and its history.  The boosting of comfortable myths and the avoidance of truthful  confrontation in order to provide superficial closure. In ignoring all  issues, it bolsters that which allow these problems to continually  repeat themselves.   Spielberg's optimism is correct, but he is wrong in placing the blame  on a failure of individuals and individual ethics/responsibility,  rather than the system itself. At their core, these are systemic,  ideological problems which continue to this day, and yet the film  condescendingly lets its audience pat itself on the back for believing  that it, like Schindler, would give up its riches to save lives. The  double-binds and compartmentalization which made and continues to make  such 'morality' impossible (as well as futile) are not shown. It's only  easy to say 'yes' to the film's ethical dilemmas when you're a wealthy  and powerful factory owning Nazi.   Unsurprisingly, the film takes the shape of a 'monster vs kids' ride,  the Nazi's becoming a surrogate for Spielberg's tripods/pirates/sharks/  dinosaurs/trucks. They zap Jews and you jump. Because 'List' has a  higher cum-shot-jew-kill ratio, all other Holocaust movies are obsolete  to salacious, contemporary taste buds. Other movies don't kill enough  people for them, don't give them that Hitchcockian buzz. Notice no one  went to see 'Amistad'. Spielberg didn't kill enough slaves. He learnt  his lesson with 'Ryan', though, and dispatched a couple thousand Nazis  for your amusement. Self-congratulation sells best with blood.  7/10",Null,2,8,13 August 2011
