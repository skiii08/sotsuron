The Lobster," Does Anything Matter?
","I'm not sure if nihilism has ever been better reproduced in a film. The film begins, meanders along, does some murders, and then it's over. Was anything gained? Was anything lost? I'm not sure. But it's darkly funny and hilarious in every way. I wish more movies would feel this free to take leaps as it explores its singularly vicious world.",9,3,3,21 April 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Not very good
",Messy plot. Inconsistent characters and overall an unsatisfying ending to an otherwise well-made trilogy.,4,26,41,21 April 2020
The Men Who Stare at Goats," It has some fun bits
","Kevin Spacey being one something really takes me out of it and now that affects all the movies I watch with him. The rest of the cast is fun but the execution is sloppy and it tries to be a Coen brothers movie but is not witty enough or put together well enough for that to work. Love Jeff Bridges in this though, all the actors are good and put in solid performances but the movie is a bit of a dud.",6,1,1,21 April 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," For Those Who Felt Like the Avengers Wasn't 'It'
","This movie was everything the Avengers was not and that is... extremely fun, exciting, well-paced, and spectacular. I don't think the Avengers was as good as everyone else seems to believe, that's not saying I hate it, I just don't think it's that great. Now before you shoot me down and block me, hear me out.Guardians of the Galaxy is a story that isn't so much about story as it is about developing the quirkiest, funnest, and most interesting characters that Marvel has to offer. Anyone who thought Captain America and Hawkeye were bland and boring in the Avengers, look no further. (I will frequently compare the Avengers and Guardians). Each character is given enough development in the first half that they aren't just caricatures. Each person is given enough dialogue and none of them seem to mugging for the screen.I haven't even gotten to the best part. THE SOUNDTRACK!! This soundtrack is better than Frozen, better than Avengers, better than Iron Man. When you leave this movie you will be whistling 'Hooked on a Feeling' or chuckling to yourself about the opening credits scene or singing Jackson 5's 'I Want You Back' or possibly even thinking about Marvin Gaye's 'Ain't No Mountain High Enough'. The soundtrack pushed this movie into such a silliness and over the top fun that it was incredibly enjoyable to watch. Now I haven't really said anything bad about this film because there isn't much wrong with it. Except it suffers from being a Marvel film, so, the villain is only meh. Marvel struggles so bad with villains that it's almost sad. The villain in Guardians is not terrible but he's no Joker or Gene Hackman's Lex Luthor or even Loki. The villain is forgettable and not well developed and that's a definite drawback. In short, Guardians of the Galaxy is the most fun I've had at the movies in a long time, it's exciting and wacky, its soundtrack is phenomenal, and its villain is underwhelming.Highly Recommended.",9,1,6,1 December 2014
Shrek 2," Shrek 1 is better
","Too anyone who has regard this argument. Shrek II is not as good as original recipe Shrek. Original recipe Shrek is amazing and brilliant. Shrek II lacks the beauty, the grace, and the simplicity of the wonderfully creative Shrek 1.",7,0,0,21 April 2020
Avatar," 10/10 Visually. 1/10 Originality. Come on James Cameron
","The first thing I ever heard about Avatar was it was amazing, a must see, the greatest movie ever made. Well, the first thing I heard was wrong. The movie had loads of entrancing visuals with fine acting, generic characters, a lacking script and an already old, recycled, generic and plain unoriginal storyline.The first thing I mentioned was the visuals, which were as stunning as you've heard. The gigantic budget for this surely must have added something to this awesome spectacle. After watching the movie I felt like the only redeeming quality was the visuals which is why I gave the movie a 4.Second, the acting. The acting was passable. Just like the acting in Transformers, I wouldn't go into this movie expecting Oscar-caliber acting. Sigourney Weaver was the high point considering most of the acting was by the CGI it just wasn't impressive. When all your acting is done by animators it's hard not to notice the lack of acting the movie has.Third, generic characters. Most James Cameron movies have characters that are interesting and more than one dimensional these are a bit of a let-down. You have complete cardboard cut-out type characters that don't seem to have any layers besides good-guy and bad-guy. No character is a wild card like Han Solo or Hannibal Lecter. These characters were not simply a one or two word definition these characters were complex and had conflicts and such. But not so with the characters in here.Fourth, a lacking script. Cheap dialogue. While dialogue isn't everything it certainly is nice to have great dialogue such as Dr. Strangelove. The dialogue is a bit generic and unoriginal.The blow that kills the movie more than any of its wounds. The awful storyline. While not only ripping off every movie pro-environment it doesn't change anything. It should be title Dances with Wolves 2: Blue Space Indians. The Näví are just blue Native Americans with less clothing. Starting with the white guy who is coming to a new place and is shown the ropes. He gets accepted into the tribe of whatever and realizes the other white people are bad people and he must help the tribe because white people don't listen to anybody but themselves. White people=bad except for the random white guy in the crowd who helped them out. Also, the one girl who is a little sketchy of the white guy at first ends up falling in love with him stupid clichè. The end is some stupid battle where white people with technology get killed by the tribe using bows and arrows and rocks. Yep, that's totally original it doesn't sound like any other movie I've ever seen (sarcasm). Dances with Wolves was a far better movie than this pro-environmental trash. In recap, this movie is completely bland tasting but has a delicious feast for the eyes. Good special effects don't make a movie. Look at Transformers 1, 2 or 3.An intriguing plot, good characters and good acting make a great movie. For stunning visuals and these other qualities I'd suggest Life of Pi, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Pacific Rim (acting was again passable in Pacific Rim's case). Avatar was a complete let down and completely unoriginal.",4,6,10,22 September 2013
Rocky," Beautiful, low key movie
","This movie takes a very understated view of its protagonist and its story. The magic of this movie is the moments between the 'moments'. Rocky's face as Adrian doesn't look at him. His trainer's last look at the bathroom that Rocky disappeared into. The people that populate this movie feel real. Rocky is authentically lacking the finesse that makes the following movies so gloriously cheesy (here's looking at you IV). What we have in this is a flawed character, built from the Philadelphia soul that framed him, shaped by the brutality of poverty, undercut by internalized misogyny, but, ultimately, a caring, good-hearted man who wants to be somebody. One of the greatest sports movies ever made.",10,0,0,21 April 2020
