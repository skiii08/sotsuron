Scarface," Say good night to the bad guy.
","A must see. One of Al Pacino's greatest performances as Tony Montana,the Cuban gangster in search of the American Dream. From the opening shots of Castro's eviction of 250,000 unwanted Cubans to its climactic ending,'Scarface' portrays a roller coaster ride through Miami's cocaine world,a thrilling look at the rise and fall of Tony,and the excesses of 80s materialism.  The anti-hero Montana is someone with whom we can identify with, because the movie questions how far we are willing to go in order to gain 'the world'. Director Brian DePalma and Screen writer Oliver Stone create the perfect gangster film, but the real credit goes to Pacino's superb performance-'Say hello to my little friend!'",9,0,0,12 May 2000
Casualties of War," Tragic and haunting
","While not as good a Vietnam movie as Platoon or Apocalypse Now, Casualties of War nevertheless delivers the emotional punch through DePalma's depiction of how war can truly bring out the worst in people. Similar in content to the village massacre scene of Platoon, Casualties actually hits home with greater force the horrific conduct and depravity of how low these GIs had been morally reduced to. You almost cringe at certain scenes such as Corporal Clark's callous crooning of The Door's 'Hello, I love you' while escorting their victim on the march. By being able to fully empathize with Erikson, we feel appauled and helpless as we witness his uncontrolable situation, and can't but help feel a bitter satisfaction when he lays into one of the soldiers with a shovel back at base camp. I felt angry and depressed at how any human being could act the way these soldiers did, and was haunted long after the movie's conclusion.                            Based on a true story, we realize the true tragedy of what has occurred at the movie's end, when Erikson returns to the present from his flashback and the girl suggets that he had had a 'bad dream'. The painful reality is that it wasn't just a dream, anymore than the whole Vietnam War was.                                                                 DePalma examines in great depth not just the ethics concerning warfare, but the values of right and wrong & good and evil, which every single one of us on this planet faces. Just as in Platoon with Charlie Sheen's concluding helicopter voiceover, and Saving Private Ryan's portrayal of the aged Ryan asking his wife 'have I been a good man, have I led a good life?', Casualties of War highlights a similar concept when Erikson states that one should never abandon their sense of morality-to cease caring- just because they are surrounded by the possibility of death. Overall you are left with a harrowing feeling that is akin to the likes of having watched Schindler's List or The Killing Fields.",8,24,29,29 January 2001
Platoon," Emotional powerhouse of a movie.
","Perhaps one of the most realistic 'Nam movies ever to emerge. I think what really astounded me was the sheer brilliance of the depicted nightmarish battle scenes. But what is especially appealing about 'Platoon', I think, is the way in which Stone deglamourises war,while simultaneously giving the viewer an exhilarating, claustrophobic, and ultimately cathartic experience.In turn I felt both thrilled and horrified, emotionally evoked and saddened.  Particularly moving scenes,to name a few, which the viewer can never forget, include the village, Elias' death, and the apocalyptic ending- when the perimeter is overrun. The acting too is top class. Charlie Sheen's Taylor gives a credible performance as Stone's alter ego, but especial praise must go to Tom Berenger's depiction of the war scarred Barnes, and  Willem Defoe's sensitive Elias, as well as supporting roles, such as Kevin Dillon's sadistic Bunny, and Chris' big brotherly Keith David as King,all make up the tragedy and horror that was Vietnam. Put simply-A movie I WILL NEVER FORGET for as long as I live.",9,0,0,11 April 2000
