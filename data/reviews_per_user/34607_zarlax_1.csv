The New World," Without Compromise
","I am sincerely befuddled that any serious devotee of cinema can find a significant blemish in the construction of this film. Obviously, his sense of movement and characterization require a certain tolerance for abstraction, but I have rarely seen art in any medium come so close to perfection. All of Malick's cinematic work has been masterful, yet without any doubt his prowess and technique have only blossomed further with each additional effort. Thoroughly, I respect the impatience of many viewers and the subsequent lack of interest regarding the film's exposition and mechanics. However, it is important to differentiate and qualify the criticism of those who are unable to maintain focus from those who actively commit to the experience. Malick will never be as traditionally engaging as more entertainment-oriented directors, but this notion holds no sway over the quality present in his work; the supreme control with which he commands his faculties is astounding and permeates every aspect of 'The New World'. In fact, when considering the level of detail inherent in the film's production it is impressive how naturalistic the film appears. Generally artists lose important aspects of expression in the cultivation of execution, which thereby results in a lack of warmth and soul; thankfully, Malick is seemingly immune to this affliction and created his most intimate and gentle film yet. Other great directors like Kubrick and Lynch have wrestled with the same inverse proportionality in their films. However, both of these men opted to utilize this human detachment for a more disassociated perspective, whereas Malick maintains balance through subtly incisive introspection. It is this delicate thread of understated reflection that binds all elements of his craft into a tapestry of unmatched beauty. The screenplay is simply poetic. I recommend the use of subtitles to those with the inability to hear, or perhaps listen. Attentiveness is paramount. The film is ultimately a soft-spoken essay in perception, revolving around the juxtaposition of culture: co-existence, conquest, and the journey between natural and human order. Deceptively enough, all this is packaged in the context of a historical romance revolving around Pocahontas and her pair of European suitors. Nevertheless, it still succeeds in being one of the better statements concerning love, regret, and the embrace of life ever artificially produced. The design elements and performances committed to film are astounding and the cinematography and editing are unmatched in the pantheon of contemporary American cinema. Ostensibly, this film is a barrage of intricately tempered sight and sound. For admirers of Malick these traits are to be expected, but many casual movie-watchers may understandably find the more overtly poetic elements of the production to be detrimental and irreconcilably distracting. The film is undeniably nebulous with an abstract narrative structure and a disorienting pace, but given careful attention and most likely repeat viewings 'The New World' will reveal itself in its true form: a masterpiece.",10,0,1,26 April 2008
