Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3
","The suit breaks way too much in iron Man 3 it is as if the writers and director never saw the previous iron man movies or the avengers. Tony Stark is only in his suit about 10 min. in the whole movie and every time he puts on a suit it is broken off in about 5 seconds. A truck is able to completely knock the suit off in this movie and a little boy is able to pull of the finger of the suit. In the previous iron man movies it shows the supremacy of the iron man suit by being hit by a missile and not having a mark, being hit by Thor's mighty hammer and THors lightening and withstanding the damage as well as a long fight against alien creatures in the Avengers. It was if the suit was made of plastic in iron man 3 it was ripped off so easily. I think he went through at least 40 suits in the movie.",4,3,6,4 May 2013
