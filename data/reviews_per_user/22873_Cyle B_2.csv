The Blair Witch Project," Please stop whining!!
","Ohh pleeeeease stoooop whiiiiining!!  I can understand they're scared, but come on.  If I was one of them I would have killed the other two.  It's a good story and the way it is shot was cool, but I couldn't get past the whining.  Your lost in the woods where you heard a witch lives.  OK.  Get the hell out.  Pick a direction and go.  Just don't whine so much!!",3,0,1,22 September 1999
The Thin Red Line," This movie is weak. It's 170 minutes of your life you can't get back!!
",I watched this movie waiting for something to happen.  It didn't!  It kills me to think that with the talent they had available it was such a weak movie.  No real story.  No flow.  Save the time and do something more important with it like counting the number of leaves on a tree.  You'll have a much better time!,Null,0,1,15 September 1999
