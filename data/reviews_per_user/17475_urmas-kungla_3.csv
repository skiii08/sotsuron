The Monuments Men," It had intentions of a good movie but couldn't play it out at all for me
","This is truly disappointing movie. I was waiting for comedy like dramatic war movie but it actually failed in every single part of it.I think they didn't even plan to put war scenes into that although there were some parts of dramatic moments which, again, failed to bring it to me personally. If I could watch this movie again (which I will not) then just maybe I would be able to pick one or two scenes that was worth ticket price. It had many small stories which weren't connected to each other too well. It had intentions of a good move but couldn't play it out at all for me.The only thing that I actually liked about that movie was to see WWII landscapes and life they lived and also it reminded me of the horrors that Nazi Germany back then initiated. Big group of good actors will not make a good movie if the story line fails.",4,2,2,25 February 2014
The Equalizer," Bad guy's horror (may contain some spoilers)
","This movie begins like an average Hollywood 'bad past, new beginning lost to new bad' and at first seems like an average one guy movie.What it really was for me was a movie that pulled me off from my everyday average simple jet lucky and easy life. Reminded me of some of the real world out there and then put one guy in the middle of it and that again reminded me that it was a movie.By heart, really a good guy. Judge buy action then.. not that good, I guess. I mean it wasn't simple shoot and kill movie. If you would see the movie from the bad guy's perspective, it would rather be a horror movie. They way it all went down..Anyhow.. certainly a worth watch although at times it was a bit over pushed. The way that one guy brings all the horror on all the bad guys... Don't watch if you can't stand bloody horror movies.",8,0,5,16 December 2014
Nightcrawler," Aargh.. this move made me feel anxious and disturbed! But I loved it...
","Jake Gyllenhaal's obsessive character was awfully disturbing!!! I hated him from the beginning and he made me feel very anxious. Disturbing indeed.But you know what? This is what this character was all about. I hated him but at the same time I felt for him. I have to say that for me this was by far the best played part for Jake Gyllenhaal. Respect! Now I want to see all of his movies.. :)The way this movie crabs you into it without asking your permission and keeps your blood pressure up, makes you feel uncomfortable, anxious, troubled. Is this all ethical? Would you do it? Would I do it? How did the news really made the big screen today? What was the... you'll have to see the movie for that.Anyhow. Few plot holes here and there regarding well respected law enforcement but if you can look past it you'll like it as the point wasn't them, it was him, the awesome character of Jake Gyllenhaal's.My friend bought the ticket, I only knew the name of the movie and it was awesome! Make your friend a gift and take him/ her to the movies without telling what it is that's showing tonight!Awesome indeed, 9 out of 10 for sure. It will make you think!DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER! Really! It may spoil the movie for you.",9,1,2,13 January 2015
