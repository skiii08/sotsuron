Ford v Ferrari," Maybe the best 2019 Hollywood could offer
","++ Oh boy what a fantastic heart pumping thrilling movie! Christian Bale I love you man! Matt Damon we can always rely on you!
++ The way Bale delivered the script where talks about cars really excited me, because it is the same way I talk about cameras and image processing. It takes a deep passion to feel for a tool in that way, so the character of Ken Miles really touched me to the core.
++ There is an overarching theme of loving what you do and in contrast doing something for the sake of selling throughout the movie. Loved that moral battle.
-- OK cinematography but it won't matter because the acting and attention to detail in set design makes up for it.",10,1,1,7 February 2020
Joker," Did we Really Need the Character Re-imagined?
","I liked the movie, but this is not a masterpiece. It's overrated. The movie is actually quite soft, not the kind of people getting sick after watching this. These are all part of a marketing plan. Anyway, I didn't like the version of the Joker they created. It is unfair towards the original character.

Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Disappointing, but it could have been so much better!
","The Joker played a cameo role of Lex Luthor. Luthor is such a strong villain so much more than joker, but they thought making him more like joker they would make more money. Totally destroyed the character.Funny to see batman contradict his own code while pursuing superman and the contradiction is the very thing that led him to stand against the big guy!Even funnier to see both of the heroes giving up their moral at the slightest chance. Where the only thing that sets them apart from evil is their moral itself.The entire plot and the plot reversal lacks motivation. Without motivation, everything seemed pointless conflict in this movie. Did they try to rip off Doomsday as Hulk on steroids? This was not the real doomsday at all. In fact, doomsday was not created like this.Never should have chosen Ben Affleck in the first place.The only thing right about this movie was Wonder Woman's character, exactly how she fights ruthlessly. But still, her entry in to the plot is quite quite abnormal. She shouldn't have been there. Overall a tamil movie. Martha! (Tamil (Indian sub genre) movies are highly melodramatic and illogical)In the original story, Batman dies. It was a clever decision to kill Superman and present something new to the audience.But still in every possible instance of Superman being dead-ish, he was never buried on Earth. Either he was destroyed or his body was launched towards the Sun (because it makes sense).Another good thing of the movie is the birth of Bruce Wayne as Batman. Very beautifully presented metaphoric scenes from his childhood.If you want to see a real Batman vs Superman movie, go and see the animated one. Perfect in every possible way.",6,2,4,1 April 2016
