Raiders of the Lost Ark," Why I Love Raiders
","I think out of any film ever to be released Raiders of the Lost Ark has had the biggest impact on my life. I was born years after it was released but I have seen this film more times than years I've been alive.I love Raiders because ticks every single box. Firstly, because it has to be dealt with, Harrison Ford is one sexy man. I do not know any woman who would disagree with that statement and I do not know any man who wouldn't want to be him. Harrison Ford just has IT. The thought that Richard from Friends (Tom Selleck) could have been known as Indy is horrifying and well to be honest thank god for Magnum PI.Now, I am a sucker for a romance story in a film. I don't really like soppy sort of love films but I love a good old romance embedded in a decent story. Oh and Raiders does this beautifully! Marion Ravenwood, firstly, is the BEST Indy girl and personally the best female character from a film. This is because I want to be her I suppose. She's been heartbroken; she's ended up opening a seedy bar in Nepal and then finally gets her man. What I love about Marion is that she's a strong woman, she holds her own against Indy but you know she's a woman, she wants to be loved and Karen Allen is a fabulous and beautiful actress who makes Indy's and Marion's relationship real and well pretty lovely to be honest.OK, so Raiders has Harrison and it has the great relationship between Indy and Marion but let's not forget Raiders in an adventure film. I think all my ambitions to want to do history and all that rubbish is down to this film. OK, I know its not real life and I know the whole ark thing is rubbish but all I can ever think for weeks after it is how brilliant it would be if I could go on that adventure. But it's not only an adventure film, I've already said about the lovely romance, but you know it has so much more than just an adventure to it.Finally of course it's a Spielberg and Lucas film and really that says it all.I love Raiders, it's a shame Temple of Doom didn't live up to it, although I must say Temple of Doom does have the best opening to any film ever. Luckily, though The Last Crusade did and all in all I cannot wait for Kingdom.",10,2,4,15 May 2008
Juno," Quite Good
","Firstly ill start with a little criticism, that is that i just thought the whole film had an air of trying to hard. The script was really over-written and some of the conversations just didn't seem natural. Which confused me when I saw the film because after all the praise Diablo Cody has been receiving, I really didn't think it lived up to the hype.Other than that i really enjoyed the film. It was amusing and very touching. The acting was brilliant, Ellen Page was of course great but I really liked Jennifer Garner in this film. And Juno's parents gave the best laughs.All in all a good, amusing film, even if it does try a bit too hard.",6,3,9,16 February 2008
