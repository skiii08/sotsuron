The King's Speech," Missing a little touch that could quite simply make it the best British film in years...
","Having seen reviews declaring it the 'best film of the year' and the film which will 'sweep the Oscars', I decided that I would, with my parents, go to see Tom Hooper's 'The King's Speech'. As with many hyped and essentially overrated films, I came out a little disappointed. I felt there was something missing from the film for it to deserve as much praise as it had received. As of yet, I have not quite put my finger on it. I originally perceived the screenplay to be perhaps a little too clich√©d and unoriginal before remembering that it is a factual docudrama on King George VI and his battle to 'gain a voice'. Eventually I decided that I wasn't going to see a Stanley Kubrick film or, in other words, something both weird and wonderful. Instead, I had gone to see a fantastic period drama with fantastic performances from almost all of it's cast.Maybe I had tried to look for too many little gems having already found two in the performance from Collin Firth and its cinematography from Danny Cohen. Other notable praise should be given to Helena Bonham Carter (perhaps a career best) and Geoffrey Rush who both outshone many of their previous performances and roles. Despite such fantastic acting and imagery, a little nagging feeling deep withing me warns me not to praise this film as one of the greatest of this decade or to perhaps overrate. Nonetheless, The King's Speech is so far the best contender for the Academy Awards (I have yet to view True Grit) far surpassing any film of 2010. Ultimately with fantastic performances from its leading cast and stunningly brilliant Cinematography, The King's Speech is a triumphant period drama with perhaps a little something missing robbing it of the title of 'Modern Mastepiece'.",9,2,3,9 January 2011
Fargo," Perhaps the most bizarre and absurd films you'll ever see. For me that's a guarantee you'll love it.
","Finally breaking through into 'mainstream' audiences, the Coen Brothers skillfully woven comedy, Fargo, tells the tale of a man's desperate attempt to bring himself out of the severe financial problems he has encountered. Jerry Lundergard, played by William H. Macy, decides that the best way to fix this problem his to have his wife abducted and his father in law to pay the ransom. However, as with all Coen Films, not all goes to plan. Directly from the beginning we are made aware that Jerry's decision to hire two criminals, characterised by their lack of agreement on anything, will result in dire consequences. As the film draws to it's end, we're left with the dead bodies of Jerry's wife, her Father, a Police Officer, two witnesses and one of the two would-be criminals. For me though, it's not the story, although written beautifully by both Coens, but the performances of Frances McDormand, William H. Macy and Steve Buscemi; all three of which have yet to have been bested. Fargo tells not only of the tale and ultimate downfall of greed, but also the fantastic quirky story of Marge Olmstead-Gunderson (Frances McDormand)in her quest to both catch the two criminals and her husbands stamp interest. Surely one of the best films of the nineties if not of all time.",10,1,2,29 December 2010
Pulp Fiction," An intelligently woven tale of crime life in a world that can 'Only exist in the Movies'
","Having triumphed with his Reservoir Dogs, Quentin Tarantino soon began work on his second feature film: Pulp Fiction. Set in a world that only Mr. Tarantino himself could imagine, Pulp Fiction tells the tale of small time organised crime. Beginning fantastically with the electric and meaty dialogue of Pumkin and Honeybunny, played be Tim Roth and Amanda Plummer, Pulp Fiction's opening Diner scene acts as a prelude to the crescendo that soon follows. The characters of both Vincent Vega and Jules Winnfield, played skillfully by John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson, soon become modern day cinema catalysts for the punchy and fast dialogue that inspired a generation of young filmmakers. Tarantino's masterpiece is concluded with standout performances from Uma Thurman and Harvey Keitel, ensuring that Pulp Fiction became one of the most significant films of the nineties if not of all time.",10,0,1,29 December 2010
Trainspotting," An electrically charged homage to British pop culture.
","At initial glance, Trainspotting, dealing with somewhat rather controversial issues, seems horrendously sickening. Despite this, taking Trainspotting for what it is, Danny Boyle's second venture into the world of film seems rather uplifting and invigorating despite the somewhat macabre storyline. Clearly making references and paying tribute to many independent pioneers of pop cultural ladened films, it surprised me to discover that Trainspotting is in fact based on the novel of the same name. Despite such a fresh and promising film, Trainspotting when examined under close scrutiny seems rather unextraordinary. Although performances from most of the cast are rather nice, with special praise going to Ewan McGreggor and Robert Carlyle, the storyline still seems to be rather void of any life; it instead has to rely upon it's pop cultural references and controversial themes to keep both the plot and its audience plodding along nicely. Trainspotting is ultimately a fantastic homage to all things, admittedly not the best selection, British. It's because of this, and with some rather nice camera work, that the audience deems it acceptable to look over any minor errors that stop this film from becoming a brilliant piece of British cinema.",9,2,2,1 January 2011
