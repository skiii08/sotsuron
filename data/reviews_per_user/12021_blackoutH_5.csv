Ford v Ferrari," The review score goes for the one and only Christian Bale
","As a big Christian Bale fan, once more I cannot find words that describe this man's acting skills and the effort he puts in each role he performsBale is as always amazing, and clearly a snub for this year's Oscars as a nomination was absolutely deserved, taking Phoenix (Joker) out of the equation, this was by far the best performance of the yearWith that being said, this is the only reason I gave a somehow a good review score, that, and the friendship / chemistry with Matt Damon's character.
Their story is emotional and although I am not a fan of the theme, I've seen plenty movies that depict areas that are none of my interest, but they still deliverThis wasn't the case, it is suppose to convey the message of how corporations interfere with humanity, but you still gasp some BS nationalism and patriotism, which I have always found ridiculous, specially when it comes to big companiesThank you Bale for another delivery, hopefully I will be seeing you collaborating in the future with Nolan once again so that your acting matches his out of this world movies!",7,0,0,1 February 2020
Interstellar," For the Sci-Fi lovers? No, for movie lovers and for the truth seekers...
","First of all let me just congratulate my favorite movie director Christopher Nolan, for making another masterpiece and for making the Hollywood industry a far better place. Before I address this movie, let me tell you this, Nolan is an acclaimed director not only for the public in general, but also to their fellow colleagues in the industry (yes i'm talking about the big names, such as Guillermo del Toro, Soderberg, Spielberg, and so o ..). Sorry for the cold statement but his movies are not for everyone, they are complex, they are twisted, but above all this things, they all feel so real... I don't know how to begin this review but between the outstanding soundtrack by the genius Hans Zimmer, the breathtaking scenes such as the wormhole and the black hole or the twists alongside the movie, I got to tell you, you will travel while watching, and you will be flooded with extreme doses of excitement.Nolan cares about every detail, all the special effects, the casting is always amazing and of course the originality of the plot is astonishing.. The sound is thrilling, Hans Zimmer takes you to another planet with strong and inspirational songs that perfectly match the scenes and of course, the message of the strenght of the humane nature to survive is strongly delivery to us, the audience.. 'Don't go gently to that good night' - Brilliant!!For the haters: Some of the locations of the movie Interstellar are real, they went to Iceland to film some of the scenes, to all criticizing the effects on Dr.Mann's planet, there are no effects, it's freaking Iceland! Get your facts straight! It makes me sick how the so called 'critics' review this movie, I'm not a professional movie critic, if exists such a thing, but how do you even compare Gravity to Interstellar??? For God's sake, Gravity has some nice CGI and a reasonable story but zero content, I learned nothing from the movie, not a touching message or some scientific facts, just special effects and George Cloney, seriously? Interstellar not only gives an original story, with twists that will give some headaches but also some knowledge, complex knowledge translated so the 'normal' minds can understand it, and gives all this with such an amount of reality and incredible acting and sound editing that it is a crime to give even an average review. And if you don't understand the movie just say it, and don't start giving low rates because of that..I kind of get why some of the criticism was negative, I guess even the professional ones are struggling to understand the movie, so in order to look like good intellectuals they make themselves superiors and give the low rating. Don't listen to them, the 9 on IMDb spears for itself..Hollywood needs Nolan, thank you for making this kind of movies!Sorry for the English I had much more to say but its hard to fully express yourself if its not your native languageCheers!",10,1,8,25 November 2014
The Lion King," Another one for them to hate...
","'It's exactly like the original, nothing new'
'It's nothing like the original, they took so many important parts'I think we can figure out the origin of bad reviews, ridiculous expectations, and inconsistency, as all sources of badThe movie is stunning, technically, and the story is what you saw when you were a kid, with a slight pinch of realism. Sit back and enjoy!",10,3,11,24 July 2019
1917," Elevating cinema
","It's movies like this that make me appreciate the creative minds in cinema!On a saturated topic, Sam Mendes creates an experience, that for two hours takes to an immersive 'single shot' adrenaline pumped journey of two soldiers during one of the harshest periods of modern historyInspired by the stories told by his grandfather, Mendes proves that great movies transcend genres and topics.Deserving of all the award buzz, no doubt!!",9,5,8,24 January 2020
Joker," It's brilliance, swop critic's head - It's not subtil, and it doesn't need to be
","I usually write reviews on amazing movie experiences or if my perception of the movie is the opposite of the so called critics.This time is both!I don't think I need to point out anything for Joaquin's performance, Oscar worthy, brilliant, at the same level as Heath, even though the comparison is really inglorious, since this is a standalone movieNow for the movie itself, above all, I believe it conveys a really strong message which most of us would like to ignore, which is the suffering and complications with intense mental disorders.
I am not an American national, but I've been there several times, and I strongly believe that not only, there is still a heavy stereotype for this individuals, but also, given the current social/economic reality, not enough has been done for those who carry this traumas.And while the movie explores this, it doesn't compromise the infamous villain story, it actually brings a wider perspective on his motives and behavior, and how he reached the downward spiral we all witnessed in the Dark KnightI am also not a fan of a specific component of the story line, which they used to cause more impact, I won't spoil it, let's just say they could have used any other character to convey the exact same message.Aside from that, overall it's an intense, dark, bold movie, which contrary to critics mention of bringing nothing new, it actually does.
No it's not a ripoff of Taxi Driver, inspired? Maybe, but if you indeed compare it, I actually believe Joker provides even more in depth to the psychology of the character as well as way more context.It's not subtil, and it doesn't need to be",10,1,1,11 October 2019
