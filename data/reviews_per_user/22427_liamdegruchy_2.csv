Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Jack is back and better than ever!
","Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) is back in this fourth instalment of the Pirtaes of the Caribbean franchise. Along side some old friends such as Captain Barbossa (Geoffry Rush)and his old first mate Gibbs, and some new faces such as the beautiful and sassy Angelica (Penelope Cruz)and frighting legend of a pirate that is Blackbeard. (Ian McShane) This troublesome tale sees' Jack go on a voyage to the fountain of youth. Might I say how wonderful it is to have Jack back on our screens, Johnny Depp once again portrays the unique character brilliantly and yes at sometimes it is a bit repetitive but it leads to great comedy moments and entertainment for all. Of course the movie could not beat what has come before such as the pirates first movie, but it lived up to be a great instalment to the franchise. Surprisingly I didn't feel the need for the old characters we all thought we would so desperately miss such as Elizzebeth Swan and Will Turner. Instead this movie had it's own stamp on the effect that it gave the audience and it is well worth a watch and a purchase in the future. Reviewed by Liam de Gruchy",8,1,2,2 June 2011
Thor," Amusing and talented!!!
","Thor was a fun movie with the right balance between action, comedy and character focus. With Chris Hemsworth playing the some might say overlay buffed up Thor who is banished from his land by his Father and lands on earth. His performance is well worth a credit as his character must adapt to the new world he is in and Hemsworth does this well.Natalie Portman gives an amazing performance as Jane foster the scientist who takes in Thor is part of some hilarious moments but also dramatic and exciting scenes that you expect. The director does really well in again keeping the balance in the entire film! The story and the twists and turns in the film really gripped me the most with your typical good guys to bad and your ultimate battle between man and beast that captivates you throughout! Well worth a watch!",9,2,5,29 April 2011
