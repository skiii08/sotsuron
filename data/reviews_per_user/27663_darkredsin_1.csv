Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A Bore-fest
","I was expecting something good from this movie but instead I got a very boring movie with very little action for a 'vampire movie'. The script was badly written,very amateurish.I'm so surprised that I made it to the end of the movie.I nearly turned it off a couple of times,especially by 1hour into the movie but I decided to stick it out to the end.You would think with how much these so called big productions cost that the writer would have put more effort into the script.But again I guess somethings are just asking too much.In-fact the B-Movie 'Infestation' was more exciting than AL:VH.OK it had some interesting parts but few and far between.Hey;there's more plot and action in an episode from 'Buffy The Vampire Slayer' than there was in this over-priced movie!!Sorry but sometimes the truth hurts and some people are easily entertained,but that isn't me anymore;I expect quality and this just wasn't it!!",1,4,9,9 July 2012
