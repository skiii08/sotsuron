The King's Speech," The King's Speech: Not just a film for history buffs
","Each year there comes a handful of British films that are so stuffy and so annoyingly high brow, that it would seem one would have to have obtained their PhD in English Lit. (emphasis on the works of Monty Python) to understand anything happening on screen; 'The King's Speech' is not one of those films. Directed in epic format by Tom Hooper (The Damned United), Colin Firth (A Single Man) and Geoffrey Rush (Pirates of the Caribbean: the Curse of the Black Pearl) star in the true story of King George VI, who turned to a radical speech therapist to overcome his stutter. It may not sound like the most intriguing premise in the world, but Hooper and this sublime cast make it one of the most engaging and powerful films of the year.Firth is absolutely memorizing as King George VI, having total command of his every mannerism as well as that trademark stutter. Firth should easily win a Golden Globe, as well as an Oscar, as well as the 'Movies With Markus Award' (hopefully a real thing one day) for best leading actor in a dramatic role. His performance in 'The King's Speech' is undoubtedly the best acting performance of the year (mark my words)! And no, I didn't forget about Helena Bonham Carter (Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street), who gives a truly royal performance as Queen Elizabeth.Side note: Even though this may not be the best film of the year, this will undoubtedly win the best picture for the Golden Globes (Don't ask. It's politics). So if you are the betting type MPAA, what is going on with your rating system?!: Why does this film hold an R rating? Because of TWO scenes depicting intense language (all pertaining to King George VI's speech therapy mind you). That is a shame, for when it's all said and done, 'The Kings Speech' is an historic/educational film that has been cut off from a wider audience because of a few F bombs. I guess hearing the F word is more detrimental to anyone under 17, than watching a person blow another persons brains out. What does that say about American society? Anyways Final Thought: This film can only be described as a magnificent endeavor of British film-making. With much of the same dramatic luster of British films such as 'The Queen' and 'Atonement', 'The Kings Speech' will go down as a film classic and (need I say it) a must see this awards season. This film is nothing short of one of the best films of the year!

Despicable Me 2," A Comedy for Small Children
","Standing as one of the most uninteresting protagonists to grace the world of animation in the past few years, my only question is: who really cares about Gru? And after watching 'Despicable Me 2', I can't for the life of me figure out why the original even merited this sequel if the character of Gru was going to continue to be at the helm. Expecting to see a story about the reformed villain Gru (voiced by Steve Carell) 'getting back into the game' (by which I mean being recruited by the Anti-Villain League (creative name I know) in order to help with the capture of the next super villain bent on world domination) but instead getting a throw-away love story, with forced sentimentality and a final battle sequence which comes up terribly short.OK, so if you know me then you understand that I don't care for the Minions. But I do get why small children enjoy their incoherent babbling and slapstick antics. And the youngest girl in these films is one of the cutest animated characters outside of any Pixar film. But again, I don't get the appeal of Gru outside of the well conceived plot of the original, which took a lot of people by surprise and which I even gave a positive review to.Synopsis: Watch Gru make silly faces, watch the cute kid be cutesy, but most of all watch the Minions beat each other senseless. This entire movie seems to be the result of a focus group that when asked what they enjoyed most about the first movie responded with a resounding: MINIONS! And so that's essentially what we get here, Minions at every turn. But as the most annoying part of the original, in small doses said Minions had been tolerable. But when said Minions appear in nearly every scene (as they do here) in conjunction with the relentless Minion-centric trailers we all had to sit though lo these past few months, 'Despicable Me 2' only becomes more tiresome as it moves forward. Well, unless you wanted to see a Minions movie. And honestly, that is what many fans of the original are going to buy a ticket expecting to see. So, what do I know? Highlights: There is one funny character in this movie and it's not Kristen Wiig, who voices Lucy, an agent of the Anti-Villain League and the only character more annoying than the Minions. Clearly the best character in 'Despicable Me 2' goes by the name of El Macho (voiced by Benjamin Bratt). But between this character, the little girl being cutesy and the two Minion covers of well known songs during the finale which is sure to get a rise out of audiences, the overall entertainment factor is still low if you are going into this film not a Minions apologist.Side Note: Do you know why the Minions aren't funny? Because their style of physical comedy is not at all clever. In fact, I don't believe their style of comedy is meant to be clever, but instead bait cheap laughs. For example: Have you ever seen a grown man hit himself in the face in order to make a crying infant laugh? Well, the Minions are kind of like that. Displaying the most infantile physical humor designed to send a room full of small children into hysterical laughter. So why millions of adults laugh at these antics is beyond me.Final Thought: While it is true that I believe the Minions are the most annoying group of animated characters since the Chipmunks, if you read this review carefully my dislike of 'Despicable Me 2' goes deeper than a simple hatred of those freaky little tater tots with eyes. 'Despicable Me 2' is a supremely well animated, predictable and incredibly uncreative shell of the original, with every comedic moment playing for cheap laughs. And unlike most things in life, not even Pharrell can save this production. In short, there is really no reason to watch 'Despicable Me 2' unless you were dying to see a Minions spin off or you are under 10 years of age.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Insidious: Chapter 2," A haunting game of Yahtzee
","With 'Insidious' being arguably the best horror film of the past decade, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' had an impossible task to live up to. So no, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' isn't as innovative or nearly as scary as the original (while, it is funnier). And yes, there are moments of silliness that I can't defend. Oh, and I would suggest that one watches the original in order to fully understand the storyline of Chapter 2 (which is: After something follows Josh Lambert out of the spirit world, his family must uncover his mysterious childhood secret before it's too late). But with that said, 'Insidious: Chapter 2' is a more than worthy successor, as what it lacks in story, it more than makes up for in creativity; while still having an understanding that for a scary movie to work, at the very least, it must be scary.Side Note: For those who disliked 'Insidious' on the basis that the 'astral projection' aspect was 'too convoluted', you should be aware that director James Wan and company only add another layer of weirdness and campiness and over-the-top-ness to the plot of 'Insidious: Chapter 2'; especially when it takes a grand leap from the horror genre, to heavy science fiction, in the final act.Excluding 'The Godfather: Part 2', the worst kind of sequels are the ones whose sole purpose are to explain or extend its predecessor, using a back-story plot line. And while this may not sound like a flaw on paper, during said sequels the effective idea of the original soon becomes muddled, as the plot is stretched beyond its means and begins to fully focus on expanding the original, rather than giving the viewer a fresh story. And while 'Insidious: Chapter 2' should be considered an extension of its predecessor, and it does look to expand on the original, Wan, with the help of a highly creative script, has essentially created a new story which uses the 'Insidious' outline as more of a jumping off point, than anything else. Patrick Wilson (who has certainly become Wan's muse) does good work here, displaying his ability to play a menacing Norman Bates type. And as I alluded to before, Leigh Whannell's script is extremely well constructed (even whilst delving down pathways that are more than a little eccentric) but it's the direction that sells 'Insidious: Chapter 2'. With great camera work throughout, that eerily aggressive score which stands as the signature of a Wan production and moment after moment of either suspense or disturbing images (especially for a PG-13 film) Wan's direction is on point as usual, as he now stands as the best horror director working today. Even if you know the scares are coming, even if you've seen these horror tropes before (as recently as a month ago with 'The Conjuring') his direction is so effective that it would be extremely difficult not to become lost in the moment and jump out of your seat along with everyone else in the theater. Final Thought: I understand that horror cynics have been blindly picking this movie apart, even going so far as to lie and say that it wasn't entertaining. And while I won't argue that 'The Conjuring' was (ever so slightly) structurally the better of the 2013 Wan movies, that doesn't change the fact that I unapologetically enjoyed 'Insidious: Chapter 2' more so. Therefore, if you are a horror fan, and wish to partake in a scary/entertaining night at the movies, then 'Insidious: Chapter 2' is a must see.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Men in Black 3," Pitbull Sucks!
","Written Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland I waited ten years for this?! This third installment of the beloved (yet seemingly forgotten) 'Men in Black' franchise reunites not only Will Smith (The Pursuit of Happiness)and Tommy Lee Jones (No Country for Old Men), but also director Barry Sonnenfeld and writer Lowell Cunningham; in a film that leaves much to be desired when held side by side with the original. In fact, for the first forty-five minutes, 'Men in Black 3' is almost unwatchable, containing relatively no laughs. So, is Will Smith to blame simply because, unlike any film in the series before, 'Men in Black 3' is pretty much the Will Smith show? Well, the answer to that question is a resounding no. The disappointments here actually stem from not poor script structure, but an abundance of shockingly dull one liners. The sad fact is that Will Smith is given absolutely nothing funny to say for the first half of the film. And, of course, it doesn't help that during the final credits audiences are subjected to that God awful Pitbull song. It isn't until the arrival of Josh Brolin (No Country for Old Men), nearly half way through, that things with 'Men in Black 3' become even the slightest bit entertaining. And, as you can probably tell by my rating, this film does get better as the second hour hits its stride. But if what I say is true and only half the movie is worth watching, then shouldn't logic dictate that my admission price be cut in half? The Plot: This third installment follows Agent K (Jones) and (now veteran) Agent J (Smith) as they go about their Men in Black business; you know, protecting the earth from the scum of the universe and zapping people in the eyes with that memory eraser thing. But little do they know that an evil alien, with the very fitting name of Boris The Animal, has just escaped from intergalactic prison, and has the elimination of Agent K on his mind. But he doesn't plan on killing K in the conventional alien way (no probing). Boris plans to go back in time and kill young Agent K. So, when Agent J wakes up one day to find his partner missing, 'to find the truth, he has to do back in time' (damn you Pitbull!).There are really only two reasons to watch 'Men in Black 3': The first being the standout performances of Brolin, who is a shoe-in to one day play Tommy Lee Jones in the Tommy Lee Jones story, and Jemaine Clement (The Flight of the Conchords) who plays the witty and grotesque (best villain of the series) Boris The Animal. The second reason being, for how lackluster and ill conceived the plot of 'Men in Black 3' seems for about an hour, the twist in the final act is one of the most pleasantly surprising payoffs in any sci-fi movie I have seen since the 90's. I hesitate to say that this ending is so good that it makes up for the rest of this below average film, but...it sort of does.Final Thought: 'Men in Black 3' is a horse that starts the race off slow, but finishes strong. And while I don't see this horse winning any races among critics (and maybe I've just used one too many horse racing analogies for my own good) if you are a fan of the Men in Black series, 'Men in Black 3' will be something worth wasting a Saturday afternoon watching. On the other hand, if 'Men in Black 2' was in your mind, 'just OK', then don't waste your time with this film.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Captain Phillips," Don't believe the hype
","Why critics are so gaga over this movie, I have no idea. But once again, it is my job to be the voice of reason. There is no doubt the true story of the real Captain Phillips is quite compelling, but due to a misguided directorial effort from Paul Greengrass (The Bourne Supremacy, The Bourne Ultimatum) 'Captain Phillips' the movie simply comes off as a bit hollow and shockingly boring.Based on the true story of Captain Richard Phillips (played by Tom Hanks) who in 2009 was the Captain of an American cargo ship, which was hijacked by Somali pirates, I realize it makes me sound crazy or heartless that I was somewhat bored with a movie containing a premise which can only be described as: surefire Oscar bait, but I'll get right to the point. The biggest problem with 'Captain Phillips' is that not for one second did I believe Captain Phillips was in any danger of dyingand the man had multiple guns pointed to his head throughout! And before you say it, this criticism had nothing to do with the fact that I already knew the real life ending, because I knew the 'real life' ending of 'Argo' as well, but due to some excellent direction (thank you Ben Affleck) I questioned the survival of those characters until the very end. This goes back to the suspect direction that takes this 'can't miss' premise about a hostage situation and injects very little suspense or peril.The only thing saving this venture is the interactions between Captain Phillips and Muse (played by amateur actor, Barkhad Abdi) the Somali pirate leader. During these interactions the plight of the pirates does become more layered, therefore extending the premise of this film beyond the trailer. But other than that, Greengrass gives us little more than what's shown in the trailers. In fact, what he adds (a few million dollar tracking shots and a plethora of the Greengrass hand-held shots) only detracts from the film, as these camera movements become far too distracting when characters are simply standing still and attempting to have a conversation. I mean, while this could be considered to be somewhat of an 'action film', for much of 'Captain Phillips' it seemed as if Greengrass thought he was directing the next installment in the Bourne series, instead of a maritime drama, which (judging by the script) was meant to focus on personal interactions rather than hand to hand combat.This next paragraph may contain a spoiler: The Acting: Everybody on screen gives fine performances. But, the thing I would like to touch on is Tom Hanks' performance in the final few minutes of this movie. In the final few minutes, due to the situation Captain Phillips is placed in, Hanks must act as though he is under great emotional duress. I never associated the term 'overacting' with the great Tom Hanks, but the performance he puts forth in the final ten minutes, will surely garner scattered snickers from audiences.Final Thought: 'Captain Phillips' is a clear example of one of those films where meaningful things are happening on screen and (as an audience member) you understand that you should be feeling something, but, due to the director's inability to form an emotional connection with his audience, feel nothing but disconnection from the action. If you want to see a good movie about Somali piracy, check out 'Asad', the Oscar nominated short from a year ago. But unless you're talking about a DVD rental, don't waste eleven dollars on 'Captain Phillips'.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland",4,25,56,13 October 2013
The Expendables 2," Things explodeagain.
","'The Expendables 2' gives fans exactly what they came to see, more cartoonish, exploitive, action movie fluff (by means of explosions and guns) more laughable (but utterly ridiculous) one-liners, and overall one of the most immensely entertaining action movies of the year. Directed by Simon West (Con Air, The Mechanic) and written by Richard Wenk and Sylvester Stallone (who also stars in the film) 'The Expendables 2' is a much better version of its predecessor, simply because this time around the filmmakers are even more aware of the campy atmosphere which surrounds this (soon to be) franchise; and so they lay everything (the gunfire, the bombs, the kills) on thick (metaphorically winking after every bad pun or post-kill one-liner). And the fact that they took the camera out of Sylvester Stallone's hands and let West (a director who knows his way around an action movie) run the show only helps makes 'The Expendables 2' that much more enjoyable.Plot: The usual suspects are all back, including the likes of Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Stallone (who officially looks like a bulldog) as Barney Ross. And this time, this rag tag group of senior citizens (The Expendables) find themselves going head to head with a villain, comically named Villain, who is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Oh, and to make things even better, there's also a cameo from the one and only Chuck Norris. Anyway, in this sequel The Expendables mission iswell, who really cares. All one really needs to know is wherein 'The Expendables' things blew up, in 'The Expendables 2' things continue to blow up plus heads blow off. Actually the male-centric, 'things blow up' perception a film like this reeks of may be the most interesting misconception at work here. From the trailers (and 'The Expendables') one would think a movie which sees a seemingly never-ending barrage of constant explosions would become rather boring or mind numbing (as with any Michael Bay film) West, Went and Stallone have succeeded in consistently keeping its audience on their toes by not relying on explosions alone to entertain. When the explosions become too repetitive in a finite period of time, a few laughable one-liners are thrown in, and when the one-liners get old, there is a cameo thrown in, and so on and so forth until the film's climactic and testosterone infused battle.Yes, most of the special effects used here are ridiculously bad, the film is filled with moments of very dry exposition which slow it to a halt and the melodramatic bromance banter delivered from the plastic surgically enhanced lips of Stallone are cringe inducing at best. But in saying that, there are more than enough well inserted cameos (Chuck Norris tells a Chuck Norris joke!) very entertaining, over-the-top/explosive scenarios and tons of 'it's so bad that it's good' laugh out loud moments, that if you don't find yourself smiling throughout at least 80% of 'The Expendables 2', then my consensuses (as a self-anointed critic) would have to be that: YOU HATE FUN! The Dialogue: When I made mention that there is laughable dialogue throughout this film (no matter how self-aware it may be) I may have been selling 'The Expendables 2' short. This film is built on a foundation of constant, laughable and very cliché zingers (maybe breaking the record for the amount of one-liners used in a single film) which in any other film would have had any normal person's eyes rolling so much so, they could be mistaken for someone in the middle of a seizure, but this dialogue works because it was tailor-made for this film. I would go so far as to say that amidst the overly campy tone, the dialogue itself is so perfectly self-aware of its own mockery of bad 80's action films, that in the confines of an exploitation film such as this, the Wenk and Stallone script can be seen as a very well written satirical piece.Final Thought: I can see how some people can hate the 'my gun is bigger than yours' mentality that a film like 'The Expendables 2' brings to the table, but on the other hand, this is not a movie that tries to mask what it is. It is an exploitive action throwback on steroids, and proud of it. Again, it's that self-awareness which in and of itself allows this film to maintain its high entertainment value against a seemingly predictable plot. So now, the only question that remains is: Who will be the next aging action star to make a cameo in 'The Expendables 3'? Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Skyfall," 007 Rises
","I don't want to add to the 'Quantum of Solace' dog pile that seems to be forming by every other critic writing a 'Skyfall' review, but what I will say is, next to Quantum, 'Skyfall' should be considered as the Bond franchise getting back on track; with the help of an Academy Award winning director. With Daniel Craig (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo)reprising his role as the best James Bond ever and Judi Dench (Notes on a Scandal) reprising her role as M, 'Skyfall' (in a curious turn of events) sees Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Revolutionary Road) taking the helm, directing the darkest and most beautifully shot film of the series. Known for his intimate dramas, Mendes' rendition focuses less on getting the 'bad guy' or on Bond girls (I am aware that Bond has multiple affairs in this film, but none of them are very prominent) and more on the internal struggles of an aging Bond. And along with the new era 007 stable of script writers, but this time excluding Paul Haggis (Crash, Million Dollar Baby) which is one of the missteps this film, 'Skyfall' should be seen as an overall success...even if it leaves some audiences checking their watches.The Plot: After a direct terrorist attack on the M16 building, Bond attempts to find out who is behind it all. But when he discovers that the perpetrator (played brilliantly by Javier Bardem) may have a direct link to M herself, his loyalty to her is truly tested. There is also a subplot, that only Mendes could get away with, dealing with British intelligence who are seen as unnecessary dinosaurs and Bond who has lost a step or two after a friendly-fire gunshot wound leaves him questioning his life as a Double O agent (I am not ruining anything that is not in the trailer or in an IMDb synopsis already). And if you think this subplot sounds a little too dramatic to be in a Bond film, then you may cringe when I inform you that this introspective storyline runs a majority of the show during the large gaps in action in the first hour or so. Suffice to say, the film does get much better after it's rather slow beginnings, culminating in arguably the best/most visually stunning final half hour yet.Side Note: Even though 'Skyfall' as a whole gets better as it progresses, I can soundly say that this is not the Bond film that will convert anybody who was not a Bond fan or British already. I am sorry to say, that due to some pitfalls this movie runs into along the way, some audiences may even find themselves becoming a bit bored.Yes, 'Skyfall' does pay homage to past (or future) films, it does contain the corny one-liners that are expected from a James Bond adventure (only this time they are even drier and more alienatingly British than in the past two Bond films) and Bond is still a womanizing, Captain save awell you know the rest. But there is an issue, which plagues 'Skyfall' throughout. The disjointedness of many prominent scenes will undoubtedly cause confusion amidst Bond lover and novice alike. In fact, there is a major scene involving Bond, which happens within the first ten minutes (if you've seen it, then you know what I'm talking about) that is never explained, and really left me scratching my head as to what the point of that particular plot twist was (I wish I could say more, but I don't want to be accused of spoiling anything). Aside from this very distracting plot hole (one you could drive a truck through) there are other moments, when Bond ventures off on a mission and it takes two to three minutes into each scene to figure out why he is where he is, what the mission is and who the characters he interacts with are. These major lapses in story structure should be attributed to the lackluster script put forth by the normally witty Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan; a script that will mistakenly be interpreted as quite sharp because of its redeeming finale. Javier Bardem: Playing not only one of the most scene stealing villains since Heath Ledger's Joker, as well as reviving what we know to be the classic Bond villain; when Bardem's character Silva is introduced around the second act, his uniquely flamboyant brand of villainy brings this movie back to life (no pun intended). I can't say this loud enough: Javier Bardem is the best part of this movie, and if anything, his flawless and award worthy performance is one of the only reasons I am recommending 'Skyfall'.Final Thought: I am not claiming to be a Bond expert, or to have an intimate knowledge of Ian Fleming's characters, but as a member of the movie going public I would say that 'Skyfall' contains one of the best Bond anthems of any Bond movie ('Skyfall' sung by Adele) the best villain of any Bond movie and the bravest/most visually interesting direction (mostly visible in the final half hour) of any Bond film to date. But is this the best Bond film ever? No. 'Goldfinger' is better, 'From Russia with Love' is better and 'Casino Royale' is one of the best. As an overall film, 'Skyfall' is good but not great...especially not as great as many of my fellow critics, blinded by Mendes' past work, are making it out to be.

Iron Man 3," New director, same entertainment factor.
","On the plus side, director Shane Black essentially does with 'Iron Man 3' what Sam Mendes did for the Bond franchise with 'Skyfall'. He put it back on track (at least creatively anyway). It's not like 'Iron Man 2' was a bad superhero movie (especially next to 'Captain America: The First Avenger') but coming off of the initial blockbuster that was 'Iron Man', director John Favreau had much to live up to. Thus, for a lot of people 'Iron Man 2' was a minor disappointment, of which Black has been sent in to correct. Now, does Black accomplish something profound here? Something Favreau wasn't able to do with the previous Iron Man's? Well, the answer is no, not really. Though the material is funnier, much of the visuals are explosion-centric and there is a startling amount of Gwyenth Paltrow abs, the direction isn't as different as many are claiming (which is a good thing). In the end, 'Iron Man 3' is more of Robert Downey Jr.'s charismatic sensibility, and that's basically all that matters when talking about this franchise.Synopsis: When Tony Stark/Iron Man begins suffering from panic attacks on the wake of terrorist attacks by the Bin Laden-esque evil doer, The Mandarin, he begins to reevaluate what being Iron Man actually means to his livelihood and sanity. So, while that storyline sounds dark (or Nolan-esque) 'Iron Man 3' sadly contains a more prominent and quite generic storyline, having to do with an alternate villain. A villain who has been cleverly left out of the trailers, but after an experiment gone wrong, plans to take over the world (don't they always?).When these two story lines combine, the plot itself isn't as strong as I expected. In fact, at times it becomes a bit overcomplicated. But again, the Iron Man franchise has always been more about the performances and the snappy dialogue than the plot.Supporting Cast: Ty Simpkins (or mini-Robert Downey Jr. as I like to call him) the little boy who plays Harley Keener, steals the show for the relatively small amount of time he is on screen. Actually it is the chemistry between him and Downey Jr. during their scenes together, which are unequivocally the funniest moments of the film. As for Paltrow, who returns in her role as Pepper Potts, she is pretty blah. But not enough to be a distraction, somoving on.Side Note: Undeniably, the most questionable aspect of 'Iron Man 3' has to be the (dare I say) innovative way Black chooses to play out the role of The Mandarin (played by Ben Kingsley) whose character takes a comically unexpected, but spoiler-ridden turn half way through the movie. That said, when the villain in a superhero movie is delivering an abundance of funny lines, one could make the argument that at times the dialogue and scenarios have become a bit too Joss Whedon for their own good. And before you say it, I realize that Whedon wasn't a part of the writing team of 'Iron Man 3'. But maybe my issue with this overly comedic tone used for The Mandarin character goes back to the fundamental flaw with trying to compare the future of Disney's Marvel world with the future of DC comic films. On the wings of Christopher Nolan, DC has gone down the path of heavy drama, creating characters who are more flawed, more disturbed and more realistic. Now, Marvel seems to be going the other way with it, keeping an old fashioned sense of comic book levity, with film after film constructed on comedic foundations; i.e. 'Iron Man' or 'The Avengers'. Meaning, even though there is superhero action throughout, in Marvel films there are not only many comic relief characters, but also protagonists and antagonist who are quirky and quick with a funny one liner. So with that logic, the fact that 'Iron Man 3' must be labeled as a superhero action/comedy, should not be held against it by fans of The Dark Knight franchise (like myself). In other words, from this point forward, if you are going to see a Marvel film, be expected to laugh. On the other hand, everything I've just stated may end up being toilet fodder with the upcoming release of Marvel's 'The Wolverine'.Final Thought: Don't bother waiting around to see what clip is shown after the credits of this film. Trust me. The movie is long enough and the post credits clip is definitely not worth holding in a bladder full of urine for.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Gravity," Hope Floats
","Screw 'The Blind Side'! Where's Sandra Bullock's Oscar nomination for 'Gravity'?! Not a spoiler, but while this film does star Bullock and George Clooney, this is Bullock's movie, in the same way 'Cast Away' was Tom Hanks' movie.From the initial sequence (which happens to be one of the greatest long takes I have ever seen) 'Gravity' contains a nonstop barrage of emotionally breathtaking visual sequences (with even the POV working exceptionally well) an emotionally draining string of events and a handful of shots, so powerful (on a technical and emotional level) that they will simply leave you speechless, as you gaze upon the screen for 90 minutes.The two reasons people may be apprehensive to see 'Gravity' are: 1.They think that it's going to be like 'Open Water' and they thought 'Open Water' was boring. The fact is, 'Gravity' is more like '127 Hours', which is definitely not boring. But more importantly, the greatest difference between 'Open Water' and 'Gravity' (and I really enjoyed 'Open Water') is that one contains Oscar worthy direction...and the other is 'Open Water'.2.They think that because it is set around someone stranded in space, it is unrelatable. While the plot's relatablitly may come under well deserved scrutiny (I mean, how many of us are ever going to find ourselves stranded in space with George Clooney?) it doesn't take anything away from the movie's suspenseful nature and entertainment value. Plus (and this may be getting too artsy-fartsy) writer/director Alfonso Cuaron has constructed his film in such a way, that while it is about a situation a vast majority may not be able to fathom, the themes of isolation, regret and mortality make 'Gravity' more relatable than most Hollywood dramas set on Earth.Flaws: With visuals as masterful as these, a lackluster story could have the potential to be seen as a blemish on an otherwise beautiful face. And admittedly, the story here is ultra simplistic (Synopsis: Sandra Bullock is an astronaut. After an accident leaves her stranded in space, she must figure out a way to get back to earth before it's too late). Yet, as this movie progresses, the more and more I seemed to develop an appreciation for how well the story was put together. This doesn't mean that there weren't flaws within 'Gravity' that didn't bother me a little. The biggest one being: Near the end, 'Gravity' contains some sequences of forced Oscar bait, punctuated by a few lines of melodrama. But, even in this case, said flaws can be forgiven in an IMAX theater.Final Thought: As I alluded to earlier, aside from the stunning (the Oscar for best director goes to) visuals, the fact that 'Gravity' works as a straight story as well as a metaphor, gives the hardly-there plot a tremendous amount of heft and complexity. 'Gravity' is a true triumph in filmmaking, which leads me to my final line. A final line which I never thought I would be compelled to write in all my years of film criticism: I wish I had seen this movie in IMAX 3D!",9,2,3,5 October 2013

","Why isn't Jay Baruchel in more things?! Well, more relevant things. I mean 'Goon' was a really good movie, but how many people saw that? The writing team that brought you 'Superbad', Seth Rogen and the very hit and miss Evan Goldberg, come together once again to write and direct this film. Adapted from a 2007 short by Goldberg, Rogen and Baruchel entitled Jay and Seth Versus the Apocalypse, 'This Is the End' has one of the most simplistically brilliant plot lines in film history. Basically, Rogen, Baruchel and every other comedic actor you can think of (all playing themselves) attend a party at James Franco's houseand then the world ends. This plays out like an elongated Funny or Die skit. The only difference being that 'This Is the End' is consistently funny.There is actually a subplot dealing with Rogan and Baruchel growing apart as friends which works really well (in 'Superbad'-esque fashion) only because of the construction of the script and some rather genuine chemistry from its two leads. And can I take a minute to talk about how well this film looks for being both Rogen and Goldberg's directorial debuts? I mean, aside from the onslaught of funny one-liners, this end-of-days film looks like a million bucks (in a good way). Even when some of the CGI does slip into a cartoonish realm, like seasoned vets, Rogen and Goldberg maintain the tonal atmosphere befitting each scene; be it a high octane chase sequence or a few well placed dance sequences.Side Note: When I say everybody is in this movie, I do mean EVERYBODY. But the cameo that clearly steals the show is from Michael Cera in his most outlandishly crass and hilarious role ever; a performance that is almost worth the price of admission alone. Trust me. If you weren't a Cera fan before, which is supremely understandable with him being the most annoying kind of Canadian and all, then you will be after this.'This Is the End' is what every person paying $11 for their movie ticket should expect, but rarely gets from a modern comedy. It's not only an adult comedy that actually contains non-stop laughs for a change, but 'This Is the End' is the funniest movie since '40 Year Old Virgin'. This also is a much needed return to comedic form for Rogan and to a lesser extent Jonah Hill (only because '21 Jump Street' was pretty funny) and clearly is the funniest movie the rest of this cast has been a part of by far. Hell, even Danny McBride is hilarious here. And we all know how much I hate Danny McBride.Final Thought: There are so many memorable one-liners in this movie, it is sure to become an instant comedy classic. And why most of these jokes work is because they are so self-deprecating. Yes, THIS IS about 20 minutes too long and it is essentially a movie full of phallic and weed tangents, but when it comes right down to it 'This Is the End' is a comedy which contains very few bits that don't work (mostly coming near the end) and is drowned in laugh out loud moments from minute one, to a finale that blows the one in 'Bridesmaids' right out of the water. I hate to constantly pick on 'Bridesmaids' (well, hate is such a strong word) but Kristen Wiig and crew should really take note on how a real comedy like 'This Is the End' constructs a final sequence. I'm just saying.",9,12,29,12 June 2013
World War Z," A PG-13 zombie movie.
","In an era which saw the resurgence of the gore-centric zombie in movies and now with the television show 'The Walking Dead', how do you make a PG-13 zombie film interesting? The answer is, you can't really. And as much as 'World War Z' tries to abide by the MPAA restrictions by replacing the skin tearing horror aspect of today's zombies with high amounts of action and suspense, at the end of the day this is still a PG-13 zombie movie that seems to have left most of its visual potency/potential on the cutting room floor.Synopsis: Brad Pitt (who looks like he just came off the set of that Chanel commercial) plays Gerry Lane, a family man who is just trying to eat breakfast with his wife and two daughters when the zombie apocalypse hits. But little do the zombies know that Gerry is equipped with 'a special set of skills'. These special skills (I guess) give him the ability to be one step ahead of everyone else in the movie, while simultaneously the ability to continuously claim to have no idea what's going on. Oh and let's get this joke out of the way. Yes, his character does sort of adopt a young Latino child little a less than half way through the movie. Coincidence? Side Note: OK, so I haven't read the critically acclaimed Max 'son of Mel' Brooks novel that 'World War Z' was loosely based on, but I've heard the allegations of how only the name was used, while pretty much all other aspects where scrapped. And though this may anger loads of people who loved the original source material, they need to get over it because this is nothing new in the world of Hollywood adaptations. Plus, there is much more here to gripe about than a non-existent adaptation.But first the good stuff: In a movie like this where your average viewer is all too familiar with the villain(s) at hand, what audiences really want to see is something new when pertaining to the zombie look or mythos. So it was not surprise that the things I enjoyed the most about 'World War Z' were the few aspects of this zombie movie which could be perceived as fresh or different. Such as: addressing the eccentric ways other countries would deal with an outbreak of global proportions and presenting these particular zombies as an unthinking mass liken to a psychotic mob that quickly devours cities full of people like locusts.While it does speak to how post-heavy the CGI is when Brad Pitt is on record criticizing the look of a movie he financially backed, for the most part the direction from Marc Forster (Monster's Ball, Quantum of Solace) isn't bad. In fact, his direction is more or less the reason 'World War Z' is way more entertaining and suspenseful than it has any right to be. That said, the visuals are hindered by a story with hardly any preface and a troubled script that is unbearably sentimental at times.Along with a few battle sequences and more than a few stretches of unexpected suspense, Pitt's performance is a smaller, but still prevalent reason as to why 'World War Z' is watchable. He does his best here, much in the same way Tom Cruise attempts to save 'Jack Reacher', especially during the overly melodramatic lulls when audiences may be pleading for some kind of action. There is also one really memorable cameo from character actor David Morse (The Green Mile) who plays a toothless Ex-CIA Agent. And while he is only on screen for a few minutes, he does make enough of an impact to garner a few lines in this review.OK, so I know you thought that I was never going to get to them, but here are my gripes: There are basically two huge factors which hold 'World War Z' back from being a strong recommendation.1. How the zombies look and act: In mass quantities (shot from extremely long distances) the zombies take on the terrifying feel of the aforementioned swarm of locusts devouring everything in their path. But in latter scenes, when Pitt must go one on one with these zombies (in extreme close ups) their mannerisms do come off as involuntarily spastic and awkwardly laughable.2. The PG-13-ness: The cut-aways here are nothing short of embarrassing. When somebody gets attacked, Forster cuts. When a solder has an appendage cut off, Forster turns the camera away as if something more interesting is going on on the other side of the room. Suffice to say, when any kind of violence that could beget blood or gore rears its head, Forster cuts away in a back handed constant reminder that, like a small child, there are things in this movie that we (as audience members) are being shielded from. I guess you could say that as much as Forster does to make this tame zombie movie entertaining, he does just as much to relegate it to the B movie status that it takes on.Final Thought: Filled with suspenseful, entertaining and surprisingly well thought out moments, in the end 'World War Z' is too PG-13 for its own good. And even with the few 'new' zombie elements, I would never expect someone to pay for this movie if they have access to a zombie television show with more brutal realism and better writing.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

The Impossible," Sappy, yet effective.
","If the only objective of 'The Impossible' was to make an entire theater full of grown adults cry, then MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! Based on the 'true story' of a (Spanish?) family who survived (not a spoiler alert, only because this movie was seemingly made to be utterly predictable) the 2004 tsunami which hit South Asia, 'The Impossible', directed by Juan Antonio Bayona (The Orphanage) in incredibly impressive fashion and containing fairly compelling performances from the likes of Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor, would have been assuredly one of the best films of 2012 (and an Oscar contender) if only it wasn't hampered by an overbearingly sappy script, with plotting worthy of The Lifetime Channel, from Sergio G. Sanchez.While Sanchez's plot development makes 'The Impossible' one of the most predictable movies you will ever see, this aspect doesn't actually hinder the film as much as one would expect. For one, during the initial act, the fact that audiences are fully aware of the impending doom, works as a form of suspense on the same level as a well crafted horror film would. Secondly, the payoff (which is drenched in predictability) during the climax, shockingly works immensely well due to a lot of help from a well choreographed sequence from Bayona. Furthermore, though this was truly a climax which everybody in the theater could and will see coming from a mile away, it is 'impossible' to not be swept away (figuratively) in the moment; no matter how cynical a movie-goer you may be. As for the middle chunk of 'The Impossible', it rides that fine line between visual excellence and a forced 'triumph of the human spirit' storyline, with the reoccurring theme of sappiness rearing its head again and again and once more, directly following the great climax with an eye rolling prolonged ending.Side Note: Kudos to the director for not shying away from showing the most realistic depiction possible of the people who lived through and died during this tsunami. And by that I don't just mean the violence and gruesomeness of people drowning and being impaled by large pieces of debris, but more so the amount of nudity, i.e. not going the American PG-13 rout of showing us tsunami victims who are cut up, arms broken and eyes popping out of their head, but with clothes still intact. With that said, while nothing in this film is gratuitous (aside from the gratuitous sappiness) how this movie passed without an R rating with the amount of Naomi Watts' breasts shown, during a time when American parents are more afraid of their thirteen year old seeing a woman's exposed nipple than a movie riddled with gun violence, is one of the most impressive things I've seen in an American distributed film in quite a while. In short, if you where planning on seeing this movie with your kids, then see this movie with your kids; a little breast never hurt anybody.Final Thought: Though I still stand by my point that the overwhelmingly forced pathos throughout does drag this film down a bit, I will say 'The Impossible' contains some of the most impressive visuals of 2012; just falling short of Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi'. But still the most overwhelming aspect that this film has going for it, is how eventually (and quite forcefully) it pulls at the heartstrings so much so, that much like those SPCA commercials, you won't be able to help yourself but choose the emotional response of 'that poor family', rather than a rational one of 'this isn't that great of a movie'.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

42," From a Black Man's Perspective.
","'42' is what you would call 'a fluff piece' in journalistic terms. A very well written fluff piece, but a fluff piece nonetheless. Written and directed by Brian Helgeland, a white guy who is more known for his script writing abilities than his directorial prowess, '42' tells not so much the life story of Jackie Robinson (even though it has the ostentatious runtime of 128 minutes) but more so the story of Robinson's historic breaking of the color barrier in baseball, due to the signing by Branch Rickey, the team executive of the Brooklyn Dodgers at the time.Even though I am giving this film a recommendation, maybe the best way to describe it would be with the term 'hokey entertainment'. From the initial sappy score, to some cringe inducing dialogue along the way, at first glance '42' would seem like something you could see on ABC Family during Black History Month.Not to say '42' isn't entertaining because it is, but do I think a movie about Jackie Robinson should have been this tame? The answer is a resounding no! And therein lies the problem. I'm no historian, but in a movie concerning integration in the 40's, it is nothing less than a distracting inaccuracy (which took me completely out of this film multiple times) when at no point did I fear for Robinson's life. Therefore, I don't think I'm making a grand leap in saying that some of the more graphic material was Disney'd up, in order to make '42' a movie for the whole family. In short, the stakes here are disappointingly low for this type of material. On the other hand, I saw a Meet the Press interview with Jackie Robinson's wife, who claimed that she loved the movie because of its 'authenticity'. That said, throughout this overlong film there are flashes of sheer compelling grittiness, which act like shining beacons of a movie I wished this could have been.The Acting: The acting from the two leads is pretty impressive for different reasons. Virtual unknown Chadwick Boseman (who plays Jackie Robinson) is exceptionally good here, demanding attention whenever he is on screen. I am very excited to see what the future holds for him. As for Harrison Ford, he devours the scenery with his portrayal of Branch Rickey, in his most intriguing performance since 'Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade'. Oh, and I should make mention that John C. McGinley plays Red Barber (the Brooklyn Dodgers radio broadcaster at the time) and is part of undoubtedly one of the funniest comic bits this side of 'Best in Show'.Helgeland's Direction: There is really nothing special looking in '42' when focusing on scenes where characters are sitting around chatting. But EVERY SINGLE scene on the baseball field will have audiences on the edge of their seats. The way the camera follows Boseman as he runs the base path is a technique I've never seen before.But, when I speak of 'grittiness', I am definitely speaking of a few scenes in particular. The most prominent being the heckling scene where the Phillies manager, played with gusto by Alan Tudyk, showers Jackie Robinson with 'N-bombs', as Robinson stands in the batter's box during a game. This is essentially the best sequence of the film, because it is one of the only scenes which transcends the hokeyness; giving audiences a cold dose of realism. Too bad scenes like this were so few and far between.Final Thought: In the end, I wanted a pre-African American civil rights movement movie with more bite (or maybe one directed by Spike Lee) and instead I got something that while not forgettable, is no 'Malcolm X'. On the other hand, I wasn't bored like I was during 'Red Tails' or offended like I was throughout 'The Blind Side'.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Argo," Oh, Canada!
","Dear Ben Affleck,With 'Gone Baby Gone', 'The Town' and now 'Argo' under your belt, I don't think anybody (mainly myself) can deny your prowess as a top tier filmmaker any longer. So, before I began with my actual review, I wanted to preface it with this short statement, which you should take as a letter of apology for every negative thing I've ever said about your filmmaking through the years, as well as a letter of forgiveness for 'Gigli', 'Jersey Girl' and 'Daredevil'...well, maybe not 'Daredevil'.Synopsis: Directed by Ben Affleck, 'Argo' is a film which dramatizes the declassified true story (set in the late 70's/early 80's) of CIA agent Tony Mendez (played by Affleck) who spearheaded the insane plan to secretly extract six fugitive American diplomatic personnel out of a revolutionary Iran, by posing as a fake Canadian film crew scouting a fake Canadian film (a 'Star Wars' rip-off by the name of 'Argo'). And while this synopsis sadly may not sound like it would translate into a compelling Saturday night date movie (especially to those who didn't live through the actual event, or to those who think purchasing tickets to see the newest Silent Hill film is a good way to spend their money) what puts it over-the-top/makes this premise sing, is the undeniably engaging combination of Chris Terrio's screenplay, which perfectly balances comedic scenes with ones of gritty wartime events (maybe the toughest thing to do in scriptwriting) and Affleck's spot on portrayal of late 70's Iran and America (at times using actual footage) showcasing a devastatingly provocative parallel to that point in history and the post 9/11 atmosphere in the United States, as well as his startlingly brilliant ability to take a rather simplistic resolution (final 45 minutes) and mold it into one of the most suspenseful climaxes in recent years.The only real flaw I could see in 'Argo' is that with such a wealth of great actors, and the movie primarily surrounding Affleck's character, for long stretches of the film actors such as Bryan Cranston (who in my opinion, has overtaken Stanley Tucci as the best character actor working today) John Goodman and Alan Arkin (who are all excellent in their roles) aren't really given much to do. My only wish (if this movie weren't already 2 hours long) would've been to see more scenes showcasing this strong supporting cast.Final Thought: Aside from the fact that 'Argo' may garner him an Oscar nomination, what director Affleck has done with this film, is shown his incredible Spielberg-esque ability to take a historical event, that may have come off as dry or utterly uneventful in other hands, and make it so every second of what's on screen, no matter how seemingly mundane or complex, is impressively compelling. If you haven't figured it out by now, what I'm saying is that everyone should go see 'Agro' (as it is one of the best movies of the year so far) even if movies described as 'historical dramas' immediately make you reply with the phrase: 'so what else is playing?'Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Star Trek Into Darkness," No Ceti eel larvae?!
","A disclaimer before I begin: I am not going to waste time during this review comparing 'Star Trek Into Darkness' to 1982's 'Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan', because aside from the fact that 'Wrath of Khan' is a substantially better film, these are two different movies, with two differing story lines and vastly differing villains (even if they do share the same name). In fact, if you hadn't noticed from the 2009 lens flare riddled installment, director J.J. Abrams has chosen to take the Star Trek series down a different path, instead of re-treading like so many remakes tend to do. And while they may hold some similarities, 'Into Darkness' should not be considered a remake of 'Wrath of Khan', but more so a re-imagining. Hence, this review will not be a comparative one. I won't talk about the fact that there are few men who can match the flamboyant cartoonishness of Ricardo Montalban's Khan, and Benedict Cumberbatch isn't one of them. I won't talk about the interestingly restructured, but very family friendly cop-out ending which is tacked on to this installment. And I won't even mention how unlike William Shatner, Captain Kirk is likely to be the only watchable role actor Chris Pine will play during his hopefully short lived career. I won't talk about any of that. This will be a straight up critique of 'Star Trek Into Darkness' based on its own merits. Now, onto my review: After an act of terrorism on earth, Captain Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise must venture out into enemy territory to pursue a man, whom they suspect to be a rogue officer. But when they finally come face to face with him, he turns out to be a one man weapon of mass destruction. And his name happens to be Khan. If that means nothing to you, then stop reading now.While J.J. Abrams' direction is as flashy as expected, his constant need to explore every off-the-wall camera angle possible doesn't really do anything to propel the movie into warp speed (see what I did there?). What does work, is the reprisal of Zachary Quinto's magnificently dry depiction of Spock, who, along with a lively supporting cast which includes, Simon Pegg as Scotty, John Cho as Sulu, Karl Urban as Bones, Anton Yelchin as Chekov, Zoe Saldana as Uhura and a surprisingly ultra-comedic script, are the only reasons as to why 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is entertaining at all.Benedict Cumberbatch as Khan: I am a huge Cumberbatch fan (just to get that out of the way) but his performance here honestly left me of cold. Let me rephrase that. The way Cumberbatch was utilized within the confines of this storyline was what left me cold. 'Star Trek Into Darkness' contains one of the most underutilized villains in any science fiction film to date. During the first half of this movie, Khan is seen and described to be a superhuman-like being, who is touted to be nearly indestructible. But when Cumberbatch finally gets some heavy screen time, all Khan does is spend a few scenes speaking with a stern inflection and then a few more scenes punching people and getting punched, and then it's over. What a letdown.Even though the comedic moments in 'Star Trek Into Darkness' move this two hour plus movie forward, sadly this 'action film' contains only a few action sequences (and by that, I mean two) which were memorable or made me lean forward in my seat. And therein lies the main issue at hand. I don't want to say that anything visually about this film was poorly constructed, because it wasn't. This is also not a Michael Bay movie which contains an annoying overload of explosions. All of the action sequences here have their respective place. There are even moments (during the last hour) when Abrams creates an atmosphere of suspense, which promises potential, but (even with its highly eventful score) soon recedes into another bland or simply shrug inducing action sequence. I guess what I'm trying to say is, not much in 'Star Trek Into Darkness' was all that impressive. And I am including the final battle sequence in that discussion.Final Thought: 'Star Trek Into Darkness' is the type of movie which lives and dies on its audience's expectations. While 'Into Darkness' is big budget, looks nice and is all and all a fine movie, the fact that it never became as engaging as I (along with a room full of men wearing Spock ears) expected it to be, is a problem. So, even though this is not a Sci-Fi film which will be scoffed at during upcoming episodes of 'The Big Bang Theory', if you aren't a Star Trek fan, 'Star Trek Into Darkness' isn't the movie that will convert you. In fact, for you the weighted melodrama within this film, may become far too irritating to stand after a while. And if you are a Trekkie, then chances are you've stopped reading a while back, upon noticing that this wasn't a five star review. In short, if you're a fan of Star Trek, then you're going to see 'Star Trek Into Darkness' regardless of what I have to say.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

The Babadook," Do Some Mothers Hate Their Children?
","Touted as the scariest movie of the year and loved by critics, audiences and filmmakers alike (which pretty much never happens) this little independent feature is admittedly the best horror to come out of Australia that I can remember. That said, it's only competition is that God-awful 'Wolf Creek', so...Synopsis: The anniversary of the death of her husband is always a hard time of year for Amelia (Essie Davis, who is actually pretty great in this). But compounded with the fact that her bratty child has not only gotten himself kicked out of grade school due to his unusual hobby of constructing homemade projectiles, but also recently made her read a book, which may have summoned a demon called the Babadook (a taker of children) into the house, which just so happens to coincide with her going a little crazy herself.Though writer/director Jennifer Kent's first attempt at a feature is more miss than hit, all in all, 'The Babadook' is filmed quite well. And though there are absolutely no scares (IN THIS HORROR FILM) the moments when Amelia is descending into madness definitely displays Kent's distinctive voice in the horror genre.Final Thought: Yes, the 3rd Act is a mess of clunky visuals, wasted potential and a final few sequences that are pretty damn confusing, plain and simple. And 'The Babadook' is a horror film that isn't scary at all, unless you count a child who constantly throws tantrums as terrifying; which for some is quite terrifying. The fact that the underlying theme at the heart of the conflict between the mother and her child and the Babadook, may come down to the fact that a mother can hate her own child, is not only fairly untapped territory and quite morbid, but also pretty interesting. But again, whatever interest I had mounted up to that point, was totally scared off by this shockingly disappointing ending; even by Video on Demand standards.",4,18,41,10 December 2014
Ted," It was the drugs that made him a real boy!
","While there are many funny moments, 'Ted' tends to run into the same problems that one would expect out of an almost two hour episode of 'Family Guy'; a simplistic story with some extremely clever jokes and hilarious one liners mixed equally with niche 80's references and jokes that bomb miserably. With the assistance of many of the actors from Seth MacFarlane's own animated creations (Family Guy, American Dad) and Mark Wahlberg (Boogie Nights, The Fighter), the uber-talented MacFarlane writes/directs and does the voice of the talking teddy bear himself, in his first feature film 'Ted'.Using his own satirical take on New England culture, MacFarlane crafts the story of an inanimate teddy bear named Ted, who because of a wish from a child named John, becomes a vulgar talking teddy bear who smokes pot and loves the ladies. But years later as 35 year old John and Ted's juvenile relationship continues, John's girlfriend Lori wonders if there is any hope for her relationship with John to become serious as long as Ted is constantly hanging around. While this super simplistic buddy comedy storyline is accentuated by various comic detours (or bits) that are good for some out loud laughs, the demo audience (depending on how young they are) may not get a substantial amount of the heavy 1980's references, such as a constant (but well crafted) cameo from Flash Gordon himself, Sam Jones.Problems arise in the second half of this film when the comic momentum is all but lost, due to a combination of necessary story arch sentimentality, an overuse of 80's reference and a 'bad guy' element that not even an immensely talented actor like Giovanni Ribisi (Boiler Room) could salvage. There is also the visually distracting fact that Walberg is so much older than Mila Kunis (who plays his long time girlfriend) but, I digress.Final Thought: I will say it again, MacFarlane is undoubtedly one of the most talented people on television (in the 30 minute format) and while 'Ted' showcases why his fanbase is so large, his feature film directorial attempt isn't as strong as other animation geniuses turned filmmakers, such as Mike Judge (King of the Hill, Office Space). Go see 'Ted' if you are a fan of Seth MacFarlane, otherwise seeing a movie like this, may turn out to be only an above average and far too hit and miss of a movie going experience.",6,8,15,3 July 2012
Don Jon," Better than 'Shame'
","In what would make an excellent double feature with Steve McQueen's extremely depressing but unfortunately flawed (by way of Carey Mulligan) 'Shame', 'Don Jon', an at times equally graphic (just with no full frontal) film (written and directed by and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt) tells the story of a Don Juan-type Jersey boy, named Jon, who states that he only cares about a few things in life; his body, his pad, his ride, his family, his church, his boys, his girls and most of all, his porn. But when he meets the girl of his dreams, played by Scarlett Johansson, who also just happens to absolutely detest pornography, Jon is forced to confront his porn addiction head on. Side Note: While the subject matter of 'Don Jon' isn't solely fixated on internet porn addiction (it brings up interesting criticisms on everything from sexual images in the media, to the unhealthy nature of the 'chick flick', to a quite scathing look at how outdated the Catholic church (or any religious institution for that matter) seems to be when it comes to dealing with the young people of today) it mostly is about porn addiction, so viewer beware. This movie earns its R rating. The fact that the trailers make it seem like this is going to be some kind of romantic comedy, is a bit of a misnomer. While 'Don Jon' does deliver instances of 'funny', as it moves forward and Levitt's character becomes more realized and less cartoonish, the movie fully abandons the comedic for the serious and quite dark (still, not as dark as 'Shame', but more than likely darker than a majority of audiences will have expected). 'Don Jon' is pretty much a movie of two halves. The first, I will refer to as the Scarlett Johansson half, and the second, the Julianne Moore half. The Johansson portion is quite funny and entertaining, as we watch Jon attempt to juggle a girlfriend alongside his 'personal activities' (basically, everything you see in the trailers). The issue with this half is that it never feels authentic enough to be taken all that seriously. Now, once Moore's character enters the picture, 'Don Jon' becomes not just a particularly poignant film, but nearly flawless. During this aforementioned 'darker' (or more dramatic) section, we follow Jon as he discovers the effects of pornography on his intimacy and overall interactions with women. The greatest triumphs to come out of 'Don Jon', other than a hilarious supporting performance from Tony Danza playing Jon's father, are the long stretches of back-and-forth's between characters. I must praise Levitt for constructing a script full of scary realistic and ultimately award worthy conversational dialogue. On the other hand, Levitt's direction is this films major (and only) flaw. While it's obvious that the abundance of flashy music video-esque editing ploys he uses serve a purpose, it all comes across as a bit too stylized; a kind of, style before substance. Also, many of the activities preformed by the characters are intentionally over-the-top, but are filmed in a very forced and ultimately contrived way, which gets in the way of a rather interesting story. And I won't even mention the rather abrupt ending (oops, I just did). Final Thought: Overall, 'Don Jon' is one that did surprise me by how much I liked it, in sort of the same way as last year's 'Magic Mike' had; a movie that I was expecting only vapid-ness from, but got a film full of substance and subtext. No, 'Don Jon' isn't as good as 'Magic Mike', but it was better than 'Shame' and that is saying something for a first time writer/director.",8,2,5,3 October 2013
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Pay Attention!
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole Ashland This is as much of an action movie as a film about the Cold War could be. Directed in interlinking fashion (with a very dense story-arc) by Tomas Alfredson (Let the Right One In) and using one of the most well adapted screenplays of 2011 from a rather heavy novel from John le Carre (and also a 1979 British TV mini-series), 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is one of the more well orchestrated mystery/crime/spy drama's to come out of Britain in recent years. Containing a who's who of critically acclaimed English actors (maybe the British response to 'New Year's Eve'); including Mark Strong (Kick-Ass), John Hurt (The Elephant Man, Midnight Express), Toby Jones (My Week With Marilyn), Colin Firth (The King's Speech), Tom Hardy (Warrior) and Gary Oldman (The Dark Knight), this is a film that while well constructed, well acted and should win some kind of award for cinematography and set design (every nuance of this film reeks of 1970's Britain), may work more to confuse and turn off American audiences who are used to films with 'Spy' in the title being drenched with high flying stunts, slickly choreographed shootouts and Tom Cruise. Synopsis: The plot of 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is very elaborate, so I am going to attempt to write a decipherable synopsis without confusing too many people or confusing myself. Set in the Cold War of the 1970's, the story centers around an old and weathered British Operative named George Smiley (Oldman), who upon the death of the head of British Intelligence, is forced to retire. When a hired Hit-man, by the name of Rickey Tarr (Hardy), brings it to the attention of the British Intelligence that a mole is thought to be working within the system and is undeniably a high ranking operative, Smiley is brought back to conduct a sort of internal investigation and flush out said mole. Like any well done who-done-it, this film effortlessly leads audiences through a veritable maze of a tension driven plot (like a subdued British game of Clue), only showing the viewer just enough to suspect to wrong person until the very end. And the final twist does work and is very much worth sitting through storytelling that is not only complex but also nonlinear (which will be the complaint by most who find fault with the movie). Suffice to say, there is no way anybody is going to understand every nuance, plot point or British slang code word in this film after seeing it just once, but that doesn't mean 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' doesn't have a quiet entertainment value, which will sneak up on you (if you like who-done-it espionage films that is). Excellent performances: And my new found love affair with Tom Hardy's acting style continues, after seeing him in 'Bronson', 'Inception' then 'Warrior', as he is excellent in his bit but very pivotal role in this film (and is sure to be bad-ass as Bane in the upcoming 'The Dark Knight Rises'). Another performance of note comes from the ever brilliant but at times overlooked Toby Jones , who should not be looked over this time for his subtle and very smug supporting role as the Scot, Percy Allelne. But, as I said before, every actor does some fairly upstanding work here. The fact that Oldman is being lifted up so highly for his performance as Smiley this awards season is something of a mixed bag of emotions for me, because while he does do a respectable job as the protagonist here, he is pretty much really good in everything he does. His chameleon-like ability to become immersed in a plethora of roles, be it Sirius Black in the Harry Potter series or Lt. Jim Gordon in 'The Dark Knight' or even as Dracula in Francis Ford Coppola's 'Dracula' is magnificent, but in the end it is not his performance in 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' that I didn't find award worthy, it is his character. Despite what many other critics may say, Oldman wasn't memorable here, plain and simple, hence not award worthy. Final Thought: Filled with superb performances, although none are worthy of an Oscar nomination, 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' is an elaborate and very well constructed spy thriller, even with the lack of countless shootouts or highly James Bond-esque choreographed chases. To say this is more along the lines of a British (uber-complicated) 'The Usual Suspects' would be a more accurate assessment. But viewer beware even though I enjoyed this picture, 'Tinker Tailor Solder Spy' is a movie which will make one work for their entertainment. You have to pay attention for the entirety of the 127 minute runtime!

The Adventures of Tintin," I'll take Motion Capture for the win.
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland As if an adventure monster had vomited all over the screen, 'The Adventures of Tintin' is a non-stop adventure film adaptation from a beloved European adventurous comic series. But while it holds that Spielberg-ish Indiana Jones archetype and an all-star cast of voices (including the likes of Daniel Craig, Nick Frost, Simon Pegg and Toby Jones) it does get to a point where if you are not invested in the (over-excitable) Tintin character, then you simply won't care about the story itself (visuals aside). Directed and co-produced by the aforementioned Steven Spielberg (Saving Private Ryan, Catch Me If You Can) and co-produced by visual genius Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King) using the highest caliber stop-motion animation (maybe ever seen), 'The Adventures of Tintin' exhibits the partnership of two great directors, in conjunction with a quirky, yet (at times) only slightly entertaining interpretation of what European children's mysteries are all about. OK, so maybe the reason why I am so lukewarm about this material isn't because it didn't look nice (because it does) or didn't contain an adventurous story (because it does that too); but speaking as an admitted novice to the beloved tales of Tintin, the adventure and the characters all were such that I really felt no attachment to anything on-screen as the million dollar climax approached. In this reviewer's opinion, 'The Adventures of Tintin', while visually stunning, may leave many American audiences with a storyline which they may inevitably become bored with.The story follows an all-too-nosy boy named Tintin, who is (from the visual exposition) a part time reporter, part time amateur sleuth and part time ambiguous teenage nuisance. Within the first two seconds of the film he becomes involved in a storyline centering around an obnoxiously alcoholic Sea-Captain, the sinister Mr. Sakharine (the bad guy) and their quest for a model ship, which is thought to lead to three sought after scrolls, which could lead to some sought after treasure. From there Tintin's adventure sends him and the Captain all over the world, as we soon find out that this young boy's thirst for adventure is only rivaled by the Captain's thirst for alcohol. With action sequences of a fairly high caliber and some of the most illustrious, wide scoping CGI generated landscapes, there is no question that Spielberg knows how to direct the hell out of a film; no matter what genre. Where this film falls apart though is with the actual story and its connection, or lack thereof, with audiences. Spielberg and Jackson assume that everyone going to see a movie about Tintin is familiar, if not a huge fan of the comic series; big mistake. The fact is, 'The Adventures of Tintin' contains almost no back-story and simply hurls the audiences right into a mystery with no real rhyme or reason. And while this may work for the devoted followers of the comic series, for the rest of us, it may feel as if we came into this movie midpoint, thus losing many novice supporters right away. This leads me to the character development. The characters, do tend to get rather annoying, especially because with little set-up it is hard to build connections with any of them. In fact the only character I cared about was the dog, who constantly held a Disney-esque animal lovability throughout. As for Tintin, audiences will either love or hate his personality almost immediately, and the Captain, brilliantly performed by Andy Serkis (or as I like to call him, the future of Hollywood) is a character so dumb and buffoonish that he is, for the most part, unlikable. Long story short, 'The Adventures of Tintin' is not a movie one walks into disinterested in the Tintincharacter and walks out interested in Tintin's plight.Final Thought: 'The Adventures of Tintin' may not hold the funniest storyline (with tons of Euro humor), but is clearly, on a purely technical level, one of the best animated films of the year (even though some critics will whine about their love for the forgettable 'Rango'). Why this movie was snubbed from an Academy Awards nomination for Best Animated Film, may serve to be the biggest snub of the season. In saying that, on a purely entertainment level, allow me to reiterate that 'The Adventures of Tintin' is just OK. And if me saying that has angered you to the point that you decide to leave me a drawn-out comment on how I am just a stupid American or about how you loved reading the Tintin comics as a child, thus if I would have read them then I would have understood the film better, I will have to stop you there because I am only here to review the content of the film itself, not the comic.

Fast & Furious 6," Bizarro World
","Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson is officially the new Arnold Schwarzenegger. But more importantly, the person in charge of keeping The Rock bicep-deep in arm butter should get some Executive Producer credits and be deemed the new hardest working man in Hollywood.Under the direction of Justin Lin, 'Fast & Furious 6' sees the return of almost everyone from 'Fast Five'; including Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto, Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner, Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, etc. as they come together for one last job...again. Also joining the crew is Gina Carano as Hobbs' assistant (and my future wife) who is apparently given free rein to go MMA on everyone she sees fit. And returning (because she's got nothing better to do) is Michelle Rodriguez, in a storyline less focused on, the better.Synopsis: Duhhhhhh.Fast cars go fast.Why the movie works: This is clearly Lin's best visual stab at the franchise yet, as he not only creates the best things-blow-up climax to come out of any of these films, but also (for the second time in a row) gives his audiences exactly what they came to see. Lin does a brilliant job of making sure there is either a car driving fast, a woman in a bikini, or the Rock giving someone the people's eyebrow and spouting off something fantastically WWE-ish, on the screen at all times. In fact, he has done so well with guiding this franchise into the realm of highly entertaining B movie fluff, that it is a wonder why he is being replaced by horror director James Wan for the upcoming 'Fast & Furious 7'.Side Note: I realize Lin did direct both 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift' and 'Fast & Furious' as well, but let's be honest, those movies are better left forgotten.Final Thought: Aside from the fact that 'Fast & Furious 6' is a tad too long, that Vin Diesel still calls what he does acting, that there is an odd body distortion phenomenon which happens when Diesel and The Rock stand next to each other and that the storyline doesn't really matter (especially the more sentimental sections) I'm not ashamed to say that I was thoroughly entertained as I walked out of the theater. And while I realize that this is a lot to look past, if you are the type to spend your hard earned money on a movie entitled 'Fast & Furious 6'; a movie which is filled with unbelievable, yet well constructed, high flying, auto-centric stunts and enough comic relief to get the casual fan through, then this installment is clearly worth watching.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

The Town," The Town: Boston must be the most dangerous place on earth.
","With intense stylized action and a suspenseful pace, 'The Town' shows (once again) how gritty and violent life in Boston can be. In Ben Affleck's (Pearl Harbor) first attempt behind the camera, he seems to have struck gold doing what he does best, a film that highlights his home turf. Starring Jon Hamm (Mad Men), Rebecca Hall (Vicky Cristina Barcelona), Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker), Blake Lively (The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants) and Affleck himself in the starring role, 'The Town' continues the legacy of Boston crime genres. And the end result? Worth seeing, but not quite best picture award winning caliber. In fact, this is the type of movie that may alienate some viewers into thinking that maybe they didn't like it as much because they didn't grow up rooting for the Red Socks.'The Town' centers around what was said to have been one of the most crime ridden towns in America, Charlestown, Massachusetts. Doug MacRay (Affleck) and James Coughlin (Renner) were childhood friends and, as adults, are now apart of a long legacy of criminals to come out of Charlestown. After one bank robbery, in particular, MacRay becomes infatuated with the bank manager (Hall) and (what do you know) she happens to be the only one who can connect MacRay and Coughlin to the robbery. The one person who can send MacRay and Coughlin to prison for life, but will she do it? Or will love supersede all? Yeah, by the end this movie does get a little too sappy for its own good.'The Town' is a throw back to the look and feel of movies like 'Heat' or 'Training Day' (just not as developed as those examples). The problem here, aside from the so-so written script, is that half way through the film the love story between the bank manager and MacRay takes over the story. In saying that, this film is still worth seeing.The huge buzz around this film may be because this is Affleck's directorial debut (yes, he should have been nominated for best director) and Jon Hamm's feature film debut (who is nothing special here. Do you hear what I said, all you fans of 'Mad Men'!?), but Renner and Lively are the real reasons for this films success. Lively gives a performance (as small as it is) that will remind audiences of how multi-faceted of an actress she is. As for Renner, he absolutely out acts everybody on screen. He needs to be nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor. If anything, he is better here than he was in 'The Hurt Locker'.Final Thought: This may not be up to par with 'The Departed' or movies of its own Bostonian crime genre, but I will say that for its few shortcomings 'The Town' is the most underrated film of 2010. Affleck's directing style is that of a seasoned vet. The storyline may have turned from action film to melodrama all too easily for some who expected more action, but don't let that stop you from renting this very good film.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Suicide Squad," Stop using comic books to defend this movie!
","This wanted to be 'Guardians of the Galaxy' so bad!As the most teased and advertised movie of the year, even with a tsunami of negative early reviews, the 'Suicide Squad' hype train was not to be derailed; which meant: No matter what the reviews said, I was still going to see this movie. That said, does this film live up to the hype? Synopsis: Telling the story of a group of incarcerated supervillains who are rounded up (for reasons unknown) by the government (instead for recruiting actual soldiers; again, 'for reasons unknown') and made to battle a villainous witch (who wasn't even a threat until after said villains were 'rounded up'). Now if that sounds like a movie you want to see, then read on and let's see if I can't break your spirit. Director David Ayer's style (Training Day, End of Watch) is completely lost in a movie that looks like it was edited by producers into a mishmash of nonsensical cuts, flashbacks and one on-the-nose song after another. This outcome results in a lackluster plot jumble in conjunction with nonsensical character motivations, in equal amounts. I get why a supervillain would be forced to help the government, but (spoiler alert) there comes a point when they don't have to, BUT DO IT ANYWAY! (insert head-scratching emoji here). While Deadshot (Will Smith) and Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) do work as entertaining leads, the Joker (played by Jared Leto in an absolutely forgettable performance) is made to look like a Juggalo electronic-dance DJ inspired pimp, whose motivations include wearing purple fur coats and running around the city with no shirt on, showing off his abs. The Joker I KNOW was all about chaos. That's what makes him scary; the fact that he isn't much for 'feelings' and doesn't wear a frightening amount of bling-bling. But I guess it's 2016 and this is what we get; a Joker feat. Skrillex. As for all of the other B-side villains, they are complete throwaways. Final Thought: As much as I enjoyed 'Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice' (I know I'm in the minority here) 'Suicide Squad' may be looked back upon as the beginning of the end for this particular cinematic DC universe. So, let me be the first to say it: RIP, DC.",3,2,4,7 August 2016
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," From the directors of 'You, Me and Dupree'
","After director Joe Johnston's savagely disappointing attempt to bring the Marvel superhero Captain America to life three years ago, the creative minds that brought us 'You, Me and Dupree' (Anthony and Joe Russo) somehow get a crack at the sequel, 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier'. Though it sounds like I'm ready to rip this movie, to my surprise 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' was (for the most part) quite entertaining, with visually stunning action sequences throughout. But even more surprising, especially because this was made by the guys who directed 'You, Me and Dupree' (I don't know if I mentioned that disturbing bit of trivia already) is how this theatrical release also contains much more well timed laughs than I bargained for.If I'm not mistaken, Captain America is less of a goody goody and more of a 'bad ass' in this installment. Right away we get to see him in action, throwing people around and basically kicking major butt. Thus, a huge reason as to why 'The Winter Soldier' works as well as it does, has a lot to do with the directors keeping the octane at a relatively high level and not boring me to tears. Any real flaws here (and there are a few) would only be noticed by audiences who attempted to actually break the plot down.The Synopsis: Just as Captain America aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) has nearly adapted to life in the modern world, a beaten and bloodied Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) shows up in his apartment, where we learn that S.H.I.E.L.D has been compromised by a villain from Captain America's past. He is also confronted by a bad guy who goes by the name of the Winter Soldier, whose strengths seem to match up suspiciously well to that of the Captain's. The story itself is pretty good, even though it is bogged down with a lot of double and triple cross espionage-type twists and turns that I didn't quite understand. But much like the last Iron Man film, where 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' runs into trouble is with its villains; one played by Robert Redford and the other the aforementioned mysterious Winter Soldier. Even though the movie starts out with an awesome fight sequence between the Captain and George St. Pierre, the main villain is an old man named Alexander Pierce (Redford) who spends the whole movie in one room and the other is the infamous Winter Soldier, who is made to look pretty intimidating for a while (again, kudos to the direction) playing an evil version of Captain America. But even his storyline leads to revelations which softened his villainous exterior and a final battle which left me cold and wishing that I could fast forward to the post credits teaser clip. The fact is, for having his name included in the title, the Greek tragedy-esque connections between Captain America and the Winter Soldier was far more fascinating than actually watching the Winter Soldier do anything; which is a problem.Side Note: I guess I must mention that this film also stars Scarlet Johansson, who by design plays a huge role, reprising her character, Black Widow. As if audiences had demanded she get more screen-time, Johansson is in 80% of the movie, wearing her signature form fitting one piece and seducing every male 'bad guy' to nearly an inch of their lives. Anthony Mackie is also in this playing the Falcon, a sort of side kick to the title character. He flies around and stuff, but that's about it. Moving on.Final Thought: 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' is impressive for a Marvel sequel, but still (as far as Marvel films go) its more along the lines of the first Thor film than the first Iron Man film, mainly because the character of Steve Rogers is still very two dimensional. And before I get hate mail, this is not a direct knock on the movie, but more so of the character himself. I understand that the 'total good' characteristic of Captain America is by design. My point is, I don't believe it translates all that well to audiences who nowadays would rather see a shades of grey antihero, than an old school hero whose morals are impervious to a dynamic character arc.",7,0,2,10 April 2014
Life of Pi," Visual Orgasm
","As aesthetically stunning as its trailers suggests, Ang Lee's 'Life of Pi' (or, as I call it, 'Indian Castaway') is no doubt the work of the most impressive cinematography/director duo of the year. In saying that, while visually Lee makes the meat of this adaptation sing, like many critics have stated before me, not every great novel (which Yann Martel's 'Life of Pi' is) can be translated into a fully entertaining piece of cinema; no matter how talented the director, or how faithful Lee's vision of 'Life of Pi' actually is.The Plot: If you haven't read the book, 'Life of Pi' tells the story of a young man that goes by the nickname Pi, whose family owns a zoo in India. Events (concerning taxes or something) cause his family, including all of the animals, to relocate to Canada, via huge freighter. But when they run into a storm, that leaves Pi stranded on a lifeboat, in the middle of the ocean, with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and a Bengal tiger named RICHARD PARKER, his chances of survival look grim at best. But wait, Pi is narrating the film, so he had to have made itright? OK, to tell you the truth, I was rather bored for the initial 30 minutes, which consisted of 100% conversational exposition. But when the storm happens, everything changes. It isn't until the story moves out onto the water that it begins to take on the visual form that audiences paid for. And during this massive section, Lee doesn't disappoint, creating nearly an hour and a half of mind-blowing, million dollar visuals (at times it is hard to tell what is real and what is computer generated) with an understated suspenseful atmosphere throughout, that will have audiences on the edge of their seats for most of it.And now for the bad stuff (when pertaining to the adaptation aspect): When I initially read the novel back in high school, the religiously curious, philosophical and man vs. man aspects that the character of Pi is infatuated with in the first part of the novel, reads much better than anything David Magee's screenplay or Lee could combine to manifest on screen; through no fault of their own. But maybe the most standout issue with adapting a book like 'Life of Pi' arises when sitting down and actually watching this film's resolution. This final ten minutes, taken from (in my opinion) the most intriguing portion of the novel, will come across to a viewing audience as less morbidly engaging, and more lackluster and kid friendly than those who read the book might expect. But then again, I am not reviewing the book, am I? Side Note: I should also make it a point to say that, because a majority of 'Life of Pi' is a one man show, Suraj Sharma, who plays Pi, should get tons of credit for pulling off a rather impressive performance. A performance that will surely be taken for granted because of what Lee pulls off behind the camera.Final Thought: I can't state enough how the monumentally impressive visuals here have laid down the gauntlet for all future CGI based films. So, if the CGI is the only reason you came to see 'Life of Pi', you won't be disappointed, as this is clearly the most visually gratifying film of the year, with visuals that will undoubtedly lead to an Oscar nomination for best picture. Yes, some of the sequences come off as slow, the ending, while faithful to the source material, seems more like a cop-out than anything, and at times Lee asks audiences for a suspension of belief that they may not be willing to give, but with a movie that holds its award worthy visuals paramount, 'Life of Pi' is (for the most part) an entertaining success and worth seeing.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Interstellar," Ghost Protocol
","There are moments during 'Interstellar' which may be compared to '2001: A Space Odyssey' (a better movie). There are moments during 'Interstellar' which may be compared to 'Prometheus' (also, a better movie). There are even moments and storytelling techniques within 'Interstellar' that are completely ripped off from 'Inception' (a much better movie, from Christopher Nolan himself). That said, 'Interstellar' should still be touted as the most ambitious film of the year so far, and in the same breath, should ultimately go down as one of director Christopher Nolan's worst films to date.This highly anticipated Nolan project depicts a future riddled with dust storms, where the world's food supply is nearly depleted (or at least 40 to 60 years out from being depleted, but that doesn't sound nearly as dire) where astronauts are working as farmers and children are taught that the Apollo space missions were faked. During this time, an underground government institution called NASA commissions a group of astronauts (including Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway) for a top secret space mission. This mission will have them traveling through a newly discovered wormhole, with the promise of finding another inhabitable world.OK, let's get right to it. Any praise I heap upon this movie will be directed at the final 90 minutes of this two hour and 49 minute long film, since the first 80 or so minutes of 'Interstellar' (while absolutely gorgeous at times to behold) is drenched in sequences of McConaughey seemingly reenacting moments from those pretentious Lincoln car ads, caught in a continuous and almost finger wagging diatribe about how the human race was never meant to die on earth, which nearly put me to sleep. In other words, the first half of this is as slow and lifeless as watching a dead astronaut drift through space. Anyway, this is Intersellar's fatal flaw, since the latter half is ripe with big budget yet very symbolic action sequences, stunning cinematography and fascinating talking points dealing with the nature of human survival in the face of an unsympathetic universe, due to some really insightful slabs of dialogue from a script written by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan. Even the literal rocket science lingo becomes more and more palatable as the 'gravity' of this plot begins to set in, near the midpoint of Act 2.Final Thought/The Ending: Allow me to take a quick spoiler free moment to discuss this ending. During the final act of 'Interstellar', for most film nerds, Nolan's story will be encroaching on the hallowed grounds of Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey'. Some will admire the sheer ballsyness of what he does in this pivotal moment and others will find it in bad taste. Though this is not a huge issue, since I don't believe this niche group will have much effect on ticket sales, the problem is that for the millions who didn't see 'Interstellar' for any film school aesthetic reason, Nolan's ending will simply come off as so strange and obnoxiously far-fetched, that many may leave the theater angry that the punch-line wasn't worth the nearly three hour set up.",6,15,29,13 November 2014
Silver Linings Playbook," All Eagles fans are nuts!
","I really enjoyed this romantic comedydespite the fact that I'm a Cowboys fan (and that's saying a lot).Maintaining an overall tone that is both dark and witty, while at the same time quite touching and genuine, 'Silver Linings Playbook', aside from being my early pick for best ensemble cast of the year, proves (once again) that even though writer/director David O. Russell is responsible for 'I Heart Huckabees', there is still hope for him as a filmmaker (and no, I didn't like 'The Fighter'). Using the backdrop of an eccentric Philadelphia community obsessed with the Philadelphia Eagles, this movie tells the story of a man who is recently checked out of a mental institution (played by Bradley Cooper) by his mother. In an attempt at a fresh start and with hopes of getting back together with his ex- wife, he must illicit the help of a widow, who might be crazier than him (brilliantly played by Jennifer Lawrence). 'Silver Linings Playbook' is a breath of fresh air within a genre that is normally riddled with predictable Harlequin romances, starring a neutered Zac Efron or crying Channing Tatum. In short, in case you didn't know that these kind of films existed, this is a romantic comedy that in turn, is also a very good movie. As far as comedic entertainment value goes, 'Silver Linings Playbook' isn't always laugh out loud funny, but makes up for it by having an extremely well crafted storyline, with its entertainment roots strongly grounded (for the most part) in reality. And this aspect is only accentuated about 30 minutes in by the chemistry that Lawrence and Cooper bring to the screen, as they interact in some of the most genuinely intriguing back and forth's seen in any film this year; in any genre. While I'm on the subject, allow me take some time out to elaborate on some of the standout performances in this film. First off, Cooper gives a performance that finally proves that he can act (calm down everybody, 'Limitless' wasn't all that) playing a character with mental illness in very Jack Nicholson-esque fashion (not an award worthy performance, but still pretty damn interesting to watch). I must also make it a point to say that Chris Tucker, who only plays a bit role as the seemingly pointless token black friend character, plays it with such enthusiasm, injecting much needed doses of comedy sporadically throughout the movie, that by the end, he may have many audiences asking themselves 'where has Chris Tucker been for the past decade?' And maybe the most surprising aspect of this movie is how, after an assortment of awful career choices (to the point where nobody under 18 thinks of him as one of the greatest actors of all time) Robert De Niro, playing the father with OCD, finally gives a performance that doesn't feel like he's phoning it in. As for the most stand-out performance, the award goes to Jennifer Lawrence (see what I did there?) giving the BEST PERFORMANCE OF HER CAREER! You heard me. That's right 'Winter's Bone'/Sundance snobs! As the equally eccentric (and ex-slut) foil to Cooper's character, Lawrence plays the role with unabashed vigor and something to prove, in a performance which will hopefully garner enough attention from the Academy to obtain another Best Actress nomination; but this time, for a good movie. The only hiccups in 'Silver Linings Playbook' occur in its final act, when a lot of the genuineness is lost, as the story becomes a sort of contrivance; BUT an entertaining contrivance. What all of that means is, the generic romantic comedy pot hole which this movie falls into in the final 20 minutes (having to do with drastic life choices being solved with a competition) will probably be dismissed because of everything good that proceeded it. Final Thought: From the lively acting, to the gritty low-budget feel that O. Russell brings to the screen, to a script ripe with undeniable believability (also adapted for the screen by O. Russell) 'Silver Linings Playbook' is no doubt the best romantic comedy of the year. And, as I alluded to before, is a film which in every way supersedes the chick-flick, Katherine Heigl norm, translating into a date night movie which can be enjoyed by either sex; and even by the Bradley Cooper fans who think 'The Hangover' was 'the greatest movie ever, Bro!'

The Amazing Spider-Man," His only weakness is the ladies.
","Entertaining, but very unimpressive, the Spider-Man franchise reboot 'The Amazing Spider-Man' may only be interesting for anybody under the age of ten. Working with an average script (containing too many one liners for my taste) Marc Webb directs this version with a CGI first mentality, which does become overwhelmingly distracting over time. In Webb's version, Spider-Manwell, if you don't know the story of Spider-Man by now then you probably have a life and aren't going to see this version anyway; therefore, I'm not going to waste ink explaining it to you now. So, if you are familiar with the 2002 version, the only elements that differ in this latest version are as follows: scenes which develop more of an origin story dealing with Peter Parkers parents, Peter Parker's relationship with Gwen Stacy (as it was in the original comic) and Spider-Man (played by Andrew Garfield) and his battle against one of the lamest villains in the series: Dr. Curt Conners aka The Lizard (who isn't even wearing the signature white lab coat). I will say this, if you are expecting a darker remake, you will be sorely disappointed. If anything Raimi's version was darker and this one is much more kid friendly. So let's get to the point; does the heavy CGI and the slightly revamped storyline set 'The Amazing Spider-Man' apart as one of the best summer super hero films in recent years? No, not really. Simply stated, as a Marvel superhero film, it falls somewhere under 'The Avengers' or 'Iron Man', but still ranks higher than the catastrophe that was 'Captain America: The First Avenger'.OK, so this isn't so bad, in fact it was more or less entertaining throughout, due to some funny bits of dialogue and engaging performances from the entire ensemble. The problem here, which will resonate time and time again in the minds of anyone who sees 'The Amazing Spider-Man', is how this reboot isn't on the same level as the 2002 version, and furthermore doesn't even attempt to set itself apart from that version, as a good reboot should. I hate to constantly be comparing this version to Raimi's 2002 version, because I'd rather review this title on its own merits, BUT since 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is only ten years removed from a far too similar version (and only five years removed from 'Spider-Man 3'), I would be pretty naive to even attempt to avoid comparisons to 'Spider-Man'. So, let me get this comparison thing over with now: 1. Toby Maguire (Seabiscuit) plays a better (nerdier looking) Spider-Man than Andrew Garfield (even though Garfield is remarkably believable as a teenager).2. Sam Raimi's vision compared to Marc Webb's by the numbers, CGI driven (befitting a Green Lantern sequel) film, was truly the sign of a more accomplished director who wanted to do something different with the beloved Spider-Man character. In short, Webb's version looks like the old one, and Raimi's looks like the revamped, more stylized, reboot.3. The witty writing style of David Koepp (Mission: Impossible, Angels and Demons) definitely was a huge factor in bringing the 2002 version out of the cartoonish television realm. As for the playful screenplay, which really brought 'The Amazing Spider-Man' back down to a more child-friendly level, written by the team of James Vanderbilt, Alvin Sargent and Steve Kloves, while does tell a more accurate story, doesn't contain the same level of life Koepp's script had (I don't know how else to say it).The fact is that the only real improvement from 'Spider-Man' to 'The Amazing Spider-Man' is the performance of Emma Stone playing Gwen Stacy, which is a substantial improvement over Kirsten Dunst (Marie Antoinette) as Mary Jane Watson. So, there you have it, 2002's 'Spider-Man' was an all around better version and I challenge anyone to argue against anything I've just said.Side Note: The problem with rebooting an immensely successful franchise not a decade afterwards, is that unless it is remade to be so drastically different in story or tone (aka what Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight series did for the Batman legacy) it will always be seen as a disappointment or simply unnecessary. In fact, the way this film plays out, a strong argument could be made that the ONLY REASON a new Spider-Man film was made at all (and so soon) was because Sam Raimi's speculated 'Spider-Man 4' catastrophically fell apart a few years ago.Final Thought: While I do commend these filmmakers for attempting to bring forth a Spider-Man remake whose story is almost entirely built off of the 'The Amazing Spider-Man' comic books (a storyline all but ignored in the Raimi's trilogy) I still don't believe that that is a strong enough reason as to why this reboot/remake needed to be made, or watched (by anybody not into superhero films) for that matter. Also to make things worse, there is no need to stay for the teaser after the final credits roll, as it's one of the most disappointing and confusing since the inception of the superhero end credit teasers.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

The Lego Movie," A movie parents will enjoy more than their children.
","Don't worry, this is not just a nostalgia movie catering to the retro LEGO nerd, while alienating anybody who had video games or friends growing up. 'The Lego Movie' is shockingly entertaining, even if you're like me and the only LEGO interaction you've ever had is that one time when you accidentally stepped barefoot on one of your little brothers LEGO pieces.Side Note: Yes, I am aware that there are Lego video games, but those are lame, so Containing Star Wars LEGO jokes, Harry Potter LEGO jokes, Ninja Turtle LEGO jokes and Superhero (The Justice League) LEGO jokes (with LEGO Batman (voiced by Will Arnett) portrayed accurately as a jerk, or how a billionaire playboy turned Superhero would most likely act in real life) 'The Lego Movie' is from the minds of writer/director duo Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (the writer/directors of such child friendly films as 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs' and'21 Jump Street').Synopsis: An average construction worker LEGO man (voiced by Chris Pratt) is mistaken for a LEGO prophet after stumbling upon a mysterious piece of plastic known as 'The Piece of Resistance' and then asked to save the LEGO universe from the tyrannical President Business (voiced by Will Ferrell). To tell you the truth, I was actually dreading going to see 'The Lego Movie', after taking one glance at the trailer and believing that it was just another animated, early year, straight to DVD release that the studios were attempting to masquerade as a feature film. BUT, to my surprise, what I got was an animated feature which contained the foundation of an extremely clever script riddled with laugh-out-loud dialogue, together with quite impressive LEGO inspired visuals (LEGO-mation) that while does take a few moments to adjust to, should force this film into the awards conversation next year.Caveat: Chances are 'The Lego Movie' will be more entertaining for adults than small children, and here's why: Written by the guys who wrote and directed '21 Jump Street', most of the jokes caught me off guard with how comically sharp they were, but after a while I did notice numerous children, in the theater I was in, becoming visibly bored with the witty banter, while their parents continued to laugh out loud until the final credits rolled. Something to think about if you are planning on taking your little one.Final Thought (Caveat # 2): As funny as 'The Lego Movie' is, it is also hampered by an overly sentimental and tonally misguided ending, which takes most of the wind out of the sails of the final twenty minutes. This was actually the biggest problem I had with the film, even getting to the point of openly wishing it would end, just so I wouldn't have to witness one more second of Will Ferrell showing off his non-range as a dramatic actor. Still, if you are a fan of LEGO's or any offshoot of LEGO brand video games, then you will more than likely be able to outright ignore any flaws 'The Lego Movie' has to offer.",7,0,1,15 February 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," If you thought Matthew McConaughey was skinny in 'Mud'
","These past two years have seen Matthew McConaughey go from B-list comedic actor, to arguably one of the top ten dramatic actors working today. And undoubtedly an Oscar nomination awaits McConaughey for this performance.My extremely long synopsis: In the mid 80's, coinciding with the emergence of the drug AZT, a stereotypical homophobic Texas redneck named Ron Woodroof is informed by doctors that he is HIV positive and has thirty days to live. However, when he discovers that AZT does much more harm than good and the drugs that seem to be helping people are essentially illegal, he goes to Mexico for treatment. And upon discovering there is profit to be made off of the sale of non-FDA approved drugs that actually work, he decides to smuggle in the drugs and go head to head with Big Pharma by starting the Dallas Buyers Club (with the help of a homosexual cross-dresser played by Jared Leto) a club which provides its members (AIDS patients) with alternative medicine. There is also a pseudo-love story subplot concerning Ron and a doctor, played by Jennifer Garner, but it doesn't add anything to the story, so who cares.Another aspect which adds little to the success of this film is the direction from Jean-Marc Vallee. Yet I don't count on many other critics making that statement in their reviews since McConaughey's physical transformation as well as his performance is such a welcome distraction, that it takes pressure off everyone else in this production.Problems do arise when, on more than a few occasions, the script sets up a lighter comedic atmosphere than appropriate, considering the subject matter. That said, when Leto's character is introduced into the story (around 40 minutes in) even though he does play the comic relief of sorts, 'Dallas Buyers Club' seems to become less about the comedy and wit and more about the dramatic entertainment. Furthermore, while critics will be going gaga over McConaughey's performance (as they should) Leto's great supporting performance demands to be recognized. Why he doesn't focus solely on acting and give up on that horrible band of his, is beyond me.Side Note: Yes, 'Dallas Buyers Club' is entertaining, touching and even powerful at times, but with the story's focus being what it is, this is a movie that will still come under understandable scrutiny for one reason in particular: Much like 'The Help', the hero of 'Dallas Buyers Club' is an outsider. What I mean by that is, in some people's eyes 'The Dallas Buyers Club' will be nothing more than a movie about a homophobic cowboy with a heart of gold, who must come to the rescue of the poor, helpless homosexuals. And sadly because the plot and characters aren't really that layered, this criticism is unavoidable even though the movie itself may work.Final Thought: Overall, 'Dallas Buyers Club' is a four star film, with a couple of five star performances.",8,3,5,19 November 2013
Goon," A Canadian film about violence?!
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Containing one of the most simplistic story lines in recent movie history, befitting the attention span of hockey fans, 'Goon' surprisingly is a film which displays a comedic chemistry that is not only constantly funny and entertaining, but, at the end of the day, is only one step below a film the caliber of 'Slap Shot'.Forgettably directed by Canadian born Michael Dowse (Take Me Home Tonight), but brilliantly adapted by Canadians Jay Baruchel (The Sorcerer's Apprentice) and Evan Goldberg (Superbad), from a novel by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith, 'Goon' stars Seann William Scott (American Pie) and is based on the true story of Doug Glatt. If you don't know who Doug Glatt is, it's OK. You'll probably never hear about him again. Doug is a somewhat timid and dumb bartender, who is uniquely used as an enforcer of sorts. One day, during a hockey game, Doug, accompanied by his friend (played by Baruchel) gets into a fight in the stands, which goes viral. Literally moments later (around 12 minutes into the movie) Doug is recruited to play semi-pro Hockey in Canada, not for any hockey skills he may have, but more for his ability to throw down. And just like that, he becomes a star.A half hour into 'Goon', it becomes quite evident of how the director's best friend in the first act is the sports montage. If you don't get my analogy, what I mean is that 'Goon' is working with the absolute minimal amount of exposition. Also, in almost an attempt to extend the plot, there is semi endearing love story which occurs between Doug and Eva, the exceptionally well written female hockey groupie, which flows pretty well with the story, but is nothing new.Sounds like I really didn't care for this movie, right? Well, for a while I didn't, but then 'Goon' began to focus less on the dimwitted Doug character and incorporate more and more of his teammates. And with that comes the most comically intriguing and well written aspect of this film; the quirky (and very raunchy) side characters and the interactions they have with each other. These supporting players did more than give 'Goon' a necessary comic distraction from the one dimensional Doug, they gave an entirely new life to a film which was gearing up to be as forgettable as 'She's out of My League'. At times, scenes within 'Goon' play out like 'Major League', aka a superbly written buddy team comedy, with very unusually outlandish personalities, which will undoubtedly keep audiences invested in the characters, even if they are not interested at all in the subject matter.Furthermore, critics may be giving Scott way too much credit here. Although he does play the sympathetic dullard (the Rocky archetype) fairly well, the character itself grows tiresome fast. In all actuality, it is a mixture of a very funny supporting cast and some fantastic writing from Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg that keeps the hum drum plot line quite entertaining.Final Thought: All jokes aside, if you don't know me personally, and couldn't tell by now, I am not a hockey fan AT ALL. So, the fact that I, above all others, am recommending 'Goon' means that this is one movie that truly transcends sports all together. Yes, there are a few inside jokes, which one either has to be a huge hockey fan or from Canada to understand, but overall, 'Goon' is a film that, even if one doesn't like sports (or likes real sports, such as football or basketball) many will find themselves being pleasantly surprised.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

X-Men: Days of Future Past," Back to the FuturePast
","Just a forewarning, this is not the type of review where I will attempt to dissect how faithful this film was to its comic book source material, because for one: I don't have the Marvel universe knowledge to even begin to argue with fanboys who attempt to pick apart my review based on semantics, which have nothing to do with anything cinematic, and secondly: I simply don't care. My only job is to judge what I saw on screen. And what I saw on screen was a film which, in my opinion, currently ranks as one of the greatest superhero movies set in the Marvel universe.Synopsis: In a not too distant post apocalyptic future, where most mutants have been eradicated, Wolverine (Huge Jackman) Professor X (Patrick Stewart) Magneto (Ian McKellen) Kitty Pryde (Ellen Page) Storm (Halle Berry) and a few other (lesser) superheroes find themselves cornered, with enemies quickly approaching. These new enemies are called Sentinels and they are the brainchild of Dr. Bolivar Trask (Peter Dinklage). These mutant hunting robots where obviously designed to seek out and destroy all mutants and more importantly constructed in such a way that, in large groups, they are virtually unbeatable. With death assuredly in their near future, the surviving X-Men's only choice is to send Wolverine back in time (for some reason, with no clothes on) to the inception of the Sentinel (the 1970's) in order to reunite young Professor X (James McAvoy) young Magneto (Michael Fassbender) and Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) and find a way to modify history; hence the title. And before I move on, I must take a moment to say that, yes, the acting from top to bottom was as good as the star studded line up would have you believe.You can go ahead and forget about 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' (the two films which nearly killed the once proud X-Men franchise). Brought back from an eleven year hiatus to direct this X-Men/'X-Men: First Class' tie-together, through impressive direction, with the help of a strong screenplay (containing just the right amount of characters) from Simon Kinberg, Bryan Singer fully reestablishes the X-Men franchise as the best superhero movie franchise still running. So, whether or not Singer is found guilty of the alleged teenage sexual abuse of Michael Egan, the man knows his way around an X-Men movie. TOO SOON! In 'X-Men: Days of Future Past' I recognized a lot of the same aspects that once had me proclaiming 'X-Men' and 'X2' to be my favorite superhero movies of all time (before the arrival of the Dark Knight series, of course). Displaying clever banter between fully realized characters, a superb storyline full of social subtext while finding a nice balance between campy dramatization and Dark Knight seriousness, action packed visuals stemming from a variety of superheroes with a variety of super powers, accented with some skilled direction, and new and innovative ways to intertwine Marvel history with actual historical events, the amount of thought and care put into this production was palpable.Final Thought: If I wanted to make this review even longer, I could wax on about the set design, which is pretty award worthy in and of itself. Or I could write another 700 words on how brilliantly choreographed the Jim Croce scored Quicksilver fight sequence was. But by this time you've undoubtedly made up your mind as to whether or not you will be going to see 'X-Men: Days of Future Past'. So I'll leave you with one last note: If you know what you're seeing, the post credits teaser will be the greatest so far. And for those of you think I'm wrong, please don't defend your argument by bringing up that stupid Avengers shawarma scene.",9,0,0,26 May 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Pretty Civil
","With a first half that is little more than an overlong political drama and a second half filled with huge action, Whedon-esque quips from a multitude of super-cameos; capped off with a single (masterful) revelation sequence, the main reason 'Captain America: Civil War' only garners 7 stars has to do with a finale whereHow do I say this without spoiling things?...'Captain America: Civil War', a movie which contains the epic Iron Man vs. Captain America confrontation; a confrontation which has been at least four films in the making, settles on a resolution that can only be described as 'civil'.Synopsis: Do the Avengers do more harm than good? NATO thinks so, as they petition to garner control of this super-group, after global outcry from citizens who were a part of the collateral damage seen in the last two Avengers films, request governmental restraint on the independently run team. This diplomatic plot device divides the group; with unresolved results.Is it me or did that plot seem way too CNN for a superhero movie? Well, that's because it was. And the deeper into the political well the extremely talkie 'Civil War' fell into, the harder it became for me to wrap my mind around the fact that I potentially could be stuck watching an entire superhero film consisting of a series of repetitive moral and ethical roundtable discussions for 2 ½ hours.Mid-Second Act, with the emergence of cameos from Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman) Ant-Man (Paul Rudd)and the new Spider-Man (Tom Holland) who was shockingly the best part of the film, 'Civil War' becomes the action packed superhero movie I'd been promised. During these moments (and only during these moments) do directors Anthony and Joe Russo shine. It just took so long to get there, as the plot did not warrant the pacing displayed within the first hour or so.And it all seemed to be going well. I was now entertained. During the final Act I had become immersed in a Greek tragedy plot twist which had me leaning forward in my seat (essentially in a bloodlust). And then Bottom line, the conclusion to this film was surprisingly tame.Final Thought: Not only was 'Captain America: Winter Soldier' a better movie, but so was 'Batman v. Superman'.",7,2,6,16 May 2016
The Conjuring 2," 'The Conjuring 2' review
","James Wan is back to direct a second tale depicting paranormal researchers/ghost hunters Ed (Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) Warren. But is it as scary as 'The Conjuring'? Synopsis: In the 1970's Ed and Lorraine travel to England to investigate a haunting which locals refer to as London's Amityville. The Good: For the first hour, 'The Conjuring 2' does almost everything right. Even though director James Wan essentially uses the same horror buildup's, which lead to the same jump-scares and thus the same cranked up to 11 horror musical cues, that he always does; he does it all so well many may argue that Wan has created his own official horror style; a style which holds the highest rate of effectiveness in the genre. It's as though with every movie he's teaching a master-class in cookie-cutter horror direction, but does it better and more effectively than anyone working today. The Bad: Little by little, there emerges this love story aspect between Ed and Lorraine. This love story is pushed along by some of the worst dialogue I've heard outside of a Harlequin romance. As this aspect moves to the forefront of the story, it becomes more cringe-inducing, reaching the point where every time Ed and Lorraine pause, turn and tell each other something unbearably lovey dovey, I couldn't help but imagine that the latter half of 'The Conjuring 2' would essentially be the movie Nicholas Sparks would make if he tried his hand at the horror film genre. Along with said love story, there also emerged another questionable aspect which stops this film dead in its tracks time and time again. 'The Conjuring 2' becomes a religious film; or at least contains a very religious undertone. I understand that movies dealing with hauntings and exorcisms go hand in hand with priest and bible verses, but this is different. I would almost liken the religious undertones this film takes on to movies like 'Do You Believe?', 'Fireproof' or 'Courageous'; films which seem like dramatic genre pieces, but end up morphing into Sunday School lessons. This aspect isn't a bad thing, on face value. But much like the love story aspect, wholesome religious rhetoric seems way out of place in a film of this nature. That said, there will be many who will be able to look past the sappiness and the Sunday School level preaching. But even if that's the case, screenwriter Carey Hayes has one more surprise in store for those who reach the 2 hour mark; an ending which in its own right is idiotically simplistic, but whose explanation is so convoluted that as it begins, I looked down at the time and recoiled in horror at how long I'd been sitting there. Final Thought: Do you remember 'Insidious: Chapter 2'? I don't and (looking back on my article) I gave it a positive review. That's what 'The Conjuring 2' is. Even if you enjoy this overlong British version of its predecessor (just with more religious asides and a painfully sappy Hallmark inspired love story crowbarred in) at the end of the day it'll still be a forgettable film.",4,3,8,12 June 2016
No Strings Attached," No Strings Attached: Another Ashton Kutcher film. That may be all you need to know.
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole Ashland'No Strings Attached' is about as good as any Ashton Kutcher movie could be. Surprisingly directed by Ivan Reitman (Up in the Air, Ghostbusters) and starring the aforementioned Ashton Kutcher (Dude, Where's My Car?, That 70s Show) and Natalie Portman (seriously, what is she doing in this movie?! She was the lead in 'Black Swan' for god sakes!) as two twenty-something's who make an arrangement , as an alternative to dating, to simply use each other for sex with, you guessed it, 'no strings attached'. And as a result, this played out premise leaves audiences with; you guessed it, 'much to be desired'. This film also costars Kevin Kline (A Fish Called Wanda, The Ice Storm) in the worst role of his career (yes, worst than 'Wild Wild West'), but I will talk more about him later in this review.Side Note: Another startling revelation about 'No Strings Attached' is that Elizabeth Meriwether (a writer whom I have been hearing was the next great female screenplay writer in Hollywood) was responsible for writing this amateurish (at best) script. Here is all you need to know. This is a romantic comedy, with very little comedy and almost no romanticism at all. Have you ever seen a romantic comedy where you don't want to two main characters to get together in the end? No? Well, this might be the first.Dear Natalie Portman, I know you probably had tons of fun making 'No Strings Attached', much more fun than the audience did watching it, but please go back to making serious dramas. This was not a good career move and you have a child to worry about now. So throw Ashton and Demi's phone number away and sign on for 'Black Swan 2' before it's too late.Signed, The dwindling number of fans you have left.Natalie Portman, is a really great actress and makes the most out of this poorly written character (one of the only reasons to see this movie), but if the movie is not very good then who cares how well she did, really. In fact many of the female performances in this movie are not bad, but the male performances from Kutcher and Kline are so whiny and pathetic (Meriwether's fault) that this film is borderline offensive to men (or anyone with eyes or ears for that matter).Back to Kevin Kline. What Kline has done here is literally taken his career out back and shot it in the head. His character is working with the most distracting dialogue; spewing non sequiturs as if the audience is supposed to think he is quirky or something when all it is, is confusing. It gets to the point where, every time he is on screen, it is literally the most awkward point in movie history.Final Thought: By this point, you know if 'No Strings Attached' is a movie for you or not. If all you need in a movie experience is to see Ashton Kutcher's butt, then by all means this is the movie for you. Again, I don't blame Kutcher for this movie, because by now it is clear that he is only capable of playing the same role over and over again.

The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," What does one dragon need with all that gold?
","To paraphrase Matt Atchity, Editor in Chief of Rotten Tomatoes, this is the second part of the cynical cash grab adaptation of 'The Hobbit', from director Peter Jackson, which continues where 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' left off, with Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) and the dwarfs walking around. But having actual action and adventure in your action/adventure movie, goes a long way. Right off the bat, this installment is leaps and bounds better than its predecessor on the sole basis that this action/adventure doesn't take nearly two hours to get going.More improvements: There are tons more intimidating and grotesque looking villains that keep this story moving forward (the giant spiders stand as one of the scariest things I've seen on the big screen, all year) even though the plot consists of a highly repetitive formula, wherein they guys walk around, run into a group of hostile enemies (who all seem to be anit-dwarfist) get captured, have to hear a slathering of anti-dwarf propaganda, believe all is lost, miraculously escape, walk around some more, run into different hostile enemies, get recaptured and start the process all over again. But it was the actual battle sequences which really made me lean forward in my seat. From the extremely well choreographed river sequence, laced with superb comedic timing and the best camera-work since The Two Towers, to the 40 minute battle with a fire breathing dragon named Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch) a dragon more impressive looking than anything in that new 'Godzilla' trailer, it's good that Jackson finally realized the likelihood of people actually enjoying this series, is predicated on its entertainment value. Back to basics.One of my biggest complaints about my 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' movie going experience, was the 48 frames per second aspect. This was an argument against the film that many critics outright and irresponsibly disregarded; as if how the film looked has nothing to do with ones movie going experience. Anyway, according to a recent article in The Guardian, Peter Jackson admits to 'softening the high definition of this newest installment' so as to make it more cinematic. And though 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' is not quite 24fps, it is obviously a much better visual experience all around, thus enabling our eyes to simply focus on the masterful direction that Jackson brings to the table, instead of being distracted by a filming technique that repeatedly takes the viewer out of the cinematic world.Final Thought: The content is still really stretched out, the film is still a bit too long (maybe 30 minutes or so) and there is some exposition that I didn't quite understand, but didn't seem relevant to this installment. BUT, with a film where (going in) I knew it would be nearly three hours long, wouldn't have a 'real' ending since there is still one more film to come and was the sequel to a film that nearly made my list of the ten worst movies of 2012, the fact that 'The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug' was mostly a non-stop thrill ride and had more of a comedic edge than any of the last four Jackson hobbit driven productions, really doesn't leave me much to complain about.",8,1,5,15 December 2013
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," 48 fps?! WHY?!!!
","If not for the action packed final hour of this film, 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' would have been more of a disappointment than it already was. Directed by none other than Peter Jackson (more about his direction to come) this prequel to The Lord of the Rings trilogy follows a young Bilbo Baggins (if you don't know who I'm talking about, then you can stop reading now) who (for some reason) is compelled to accompany a rag tag group of pot smoking Dwarf's (all with unpronounceable names) on their three movie quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erbor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. Again, if that all sounded like baby talk to you, then stop reading now, because this is not your type of movie. Furthermore, this plot does fall into the pitfall of, if you are going into this movie cold (or with no prior knowledge of J.R.R. Tolkien's novels or Jackson prior films) then your issues will be in finding a reason to care about Bilbo's journey at all, even though he is an intriguing character. Anyway, for the most part this is a watered down version of anything seen in The Lord of the Rings trilogy, but still, with Jackson's customary copious exposition and million dollar battle sequences. There is also a welcome tone of levity throughout, that while departs from the beloved source material, does push this very awkwardly slow film forward (somewhat). With all of that said, there is no, no, NO REASON that this story needs to be separating into three 3 hour films! Because isn't Tolkien's The Hobbit only like 300 pages to begin with? Side Note: By now most of you know that this film is the first in a trilogy. And if you are familiar with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, then you have a good idea of how Jackson likes to structure the endings (or non-endings) of the first two films. So, if you are not a fan of 3 hour movies with no endings (and when I say 3 hours, I really mean 2 hours and 49 minutes, but you get my point) then again, stop reading now, this movie is not for you.48 fps is not cinematic: So does the production company just let Jackson do whatever he wants now?! While the set design is amazing, the score is epic, and the story, while meandering, will satisfy fans of The Lord of the Rings series, the film looks like utter crap. In shooting 'The Hobbit' in 48 frames per second, Jackson has chosen to make everything on screen look like the behind-the-scenes portion on a Blu-ray DVD. Everything CGI looks aggressively fake, and far too lit. When characters are walking around, it is obvious that they are walking through massive sets on a sound stage. And as for the characters themselves, not since 'Battlefield Earth' has a film looked more like a bunch of actors, running around in prosthetics and hair pieces. This 48 frames technique also makes character motions look extremely sped up, to the point where I thought something was wrong with the projection for the first ten minutes. In short, filming in 48 fps repeatedly takes the viewer out of the cinematic glossiness, by continuously reminding us all that we are watching a movie with actors, on sound stages, wearing bad prosthetics. Trust me, like an old-timey BBC production, the look of 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey' is total GARBAGE. And worst of all, throughout the film you never get used to it; despite what other critics may be saying.OK, so Jackson has gone on the record to state that this type of filmmaking is the way of the future. And even though many have complained that 48 fps makes everything look as if you're on set watching the actual filming, he is fiercely unapologetic. And, while I hate to admit that he may be right in this aspect (much like the people who unfortunately proclaim that 3D is here to say) it doesn't change the fact that this 48 fps doesn't work for a movie that is so predicated on a suspension of belief that comes along with its science fiction visuals. And if you think I'm making too much of this aspect, I'm not. The picture quality here is not only distracting, but off-putting. And it's a shame because the plot itself, for what it is (despite its pacing) is enjoyable enough.There are some aspects that work here, that I haven't touched on already. There are a few cool, battle sequences with Orcs and Goblins and the performances here are all fine; the stand out being Martin Freeman, who plays the neurotic role of Bilbo Baggins better than Elijah Wood ever played Frodo Baggins. Also, I should mention that Andy Serkis as Gollum steals the show here, but it may disappoint many to know that he doesn't even show up until the final hour of the movie, for all of 30 minutes.Final Thought: Simply stated, if you are a fan of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, then there will be some thematic stuff here to enjoy (mostly near the end of the film) but otherwise don't bother with 'The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey'.Written by Markus Robinson Follow me on Twitter @moviesmarkus",4,20,45,15 December 2012
How to Train Your Dragon 2," A giant leap forward in the world of animation
","If 2010's 'How to Train Your Dragon' helped put DreamWorks Animation on the map as a legitimate contender to the Pixar throne, then 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is visually one of the most impressive animation experiences ever. Created as the first DreamWorks animated film to use the new 'Premo' and 'Torch' lighting software throughout and with the assistance of some excellent direction from Dean DeBlois, 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' is technically a visual masterpiece.Synopsis: We continue to follow the voice-cracking young Viking, Hiccup (voiced by Jay Baruchel) and his dragon Toothless as their adventurous ways lead them to stumble upon a previously undiscovered dragon sanctuary, which of course must be threatened by a dragon hating bad guy.Now, is the story as strong as the visuals? Hell no! Actually, if I had any complaint at all, it would be that that story is fairly weak right up until the end of the Act 2 where things suddenly take a dark and quite attention grabbing turn. But the plot was entertaining enough to keep my attention, which means it's more than entertaining enough to keep the attention of any child and/or fan of the first installment (neither of which describes me).Final Thought: Lack of a memorable plot notwithstanding, and aside from the fact that, in my opinion, it was a strange production choice to have a movie with such a particular plot twist open on Father's Day weekend, I GUARANTEE (judging from the lackluster Disney 'Big Hero 6' teaser trailer) 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' will win the Oscar for best animated film, based solely on its technical merits. Go ahead and quote me on that.",8,3,8,29 June 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Now on DVD
","What does award worthy cinematography, brilliant set design, milk drinking, flamboyant moustaches, impromptu poetry readings, deadpan facial expressions, characters so eccentric it hurts and weird cheek birthmarks all have in common? You guessed it! All of these aspects play a huge role in the new Wes Anderson film.I hope you're sitting down, but I wasn't crazy about 'The Grand Budapest Hotel'. Those who are familiar with my more public rants know my feelings regarding writer/director Wes Anderson: A master craftsman when it comes to visual composition, while simultaneously constructing plots and developing characters (and dialogue) which are nearly always eccentrically excessive, rambling and fashionably nihilistic, in the most annoying way possible. That said, upon entering the theater, I did manage to do my duty as a critic and put all past feelings aside.Synopsis: Beginning with a sequence which was described by a critic much smarter than myself as a 'hipster inception', 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' tells the story of a concierge (Ralph Fiennes) annoyingly and constantly referred to as Gustave H., who heads up (you guessed it) The Grand Budapest Hotel and has a fetish for having sex with the elderly. Zero is a lobby boy, annoyingly and constantly referred to as 'lobby boy' or 'my lobby boy'. The two, for some reason, become friends just in time for Gustave H. to be accused of the murder of one of his many friends with benefits.With a director whose films should always be up for Oscar consideration in every 'visual' category, there is a lot here which is atheistically pleasing. And if you can get into the type of high brow (or pretentious) humor Anderson is throwing at you, then the 2nd Act is full of funny gags and clever lines of dialogue; some of the funniest situational dialogue Anderson has written since 'Rushmore'.Final Thought: I have a feeling that the people who found this movie hilarious, will point to the ever-winking, 'aren't I clever' diction, which goes hand in hand with the classic Anderson motif of proper people acting silly, as some sort of defense of their proclamation that 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' is one of the best films of the year. And to be fair, unlike 'The Royal Tenenbaums', this is a film which contains a halfway interesting plot (inspired by the writings of Austrian novelist Stefan Zweig). But meanwhile (in reality) this movie is way too eccentric for anyone who doesn't already worship at Anderson's feet. And in the end, the 3rd Act dwindles into nothing, so what's the point, really?",4,3,7,27 June 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," How did I enjoy this movie so much?!
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole Ashland I should be highlyembarrassed, being the self-proclaimed well respected critic that I am,to say this, but not only did I enjoy 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' but in this reviewers opinion, it is the best action film I have seen in years! Masterfully directed by Brad Bird (The Incredibles, Ratatouille) and starring Tom Cruise (Jerry Maguire, Top Gun), showing that he isn't quite irrelevant yet, Jeremy Renner (The Hurt Locker),delivering a great supporting performance as always, Simon Pegg (Shaun of the Dead), who brings in some much needed hilarity and Paula Patton (Jumping the Broom), who adds nothing to the movie, 'Ghost Protocol' is the fourth and clearly the best film in what had been an average action-adventure series. Beginning with one of the most stylized prison-break sequences since 'The Great Escape', this installment continues to follow the secret agent adventures of Ethan Hunt (Cruise) as his organization, the IMF, is shut down after a compromised mission in Russia results in the unit being accused of bombing the Kremlin. This leads to an accidental declaration of war by the United States, as the 'disbanded' IMF must find out who really bombed the Kremlin and blah blah blah. Like the others in the series , this plot may seem overly complex and filled with convoluted double and triple agent story lines, but WHO CARES because the film itself is everything an action film should be; entertaining and filled with a plethora of the most amazing and suspenseful stunts. You want to see a high motored car chase through the streets of Dubai, during a sandstorm? You want to see the sultry female agent seduce the bad guy then kick his butt and saving the say, all while wearing high heels? You want to see Tom Cruise literally leap tall buildings in a single bound (well, that is not how it really goes down but anyways)? Well, it's all here! That is not to say that there isn't a valid storyline here. It's more like the action sequences are so good, that the plot seemed to be only a distracting devise to transition from one action sequence to another. And I loved every minute of it.Aside from the much expected and well thought out action sequences which are customary in a film like this, there are also some very welcome supporting characters that create an atmosphere of levity (Pegg) that isn't seen in its predecessors and a cool factor (aka the Renner factor) that almost single handedly rejuvenates an action series that had become somewhat predictable and uninteresting. Pegg is hilarious here, and may be the biggest reason to see this movie, every so often giving the audience a break from the serious 'straight-man' domineer of Cruise's character. As for Renner, he is very well cast as an almost Cruise-like understudy, showing that while his potential for Award winning acting is abundant, he is multi-faceted enough to play a very polarizing action hero as well.Cruise's leading man career, after a series of unfortunate events in conjunction with a serious of unfortunate movies, was thought to be over after it was discovered that he was an actual brash eccentric and not just playing one in the movies. For the longest time it was thought to be that the only films he could get were embarrassing cameo roles (Tropic Thunder), leads in awful films (Knight and Day, Valkyrie) and L. Ron Hubbard Productions. And while the fourth installment of an action series like 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' isn't the set up for a monumental resurgence in his career, (for the few who go see this movie) it should make it clear that Cruise still has that indescribable 'it-factor' that carried him through his blockbuster film career.Final Thought: At the end of the day, this movie is simply a stylized cartoonish espiongage film, whose only true merits lay in how extremely well it works on an incredibly high entertainment level (which is far from a bad thing). And even with a film like 'Ratatouille' on his resume, it is in my opinion that Bird has crafted his best work here and even with the unavoidable sappy ending, 'Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol' stands as one of the only B-style movies which is well worth the ticket price. This is one Hollywood movie that is sure to exceed any reluctant viewer's expectations, garnering immensely more positive reviews than a backhanded compliment such as 'it's not as bad as you thought'.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Foxcatcher," Ornithologist, Philatelist, Philanthropist
","When you have a movie based on a true story, where the producer is one of the characters in said movie (in this case, Mark Schultz) then one must be cognizant of fact that the contents of the film may be skewed in a way so as to not upset the producer's credibility. That said, with the help of some momentarily interesting (but highly flawed) filmmaking from director Bennett Miller (Moneyball) 'Foxcatcher' does go places that I didn't think it would go; to the tune of some very obvious sequences of homoerotic innuendo.Synopsis: This is the story of Olympic gold medalist, Mark Schultz (Channing Tatum) a man who constantly lived in the shadow of his older brother David (Mark Ruffalo). In the mid 80's, Mark gets a call from a representative of John du Pont (Steve Carell) an unstable but extremely wealthy man; who touts himself as a bird watcher, patriot and leader of men. Du Pont initially recruits Mark to head up his wrestling team he has prestigiously dubbed Team Foxcatcher. But as du Pont takes Mark under his wing, he forces himself into the role of father figure (a role previously held by David) and then some weird stuff happens, resulting in sequences where Channing Tatum is doing drugs and sporting frosted tips. OK, so while this is a watchable character study, it's not much more than that. Even with its ending, which is highly eventful but so jarring that, for some, it may seem to come out of nowhere, 'Foxcatcher' meanders around for a majority of its 134 minute runtime, likely losing most of its audiences along the way.The biggest issue with 'Foxcatcher' is most definitely the pacing. Olympic wrestling is an odd sport to watch on film if you don't know what is specifically going on. Before going into 'Foxcatcher' I'd questioned how Miller was going to film events pertaining to the sport itself in a way that would come across as entertaining to all audiences. But then again, some critics used to think the same about filming boxing, since (aside from momentary flurries) boxing would seem like a fairly uneventful sport to film. But since the 70's with movies like 'Rocky' and 'Raging Bull', it has become obvious that boxing can be shot in a way that is highly theatrical. As for 'Foxcatcher', Miller seems unable to solve the problem of translating Olympic wrestling into something theatrically entertaining. Thus, every wrestling match shown hangs there, lifeless, especially if you have no clue how matches are scored or how one wins and loses. This flaw is clearly on Miller and his bland technique of filming these sequences. Also, it doesn't help that about 1/3 of this movie is wrestling matches and training sessions, which I suspect will put some to sleep. The second part of this pacing problem lies with the decision not to add a musical score. Yes, at times, near the end, there is a score. But most of this film is filled with silence and the sound of wrestling shoes on mats. Now, I can see what Miller was going for (with a lack of music brings on feelings of solitude, which represent how Mark Schultz is feeling during most of this movie). But this experiment comes across as awkward at best.The acting is one of this film's only 'bright spots', so let's focus on that for a moment. Tatum and Ruffalo do some of their best dramatic work here, as visually they become these characters; down to the wrestler mannerisms; the way they carry themselves and simply walk around. As for Carell, his performance will be the one everybody focuses on, since he plays a character so far removed from the slap-stick realm, with more prosthetics on than a Lord of the Rings character. And while he does do an excellent job portraying du Pont, would I say, give him the Oscar right now? No. Maybe the most complimentary thing I could say about his performance was that at many times I forgot it was Carell under all of the makeup; which may predictably be the reason he wins the Oscar this awards season.Final Thought: As wrestling is more of a psychological sport than a physical one (even though it may appear otherwise) so is this movie. That is to say, though there is not a lot of action, there is clear and continuous psychological conflict between the three main characters within 'Foxcatcher', which is an interesting take away. This and the acting are things which will garner this film attention from the award givers. But as a whole, does this film resemble anything entertaining or memorable? The answer is, absolutely not.",6,2,8,10 December 2014
Gone Girl," Gone Girl: Men Are So Dumb
","'Gone Girl' centers around a woman (Rosamund Pike) who goes missing (presumably murdered) and the media coverage which ensues and rapidly turns the husband (Ben Affleck) into the prime suspect. As this film moves forward, there are other characters which help accentuate the mystery aspect of this 'murder mystery'; e.g. Desi (Neil Patrick Harris) a past lover, Margo (Carrie Coon) the husband's sister and only confidant, and Tanner Bolt (confidently played by Tyler Perry) a charismatic Johnnie Cochran-type who loves to win as much as he loves the pageantry of defending high profile clients. Though the storytelling is continuously strong, the first half of this film is constructed in a way that due to the actual source material (which was adapted for the big screen by Gillian Flynn, from her own novel) and a heavy slathering of director David Fincher's powerfully distinctive visual sensibility, this is a film that will intentionally fool people into thinking it to be a stylized but somewhat routine murder mystery, when in actuality, what 'Gone Girl' turns into is more so a uniquely inventive, satirical, tale of fatal attraction.This 'turn' takes place about half way through, when a major plot twist occurs. A twist which separates this film from the routine and (aside from the morbid slather of dark comedy perfectly incorporated into a film about murder) puts 'Gone Girl' into a genre all its own. Not to say that other aspects of 'Gone Girl' aren't up to par. The fact is, most of the performances are engaging (if you know me, then you know I hate to admit that Tyler Perry was a part of anything worth watching) especially the work of one Rosamund Pike, who delivers a performance so visceral that it should elicit a vocal response from audiences. But all of that is overshadowed by the fascinating marital motivation concepts thrown at the audience (especially in the final scene) Fincher's direction, some excellent editing and another haunting score from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Final Thought: Though 'Gone Girl' is still receiving mostly positive critical reviews, I believe this to be a film that due to its unconventional comedic tone and twist, Fincher's adaptation of this odd little novel may not be truly appreciated as a masterwork until years down the line. Hell, with a 4 out of 5 Star review, I know that I don't truly appreciate the structural and satirical brilliance of a movie like 'Gone Girl' as much as I should or eventually will.",8,2,10,20 October 2014
Django Unchained," Take that Spike Lee!
","When a horse gets shot in the head in the first 5 minutes, this should instantaneously remind every audience member that they are watching writer/director Quentin Tarantino's latest revenge flick, 'Django Unchained'. But this isn't just a revenge story, it's also a moving love story as well. Starring Jamie Foxx as Django, a slave in the Deep South who is forcibly recruited by a German bounty hunter, Dr. Schultz, played by Christoph Waltz, who promises to give Django his freedom following the capture three Overseers turned outlaws. But when Schultz finds out that Django's true quest in life is to reunite with his long lost wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) as they had been separated by slave trade, he takes it upon himself to help Django on his journey; a journey which leads them to Candy Land, the plantation owned by one Calvin Candie, fabulously played by Leonardo DiCaprio in an award worthy performance.As in his other films, brilliantly constructed dialogue, shock value violence, with a mixture of campy satire and beautiful aesthetics fuel this story. But undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of 'Django Unchained' is how ballsy of a subject matter this is, for a director who has (in the past) been accused of using the 'N' word so flippantly. And as if Tarantino was very aware of this fact, not long into the film it becomes quite obvious that 'Django Unchained' will not only stand as the newest film from the #1 film geek turned director himself, but also as a well formatted rebuttal (middle finger) to all of his 'haters'.This is truly the Tarantino Western in every facet, with great shoot-out sequences, wonderfully Clint Eastwood-esque dialogue and characters that are all larger than life. Hell, he even formats a satirical KKK comedy bit that is as funny as anything in Mel Brooks' Blazing Saddles'. But it's not until this film hits the scenes within Candy Land in Act 2, does 'Django Unchained' work as 100% entertainment (but this doesn't happen until about an hour in). That said, the first hour of this movie takes a while to develop (much like the old 60's westerns) Tarantino's refusal to outsource his score does tonally hinder the film a bit and the third act carries on about fifteen minutes longer than is necessary. So, while that doesn't change the fact that the second act of this movie (the central hour) is damn near perfect, it also means 'Django Unchained' doesn't reach its full potential as an overall film; to the point where this may be seen as a slightly underdeveloped failure by some Tarantino fans expecting every one of his films to be 'Pulp Fiction'.The Acting: Aside from a cameo by Don Johnson playing a plantation owner named Big Daddy, which is clearly the cameo of the year, and both Waltz (who should only be in Tarantino films from now on) and Foxx doing fine enough work here, the real stars of the show are Samuel L. Jackson, who plays the hilariously evil old house slave (the Uncle Tom) in Candy Land and DiCaprio, who is the best part of this movie by far, giving his depiction of a flamboyantly evil Plantation owner. DiCaprio is astounding to watch here, not only chewing the scenery but eating it alive, giving a performance which is so despicably engaging, that it's sure to live on in cinematic villain history.Side Note: There should be no complaints about Tarantino's depictions of African American's in 'Django Unchained' simply because while he does maintain his trademark pulpy violent, dark comedy style throughout, at many times he does push the boundaries, more than ever before, with a dramatic and fairly historically accurate portrayal of the South during slavery. In fact, the main thing that separates 'Django Unchained' from his other films is this added dose of reality, which is sure to make audiences uncomfortable; and rightfully so, as this is a movie about slavery. Make no butts about it, some of this film is very hard to watch (in the same vein as something like 'Amistad' would be). And while these serious visual choices that Tarantino makes may come off as tonally strong, it all works because of how historically necessary they are to the story. Another difference here is how this may be the first Tarantino film where audiences are made to feel an overwhelming sense of sorrow for the main character's plight. But also make note that Django is not depicted as a 'poor me' black man (i.e. like the Michael Oher character in 'The Blindside') but as the self empowered hero; a black character that is rarely seen in these types of films. So (in my opinion) 'Django Unchained' not only pays homage to the 1966 Spaghetti Western 'Django' (riddled with sudden zooms and extreme closes ups on squinting eyes) but also works as an homage to black history.Final Thought: While the story itself isn't as creative as 'Inglorious Basterds' and it's not a movie Spike Lee will be watching any time soon, 'Django Unchained' is clearly a better movie than anything Lee has put out in a long time and is definitely worth checking.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

22 Jump Street," The Rise of Vietnamese Jesus
","With a premise surrounding the reoccurring, self-aware joke, 'do the same thing as last time and people will be happy', '22 Jump Street' takes the attractive yet dumb cop (Channing Tatum) and comically weird looking but smart cop (Jonah Hill) and moves them from 21 Jump St. across the street to 22 Jump St.; a new building which is acknowledged (in a very tongue-in-cheek manner) as having a much more expensive look for absolutely no reason. This time their assignment takes them undercover, masquerading as college students, in order to discover the distributor of a new synthetic drug. Basically and purposefully the same premise as the last movie (only this time in college). Sounds hilarious, right? With expectations high, partly because of the creative minds behind it (directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller) partly because of the early critical response (some calling it, 'The funniest sequel ever') and partly because 2012's '21 Jump Street' was a box-office success, I admittedly went into my screening ready to laugh. And though the chemistry between Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum still worked, the satirical nature throughout was still pretty smart and well written (as the film pokes fun at big-budget Hollywood sequels, the college experience and split screens) and Ice Cube is given more to do (which is always good) there are a few glaring problems which caused this comedy to be far more flawed than it should have been: 1. Most of the funny parts are in trailers. Even though this is the fault of the marketing team and not the film itself, nobody enjoys paying exorbitant ticket prices to sit through a movie containing jokes they could see for free on TV.2. It's not as funny as '21 Jump Street'. In the case of movies that are either sequels or hold strong resemblances to other (usually more infamous) films, I try my hardest not to let comparisons influence my final rating. It is my intent to review each film on its own individual merits. But here's the thing: In the case of '22 Jump Street', the filmmakers have purposefully designed the jokes in such a way as to almost demand that audiences compare this movie to its predecessor as often as possible. It is in this rare case that my rating must reflect as such. Therefore, '22 Jump Street', while funny at times, wasn't nearly funny enough to meet (let alone, exceed) expectations set by '21 Jump Street'.Side Note: And I didn't even mention the unfortunate Maya Angelou and Tracy Morgan jokes, which instantly silenced a crowd that was intent on laughing over every other punch-line.Final Thought: Yes, directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (The Lego Movie, Cloudy with a Change of Meatballs, 21 Jump Street) deserve the title as two of the hottest comedy directors working, but this is a bit of a misstep in their assent to the top of the genre, simple because it isn't as funny or clever as what we've come to expect from the duo. Luckily, Jonah Hill does save the day more than a few times, as his performance may be the only true standout of this entire film (which is hardly a surprise). He seemed to lead by example, taking firm control of nearly every funny bit with his unique style of physical, self-deprecating and quick witted comedy. Plus, unlike Kevin Hart, Hill can play the same comedic character over and over again and it has yet to become played out or obnoxious. Sothere's that.",6,4,10,15 June 2014
Brave," Go Feminism!
","Thank God 'Brave' isn't as historically serious (and/or boring) as the trailers made it out to be. Directed by Brenda Chapman, who was then fired and replaced by Mark Andrews (probably for the better) 'Brave' is the much anticipated new animated feature film from the geniuses at Pixar centered around the story of a young Scottish princess. With mind-blowing animation and a simplistic but highly entertaining storyline, after the whole 'Cars 2' fiasco, 'Brave' will undoubtedly spell a return to form for the Lebron James of animation that is Pixar Studios. And when I say mind-blowing animation, the hair speaks for itself.With a storyline that should not be solely considered non-abrasive cartoon feminism at its best, but a touching mother/daughter tale as well, 'Brave' tells the story of Princess Merida, a Scottish princess with fiery red hair, who is skilled in archery, horseback riding and stubbornness. When her mother informs her that there is to be a competition taking place where young men from neighboring families will fight for Merida's hand in marriage, this progressive adolescent princess will have none of it. Determined to thwart her mother's wishes, Princess Merida sets out into the enchanted woods to find the one 'magical thing' (that's what you call foreshadowing) which will make her mother change her mind and in turn change Merida's own fate. Yes, this type of heroine may draw comparisons to Disney princesses of the past, but with a more tomboyish adventurous spirit (rivaling a female action character such as 'Mulan').With a super simplistic storyline, in comparison to other Pixar films, 'Brave' is front loaded with very welcome and marvelously constructed slapstick comedy and very colorful supporting characters which makes up for a second half slump. But before I get to the issues pertaining to the almost irrational plot twist the second half of the film takes, allow me to praise the work in the first half. From the characters, especially Merida and her three toddler aged brothers, who steal the show, providing audiences with a multitude of laugh out loud moments (seriously, they are as rambunctiously endearing as the fat kid from 'Up') to the slapstick driven storyline of the three hilariously awkward suitors, the first 45 minutes of 'Brave' are almost perfect. It is when other, more fantastical characters, whose magical circumstances are not very well thought out, arise in the latter half of the film that the movies as a whole takes a bit of a nosedive; that is to say many audiences (young and old) will be finding themselves waiting for the next laugh. With that said, the first half is so strong, that the latter, more eventful but far less engaging, half can be forgiven and even forgotten.Final Thought: Again, when compared to other Pixar gems, excluding the snoozer that was 'Cars 2' (boy, I hated that movie) 'Brave' doesn't really stand out (primarily for lack of storyline complexity). But on its own merits 'Brave' is not only a film worth paying 10+ dollars to see, but is sure to be a front runner for Best Animated Feature Film come Oscar season. Plus, this is Disney's second attempt in only a short while (I am referring to 'The Princess and the Frog') at playing the culturally aware card, by using the Scottish born voice-work of Kelly MacDonald, Billy Connolly and Emma Thompson...and that should count for something if you look at Disney's culturally insensitive past.",7,0,3,12 July 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Where does Star-Lord get batteries for his Walkman?
","Yup, I think writer/director James Gunn has done enough to make everyone forget about Joss Whedon. Bringing forth his big screen adaptation of an obscure team of Marvel superheroes called the Guardians of the Galaxy, Gunn's sense of humor and strong grasp of what made so many of the action/adventure films of the 70's and 80's so memorable, has single-handedly created another profitable layer to the Marvel film franchise.This origins story follows our main protagonist Peter 'my friends call me Star-Lord' Quill (Chris Pratt) as he creates an unlikely alliance with a band of intergalactic misfits, including Gamora (a green Zoe Saldana) Rocket (a raccoon voiced by Bradley Cooper) his sidekick Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel?) and Drax the Destroyer (played by Bautista, of WWE fame) who is basically Sheldon after a year of Crossfit, as they attempt to stop the evil Ronan the Accuser from obtaining an orb that could destroy an entire species in one fell swoop. Needless to say, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' shares a lot of similarities with Star Warswell, if the original Star Wars trilogy had focused on the life and times of Han Solo instead of boring old Luke Skywalker.When critics say Gunn is breaking the Marvel mold with this movie, I don't know that that's altogether true. Yes, this is the first (if I'm not mistaken) Marvel film that has little to do with Earth. And yes, it does have a strong comedic element, but so has every other Marvel film since the Disney takeover. What Gunn does do that is quite innovative, is strategically positions the strong comedic element as the star of the show, which along with the cast and an awesome late 60's/early 70's mixtape inspired soundtrack, creates a fun atmosphere first and foremost; even though he's working with a story and characters which may lack the depth of most other heroes in the Marvel universe. He is also responsible for casting Vin Diesel in the first role worthy of his limited acting abilities. With that move alone, I must give Mr. Gunn mad props. Here's to hoping that Diesel is regulated to one or two lines of dialogue in every movie he does moving forward.Chris Pratt: I think we all knew that Chris Pratt was leading man material. 'Guardians of the Galaxy' just works to enforce this notion. Pratt, an actor who can seamlessly move back and forth between genres, is more than half of the reason why this comic book movie will be entertaining enough to satisfy your average Marvel movie-goer, while finding an audience with those who would otherwise steer clear of anything 'comic book', as he gives both a dramatic and comedic performance as the protagonist Peter Quill (an endearingly overconfident character who maintains an underdog fueled moxie, which stems from his 1980's American upbringing) that is worth the price of admission.Final Thought: 'Guardians of the Galaxy' has pretty much everything one could ask for in a superhero movie: An engaging lead, fully developed supporting sub-heroes, a badass villain, comedy, well choreographed action sequences and a raccoon that shoots machine guns. That said, is 'Guardians of the Galaxy' the best Marvel adaptation ever made? No. But is it the funniest? Most definitely.",8,2,4,5 August 2014
Evil Dead," Where's Bruce Campbell when you need him?
","This is essentially the 1981 original with most of the fun elements pumped out of it. OK, so to be fair 'Evil Dead' is definitely more of a reboot than a remake. Other than the name, director Fede Alvarez and co-writer Diablo Cody have tweaked 'The Evil Dead' story just enough (while keeping its original cabin in the woods mold) that this 'Evil Dead' should be considered a standalone piece from the Sam Raimi series. That said, with a plot line consisting of five friends spending the night together in a cabin in the woods and reading from a Book of the Dead until they are one by one possessed by demons, leaving only one left to fight for survival, it is hard not compare it to the original. It is just such a shame that the original is so much better than this unimpressive attempt at horror. In short, the Alvarez/Cody 'changes' I alluded to above, only work to overexpose a perfectly simplistic storyline, making the movie seem longer than need be and also nearly destroying the campy nature of what made the original 'The Evil Dead' such a success.That is not to say that the second half of the film doesn't contain parts which some would consider 'fun'. There are a few well directed creepy visuals and the grotesque makeup here is simply superb (the best part of the movie). Furthermore, and quite shockingly, this reboot is not just another mindless big budget torture-porn gorefest, like 2003's 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'well, let me reword that. In the spirit of 'The Evil Dead' franchise, which is essentially predicated on violence and campy gore, this reboot isn't as maliciously gory as advertized, but still earns its R rating.That said, almost all campy moments in the second half are clearly examples of too little too late, as nothing remotely funny (or interesting) happens until almost an hour in. There are also some nice callbacks to the original, including the infamous POV shots where the camera barrels through the woods, chasing after a screaming woman. But in the same breath I should make mention that the tree rape scene from the original is totally ruined here. I know what you're saying. How does someone screw up a tree raping scene?! And yet Critics of this critique may say that I went into this film with many biases, being that I am such a fan of the original. But to those I would say: I strongly believe that even the people who enjoyed 'Evil Dead' (for what it is) or God forbid, haven't seen the original, will still surely forget about it by the time the next Paranormal Activity comes out. In fact, if not for a rather suspenseful final 10 minutes, which may be the bloodiest in recent years, this movie would have been completely forgettable.Side Note: The trailers are more memorable than anything in this film. Oh, and by the way, you know the part in the trailer when the 'possessed girl' utters the infamous line 'we're going to get you, not another peep, time to go to sleep'? Yeah, that's not in this film.The Acting: I won't mention anything about the acting, only because the acting in a movie like this isn't important AT ALL! Final Thought: Even though 'Evil Dead' does spark from time to time, it can't seem to ignite or let alone sustain any sort of suspenseful, campy or terrifying atmosphere. From its far too serious for its own good tone, to an exposition that is way too drawn out (especially for fans of the original) to its failed attempts to go the 'Drag Me to Hell' (make situations and visuals so over-the-top that they are intentionally humorous) route, as a whole, this film should be considered a watchable disappointment. I will go so far as to say that 'Evil Dead' was so shrug inducing that it is no wonder why Sam Raimi gave it his seal of approval, as he must have seen this reboot as no threat to overshadow his original classic.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Prisoners," Taken 3
","Filled with a barrage of visual symbolism and plenty of poetic justice (especially during the final shot) 'Prisoners' would have undoubtedly made a better novel than movie. That said, it wasn't the surprisingly superb and layered Aaron Guzikowski (Contraband) script that I had a problem with (well, there was one scene concerning a certain character walking his dog that was a little too absurd, but) it's the surprisingly average direction from Denis Villeneuve (Incendies) which had me proclaiming: 'If only this had been directed by the Cohen Brothers!' Synopsis: On an aggressively rainy night, six-year-old Anna Dover and her friend Joy go missing; presumably abducted. After this initial event, 'Prisoners' forks off into two separate yet competing (and many times, interacting) story lines. In one, Jackman's character, Keller Dover (father of Anna) seeks vengeance on who he suspects to be the abductor, a mentally challenged man named Alex, who looks like the portrait of a child molester, and played by Paul Dano, in a role which seemed to be tailor-made for him (I don't know if that's a good or bad thing). The second storyline sees the tattooed Detective Loki (played by Jake Gyllenhaal) as the lead investigator on the case, attempting to find the missing girls before it's too late.The Acting: While I was more than a little disappointed that Dano's character was all but completely forgotten about during the second half of this movie, the star studded cast, which consists of Viola Davis, Maria Bello, Terrence Howard, Melissa Leo, the aforementioned Jackman (who is just 'all right' here. I mean, he has one scene where he goes all Wolverine on someone, but) and Dano all come through with decent to noteworthy performances. But the real star of the show is Gyllenhaal, who unquestionably has played some troubled and complex characters in his career and Detective Loki may be the most intriguing of them all. And it doesn't hurt that he gives an Oscar nomination worthy performance (oddly the only one in this movie).Final Thought: For 3/4th of this film, 'Prisoners' is nothing less than a 'worth the price of admission' thriller, entirely motivated by characters who are all interacting along the blurred lines of good and evil, in a story which basically depicts the age old outline of the Devil and God waging war over the souls of the innocent; in the same vein as 1995's 'Se7en'. However, the final 40 minutes is where 'Prisoners' did lose me a little, as it meanders, taking twists and semi-confusing turns that may cause some viewers to check their watches rather than stay glued to their seats. That doesn't mean 'Prisoners' isn't one worth checking out (just don't see it at AMC Mercado) as it is a film which will stay with you for hours after you've left the theater (in a good way) as it continuously begs the question: what lengths would you go to see that your child is safe?

The Artist," Can a silent film really win Best Picture?
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Thank God for new ideas! With aspects of sound films such as 'Singing in the Rain' and 'Citizen Kane', as well as almost every silent film I ever saw in film school, 'The Artist' is a silent film inexplicably released in 2011; and a modern masterpiece to boot. Without audible dialogue director Michel Hazanavivius creates a visual feast for the senses, merging his vision with a stellar soundtrack, which navigates the viewer through a whirlwind of emotions, just as a more conventional/modern sound-film would. 'The Artist' tells the very intriguing story of George Valentin, played by Jean Dajardin, an actor with the charisma of a Rudolph Valentino, but with an attitude that rivals Chaplin. In 1927 Valentin stands as the biggest star of the Hollywood silent era, making countless films with his sidekick, a happy-go-lucky dog. But with the emergence of the talkie (the talking picture), and many younger actors, specifically a young actress named Peppy Miller, played by Berenice Bejo, Valentin fears that he will not be able to (and frankly doesn't want to) make the transition into a future dominated by sound films. Hazanvivius has constructed a very entertaining as well as historically accurate storyline, all while paying homage to the groundbreaking era in which this story takes place. Using old fashioned wipes and cuts, he allows the audiences (even some who haven't seen silent films) to experience a slice of film history (the silent era) as it should be experienced; in a more or less silent format. And in this day and age, where the Hollywood formula seems to be either an abundance of explosions, which destroy the senses and/or sexually irresponsible teenagers being moralistically decapitated, 'The Artist' demonstrates a refreshing acknowledgement of how movies can be fun again with some simple yet visually breathtaking storytelling. This is very much cinema at its richest. What can I say? 'The Artist' made me smile.'The Artist' is a silent film about silent films; that is not entirely silent. BUT how these rare introductions of sound are interwoven into the story demonstrates a real stroke of genius from Hazanavivius. In fact, there are many broad strokes of genius at play during 'The Artist', from the director's intricate attention to detail, in terms of the striking look of his cinematic vision, to the actors who all give performances of a lifetime. Everybody is perfectly cast (yes, even John Goodman, who is only in the movie for a short period). In fact, it would be very difficult find better lead actors in 2011 than Dujardin, who is polarizing as the once prolific Valentin, and Bejo who is phenomenal as the strong rising star/love interest Peppy Miller. Both show off their strong acting skills as they play necessarily overdramatized and flawed characters, without resorting to campiness. Furthermore, if there was a best supporting animal performance, the dog in 'The Artist' would be sure to win. And if the dog is worthy of an award, shouldn't that be the truest sign of a great ensemble cast? Final Thought: Please don't disregard 'The Artist' just because you heard that it is a silent film. This film breaks down every generational or genre barrier known to man. This is a comedy with genuine laughs, a tragedy with genuine tears and a drama that is a monumental achievement in modem cinema. I don't get to say this much, in a year filled with failed Adam Sandler productions, but this film is damn near flawless. And while 'The Artist' may not be my favorite film of the year, it is damn near close, and would not surprise me if it won for Best Picture at the Oscars, as well as best director and best lead actor. Did I just say that?! But need I say more? Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review. The more hits I get the better. Thank you.",10,1,1,24 December 2011
Mama," The Caucasian La Llorona
","Remember when you were young and your mom told you that if you didn't treat her well, then she would come back and haunt you from beyond the grave?...No?...Really?! Uhhh, wellÂ…directed by Andres Muschietti (NOT GUILLERMO DEL TORO) 'Mama' is the newest January horror release attempting to not massively disappoint a wide array of critics. And while (as far as new age horror films go) I thought 'Mama' was for the most part pretty effective and will be giving this movie a recommendation, I am also recommending that (for the most enjoyable experience) one walk out of this movie around 15 minutes before the final credits roll, when this film completely falls apart. There is a storyline here concerning two creepy little girls who are found seemingly alone in the woods (but in fact are being watched over by a jealous ghost named Mama) and are taken in by their estranged uncle and his hard rock, tattooed girlfriend (played by Jessica Chastain) but truthfully the more you pay attention to the quite sappy and overcomplicated plot, the more distracted (much like in last year's 'The Woman in Black') you will be from the real star of 'Mama', the scares themselves. In fact the parts that don't work here are the awkwardly clunky exposition and (as I alluded to before) the final 15 minutes when 'Mama' becomes once again back-story motivated, with an inexplicably nonsensical and Disney-esque 'the ghost must learn her lesson too' ending. And nobody wants to see that. In fact, most of the time the scariest things about some of the great horror movie monsters stem from their unexplained motives; a la, the less we (the audience) knows about the monster, other than it wants to kill and deliver scares, the scarier the movie becomes. Therefore, the back-story behind Mama being a sort of Caucasian version of 'La Llorona' would have worked immensely well on scares alone, if not for a need by these filmmakers (Muschietti and writer Neil Cross) to give an overly dramatic character explanation, humanizing the monster and taking all of the wind out of Mama's sails. What does work in this movie's favor are the horror genre visuals which make up a large portion of the middle chunk of this film. OK, so while some of the scares may seem cheap, the Mama 'monster' is pretty damn scary. Furthermore, what initially may seem like cheap scares, quickly turn into cheap yet effective scares throughout (clearly exceeding the classic 6 scare rule). There are even a few rather well constructed horror genre directorial choices that while won't be classified as scares, will be seen as rather creepy moments. As for Chastain playing the rocker chick/girlfriend/adopted mother in all of this (with her Misfit's t-shirt, black nail polish and her many, many bracelets) she gives a performance that while isn't a cinematic nose dive (the likes of Natalie Portman going from 'Black Swan' to 'Your Highness') it is one that can only be described as pretty much that of zero substance. Which is to say, she's not bad, nor is she good; she is more so wasted in a rocker chick role which will undoubtedly be forgotten in the years to come.Final Thought: All in all, if you are looking to see a horror (or date) movie that does deliver in the visual scares department and are willing to ignore the annoyingly distracting storyline, then 'Mama' may be the movie for you. But if I said it once, I'll say it a million times, if you choose not to walk out of this movie 15 minutes before it's over, then don't come crying to me. I warned you.

Sinister," Film vs. Digital
","In this sort of anti-found footage film from director Scott Derrickson, 'Sinister', a movie I would refer to as more of a thriller than an actual horror because of the limited genre based scares it contains, surprisingly does contain such a high level of suspense throughout its eerie premise, that in the end, even though it does have one major flaw, it turns out to be the scariest movie of the year so far (by far).The Plot: 'The Shinning' inspired premise involves a writer of true crime novels by the name of Ellison Oswalt (played by Ethan Hawke) who, in order to gather information for his new book, moves his wife and two children into a house where a family was brutally murdered; without his families prior knowledge of course. You see, it's been ten years since Ellison's last big hit and with his financial situation and marriage both on the rocks, this plot point is seen as his final desperate attempt to write a lucrative novel. While moving in, he finds a series of Super 8 films, he suspects to be home movies, in the attic, and begins watching them as part of his investigation. What he soon discovers is that these films not only document the murder of the family whose house he now resides in, but also the grisly murders (each more gruesome than the last) of three more unknown families. As the days continue, he proceeds to watch each of these films, looking for clues. But what he finds is much more alarming, when during one viewing he discovers that a man (or monster) has been standing in the background of each one of the films, the entire time. Why this thriller for the most part works so well is quite simple. First of all, Derrickson's direction, aside from a few inevitable hiccups (which I will touch on later) creates an undeniably suspenseful atmosphere, which slowly escalates throughout the entire film. I don't know about you, but that is exactly what I want out of a good horror flick. And aside from the obvious visuals of the all too disturbing killings, Derrickson's use of hand held camera movement and a good amount of visually haunting shots elevates what could have been a true disaster of a film, into one that is a mixture of an intriguing psychological thriller and spooky campfire tale. And if you think I'm giving Derrickson too high of visual praise here, I will end with this: 'Sinister' is not only the most beautifully shot horror film in recent years, but also makes a compelling case for a best director nomination (which will never happen).The second reason 'Sinister' works so well lies in how high the screenplay writer (in this case Scott Derrickson) has upped the hero's stakes. Aside from a movie visually not being scary enough, distractingly obnoxious or unlikeable characters are usually the downfalls of any horror film. For example: Every movie in the 'Saw' and 'Hostel' franchise, or a movie where you are rooting for the deformed bad-guy to chop up the beautiful teenagers. That's why I believe that the protagonists motive in 'Sinister', a struggling artist who will stop at nothing to boost his career (much like Ethan Hawke) is so believable/compelling, as well as contains a fair amount of pathos, that any plot holes, over-the-top supernatural visuals or accounts of bad acting will most likely be immediately forgiven, if not outright ignored by a larger majority of theater going audiences.As I had made mention to prior, 'Sinister' is unfortunately held back from being a great horror because of one major flaw. A flaw I'd like to refer to as 'the child-element.' This is the case with many horror films, when the story revolves around children or in the case of 'Sinister' children play an intricate role in the reveal, the entire movie has the strong potential of visually becoming quite goofy. There are two instances which implement, for lack of a better phrase, ghost children. These two sequences are undeniably silly and in turn are too great to be ignored, instantly taking the viewer out of the film experience. Now, that is not to say that because the story is so good that one of these scenes can't be quickly forgotten. It's just a shame that the other sequence in question makes up (semi-spoiler alert) the final 3 minutes of the film, absolutely ruining Sinister's ending. In short, for 80 or so minutes this is a damn near perfect thriller, but in the latter half, when this film focuses more and more on the man/monster, the movie itself becomes more susceptible to the visually laughable/supernatural ghost children moments in question.",8,0,1,12 November 2012
Beauty and the Beast," Save some money. Watch the animated version.
","Call me a poor sport or a fun killer or someone who takes movies too seriously or even a film critic, but as a movie-goer I found this live-action remake to be completely unnecessary and all together forgettable, just like that 2015 live-action Disney adaption of Cinderella. Remember that one?...I didn't think so. Synopsis: This 'tale as old as time' (adapted from Disney's 1991 animated Beauty and the Beast) once again tells the story of a vain prince who is turned into a hideous beast, until he can find a young girl who is able to see his inner beauty and fall in love with him. This 'Beauty and the Beast' does have some entertaining moments of its own creation, mainly when Cogsworth and Lumiere (played to perfection by Ian McKellen and Ewan McGregor) take center stage. But that's about all. Basically everything else I enjoyed about this movie was plucked directly from the 1991 animated version; a version which is arguably one of the greatest Disney films/musicals ever made. Now while I usually hate when people compare remakes to their originals, since when critiquing a film you really want to take that singular film experience and analyze it in as much of a 'bubble' as humanly possible, in regards to Disney's live-action 'Beauty and the Beast', this is simply impossible since it's pretty much a 80-90% shot for shot remake (obviously there are going to be things that must be altered when adapting straight from animation, i.e. you can't possibly show Luke Evans who plays Gaston, eating five dozen eggs unless you want him dead). The main alterations being: the live-action element (or course) the addition of a few new and completely forgettable songs and (spoiler alert) LeFou (played by Josh Gad) is gay now, which probably would have been seen as a more progressive move by Disney if he'd been in more than four scenes. Bill Condon's direction was serviceable, highlighted only by the set design and choreography during the musical numbers, but the CGI was cartoonish to the point of sloppy at times. As for the other performances, Emma Watson as Belle was fine (undoubtedly this would've been my very same critique if she'd starred in 'La La Land') and so was Evans as Gaston. And even though as an actor Dan Stevens, who plays the Beast, usually annoys me because I believe his acting to be 99% facial expression, this facial recognition based CGI character seemed to suit him quite well. Final Thought: I'm still giving this movie a minimal recommendation only because it's not a bad film. As I said, there are entertaining moments, and the songs brought over from the 1991 version are always a pleasure to hear. But if you're going to pay money and take your kids to see 'Beauty and the Beast', why not just stay home and watch the better version?",5,4,11,19 March 2017
Les Misérables," They sing every word!
","First off, I want to do a mini review for all the non-musical fans out there: Musicals aren't for everyone. Furthermore, it is my opinion that 'Les Miserables', while being the most internationally well regarded musical in history, is also the most inaccessible musical for most novices. So, I cannot in good conscious recommend that anybody, who is not already a fan of musicals, or this particular sweeping and grandiose musical, go see 'Les Miserables'.With that said, the following is my review for the people who are probably going to see 'Les Miserables', despite anything that I have to say: Assuming that you are already familiar with the epic identity crisis story of Jean Valjean in 19th-century France, I will be skipping the synopsis rundown all together. 'Les Miserables' features a star studded cast, the likes of Hugh Jackman as Jean Valjean, in the role he was born to play and is absolutely superb in, Russell Crowe playing Javert, Valjean's adversary, Anne Hathaway as Fantine, who is also quite excellent here, showing off her exceptional singing voice as she nails 'I Dreamed a Dream', Sacha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter, who add some much needed levity as Thenardier and Madame Thenardier, Amanda Seyfried as Cosette, Eddie Redmayne as Marius and Daniel Huttlestone as Gavroche, who despite his age, has one of the best singing voices of the lot. OK, it's true that not everybody here can sing, i.e. Seyfried who seems very pitchy and Redmayne, who has one of the weirdest singing voice I've ever heard. But Jackman, who is clearly in his comfort zone and can sing this musical under any condition (even waist deep in feces) and Hathaway and Crowe are so strong here that the others lack of stage talent can be forgiven.The one true nagging problem here (much like Peter Jackson choosing to shoot 'The Hobbit' in 48 fps) is director Tom Hooper's choice to record all the singing live, which creates a very distracting atmosphere throughout. Allow me to explain: What Hooper actually did was fit all the actors with earpieces, which fed them the music, so only the actors could really hear the music and sing along. The problem with this is, that within the first ten minutes there arises a disjointed feeling when pertaining to the audio, making Jackman, Crowe and Hathaway all sound like they are singing either out of key or simply singing along with a track in the same way you might sing along to your favorite song in the car. Also, because maybe live acoustics aren't picked up as clearly as acoustics recorded in a studio and dubbed in later, at times the orchestra (which seemed to be layered in during post production) seemed to be lowered to the point where I felt that I wasn't getting that surround sound cinema quality that I'm used to hearing in a theater. Whatever it was, when listening and watching this film, it is very noticeable that something is audibly off as a direct result of the vocals having been recorded live.Hooper, who is sure to get Academy recognition for his masterful direction, constructs a beautifully shot, to say the least, adaptation of Victor Hugo's novel turned musical. When Hooper shows the dingy slumps of France, the scenery is so gritty that you can smell it. But aside from Hooper's work on the visuals, the fact that this film contains the best wardrobe and set design of any movie to come out of 2012, should not be overlooked.Final Thought: Is this the best picture of the year (a la 'King's Speech' material)? No. Would this be considered as one of the top ten must see films of the year? Probably not. As great of a story as 'Les Miserables' is, it's not without its faults, and will undoubtedly overstay its welcome with its unnaturally prolonged 15 minute conclusion; but if you are a fan there is a lot to appreciate here.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited Nicole I.

Zero Dark Thirty," 10 Years in the Making
","Mimicking what more than likely every other critic has already said, 'Zero Dark Thirty' will undoubtedly be a heavy favorite to receive an Oscar for Best Picture of the year; especially considering the Academy's past love affair with director Kathryn Bigelow's overrated film 'The Hurt Locker'.With a haunting opening scene (which may be hard for some to listen to) and an exceptionally handled final shot (actually, final 30 minutes), 'Zero Dark Thirty' brings to life the decade-long search for Osama bin Laden by the CIA, after 9/11. OK, so even though I went in (like most American's) with an understanding of the gravity of the subject matter, as well as the importance of what a movie like this should mean to an American audience, at times (especially during the first 90 minutes) I consciously didn't feel like I was as invested in the story as much as Bigelow wanted me to be. And what that equates to is simply, if you aren't that interested in seeing a movie about the manhunt for Osama bin Laden, then 'Zero Dark Thirty', while may hold your attention, may also not come off as the masterpiece many are hailing it to be. Aside from that, aesthetically speaking, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is very well directed and constructed. The sectioned out chapters Bigelow inserts throughout, work quite well as brief exposition amidst a somewhat complex timeline, and while (as an audience member) you are sure to feel the length of this movie (coming in at 157 minutes) that is probably intentional, if only to add to the atmosphere of the entire piece; as a movie about a grueling 10 year manhunt shouldn't speed by in 90 minutes.In saying all of that, there are a few stand-out aspects that 'Zero Dark Thirty' brings to the table, which are alone worth the price of admission. First off, the ability of Jessica Chastain to steal the show should finally be acknowledged here. After getting some past awards season love for her stand-out performances in both 'The Tree of Life' and 'The Help', Chastain as the protagonist Maya, a CIA operative who spearheaded the attempt to kill bin Laden, gives the best performance of her (still blossoming) career. This tremendously layered character that Mark Boal has written could have easily been overdramatized and turned into an Erin Brockovich (girls can do it too) performance, but Chastain plays it with just the right amount of tempered command, giving Maya a sense of reliability. Her performance is so interesting, that 'Zero Dark Thirty' eventually turns into a compelling character study as well as historical drama. In fact, the latter part of this film is way more entertaining than the initial hour because of Chastain's award worthy performance. Simply stated: the more this evolves into the Jessica Chastain show, the more watchable 'Zero Dark Thirty' becomes.Secondly (and maybe most importantly) Bigelow does something quite gutsy here. While not giving audiences a sympathetic look at members of al-Qaeda, Bigelow does make it a point to show how intelligent the enemy was. This differs from the American cinema norm of making the American's constantly the smartest ones in the room, instead creating a more accurate depiction of a big and powerful America versus a small but elusive and very tactically aware enemy. Furthermore, Bigelow's 'atmosphere of realism' throughout (especially in the final act, when SEAL Team 6 kills OsamaSpoiler Alert, I guess) will be what ultimately solidifies 'Zero Dark Thirty' as a memorable film for most. In all actuality, this same sense of realism is the most interesting thing to come out of the initial hour, occurring during sequences which are sure to be seen as highly controversial, where supposed terrorist are TORTURED by members of the CIA, with the intent of obtaining intelligence. Though these scenes are not unique to this film, in fact 'waterboarding' is a tactic that has been used a multitude of times by bad guys (or brown people) in many generic American action movies set abroad, what Bigelow does here is use the similar waterboarding sequence and suffocates it with her own unique style of gritty realism; in turn, creating sequences American audiences would have been unfazed by in any other film, and making them quite hard to watch (and rightfully so). Also, by making the only TORTURING done in this film be executed by members of the CIA (an agency well respected in American cinema) she makes these same scenes strangely alluring.Final Thought: As heavy as the premise and the Aaron Sorkin-esque dialogue is, Bigelow does interject a few scenes of suspense amidst it all, which shows her understanding of historical entertainment (though this is not as entertaining as 'Argo', but hey). So, because of Bigelow's direction, her the lack of punches pulled and Chastain's performance, 'Zero Dark Thirty' is definitely a film to take strong notice of this awards season. Plus, considering the amount of high praise this movie is getting (by others) the least that can be said about 'Zero Dark Thirty' is that this is Kathryn Bigelow finally solidifying herself as the best director in the 'War in Afghanistan based drama' genre.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

12 Years a Slave," Solidifying my hatred of the South.
","Acclaimed director Steve McQueen (Shame, Hunger) and writer John Ridley's depressingly fascinating adaptation of Solomon Northup's autobiography '12 Years a Slave', just as the title suggests, tells the story of a free man (Northup) who in 1841 was abducted, sold into slavery and would spend the next twelve years of his life as a slave.As one would imagine, a lot of the imagery here is hard to watch due to the subject matter. So, aside from McQueen's habit of coaxing excellent performances from his actors, if you know McQueen's work, then you know that he loves his long takes; with intent always looking towards forcing audiences to gaze upon his subject(s) unblinkingly. Anyway, in this film he focuses the majority of his long takes on sequences of the most upsetting aspects of slavery.But even more visually heartbreaking, and this is almost totally due to a powerhouse performance from Chiwetel Ejiofor (who plays Northup) is watching Northup's spirit slowly break, as he comes to the realization that with each passing moment the likelihood of him regaining his freedom becomes less and less of a reality.What truly sets this film apart as one of the year's best, is both a script (which not only blueprints a realistic view of everyday life on a plantation, but also contains intriguing commentary on everything from the justifications for slavery found in Bible verses, to the fact that the moral values of plantation owners differed from man to man) and a cornucopia of incredible performances. In fact, '12 Years a Slave' is one that should be up for tons of awards; assuredly nominations for Ejiofor and co-stars Michael Fassbender and Lupita Nyong'o (and even though she will be forgotten in this ensemble, the great actress Adepero Oduye's performance should be noted as well) and hopefully an Oscar win for Ridley and his masterful screenplay.Final Thought: Yes, if you're looking to see Django Unchained 2, '12 Years a Slave' (while still containing strong violence and brutality that will make you squirm in your seat) may be too meditative for your liking. And yes, if it wasn't for the title, the timeline in this movie would have been extremely unclear. And yes, from the looks of it, Brad Pitt will never change his hair style no matter what the role. But even at its most preachy, even at its most deliberately paced moments and even if Pitt's accent is distractingly similar to the one he used in 'The Counselor' and 'Inglourious Basterds', '12 Years a Slave' is still one of the most profoundly compelling movies to come out of 2013 and a must see for all of those poor misguided moviegoers who thought 'Lee Daniels' The Butler' was a brave piece of African American cinema.",9,2,8,9 November 2013
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise vs. Bill Murray
","At first I thought maybe (just maybe) being an outspoken mouthpiece for the Scientology movement predisposes an actor to star in high caliber sci-fi films, but I think John Travolta would have something to say about that. Synopsis: When an alien race attacks Earth, a cowardly military officer (Tom Cruise) is put on the front line in order to participate in a futuristic end-of-days, Normandy-esque battle. And to top it off, after he dies on the battlefield (not a spoiler) he soon discovers that he is somehow being forced to live that same day over and over again; which by default, forces him to find a way out of his Twilight Zone worthy predicament. Basically, 'Edge of Tomorrow' is an action genre version of 'Groundhog Day', set in a dystopian future. Side Note: Whatever you think of the man and his religious beliefs, Tom Cruise does know his way around a Hollywood action blockbuster.The most surprisingly pleasant aspect about 'Edge of Tomorrow' has to be the dark humor throughout. In fact, with all the humor this film has to offer and a plot which loosely mimics one of Bill Murray's most beloved comedies, some may question the idea to cast Cruise as the lead. Yet, those who saw 'Tropic Thunder' know that he has a sense of humor. And the fact that he displays a more than competent level of comedic timing, without coming off as annoying, desperate or forced, does deserve kudos.But Cruise's performance isn't the main reason as to why 'Edge of Tomorrow' works as well as it does. Some stand-out supporting work from Emily Blunt and Bill Paxton (who nearly steals the show at times) and the smartly constructed script from Christopher McQuarrie, Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth, help as well. But above all, it's the fantastic direction from Doug Liman (The Bourne Identity, Mr. & Mrs. Smith) which allows 'Edge of Tomorrow' to be far better than it had any right to be. In fact, he single-handedly transforms the repetitive nature of the story structure, which (in lesser hands) could have come off as excruciatingly boring, into something that is edge-of-your-seat entertainment.Final Thought: Even though the third Act sees a more generic Mission Impossible, save the world Tom Cruise, as the film becomes more reliant on the action aspect rather than creative storytelling, and the plot inevitably stumbles into a sci-fi pitfall sequence drowning in over-complex explanation, AND the ending doesn't make a whole lot of sense, at the end of the day, none of that matters. And do you know why? Because, as a whole 'Edge of Tomorrow' is supremely entertaining on every level, with an originality which will assuredly play to today's audiences the same way 'Groundhog Day' played to audiences in 1993.",9,4,8,9 June 2014
Whiplash," 'Drumline' for White People
","'Whiplash' is a DRAMA (not comedy) about a drum student, Andrew (Miles Teller) who attends a prestigious music conservatory with dreams of becoming 'one of the greats' in the world of jazz percussion. His talent and sheer desire lands him in the class of the most notable jazz instructor on campus, Terrence Fletcher (J.K. Simmons); an emotionally and (at times) physically abusive man who militaristically and controversially pushes his students past their limits, in his quest to stop at nothing to find the next great jazz musician.This is a film which is either a lesson in how not to be content with mediocrity, or an examination of an abusive relationship. Whatever it is, experiencing the journey Andrew takes throughout as he decides whether to travel down a path which may lead to fame and isolation or the path which leads to a normal life, but away from his obsession, is fascinating.Writer/director Damien Chazelle's directorial style here seems to be one of simply laying down the tracks (or keeping the camera rolling) so as not to derail his two converging leads (Simmons and Teller). And in a movie which is so performance driven, this is all I could've asked from a director; to get the hell out of the way and let these powerhouses do their thing. But if I had to pay Chazelle a single individual compliment (other than the perfect use of heavily technical lingo throughout, while still keeping everything understandable for those not as familiar with reading music or tempo) it would have to be for his superb construction of the final ten minutes of 'Whiplash', which includes the choice to hold on that final sequence (apologies for being so vague) and allow it to reach its natural conclusion.The one issue I had with this movie actually stems from J.K. Simmons' larger than life/scene-chewing performance, which while attention grabbing, at many points distracted from the film's dramatic element. In truth, this aspect may be the fault of Chazelle's script, which has Simmons spewing the most degrading and comically mean spirited lines of dialogue. The problem with that is: I didn't know if his character was meant to be intimidating or just comically mean, since the instances when he is berating these young students, making them play drums to the point of exhaustion, made me want to laugh, simply on the basis of his verbiage. The act of watching someone struggle and suffer while someone spews funny one-liners, just doesn't quite work. On the other hand, for some, his performance may only add to the adrenaline dump of this movie.Final Thought: A lot of Oscar buzz will be focused on Simmons' performance. It will draw comparisons to R. Lee Ermey in 'Full Metal Jacket'. But forget all of that! The real star of the show is Miles Teller, who gives an electrifyingly exhausting performance, both emotionally and physically. One year ago he was in a movie called 'The Spectacular Now', and gave a performance which began his ascension into the stratosphere of young actors everybody should keep an eye on. 'Whiplash' sees Teller at his apex. He not only deserves an Award nomination, but also the career Shia LaBouf would have had if he'd not A-holed it all away.",8,1,4,3 November 2014
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Real American Hustle
","This entire film is on cocainein a good way.By now Martin Scorsese can write his own ticket. But his newest film, 'The Wolf of Wall Street', based on self proclaimed born entrepreneur Jordan Belfort's own bestselling book about his rise and fall in the stock market scene of the late 80's through the late 90's, is surely the most vulgar and outlandish Scorsese film to date. It is a true wonder how 'The Wolf of Wall Street' doesn't pull an NC-17 rating. But if that sounds like a knock, it's quite the opposite. The sheer ballsy-ness of this production is in fact, inspiring. It is inspiring to see a master like Scorsese evolve and constantly look to push the boundaries of film.If there is one thing Scorsese knows how to do, it's how to take fascinating characters who have lived spectacularly eventful lives and create a fascinating and eventful movie. And the character of Jordan Belfort is not only the wildest character Scorsese has put to screen, but is arguably his most interesting and complex character as well. Sorry, Henry Hill and Jake LaMotta. Played by one of the most dynamic actors working today, Leonardo DiCaprio who is absolutely unleashed, it doesn't hurt that 'The Wolf of Wall Street' also contains the best ensemble cast of the year. Jon Bernthal, Matthew McConaughey, Jon Favreau, P.J. Byrne, Jean Dujardin, Joanna Lumley, Kyle Chandler (in his best role to date) Rob Reiner (in his best role to date) newcomer and Australian born actress Margot Robbie (who fakes a substantially better New Jersey accent than Scarlett Johansson in 'Don Jon') and Jonah Hill (and his fake teeth) if it were at all possible, should all receive Oscar recognition for their parts in this film.While I still believe 'American Hustle' contains a more flushed out script, because of how unapologetic Terence Winter's writing is in 'The Wolf of Wall Street', he should (barring a spectacular upset) garner the Oscar for best adapted screenplay of the year. That said, as much as I enjoyed the flow of this particular plot, shockingly there isn't a whole lot of story for a three hour movie. Hell, 50% of this movie is dedicated to sequences containing wild sex/drug orgies. Also, similar to a 'pure comedy', the plot of 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is highly tangential. Hence, it is about an hour longer than it needed to be, as during most sequences Scorsese allows his A-list actors to riff for minutes at a time, with no real purpose other than to evoke laughs. That said, with the lack of story, there is enough entertainment value to fill a four hour movieso, there you go.Greed is still good. Maybe the primary reason why 'The Wolf of Wall Street' works so well is because of a certain something (a motivational adrenaline pump) within it. That same certain something which makes everybody stand up and shadow box in their living rooms after watching 'Rocky'. Seriously, at one point, during the conclusion of one of Leo's rallying the troop speeches, I was so pumped up and motivated, that I wanted to go out and make a few cold calls myself.Final Thought: This high octane, hilarious, bonkers script on horse steroids, in conjunction with one of the greatest directors alive doing some of his finest work, in conjunction with a cast that seemed to all be feeding off of one another's energy, is the reason why 'The Wolf of Wall Street' is the most fun I've had in a theater all year.",9,1,5,29 December 2013
Dark Shadows," Scarily boring.
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland As a comedy, 'Dark Shadows' doesn't work at all, but as a film that goes out of its way to alienate anybody who hasn't seen the original 1960's cult soap opera, director Tim Burton (Alice in Wonderland, Beetlejuice) does a spectacular job. Not only does 'Dark Shadows' fall well short of the 6 laugh benchmark, the eccentrically scattered tone of the film, which stems from this Seth Grahame-Smith (The Hard Times of RJ Berger) script, makes an under 2 hour film seem like a battle of attrition just to keep from falling asleep. Sure, Johnny Depp (Rango, Edward Scissorhands) looks like he had a blast camping it up as Barnabas Collins (his idol, no doubt)and Helena Bonham Carter (The King's Speech) is ridiculously superb here as Dr. Julia Hoffman (for the ten minutes she is in this movie), but for anybody watching, 'Dark Shadows' is almost entirely a disappointment.Side Note: I understand, there are a slew of other A-list actors in this film, BUT if I haven't bothered to name them, then their performances undoubtedly did not warrant it. Simple as that.This Burton production is a revival of the camp television classic 'Dark Shadows', now set in 1972, when one Barnabas Collins returns back home to his beloved Collinwood Manor (located in the tiny town of Collinsport, Maine) only to find that his relatives have driven what was left of his once lucrative fishing company, into the ground. Now he must take down the rival fishing company in order to regain his family's prominence. Oh, and did I mention that the head of the rival company is a vindictive witch, whom long ago had cursed Barnabas, transforming him into a vampire after killing his one true love? Oh, I didn't? Wellno worries because that storyline really doesn't add to the entertainment value of the film anyways.The idea of remaking this cult television classic may seem interesting on paper, but in all actuality, the plot here is nothing audiences haven't seen a hundred times before in a hundred other movies. A man (or whatever) from another time is somehow transported to the present day (or near present day) and we watch as he stumbles around, struggling with modern electronics for an hour and a half. So, even thought it becomes quite obvious 2 seconds into 'Dark Shadows' that, for Burton, this is a labor of love, it all really doesn't matter, because the storyline grows more and more uninteresting as the film progresses. I will say this though; the climax of the film is very entertaining, if not extremely weird in a very 'Dark Shadows' way. But the amount of boring satire one has to wade through is not worth the payoff.Final Thought: I'll make this short and sweet. As much as 'Dark Shadows' could not have been directed by any other director, this is clearly not one of Burton's better movies. This is not even 'Adam's Family' funny. In fact, 'Dark Shadows' may only work to reinforce the sad fact that the only reason many middle aged people loved the original series, is because they were all seven years old when they first saw it.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Taken 2," Taken as well.
","As far as by the numbers revenge movies go, 'Taken 2' is nothing more than a tamed down (PG-13) cinematic impersonation of its undeniably entertaining predecessor. Directed by Olivier Megaton, the beginning of 'Taken 2' sees the return of Liam Neeson as retired CIA agent Bryan Mills, visibly distressed by the revelation that his daughter has started dating boys behind his back. But that's not the sole reason for his aggravation, because not only has his daughter betrayed his trust, it also comes to light that she has been skirting her driving lessonsafter having already failed her test 4 times! Wait, what's with all of this storyline?! Get to the 'taking' already! Anyway, after about thirty minutes or so, there is a story centered around the father of one of the men Bryan had killed in the previous film (who distractingly resembles The Most Interesting Man in the World) taking it upon himself to exact revenge on Bryan's entire family, by attempting to TAKE themhostage. And while moments (very few) of this particular storyline do contain a sort of likeness to what one might call 'entertainment', 'Taken 2' ends in abysmally cheesy style, with one of the most (although incredibly quick) tacked on finales I've seen in recent years; befitting a straight to video production. To those who think I am harping on 'Taken 2' for its predictable storyline, I'm not. Because that, as well as the (I would suspect) very intentional corniness throughout, is quite forgivable; and is in fact what I expected from a movie called 'Taken 2'. What isn't forgivable is the fact that the direction, especially during the fight sequences (aka the most important sequences of the movie) was mostly undecipherable. And even when the camera settled down enough for audiences to distinguish who is being hit, said fight scenes were utterly uneventful and terribly choreographed; clearly highlighting a Liam Neeson that can't move around so well anymore. And does it make me sound morbid that I was very upset not to see any type of torture scene in this movie? I can't be the only one.Allow me to go one step further by saying 'Taken 2' is riddled with a cornucopia of stupid scenes, which all together ruin any 'coolness factor' it could have had. If you don't believe me, here's a very long example: After Bryan Mills and his wife (or ex-wife, or whatever) are cornered by the Albanian 'bad guys' at gunpoint, Bryan proceeds to take out his cell phone and call his daughter (who is still back at the hotel). The 'bad guys' apparently let him do this for some reason. Anyway, he explains to his daughter that his wife (or ex-wife, or whatever) are going to be 'taken' and that she must now hide because Albanians are likely coming to 'take' her as well. Upon hearing this, his dumb daughter doesn't seem to know where to hide (it's not like she hasn't done this before) so Bryan tells her, right in front of the 'bad guys', to hide in the closet. OK, so this happens about 45 minutes into the movie, but here's the thing: It had already been established many times before that the 'bad guys' spoke and understood English. But it comes to be, that even though Bryan tells his daughter where to hide, right in front of the 'bad guys', in a language everyone in the film seems to understand, the 'bad guys' still can't seem to locate her brilliant hiding space. But maybe I'm overthinking this. I guess it could have been that the 'bad guys' simply forgot how to understand English in that moment, or maybe Neeson's accent was just too thick for them to comprehend? I don't know. Anyway, this movie is filled with scenes of that nature, including an inane and rather long sequence, which involves Bryan's daughter throwing grenades off of rooftops, with seemingly no reaction from the locals. Final Thought: 'Taken 2' is what happens when Hollywood producers attempt to milk every last drop of story out of an original premise that wasn't that deep to begin with. Not to say that this is entirely unwatchable, between Neeson's dry comedic timing and his facial expressions which seem to say 'how many minutes until we break for the day?' there are moments of levity that could be seen as 'so bad that it's good' camp. But, by the end of 'Taken 2', it will have become apparent to everyone in the theater that not even Neeson (the newest Hollywood action hero) could have saved a movie that is destined to be shown at 3 A.M. on Showtime.

Straight Outta Compton," Kinda Soft
","If you're interested, then this movie will be interesting; at least for a while (more or less the first 90 minutes of this 2 ½ hour bio-'epic'. 'Straight Outta Compton' tells the story of revolutionary rap group, N.W.A. (Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, Eazy-E, MC Ren, Dj Yella). Kicking off on the streets of Compton, California 1986 and documenting the groups rise as the pioneers of 'gangsta rap', their tumultuous break up, allegedly due to underhanded management from Jerry Heller (Paul Giamatti) and introducing branches of rap legends which expanded from the N.W.A. tree, e.g. Snoop Dogg, Tu-Pac, etc. Problem is (much like that last sentence) the movie is just too damn long! And once Eazy-E starts coughing, the whole thing turns into an after school special, primarily due to an overarching repetitive atmosphere which director F. Gary Gray (Friday, Set It Off) seems to choose over subtlety more often than not. There were a few sequences that made me lean forward in my seat (The live performance of 'F--- the Police', for one) and the script itself from Jonathan Herman and Andrea Berloff (World Trade Center) does its job; even going above and beyond at times, inserting a few 'audience winks' throughout (I mean, there's even a 'bye Felicia' joke thrown into the mix). But it was the acting which was undoubtedly the stand-out aspect of this movie, highlighted by a performance from Ice Cube's own son, O'Shea Jackson Jr., who, in his first ever acting gig, hits it out of the park playing his father. Here's the problem: The difference between 'Straight Outta Compton' and an actual N.W.A. album is one carries a gritty, raw authenticity, and the other stars Paul Giamatti. Not to say that there aren't guns in this movie (or drugs or police brutality for that matter) but the fact that 'Straight Outta Compton' looks so cinematic is an issue. When comparing this to a movie like 'Boyz n the Hood', which while 'fiction', portrays an honest and personal look into the streets of Los Angeles during a similar time frame, I can safely say that I remember finding myself absolutely immersed in John Singleton's depiction of said setting; to the point where by the end I felt as if I knew the neighborhood without even setting foot in the neighborhood. In retrospect this form of direction aided in my bond with other aspects of the film, acting as the connective tissue between me and the characters on screen. 'Straight Outta Compton' portrays true to life characters, all who actually grew up in Compton, but Gray's glossy (and viciously repetitive) direction really gives viewers more of a distracting XD version of a story that deserved a grittier presentation. Final Thought: It is obvious that Gray has a talent for music video direction and the cinematography here is technically perfect; just not for this movie, and thus curbing my viewing experience and creating a disconnect which resulted in me getting bored after the 90 minute mark. By the way: Everyone who isn't dead, in prison or white gets out of this film scot-free. And while I am not an expert on the breakup of N.W.A. (I was around 5 when it actually happened) the fact that this film took 10 years (as stated by Ice Cube himself) to make, leads me to believe a multitude of financial parties had to come to an agreement as to what could be shown and what past actions could do damage in the court of public opinion, and thus would need to be left on the cutting room floor. So, just a heads up: this is not a scathing expose detailing Dr. Dre's abuse towards women, or anything like that. That said, this fact should not be held against the film itself, as it really has no bearing on ones viewing experience. Still, I believe that audiences have the right to know before entering the theater.",6,10,46,18 August 2015
The Woman in Black," What a way to bring in Black History Month.
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Yet another old fashioned and all too predictable ghost story (by today's standards),sloppily adapted into a feature length film, 'The Woman in Black' is aforgettable attempt by Daniel Radcliffe to shed his Harry Potter image. Directed by James Watkins (The Descent: Part 2), adapted for the bigscreen in unimpressive fashion by Jane Goldman (Kick-Ass, X-Men: First Class) and starring the aforementioned Daniel Radcliffe (the Harry Potter series), this film tells a ghost story set in the creepiest village in England. Oh, how original. The plot is centered around the tale of a ghost-woman or 'woman in black' who haunts a gloomy old mansion located in this village, every so often coming out to terrorize the residents by making their children kill themselves. A young lawyer/single father comically named Arthur Kipps (Radcliffe) must travel to said village and enter the haunted house (mansion) because...well because every story needs conflict I'm guessing. In fact, it isn't even important why he goes into the mansion at all, because once there he must go through the hacky haunted house routines which every audience member has paid to see. He must stay overnight in the haunted mansion (for some reason), investigate weird noises coming from that room down the hall, walk up and down creaky flights of stairs, see scary faces in the window and then rub his eyes only to find that the faces have gone, etc. To say the least, the protagonist's actions are not only predictable, but also laughable at times. Very early on it will ring clear to the audience, that knowing who certain people are or why Daniel Radcliffe aka Mr. Kipps doesn't leave the house after he is attacked by the woman in black the first time, is irrelevant. But here is the kicker: storyline aside, acting aside, horrid editing (some of the worst I have seen in modern cinema) aside, there are legitimate scares here! And it pains me to say this, but scares which are so legitimate, that they may be worth paying to see for some viewers.'The Woman in Black' is a film which relies Exclusively on pop-out scares (things jumping out of corners, sudden loud noises after long stints of silence, etc.) and extreme close ups on creepy children's wind-up toys. And as horror film 101 as that may seem, director James Watkins makes these simplistic scares highly entertaining. Even through the far too tedious Scooby-Doo routines (where Radcliffe chases the ghost into one room, meanwhile the ghost runs into an adjacent room chasing Radcliffe, which occur over and over again for the entirety of the film) Watkins succeeds in keeping most audiences in a constant state of suspense, by creating a domino effect of cheap but very effective scares.The real problem with 'The Woman in Black' basically stems from the filler, or instances during the movie where the scares are not happening. Whenever one of the characters has to read something or talk to someone the movie screeches to a halt. And even though Watkins does a good job of producing scares, the film still contains major camera work problems, for instance: There are long sequences where tons of reading of letters and documents must be done by the audience, in order to obtain back-story on the infamous woman in black. But when these close-ups on all too important old, tattered letters, written in illegible cursive are presented, as an audience member I could barely make out what they said. Therefore, missing much of the back-story to the point where I simply stopped paying attention to the story all together. But the biggest issue with this film comes into play often, and it has to do with the villain (the woman in black). A horror film usually lives or dies on how powerful or threatening the 'bad guy' is. In the case of this woman in black (and I don't want to give too much away) while she does have murderous rage, she doesn't seem to be able to physically hurt anybody. She gives off this high pitch screams and runs at you, and that is about it. And yes, while she does make children kill themselves, if one doesn't have children then this woman in black is only about as annoying as a common housefly. If fact, the blandness of this villain is a huge reason this film doesn't work.As for Radcliffe, who goes from fighting Sirius Black to the woman in black, he doesn't give that bad of a performance here. It is just a shame that he is horrendously miscast. His character is presented as a father of a young child, when he himself looks like a sixteen year old boy! And to make matters worse, when he ventures off into the old English village, he is surrounded by parents that also have small children, but said parents are all visibly in their forties and fifties. So, due to a strange lack of make-up, the baby-face of Radcliffe only made him seem that much younger amidst his weathered supporting cast.Final Thought: If after reading this review and you still wish to see this, maybe you don't know how to read. But my advice would be, in order to have a good time with this material,pay no attention to the nonsensical and barely applicable storyline or the downright confusing ending, because it doesn't take away from the fact that 'The Woman in Black' holds around ten legitimate scares throughout. In saying that, I am still in no way recommending this film to people who are interesting in an entertaining storyline, or a well done scary movie, or simply a good film.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

The Dark Knight Rises," Marvel, eat your heart out.
","Reminding us all why Christopher Nolan's 'Dark Knight' films are a cut above all other superhero movies, Nolan unleashes the final chapter of his Batman vision, 'The Dark Knight Rises', on the world. Christian Bale is back as Bruce Wayne (aka Batman) and so is the great Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox and Michael Caine as the outspoken butler Alfred. But along for the ride this time are the likes of Tom Hardy (Warrior) as Bane (who surprisingly isn't as muscular here as he was in 'Bronson') Anne Hathaway (The Devil Wears Prada) as Catwoman, Joseph Gordon-Levitt (50/50) as John Blake (but he may also go by a different name, wink, wink) and Marion Cotillard (Midnight in Paris) as Miranda Tate. And even with this star studded cast, Nolan's vision is still the real star of the show, because along with the larger than life visuals audiences have grown accustomed to when watching a Nolan film, this masterful writer/director's plot construction abilities continue to impress. With 'The Dark Knight Rises' he has created one of the most complex superhero story lines ever and not only ties up all of the loose ends by the end of the film, but ties them up with a flair and veracity that has become synonymous with a Christopher Nolan film. In fact, 'The Dark Knight Rises' contains the perfect ending to a damn near perfect trilogy (screw you David Letterman). An ending, in fact, which makes up for every single Joel Schumacher, Val Kilmer, Tommy Lee Jones, George Clooney, Chris O' Donald, Jim Carrey and Arnold Schwarzenegger piece of crap.The Plot: Set eight years after 'The Dark Knight', when Gotham is basically a crimeless city and Bruce Wayne has long since hung up his Batman persona. In fact, Bruce Wayne has been reduced to a crippled (from years of crime-fighting) recluse. Yes, Nolan goes out of his way to demonstrate that Wayne is a destructible human being, lacking superpowers; thus, making things all the more compelling when Bane, a 'roided up freak, comes to town with plans to blow everything to smithereens. Side Note: This aspect is sort of comical only because Bane's platform, coming into Gotham, is to punish the rich and powerful and give the town back to the people; sort of an ultra-violent manifestation of the Occupy Wall Street movement of recent years...well, I thought it was funny.Anyway, there are really only a few issues which hinder this film: 1. The voice Hardy has chosen for Bane is something audiences will have to get used to. And while at times his voice does verge on something of an annoying Sean Connery imitation (it doesn't help that because of his mouthpiece, much of Bane's dialogue is indecipherable) the more Bane is on the screen, the better the actual film becomes.2. This movie starts off extremely (EXREMELY) slowly! Yes, I understand that Nolan is a master of dialogue driven set ups; and while the second half payoff is very much worth it, for almost the entirety of the first half I found myself waiting for the next explosion...or for Anne Hathaway to say something clever.3. And maybe the least important, 'The Dark Knight Rises' runs into the same PG-13 problem the first two films did; a la using odd edits to hide the on-screen violence. All I will say is that in creating a PG-13 world, with gunfire but no blood, no matter how dark Nolan wants these films to be, 'The Dark Knight' series seems like it will never be his entire vision. Not to say, Nolan doesn't do a magnificent job with working within his restraints.With that said, these are very miniscule issues when the cold facts are that everything else about this final chapter works and works rather brilliantly. Bale gives probably his best Batman performance yet. But let's face it; very few people come to 'The Dark Knight' films to hear Bale talk in a deep voice. Since its inception (no, I couldn't think of any other word to use) Nolan's versions of Batman have lived and died on the strength of the villain(s). And while nobody can even hope to touch Heath Ledger's Joker, Hardy as Bane is a worthy successor, mostly because of a brilliantly constructed back-story. But even more impressive than the Bane character itself is the performance of Hathaway, who steals the show as Catwoman, basically carrying much of the dullish first half on her shoulders and reviving it often (take that Halle Berry!).Final Thought: Is 'The Dark Knight Rises' better than 'The Dark Knight' (the previous film)? Well, in this reviewer opinion, it's neither better nor worse, it is simply different. Here is the real question: Is 'The Dark Knight Rises' better than the 'The Avengers'? You bet your ass it is!

Monsters University," Yes, there is a paddling scene!
","I infamously hadn't seen 'Monsters Inc.' until earlier this year. And even after I did, I was lukewarm about it. I mean, it was a creative concept and all, but aside from the visuals, the overall likability of Mike Wazowski and the cuteness factor of Boo, for me it didn't seem to sustain the heightened entertainment value I deemed fit in order to have secured a spot in the upper echelon of the Pixar power rankings. So, going into 'Monster University', I was highly skeptical that past the 'college' gimmick, this was going to be more of the same, just with more monsters and Mike in a retainer. Suffice to say, I was wrong. In only the second college themed movie to receive a G rating, this prequel to 2001's 'Monster's Inc.' takes a look back at the relationship between Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman), and their first meeting as college students at Monsters University (the rival of Scare Tech. as you all know). Mike is introduced as the monster who seems to have the least 'scare potential' but the most heart and Sulley comes in as a jock/legacy, who has it in his mind that he is going to cruise his way through the illustrious Scare program on name and intimidation alone. You can see where this is going. Thematic circumstances dictate that the two must hate each other at first, but eventually work together to take down the jock fraternity, the Alpha Betas (or whatever they are called in this movie) in order to prove that they belong. But while this underdog storyline may sound predictable, it is a combination of the well written comedic dialogue and situations (sans the final act) and insightful commentary on college life, as well as the introduction of more than a few quirky monsters (my favorite being Don, a forty-something student who went back to school 'to learn the computers' ) which allows 'Monsters University' to be a quite enjoyable experience for all ages. But, let's get to the bigger issue at hand. Which is the question: Does 'Monsters University' work without the beloved human character of Boo? The answer is YES. In fact 'Monsters University' begins with elementary school Mike, who is pretty damn adorable, and is seemingly meant to take the place of Boo. And even if young Mike is only on screen for about ten minutes, it works. Well, that's kind of a lie because 'Monsters University' really begins with a Pixar short that isn't so much amazing as it is alarming; but anywayÂ… With very family friendly references to 'Animal House', 'Revenge of the Nerds', 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' and even 'Carrie', director Dan Scanlon (making his feature length Pixar debut) immerses audiences into this collegiate atmosphere, while the writing team of Robert L. Baird, Daniel Gerson, and the director himself put forth a script which proves that G-rated movies can also be funny for adults as well. As always Crystal as the wide-eyed (literally) underdog Mike Wazowski and Goodman as the larger than life Sulley are the stars of the show. But I must make mention of Helen Mirren, who lends her voice to this picture, playing Dean Hardscrabble, the most menacing looking villainess since Ursula. Seriously, she is something out of a Franz Kafka novel. Timely reference, I know. Final Thought: While 'Monsters Inc.' was an interesting concept, 'Monsters University' is clearly the more entertaining film; even if only by the slightest bit. Sure, children under a certain age may not get all of the college references and there is sort of a second ending here where Mike and Sully have a bonding moment, which does make this movie seem overlong (clearly overstaying its welcome for more than a few small children at my screening) and yes, a PG-rated 'Monsters University' would have left the door open for at least one panty raid. But what can I say? The rather hilarious college themed atmosphere, from the spot on orientation sequences, to the college aged monsters in flip flops playing hacky sack on the lawn, to the singing of the Monsters University school song, all had me enjoying this movie maybe more than I should have.

Saving Mr. Banks," An impossible movie to dislike
","Tugging at the heartstrings during the most opportune times, making you feel all warm inside on cue and delivering more than a spoonful of 'fun for the whole family' throughout to counteract the PG-13 moments, 'Saving Mr. Banks' is little more than Disney propaganda. But, when what you essentially have here is a Disney movie, about the making of a Disney movie, portraying Walt Disney, to go in expecting anything scathing would be foolish. That said, 'Saving Mr. Banks' contains more edge to it than Disney's live action, 'The Odd Life of Timothy Green', made for TV movie worthy track record would have you believe.Directed by John Lee Hancock (who is well versed in Disney-fying movies) and written by Kelly Marcel (the writer of the upcoming Fifty Shades of Grey film adaptation) and Sue Smith, this imaginative retelling of the making of Mary Poppins (I say this only because in real life P.L. Travers absolutely hated the 1964 Mary Popping's film) depicts a charismatic, compassionate and non-anti-Semitic Walt Disney (played by Tom Hanks) in his attempts to woo author P.L. Travers for the right to bring her beloved novels to the big screen.The performances all around are excellent, but the standout has to be Emma Thompson, who plays the aforementioned P.L. Travers with the most perfectly disapproving British tone and mannerisms possible. But it is the structure of 'Saving Mr. Banks' which is the most impressive. With the best sequences being some extremely well timed flashbacks showing Travers troubled upbringing with her alcoholic father (brilliantly portrayed by Colin Farrell) which momentarily takes things out of the farcical realm, dousing audiences with an occasional cold splash of welcome weight and realism.Final Thought: At the end of the day all 'Saving Mr. Banks' is, is a film about the making of a film; which on face value may seem fascinating to film students and nobody else. This is also a Disney production, which means the story does not veer from the set in stone generic Disney outline (no matter their differences, in the end every character finds common ground and blah, blah, blah) with a score that instructs viewers how to feel (when Disney tells the story of his hard upbringing, cue the sad music). But there is no doubt the Disney Corporation knows their way around an entertaining film. What can I say? 'Saving Mr. Banks' is a movie that is impossible to dislike.",7,0,2,30 December 2013
Pitch Perfect," What 'Glee' Wishes it Could Be.
","'Pitch Perfect' is basically 'Bring It On', but with a cappella singing groups instead of cheerleadersand it's also a million times funnier. Directed by Jason Moore and adapted by Kay Cannon from Mickey Rapkin's novel, 'Pitch Perfect' tells the story of Beca (played by Anna Kendrick) an aspiring DJ attending Barden University, who's hobbies include seclusion, nonconforming and listening to Mashups (which kind of makes her a conformist). In an attempt to have Beca become more socially active, her father (who is also a professor at the University) urges her to join a club on campus. But upon perusing each club (especially the glee clubs) she quickly decides that the loner lifestyle is far less humiliating. That is, until a rather awkwardly nude run-in with one of the members of the The Bellas, an all-girl a cappella group on campus that sings nothing but Ace of Base. And since The Bellas are coming off of an embarrassing loss at the previous year's singing competition, Beca, as well as a multitude of other 'a ca-losers'; including Fat Amy (as advertized) and Lilly, the girl who can apparently speak no higher than a whisper, are asked to try out in a desperate hope that a group of misfits could be just the thing that sends the conservative Bellas all the way to the finals of the national Glee-esque competition. And if this doesn't sound generic enough, there is also a love story subplot centered around Beca and a guy who looks shockingly like Dane Cook. OK, so if this sounds like every teen flick that you've ever seen, about a misunderstood misfit who ends up helping the popular kids (that were mean to her in the beginning of the movie) win their something-or-other championship/tournament, only to discover that in the end that they are all the same no matter their social standing, then that is only because, from synopsis alone, 'Pitch Perfect is exactly that. But before you write this dark horse off, let me just say that due to a sharply satirical script and a surprisingly hilarious, eccentric and immensely engaging cast, which include the likes of Brittany Snow, Hana Mae Lee, Rebel Wilson (as Fat Amy) Skylar Astin and Anna Kendrick, giving a performance which not only solidifies herself as a true leading lady in any genre, but also as the new Kristen Bell, but with talent, 'Pitch Perfect' does elevate itself far above the mundane-ness of your everyday teen comedy. In fact, from the non-stop laughs, to the quite satirical teenage dialogue, to the perfectly hilarious 'Best in Show'-esque banter from Elizabeth Banks and John Michael Higgins, who play the two commentators of the national a cappella competition, 'Pitch Perfect', aside from a curiously abrupt ending, works on EVERY level; even in its rarest of sappy moments.'Pitch Perfect' vs. 'Glee': The main reason 'Pitch Perfect' works so well is actually quite simple. Where 'Glee' is so in love with its self-proclaimed perception that glee clubs are the new 'cool', this is a comedy that isn't afraid to make fun of a cappella groups, glee clubs and people randomly breaking out into song, while at the same time presenting interesting characters that audiences want to root for. So, if you where thinking of avoiding this film on the basis of your dislike of 'Glee' (or that awful show 'The Sing-Off') but find yourself being dragged to see it anyways, no need to worry because chances are you will be happily surprised by what 'Pitch Perfect' has to offer.Final Thought: Even though most of the comedy here is on the cruder side, this is still a PG-13 venture. In short, 'Pitch Perfect' is not the raunchy female buddy comedy, filled with overlong skits about feces that 'Bridesmaids' was. But good news'Pitch Perfect' is so much more funny and (more importantly) more accessible than 'Bridesmaids' will ever be. What I mean by 'accessible' is, men will be able to watch this movie without hearing the phrase: 'You wouldn't get it because you're a man.' All kidding aside, I haven't seen a comedy with this much clever teenage personality since 'Easy A'. So, in the comedic cesspool that has been 2012, filled with half-assed attempts such as 'That's My Boy' and 'The Watch', 'Pitch Perfect' is not only my pick for the biggest surprise to come out of the genre this year, but also the funniest movie of the year (so far); narrowly edging out '21 Jump Street'.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Godzilla," Mo MUTO's, Mo Problems
","After the Emmerich/Brodrick fiasco of 98, I was all but done with Godzilla movies. So, when I first saw the teaser trailer for 2014's 'Godzilla', I cringed at the thought of having to sit through another American remake starring this beloved movie monster. But what can I say? I'm a hug fan of 'Breaking Bad' and Bryan Cranston is a God. So I went. But suffice to say, I wasn't so much as impressed as I was (by the end of my movie going experience) bored.OK, so before I move forward with my criticism, I just wanted to make it clear that I had no problem with the overdramatic feel director Gareth Edwards uses as his foundation, even throughout the segments of cool visuals and the few strong action sequences in the final Act. To say that a Godzilla film is campy or overdramatic is not really an insult. It's like saying, grass is green or water is wet. In fact, the Japanese inspired camp of it all, is a huge reason as to why people love this franchise to begin with. Now, on to my review: Synopsis: In 1999, after what looks to be a natural disaster takes the wife of Joe Brody (Bryan Cranston) an American engineer stationed in Japan, we fast forward to present time as Joe (now a conspiracy theorist) along with his skeptical son Ford, attempt to uncover the truth behind the odd seismic activity off the coast of Japan. Seismic activity which may lead to the truth behind Joe's wife's death and by default lead them to the discovery of the greatest sea monster inspired cover up in history. From the title, you may have already guessed what this cover up pertains to.The story, in and of itself, is actually quite inventive. That is to say, writer Max Borenstein does a really good job of bringing Godzilla into the modern age and backing his 'return' with some logical reasoning. That said, if not for some timely exposition every half an hour from Ken Watanabe, who plays Dr. Ichio Serizawa, I would have been pretty confused as to what some of the motives of the main characters (Godzilla included) were.The first half of this movie is quiet, but very well choreographed, as the story slowly takes its shape, setting the stage for the arrival of the King of All Monsters. But as the second hour begins to rear its head, things almost all at once hit a wall, as the film continues to set a stage that is now getting cold. And what once looked to be a well structured exercise in suspenseful pacing, soon turned into an exercise of my patience; with every static moment losing that much more of my interest. And here's the kicker: Edwards definitely had a vision as to how and when Godzilla should make his first appearance on screen. And the fact that Godzilla isn't fully visible until the latter half of this film, proves that he wished to gradually elevate the anticipation of audiences. But when we finally do see him (Godzilla) my reaction was shrug inducing at best. This is what I'd been waiting for?! I mean, the last half an hour is action packed and gives fans what they came to see; Godzilla roaring and haphazardly destroying cities. And there are bits of wonderful touches of cinematography laced throughout, which pay direct homage to the old Japanese tokusatsu films that made Godzilla such a pop culture icon to begin with. All I'm saying is, I felt as though I was being hyped up for something visually Guillermo Del Toro inspired, and all I really got was something just above the level of Reptar.Shockingly, the acting and the CGI were not up to par either. Well that isn't all together true. Elizabeth Olsen is quite good here. Problem is, she wasn't given much to do! Starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ken Watanabe, Sally Hawkins and the aforementioned Olsenoh, and with ('with' being the operative word) Bryan Cranston, 'Godzilla' should have been a film where the CGI and performances were dueling for the spotlight. Sadly, both aspects fall short; with the (at times) lackluster CGI taking the lead. I'll say it again, Godzilla was visually quite underwhelming.Taylor-Johnson is asked to carry this movie, but is pretty forgettable in the leading man role. And if you think Olsen gets nothing to do, then Academy Award nominee Sally Hawkins gets even less. As for Ken Watanabe (one of the most respected actors in the world) he spends the entire film with the same shocked expression on his face; which honestly is what the role called for, so I can't really fault him. And what can I say about Cranston's performance, since (spoiler alert) he's barely in the damn movie! Final Thought: If you are a fan of the original Japanese productions, the subject matter alone and/or a plot which harnesses the spirit of those cinematic classics will be enough for you to get through (or even enjoy) a two hour movie which feels like three hours. For the rest of us, 'Godzilla' eventually and unfortunately turns into a slog, that even with its merits, is just too long. What some may see as a slow burn, others (like me) saw as a film that was in need of some heavy editing.",4,0,3,18 May 2014
Looper," 'Disney's The Kid' Part 2
","If you could go back in time and kill baby Hitler, would you? Like 'The Terminator' with a touch of 'Firestarter', 'Looper' is the newest attempt at creating the next revolutionary Sci-Fi film (because everybody wants to make the next 'Blade Runner'). Written and directed by Rian Johnson, the writer/director of the under-appreciated 'Brick', and starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Bruce Willis and Emily Blunt, 'Looper' tells the story of a dystopian year 2044, where 10 percent of the population has developed laughable 'super powers' that don't seem to go beyond levitating quarters and time travel has not yet been invented. But in thirty year's time (in an even more flawed future) time travel will have been invented and quickly outlawed, only to be used by mobsters and the very rich, to send people back to 2044 that they want killed (because in the more distant future it is nearly impossible to get rid of a dead body) and that's where Loopers come in. A Looper is a hired gun of sorts from 2044, who is paid a substantial amount of money (silver) to kill those who are sent back in time by the mob and said very rich. Joe (Levitt) is one of these Loopers. One day he hears a rumor about a man called The Rainmaker, who, from thirty years in the future, is attempting to rid the world of Loopers by sending each Looper's future self back in time for the Looper to in turn, kill. OK, I'll stop here only because I have undoubtedly confused you all by this point, even though there is so much more to this story I could get into, such as the aspect of futuristic drug use, important terminology such as 'closing your loop' and how much makeup one would have to apply if their future self came back in time and looked like Bruce Willis.Levitt's notable transformation: The fact that Levitt and Willis' face look nothing alike, even with a heavy coat of makeup and prosthetics, isn't as distracting (or intriguing) as one would think. In fact, most audiences will become so wrapped up by the story, that they will be inclined to simply ignore any visual flaws this movie has to offer. And aside from the much anticipated makeup aspect of 'Looper', the acting from the two male leads isn't all that memorable. In fact, Emily Blunt and the young boy who plays her son (Pierce Gagnon) practically steal the show. But even more interesting than Levitt and Willis' overshadowed performances, is the tone of 'Looper' throughout. At times playing for laughs and at others playing more for extreme violence, Johnson seems to be in control of most of his story. Issues only arise when the tone of this film is drastically thrown off on two separate occasions. The first major tonal disruption comes during a crucial plot point (aka when the goal of Willis' character is revealed) which I won't give away, but let's just say when the audience I saw this movie with was blindsided by this aggressively dark plot development (involving children) the somewhat light atmosphere in the theater was thrust into an immediate and very uncomfortable silence. The second tonal aberration comes into play with the introduction of a small child (Gagnon) who throws nasty temper tantrums. Though the real star of the show here is Johnson's script, with an almost perfectly structured plot, 'Looper' is only flawed by a few visuals that go awry; all of which are centered around the child character. In short, and not to give too much away, the sequences when the child has his 'tantrums' are filmed in such a way, as to resemble something out of a bad episode of 'Heroes'. And while the unavoidably over-dramatized and unintentionally funny scenes of this child having a fit, in slow motion, doesn't take away anything from this massively intriguing storyline, 'Looper' is a perfect example of a film that would have been much more impactful as a book (if you know what I mean).Final Thought: Is 'Looper' the greatest Sci-Fi movie of the year? Yeah, it probably is, seeing that the amount of movies which would fall under the Sci-Fi genre in 2012 is quite thin. And it is worth seeing for the story structure alone, but visually I wasn't as blown away (aside from a few scenes of visual brilliance) as I thought I was going to be. In saying that, the hype machine may have gotten to me far too prematurely, because at the end of the day 'Looper' is in fact a well constructed piece of Sci-Fi entertainment, which will be thought of by many as being as innovative as 'Inception' was a few years ago (even though 'Inception' was a better Sci-Fi film).Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

The Hangover Part III," Jeffrey Tambor had the right idea.
","Kudos to director Todd Phillips (who should really be directing action flicks) for not giving audiences another carbon copy storyline of the original; even though this movie is set in Las Vegasagain. In saying that, Phillips seemed to have had only one goal in mind when making 'The Hangover Part 3'. And that was to make something better than the insanely lazy and disgusting retread that was 'The Hangover Part 2'. But while this isn't as offensively gross or vulgar, it is offensively tame and dull and uneventful.The Synopsis: Like one of those stupid Fast & Furious sequels, the gang's all back. This includes the likes of Zach Galifianakis as Alan, Ed Helms as Stu, Justin Bartha as the other guy and Bradley Cooper, as the guy who can't put these movies in his rearview fast enough. In this final installment, the guys stage an intervention for Alan becausewell, maybe because it took them three movies to realize how mentally unstable he actually was. They plan a trip together in order to get Alan some treatment, but, through a series of lazily plotted events, they end up getting mixed up with Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) again inYou know what? Instead of writing my usual long-winded review, I will mix it up a little and do something a bit unconventional. Just to preface this next statement, I usually take notes while watching a movie. But, since this was touted (from the trailers) to be the epic finale to these inexplicably beloved comedies, I decided to keep a tally of laughs instead. That is to say, instead of notes I counted all of the times 'The Hangover 3' did its job and made me laugh. Here are the results of my experiment: During this comedy, which had a runtime of 100 minutes, I laughed twice and smirked once. Review over.Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I.

Inside Llewyn Davis," A meditative comedy
","Writer/director/brother duo Joel and Ethan Coen have always been really hit and miss for me (I loved 'No Country for Old Men' and hated 'The Ladykillers', 'Raising Arizona' and truly believe 'The Big Lebowski' is one of the most overrated films of all time) but 'Inside Llewyn Davis', with all of its dry and metaphysical humor, is a homerun.Nearly void of plot, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is sort of a 'day (more like a week) in the life of' story of a relatively homeless folk singer named Llewyn (Oscar Isaac). We follow him as he loses the neighbor's cat (which becomes a living, breathing motif throughout) asks for money, deals with the fact that he may have gotten a woman who hates him (played by Carey Mulligan) pregnant, does session work, rides around in a car with two characters (John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund) whom resemble Pozzo and Lucky from 'Waiting For Godot', and toys with quitting the folk scene for a regular 9 to 5. Now clearly, while this doesn't sound like much in the way of entertainment, that Coen magic somehow makes this little movie one of the best of the year.Finally, Oscar Isaac will get the recognition that he deserves! Yes, as you would probably imagine, the music in this film is great (the soundtrack is worth buying) thoroughly capturing the folk scene in Greenwich Village in 1961. But it is the performances from Isaac, which demands an Oscar nomination and Mulligan, who spends the entire supporting role with a consistent sour puss expression on her face only rivaled by Cate Blanchett's Jasmine, and the intelligent, true-to-life, self deprecating sense of humor which stems from the Coen's immensely clever and incredibly deep conversationally driven script, which deals with issues of relationships, questioning when is it OK to give up on ones dream and a smattering of enlightened ramblings from simple looking characters, as only the Coen's can depict.Final Thought: At the end of the day, it's hard to pin down a clear cut reason as to why I thought 'Inside Llewyn Davis' was so brilliant or why it resonated so much with me. So, I'm going to stop trying.",9,1,4,30 December 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," What did I just watch?!
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland So absurd, it works; with maybe the most shocking aspect of 'The Cabin in the Woods', the new Independent Slasher film from director/co-writer Drew Goddard (Cloverfield), being how this intriguing film had been shelved for almost three years. Beginning as a horror film 101 story and then progressively becoming odder and odder, Goddard seems to have found a new angle in the genre, simply by making a film which is entirely predicated on keeping the audience in a state of confusion, all the while keeping the entertainment level high throughout. And I enjoyed nearly every minute of it. But as much as I enjoyed this odd little horror film, there will undoubtedly be some who will absolutely hate it. Hate it, simply because in the midst of watching the movie, there will come a moment when one must throw out everything they think that they know about the horror films of today; and almost shelve their belief, as it were. And truthfully, that sooner it happens, the more you will enjoy the movie. Maybe the greatest compliment I can give 'The Cabin in the Woods' is that its wide audience appeal, while hard to explain, does definitely exist.Synopsis: Directly referencing Sam Raimi's 'The Evil Dead', 'The Cabin in the Woods' starts off as a pretty routine Slasher film, where 5 teenagers (one slut, one jock, one nerd, one pothead and one good girl) go on vacation to a cabin in the woods (for some reason). It then takes one wildly outlandish turn after another, until it erupts into its gruesome, scary, very smart, funny and (most importantly) fresh climax, that no fan of any genre will see coming. To give you an idea of what I mean by 'outlandish', there is a scene where a unicorn actually impales a man; and it's played for laughs. Yeah, it's that kind of movie. In saying that, 'The Cabin in the Woods', in the age of bad Slasher remake after bad Slasher remake, is one of the most original horror films/horror satires there has been since 'Scream'. Blasphemy, I know. But the fact is, aside from being a film that is punctuated be being released at the right place during the right decade, 'The Cabin in the Woods' is a film well worth checking out.As far as the superb comic timing goes, it does work here on a very self aware level. And this self awareness (or continuous winks at the audience) are so well constructed, that when the violence and overt sexual references do occur, and the film becomes cluttered with satirical references that may be lost on many, the supremely clever sidebars constantly keep 'The Cabin in the Woods' engaging.Side Note: Chris Hemsworth (Thor) and consummate supporting actress Kristen Connolly have substantial roles in this film; as well as the always wonderful Richard Jenkins (The Visitor) and a surprise cameo bywell I won't spoil it. But the acting, excluding Jenkins (who is superb here) will not factor in on whether you loved or hated 'The Cabin in the Woods', so this aspect really isn't worth discussing.Final Thought: I am not going to say that this was better than last year's surprise horror film 'Insidious' or than 2009's seldom seen 'House of the Devil'; it's just different. And again, this type of horror film isn't for everyone. Some may find that the plot twists here so off-the-wall that they may tune out all together. In fact, 'The Cabin in the Woods' will work more for camp horror fans, than for the blood thirsty Slasher lovers, pretty much because it isn't a straight forward Slasher. BUT, as far as satires go, it may only be a notch or two below a film such as 'Shaun of the Dead'. What I mean by that comparison is that, 'The Cabin in the Woods' displays one of the only instances that show a successful horror flick, which audiences can laugh with and not laugh at.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Her," And the Screen Goes Black
","Wasn't there an episode of 'The Big Bang Theory' where Raj falls in love with Siri? Spike Jonze, most notably known for his direction, writes and directs this futuristic tale of a lonely man named Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) who interestingly enough works for a dot-com, where his job is to ghostwrite hand written letters (mostly love letters) to the significant others of those who request them. In the midst of a divorce, he finds romantic companionship with a newly created computer operating system named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson) an operating system that is self aware and ever evolving.The two aspects which impressed me the most: 1. Jonze constructs the most technologically accurate depiction of the future I've seen in recent years. It's the little things really. From the use of voice controlled computer systems to create documents rather than a keyboard, to the countless sequences of crowds walking around outside, never interacting with each other, but instead carrying on conversations via a bluetooth device, are all brilliant touches if only because Jonze doesn't go over-the-top with things. There has been no World War 3, nor have robots taken over the world. This is a nearly recognizable future with facilities, utilities and mannerisms I could see emerging within the next decade.2. Scarlet Johansson's vocal performance and how amazingly weighted it is. Though we never see her body, her presence becomes the most important entity in the room throughout. Her feelings are all too real and more importantly, we feel what she's feeling. I know what you're saying. She's just talking, how powerful could her performance actually be? And to that I would reply: Johansson's performance in 'Her' is the single best of her career.Here's the problem: I imagine that on paper 'Her' comes across as brave and innovative. But visually, the second I thought things would become unintentionally silly, they did. And after said moment, it was hard for me to take anything this movie had to say seriously, no matter how great the ending was. Allow me to explain: If you've seen the trailers, there is a point where Theodore wishes (out loud) that he could touch Samantha. And Samantha replies suggestively, 'How would you touch me?' This cyber innuendo comes across as weird in the trailer and in the film (no matter how necessary to the story the sequence is) it comes off as even stranger, as it becomes clear that the 'Her' film experiment isn't going to work as well as Jonze probably imagined it would. And from there, even though 'Her' still contains a strong aura of impressive questioning, the film stalls out a few more times when it attempts to address relationship issues more applicable to something teen angsty, along the lines of Twilight'. Let's put it this way, it comes across as really awkward when a computer with a female voice is depicted as being jealous.Final Thought: Now obviously this concept leaves the door open for an adult humor remark such as: Aren't all men already in love with their computers? But, because this film doesn't take itself Ridley Scott serious, as there is a comedic tone throughout which alleviates some of the silliness a human and machine love story would've brought to the table if it were directed as a heavy drama, and the fact that Jonze chooses to layer his central theme of human interaction above all, by asking some pretty challenging questions (through thought provoking dialogue) regarding love and relationships, 'Her' is transformed into a truly fresh love story, with a perfect touch of sci-fi.",8,4,9,29 December 2013
In the Land of Blood and Honey," The Bosnian War: A Love Story?
","Written by Markus Robinson, Edited by Nicole I. Ashland Before I begin,I would like to preface this review by saying that I am in no way an expert on the Bosnian War. So, before I receive any hate mail from angry Bosnian's or Serbian's about how I am just a stupid American who is criticizing events that I didn't live through, please realize that I am not criticizing Bosnian's or Serbians or war tactics or cultural differences. My job is to criticize FILMS!!! Angelina Jolie hates Serbians, there I said it! I am joking of course, she loves all races. Angelina Jolie (Salt) receives her first writing and feature film directing credits here in 'In the Land of Blood and Honey'; a film that is surprisingly almost entirely in Serbian and Bosnian. There has been some controversy (at least there was for a few months) about this actually being an idea Jolie stole and called her own. But after all is said and done, whether or not she came up with the original idea will be the least controversial aspect to arise from this film. Starring Zana Marjanovic and Goran Kostic, it is not the acting which drags this film down, it is the storyline Jolie chooses to focus on instead of a straight forward war story. Chronicling the systematic encampment, rape and slaughter of the Bosniak (Bosnian Muslim) ethnic group during the Bosnian War sounds like some very compelling and powerful material, and 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' would have been compelling and powerful, if that was what the movie was about. Instead we get a love story, set in the Bosian War between a high ranking male Bosnian Serb soldier (Kostic) named Danijel and his female Bosniak prisoner (Marjanovic) named Ajla, and a very unsatisfying love story at that. In fact the few instances when the story turns its focus from Ajla to her sister, who has not been captured and is attempting to build a resistance against the Serbs, the film becomes far more interesting and gritty. So much so, that an argument could be made about how Ajla's sister would have made a more realistic and compelling focus for this full length feature film than Ajla herself. Furthermore, without Ajla's sister's subplot, 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' is a war film that only lightly dabbles in the brutality of war for less than a third of the movie and then it's back to the flimsy love story. In the end, Jolie attempts to address the political, brutal and cultural elements that make war so complex, but spends far, far, far too much time telling the remedial Romeo and Juliet love story between Danijel and Ajla. I am not against love stories by any means, but to have an average love story set during a fairly recent war, where genocide, rape, and political cover-ups took place, the love story aspect tends to take away (or dumb down) every other important point the film is attempting to make. This is kind of like having a hardcore love story in 'Schindler's List'. It just doesn't work.What will undoubtedly anger mass audiences the most: Because of the way Jolie structures her film, the tone inevitably does come off as one sided in the same way the aforementioned 'Schindler's List' does. Which in and of itself isn't bad, i.e. Nazi's are horrible people. But because 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' is a far less developed film, the 'all Serbian's (except for one) are inherently ruthless and cruel' mentality this film encourages, comes off as unnaturally skewed especially to those (like me) who are unfamiliar with the in-depth events of the Bosnian War. Now I am not saying that the Serbs in this film, who are shown ethnically cleansing a mass group of Muslims, were not horrible people, BUT the way this movie presents an entire race (The Serbs) as irrational and blood-thirsty, could be perceived as quite one sided. And for that reason, I can see many audiences finding this the most off-putting aspect of 'In the Land of Blood and Honey'. But then again, I am not a critic of wars.Final Thought: I will give Jolie some credit here for manufacturing some brilliant shots (mostly the war scenes) that work to show her talent behind a camera. But much as Jolie tries, it seems as if she knows more about the logistics of a love story than about creating a compelling war film. Not to say that 'In the Land of Blood and Honey' isn't a watchable effort, and does minimally redeem itself in the final two scenes of the film, BUT how this film was nominated for a Golden Globe only proves that the Hollywood Foreign Press will do anything to hang out with big stars.Please visit my page on Examiner.com http://www.examiner.com/x-52464-San-Jose-Indie-Movie-Examiner and leave any comments you have about this or any review.

Draft Day," The final 30 minutes was pretty good
","Short Review: This movie will mean nothing to anybody uninterested or unfamiliar with the NFL draft.Long Review: How does someone make a good movie out of a subject matter that is as dry and corporate as the NFL draft? I'll let you know when I see one.Going in knowing that the content would be painfully middle of the road, if only because a movie sponsored by the NFL (like any good propaganda film) must have been sifted through for any questionable or inflammatory content by every owner in the league prior to completion, the only reason I went to see this movie was because I am a fan of the NFL and thought (at the very least) it would be cool to see a football movie that used actual NFL team logos. But after about 5 minutes of that and the relentless barrage of corporate product placement, it all got old and I was forced to pay attention to the story.Synopsis: Directed by Ivan Reitman (a man who is responsible for far more stinkers than good movies; stop trying to defend him) 'Draft Day' tells the story of fictional Cleveland Browns general manager Sonny Weaver as he wrestles with what college prospect he will pick on Draft Day. Doesn't that sound like a riveting idea for a movie? Well, it is slightly more interesting than it sounds, but just slightly.Right off the bat it is revealed that Sonny is dating a woman named Ali, played by Jennifer Garner; a pairing that not only lacks any chemistry, but is visually off-putting. And aside from an ending that I must admit I thoroughly enjoyed, Dennis Leary's performance as an unapologetic caricature of Barry Switzer and Chadwick Boseman's performance as a prospect wildly undervalued by NFL scouts, it's all downhill from there. Even the direction from this seasoned filmmaker is pretty awful, full of amateurish wipes and an over abundant use of the split screen effect.Final Thought: While I was interested to see this film through, if only to find out what prospect Sonny selected, far too much of 'Draft Day' is soap opera dramatic and stiff as hell. But I guess it's not all Rietman's fault. He does manage to coax as much theatrical entertainment out of an aspect of football that doesn't include the act of playing football.",4,18,30,15 April 2014
