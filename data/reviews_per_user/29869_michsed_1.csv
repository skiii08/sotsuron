Sucker Punch," Avoid
","This has to be the worst film I have ever seen, i felt so angry at this rubbish that i registered on this site to warn people not to waste money or life on trying to watch this inception wanna be film. I can usually watch films to the end but this was enough after 5 minuets and we tried to persevere with it but only for another 15 minuets. did not make it past the awful cringe dancing scene. We thought it would be OK to watch with our 13 year old as its rated 12, what a joke, she was not impressed and felt very uncomfortable. this is such a contrived film, the outfits the names! baby doll, sweet pea, yet another naff film from Zack Snyder! please. It was so bad that i would rather watch an episode of Top Gear!",1,1,7,8 January 2012
