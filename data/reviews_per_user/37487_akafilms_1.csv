Casablanca," The greatest movie ever made
","A great filmmaker once told me there are two kinds of films. Slick and sloppy. I don't like to watch films more than once but I have seen this film 10 times and it never gets old. The dialog is sharp, the photography is great, the acting superb, the editing is right on. I'm not even a fan of B&W but this one shines. I don't know if it's because of the war (it was made in the middle of WWII) or Bogart or Claude Rains (the casting is perfect)but I cannot find anything wrong with this film. I especially like the searchlight effect that can be seen outside the windows. Peter Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet are excellent supporting cast members. The ambiance is so smooth. Even the ending (although I know it) is always wonderful. To think they shot that scene at Van Nuys airport reminds me of how magical filmmaking can be.",10,0,2,8 April 2015
