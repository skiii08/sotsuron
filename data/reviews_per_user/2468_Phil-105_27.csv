The Blair Witch Project," Lost in the jungle?
","This is a strange film.I found it okay.It seems like a good plot line.The drawback for me is the ending?I don't know why?The nights shots are so dark you can't see anything.I guess thats what they want?
                4 out of 10......",5,0,1,10 December 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The menace!!!!
","This film is a good popcorn film.The sound,effects,mood are good.The pod race was wonderful.I think people miss Han,Chewie,etc,.The orignal was flawed as well.I feel Phantom is a better film than jedi.Han was flat in Jedi.Lando as well.Luke was great in jedi.I feel that there was a tad bit to much of Jar Jar Binks.He is a ham folks.Children will love him.Darth Maul is a bully.He is so strong two Jedi must destroy him.The battle droids are a bunch of clowns.Then again,The stormtroopers weren't any better with a blaster.I sincerely believe the next two film will have the final impact on this film.Remember, there is two more to see.",8,0,0,25 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The start of something fresh and new in scifi.
","We are now six months past the opening of the film.It still rises forces of pro and con for it.This is my humble two cents on the Tpm.The tpm is STAR WARS.This is plain and simple.The story starts 30 years before ep4.The galaxy is more peaceful and slow paced.The plot revolves around the trade federation and Naboo.Darth Sidious is the MAIN villian.He is menace I think.The film does bring forth many new charcters and ideas.We have been so used to knowing what was going to happen in the orginal film for years.I am glad not to know what comes next.I feel the charcters of Obi,Mace Windu,Amidala will be rembered fondly.Further,Lucas deserves credit for making the film.The other films will round out the tpm.Till they are completed give the film some slack.The main trouble I see in the film are few and minor.Binks could have had less time on screen.Pod race could have 2 minutes shaved off it.Darth Maul ten more minutes in screen time.The dialogue could have been a little better.
7 out of 10 for the phantom menace.",8,0,0,20 November 1999
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," The end?
","ROTJ is a well done movie.The music,effects,sound are good.The trouble is Han.Han is still in carbonite mentally.I liked him in the first two.He seemed bored in it.Ford wanted him to die.Vader is good.The ewoks are okay.They are teddy bears.The se is a little better than  the orginal film.I give it 6 out of ten.",Null,0,1,6 June 1999
Alien," A epic materpiece of horror scifi
",I rented this film last week.I hadn't seen it in about ten years.The effects and suspence are great.The charcters are real people not cutouts like in its inferior sequels.The film is more horror than anything else.I was surprised at how good the effects were for 1979.Ripley is the first female action hero. The director does a good job with his angles.There are some strange shots though. 11 out of 10.A rating for all the film.,10,0,1,11 March 2000
The Thing," Spooky.
",The film is truly a masterpiece.The critics are way off in the reviews for 14 years.They don't see the real story.The isolation is the story.You have no where to run or hide.Each team member turns on each other on a drop of a dime.The effects are great.Who is the thing ??? Kurt Russell does a great job in the film......,9,0,1,20 June 1999
The Thing," Horror in the snow.
",This movie scared the living daylights out of me.I think it is one of Carpenter best films.The effects are scary as heck.The movie has an underlying sense of tension.Just who has been infected and by whom?Kurt Russell gives a good performance in the flick.Music and sound work well.I think the film tries to show the dark side of humanity.The part of the blood testing is one of the most disturbing in film history.I can't wait to watch it on dvd.,9,0,1,9 November 1998
The Thing," Who are what is really the thing?????????????
","The film is truly a masterpiece of its genre.The setting,music,mood work to perfection.The characters seem slowly driven mad as one after another die or become the thing.People complain about character development in the film.This is not War AND Peace.The bareness of life surrounding the camp is amazing.Possible spoiler maybe is coming up????The blood test in the rec room is the most harrowing 10 mins you will ever see in film .The critics and audieces of 1982 were not ready for the film.I was a teen at the time and remember Siskel God rest his soul blasting the film all over the media.Ebert liked it and defended it.Again, The thing will one day get its true rating in horror films.I bought the widescreen version and will stick with it for now.",9,0,1,21 May 2000
Apocalypse Now," The horror.
",This film is a cinematic masterpiece. The war is as crazy as the world around it. The film is DEEP. I repeat it is DEEP. The role that Martin Sheen plays is wonderful.When he says 'When I was here I wanted to be there'.'When I was there I wanted to be here.' This shows the viewer how nam has become this man's life.The film has a lot of background plots as well. Duvall is wonderful as that crazy man in the helicoptor. He is a film in his own way. The movie seems like it was shot as it happened. I wonder if it is Really FICTION????????????????????,9,0,0,26 February 1999
Aliens," Please watch the directors cut SE today.
",I purchased the directors cut today.I find the added clips to make the movie 10 times better.It really fills in some of the void between alien attacks.This film is a true scifi classic.Ripely is a wonderful strong female lead action hero.The first in scfi history.The cast works well toghter.Watch SE aliens today......................,Null,0,0,22 February 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Classic.
",This movie is a splendor.The opening battle scene will be remembered as the greatest opening shots in movie history.Tom Hanks gives his best performance of his life.In Saving Private Ryan all things are relative.The film makes you think a DANGEROUS CONCEPT  not found often on the screen? No waterboys needed here thank you.The film leaves you with a feeling of being there in WW2.Platoon is the second most realistic war film,10,0,0,18 December 1998
Saving Private Ryan," A masterpiece.
",This film is truely a masterpiece.  No film in history has made war so real. Hanks gives his best performance to date.  He is the man of the movie.  The film seems real at times.  The actors are first rate.  10 out of 10.,10,0,0,21 March 2000
Patton," A masterpiece of film.
",This film is one of the greatest WW2 films ever made.Patton is awesome in the showing of the man.Patton was played to perfection by George C.Scott.The film shows us the man as he was.His slapping of the soldier is powerful.The music score is awesome as well.,10,1,6,5 June 1999
Jaws," Jawed!!!!
","The film is a complete masterpiece.The film is so pysch.The horror is in your mind.You know Jaws is out there beyond the seagulls.The kitner boy doesn't.The attack on the swimmers is brutal to watch.The little boy always bothers me to this day.Shaw gives the greatest performance of his life.HE IS QUINT.The keys remain three things:the music,camera work,Quint. Jaws is multilayered in many ways.The corrupt MAYOR'In the town best interest mode'.He sells out the visitors for a buck.He should go take a swim ???",10,2,4,14 May 1999
Jaws," Just when you thought?
","I watched this masterpiece the other night.It still puts a chill in your spine.Spielberg direction here is great.His direction is truely wonderful.For example,The setup of the shark on the little boy.You know its him before he goes onto the water.Several false scares occur.Brody is like a man waiting for it to happen.The shot of the camera zooming him is priceless.Shaw steals the film with far less screen time.He overpowers the other 2 on the boat acting wise.Hollywood will never in a billion years duplicate this film.All the sequels and copys treat as the garbage they are.AVOID JAW3 AND JAWS4 AT ALL COSTS.I truely wished they left it alone at Jaws2.",10,1,2,23 June 2000
Platoon," The first lie is worse than the last.
","I once was a big fan of this film. I give it a lot of praise for its technical accurate showing of life in the Nam. There has been much criticism of Oliver for the village scence.The commander of the 25infy division says it NEVER HAPPENED. The same goes for the drugs and other lies. In the time Oliver was serving,Amercia was still behind the war and the troops were not out of control zombies. I am ashamed of his village scene.I was not in Nam, so I have no story to tell.The film Platoon must be viewed in this context. It is part fiction and part non fiction. Do your research and don't always listen to Oliver and his lies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,0,31 March 1999
Platoon," WAR IS HELL
","Platoon is  a masterpiece.Stone captures the Nam from the grunts point of view.NO Rambo here.The jungle is full of death and fear.Sheen gives his best performance of his life.Dafoe and Ber add alot of grit to.For example,As Sheen struggles in a march,Barnes shows no understanding to him.GET A MOVE ON BOY HE SHOUTS.Dafoe takes a caring love to him.Further,there are a few negatives which I see more clearly now than 10 years ago in the film.Most of the platoon are not nice men.They kill innocent people  with no remorse.Bunny is a section 8 in any other war.I have heard commanders of the time say drug use and hazing of civilians was not tolerated in the early years.Platoon takes place early in the war.I feel Stone added these lies to make a better movie.I knew these things did go on in the Nam.I  question if Stone really saw these things?????????????????I give the film 8 out of 10/",10,2,5,7 January 2001
Halloween," The night HE came HOME!!!
",This film is a classic.The story and music are top notch.You are actually afraid.The sequels should all be burned to a crisp.I wish they would have just left it ALONE!!!The sequels were sad.This business of Jamie as his sister was absurd!!I think the first film was good because you didn't know why he was doing the murders.Watch the widescreen version it a lot better the pan and scan.,9,1,2,14 April 1999
Paths of Glory," War is hell or is it something else??
","I  found this film very touching.The ww1 film is much different than garbage we have today.The general sells his own men out for a pay raise.The generals treatment of men is shameful.I couldn't believe they were executing the men for no reason.Kirk Douglas is wonderful.There is sense of sadness in this movie that runs deep.Let the politicians watch it before the next war.A must see film....
8 out 10",Null,0,0,22 July 1999
Any Given Sunday," Go get em!!!!!!!
","This film is a masterfilm.Stone shows all the glory and evil of the game.Al Pacino gives a wonderful performance.He shows how the coachs of yesterday thought.Today players play for the big check and don't give a darn about the team,world,etc.Thats what wrong with sports.The money,greed,tv,drugs,media,fans.This film shows all of them coming toghter.Coach D'Amato finds the right stuff for himself and the team in his heart.Glad to see Stone give the conspiracies a break.This is his best film since Platoon......The camera angles are strange to say the least.

Blade Runner," Rain drops keep falling on my head.
",WOW! This film has impressive visuals and effects.Hard to believe they made it for 28 million.The story is about a blade runner who must hunt down replicants who reach earth.Ford plays the blade runner to perfection.There is alot going on in some shots.Rutger gives a great performance.Much has been written and debated about the film for years?Spoilers??? The debate on whether the blade runner is a replicant or human?I am unsure on it.I feel they wanted you to question that.Replicants are not allowed on earth for a fact.The rain snd shadows seem spooky.Apartments and rooms are dark in shadowey. A scfi classic in its own right.,9,0,0,5 June 2000
The Matrix," WOW!
","I have never seen a movie quite like this.The plot is so seemlessly interwoven to itself.What is the matrix?You must see for yourself.Neo is the man of mystery in the movie.He learns that he must destroy the matrix and it lies.I think some people are confused by the plot.It is confusing.No one knows how or why the AI took over.I love the Effects and Sound.Lawerence plays the part better than any man alive can.The matrix is REFRESHING.Its not SW,Star Trek,Aliens,ETC.It is a stand alone world.Hollywood take heed from this movie.Further,Agent Smith steals every minute he is on.THE classic goverment spook plays to perfection.I can't wait to have a dvd player.In summary,The matrix now has a following similar to SW.I never get tired of watching it.Sw is the same thing for me.WO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,0,19 March 2000
The Matrix," Neo means new folks......
","I have not been so over joyed to watch a film like this in ages.It takes you in a never lets go.The whole film seems like being trapped in a video game.There is no blood in the shoot outs.Thats because nothing going on is real.......The agents are awesome as they defend the matrix.The guns and the lady in leather are awesome.I most say this was better than the the phantom menace.I say it with true veal.I am one big sw fan and wanted a little more from tpm.Where Lucas failed on 5/19/99 the matrix rocked...................You need not only great,visuals,music,actors,sound plot,mood,directors,script to have a classic.EACH MUST FLOW THROUGH THE OTHER.The matrix is the greatest scifi film in twenty years period.Two more films follow.I hope they show how the made guys operate and if the police are computer simulations or other people locked in the matrix.................",10,0,0,23 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Use the force Luke!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","The film is a classic.The film is much more about truth and love than anything else..The secret is you care about Han,Luke,Obi,Liea.YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT THE PEOPLE in the films of alien,star trek,etc. They have no panish for life.Han is an enigma.He says 'the hell with everyone often' but loves Luke and the princess more than anything else.The film will always have a fun feeling to it.Thank God for this film.It never GETS OLD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",10,0,0,16 February 1999
The Thin Red Line," War is hell.
","I found the TTRL to be a okay film.The jungle and shots are filmed wonderfully.The film does dwell on nature alot.I believe it is to show how war affects everything and everyone around it.The acting was okay.Further,There seems to be to many stars put in for no reason.Cloony,Trav,Har,etc.They add little to the story.I found Penn and Noltle to be wonderful.What happens to Col Noltle though????He is left out of the last 20 min.You may have to see it a few times to get its full meaning.

Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," The empire is on a rampage folks!!!!!!!!!!!
","This is the strongest film of the three.The story is much more well developed then the first film.The charcters are fleshed out more.Luke,Han,Leia Chewie must face the wrath of Vader.The film is the best of the orginal three.Music,effects,sound are topnotch.The only drawback is I wish there was more of Fett.I think Lucas does this on purpose.He gives us villians like Fett,Maul,Vader and lets are imagination fill in the blanks.I think Maul would take Vader any day.               EPSB 9 out of ten.",Null,0,0,28 November 1999
Braveheart," A masterpiece of filmmaking.
","This film is what true film making is all about.Mel Gibson gives a wonderful performance as Wallace.Wallace character is the whole film.He fights for FREEDOM.He is more noble than all the nobles in Scotland.The fighting episodes are highly graphic.Children should be over mature age to match.The film never glorifes violence as most hollywood trash does.Further,The mood,music,countryside are wonderful to observe.Mel is at his finest in this role.This is a refreshing change from the joke flicks LW-1-4.",Null,0,1,7 September 1999
