The Blair Witch Project," The worst movie I have seen this year!
","This movie was not smart, scary, or even cleverly done.  It is nothing more than a botched doc. film done in very poor taste.  The film was surrounded by prop and was blown up by advertising as well as the tv presentation of 'Curse of the Blair Witch'.  A very, very, sad and pathetic attempt to 'scare' people.",1,1,3,18 December 1999
Sleepy Hollow," Good film, see it on the big screen
","Good Movie!  It did not make the all too common error of attempting to be ULTRA serious.  I recommend seeing it on the big screen.  The plot development was satisfactory, but the character development could have used some work.",7,0,0,18 December 1999
