Spartacus," Worth it just for Peter Ustinov
","I have just finished watching Spartacus on my modest home cinema system and can say that I enjoyed it despite its many flaws. I will consider these now: The film is terribly dated and very kitsch. The score is triumphant and overbearing or soppy and annoying, some outdoor sets are obviously fake, and I did not have a great deal of liking for Spartacus' girlfriend nor even for Spartacus himself. Cruel as they are, I prefer the evil Romans - much more to my taste. Tony Curtis is very camp in this film, and it's obvious that this is a late fifties film in terms of design choices (released in 1960). The acting is quite hammy overall but that is quite fitting for a production of this kind and of that time. Caesar in the film is not at all convincing as Caesar the great tyrant-in-waiting; he is played in far too a good boyish way.As a classicist, I am able to say that there is very little factual truth in this film - Crassus was extremely rich, yes, but never became dictator and in many senses was not as much of a heavyweight as is made out in the film. The Gracchus character is an anachronism as he died years before Spartacus and Crassus and never had power in the senate. The slave revolt led by Spartacus was never aimed at ending slavery - they wanted the rights of citizens and perhaps would have gone on to own their very own slaves. I do not believe it was their intention, as in the film, to go 'home' as, for all intents and purposes, Italy was their home. I realise this film was based on a novel and not on history books but it's interesting sometimes to see the liberties historical films can take for the sake of entertainment.Now the good points. For obvious reasons, I was very sensitive to how the film-makers captured Rome, physically and spiritually and some of the set pieces were stunning although perhaps not accurate. My favourite scene, however, has to be the plain scene with the legions marching in formation. I was glued to the screen. But, saving the best for last, Peter Ustinov as Spartacus' owner was just wonderful - funny and incredibly good to watch. He deserved the Oscar he won for this part. I enjoyed watching the legendary Lawrence Olivier and I really liked his style but he is very much of an Ac-tor. Still I found he had the right combination of haughtiness, presence and, dare I say it, vulnerability. I also think the story half-manages to bring a slightly epic feel to the film.It's odd because the negatives seem to outweigh the positives but I really enjoyed this film for sheer entertainment that is not instant and fast like so much modern pap.8 out of 10.",8,0,2,19 January 2012
Spider-Man," Spider-Man Hits Hollywood
","I think this is a good movie that has stood the test of time. It is both the best and worst Hollywood can offer. Great action sequences, good easy to follow story, good acting, good effects, good costumes, a certain amount of (pinko liberal) social commentary but also a great deal of soft sentimentality which makes me glad for a satirical show like South Park, although I do not claim to be impervious to the sentimentality as even after watching the movie several times, I am still stirred by it, almost despite myself.Most importantly, Spider-Man the movie does the comic book justice. It lacks the gritty humour of the comic strip and yes, Tobey Maguire lacks the intellectual/spiritual maturity of the comic book Peter Parker, not to mention his wit and likability as a guy, but, to my mind, he does a good job for the most. My favourite performance in the film is that of James Franco - I think he really shines in this film.The film has its clich√©s but they are not jarring - for example, the military giant Oscorp creating a super-villain in the form of the Green Goblin (unlike the star review, I think his costume is awesome, and so is Spidey's), corporate power struggles, some script that is a little iffy (but hey that is what you get in comic books and I personally like its simplicity and lack of pretentiousness), boy becoming adult, woman (Mary Jane) as spur for manly self-overcoming (Peter Parker) etc.At the risk of sounding too intellectual, I think the film shines in its caricatured portrayal of America and New York in particular, where you get a sense of the diversity of individuals (for example when different people utter their views on the new super-hero in town), the difficulties of making a living and holding down a job and the difficult process of starting out in life (developed further in the excellent sequel) (made even more difficult by the bullying tactics of self-glorifying entrepreneur/petty capitalist Jona Jameson and chef Enrique (Mary Jane's employer))...There is a strong Christian ethos that permeates the film's (moral) philosophy. This last thread is personified in the film by the character of Ben Parker who coins the phrase 'with great power comes great responsibility', easily transferable to America's role as world superpower, several references to the Bible, the Lord's Prayer, a Christian church in the background: in short good versus evil. (In Spider-Man 3, true to the comic book, Spider-Man's evil symbiotic costume is got rid of in a Christian church - a very transparent metaphor).On the evil side, of course, we have goblin, and Defoe who I think is really good as the mentally ill villain. Osborn Senior's collection of masks points to a primal awareness of the power of disguise and warrior gear (developed interestingly in Batman Begins 'To overcome fear, you must become fear', i.e. Batman and the notion of the symbol), all or nothing, psychotic and cynical thinking that is characteristic of our view of 'evil' as well as this idea that the masses are made, in Osborn's words, to drive the few to become exceptional and be carried on the teeming masses' shoulders.Two scenes in this film I find graphically exceptional: the scene in the burning building where Spidey confronts Goblin for the second or third time, and the final confrontation in the graveyard, which I find visually stunning and violently dark in an effective way.On an aesthetic level then, this film largely succeeds. The lighting is 'comic bookie' but not jarring (except in some sequences in Times Square), there are brilliant and subtle transition graphics such as when an explosion blends into graduate hats being thrown in the air or when Peter Parker is designing his costume and there is quite a lot of caricatured yet quite accurate representation of crowd mentality such as the one watching gladiatorial combat in the form of the wrestling contest.To conclude this review, I would say that this feature film has quite a bit of meat to it, if one is prepared to pay attention, and, like the best of comic books, has a good deal of reality seeping into it, despite appearances.Eight out of ten.",8,1,2,24 June 2011
Gran Torino," Competent but ultimately unedifying
","I give this movie a 5 star rating and my reasons are as follows. The cinematography is stunning, much like Clint's Mystic River and Unforgiven. I found the portrayal of gang culture - although this is not the main focus of the film - quite convincing including the gang members' patent violations of Natural Law. I particularly enjoyed how peer pressure was shown in the film - as when Taoh's cousin encourages him to join his gang - and I found the scene where Sue and boyfriend are accosted by nefarious black youths particularly well done. Unlike other reviewers, the high point for me in the acting department was Sue, Taoh's sister. I found her acting contribution the most memorable of the entire cast, including Clint's. Taoh himself, although I initially liked him as a thoughtful, quiet, bookish boy, abused by family and strangers alike, annoyed me as he learnt to 'speak and act like a man' under Walter's influence.I have to admit part of the reason my score has gone down a few notches is due to my distaste for macho culture, as evidenced in the barber and construction site scenes, where Clint teaches the ever irritating and gullible Taoh (he's a kid to be fair) how to be one of those 'hard working', rude, sexist, racist money slaves that never think critically for one second or open a book in a lifetime. Call me butthurt if you like, but being creative and sensitive myself, I find the whole man's paradigm (including having tools and being good at carpentry and practical crap like that) presented glibly in the film quite unpalatable. But ultimately what prevents me from giving this film a higher score is its lack of sophistication, resorting to stereotyping, sentimentality and shock value to drive its points home as opposed to transcending thoughtlessness and expanding consciousness about our world, a thing which I concede is rarely achieved in film. Some examples of this are Oliver Stone's Wall Street, John Carpenter's They Live, Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut.So if you're looking for a thoughtful, meaningful, truthful romp this is not it, but the film is nevertheless watchable (despite poor acting from some of the cast as has been mentioned in other reviews) and I enjoyed it enough to watch till the end.",5,2,4,12 March 2016
The Dark Knight," Epic
","It took me three viewings to fully appreciate the masterliness of The Dark Knight. On first viewing I found it too long and the plot impossible to follow (but that's me being slow); on second viewing I got the gist of the game and liked the film a whole lot more. On my third viewing (I own the title on Blu-Ray) I was astounded by the quality of (1) the dialogue, (2) the mood, (3) the acting, (4) the subtlety and efficiency of the scene cutting, (5) the photography (especially noteworthy are the aerial shots) and (6) the plot. And, yes, the special effects are phenomenal. Oh and the score is both compelling and threatening, as is fitting for a Batman movie. For me, the star of the film is not so much Heath Ledger, though he is very good as the Joker, but Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent. His lines are my favourite and he has so much charisma and charm... Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel is a definite improvement on Katie Holmes for a number of reasons. The relationship between Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) and Alfred (Michael Caine) is very convincing and Mr Fox (Morgan Freeman) is, as usual, impeccable. My only serious gripe with the film, despite the painstaking effort at realism on the part of Christopher Nolan, is the rather high number, perhaps inevitably, of implausibilities. Granted though, this is a comic book-based film and so it gets away with it. In summary, this film is well worth the effort and must feature among one of the best crime-fighting films of all time (for me the best of the genre is still Heat by Michael Mann).",9,1,4,17 December 2009
Whiplash," Shallow and Perverse
","This is a shallow and perverse movie. The characters are paper thin, lacking both humanity and spirit, which of itself would guarantee their being useless musicians, let alone jazz musicians, one of the most spontaneous, warm and free spirited of all musical genres (contrary to how the film portrays it as being all about razor sharp precision).This film must appeal to non musicians who think that corporate fascism and bullying techniques of fear based mind control apply to making good music, not just turning people into corporate slave workers. Well they're wrong. What's disturbing is that the film pulls no punches as to the abuse of the Nazi in all but name played by J.K. Simmons (in what has to be a vastly overrated performance, not helped by a very weak script) yet the moral seems to be that bullying and instilling fear in people brings out the best in them.Well that is a false message if ever there was one. Moreover, the characters, both 'teacher' and 'student' as well as the side musicians are totally cold and uninspiring and New York feels like a depressed ghetto. Andrew's family dinner scene is very revealing of the sad, conformist, death-like mindset of some people ensconced in the social control system without an iota of imagination, creativity or spirit. This movie is depressing. It shows very well what is wrong with the world (namely, power abuse) without any attempt at critiquing it artistically. Instead, the film justifies and promotes it, all in the name of 'art' (what cheek!). That pathetic critics and movie goers rate this film so highly just pinpoints how tasteless and morally challenged the vast majority of the population actually are. And I agree with another reviewer that it is sad to see all these music students start to hate on each other just to be on Fletcher's good cards - just how power works in real life. Stand up for yourselves you cowardly losers!As I said, this film is shallow and perverse. People who like this movie must have no experience of suffering at the hands of people in positions of power. Nor can they possibly have the slightest understanding of what learning to play an instrument well entails. Their primitive minds are probably still trapped in the clich√© that military 'discipline' (or rather psychological rape) is the way to treat people and 'get the most out of them'.Pathetic.One star.",1,8,16,18 March 2016
