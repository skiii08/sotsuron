Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Worst Movie ever
","There is a theory around stating that it is not violent movies which make viewers aggressive but bad ones. After watching this piece of s**t at the cinema, even PAYING for it, I can tell you this theory has some merit. At least I definitely wanted to skin some cute furry little animals alive after watching this masterpiece. And this is the only movie so far that has done this to me, at least to this extent. I just hope the b******s who gave us the Ewoks and Jar-Jar Binks will go and take a running jump. Sorry if I got carried away, but this is what that movie will do to you. If I had seen any chance of succeeding, I would have filed a lawsuit to get my money back (and maybe something on top for all the pain and anguish it caused me watching it). What a far cry from the first two Star Wars flicks.",1,2,5,2 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Enjoyable B-Movie
","While Episode I left me in a complete rage, mostly due to the appearance of a rather long-eared and EXTREMELY obnoxious character, whose name I shall never utter again, I actually quite enjoyed this movie. Even though probably not for the reasons intended by it's makers. Maybe it also helped that I watched this one under influence of a few beers at a University theater, surrounded by hundreds of others who would laugh and cheer with me at the often ridiculous story and perhaps not top-notch acting. Be sure that the setting in which you are watching this movie is right (friends, beer), and you may well be rewarded with quite a few laughs. Just don't watch it alone or expect that you will see anything in a league with the original movies and you will be quite happy. Of course, this is just my humble opinion and if you are under 12 years of age, you will probably really like it anyway, until you grow and accumulate more experience (which is when you might probably wish that something really nasty would have happened to George Lucas before he could commit the Ewoks crime. Not that I would ever do that).",5,0,1,5 September 2005
The Fast and the Furious," Oh dear
","Um, right. What can I say about this one? Well, it certainly made Vin Diesel stand out as an actor (if only because everybody else was utterly worthless). I did not even bother to watch it to the (certainly highly dramatic) finale because I got bored s###less. Not much else to say, but whoever participated in that movie (in whatever position - from director to the last extra - except of course for Vin, who shines out in this like a shaft of gold when all around is dark) should under no circumstances quit their day jobs. Laughable plot, incredibly bad acting... well, maybe, just maybe it has got all the right stuff for a c-movie classic. By the way, I am in no way a Vin Diesel fan, it is just the even worse acting of everybody else that makes him shine that much in this piece of 'movie'.",1,3,8,2 August 2005
Stalingrad," Kind of disappointed
","While certainly the movie had quite a lot of promise, I have to say that I was a tad bit disappointed by the plot. The entire movie just seems to consist of cobbled-together pieces from the book 'Enemy at the Gates' by William Craig. While the later picture of that title concentrated on just one episode of the book, this movie tries to cram it ALL in. Basically every scene is taken from the book and as I had read it prior to watching the film, I was quite disappointed. There certainly was enough tragedy in this, one of the bloodiest battles of WW2, without having to try to make the protagonists live through EVERY single publicised part of it. To me, it was simply overkill. Perhaps if I had not known the book beforehand (I have a copy of the original, not the reedition for the Jude Law flic and read it before seeing either film), I would have appreciated the movie more. Concentrating on one facet of the struggle (as the later 'Enemy at the Gates' did) might have made me feel more for the characters instead of thinking 'hey, I know this from somewhere' all the time as I actually did with this one, unfortunately. To me, 'Die Bruecke' and 'Das Boot' still rank supreme, as far as German efforts to portray the Second World War are concerned. Those movies actually made me feel for the characters and wish that a situation such as they were in would never occur again.",6,2,7,5 September 2005
