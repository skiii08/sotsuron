The Blair Witch Project," Nothing happens.
","Well, it's a different kind of film.
You could rate it in three parts.
The first third of the film is pretty amazeballs, because nothing really happens.
Then the middle part, oh boy, there's nothing really happening. What a twist!
And finally...I mean third, nothing happened.
Oh and the shaking camera is also extremely necessary and it doesn't make your head hurt at all.",1,1,5,29 July 2019
