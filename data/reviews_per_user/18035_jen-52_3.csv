The New World," another yawnathon starring Colin Farrell
","As if Alexander wasn't enough, Colin Farrell embarks on yet another trip to tedium. No spoilers in this review, because nothing actually happens, unless you count shots of trees and rivers, and the un-named girl prancing around in the grass as action. This was a whole load of nothing dressed up in some decent cinematography to make it look 'artistic'. All the action in this film takes place in the trailer. The characters are not well enough developed to have any empathy with, and I was left writhing with boredom until I persuaded the person I was with to leave.At least Colin Farrell had the sense to stay away from the hairdressers this time :)",1,1,5,13 March 2006
Pearl Harbor," One huge bomb
","Think of every possible disaster/action movie cliche. One character was abused as a child. Dreams really can come true. There's always a dog that survives the disaster (Independence Day, Dante's Peak etc). Prejudiced person won over. Tragic death scene. Tokenism and stereotypes. I could go on. Well, they're all in here. There aren't enough words to describe this too-expensive farce so I'll be brief. PATHETIC. A big fat zero from me. The only thought it provoked was how on earth it ever got made.",Null,0,0,25 August 2001
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," The Emperor's New Clothes
","The more films Tarantino makes, the more obvious the truth is...while he undeniably has style, there's just no substance. 'The Bride seeks revenge'...well, that's it. And knowing from the off that she had already killed O-Ren made the subsequent hour an exercise in tedium and there's only so much ludicrous cartoon violence instead of story one can take without just falling asleep. It's all been done before. And not having seen the second part and frankly, after this, without even a shred of curiosity to do so, I imagine the plot synopsis to that will be 'The Bride gets her Revenge'. This film was just plain BORING, the only good thing about it was that at least Tarantino stayed BEHIND the camera.",1,6,12,12 August 2004
