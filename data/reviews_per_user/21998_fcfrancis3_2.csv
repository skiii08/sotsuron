Casablanca," Timeless
","Regardless of when the first time you saw Casablanca was, the movie will always remain timeless.  Boggie plays the sarcastic and charismatic Rick Blaine and the beautiful Ingrid Bergman plays the lovely Ilsa, the only woman Rick ever loved who comes back into his life after abruptly leaving him.  'Of all the gin joints in all the cities in all the world, she comes walking into mine.'The ultimate tale of love and sacrifice, Casablanca is a movie that despite how much times change, this film never loses its magic. 
From a personal standpoint, I am not that big a fan of older movies (what some people dub 'classics'.  I generally don't like any film made before 1960.  I find the acting generally cheesy.  But along with On The Waterfront, Casablanca is still one of the most amazing movies ever made. Highly recommended.  Don't go to the video store and rent it, just go buy it.",10,3,3,8 August 2003
The Dark Knight," Would Win Best Picture if it Wasn't Based on A Comic Book
","Best Batman movie ever.Best film of 2008 thus far.The Dark Knight is amazing film-making. While Heath Ledger's turn as the Joker is what is getting all the hype (trust me, the hype is more than well deserved), there isn't a bad performance in this film. Michael Caine & Morgan Freeman are brilliant as always...they make it look easy. Aaron Eckhart was a better Harvey Dent/Two-Face than Tommy Lee Jones. Casting Maggie Gylennhall to replace Katie Holmes was a wise choice (why she wasn't chosen initially is beyond me, she is a much better choice than Mrs. Cruise).Christian Bale is Batman. No other way to describe him. He is the only one who has captured every essence of that character.What bothers me is that this film is so good, but since it is based of a Comic Book it will most likely get no recognition other than breaking some box office records. While there is talk of Ledger getting a posthumous Best Supporting Actor nod, Nolan's directing, the screenplay, the special FX, and the film itself should also be recognized. I would put this movie up there with great crime dramas like 'Heat'.Believe the hype, the Dark Knight is amazing.",10,4,10,20 July 2008
