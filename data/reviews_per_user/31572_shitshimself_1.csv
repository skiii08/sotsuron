Hereditary," Solid Occult Horror
","This is a slow burn of a movie, but you will be greatly rewarded along the way to a nerve racking ending for your patience. Basically the story is about a modern family with some issues that has a grandmother pass away witch sets in motion a series of tragic events that begin to unravel the family's dark ancestry. This a thinking man's horror even though the story's foundation sits firmly on a simple horror story. The acting is solid with fresh, realistic dialog and logical actions/reactions. The photography is as stunning as well. Heavy use of symbolism and metaphors abound. giving this film several layers to the dark, tragic and foreboding atmosphere. Even the few usual jump scares are down played to give them a creepy,, longer lasting sense of dread instead of just a big boo. Jump scares aside, there are several scenes that will give even the most jaded of horror film watchers a good jolt and disturb long after the film is over. If you can force yourself to remain patient and keep away from out outside interruptions you will be entertained through out the film's running time. Cannot wait to see what the director's next effort is going to be.",4,1,2,22 August 2018
