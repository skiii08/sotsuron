The Lobster," An absurdist black comedy about society's obsessive mating rituals.
","To appreciate a film like The Lobster (2015) you need to know something about absurdism and dystopia. Whether we recognise it or not, our brains are wired into binary sets that help us make sense of the world. For example: in fictional narrative we tell stories about being unloved in order to express our need for love; we portray the fearful 'them' in order for 'us' to feel safe; and we explore the depths of 'evil' to celebrate what is 'good'. Absurdist films take these inversions of logic to their extreme in order to make us question the world we take for granted. They often add black comedy and dystopian/chaotic themes as a way of messing with our minds and challenging the foundations of our reality.If you are still reading this, you will recognise The Lobster as an absurdist dystopian essay. It is a story set in a place referred to as The City where coupledom is compulsory and being single is illegal. If anyone becomes un-coupled they are immediately incarcerated in The Hotel where they have 45 days to re-couple or they will be transformed into an animal of their choice. Most of the unnamed people we meet are referred to by a defining characteristic, except for our protagonist, recently widowed architect David (Colin Farrell). The inmates must participate in dancing to bland music and attend lectures about the evils of being single. They are only allowed to leave the hotel to join hunts in the forest. If they shoot escaped loners they earn extra time before being turned into an animal.In this rule-bound parallel universe everyone wears the same clothes and everything is hyper- regulated. When rules are broken punishment is severe: one victim has his fingers jammed into a burning toaster at breakfast for everyone to see. The forest world is the opposite to the The City. Escaped loners enjoy cool music and dance, but must stay single and any physical contact is forbidden. As his time runs out in The Hotel, David fears that he will fail to couple and flees to join the loners. As fate would have it, he meets his love amongst them and must sneak back into city life.What to make of this strange tale? Despite its all-star cast, conventional acting criteria seem irrelevant as performances are understated and almost expressionless. The filming palette in The Hotel is blandly desaturated while that for the forest is richly foreboding, making both feel unwelcome. There are no flashbacks or other cinematic devices that offer insight into why things are the way we see them. We are left then with the classic absurdist challenge: to find meaning in this film you must turn logic on its head.If you reflect on how much of our lives are focused on preparation for love and marriage, and how much real-world capitalist consumption is obsessed with beauty, sex appeal, and appearances, the absurd inverted metaphors of The Lobster begin to make sense. The City is not that different to romance TV reality shows where contestants hunt for mates based on defining characteristics. The real question is why are loners ostracised and why is there such pressure on finding partners? In the real world, I mean.",8,1,1,18 February 2017
10 Cloverfield Lane," The ending transforms this film into an incoherent and unforgivable mess.
","Many movie lovers will leave this film with a dilemma swirling in their mind: can a poorly conceived and poorly directed ending be ignored while you hang on to the memory of the brilliant film that almost was? In cinema, the answer is usually no because we remember a film backwards via the way the story ended. The ending is also the key to how we read a film and how we apply genre codes to make sense of cinematic storytelling. This film traverses three totally different but often compatible genres: the psychological thriller, the horror/gore, and the science fantasy, in that order. Note that the last one is not the same as science fiction, a respectable genre that creatively draws on the logic of science. The film 10 Cloverfield Lane (2016) starts brilliantly as a thriller, drops a gear or two as horror, and then has an inexcusable brain-snap as mediocre science fantasy.The linear plot line opens with soon-to-be-married Michelle (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) walking out on her fiancé only to drive straight into a horrific car crash. She wakes chained inside a bunker and is held captive by Howard (John Goodman), a doomsday prophet who built the sealed underground structure in anticipation of a major global event. He eventually convinces her that the outside world is now a post-apocalyptic and uninhabitable mess. His neighbour Emmett (John Gallagher) is the only other actor and becomes a confidante for Michelle, but not for long. For the first three- quarters of the film, tension builds then flattens while Michelle becomes accepting of her plight in a claustrophobic space that has all the comforts of home. When Howard's temper shifts into horror and gore mode, Michelle takes flight only to stumble into a B-grade science fantasy created with last century computer graphics. Everything this film achieves in terms of emotional tension, doubt, confusion, and of course, unbridled feargoes up in a puff a smoke.John Goodman's imposing girth, menacing bluster and steely gaze entertainingly convey total terror with enough glimpses of 'Mr nice-guy' to create confusion. For the most part Mary Elizabeth Winstead ably reflects vulnerability, disbelief and fear, although she settles into domesticity rather too easily. The early unfolding story sustains a level of plausibility, even when Howard starts going weird. The real thrill in this film, however, is watching it crash and burn in the last twenty minutes as it runs out of ideas and takes a bad turn in the hope that the applause of science fantasy fans will drown out the boos of thriller fans. But neither group wins as the ending transforms this film into an incoherent and unforgivable mess.",4,22,34,16 March 2016
Deepwater Horizon," as spectacular a dramatization of an oil-rig explosion that digital effects allow
","The moral of most man-made disaster films is that when civilisation disrespects nature the results can be catastrophic. Such films work best when we get both sides of the story: the why and what happened on humanity's side, and nature's response and effects on the other. It is clear that big money was involved in the 2010 oil-rig disaster that is examined in Deepwater Horizon (2016). In fact, there is so much at stake that the most significant part is left out of the film: the immediate and long term effects of the worst ecological disaster in American history.Instead of the full story, the film offers as spectacular a dramatization of an oil-rig explosion that digital effects allow. The one-day plot line is simple and tight. It starts with a human interest back story of Mike Williams (Mark Wahlberg) having time off as boss of the Deepwater Horizon oil-rig, and his home life is sweet. Kissing wife and daughter goodbye, he heads off for a 21-day rig shift and on the helicopter ride we meet the British Petroleum bad guy executives. Tension lines are drawn immediately between Mike's safety maintenance role and the 'hurry up and make more money' pressure from the company.A great strength of this film is its ability to convey the dirty, claustrophobic and technology- dependent world of offshore oil-drilling. It is full of whiteboard diagram explanations, fear-inducing instrument dials with pointers drifting into red zones and grim-faced technicians who sense something calamitous is near. It also shows a grimy environment in which humans strip non- renewable resources from deep in our planet, all for profit. When poor safety and maintenance practices lead to the massive blowout and explosion, the film is at its best in portraying a veritable Dante's Inferno on water. Hyper-realistic imaging conveys uncontrolled gushing oil, roaring flames, and flying bodies in ways unimaginable just a few years ago.The camera-work draws you into the rig with a colour palette that leaves the taste of petroleum in your mouth, but the chaos during the worst of the explosion is beyond cinematic capture. For a large part of the film it is difficult to know what is happening, but that would have been the case when it really happened. If this film intended to be a tribute to the heroic crew, both those who survived and those who did not, then it falls short. Typecast performances are effective in distinguishing the good guys from the bad, but that is all. Nor does it acknowledge the devastation that followed the disaster. It does, however, fill a gap in public awareness about this catastrophic event and that is an achievement.",7,0,0,16 October 2016
Hereditary," a brilliant psycho-drama becomes an ordinary supernatural fantasy
","It is ironic that the supernatural horror genre needs to be grounded in realism in order to be frightening. The closer a film moves towards fantasy the less realistic and therefore less scary it becomes. Lauded by some as the horror film of the year, Hereditary (2018)struggles to balance realism and fantasy in an uneven film that will frighten only those who want to be frightened.This is two films in one: an unsettling and tense portrait of a family psychologically traumatised by deep grief, followed by a bizarre journey into supernatural fantasy. We enter the film at the funeral of a matriarchal grandmother attended by daughter Annie and her husband, Steve (Toni Collette and Gabriel Byrne), and their teenagers Peter and Charlie (Alex Wolff and Milly Shapiro). This is a family with a history of tragic deaths and Annie's eulogy reflects a twisted relationship with the deceased. As a professional miniaturist, she mentally lives inside a dolls' house world where she finds control over the chaos of her family life. While dealing with its recent bereavement, the family soon faces one more that is far more gruesome and bizarre. A cascading avalanche of weird happenings makes it increasingly impossible to separate what is real and what is psychotic hallucination.The first half of the film has all the ingredients of a firmly grounded and brilliant psycho-drama. Toni Collette gives an outstanding performance of a mother on the edge of sanity. Her emotive range is spectacular. In one scene she shares grief with another mother and the tears were flowing in my cinema, something that rarely happens in this genre. Excellent cinematography captures the transition from high-tension family grief to a place of ghostly atmospherics, but soon we find the inevitable reliance on standard horror tropes. There may be grounds, however tenuous, for the film to claim originality in creepiness but this is outweighed by an over-reliance on headless bodies, wispy floating forms, and other stock shlock.Whether this is your horror film of the year will depend on your taste for the fantastic supernatural. The attempt to explain a family's history of tragedy by invoking a ghostly masterplan will be unsatisfying for many. Yet some films in this genre can genuinely haunt you, like the deeply reflective A Ghost Story (2017)that inhabits the terrifying space between death and afterlife, or A Monster Calls (2017) that uses the supernatural to explore fear of death. Hereditarystarts with much potential but settles for the simpler goal of scaring you. These days, fans of this genre expect more.",7,0,2,12 June 2018
Detroit," gripping drama but poor history of the Detroit riots
","All filmmaking is exploitative. Whether it is fair or not will depend on many things, one of which is the respect shown for the film's subject matter. Many movies are marketed as fact-based but really only exploit history to create entertainment. This is the case with Detroit (2017): a gripping drama but a poor historical account of the worst public disorder in the US since the Civil War.Understanding the broader context is important. The Detroit race riots were part of a national wave of civil unrest that swept America in 'The Long Hot Summer of 1967'. There were 159 documented riots across a nation mired in a long history of slavery and systemic discrimination against its African American population. Detroit (2017) compresses the painful history of American racism into a few minutes of simplistic animation followed by archival footage of widespread racial unrest, burning buildings, mass protests, and police confrontations. Most of the two and a half-hour film then presents a prolonged dramatisation of a single episode of police brutality that occurred after the raids that triggered the riots.The early part of the film shows a number of sub-stories coming together as a result of the raids. In the midst of the chaos a group of fleeing African Americans are detained and interrogated in the Algiers Hotel after what was believed to be sniper fire on police and national guards. The handful of police are led by officer Philip Krauss (Will Poulter) who is already under threat of a murder charge after shooting a looter. He is sadistic in his methods. The suspects are kept facing a wall while one by one he applies terror tactics to make them inform on the so-called sniper, even staging fake killings to maximise panic. It is an agonisingly long and repetitive process, during which deliberate and accidental fatalities occur. The film concludes with a brief account of the courtroom drama in which the white officers face a white jury for a predictable outcome.Viewers hoping for a balanced picture of the Detroit race riots of '67 are unlikely to be satisfied. Instead of looking at the climate of hatred for black people, the film presents a 'bad-apple' account of one psychotic policeman with a taste for torture. The portrait of cruelty is performed to perfection. Poulter fills the role with callous indifference to pain or fear and it is his cold- blooded performance that drives the tension curve to its inconclusive finale. While there are many strong performances by others, this is virtually a one-man tour-de-force portrait of right- wing white supremacy.This film is entertaining if you have a taste for prolonged violence. Others may feel that the Detroit riots are being exploited and that racism deserves more respect than a tale of a lone psychotic. A redeeming feature is its timing. It arrives half a century after the depicted events, while alt-right forces of the world are again on the march. Detroit reminds us how ugly civilisation can be.",6,4,11,15 November 2017
Rocketman," a swirling kaleidoscope of emotion and music
","The traditional musical is the oldest film genre and it still relies on magical fantasy for suspending audience disbelief. This allows characters to spontaneously break into song or dance, unlike musical bio-pics such as Bohemian Rhapsody (2018) that realistically integrate the music into their narrative flow. The epic-scaled Rocketman (2019) is a nostalgic reversion to the traditional musical form; knowing this beforehand helps to make sense of what is a swirling kaleidoscope of emotion and music.Where bio-pics tend to look at a life story, the musical Rocketman is a selective biography that traces a musical icon's ascent to the starry heavens during the 70s. The opening minutes are bold, brash, and fantastical: Elton John (Taron Egerton) is resplendent in high-arch feathered sequins, storming toward camera after bailing out of a packed concert hall. He walks across a city and straight into an alcoholic rehab group, plonks into a chair and, staring through trademark crazy glasses, proceeds to unravel his journey as a lonely youth prodigy who became a substance abusing mega-star.What follows is a series of loosely connected vignettes that use musical lyrics as narrative entry-points to explain his complex vulnerabilities. The young Reginald Dwight was raised by emotionally abusive parents who were incapable of loving him, a burden that intensified his desire to be whatever it took to please others. Encouraged by his grandmother, his musical talent grew as a self-defensive response to what he experienced as an uncaring world. The mature Elton John progressed to singing odes of pain, awe, and confused sexual identity, mostly delivered with flamboyance and electric energy. Much of it comes from an unhappy place and this makes the film more revelationery than celebratory.Taron Egerton channels the icon with mesmerising brilliance; it is a performance made more astonishing by singing with astonishing authenticity a dozen songs from Elton John's enormous repertoire. The cinematography is as exuberant as the performances; many scenes verge on musical artworks as the human dynamo appears disconnected from the earth's gravity. The sets and costumes are fabulous, and the pace of the story is captivating.What you take away from Rocketman depends on what you bring in terms of fan status and personal interest. Some will see it as a story of sex, drugs, and rock n' roll; others a musical hero's journey to mega-celebrity. Others may reflect on why there are so many music-inspired films in current cinema. The rise of anti-progressive forces in today's frenetic and fractured world means new generations lack heroes; the revival of heroic musicians might go some way to filling this gap.",9,2,3,11 June 2019
A Star Is Born," a modern classic of musical entertainment
","A universal trope that reappears in various cultural forms is drawn from the Ancient Greek mythology of a sculptor called Pygmalion. After falling in love with one of his statues he was granted a wish that she come to life and love him in return. In its modern form, the story is usually based on a successful male who nurtures the potential of a rising female and is rewarded with love. The unbroken lineage of this narrative can be seen in its latest and most spectacular version of A Star is Born (2018), updated with themes of substance abuse, mental illness, and the fickle perils of celebrity.Jackson Maine (Bradley Cooper) is a famous country music singer who regularly binges on drugs and booze. The film's opening scenes define the man: he holds a packed concert hall in the palm of his hands, then goes onto a night bender in a chauffeured limo. He stops to drink at an obscure drag bar where he is swept away by waitress-singer Ally Campana (Lady Gaga) who mesmerises with her rendition of Edith Piaf's La Vie En Rose. The rest is well known: they fall in love, he literally sweeps her onto the big stage with the simple words 'Just trust me', and she is a knockout. It's a whirlwind romance that sees them bond emotionally and professionally. He fights his addiction and promises to stay clean, but as her celebrity star rises, his tragically falls.Describing the storyline is easy but the powerhouse acting and musical performances of Cooper and Gaga are superlative. Both fill their roles with authenticity because that's who they are. Unlike her real-life persona, here Gaga is stripped bare and is the epitome of vulnerability. Words and melody take second place to the expressiveness in her vocal tones, and her simply divine finalé of 'I'll Never Love Again' is unforgettable. Cooper channels every all-American country singer that ever existed: macho, hard-living, and impossible to listen to without tapping your feet. The chemistry between them is palpable; whether it's in the highs of romance or the lows of shattered lives, the synergy is electric. The cinematography never wavers in its intensity. It turns stage backlights into an organic canvas, and shapes big and small spaces into elements of narrative.Much more could be said, but it's the performances and music that leave their mark. The film has things to say about the misery of addiction and it teases out high-art music against pop pulp. Depending on how you look at it, there is also gender power in play. But these are not what you will remember most. It is a standout musical and a modern classic of entertainment.",9,1,3,29 October 2018
Wind River," a standard vengeance thriller with solid storytelling, exciting visuals, and well-crafted acting
","The vengeance thriller genre has always been popular because its core emotion is universal and forgiveness has human limits. There are many ways to translate this theme to film and most involve 'eye for an eye' violence which is the narrative heart of Wind River (2017). The stand out feature of this film lies in the way it deploys stunning cinematography to tell a reality-based story with rising tension and emotional depth.While protecting livestock from wolves in the snow-covered Wyoming mountains, wildlife hunter Cory Lambert (Jeremy Renner) discovers the frozen body of a barefoot 18-year old girl. The crime scene is on Indian Reservation land and beyond local jurisdiction so rookie FBI agent Jane Banner (Elizabeth Olsen) is sent to investigate. Her inexperience is quickly obvious and she calls on Lambert's hunting skills and knowledge of the Mountain ranges. The investigation unfolds amidst deep distrust that locals have for outsiders and Lambert's grief over the recent loss of his own daughter. His connection with the Indian parents of the missing girl adds a culturally sensitive and emotional layer to what would otherwise be just an action-based thriller.There is little in this story that would earn praise for originality. Its pace is unhurried and the central characters are stereotypes that we have seen before. But it is outstanding in the way the majestic mountain-scapes are integrated into the storytelling through breathtaking panoramic aerial photography. Treacherous weather and the effects of sub-zero temperatures on the human body add to the hidden dangers and the impoverishment of life on native American Reservations. Lambert and Olsen are well-cast as two conflicted loners, giving character performances that drive the film without grandstanding. Dialogue is minimalist as you might expect in an isolated mountain community and a female FBI agent is not going to change that. While shootouts are obligatory in this genre, the violence is swift and essential to the narrative. The film's suspense curve maintains audience engagement until justice and vengeance are served.While this film comes with little fanfare, it has solid storytelling, exciting visuals, and well-crafted acting. It also has a subdued political theme not fully evident until the sobering on-screen message that, even today, no data is collected on the number of American Indian women reported missing. This disturbing insight into the status of today's native American population is balanced by the positive feminist message that is portrayed in a young female heroine using her wits without the hyper-violence seen in so many recent releases.",7,2,6,17 August 2017
The Death of Stalin," a deviously clever satire on Russian politics that is relevant elsewhere
","Political satires are a devious genre for many reasons. They use black comedy to mock their subject but are not always clear about who or what that subject may be. The devilishly dark British-American-French film The Death of Stalin (2017) is ostensibly about the 1953 demise of one of the world's cruellest despots, Joseph Stalin. But when you look closely, you find unmistakable parallels with despots elsewhereThe film quickly shows a Stalinist Russia that is ruled by fear, where no Moscow apparatchik can be sure of living to the end of any day. Having jailed or killed the nation's best doctors, Stalin's stroke is pure karma. His bodyguards outside hear the mighty ruler crash to the floor but were commanded not to interrupt him under any circumstance. As he lay in a puddle of his own urine for several hours, his Central Committee henchmen enter the office one by one to profess their devotion but do nothing. As the tyrants-in-waiting Beria, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Zhukov, and Molotov join the gathering, it is clear that nobody wants Stalin to survive but all are terrified he might live to take it out on them.As Stalin fades away, the jockeying for succession between the aspiring leaders escalates. Nobody trusts anybody, and everybody conspires to eliminate the others. Meanwhile, the population begins compulsory mourning and civil unrest is quelled with mass shootings. By the time of Stalin's funeral, Committee members have plotted and double-crossed each other so many times that nobody knows who will survive. Fake news and information leaks by conspirators are used to frame multiple assassination plots until Khrushchev is the last man standing. As he assumes the role of Russia's Supreme Leader, he is watched from the wings by the up and coming Brezhnev who will soon take his place.All of this sounds like well-documented Russian history, so how is it a comedy? There is a delicious irony in the meticulously constructed and authentic-looking mid-1950s palatial Russian settings and the cast of actors with outrageously exaggerated British, Irish, Scottish and Welsh accents. The intelligently funny one-liners are delivered with forensic timing to portray Russian politics as stranger than fiction. It is no wonder that the film is banned in modern Russia; the callous disregard for human life and the incoherently ridiculous maneuvering for the top job speaks volumes for the way Russia's political process operates. If this is not enough to crack you up, a more sombre insight is that the petty posturing and chaotic decision-making looks contemporary.Students of Russian history may wince at the disrespect shown for an historical era in which so much carnage can be traced directly to Stalin or the suggestion that the Stalin-Khrushchev-Brezhnev triumvirate has transitioned to the Putin era. But this is not a film for serious political discourse; rather it is a lampooning of the political culture existing in many nations that, some may say, has echoes in today's America.",8,8,12,16 April 2018
Darkest Hour," the finest film ever made about the Churchill legend
","In the wake of several high-profile films about Britain's greatest leader, is there anything more to know about Winston Churchill? The archives of history attest to the unique stature of this political figure: more remarkable is the surrounding folklore that has shaped British and world history. It is at this level that Darkest Hour (2017) is perhaps the finest film ever made about the Churchill legend.The dialogue-dense plotline is tightly compressed yet massive in the scale of its largely unseen off-screen action. Set In the critical weeks of May to June 1940, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) emerges as the least objectionable candidate to become Prime Minister after the British Parliament loses confidence in Neville Chamberlain. As the film Dunkirk (2017) so graphically shows, the Nazis had cornered almost the entire British army at Dunkirk and their total destruction was imminent. It was the definitive turning point of World War II: Churchill must inform Parliament that if the British forces are wiped out in France, it may not be long before a swastika will fly from Buckingham Palace. Belgium, France and Holland are entering surrender negotiations and a political group still loyal to Chamberlain are urging that Britain use Mussolini as an intermediary to secure favourable terms for a British surrender. Churchill must weigh the saving of countless young lives if Britain surrenders against the loss of nationhood and life under Nazi rule. As history records, Churchill rejects appeasement and his speeches to the British nation declaring that 'we shall never surrender' are still regarded as among the finest ever made.It needs to be said that Darkest Hour does not add to, nor subtract from, what we know of these historical events: it's power lies entirely in Gary Oldman's tour-de-force performance. More psychological thriller than bio-pic, the plotline advances with electrifying gravity, painfully pausing to amplify the enormity of impending national doom. Oldman executes a brilliant screenplay with eloquence, belligerence, and a gifted gravel-voiced orator's 'call-to-arms' like the world has never seen. As we saw in Churchill (2017), this is a profoundly mortal, flawed, and emotionally vulnerable leader: Oldman is simply brilliant in portraying the knife-edge balancing of two fateful options, both of which would shape the course of modern history like no other single event: surrender or risk annihilation. When President Roosevelt declined his personal call for assistance, it was indeed Britain's darkest hour.This film comes close to being flawless but for one scene that lingers with an air of compromised plausibility. With a Parliamentary speech about to be given, Churchill bolts from a rear car seat and into the London Tube. He enters a carriage full of ordinary citizens and soon has an audience of astonished gazes which become a single chorus urging Churchill to never surrender. Despite the rousing sentiment, the scene plays like a dream sequence from another movie. Perhaps this is trivial in light of what this excellent film achieves: a portrait of a leader who had the weight of the world on his shoulders and the courage to be guided by his uncompromising belief in the British people. As today's British and American leaders offer more walls and less leadership, Darkest Hour is a reminder of what leadership actually means.",9,1,6,11 January 2018
Passengers," What could have been a great sci-fi ends up a rom-com space opera mashup.
","The term mashup is not usually a compliment. It means mixing different genres in a way that looks interesting, gets a laugh, or makes a mess. It is unlikely the sci-fi rom-com melodrama Passengers (2016) intended to be a mashup but that is the result. If it stayed on-track as sci-fi, all the ingredients are present for an outstanding film but box-office considerations require a love story with a moral dilemma so the film ends up a mess.We are aboard an intergalactic spacecraft for a 120-year voyage as part of a commercial outer- world migration venture. The ship's set and digital effects are some of the best seen on film in years, conveying an enormity of scale and futuristic design that is mesmerising. Five thousand volunteers are ensconced in hibernation pods en route to capitalism's version of eternal paradise when one traveller, mechanical engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is accidentally awoken 90 years too soon. Travelling through space with every conceivable luxury at your fingertips, worry-free for the rest of your life, sounds appealing but the problem is that he gets lonely and conversation is very limited with an android bartender. After a year of flying solo he is on the verge of flushing himself into the cosmos, when suddenly he becomes obsessed with sleeping beauty Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and believes he has found true love.Of course true love is never that simple. He first must grapple with the moral horrors of his predicament: does let her sleep in peace for another 90 years so she can live in paradise with the 4,998 other passengers or does he do what the male species has been known to do sometimes and wake her up for some fun. The film trailers make the answer obvious, but when Aurora finds out that Jim was being selfish, she throws a galactic hissy-fit and the film turns into a domestic melodrama with more flashing stars than outer space. She refuses his every advance until the spaceship's gizmos turn wobbly. Forget feminism: a girl needs a guy when things get toughbut let's not go there.All the potential evident in the early part of the film is frittered away in a silly 'romance on the rocks' space opera, where it becomes a philosophical debate on which gender is capable of the greater quantum of selfishness. Pratt and Lawrence are really quite watchable in spite of the script, the filming is very entertaining, and the whole love scenario would have been interesting in someone's earthly kitchen but not on the most advanced galactic odyssey ever undertaken. But if you enjoy turbulent romance in unusual places this is your film. AUTHOR: www.cinemusefilms.com",5,9,19,7 January 2017
The Babadook," Australian filmmakers remain on top for horror and psychological thrillers.
","Its odd to think that film audiences pay good money to experience fear, confusion and even physical discomfort. Maybe its to heighten the pleasures of everyday normality after the show. This film is an unusual hybrid of two closely related but different genres for which Australian filmmakers are acclaimed around the world: the horror and the psychological thriller. The former emphasises bloodshed and the supernatural, the latter leans toward forms of madness with bizarre and deadly outcomes. The difference is important because The Babadook (2014) is devised to be both, and each genre leads to very different interpretations of what we see.Its a straightforward story about a single mother Amelia whose husband died on the way to the hospital when her son Samuel was born. Amelia is finding it increasingly hard to raise Sam and even his cousins do not want to be near him on his seventh birthday. He believes that a scary Dr Seuss-type character called the Babadook creeps out of the storybook that his mother reads to him at night. This is where the twin film genres diverge. The para-normal happenings can be seen as classic horror, with no logical explanation necessary, just a complete suspension of disbelief. On the other hand, we may be seeing a classic case study in delayed bereavement psychosis, and everything we see is happening only in Amelia's mind.The anxiety-inducing lighting and camera-work carry the atmospherics of the story, but the acting performance of Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman are simply outstanding. Essie transitions between a struggling but likable mother to a woman well beyond the brink of utter despair to complete madness. For his age, Noah shows an extraordinary gift for acting and those huge innocent eyes only accentuate the terror we see. Both actors have the critical element of plausibility that sustains the gradually escalating tension throughout the film. If you are a fan of either fear genre, this is one of the best in the current crop.",7,3,5,10 February 2016
The Danish Girl," Its like watching a newborn chick push its way through the shell of an egg
","This extraordinary film is a two-headed hydra that swings between an exquisitely beautiful study of how little separates the genders, and a dark biopic of social prejudice against those who want release from their birth gender. Based loosely on the first recorded case of gender reassignment surgery, it's a story of married Danish artists Einar and Gerda Wegener whose relationship is transformed when Einar is encouraged by his wife to express the feminine self trapped within him.The acting virtuosity of Eddie Redmayne as Einer is the beating heart of this film, just as he was the very soul of physicist Stephen Hawking in The Theory of Everything (2015). Starting as a playful game between two creative aesthetes, Einer incrementally explores coming out as a woman in a society not ready to even name people like him. At times melodramatic, the film is like watching a newborn chick push its way through the shell of an egg: one faint crack becomes several and suddenly a new life form emerges, bewildered by the public gaze and nowhere to hide.The cinematography is lush and painterly. Several scenes incorporate original Wegener portraits and landscapes to create a living art gallery where Einar metaphorically paints himself into herself as Lili, the camera dwelling on feminine rituals that show the transformational power of cosmetic and fashion adornments. Some of the multi-depth close-up shots are themselves masterpieces that frame original paintings with their live subject in sets that resemble an artist's canvas. As Lili experiences the sexual advances of males, she yearns for a cure for the 'sickness' of wrong genitalia. It's a sensitive portrayal of a complex issue for many who, like Lili, were prepared to risk their lives with pre-modern surgery to be who they wanted to be. Not all viewers will want to share that journey, but those who respect it will have much to admire in this film.",9,1,2,11 February 2016
Spotlight," A fine tribute to ethical journalism and its power to do good.
","This film is a David and Goliath style investigative drama wherein brave journalism exposes evil, which in this case is the systemic corruption found in the Catholic archdiocese of Boston in the early 2000s. While stories about child abuse are not designed for entertainment, this one is a highly engaging thriller about the Boston Globe's specialist team called Spotlight that challenged one of the most powerful institutions on earth. Its linear plot-line unfolds gradually to let you share the discovery of the tip of a corruption iceberg that kept getting bigger and bigger.The story itself is now global knowledge and countries around the world are still coming to terms with child abuse scandals that will take generations to remediate, forgive, and forget. Spotlight uses the cinematic device of dramatic understatement to give viewers the emotional space in which to confront the enormity of the facts as they become known. This understatement includes a slow narrative, a crisp factual script with little melodrama, actor authenticity with none of the five investigators stealing any limelight, and muted de-saturated colours to convey the rat-hole nature of investigative journalism. Its a small group of tenacious foot-sloggers in an old-fashioned hunt for truth, but they bring down the house of god armed with just facts and faith.The larger moral tale beyond the film points to a primal human weakness seen repeatedly on a grand scale throughout the history of mankind: shamefully knowing but not acting. The passing mention of 'good Germans' is one hint of this bigger message. When the evidence piles up about offending priests, corrupt senior clergy, official cover ups, victim pay offs, hidden or re-assigned offenders who were free to re-offend, it becomes clear that entire communities turned a blind eye to what was happening. The church, schools, local government, and perhaps saddest of all, parents, chose silence to protect their faith. When good people ignore evil, everyone is morally culpable. This film tells the story without dramatics and with respect for victims needing a voice. The revelations of Spotlight led to 600 cases being exposed and triggered hundreds of similar investigations that continue around the world. This film is a fine tribute to ethical journalism and its power to do good.",8,2,4,11 February 2016
Concussion," Footballers are the gladiators of our time and the NFL is big business.
","Investigative dramas are characterised by an imbalance of power between those seeking the truth and those who withhold it. The genre is popular because audiences identify with underdogs and speaking out in the face of danger is what heroism is about. Of the current releases, Concussion (2015) shares this dynamic with Spotlight (2015) and Truth (2015), and all are based on fact. This film is the story of a modest hero who inconveniently discovers why so many pro footballers were dying and the vested interests that tried to silence him.Footballers are the gladiators of our time, and the NFL is both big business and integral to the 'American Dream'. With his trademark humour and understatement, Will Smith is a natural in the role of Nigerian doctor, Bennet Omalu, who discovers a pattern of brain damage amongst top players who were dying at an alarming rate, many by their own hand. The condition can only be discovered via an autopsy and the game's governing body went into denial when Omalu presented the evidence. In the face of death threats, character assassination, and FBI harassment to have him deported, this lone black immigrant medic would not be silenced in saying that grid-iron was killing its players. Based on his work, the new disease was named chronic traumatic encephalopathy, now known as CTE. A charmingly restrained love story is woven into the film, not to distract or romanticize, but to accentuate Omalu's vulnerability once he had a family to protect.Smith's acting anchors the film and the avoidance of soap-box lectures gives the story objectivity amidst the emotional provocation that occurs. The film gives hope that in the future when head smashes occur, the ones that make fans roar loudest and watch again in slow-motion on the big- screen, they will remember Will Smith explaining that, unlike animals, the human brain has no shock absorbers and every smash propels the brain against the skull. Like so many excellent investigative dramas, this film has the potential to change social attitudes about the risks our gladiators take for our entertainment. This well made film needs to be watched by parents, players and sports administrators alike.",8,1,5,13 February 2016
Youth," Unexpectedly, this one slides onto my list of all-time favourites.
","Resort genre films are curious things that work by isolating interesting character-types from their real lives into a fantasy setting where they can reflect, explore, regret or die. Youth (2015) does this using a painterly canvas of mostly humorous insights into love, success, failure and life's inescapable endpoint. Set in a luxury alpine resort amidst stunning scenery, the separate human sketches are individual artworks that merge into an opus greater than the sum of its parts. The cinematography and dramatic musical score forms a melancholic symphony blending sounds and images of youth and beauty, ageing and dying. It can just as easily confuse, overwhelm, or delight the senses.Like life itself, the film is full of opposites: Michael Caine is the self-obsessed Maestro, the composer whose creativity has dried up as he mourns for his dying wife and once stellar career. Harvey Keitel, as film producer Mick, cannot stop working even though his films peaked a long time ago. When his long-time leading lady Brenda (Jane Fonda) tells him his career as a producer is finished, it triggers a masterful scene of understated pathos that many viewers will miss entirely unless paying close attention. As quick as a blink, Mick exits as just another extra on the stage of life.But the elephant in the room asks: is this an old man's film? No it is not, and there is something for everyone. A voluptuous Miss Universe provides the marketing eye-candy with a few seconds of bare flesh and intelligent dialogue to prove beauty and brains co-exist. Maestro's beautiful daughter Lena, dumped by a husband wanting better sex, delivers a tour de force monologue about her absent father. An ex-sci-fi star offers deadpan wisdom wrapped in wry humour, and a monk's parodic levitation reminds everyone not to take it all too seriously. The wit and wisdom of beautiful young people cuts through the homilies of elders to stop Youth from being just a maudlin tale of loss. Unexpectedly, this one slides onto my list of all-time favourites.",9,2,4,11 February 2016
"I, Tonya"," a compelling portrait of an abused skater-made-good
","From its confessional title to inconclusive finale, I, Tonya (2017) is the kind of film that leaves you wondering why it was made. The fragmented mockumentary approach disguises a lightweight narrative filled mostly with deplorable people with few redeeming qualities. However, Margot Robbie's compelling portrait of an abused skater-made-good turns an otherwise lacklustre melodrama into an engaging performance.The pathologically unfiltered stage-mother LaVona Fay Golden (Allison Janney) was the kind of mother than nobody deserved. She forced her four-year daughter into ice skates and a life of verbal and physical abuse. Without ever once enjoying a mother's praise, Tonya Harding (Margot Robbie) grew up a talented competitive figure skater who had nothing else in her life except Olympic dreams. To escape her mother, she fell in with another abuser Jeff Gillooley (Sebastian Stan) who became her husband. Despite the elite skating fraternity looking down on Tonya for her loud-mouthed brashness and being too poor to buy costumes, she competed at the 1992 Winter Olympics to win a fourth place. Retiring briefly, she mounted a comeback while her husband and his moronic friends arranged an inept attack on Tonya's main skating rival Nancy Kerrigan. She recovered quickly yet the entire story leads to the question: what was Tonya's role in the attack?It is difficult to label this film: it is not a serious whodunit nor is it funny enough to call it a black comedy. The mockumentary technique leans heavily towards telling rather than showing and the narrative is disrupted constantly by actors shifting out of character and into the role of interviewee. But the effect of multiple narrators is to construct a swirling matrix of viewpoints, in the middle of which Tonya desperately struggles to find respect and belonging. Margot Robbie's performance is outstanding. To convincingly play a girl from the wrong side of the tracks who was force-fed elite skating despite abuse from her mother, husband, sporting judges, and the media, is no small achievement. Whether the film makes a compelling case that we should care at all is another matter. With Tonya centre stage, the camera treads lightly over her abusers and leaves us guessing about her involvement in the Kerrigan attack.If you are hoping to see some skating excitement the film will disappoint. There is a noticeable absence of narrative tension in either the characters or depicted events, yet the story engages our sympathy for Tonya. Themes like the discriminatory politics of elite sport and the social burdens of class and family dysfunction get a light airing, but it's hard to see this as a message film. Those who remember the real Tonya and the attack will find it interesting. For others, the unusual story format and characterisations are more enough to hold your attention.",7,4,8,15 January 2018
Molly's Game," an lightweight expose of the seedy world of high-stakes gambling
","A film does not need a message to be meaningful, but it can feel lightweight without one. Even a big-name star and a brisk plotline provides little weight in a story about illicit money and a gambling queen's efforts to keep ahead of the law. That, in essence, is the plotline of Molly's Game (2017), a fast-moving tale that struggles to say anything of value.Based on real events and published in her 2014 memoir, Molly Bloom (Jessica Chastain) was a world-class skier whose Olympic aspirations were shattered through injury. An overbearing father and over-achieving brothers means that failure is not an option, so Molly finds her way into the company of a high-stakes gambling den operator. She becomes the den manager and glamour bait for high-profile and high-wealth players. The intricacies of poker playing become interwoven with the narrative, and we see in detail gaming rules and techniques that few will have heard of. Molly is super-bright and learns quickly, making enough money to set up her own luxury-class den in opposition. Her success and notoriety draw the FBI and the Russian mafia into her orbit, and she faces prison after publishing a tell-all book. With the help of top lawyer Charlie Jeffrey (Idris Elba) she fights to restore her seized assets.If the film was fictional, you could read it as a high-stakes thriller, a feminist tale, or a hustler's mockumentary. However, as it is based on Molly Bloom's real career, it becomes a voyeuristic expose of the seedy world of illicit gambling, money laundering and racketeering that is inhabited by the rich and famous. What is not clear is why this film was made at all. For those interested in professional poker, it no doubt has much to offer. Molly's character has few redeeming qualities except being smart and ambitious, and she outshines every male around her. She is also clinically ruthless and emotionally distant, making her character difficult to embrace. Chastain plays all these characteristics to perfection.Finding a worthwhile message in this film is a challenge. Perhaps it's about a woman's mastery of a man's world, using both brains and conspicuous sexuality. Or perhaps it is found in the film's closing minutes when, with condescending masculine authority, Molly's lawyer says 'you're my daughter's role model, and I'm OK with that'. He may be; many are not.",6,2,5,14 February 2018
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," a mother's enraged quest for justice at any cost
","If it were possible to name the dominant emotion swirling around the world today it would be anger. Its many causes include social inequality, political instability, and global brinkmanship, all of which create a collective sense of helplessness due to events and systems over which we have no control. Any film that gives expression to this anger is cathartic, and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) hits this mark right from the outset.
Seven months after the rape and murder of Angela Hayes, her mother Mildred (Frances McDormand) is ready to explode. Local police investigations have stalled, she is not getting any updates, and she believes that much more could be done. She rents three neglected billboards and plasters three simple messages against blood-red backgrounds: 'Raped while dying'; 'And still no arrests'; and 'How come, Chief Willoughby?'. The shocked town is instantly divided into those sympathetic to Mildred's plight and those supportive of terminally ill Chief Willoughby (Woody Harrelson). Police are outraged, national media get involved, and Mildred's son and former husband try to talk her out of her protest. Events spiral out of control: there are outbursts of police racism, homophobia, bashings, arson, a suicide, as well as community outpouring of sympathy for Willoughby and blame for Mildred. Undeterred and hell bent on revenge, she sets a course into nihilism without regard for the consequences.
Not since Network (1978) when enraged Peter Finch screamed 'I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore' has a film penetrated the global zeitgeist with such forensic accuracy. When Mildred lets loose, it feels good and right. McDormand's powerhouse feminist performance makes this her film: no other contemporary actress does cold anger like she can and still offer a warm vulnerability to make us care. Harrelson is a complex opposite: reasonable, wounded, and compassionate. His likeability is the film's greatest complication: while we share Mildred's anger we also want to quarantine Willoughby, especially when we meet his beautiful wife and daughters.
Three Billboards is telling us that to feel human we sometimes must do extreme things. Whether you accept that message or not, this film offers a safety valve for anyone who feels crushed by the system. Labelling it a 'black comedy' is a loose fit for a film full of surprises where most of the humour is found in lightning fast one-liners laced with multiple F-bombs. The blackness lies in the moral ambiguity of Mildred's behaviour: she is channelling eye-for-an-eye justice and it matters little if the wrong person pays. Whatever you make of it, this is a gripping film that you are unlikely to forget soon.

Lion," An immensely satisfying cinematic experience: visually stunning, narratively powerful, and an emotional whirlwind. Best Aussie film of the year.
","If film-art is the pursuit of visual pleasure, powerful storytelling and high emotional impact, then Lion (2016) is the year's high-water mark for Australian productions. Based on the novel A Long Way Home (2014), this film adaptation is a richly textured essay on the primal human need for belonging that will resonate with anyone who has ever wondered who they are.This true story is told in two parts and filmed across two continents. Five year-old Saroo is a ragamuffin sidekick to his older brother Guddo, two poor boys who support their family by stealing coal and scavenging trains in their West Bengal village. They become separated one night and Saroo finds himself alone on a train heading to the other side of India. He he joins hordes of homeless children who must fend off predators while begging to survive. Eventually he is placed in a crowded orphanage, then adopted by two big-hearted and childless Tasmanians, Sue (Nicole Kidman) and John (David Wenham). Twenty years on, Saroo (Dev Patel) begins to have memory flashbacks of his native land. As they increase in intensity, he becomes obsessed with finding his family. With some luck and Google maps, the story comes full circle.There is so much that makes this film stand out. The storytelling is more than engaging: it is so captivating that the two-hour run-time feels like an hour. Acting performances are outstanding: Nicole Kidman is at her best while the five year-old Saroo (Sunny Pawar) is the heart of the film and Dev Patel its soul. The cinematography is brilliant, especially the filming in India. The camera-work is both expansive and intimate, shifting often from sweeping aerial panoramas of mountainous Indian countryside and tranquil Tasmanian waterways to narrow winding alleys, village markets, and the inner-world of Saroo's turmoil. Some of the most powerful scenes are shot from the eye-level of a terrified lost boy jostled by masses of humanity and the close-ups of Saroo's painful face desperate to know home. The colour palette is exotic, sound track emotionally intense, and the directing finds a rhythm that is almost orchestral.This film offers an immensely satisfying cinematic experience: visually stunning, narratively powerful, and an emotional whirlwind. It comes at the end of a very mixed year for Australian film, with some of the world's finest produced but many that are less than inspiring. Lion is one of those films that will appeal to everyone and it has a very long after-taste. It easily tops my film year.",9,121,159,22 December 2016
The Lost City of Z," a solid tale made lacklustre in the telling
","Deceptive titles might improve box office but they do little for a film's integrity. The Lost City of Z (2017) will no doubt attract audiences with the prospect of a lost antiquity but that is not what this film is about. It's a true story based on an ego-driven British explorer who is obsessed with finding an ancient civilisation so he can restore honour to his family name.Set in 1905, the storyline covers an epic quarter of a century in several bold leaps of time and place. Percy Fawcett (Charlie Hunnam) struggles for advancement as a British officer because his gambling and boozing father brought disgrace to the family name. When given an opportunity to map the Amazon rainforest Percy leaves his pregnant wife Nina (Sienna Miller), knowing it might take years, all for the hope of personal glory. During the expedition, he learns of a lost ancient city full of untold riches but is forced to return to England before he can investigate. While British scientists scoff at the notion of a lost civilisation he is soon back in the Amazon, this time to find the lost city he calls 'Z'. Forced again to abandon the expedition, the cycle is repeated many years later when he sets off for the Amazon with his now young adult son.Despite having high production values, this film is an interesting example of thematic incoherence. Put simply: it does not know what it wants to be. It mixes an old-fashioned adventure tale with romantic melodrama, historical biography, thriller, period drama, with a World War I movie thrown in for good measure. The narrative arc is repetitive and the timeframe leaps are jarring. There are just so many times one can endure the sight of explorers encountering the same dangers and similar outcomes. The cinematography is magnificent but does not offset the trite dialogue and contrived skirmishes with Amazon natives and the British establishment. At times the dangers of exploring the Amazon appear as arduous as a weekend scouting camp except for the implausible moment when Percy stands tall under a shower of native spears shielded only by his journal. The colonial supremacy and the 'all-men-are-equal' themes are laboured to the point of lecturing, and the script at times falls through the floor, like when Nina farewells a son she may never see again with the words 'have fun'. The main actors seem to play their stereotypes rather than express their roles with nuance and authenticity, and the relationship between Percy and Nina is meant to be foundational but conveys as plastic. While the film's title promises excitement, the meandering story keeps disappointing so that by the end one doesn't really care if the city existed or not.Of course, British filmmakers are excellent in depicting the snobbishness of their society and this is a highlight of the film. The attempt to include moral discourse on British colonialism and feminism is tokenistic, but it does provide some insight into the ideas and attitudes that prevailed early last century. Some will find this uneven film engaging while others will welcome the credits when they arrive after what feels like an excessively long two hours and twenty minutes. At best, it is a solid tale made lacklustre in the telling.",6,1,2,28 August 2017
Dunkirk," a special effects spectacular based on Dunkirk history
","As the movie world erupts in loud applause for Dunkirk (2017) there is a serious question being overlooked. A defining characteristic of historical drama is that it leaves us with a better understanding of history. If a viewer knew nothing of the history of Dunkirk would this film make sense? In other words, does this film have a coherent narrative that explains what happened or is it a digital effects spectacular?Dunkirk depicts three dramatised military scenarios that unfold in the air, on the ground, and at sea. Viewers must draw on prior knowledge to make sense of why 400,000 mostly British troops became trapped on a French coastline surrounded by German forces and facing imminent annihilation. The only hope to save what Churchill had called 'the whole root and core and brain of the British Army' was to evacuate the troops across the English Channel. From fragments of talk between officers we gather that British Forces were unable to provide effective air support and troop-carrying vessels, so a hastily arranged flotilla of 800 British fishing boats and pleasure craft are sailing towards Dunkirk to save whoever they can carry. The action shifts frequently between parallel and sequential timeframes: in one scene, the camera is running along a beach, the next flying in a Spitfire sortie, then on top of or under a sinking ship. There are no prominent protagonists or antagonists, just archetypes of military and civilian personnel, both heroic and not. We follow a couple of young soldiers fleeing for their lives while enemy bombings and gunfire tear into their comrades. We meet a British civilian skipper who has answered the evacuation call and follow his journey across the channel to rescue soldiers from bombed ships and downed planes. We share the cockpit of a lone British fighter pilot as he fires on enemy planes to stop them bombing British troops on the beaches and on vessels, all while knowing that he is running out of fuel.What happens in each of the film's fictional scenarios is not the point: it is the totality of chaos and the scale of relentless carnage that assaults audience senses. When seen in high resolution 70mm film the spectacle is overwhelming. The booming soundtrack is repetitive and manipulative; constant percussive pulses and orchestral strings designed for only one purpose: to increase audience heart-rate. The dialogue is minimalist and voice recording quality in several scenes is poor but the action is all that matters. The scale of the combat scenes is massive and there are numerous scenes where the viewer will be disorientated, not knowing the good guys from the bad. But this is a pale imitation of what it must feel like in the chaos of battle.This is hardly entertainment. If the director's intention is to numb viewer's senses with a 106- minute glimpse of hell then this film is a success. If it is to tell the story of Dunkirk, it just does not have the narrative framework to explain how and why one of the world's biggest military disasters even happened. If it is to commemorate the Battle of Dunkirk, then turning the story into a massive digital effects spectacle makes a limited contribution to our collective memory of what has been described as the crucial turning point of World War II. Where it fails to illuminate Dunkirk history it makes up for as an immersive masterpiece of spectacle.",7,2,5,20 July 2017
Jackie," Natalie Portman gives a memorable performance about an unforgettable event.
","History and drama often make awkward bedfellows, as you might find in the bio-pic Jackie (2016). The assassination of JFK is one of the defining moments of the 20th century and any dramatization of the immediate aftermath is a risky venture. History buffs may fault it and others may struggle with its melodramatic interpretation of Jaqueline Kennedy's life-defining event. But look beyond the cinematic limitations and you find a complex portrait of a remarkable person who endured an unimaginable horror with rare strength and dignity.The film's starts with the motorcade in which John F. Kennedy was assassinated and ends with his funeral. The narrative is framed around a journalist's interview conducted a week after the event and a confessional talk with a priest at the funeral. It uses their questions and comments to trigger flashbacks to the short JFK presidency, with dramatisations that craft together archival footage and historical photographs. The title of the film makes it clear that this is a portrait of Jackie (played by Natalie Portman) so her words, her emotions, and her actions are the primary focus. The film's narrative tension comes entirely from the depiction of her inner world of private trauma and her struggles with the political and public reaction to the event.The most striking aspect of Portman's portrayal is her ability to present several sides of the one persona as if she and Jackie shared multiple personalities. Once you recover from the distraction that Portman barely resembles Jaqueline Kennedy, she takes you on an emotional roller-coaster, from terror, anger, hate, confusion, mental vacillation and disorientation to calm resolve about her role in history. Throughout it all she remains committed to turning a tragedy into national mythology based on political heroism, the Kennedy legend, and the Camelot fairy tale. While there is a commendable support cast, this is a one-woman performance and Portman's portrayal is a tour de force.Some will find this film an unflattering interpretation of Jaqueline Kennedy while others will find that it helps them to sympathetically understand the person behind the mask. The film steers a fine line in avoiding judgement and it is Portman's dramatic ability to step into Jackie's soul and to capture her mental trauma that ultimately shines. No bio-pic is perfect and you need to overlook scenes where the film struggles with period authenticity. Set this aside and you will be rewarded with a memorable performance about an unforgettable event. AUTHOR: cinemusefilms.com",8,3,9,16 January 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A contrived story without a narrative core.
","In a year of generally mediocre films it is not difficult to stand out, especially if your name is Quentin Tarantino. Whether the critical acclaim heaped on Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (2019) is warranted or not depends on your taste for films without a narrative core that ooze melodramatic nostalgia and blur the transient realities of watching movies about making movies.The plotline unfolds in slow motion and when it finally does, it is largely inconsequential. The story is based around the declining career of a 1950s B-grade Western actor called Rick Dalton (Leonardo DiCaprio) whose last chance is to capitalise on the popularity of 'spaghetti westerns'. His alter ego and long-time double Cliff Booth (Brad Pitt) is the real thing: a war veteran and martial arts expert whose role in life is to make Rick believe in himself, despite the truth. Within this loose cinematic frame, the film meanders from skit to skit without the connective tissue that makes for purposeful or coherent storytelling. It builds a two and a half hour filmic scaffold that culminates in ten gruesome minutes loosely based on the Charles Manson-inspired murder of Sharon Tate (Margot Robbie).The only lingering after-effect of seeing this film is to question why it was made at all. Neither of the buddy stars are likeable people: Rick is self-serving, weak and shallow, and Cliff doubles up on these qualities and adds a taste for violence. Their acting is understandably old-school and contrived. Sharon is paraded as the film's visual centrepiece, a role she fills remarkably well despite being given a script that renders her practically dumb. The relationship between the buddies, the Manson cult, and the murders is non-existent other than to imply that nothing needs to make sense if it is linked to Hollywood.The sole redeeming feature of this film is its forensic attention to reproducing the sets, fashion, styles, and social mores of the 1960s. The archival television and movie footage recreate the ambience and ambivalence of the cultural upheaval that we now refer to as the 'golden era' or 'heyday' of film and television. While this will appeal to many, others will be distracted by the film's fractured storyline and its contrived vignettes of the past.
Blending history, fantasy, and entertainment is Tarantino's ultimate purpose. His message is simple: the fairy tale of Hollywood is and has always been a chimera.",7,1,1,28 December 2019
Get Out," An entertaining but predictable horror spoof mixed with clever racial satire.
","You know we are in a post-Oscars movie slump when a satire horror like Get Out (2017) can generate global praise for bravely cutting new ground in film. The truth is: it does not. What it does is satirise the political correctness of a white majority that expresses racial tolerance but harbours malice for those who are different. Set aside that message and you are left with a well-paced, well- acted but predictable horror film that preys on white guilt and coloured fear.The storyline is clear-cut and entirely consistent with the standard tropes of zombie-like horrors. Cool black photographer Chris Washington (Daniel Kaluuya) and his gorgeous wide-smiling girlfriend Rose Armitage (Allison Williams) have been dating seriously for a few months when Rose arranges a weekend to meet the parents. She insists that it is not worth mentioning that Chris is a black dude as her neurosurgeon father Dean and psychiatric hypnotherapist mother Missy are so liberally non-racist that 'they would have voted for a third Obama term'. Driving onto the sprawling grounds of her parent's home Chris notices a black gardener with a weird smile who stares vacantly. The camera cuts to Chris's face and we know immediately what he is thinking. After an effusively over-friendly greeting by the parents at the front doorstep, Chris sees a black housemaid with the same weirdly vacant stare. After an awkwardly polite dinner where Chris is subjected to the usual new-boyfriend interrogation, Missy tricks him into being placed in a hypnotic state that renders him controllable by the tinkling of a spoon in a teacup. From here on, the story shows Chris increasingly entrapped by the family until he realises his life is in danger and that he must 'get out'.From the minute that Chris sees the look on the gardener's face most of the script is laid bare. If that does not sufficiently telegraph the narrative arc that lies ahead, the dinner with the parents make the trap and its dangers obvious. The story pivots on the plausibility of a tinkling teacup making Chris comatose and the duplicity of his girlfriend as the collector of fine black human specimens for neuro-transplant purposes. But of course, in the horror genre there are no boundaries for plausibility and no limits to the gory ways of ending someone's life. While the plot's weirdness requires suspension of disbelief, the casting and acting is excellent and delivers entertainment value for horror audience's money. Although words like original do not suit this film, it is tightly directed and holds enough twisted surprises to keep viewers engaged as it cruises to its entertainingly blood-filled climax.Some of the over-hyped publicity surrounding this film dwells more on its racial message than its merits as a horror film. Indeed, some are even calling it a landmark in socially progressive film. For this to pass any plausibility test, we must be prepared to imagine that the most vocal middle-class supporters of racial equality in contemporary society are most likely the ones that, subliminally at least, harbour the most evil intentions towards coloured minorities. This would be a regressive exploitation of a complex social issue that, in this writer's view, is not what this film is about. It's just an entertaining horror spoof mixed with clever racial satire that is filling cinemas while we wait for the next round of Oscar nominated movies.",7,8,15,27 April 2017
Room," Starts strong but slowly loses focus as it drifts aimlessly towards the end.
","The crime of kidnapping and extended captivity is well known through media exposure that sensationalises the psychological horrors of confinement in claustrophobic spaces. The dependency of some victims on an abusive captor or prison is just one of the many strange twists found in captivity stories. But this one is different because it is narrated through the eyes of five- year old Jack who was born in a fortified shed with only a small overhead skylight visually connected to what is outside his world called Room. His mother was abducted at seventeen and has been a captive for seven years, raising Jack as best she can in a co-dependent relationship that shines beautifully in their small prison. When tormentor Nick loses his job she knows he will not keep them alive, and that's when the slow-paced narrative opens predictably towards a fast world full of frighteningly wonderful sights and sounds and feelings expressed through the naivety of a newborn five-year old.This film would not work without the emotionally intelligent acting of Jacob Tremblay as Jack. Being almost ten and convincingly presenting as half his age is nothing short of remarkable. He describes his new world through wide eyes and lyrical words that capture the exploding space into which he is thrust, and he alone holds this film together. As Ma, Brie Larson's acting fixates on maternal dynamics at the cost of a convincing portrayal of captivity trauma. The scene where Jack and Ma re-visit Room after Nick is caught has all the nonchalance of strolling through a museum, as the story winds down from the highs of a taut psychological thriller to a modest melodrama. It is after all a film that strives for insight, not entertainment, while remaining true to the book upon which it is based. It does this thoughtfully in the first half, but slowly loses focus as it drifts aimlessly towards the end.",7,4,9,11 February 2016
A Quiet Place," stay quiet or a slimy creature will eat you
","It's hard to find a good horror film. You would think that as fear and love are universal polar opposites it would not be that difficult to work them into a plausible plotline that generates terror, or at least surprises. But alas, even with all the digital effects at filmmaker's disposal, most of today's horrors fall back on slimy-looking creatures that want to eat you. A Quiet Place (2018) is yet another example of this oeuvre.The 'future post-apocalyptic dystopia' is the standard narrative framework for depicting a world without order or logic and it is the mainstay of this film. We are not told what happened, but it has devastated humanity and there are few survivors. In the film's opening scenes, a family forages in an abandoned supermarket for survival essentials. They tiptoe in silence and communicate in sign-language (which we follow in sub-titles). We soon glean that the devastation has been caused by hidden predators who move at the speed of light and attack lifeforms that emit sound. As the family returns to their fortified dwelling we see an unfortunate example of how effective the creatures can be when silence is broken.The rest of the film strings out the 'deadly silence' theme into a variety of situations to show how resourceful the family can be in coping with ever-present danger. They lay trails of sand to deaden footsteps, muffle solid objects, and have built a soundproof bunker for the imminent arrival of a new baby. The husband and wife team of John Krasinski and Emily Blunt (who are also married in real life) work as best they can with the material they have, but the sign-language communication feels mechanistic and their pantomime performance of fear unconvincing given the scale of peril they face. A sub-plot around a rebellious teenage daughter has all the hallmarks of a narrative filler to give the film more texture while the prolonged silence becomes louder and louder as the film wears on. By mid-way the cast have exhausted their repertoire of terrified expressions, so the rest of the film is repetitive and too long.A healthy box-office result suggests that many horror fans will disagree with these comments. While the central premise has some novelty, the use of silence to create an atmosphere of terror is hardly original; neither are the digital beasts. The film's marketing hype concentrates on the power of silence, but this is a distraction from a conventional 'slimy creatures' format. Like all horrors, it must stand or fall on the impact of its climax. Unfortunately, the ending is telegraphed well before the final scenes and played out as imagined. So, the search for a good horror continues.",5,7,13,16 April 2018
Ex Machina," A tautly directed and well scripted sci-fi that remains within the boundaries of scientific plausibility.
","Breaking genre rules is the spice of cinema life and Ex Machina (2015) breaks them all as a hybrid sci-fi chamber thriller with pretensions of stretching science into the realm of the gods (the title alludes to 'god from machine'). Science fiction films exist to provoke awe and even fear at the power of science, and today it is focused especially on the field of artificial intelligence and the possibility that man will one day create a sentient being capable of self-redesign (a hypothetical point futurists call 'the singularity'). The 'chamber' dynamic puts a small number of people into a confined space over a short period of time to intensify their interactions, and when their intentions are unknown or unhinged, the thriller genre emerges in all its frightening glory.These are the key ingredients of a story in which IT nerd Caleb Smith (Domhnall Gleeson) wins a competition to spend a week with his firm's reclusive CEO (Oscar Isaac) during which he will administer a Turing test to the boss's newest creation, an android called Eva (Alicia Vikander). As an historical aside, this still influential test was developed in 1950 by the 'father of computing' Alan Turing to tell the difference between humans and robots. Put simply, if the answers given by an android can pass as human, then artificial intelligence is said to exist. Caleb is thrilled by the opportunity, even if the bearded beer-swilling iron-pumping CEO gives him the creeps. But it's a chess game of guessing what is happening, who is manipulating who, and what is the real reason Caleb is there. Ultimately the story poses the question: is it possible for a human creation to rise against its human creator? If you think this is fantasy, Google 'the singularity'.With brilliantly atmospheric photography, a secluded setting, and three well-defined characters competing for control, this is a tautly directed and well scripted sci-fi that remains within the boundaries of scientific plausibility. If anything is out of balance, it is the acting of Alicia Vikander as the android. Her presence tends to overwhelm any film in which she appears, like in the recent films The Danish Girl (2015) and Testament of Youth (2015). But that is hardly criticism. This is an intelligent, engaging and thoughtful exploration of where the field of artificial intelligence stands today, where it is heading, and the issues to be confronted as we look beyond our current knowledge horizons.",7,1,2,16 March 2016
Hidden Figures," A feel-good bio-pic about a remarkable episode in history.
","Before the feminist era, written history was mostly about men while women were by-lines and coloured women non-existent. In the past several decades, women have been reclaiming their place in history and the film Hidden Figures (2016) is part of this cultural change. It is a story that celebrates the achievements of a hitherto un-acknowledged group of women who were called 'coloured computers' before the first mainframe IBM was ready for NASA in the 1960s.Based on real events, the film is set against the Cold War and the frantic race between America and Russia to put the first man on the Moon. More than space science, it was about competing political systems and bragging rights for aeronautical supremacy. The story centres on three gifted coloured women who joined the space program: mathematician Katherine Johnson (Taraji P. Henson) audits the calculations of white male scientists and devises new mathematical solutions for trajectory calculations; Dorothy Vaughan (Octavia Spencer) teaches herself complex Fortran code to become the expert on the IBM computer and NASA's first coloured supervisor; and Mary Johnson (Janelle Monae) wins the right to enrol in a segregated engineering course to become NASA's first coloured female engineer. The trio are part of a scientific group that is under immense political pressure to achieve the successful manned spaceflight which became astronaut John Glenn's space legacy.The historical facts frame the story but it is the treatment of the facts that makes the film interesting. It could have been a tense drama or dry bio-pic but instead it is full of comedic moments and under-stated racial vignettes. For example, on her first day Katherine is mistaken for a janitor and all the coloured women must walk half a mile to use the segregated bathroom. Despite the best available 'white brains' only a coloured woman can work out the new IBM computer and astronaut John Glenn will not 'lift off' unless Katherine first checks the IBM trajectory calculations. The ironies are not designed to get laughs, but to show how even the nation's finest scientific minds were locked into systemic racial discrimination in a NASA culture that was blind to its own prejudices.This is a great film on many levels. As a bio-pic, it carries the weight of history in telling a story that must be told. The acting is outstanding, with a perfect balance between depicting the ugly side of racial oppression and the women's determination to contribute to aeronautical science. Character development is on the light side as the focus is not on personality but on achievement. The trio of stars all portray dignity under duress and their repressed anger saves the film from turning into a lecture. It achieves what any bio-pic drama can hope for: it offers feel-good entertainment while informing about a remarkable episode in history.",8,3,9,2 February 2017
Sing Street," a joyful upbeat film that expresses youth's unshakeable belief in the power of music
","For many people, garage bands are synonymous with adolescence and its associated yearnings for identity, independence and fun. The Irish-produced Sing Street (2016) steps into this space with a more complex mixture of ingredients than is usual for such films. Described as a musical comedy, it is also a coming-of-age romance and a period film set against themes of economic recession, family discord and school bullying. Director/writer John Carney prefers to call it a 'stealth musical': one that sneaks up on audiences who otherwise might not choose to see a traditional musical. Whatever you call it, this in one of the most engaging and enjoyable films of the year so far.Set in Dublin during the 1980s, this simple story is told through the eyes of 15 year-old Conor whose quarrelling cash-strapped parents move him from an expensive private school to a local parish school. It is a cultural shock and violence from schoolyard thugs and priests are standard fare for a community where drugs, alcohol and beatings are commonplace. He meets alluring but unattainable 16 year-old Raphina who has left school to become a London model and asks her to join his band (which does not exist). The rest of the film traces the formation of his band called Sing Street and its growth from hopeless wannabes to a credible group of musicians. Unlike traditional musicals where dialogue slips into song at the slightest provocation, the music works naturally both in and for the film to underscore the humour and pathos of growing up. The first-time romance runs parallel to the evolving music while Conor's maturing outlook on life helps him rise above the limited opportunities that Dublin offers.Sing Street has no pretensions to thematic originality and it relies entirely on genre-familiar ingredients. But it soars well above its class because of outstanding casting and a brilliant soundtrack. Conor and Raphina are immensely attractive and likable personalities and their remarkable acting range lets them glide effortlessly from precocious youth through adolescent angst to unrestrained exuberance. They are the soul of the film and become as one with its music. The toe-tapping soundtrack includes Duran Duran, Joe Jackson, Hall & Oates, The Jam, The Cure, as well as performances by the Sing Street Band and others, making this is a joyful upbeat film that expresses youth's unshakeable belief in the power of music. This is a great little gem from The Emerald Isle.",8,1,2,10 July 2016
Silence," A monumental story of persecuted faith and colonial conflict.
","The history of humanity is also the story of violence between conflicting belief systems. The worst of it has always existed along the thin dividing lines that separate the religions of the world. These are perhaps the biggest themes that film can portray, overarching the primal emotions of love, hate, and fear. This is the grand stage on which Martin Scorsese's Silence (2016) plays out an historical drama of epic proportions. It is a political treatise on the nature of faith viewed through a post-colonial lens that explores how one belief system sought to impose itself upon another.As complex as its themes are, the film's plot line is simple. Set in 17th century, two Jesuit priests journey from Portugal to Japan in search of their monastery leader who has reportedly renounced his faith. It was a time when every vestige of Christianity was brutally suppressed by Japanese rulers through extensive public renunciations, torture, and executions. The Jesuits find villages of underground Christians who welcome the priests as messiahs. They administer sacred rites and preach to the faithful who believe the path is restored to the kingdom of heaven. The authorities hear of the Christian resurgence but even torture and killings will not force the villagers to betray the priests. They are finally captured and their choice is to renounce their faith or be forced to watch more killings.Up to this point in the story it is a sweeping narrative of bold adventurism, religious persecution, and richly detailed contrasts between Christian and Oriental cultures. Two hours into the story, the film turns into a psychological thriller when the surviving Jesuit comes face-to-face with the renounced mentor he once revered. The dialogue of this meeting is some of the most existentially challenging commentary upon the nature of faith you will find on film. In portraying the immense chasm between apostate and disciple, the film explores the arrogance of religious colonialism; the interplay of personal ego, faith and self-sacrifice; and the incompatibility of two culturally divergent belief systems. The final chapter of the film provides the narrative space in which the Jesuit must confront his god and himself.By its nature, this is a polarising film. It is criss-crossed with political and religious dogma and the history of colonial conquest. It is rich in Christian metaphor, with several scenes evoking the Passions of Christ, the Crucifixion, and the nature of sin and salvation. Some audiences will view it through the lens of their own religious beliefs, but most will recognise this as a monumental Scorsese work. At two hours and forty minutes it requires investment and some will find the pace uneven. Even here, metaphors are at work as the compression and de-compression of time mimics the tides of religious history. As similar stories could be told in different lands, some might find the portrait of cruelty in Japanese history one-sided. But there is no doubting that this is masterful storytelling with a fine cast and stunning cinematography that offers provocative insights into the nature of faith.",8,0,1,26 February 2017
La La Land," A beautifully filmed dazzling retro musical about young dreams.
","It is a great loss to modern cinema that the most escapist of all film genres, the Hollywood- Broadway musical, has been presumed buried for decades. Born in an era of world wars and depression, the musical was the most effective happy pill ever invented. Only in the musical could you find the unbridled eruption of emotion expressed through spontaneous song and dance with scant regard for narrative or dialogue and even less for everyday reality. Closely related to the fantasy genre, the Hollywood musical has resurfaced in modern hybrids but the traditional form exists only in libraries and memories. That is, until you see La La Land (2016).The opening scenes are a perfect example of old fashioned musical showbiz, driven entirely by spectacle rather than logic. High on a Los Angeles freeway a young woman jumps out of her traffic-jammed car and bursts into song and dance. She is copied by scores of other motorists all gyrating in sync, filmed from above, in a single take. A boy and a girl make eye contact (not in a nice way) and this is where the story begins. Mia (Emma Stone) spends her days humiliated by repeatedly missing out on auditions for her 'big chance' in Hollywood, while Sebastian (Ryan Gosling) is a surly dreamer who wants to open a jazz club for people who love jazz. It's not a good start for romance, but a pre-dawn song and dance routine – a la Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers – sets them up for love. This is a story about dreamers and the dream factory, carried aloft by music and generously wrapped in nostalgia.Beneath it all there is a narrative but it feels inconsequential to the music. The bitter-sweet romance is harmonic scaffold for songs and dance that lift you with promises and hopes then land you onto the soft sands of life's disappointments. The characters of Mia and Sebastian are not developed in great depth because they are avatars for generations of dreamers who have been drawn like moths to fame. Their synergy is palpable.This film is full of memorable moments. The scene where Sebastian talks passionately about the dynamics of jazz musicianship is captivating; the moonlight walks through the city are surreal; and the final scene against a painfully hesitant piano solo of 'City of Stars' will squeeze tears out of anyone – and then make you hum the melody for days.Great cinematography is not unusual these days but the La La Land camera is like an artist's brush that composes beautiful portraits against stunning urban landscapes in colour palettes that are richly retro yet totally modern. This is a film to bathe yourself in, let its exuberance, musicality, and nonsensical scenes of flyaway romance dazzle you. Today's world needs more la la land.",8,2,8,10 December 2016
Snowden," bio-pic thriller about a principled romantic and modest hero
","Director Oliver Stone took a risk in making Snowden (2016). Not because of America's continuing legal vendetta against exiled Edward Snowden but because the definitive film about Snowden was already made in the multi-award winning documentary CitizenFour (2014). However, Stone's film goes beyond the act of whistle-blowing to explore who Snowden is and why he leaked. To do this, Stone incorporates the making of the 2014 documentary into his bio-pic thriller and adds a romantic back story to humanise the computer geek.The Snowden plot line consists of known facts and a liberal dose of creative dramatisation. It is focused on the several days during which Snowden (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) was holed up in a Singapore Hotel with journalists while legal clearances were obtained for media publication of his massive leak of classified NSA intelligence. During this time, there are several flashbacks to different points in Snowden's career that trace his progression from a rising star in the intelligence industry to his disillusionment about America's surveillance of enemies and ordinary citizens. While the Snowden story unfolds, the CitizenFour documentary is happening in the same hotel room, a clever device that adds authenticity. The flashbacks include scenes that could have been lifted from Eye in the Sky (2016) where American missiles zero-in on humans guided by cell phone signals. Surveillance technology has advanced to the point that almost anyone can be watched through common domestic devices, while agencies like the NSA publicly deny the scale of their spying operations. This is the hypocrisy that radicalised Snowden into blowing the whistle.The clinical facts behind the Snowden story are alarming and their implications are so profound that most people cannot imagine, let alone articulate, what mass surveillance means for the future of democracies around the world. But we are talking cinema not politics, and Snowden tells a great story about an unusual individual. The back-story of his love life softens the narrative without melodrama and provides relief from the film's density of forensic detail. The two and a quarter hour long film could have been trimmed without harming the narrative but the acting and directing sustains the thriller edge of the story. Whether Stone's portrait appears too saintly or overly supportive of petitions to pardon Snowden is a matter of judgement. In any case, this is a well- made and engaging film that presents Snowden as a principled romantic and modest hero.",7,3,10,25 September 2016
Don't Breathe," its all been done before but this one nails it for steadily escalating tension and sustained terror
","Two hallmarks of the horror-slasher genre are that we always take the victim's side and that we are cool with people dying multiple times. It's a genre that uses standard fear formulas like good and bad guys trapped in dark enclosed spaces, maybe a mad dog thrown in or an evil old man with awesome strength. The genre-bending Don't Breathe (2016) carves out new space by making everyone a victim and adding enough surprises and high-tension atmospherics to keep you stuck on the edge of your seat.Three break-and-enter thugs decide to target the isolated home of a blind Army vet (Stephen Lang) to steal the big payout he received after the death of his daughter. The stereotypes are the usual mix: the gal who wants enough money to stop stealing, the guy who is scared of everything, and the psychotic one who we don't see for very long. The rest of the story is full of well-worn slasher tropes: the blind vet still has elite combat skills, the scared guy is always heading for the door, but the blond gal endures the worst. Like most horrors, males are dispatched quickly while women must endure prolonged helpless panic for the cinematic enjoyment of the male gaze. When all the doors are locked and the lights go out, it's a level playing field in the rambling old house that the blind man navigates by touch, smell and hearing. The basement is full of surprise and that darn dog has more combat tricks than you could imagine. In terms of plot, it has all been done before but this one nails it for steadily escalating tension and sustained terror.There are enough genre innovations to make this film interesting but what really stands out is the filming, soundtrack and lighting. Nervy hand-held camera-work pokes into closets and runs down hallways, always capturing eyes fully dilated. The vet is the star actor while the thugs all over-act their parts, although there is minimal dialogue as whispers or breathing reveals where you are. Like all horrors, the lighting is scary low but when it switches to infra-red everyone is as blind as the vet while the soundtrack finds notes that tingle your brain. The cast are amazingly resilient as they are slashed for most of eighty-three minutes and recycling the not-quite-dead can be wearying. Although not a great fan of the genre, this one had my attention right up to its formulaic ending.",7,1,4,7 September 2016
The Shape of Water," a luscious production of an unoriginal fairy tale
","Auteurism is a key part of filmmaking mythology that leads us to view a film more favourably because of its director, actors, or cinematographer. Sight unseen, any film directed by Guillermo del Toro will attract superlatives like 'masterpiece', and such labels are now all over the sci-fi fantasy The Shape of Water (2017). It can be lonely for anyone to write against this tide.Also described as an adult fairy tale, the story is set in a top-secret research facility during the 1960s Cold War. Mute cleaner Elisa (Sally Hawkins) lives alone in a small apartment above a movie theatre and lives a life of dreams and fantasy. As an introverted fringe-dweller she gravitates to other outliers, like her closeted gay neighbour Giles (Richard Jenkins) and her best friend and workmate Zelda (Octavia Spencer), an African-American who is also Elisa's sign language translator. Elisa's yearning for romance is answered when an amphibian monster is wheeled into the facility inside a water tank. The monster and Elisa form an immediate emotional bond and Elisa is determined to save him from the sadistic director Colonel Strickland (Michael Shannon). When the monster is scheduled for dissection Elisa and friends hatch a high-risk escape plan, with the increasingly deranged Colonel in hot pursuit.This is a luscious production full of Gothic foreboding, dreamy underwater atmospherics, and repressed sexual desire. The kitsch retro laboratory evokes 60s sci-fi spoofs with a heavily saturated other-worldly colour palette. It is not a spectacular or even original set design nor is the monster convincing or scary. Like Elisa, he is mute and his aquatic outfit is little more elaborate than a party costume with big holes to let his lovable eyes shine through. In case we doubt who is the bad guy, the Colonel is the only one with a disintegrating gangrenous limb to signify the moral decay of male authority. Whatever narrative nuance exists is found in novel twists on the Beauty and the Beast fairy tale template where our heroine finds eternal love in a most unusual way. With neither the monster nor the narrative especially original, it is Sally Hawkins alone who holds our attention all the way to the story's implausible ending. As she did so beautifully in Maudie (2017), Hawkins has a unique expressive talent for portraying firm resolve with fragile vulnerability.All fairy tales have a message, although some are more obscure than others. Unlike the thematic cohesiveness of the brilliant Pans Labyrinth (2006), del Toro has left The Shape of Water wide open for interpretation and many are applauding its ambiguity. However, like a Rorschach test, what you see depends on what is going on inside your head, whether it's the pain of 'otherness' or the yearning for love, mystery, excitement, or escape. Which returns us to the label 'masterpiece': if you are looking for one, you will find it. Others will be more moderately entertained with an engaging adult fairy tale that has more than enough charm for a full film of enjoyment.",7,2,4,21 January 2018
Steve Jobs," An unexpectedly unflattering and melodramatic portrait of a tortured soul
","The biopic film is a sub-genre that focuses on the life story of a significant person and usually aims to immortalise, celebrate, document or, in some cases, demonise them or their achievements. As the creative genius behind one of the most successful enterprises on the planet, the late Steve Jobs stood at the epicentre of some of the greatest technological changes seen in the last century. Yet this film is not about achievements or technology at all. While the narrative is framed by three key product launches that shaped the destiny of Apple Inc., it is an unexpectedly unflattering and melodramatic portrait of a tortured soul. Frequent references to his adoption as a child, his need for a surrogate father, and the denial of his own daughter, makes this a story of a little boy lost who grew up to be a man he did not like.Michael Fassbinder gives a powerful performance as Jobs and the lack of narrative action is made up for with plenty of flashbacks and fast-paced dialogue, often with several people at once, to create a cacophony of emotional noise to reflect the inner world of Steve Jobs. The portrait is not nice and many will see the film as one to bury Caesar, not to praise him. Fassbinder's ability to portray manic arrogance and genius at the same time makes for compelling viewing. He permits short sharp glimpses of suppressed emotional confusion, even warmth, whenever Jobs is with his daughter Lisa, but this is contrasted by arrogant insensitivity towards everyone else around him.The whole film is an immersive emotional high-wire act, with Lisa and Apple the two anchors of Jobs' life. The cinematography is part of the message, with many shots of Jobs taken from low angles to make him appear larger than life, a messiah of techno-art and design, a man who not only saw the future but created it. In the final scenes his abrupt and corny conversion into the kind of father who smiles at his daughter rings hollow, but otherwise this is an engaging tale of a flawed human who was both hero and villain to those who knew him best.",7,0,0,11 February 2016
Joker," A unique portrait of mental illness.
","If you have been avoiding the movie Joker (2019) because you think it belongs to the superhero genre and the violent world of masked crusaders then you are making a mistake. Just like I did. Set aside preconceptions and see what is one of the most powerfully introspective portraits of mental illness you will ever find on film - and Batman is nowhere to be seen.Set in Gotham City in the recent pre-digital age, the story opens with Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) struggling to live a normal life, hold a job, and care for his ageing mother. Abused as a child, he relies on medication for his cocktail of mental disorders, the most prominent of which is a condition where anxiety can trigger bursts of hysterical laughter (Pseudobulbar Affect). City Hall cuts back on support services and Arthur's untreated conditions escalate as he becomes more vulnerable to abuse, loses his job, and his dream of becoming a stand-up comic is cruelly exploited. With nothing to gain or lose, all that is left is vengeance.
This plotline is merely a narrative framework for what is a phenomenal performance by Phoenix. His chiselled features, balletic body language, and elastic facial contortions have extraordinary power to express disconnectedness from the material world. As he endures the torments of an uncaring society, we become immersed in his value system where violence makes perfect sense.The film was always going to generate controversy for its depiction of violence. However, it remains on the 'art' side of gratuitous and is more restrained than so many other violent but non-controversial films. The soundtrack and cinematography are edgy, and the camerawork is often so close to Arthur you can see the pores of his skin sweating fury at those around him. The film is visually engrossing: the sets ooze gothic decay, dystopian chaos, and streets full of vagrants and the dispossessed. The film's two-hour running time feels like one.Phoenix single-handedly drives this film and he deserves critical acclaim. It was risky to bypass the usual magical fantasy of super-heroes and super-villians and take a serious look at a serious issue. Entertainment can be a powerful platform for education. While the script retains the tropes of Marvel Comics, it shows insight into mental illness with lines like 'What do you get when you cross a mentally ill loner with a society that abandons him and treats him like trash? What you deserve'.",9,5,7,28 December 2019
The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society," a tale of friendship, romance, and love of literature
","There are so many levels on which one can enjoy the curiously titled The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (2018)that describing the film is a challenge. Like many British period dramas, it has an epic quality in how it reflects on the world as it was in the 1940s. Sumptuously filmed and beautifully acted, it blends historical insight into a finely-crafted tale of mystery and romance.Other than history buffs, most people would be unaware that German troops occupied the British Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey in 1940-45. Many Island children were evacuated to England just prior to the occupation and the invasion encountered virtually no military resistance. Under Nazi rule, many Islanders were sent to forced labour and concentration camps in Germany and all farm produce was confiscated for military use. The film opens with a group of Islanders out after curfew, having enjoyed an illicit roast pig and home-brewed gin even though strict food rationing was in place. Facing immediate arrest, they concoct an excuse about being members of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society who have been enriching their minds while feeding on potato peels, as the Fuhrer would want. From this serendipitous moment, a local tradition is born.Switching to 1946, we meet Juliet Ashton (Lily James) a successful writer living comfortably in London and pondering ideas for her next book. Pursued by a wealthy American suitor, she enjoys the giddy glamour of a British high society that is rebuilding after the war. A letter from a member of the Guernsey Literary Society excites her interest and she soon travels to the Island to learn more. She becomes enchanted with its idyllic village life and rural tranquillity and how each member of the Society has their own wartime story to tell. There is also a new romance simmering where least expected, as well as guarded secrets and strong resistance to a book being written about them.This simple plotline understates the multiple sub-stories that are a montage of war-time Guernsey, including dark themes of Nazi collaboration, the trauma of children separated from families, and uplifting themes about how literature can bring people together across time and space. The original novel on which the film is based was framed around letters between Juliet and Society members, so the film's timeframes shift frequently but with seamless continuity. There are several charming exchanges about writers and novels that you would expect from lovers of literature. The filming aesthetic evokes the era with authenticity, while Lily James and the ensemble cast are superb.Some might say that this story is told through a soft-focus lens, mediated through the gentility of Juliet's privileged life and self-indulgent curiosity about the lives of others. That may be so, but her narrative perspective accentuates the world of difference between war-time London and Guernsey. Without such insights, the story would be just a warm-hearted melodrama. But the film offers much more than that. It is an engaging detective story, a study of survival under wartime occupation, and a tale of friendship, romance, and love of literature.",8,122,135,25 April 2018
"Hail, Caesar!"," This is an hilarious take on 'the Hollywood dream'.
","It is easy to take Hail, Caesar! (2016) as just a thoroughly enjoyable lightweight comedy. But there is much more to this film if you understand the dark history of the Hollywood studio system of the 1920s – 1960s and its demise after a USA Supreme Court found that it breached competition law. The phrase 'genre factory' alludes to that era when big production companies owned permanent movie lots, actors, sets, distribution networks and even cinemas. In common use 'genre factory' is the opposite of 'art-house' and Hollywood has always been sensitive about its reputation for mass- produced formulaic movies while independent art-houses are credited for innovative aesthetic works. Read in this context, Hail, Caesar! steps back for a huge laugh at the studio system and its legacy.The storyline is based on a day in the life of a Hollywood executive, Eddie Mannix (Josh Brolin) as he moves between scenes of various movies in production. Juggling several films at once, his job is to make sure that the big-name stars are happy and their public image remains wholesome. A staunch Catholic, he struggles with guilt over his promise to quit smoking and goes to confession every day. Across its sprawling film lots, we see scenes from a western, a period drama, a sailor dance/musical, a synchronised swimming spectacle, and the 'big' biblical epic Hail, Caesar! Things go awry when the epic's star, Baird Whitlock (George Clooney) is kidnapped by a madcap group of disaffected scriptwriters and communists, a side-story that lampoons the Cold War communist peril depicted more seriously in Trumbo (2015). While sorting out the missing Whitlock, he also deals with the embarrassing pregnancy of his unmarried aquatic star whose swimming costume no longer fits; wards off irritating twin-sister gossip columnists who threaten scandal scoops; and mentors a hapless trick-riding Western star who must learn to speak in a drama film. It's a mashup style of pastiche comedy that both celebrates and mocks Hollywood genres and movie icons.This is an hilarious take on 'the Hollywood dream'. The camera overhead and behind-the-scene shots on different sets is the Coen Brothers' way of self-reflectively reminding audiences of Hollywood's unbroken power to fabricate the illusions that are the very essence of the movie industry. Honest fixer Mannix symoblises the manic faith in schmaltzy escapism, the opiate for the masses, produced abundantly in the citadel of capitalism and so loved around the world.",7,1,3,16 March 2016
Arrival," spindly aliens arrive, we discover they have circular memory, America saves the planet again.
","Ever since the silent film A Trip to the Moon was shown in 1902 audiences have turned to Science Fiction for creative images of life beyond earth. Some Sci-Fi's emphasise alien threats, their appearance, or their technology. The film Arrival (2016) takes a different approach by looking at the challenges of language when first contact is made. Under a thick layer of American propaganda, the film also offers a sermon about global cooperation.The central storyline is simple: twelve huge elliptical extra-terrestial objects arrive on earth and hover just above ground level in twelve locations across the globe. While each nation carries out its own threat assessments, the Americans opt to explore how to communicate with the visitors rather than default to military options. Our heroine is accomplished linguist Louise Banks (Amy Adams) who leads a team assigned to enter the spacecraft and assess if humans can communicate with the visitors. Paired with physicist Ian Donnelly (Jeremy Renner) they represent the soft and hard faces of science. When contact is made with the tentacled aliens via a glass-like wall it becomes evident that dialogue is possible using a form of circular symbols.Global panic erupts when linguistic trial and error decodes a symbol for 'weapon' and China prepares to attack even though Louise believes the translation is ambiguous. In the midst of the crisis, she is haunted by visions of her daughter who died of a rare disease. The visions gradually transition from memories to predictions. Unlike human linear memory the aliens have circular memory that connects the past, present and future. Her flashbacks and flash-forwards are the key to understanding the film but they add a layer of narrative confusion in the process.The film's unsurprising message is that when alien contact occurs the future of the planet will depend on global cooperation. This theme is packaged inside a story that is told with digital effects that are modest by today's standards. Some will feel let down by the unimaginative spindly alien forms that are kept at a hazy distance within the concrete bunker-like spaceship setting. The back- story of Louise's personal life is a distracting melodrama and the concept of memory circularity is a weak idea on which to base the plot. That the Hollywood dream-factory makes America the global saviour again is not new. Unlike other visually ground-breaking Sci-Fi's this one is more about ideas than spectacle. But it is a thought-provoking film about the technology of language and it works well at this level.",7,0,8,19 November 2016
Parasite," A black comedy on social inequality
","There is no shortage of films that depict the injustice of social inequality but originality is scarce. With a large proportion of its population below the poverty line, it is noteworthy that a filmmaker from South Korea has produced a work that has attracted almost universal acclaim. Parasite (2019)generates a great deal of conversation but be warned: it is not a film for everyone, especially those averse to gory endings.If you step back from the story's twists and turns, the narrative premise is simple. A family of petty crooks living in abject poverty get lucky as, one by one, each tricks their way into being employed by the same heartlessly wealthy family in roles like tutor, driver, and housekeeper. The gullible family is easy to deceive, while the crooks manufacture various scenarios to their own advantage. The occupation of the luxurious home by the crooks adds a new meaning to the concept of home invasion. However, the plan comes un-stuck when they find a secret dungeon that leads to horrific consequences.The film takes too much time in developing the central premise and various sub-plots, and more descriptive prose could be offered here about what actually happens. But that is not the point of the film. Director Joon-ho Bong paints an intricate portrait of the normalisation of poverty and class privilege, with both sets of family never questioning their place in South Korea's social order. This acceptance and its destructiveness of the human spirit makes change impossible and condemns Korean society to moral bankruptcy.There is more to this film than political discourse. As a black comedy, it is sprinkled with funny although improbable moments and the filming style expresses the polemic in obvious ways. Juxtaposing the world occupied by a smelly cramped underclass with the opulent world of the rich is low-hanging fruit. One can also find elements of magical fantasy, as it requires an unequivocal suspension of disbelief to accept that a family of losers can so easily dupe a family of high achievers. The acting tends towards wooden, and it is difficult to warm to any particular character. The film's climax offers little other than an ambivalent balance between hope and nihilism, leaving viewers to decide which family are the parasites.For many, the critical pendulum swings towards the 'masterpiece' label. But it is perhaps closer to reality to describe this as an original, engaging, and disturbing tale of endemic class tension, oppression, and helplessness. Although tenuous, the message has universal relevance.",8,82,137,28 December 2019
Marriage Story," A witty and sad portrait of modern marriage
","It is refreshing to see a film that can both warmly respect and ruthlessly dissect the institution of marriage. While every marriage is unique, there are universal scenarios that can signal their demise. Two of these are central to Marriage Story (2019): the film forensically examines what happens when one partner's ego swallows another, then shows the destructive force that is unleashed when lawyers come between otherwise still-caring partners.The storyline is simple, linear, and dialogue-heavy. In the opening minutes we see respected theatre director Charlie (Adam Driver) and his increasingly successful actress wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) in the middle of a marital mediation session. He is opening a new play on Broadway while she will be taking their young son to Los Angeles to star in a TV pilot. The session stalls despite their obvious regard for each other and their commitment to avoid lawyers in a marriage split.Classic marital tension lines become palpably clear. Charlie and Nicole met when he was a high-profile director and she a theatre novice, and this imbalance of egos remain embedded in all aspects of their relationship. Although a loving father, the self-absorbed Charlie had an affair which is now being weaponised as she asserts her identity and needs. She decides to engage a lawyer forcing him to follow suit or lose custody of their young son; the communication drawbridge is pulled up as the lawyers amplify every marital issue into a war cry on an ever more blood-splattered battlefield.Nothing new here, you might say, except for two bright lights in a dark place: Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson. He is perfect in playing the broad faced deer-in-the-spotlight hapless male, confused over his marital and parental mess-ups...but he sings a beautiful song. She is brilliant in playing a wife no longer willing to be invisible despite still loving the man she married. An ensemble of lawyers include a benignly caring advisor (Alan Alda) and ruthless warriors who take no prisoners (Laura Dern and Ray Liotta).You don't need to be a divorce voyeur to find this well-trodden story highly absorbing, mostly because the two stars make it hard to take sides. Charlie's weaknesses are not unforgiveable and his love for his son and wife continue. Nicole has a right to her own independent future but still feels strongly about him. If lawyers were not involved, things could be very different. Marriage Story is an insightful, witty, and sad portrait of how easily a marital fairytale can turn to a nightmare.",8,5,7,28 December 2019
Mother!," an audacious absurdist masterpiece of political and religious satire
","Art cinema and genre film are often regarded as opposite ends of the movie spectrum. One flaunts filmmaking rules, the other depends on them. When they are blended, the result can be confusing, challenging, and very refreshing. The film Mother! (2017) is an example of a filmmaker deliberately provoking audiences with a multi-genre exploration that defies labelling. Calling this a horror drama does not even come close to describing the way it ramps from a story of domestic abuse to home invasion, demonic possession, messianic madness, and then explodes into a supernatural fantasy of biblical proportions. Be prepared for a wild ride.Talking of plot wrongly implies that the film's narrative is based on logical progression whereas it feels more like a never-ending nightmare. It's held together by imagination not logic. We meet an unnamed couple in a sprawling isolated country mansion: Mother (Jennifer Lawrence) is a young home decorator, and Him (Xavier Bardem) a famous poet whose writing has, like their sex life, dried up. One evening, two people arrive unexpectedly: Man (Ed Harris) is followed later by Woman (Michelle Pfeiffer) and soon the couple are making themselves at home, much to Mother's discomfort. More people arrive and violence erupts among the strangers. The house is cleared, the sex life and poetry resumes, and fame returns. People line up to hear Him speak and the crowds keep getting bigger. Mother becomes a captive in her own house as her tummy swells with new life while the crowds spill into every room. They revere the ground on which Him walks, hang off Him's every word, and souvenir anything they can carry while she is in fixated panic at the disintegration of her world. The crowd's adoration turns to greed, then carnage, while Mother gives birth in a full- scale war zone compressed into a house. The new life is shared among the hordes as the apocalypse descends. It's totally crazy.The originality, absurdism, and audacity of this film are breathtaking. It makes more sense if viewed as a montage of interconnected visual metaphors, loosely assembled according to taste. There are clues that help decode its possibilities. For example, being nameless renders the cast into avatars for universal stereotypes, so the film is not just about a house full of people. History is littered with belief systems and their damage to humanity, while the birth is Mothers' single unifying power that is ripped from her arms in an horrific Biblical allusion to 'feeding of the masses'. The score is virtually non-existent, allowing natural sounds free reign to create a mood of Gothic claustrophobia. The camera-work pulsates with hand-held rhythms and variable depth of field that isolate different planes of psychological and physical reality. The constant camera close-ups on Mother's face or over her shoulder assumes her viewpoint and makes this a feminist experience of a 'man's world'. The casting is perfect. Jennifer Lawrence's youthful Madonna face becomes a powerhouse of depicted terror while Xavier Bardem's turns into a stencilled visage of divinity, a self-absorbed messiah.Whatever else it may be, this film is also a masterpiece of political and religious satire. Completely unbounded, it can be taken as a weird horror film or read as a meditation on gendered existentialism or an absurdist parody on the saviours that arise in every society throughout history. It is also completely here and now: when Him survives the dystopian chaos that he has created, ask yourself: who does he remind you of?",8,5,15,17 September 2017
The Greatest Showman," an original, vibrant, fast paced fantasy musical that raises the bar for the revival of this genre
","If you were impressed with the opening number of La La Land (2017) you will find the start of The Greatest Showman (2017) more electrifying, with high-voltage music charging the entire film. But be warned: some will reject it for not being the original Barnum or because Hugh Jackman is not Michael Crawford or because the film plays loose with history. Ignore the naysayers: if you give in to it as pure entertainment, Showman is an original, vibrant, fast paced fantasy musical that raises the bar for the revival of this genre.In just two musical numbers, the poor boy, P.T. Barnum, meets the well-to-do love of his life Charity, and in a seamlessly compressed time capsule, they grow up, court, elope, start a family, and he sets up a theatre in New York. Barnum turns out to be a natural self-promoter and impresario. He gathers a cast of misfits and fringe-dwellers, including a bearded lady, a dwarf, a tattooed man, the world's fattest, tallest and strongest men; anyone who is different from society's definition of normal. Difference attracts hatred, and critics and protesters are part of Barnum's world, He strives for respectability by recruiting a prominent playwright and a world-class singer but suffers personal and financial setbacks that threaten the circus. Almost defeated by arson, he turns to the canvas tent and reinvents the modern-day circus. As each major scene segues into the next, it is carried forward with a musical number that weaves lyrics, rhythm, and melody to produce dramatic and emotional moments.It is hard to not be swept away by the pace of action, spectacle, and colours of circus life. Far from the vaudeville-inspired Barnum circus music of yesteryear, Showman has the dramatic percussive beats, harmonies, and video-clip choreography of contemporary musicals that reach a new generation. The instantaneous grabbing power of 'The Greatest Show', the punch-the-air assertiveness of 'This is Me', the haunting melodies in 'Never Enough', 'Million Dreams', and 'From Now On', together with six other high-energy numbers create a soundscape that takes you beyond visual realism and into the realm of fantasy. Like all musicals, character and plot are only scaffolds for creating the bigger extravaganza of timeless 'showbiz'. The film's ensemble of diversity, dance, and vocal talent is perfectly matched to its objective of making you tap your feet and leaving you wanting more.More than any other film genre, the fantasy musical is best judged on its total entertainment effect. There are themes relating to the acceptance of social outliers, pride before the fall, and redemptive healing, but this is not a sermon nor is it a factual historical adaptation. If you need an overriding message, the film's theme song shouts unapologetic self-acceptance with 'no more hiding who I want to be...this is me'. Don't be distracted by the plasticity of personality and performance: that's part of all show business. Above all else, this film is fun, fast, and musically delightful. In today's world, we need more like this.",8,1,3,1 January 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Original in conception but a misfire in execution.
","Given the polarisation of opinion about Jojo Rabbit (2019), it would be so much easier not to write this review at all. However, it is incumbent on me to explain why this movie is one of the worst I have seen in years.The trailer captures the narrative essence of this war comedy drama. Jojo (Roman Griffin Davis) is a ten-year old German boy who aspires to be a Nazi killing-machine but his Hitler Youth camp squad nickname him Rabbit because he runs away when ordered to kill one. When he finds Jewish teenager Elsa (Thomasin McKenzie) sheltered in the attic he has the chance to betray her in service of the Fuhrer, but his conscience comes into play.This narrative arc is grounded in a predictable coming of age tale. A magical fantasy device frames the story wherein Jojo has an imaginary friend that only he can see, a campy goofball version of Adolf Hitler (Taika Waititi) who urges him to betray Elsa. With the Allied armies closing in, the German war effort enters its dying days and Jojo must confront Nazi lies.Whether one thinks this film is a comedy or travesty is entirely subjective. Many will laugh at a puerile script delivered in gratingly mangled German accents with incongruous contemporary phrasing. Others may enjoy non-stop dead-pan exchanges, such as Elsa asking 'what am I?', with Jojo answering 'a Jew', to which Elsa replies 'Gesundheit'. Or when a female commandant (Rebel Wilson) tells Nazi girls it's a privilege to serve German soldiers: she has borne eighteen children already so 'it's a great time to be a girl'. Some will even think Jojo's cartoonish Hitler is a credibly funny representation of evil, perhaps unaware of the all-time satirical classic: the goose-stepping John Cleese and his 'don't mention the war' skit. Where Cleese had surgical control of his mockery, Jojo's Hitler sprays cheap one-liners that are cringingly unfunny.It is argued that half of today's generation know very little about Hitler, Nazism, and the Holocaust, so films like this potentially alert us to the dangers of extreme politics. Jojo Rabbit may have worked had it opted for clarity or gravity of purpose; its stellar cast make little difference. It is a mashup of so many genres that any meaningful message is lost, and all is sacrificed to low brow gags. Even the film's most serious moments struggle for respect under the shadow of slapstick, kitsch, and the vain attempt to use stand-up comedy to portray humanity's darkest time. With a climax that mocked my staying power, this film is, at best, original in conception but a misfire in execution.",2,45,102,28 December 2019
Son of Saul," In terms of cinematography, storytelling and emotional impact, this film is a modern masterpiece
","It is 23 years since the multi-award winning Schindler's List (1993) appeared, a critically acclaimed film that is indelibly etched into the memories of millions. The emotional defences of today's audiences are more difficult to penetrate because of the range and intensity of demands upon their finite storage and response capacity. But Son of Saul (2015) does more than penetrate our defences. It takes you by the throat and drags you into a world of unspeakable horror, forcing you to stand just inches from Dante's Inferno but with the spectacle out of focus or just out of frame. This cinematic device forces the viewer to fill in the detail whether they want to or not. When it comes to Holocaust atrocities, the unseeable is more terrifying.The story of Saul is painfully simple: he is a Hungarian Jewish prisoner in Auschwitz, one of a group of wardens who herd other prisoners to the chambers then remove their incinerated remains. In return, they receive extra food, a few more weeks of life, and unimaginable shame. Against the out- of-focus images of furnaces and corpses Saul finds a boy who briefly survives gassing and he becomes obsessed with finding a Rabbi to perform a dignified burial for the body he calls son. But Saul never had a son and his quixotic quest is both an act of madness and a tragic morality play. Against a frenzied, claustrophobic background of horrific screams, gunshots, smoke and body parts, whispers of a planned escape by other prisoners serve only to signal that even in this hell human beings retained hope of survival no matter how futile. In no other film have I experienced such raw visceral power of sound and silence, orchestrated with such brutal force to numb the senses and leave you drained.In terms of cinematography, storytelling and emotional impact, this film is a modern masterpiece. But it is hardly entertainment. It leaves you nowhere to hide, shows no mercy, spares no detail. It uses the camera with extraordinary surgical precision, lingering on pained faces, shifting to a wafer-thin depth of field to isolate Saul from hell, then darting frenetically from face to face in search of humanity. Only one smile appears in all of this film and it rapidly vanishes as the delusion of a madman. Why see such a film? Answers will vary of course. For some, it is about respect for filmmaking at the highest level. For others, it is about the imperative of not forgetting humanity's potential for evil. One thing is certain: the shelf life of this film will be measured in decades.",10,3,9,16 March 2016
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Biggest marketing hoax of 2015
","A simple benchmark for judging the merits of 'the film of the year' is to ask yourself this question: if this film did not have almost 40 years of nostalgia-filled cultural context and cult following, would it be acclaimed as a cinematic masterpiece on its own merits? The answer is an obvious and resounding no. It has a vacuous and incoherent narrative arc, its characters are all tired old cultist clichés, the degree of repetitive 'oh no, they are going to die' followed immediately by 'phew, they escaped' is tiresome and the denouement or nearest thing to a climax offered by the film is straight out of the C-Grade sci-fi bottom drawer. Of course, if the question is: does this film have marvelous visual effects, then the answer is a qualified yes. Very good, but does not cut new ground. As the 16 year old in front me for the quick exit said 'could have made a better film myself'.",5,137,264,20 December 2015
Green Book," a witty comedy drama of 1960s US race relations
","One of the most cliché-filled movies of 2018 is also one of the most endearing. Loaded with road film tropes and framed as a 'journey of two unmatched souls', Green Book (2018)is a male-centric essay on 1960s American racism that resonates today.Rough-neck Italian bouncer Tony Lip (Viggo Mortensen) is out of work at the same time that Black-American virtuoso pianist Dr Don Shirley (Mahershala Ali) wants to hire a driver for a deep South tour. Tony's reputation precedes him, and Dr Shirley knows that the trip will encounter the sort of problems that a man like Tony can handle. Their first meeting is a parody of cultural difference: the haughty high-brow coloured man in a flowing African robe seated on a throne, meets an uncouth, uneducated, and racist Italian whose belligerence promises safety.On-screen text provides city and state milestones for the trip, and the deeper south they drive, the more racial hostility they find. Along the way, Tony's lack of culture slowly responds to the sensitive aesthetic of the acclaimed pianist, while Dr Shirley's arrogance is softened by Tony's connection with what matters to ordinary people (like fried chicken and the music of Little Richard). The Green Book in the film's title actually existed and listed safe accommodation for Black American travellers. They are modest rooms compared with those the Carnegie Hall performer wants, but they are sanctuaries from racial vilification. At other times, the predictable scenarios of humiliation include being honoured for his playing while not being allowed to eat with white people or use their toilets.
The narrative arc is tied to the tour and remains low on dramatic tension or plot twists. This is not an action-rich film, rather it's a two-hander character study that unfolds incrementally through the insightful banter between polar opposite personalities. Tony's regular letters to his wife become a recurring motif of mutual support; they start out with monosyllabic banalities and progress into lyrical prose, coached by the literate musician. They begin to care for each other and, when the tour is over, both are unsurprisingly better people for the experience.The entire weight of this film rests on an intelligently humorous script and sensitive delivery by Viggo Mortensen and Mahershala Ali. With authenticity and emotional nuance, they have synergy that is rare between males from opposites worlds. The meta-message in Green Booklies in the sad necessity that films like this still need to be made to highlight America's tensions with coloured and culturally different people. The echoes are deafening, with films like BlacKkKlansman(2018)and If Beale Street Could Talk (2018) joining the chorus. Green Booksays more about today than the era it depicts.",8,1,1,18 February 2019
Joy," Too many distractions that limit the film's potential.
","There is so much to like and so much to dislike in Joy (2015). It offers intriguing and unflattering insights into the business ethics and inner workings of television's high-volume shopping channels, but the novelty dims as the pretty-housewife-turns-mega-entrepreneur story gives way to your standard 'anyone can be President' soap, and with a mop would you believe. The acting is sharp, controlled, and often humorous in a downtown Bronx kind of way, and the regular sideshows into feminine vulnerabilities and strengths ensures Joy has a place on the shelves of feminist film, but only just.There are too many distractions that limit the film's potential to provide insight into the human spirit under extreme adversity. If Joy were Jim or some other male the story would flop like her mops, so it rests entirely on the shoulders of the implacable Jennifer Lawrence to make us see beyond the film's clichés about the crushing effects of American capitalism on the individual. The American Rifle Association must have leapt for Joy when she admits to feeling better after shooting a few rounds to relieve her pent-up anger about male treachery and being told go home to tend the family. Overall, this is an entertaining, if somewhat clichéd story of feminine triumphalism in the fabricated-value world of television commerce.",6,1,3,11 February 2016
Hacksaw Ridge," one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema
","Good war-films can be very disturbing to watch. The dramatic realism of modern digital effects spares little and many audiences will find Hacksaw Ridge (2016) one of the most violent sensory assaults that can be experienced in a cinema. If it were not a true story that celebrates an unusual hero the film could have been accused of a gratuitous display of unrelenting carnage and military triumphalism.The film plays in two halves: the early life and romance of Army Medic Desmond Doss (Andrew Garfield) and the actual Battle of Hacksaw Ridge. Raised in bible best Virginia, Doss had a troubled upbringing under an abusive father. A devout Seventh-day Adventist, he swore never to commit violence or even carry a weapon but felt duty-bound to enlist in the Army. Not long after meeting the one love of his life, nurse Dorothy Schutte (Teresa Palmer), he enlisted with the belief that he could serve his God unarmed and without killing enemy soldiers.Branded a coward and bullied to leave, he was eventually granted conscientious objector status and became one of the troops sent to capture Hacksaw Ridge in the Battle of Okinawa of May 1945. While the assault was forced to retreat under overwhelming enemy fire, Doss remained behind and single-handedly evacuated 75 casualties, lowering them by rope from an escarpment over 100 metres high. The Ridge was eventually captured and Doss became one of the most decorated heroes of World War II.The heroism depicted in this story is of such an extraordinary magnitude that it can easily overwhelm any consideration of the film's merits. With an uncomplicated and factual narrative arc, the story rests on two pillars: acting and filming. On both scores, this film deserves high praise. While the early life and romance chapter drifts towards melodrama, Garfield is cast to perfection as the wide-eyed and straight talking man of unshakeable principle and Palmer convincingly plays his adorable emotional anchor. Together with a strong support cast that includes several big-name stars, this is a powerful ensemble that carries the story convincingly.The most outstanding element of this film, however, is its powerhouse hyper-realistic cinematography and spectacular set constructions that relentlessly convey the brutality of war. While it is an outstanding technical production, giving spectacle precedence over narrative is the film's Achilles Heel. One or maybe a few helmeted heads shredded or bodies bayonetted can convey much, but twenty deadens the senses. If ever there was a case where less could have been more, this is it. Otherwise this is a gripping film with forceful storytelling about a remarkable war hero.",8,127,196,18 October 2016
Me Before You," a beautifully sugar-coated but tragic story with a deep message that increasingly demands a societal response
","In movies, as in life, appearances can be deceptive. The trailer for Me Before You (2016) promises a sweet romantic comedy but the film is an emotionally challenging confrontation with the moral dilemmas of assisted dying. It is a beautifully sugar-coated but tragic story with a deep message that increasingly demands a societal response. Full of fairy-tale allusions, including a castle with a fallen prince and a poor girl in strange clothes, together with brilliant casting and tear-inducing imagery, the film is one of a growing number that address euthanasia themes.The storyline is simple. Working class girl Louisa Clark (Emilia Clarke) takes a six-month contract to be a carer for quadriplegic Will Traynor (Sam Claflin). He is under the guardianship of his wealthy parents who want a fresh bright face for Will, and Louisa is delightfully quirky, chatty and absolutely zany in her dress sense. Despite a fractious beginning, they soon become deeply attached as she learns of his plan to end his life in a Swiss euthanasia clinic within six months. In the time they have left and within the constraints of his condition, they do many of the things that young lovers do, including a tropical island holiday. The most painful part of this film is the absolutely finite nature of its impending finale and the respectful resolution shown in particular by Will's parents and the transformative effect this has on Louisa.Emilia Clarke's performance is the beating heart of this film. As Louisa, she is simply beyond gorgeous. Her face can speak volumes without opening her mouth while her eyebrows alone have a vocabulary spanning all human emotion. Will is her perfect match, with an expressiveness that glides seamlessly from brooding stoicism to irascible charm. No doubt many audiences will be happy to enjoy a bitter sweet love story told well, without dwelling on the deeper message of assisted dying. Others, however, will be struck by the force of three words that are repeated several times in the film, 'it's his choice'. They will grapple with how a person can reach such an unbearable point in their existence where they find absolutely no reason to live. As a tear-jerker rom-com, this film is right up there with the best of them but it is so much more than that. Sure, the narrative arc is laid bare right from the start, but sometimes you just have to let a movie have its way with you, as this one did with me.",8,2,4,15 June 2016
Sully," masterful storytelling and a thoroughly riveting film
","True story bio-pics based on real disasters have little room for creativity because a major aviation incident like landing in the Hudson River is so forensically documented. However, the real disaster in Sully (2016) is not landing a plane in a freezing river, but the hysteria of the media, airlines, insurance companies and safety investigators, who all voraciously pursued their own vested interests by undermining the professionalism of a modest pilot who saved the lives of everyone on board.The central incident unfolds only minutes after take-off on 19 January 2009 when Captain Sullenberger (Tom Hanks) realises that his Airbus A320-214 has lost both engines on hitting a massive flock of Canada geese. His options were to glide back for an airport landing while losing altitude over a densely populated city, or go for an unprecedented water landing onto the Hudson. His decision made history and he was immediately lauded as a hero until the media's appetite for the dark side of humanity turned the incident into a witch-hunt. Asking was he a 'hero or fraud', the really big doubters were those with most to gain if human error could be established. While aviation interests quickly pitted computer simulations against real world decision making, Sully remained focused on cockpit logic. The film spends most of its 93 minutes exploring the incident from different perspectives and director Clint Eastwood's masterful storytelling is a perfect mix of facts and human insight.It is hard to imagine any actor who could fill this role as well as Tom Hanks. He captures the understated gravitas of a modest hero whose job exists at the fleeting intersection between saving and losing lives. The filming style draws you into its vortex while being mercifully light on CGI effects. We watch over Sully's shoulder at the controls then study his face during the critical minutes, before switching to panoptic views from the clouds. The most outstanding feature of this film is the way it frames the narrative and its aftermath, with flashbacks and parallel sub-plots that piece the story together like an elaborate jigsaw puzzle. Disaster films are usually just action dramas, but this one is much more than that. It has the intensity of a psychological thriller as we watch Sully's own confidence being undermined in the battle between sterile computer algorithms and the kind of intuitive judgement that comes from four decades of flying. This is a thoroughly riveting film.",8,2,4,11 September 2016
