The Blair Witch Project," Save Your Money. You Can't Say I Didn't Warn You.
","This movie was a waste of time. I went into it 'cold', never having paid any attention to the hype about it (I've just discovered the hype now, because I went looking for it) and never having read any reviews of it. I admire originality, don't expect or admire gore, and am capable of appreciating experimental filmmaking. The movie was boring, confusing, and lacking in payoff. You won't miss anything if you go to the bathroom. That's all.",1,0,2,31 July 1999
The Green Mile," More than Meets the Eye--Don't Miss This One!
","This is an excellent adaptation of a novel, far better than most adaptations. I've been to see it 4 times (I'm not usually that type) and each time the audience is larger and more expressive. Full burst of applause at the end, as at a play. Too bad there's no curtain call, because everyone is great. This movie, I'm afraid, is going to get ripped off at the Oscars. I've seen many excellent movies this year, but this is the best.Watch for the little things. ([1] I think the last line of the movie is an 'in' joke. [2] Del assumes a Jesus-crucified position as his mouse runs across his shoulders. [3] John refers to God specifically as 'God the Father'; there is more than a hint that he himself represents the Son, whose initials {and, in some cases, abilities} he shares. [4] Check out the names on the tombstones at Elaine's funeral. [5] Old Paul's teacup is one of a set that he and his wife had in the 30s. [6] Melinda gives John a St. Christopher medal; St. Christopher is supposed to have carried Christ to safety once. [7] Hammersmith, an unsympathetic observer of the early part of John's ordeal, has a name that suggests preparation for crucifixion. No doubt there's more!)",10,2,2,10 January 2000
