Angels & Demons," Ultra-closeups, special effects, editing: not much fun anymore
","Greetings -- Good expectation for a good bit of entertainment and perhaps even some edification. But... Just another darn night at the mega-theater, putting up with utterly atrocious previews of coming attractions. Both the previews and what they preview. If a coming attraction has quality, it's lost in this piling on of excess. I cringe and talk to myself and 'whoever' in a mutter of high dissatisfaction. I pull my cap down. And I make me another promise to show up late next time. Swoosh!! Edit fast faster fastest. Swooosh! Disdain for the viewer. Swoooosh! Woosh! Distortions. Don't they suppose anyone with taste goes to movies anymore? Is that why movie makers do this to us? Why not have some regard for youthful intelligence and taste, too? Give us ALL some. Oh, well. Oh, Hell! -- Enough. It's on with the feature, and I take off my cap. -- Film language. The editing, the kind used during features, also comes near to hurting Angels and Demons. Closeups are vastly over used. Sure, they aid the ability to give us special effects. And that's part of the hurt -- special effects overused. --Let's try the plot and the film language which tells it. One review puts it like this: '... and Howard's excellence in directing ... make this film so superb. It also lies in the simple things that keep characters like Hanks true to life....' --OK, I can certainly buy that about Actor Tom, but not this example: '... with his wearing of a simple Mickey Mouse watch ....' --My guess is that Director Ron has so few chances for comic relief, he has to use this trite edit and 1 or 2 others. As we exited, a couple ready to enter asked. I said, 'Oh, OK. It's a commercial about religion.' And I was thinking about a lot more, including: --There are many Catholics and religious literalists in our world, and Hollywood wants their ticket money, too. So let's not offend. Wrap it up kinda like the end of Singin' in the Rain so's we wanna feel good and come back.",4,1,3,14 June 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," The girlfriends and wives of Henry VIII - and the children of same
","Many are the attempts to tell the wide and deep story of England's talented but power-spoiled Henry VIII and his wives. The intrigue and the ramifications for Europe and the Christian religion are the 'wide and deep' of it. This one rates well for acting, costumes, and scenery. Its flaw is in the concept of limiting it to the Boleyn family. That should have been its strength. Something doesn't go right. The skips and jumps, the telescoping in transitions may be the culprit. That's a director's job, and that of his staff. If it were to be otherwise, the story takes more care and not 115 minutes as is allowed here, but about twice that. It has been done. A series. This cast could have been a good one for that re-effort. Portman and Johannson are excellent as the Boleyn sisters. Their ambitious and doomed father and uncle are done very well. And King Henry's actor has the figure and face that could be aged unto his death, shall I say, comforted by his sixth wife. It would then take another few hours to tell the story of the daughter of Anne and Henry, Elizabeth I. History demands this to be told many times, probably each generation. Henry's father, Henry VII, was the last English king to win his title on a battlefield, at Bosworth in 1485, defeating Richard III. It would be good to see the story from that point. It could be carried through to Shakespeare and beyond Elizabeth to James I. Therefore, from 1485 to the earliest part of 1600. That would be something to shoot for. I wanted to see 'The Other Boleyn Girl' and did so over a 2.5 hour stretch with 45 minutes of TV commercials. Interruptions were every 10 to 15 minutes, and the ads were a jumble of nothingness as several were stacked without consideration for whatever part of the plot is chopped into. That's what TV has become: the greatest salesman ever invented, and yet powerless to do much beyond brand-naming. It may well be the goose that laid the golden egg but is cut open in greed to find them all -- so greed will kill it. Television is not an entertainment medium so much as it is an advertising medium. Rent the movie for a better experience and a chance to appreciate.",7,0,0,12 March 2011
The Dark Knight," The Knight is Dark and He is Far (sort of) From Home
","It takes a ton to put this plot into words. (As we see in so many printed for this opportunity.) Complicated / Complex won't even suffice for starters. The theme has plenty going for it. The film is maybe 33 minutes too long so that the point or points are nearly drowned. And what does the job is overdone special effects. AGAIN! When will we learn to fore-go that stuff, which is to please the juveniles of any age in the seats, so that an idea can gain traction! Somewhere down the line of years someone will edit this for the smaller home screen, if any of those remain when advertising has once again sold us too much for self-gratification. Then the mind will be able to concentrate on the paradox of ideas in The Dark Knight, and we might be the richer for that good deed.",Null,1,1,15 September 2011
