Insidious: Chapter 2," The horror of horrible
","Insidious 2 is everything its prequel was, but less in every way. The story suffered more, and the cheap shock drops were more abundant. It plays off a good idea but is poorly executed. Insidious 2 is another drop in the sea of forgettable horror films. James Wan definitely has his own style, and whilst it worked for Saw, it could not help this dying film with life. Patrick Wilson is predictable in his character, whilst Rose Byrne's character is in a constant state of terror, shock, and unstable irrationality. It should go without saying that the acting by both is below average at best. The true horror of this film is that there are sequels made, and more to come.",2,2,3,13 February 2017
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Cute and understandably 'nice'
","The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great screen adaptation by an incredibly gifted author, screenwriter, and director; Stephen Chbosky. He has masterfully brought enjoyment, and a feeble attempt of depth, to a story of a teenager coming to terms with himself. Played by Logan Lerman, the main story driver, the audience is exposed to a wild ride of emotions, and vulnerable situations. Emma Watson, the star capture of the movie, brings little to the plate, and seems replaceable. Regardless, it tries very hard to make sense of life's hard lessons, and is willing to breach the taboo lines. The Perks of being a Wallflower is a dramatically cute story.",7,0,1,11 February 2017
Balls of Fury," A walking corpse of a film
","Balls of Fury is an attempt at greatness but falls flat, mostly due to the shamble-creating Don Fogler. His comedic style constantly stays in the mud, and for a movie like Balls of Fury to depend on him carrying it, of course the whole house then falls flat. This movie is an example of him being unable to spear-head a movie, and that he is better built for supporting roles. Even the redeemable Walken, showcasing his self- parody style and perfect dialogue delivery, could not help lift or alleviate the walking corpse that this movie is. It has few redeemable features, its stupidly predictable, and has little to offer to the genre of comedy.",2,0,4,6 February 2017
Tangled," A tangled mess
","Tangled is amateur work when compared against it's goliath predecessors, considering its own goliath $240 million budget. This goes to show no amount of money can buy an animation truly emotive with worthwhile songs and character complexes. Tangled relies more on slap- stick comedy than on story development and intrigue. It uses a timeless formula and executes it predictably to sub-standards. Tangled is a colourful mess, riddled with on-the-nose scenes that have the depth of a placid pool. Animations such as these, although targeted primarily for children, usually showcase their strength by having something for everyone, but Tangled doesn't bother, and will be a forgotten farce of an animation.",3,0,8,6 February 2017
Lion," Beautiful and emotional
","Lion is an incredibly made film, using gorgeous set scenes and a powerful cast. Sunny Pawar is incredible at expressing emotions with nothing but his eyes and actions. Watching Pawar create young Saroo as vulnerable against the treacherous world, and flying to the whims of destiny creates a roller-coaster of emotions and intrigue. To then be transformed into a Saroo portrayed by Dev Patel is incredible and consistent with the film's aims. Patel does a wonderful job at Saroo's identity crisis, his want to know and find more, and his alienation from the current social scene. The flow of the film and where it ends really brings to light numerous questions revolved around identity, family, and ancestry. Garth Davis does very well in combining the cast with such a well developed story, and using scenery and music to really evoke the needed emotions to hit real life problems to an audience seeking genuine and raw goodness. Lion is a dime a dozen, and more so impressive to find out it's Australian roots and low budget.",9,0,0,9 February 2017
Ant-Man," Odd, but good
","Ant-man has a different tone and style to all the other Marvel films. It is surprisingly entertaining and has a marvelous balance between comedy, action, and drama. With an over-complicated plot that relies too much on coincidence, the believability is questionable at times. And like the other marvel superhero films, the villain has no character depth, and is very card-board. Rudd is the perfect choice for Ant-Man, and Douglas and Lilly were fine supporting roles. The movie had some cute and enjoyable tie-ins with the greater realm of Marvel, and has enough references and teases to be a true part of the Marvel universe without being overbearing or obvious to the point of cringe.",7,0,0,12 February 2017
Fargo," Banter to the point of greatness
","Fargo is a near perfect Coen Brothers film. It has witty banter, the perfect balance of character development and action, and a climax exceeding expectations. It is one of those few films that stand the test of time, and can entertain from beginning to end. It's dark, satirical, quirky, and fundamentally a unique flavour, catering to all aspects desired. Frances McDormand is incredible as the police office in charge of the investigation, and creates the perfect character to drive such a curious and intriguing story. She does very well in carrying such a well written film, with a fantastic ensemble cast. Fargo is an incredibly low-key great film, and is created to such perfection.",10,0,1,9 February 2017
Split," Anticlimactic, but a good resurgence for Shyamalan
","Split is an interesting and intriguing film, creating a lot of questions and building an incredibly suspenseful atmosphere. It is M.Night Shyamalan's best film for a long time, as he has constantly missed the nail on his last several ventures. Split showcases the quiet skills and talents he had in building atmosphere and story in The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable. However, whilst those two had great endings, Split's ending; the use of the beast and his 'powers' as well as the importance of Anya Taylor-Joy's character, is extremely unsatisfying and lacklustre.The use of Bruce Willis to tie this film to unbreakable feels attached last minute, and has little effect on the previous occurrences of the film, although promising more in future films. James McAvoy is the star of the show. His skill in bringing several different characters to life is incredible; through slight nuances and carefully deliberate actions. He overshadows the cast and steals every scene he is in, even when at his least formidable and least impressive, ironically, as the beast. McAvoy is unnerving, intriguing, and inspiring to watch, as he switches between and combines characters. It will be very interesting to see McAvoy face off against Willis in a sequel, which in itself, gives credit to the worthiness of Split, although it was not as good as promised, or as rumoured.",6,1,9,9 February 2017
Jackie," Over ambitious and over glamorised
","Jackie is a straightforward film on Jackie Kennedy's life shortly after the death of her husband, the president of the United States of America. Using snippets of real footage, it delves into her life prior, during, and post the death, and how she thinks, and what she does.Natalie Portman portrays Jackie Kennedy with incredible gusto, going to great lengths to evoke the trauma that Jackie would have suffered. It is sorrow and pain that Portman paints through her portrayal, and the resulting actions, whether for better or worse. Jackie is filmed in a very interesting manner; using a lot of close- ups, eerie music, dry and dreary-coloured scenes, and picturesque still moments. Pablo Larrain used music and silence to really drive the concept of death and its affects on all involved. Larrain has brought his own style to an American film that no other director could do without coming across too campy or patriotic. However, Larrain manages a tasteful style that brings elegance, poise, and deliberateness to the role of presidency, and to those who are intimately involved. However, with all that is said, the film has no clear message or point by the end, and feels needless and unnecessary. The concept of Jackie Kennedy is glamorised and put on a pedestal with no aim. Whilst interesting, by film's end, a feeling of disappointment and emptiness can't be helped. And no lingering affect of any shape is felt by the film, with no poignant message; contrary to the expectation.",6,0,1,9 February 2017
The Princess Bride," Heart-felt and full of splendour
","The Princess Bride is a perfect blend of humour across the ages, and a charm catering to all. Through the eyes of a child and his story teller, it touches on loss, tragedy, death, and revenge. The style of story-telling and the unique capture of banter makes the dark more light-hearted, and makes the light-hearted more heavy. It is an adventure filled witty dialogue and fantastic actors, who do a magnificent job bringing to life such a simple story. The Princess Bride is a result of great direction by Reiner, magnificent writing, and once more, incredible acting. Forget the title, the film is for anyone with a heart.",9,1,2,11 February 2017
Insidious," More comedic than horrific
","Insidious is a stereotype horror film, filled to the brim with cheap shock drops and a story lacking depth or interest. There are some impressive moments of lighting vs framing, but it doesn't flow, and becomes too fantastical and mystical to be grounded and real. The climax conflicts with the main body of the film, where it is attempting to ground the surreal and paranormal, but then sends the world of Insidious into a 'hell-ish' scene which is so flamboyant, it is more comedic than horrific. Insidious falls victim to showing too much of the shadowy villain, and leaves little to be desired. With so little left to the imagination, it becomes more boring than anything else.",4,0,0,13 February 2017
Hidden Figures," With poise comes power
","Hidden Figures is a fantastic film about segregation and the affects it has had on career paths. Whilst the main focus is the mathematics and the foundation of the space program, it intertwines this story with the struggles of 3 separate women of colour who have to prove their worth in different ways to a world set against them. Taraji Henson is easily the stand-out, carrying every emotional scene with her weight, and propelling the film to its great status. Octavia Spencer and Janelle Monae do wonderfully, but simply do not have as much gravitas as Henson. These three actresses have a great chemistry between them, portraying their characters with true poignancy. Theodore Melfi has made a surprisingly straightforward and simple story into an electrically charged film, fuelled with excitement and attitude. This is a great achievement for Melfi, who is new in the directing seat. The use of real footage and true stories intertwined into the fictitious story works well to establish a period film. The dignity and poise these powerful actress carry in their roles is admirable and fantastic to see. Hidden Figures has managed to bring light upon the unspoken heroes in a beautifully tasteful manner.",9,1,7,20 February 2017
Big Hero 6," Has its ups, and its downs.
","Big hero 6 is set in a combined setting to Tokyo meets San Francisco. The protagonist; Hiro, is built from a cliché foundation; a broken family and questions to his lineage. It ends on a similarly cliché tone; where the good prevail. The excitement is mild, the antagonist has a flawed motive, and the animation is not anything unseen before. Whilst there are pleasant motives, and it is by far not an abysmal debacle, it leaves much to be desired and has no memorable soundtrack or moments. Big Hero 6 misses the mark it's larger iconic predecessors have set. Maybe its directors; Don Hall and Chris Williams, should stick to their strengths; writing.",6,2,2,6 February 2017
Jurassic World," Not as magical, but a great addition to the franchise
","Jurrasic World is a perfect blend of new ideas and old ideas to the Jurrasic franchise. With some great moments made as an homage to the original, it has its light moments, its comedic moments, and its action, balanced well enough to carry an overused and predictable plot. Howard does a beautiful job as the powerful lead actress trying to control chaos and the consequent adaption required. And D'onofrio, as talented of an actor as he is, was a complete miss in character. His comically painted villainy is cheesy, clichÃ©, and crosses the border into hilarity. It becomes so bad, it feels ironic and intentional. Jurrasic World is an enjoyable feat that does far better than its predecessors but unfortunately, it is not as magical as the original.",7,0,0,12 February 2017
Silence," Over-zealous and under-achieving
","With a 3 hour film directed by Martin Scorsese, there was nothing but anticipation and excitement for his latest creation. Knowing it was a passion project, and that it's the first film Scorsese is credited for writing since Casino, expectations were high. However, as Silence screens, whilst the cinematography and the music really help bring a world to life, the story drags and never results with a pay-off or any truly in-depth substance. Silence is filled with 'on the nose' material, blunt to every point, and little subtlety. Garfield and Driver are average at best, but at no point, do their characters bring vibrancy or depth to the story. Funnily enough, or ironically maybe, the Japanese and their goals are more relatable than the 'heroes' of the story.",5,3,4,16 February 2017
Logan," One of the best X-men films to date
","Logan is a dark and gritty take on Hugh Jackman's Wolverine. It delves less into glamorizing heroes and super-powers, and instead grounds itself into the mortality of one's legacy. This is one of the first films that have added great depth and complexity to the character of Logan, leaving him in a moral mess. Dafne King is surprisingly powerful and convincing in her initial unspoken role. However, the more she speaks English later in the film, the aura of mystery surrounding her dissipates and leaves a generic young actress, with the initial power of silence gone.James Mangold did very well with Logan, and while the majority of the film has taken to a more Western tone, it ends on a note similar to other x-men films, and at the end of the day, has the all too familiar feel, providing a minimal lasting impact.",7,1,5,5 March 2017
Sinister," Surprising, but not fantastic
","Sinister is a surprisingly interesting and intriguing horror film. It maintains an element of mystery, it keeps the catalyst of horror on the outskirts, and uses lighting and music to glamorise and set the tone. Per usual to the genre, there are stupid mistakes made by the protagonist to drive the story and the horror element. Hawke does a well enough job, but the cheap shock drops, especially at the end, do nothing for him or the movie. Better than its counterparts in the genre, Sinister has just enough story to bring a little bit of scare to the table. Sinister raises enough questions, and is barely good enough to consider what a sequel might look like, if done properly, and hopefully, better.",5,0,2,13 February 2017
Arrival," Delightfully deep and powerful
","Arrival is another great film by Villeneuve, who seems unable to put a foot wrong so far. It has a suspenseful score akin to Sicario that creates a tense and highly strung tone. Amy Adams showcases some incredible acting that helps bring to light its interesting and questioning time-line. Playing with concepts of the effect of language on the mind, this film is emotionally charged, as well as influential on its take on language, time, and the inevitability of ones actions. Arrival is a fantastic film, enabling a shroud of intrigue and excitement with the perfect close. It is disappointing to see such a talented actress as Adams still not rewarded for her performances, that are unquestionably getting better as the years progress.",9,1,8,6 February 2017
The Shawshank Redemption," Lives to its name
","The Shawshank Redemption is a classically quiet film about the injustice served to one man and his consequent adaptive actions. Frank Darabont has shown true talent in the creation of this near-perfect modest film with most scenes showcasing deliberate quaint beauty. Emphasising the beauty of life through many mediums, some ethical, some not, this film really helps the viewer appreciate life and the little things. With a cast performing their roles perfectly, this uplifting and high-spirited film is a stand alone about every simple aspect of life and how it is approached. The Shawshank Redemption is a deserved classic.",9,0,0,6 February 2017
The Godfather," Setting the tone
","The Godfather set the tone for generations of film after it; through directing, acting, the power of music, and the power of culture. Francis Ford Coppola masterfully creates a small world within America, where the Italian culture permeates and adapts to the world around it. Brought to life by giants like Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall, and juxtapositioned against an alienated Al Pacino, who evolves his character to a point where he finally shoulders and carries the film. The music is so wonderful to the time the film is set in, and is a character in and of itself, marking distinct scenes into immortality. The Godfather is a film built out of perfection, and easily stands the test of time.",10,0,0,6 February 2017
