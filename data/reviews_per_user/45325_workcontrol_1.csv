Hereditary," Modern horror classic
","This film blew me away. The first hour is a family drama with a great soundtrack. Then the film turns into a horror with some creepy scenes. It's not your typical jump scare rubbish, this film stays with you after you watch it! Brilliant show from start to finish. Toni Collete is amazing!",10,3,8,25 June 2018
