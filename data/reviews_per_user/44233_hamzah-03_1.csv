Insidious: Chapter 2," Hilarious Comedy and Scary Horror!
","This movie was hilarious, the bearded dude was a boss. Anyways if you have the movie I would definitely watch this preferably at night. I mostly enjoyed the movie due to the comedy, (I don't know if thats a good thing or bad thing) but there were parts where I did jump. Lots of people didn't like the fact that it was funny, but I did. They mixed it up well with comedy and horror, and created a better sequel than the first. The story was amazing though, it summed up all the questions we had after the first of this series. All in all the movie isn't a must watch but if you have the money and you want to watch a movie, I would prefer this.",7,0,1,15 September 2013
