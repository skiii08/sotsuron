Sucker Punch," Glittery, but Lacking Substance
","Suckerpunch, kinda took us for a loop. We were very geared up to see it, short skirts, pigtails, explosions, what more could anyone need? Bright colors, a modern soundtrack...The story telling, wordless intro did impress my group greatly. It was theatrical and captivating. And...once those ten minutes where over...it all went down hill. Its a shame, because we all loved 300 so much! ...So She's unjustly institutionalized, OK, we get a quick 360 at her surroundings and reality,grungy but OK, then suddenly we're water-boarded by A Dream-with-in-a-Dream scenario. To escape the harsh reality, all her future relationships/bonds/misadventures/heroic deeds are all 'fabricated', but still implicated in reality.But yet, reality isn't ever even returned to until the final five minutes. How did half of that translate? Slutty inmate dancing? (Chicago anyone?) Anyways, one question must be asked: So To escape an Asylum, one dreams up a Whore house, then to pull from that one, one dreams up a school girl, Charlie's angel, team to solve all the problems. Only to face real world retaliation and brutal punishment. Fair? We would have traded one exaggerated, slow-motion, pantie shot for more Development in Baby Doll's Relationships/friendships/Asylum life. To keep a baby dragon alive, I'd rather care for the girls trying to escape through clever dialog, which wasn't even remotely delivered for Amber and Blondie. What are Their reasons, who ARE they, why they're there.Do they all have bastard step fathers? Are they all just Bat-Sh*t? Now we'll never know because the 'clever resolve' was two bullets to the brainz. Hot, yes. Anything to really dwell on later, not so much, and it's heartbreaking to say. I guess it's really just meant for the 13-20/M/lonely/Anime lovers, it has nothing else for the rest of us.",4,20,41,26 March 2011
