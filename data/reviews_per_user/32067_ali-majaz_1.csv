Iron Man 3," Stark is Iron man Afterall
","A lot of people have rated this title very low , I don't understand why ? first thing first , Tony stark is not Bruce Wayne so don't expect him to stay quiet all the time and deliver one epic dialogue in the end,he is a witty character ,Tony stark has got a sense of humor which kind of adds to his character a certain sex appeal,I enjoyed watching this movie,there was a sense of curiosity about the script,the problem is a lot of people were expecting something different after looking at the trailer , but we forgot thats how iron man has always been, funny with one liners .Its an action packed marvel movie with twists and turns which make it more exciting plus it is visually very stunning ,gives you all that feel of technology and makes you feel like using it all by yourself , so if you enjoy those kind of movies with heavy dose of action and thrill then go watch IRON MAN 3 or else go read your Shakespeare novel",8,1,4,13 May 2013
