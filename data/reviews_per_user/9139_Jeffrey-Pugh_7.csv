The Expendables 2," 10/10 for sheer awfulness
","So stunningly bad it's amazing that apparently an Expendables 3 is in the works...the most amusing aspect was identifying the washed-up action 'actors' in the movie. Too bad Jason Statham is tarred by association with it. Let's pick a few aspects at random: the terrible acting, the painful dialog, the complete lack of chemistry, the heavy guns that don't have a recoil, the (sometimes) unlimited ammunition, the regenerating bad guys (especially in the airport scene), the incompetent villains.On the (sort-of) positive side, the movie is an advertisement for how even 60+ year old men can maintain muscle mass (naturally, I'm sure) and for the efficacy of multiple face lifts.",3,2,4,28 November 2013
Iron Man 3," Best of the three!
","Loved it. Better than Ironman (and of course we don't need to talk about Ironman 2), and maybe even on a par with the Avengers. Loved the more assertive Pepper from the opening scene with her shielding Tony to the 'hot' conclusion at the end :) Loved the whole middle section with Tony and the boy - I probably embarrassed my wife by cracking up so loudly during that section.The depressed, anxiety-ridden Stark was well done, although it would have been more believable if Avengers had ended with him being a little more shell-shocked instead of heading out for shawarma.Saw it in 2D, and have heard that I didn't miss anything except perhaps for the jump scene in 3D.Excuse me if some of my sentences get mixed up and end with the wrong cranberry!",8,0,2,5 June 2013
Chicken Run," Predictable, but good fun for children and adults
","I was searching around for something to watch on a vacation afternoon with my pre-teen and this was one of the few movies that we thought wouldn't bore us both (the last time we watched Madagascar 3, which was a laugh riot).Disney animation this is not - it's 'Wallace and Grommit' style stop- motion throughout, which can lead to some hilarious effects with splattered eggs, turnips, and gravy. If you've ever watched any World War II POW movies, you'll appreciate all the references here: the POW huts, the British accents, the over-bearing ex-RAF rooster, the solitary confinement, and even the Great Escape references. All good fun for the adult watching.It's not a 'split your sides laughing' movie, but if you like Wallace and Grommit you'll enjoy this as change of pace from standard animation.",7,4,4,20 February 2013
K-19: The Widowmaker," Great plot, good acting, terrible accents
","Everything about this movie could have been great. The plot arc is well done, with the hints of Soviet incompetence and inefficiency hinted at the beginning and coming back to hurt them later.It's a gripping story with the outcome uncertain until the end. The interplay between the main characters is well done, with fine supporting performances. Even Harrison Ford's limited facial expressions (how many does he have? 3?) is not an impediment as the rigid captain.Unfortunately, Harrison Ford and Liam Neeson just do a terrible (and inconsistent) job of their Russian accents and once you notice it (30 seconds in) it's impossible to shake. With better actors and with better voices I would have given this a 9.",7,1,2,5 February 2013
The Untouchables," Beautifully filmed, strong performances by Sean Connery and Robert de Niro
","Kevin Costner gives a strong performance as Elliot Ness, and for once his American accent (which has ruined other performances by him) is not an impediment. However Sean Connery and Robert de Niro are the stars for me. Sean Connery is the veteran beat cop who finally sees an opportunity to fulfill his vow and Robert de Niro is the violent but suave king of the liquor trade, Al Capone.The movie is beautifully filmed. Although it has plenty of violence, I didn't find it gratuitous in the manner of an Oliver Stone movie. This was a violent era and the movie captures all of it.",7,0,0,6 May 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Slow beginning, Great ending, but not as good as The Dark Knight
","This movie has moments of brilliance and some stellar acting in the personas of Bane, Catwoman and Blake, but unfortunately not in Batman. Keeping the dramatic tension in a 2:45 movie is always difficult, but this one has some really flat spots. Everything between the takeover of the city and the final scenes is confusing, pointless, and a little boring. **Spoiler** Bane's televised announcement to the city when the prison is blown open and the prisoners released is just meaningless and doesn't link logically to his stated intent of 'giving everybody hope' and then later destroying it. Bane is proved to be a highly intelligent and capable leader and strategist, so I'd think he could have come up with something better.What saved this movie for me were the final 15 minutes and especially the thread left hanging implying Batman survived and the Batcave is rediscovered.",7,1,3,29 May 2013
Looper," Good despite the gratuitous violence and the weird twist
","The movie was a gripping beginning, with enemies from the future appearing mysteriously and being shot at close range by the young Joe. OK, s it doesn't make sense (as one reviewer comments, apparently time machines are cheaper/more convenient in the future than incinerators) but it makes for a hell of plot idea. Similarly the gruesome 'doctoring' done on an escaped looper to make him 'turn himself in' (sort of).The high point of the movie was the encounter between old Joe and young Joe in the diner. I'm not a huge fan of Bruce Willis because I don't think he can really deliver the one-liners well (e.g. in the Die Hard movies), but he doesn't overdo it here.Unfortunately the plot twist introduced at this point just sends the movie off in an entirely different direction. Not that it wasn't entertaining, but it was a little much for my brain to handle. But then Bruce warned us that thinking about time travel would fry our brains didn't he?",7,0,1,14 February 2013
