Who Framed Roger Rabbit," The best of its kind!
","Roger Rabbit is a marvel, especially considering when it was made. Since 1988, there have been other films combining animation and live action (think: Cool World, Space Jam, and similar crap) but none of them have matched the quality of Roger Rabbit despite the fact that it preceded them by years and was made without the benefit of computer graphics. I'm not just referring to its almost seamless blend of Toon Town and The Real World, either--though certainly, the artistry of Roger Rabbit still manages to outshine its various clones by far. The plot, characters, and screen writing are perfect, hilarious, and a lot of fun.Bob Hoskins is amazing--I love the husky voice and accent he's adopted--and Joanna Cassidy, who plays Dolores, is rarely praised as she should be, it seems. Charles Fleischer, as the voice of Roger Rabbit (and a few other characters!) is perfect, too. He's an incredibly talented voice actor and this fact is more than obvious here.I also want to mention how much I like the lovely, melancholy soundtrack of this film.I loved this movie when it came out--I was just out of kindergarten--and I love it now. One of the many things that are so wonderful about Who Framed Roger Rabbit is its accessibility. It's full of innuendo and adult humor, but the characters are so much fun that viewers of any age should enjoy watching.",10,3,3,29 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pretty so-so.
","I love pirates but I thought this was a pretty disappointing movie.  Sure, Depp was great--he usually is.  His lines were some of the best in the film. I did enjoy the boats and sets a lot. However, I did not like Orlando Bloom and found him dull and irritating. Keira Knightley was clearly just chosen as a pretty face, since she wasn't too exciting, either.  It's a shame to see someone as talented as Depp paired up with two such inadequate actors. The film itself was long and without real substance.  I did enjoy the 'cameos' from specific parts of the WDW ride, though. Oh well.  I'd watch it again, but probably with the sound off.",7,1,2,21 March 2004
X-Men," Eclipsed by the sequel.
","This is a pretty decent film, though I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it so much without having seen the second one first.  Director Bryan Singer tries too hard to explain the characters to what he must assume is a very confused audience--for example, after Mystique has already established that she's a shapeshifter (by doing exactly that), Magneto mocks Senator Kelly by smirking, 'I've had Mystique here to keep you company.  She takes so many shapes.'  This isn't really necessary--and I'm speaking as someone who knew next to nothing about the X-men.  The other issue I have with this film is that Sabretooth is boring and Wolverine is an irritating jerk.  Yes, I know, he's supposed to be--but couldn't he have been rude without being so annoying?  All in all, it's a halfway decent movie--not nearly as great as X2, which focuses on plot rather than backstory.",7,0,0,18 September 2003
Taxi Driver," Incredible.
","What a masterpiece...the film editing, the dialogue, the emotion conveyed throughout--stunning.  Schrader is remarkable in what I believe to be his scriptwriting debut, Scorsese is impressive as usual.  I myself felt empathic towards Travis Bickle; the majority of the public will at least find him fascinating.",10,0,0,31 July 2000
Fargo," You betcha.
","I really enjoyed this film despite the fact that it was, as my friend so aptly put it, 'disturbing'.  The characters were wonderful, the filming was often stunning, and the script managed to present the horror of humanity in a surprisingly irreverent light.",10,0,0,22 January 2001
Doctor Zhivago," Beautiful, beautiful.
","I have to admit that I'm a cynic with a very short attention span.  For these reasons I was unable to finish Zhivago upon first viewing it, a fact which puzzles me now that I've actually watched the entire film.  In short, it's incredible.  Jaw-dropping.  I encourage any incurable romantic/history buff/Russian-enthusiast to rent Zhivago regardless of the length of their attention span...and in doing so, enjoy it.",10,3,4,5 October 2000
American Beauty," A wonder.
","To make this brief, I have never seen such an incredibly beautiful film in the theater!  (Well, except when Gone With the Wind was rereleased in June of 1998, of course.)  It revived my hope in modern moviemaking, actually! Such an aesthetically pleasing film.",10,0,0,18 June 2000
X-Men: The Last Stand," Um, different.
","I really did enjoy this movie, but anybody who says that it's way different from the first two isn't kidding. First off, it's much, much darker--too dark for my taste. There aren't any genuine spoilers in my review here, but I do allude to a few things...so the warning's there.Many people seemed way too out of character--not just as compared to the comic books, but as compared to the first two films. Since when was Magneto such a total jerk? (Anyone who's seen the movie already knows exactly what I'm talking about. Poor Mystique.) Sure, he's the villain, but he's not supposed to be evil. He of all people would know that you shouldn't automatically hate someone for his/her religious beliefs or race or even whether or not he/she's a mutant. He took the mutant superiority thing way too far in this film in several ways, and became sort of blindly stupid about a lot of things. Oh, and Wolverine sobbing? Yeah right.The Phoenix was pretty well done, though the explanation of how she became who she was a little far-fetched. (And that brings us to another guy who's out-of-character--Professor Xavier wouldn't do that, would he?) X3 is definitely a thrilling movie with amazing fight scenes, but it had very little in the way of character and plot development. (And what it did do in that area fell in the realm of either the bizarre or the clich√©.) Usually I'm not one to say this sort of thing, but this movie should have been a lot longer. Either that or it should have been edited much differently. There are way too many unresolved issues and way too many questions.",7,0,1,26 May 2006
A Clockwork Orange," Viddy well, viddy well.
","To be honest, the book was better.  But all the same, this movie--a true visual treat--was pretty horrorshow.  Malcolm McDowell is fantastic as Alex, and his droogs are entertaining as well.  The real beauty of the film lies in its completely unpredictable scenery, mannerisms, language, and, of course, main character.  O my brothers!",8,0,0,2 August 2000
Blow," Pretty good.
","I really enjoyed this movie.  It's really pretty remarkable, in fact, the way that director Demme created a burned-out, middle-aged, and overweight suburbanite out of Johnny Depp.  There were certain parts in the movie that should have been more developed--for instance, I would have appreciated more background on George Jung's relationship with his parents.  There is also a scene near the end involving his daughter, and I'm not entirely sure why it was created. I don't want to 'blow' it for you, (heh heh heh), but I have a feeling that most viewers will be vaguely confused by this random scene. Regardless--a great effort on the part of the director and his crew, and definitely a movie worth seeing.  I love the 1970's nostalgia, too.",7,0,0,9 April 2001
X2: X-Men United," Better than the first.
","This movie was great--much better than the original film, which was pretty standard as far as summer blockbusters go.  X-2 skipped all the awkward and unnecessary attempts at a backstory (and I'm speaking as someone who knew next to nothing about the XMen when I saw the film) and went straight for an intelligent route.  The characters were fascinating and the special effects were truly pretty good--and that's saying something, since I'm usually bored out of my mind by that kind of thing.Some of the acting was absolutely wonderful.  Rebecca Romijn Stamos, Ian McKellen, Alan Cummings, Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Anna Paquin more than made up for the mediocre attempts of Halle Berry and Famke Janssen.",9,15,18,18 September 2003
Sin City," Stylistically amazing, but too gross.
","And confusing, but I suppose that's my fault because I'm not familiar with the books...er, graphic novels. Sin City would have been a lot better without the gore, but might just be worth seeing if you're a film buff interested in something a little different. (That's really who I'm directing this review at, by the way, not those of you who base your opinions of movies on how many people get blown up in them--because I'm just going to assume you'll like Sin City!) Great cinematography overall and it will almost definitely win some awards for editing, I think. The style of the thing is really neat and incredibly creative. Don't miss Elijah Wood, proving that adorable child actors can successfully become creepy-as-hell adult actors, and Devon Aoki as the coolest character in the whole movie.But to put it bluntly, I would have been disgusted and bored if not for the STYLE of the film. It doesn't have that much going for it otherwise.",7,1,2,14 April 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," The soundtrack is the best part.
","This movie is definitely fun and worth seeing--I for one would like to watch it again--and it's nice seeing George Clooney in a role more interesting than that which he plays (played?) on E.R. John Turturro, another talented actor, also does a great job.However, I bought the soundtrack of this movie first and as a result had certain expectations built up around it. The music is beautiful and actually plays a rather large part in the movie, so if you have no interest in bluegrass/folk or such similar stuff, you probably won't enjoy O Brother.I'm not sure, of course, but that's sort of the impression I've gotten.",9,0,1,29 September 2004
