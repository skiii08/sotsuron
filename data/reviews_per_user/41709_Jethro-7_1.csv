Antz," Take away the animation and the story is simple
","If this was a film starring human actors it would be a monumental flop. The storyline is flimsy, the plot non-existent and it is so hideously predictable. The only thing that was missing was some Communist sub-plot about how an individual is an essential part of the community but nothing without the community. Granted the animation was great but we're a generation of movie watchers who need to be intrigued, entertained and stimulated. If you look beyond the graphics, which after 5 minutes you become inured to, the movie is really, really simple",4,7,14,29 March 1999
