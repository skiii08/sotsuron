Resident Evil: Afterlife," It's not very original, but it's still so much fun
","Resident Evil: Afterlife is the 4th instalment of the Resident Evil series. Milla Jovovich goes back to do what she does best: kick ass.With a new villain, new location and a big man with a big axe, RE4 sees Alice trying to find Arcadia, the so called last safe haven for survivors of the T-virus. She finds her old ally Claire from the 3rd film, who has lost her memory, and together they meet up with a new group of survivors trying to get to Arcadia. Easier said than done when they're all surrounded by the undead.Jovovich and Ali Larter do well as the leading ladies of action, but Shawn Roberts is basically just channeling The Matrix's Agent Smith as the villain Wesker, from the voice right down to the sunglasses. He comes off looking like a video game character all right. Prison Break's Wentworth Miller does alright as Claire's brother Chris, but still sounds like Michael Scofield, as always.Roberts isn't the only thing here that reminds me of The Matrix, all the slow mo action sequences just screams of it too. But you know, it just works very well. To his credit, Paul W.S. Anderson doesn't pretend to make a cerebral action horror flick, he just gives what his audiences want: a bloody good time. You want blood, gore, monsters and Alice looking awesome? They're all here.The familiarity of it all might annoy you at first, but after a while you'll feel comfy and end up getting a real kick out of this.Bring on RE5!",8,18,38,10 September 2010
The Expendables," A slight disappointment, but still fun
","The Expendables is basically an action film junkie's dream drug. You get a whole team of action stars, from Stallone to Statham, from Jet Li to Lundgren, even Stone Cold Steve Austin and Eric Roberts show up as the bad guys. Cool? Well, kinda.Now, I like the whole idea of all these musclemen teaming together to make an action film that is totally balls out and nowhere near as complicated as Bourne or Salt, and in that aspect, it succeeds. But Stallone needs a better editor and cinematographer.Some scenes just drag on and on when they should have been shorter, and sadly some of the fight scenes were either not properly lit or was shot too close so you can't see who's kicking who or where. This spoilt the film for me.Other than that, Stallone delivers yet again. Too bad he couldn't get Van Damme, Seagal or Snipes to be here. But he does manage to get Willis and the Governator himself to make cameos! Now if that's not cool, I don't know what is.Go see this. But again I must say, it can be better.",7,0,3,10 September 2010
