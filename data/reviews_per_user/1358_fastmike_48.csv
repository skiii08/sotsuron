The Mask," It isn't easy being Green.
","The legend of 'The Mask', exits for fun on the screen, but was for real for Jim Carrey. 'The Mask' is all Jim Carrey, and in my opinion at least, shows Jim Carrey at his most talented best. Carrey has made many films since 'The Mask', but nothing 'unleashes' him as this film does. Cameron Diaz ('the girl'), Peter Green ('the bad guy'), Peter Reigert and Jim Doughan (Bumbling Detectives) all support Carrey in this highly imaginative, comical, special effects loaded (Oscar nominated) totally fun movie.See it for sure, and you'll see that Chuck Russell (Director) , Michael Fallon and Mark Verheiden (writers) have earned a place in cinema classic comedy with 'The Mask', a comedy for all ages.",Null,0,0,25 May 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," A fist full of yen.
","Talk about fusion! Take two cultures, half a world apart, and let Quentin and Uma fold them together!Quentin Tarantino, with this second installment and concluding volume of 'Kill Bill', proves that perhaps, his genius has no limit.Tarantino has mastered the art of taking humorous absurdities, situations, characters and creating a definitive plot, to which a conclusion is as certain as the next full moon. Although not a violent as the first, it's a masterpiece of the comic book like story, plus the low budget eastern action adventure film and that (almost) all takes place in the American southwest.It's as if he carried the Kurt Vonnegut style to a more subtle, and higher plane.No doubt his careful selection of Thurman, Carradine, Hannah, Jackson, et. al., (the Quentin crazy 88's) make this 'come alive, and breath'.But the real master here is Tarantino.If you like the bizarre, the cabaret of the unusual, and Tarantino then see both see the Bill's.",Null,0,1,16 August 2004
The New World," Gitchee, but not Gumee
","There is a lot of good and bad to be said about this 20th century reality view of 'the Indian Princess', Pocahontas. First off, it seems to be another in a long line of 'east meets west' culture clash movies. (In this case, the Europeans are the 'east') The cinematography itself is beautiful, and the style manor and detail of costume and set will give you a 'glimpse' of the people of the time of King James.There are some notable performances too, not award winning, but notable. 'Q' Kilcher is, indeed gorgeous, and gives a fine portrait of 'prancing' Pocahantas. It is to her misfortune, however, that director Malick might of been a little too focused on her, and the end result is that it looks like a three hour screen test of Kilcher.Colin Farrell proves he has talent indeed! Throughout the entire film, he wears an unflinching expression of a man who has forgotten something important, and just can't remember what it is.Wes Studi adds another native American performance to a long list in his Hollywood career. Mr. Studi should be given an award for his portrayal of Native Americans throughout the years, because no one person has done more than Mr. Studi to dispel the 'typical' Hollywood 'cowboy and Indian' portrayal of Native Americans. Even when he has played the 'heavy', the portrait is strong and dignified. Overall, it's pleasing entertainment, that could have been a 'lot shorter', and will entertain the history buff, but seems to be headed for the shelf in the wake of more exciting summer entertainment",6,0,2,5 June 2006
Catch Me If You Can," Wake me if you can.
","In spite of a star studded cast, and excellent, though muted, performances by Tom Hanks, Christopher Walken, Martin Sheen and Leonard DiCaprio the story never really picks up momentum and seemed to me as kind of dull.
On the bright side, however, the technical side of this 'film' (Dreamworks has got to be all digital, it's just too good) was as good as 'The Road to Perdition' and the soundtrack was also 'ear-catching'.All things considered, it was an OK movie, but certainly below what one would expect of Speilberg.",Null,0,1,24 June 2003
Minority Report," Precrime and Punishment?
","I often wondered what Alfred Hitchcock could have produced, had he the 21st century digital technology of today. Clearly, Steven Spielberg has filled and exceeded that gap, and is creating a new standard, by combining special effect, emotional tension, a surreal soundtrack, and an unbelievable sequence of digitally mastered scenes that will cause you to surrender all concept of reality, let the action take you on a whirl wind tour of your imagination and rivet your attention with a jigsaw puzzle story that will rock your psyche. The message here is obvious. 'Minority  Report'  brings into focus, (in a not too subtle way) questions of Constitutionality vs. Public welfare. Tom Cruise (John Anderton) and Collin Farrel (Danny Witwer) battle for the soul of Justice, in murder free Washington D.C. of 50 years hence.Be prepared, though. This intricate web of fear, escape, chase and solve, is a bit too long for an action drama.  You'll need an intermission, unless you have an attention span of two plus hours.'Minority Report' is science fiction Spielberg, at his best. By all means, see it. You just won't, ...well, ....er...well,.... you just won't believe your eyes.",Null,0,0,24 March 2003
Training Day," Another bad cop movie.
","Apparently, the viewing public and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, loves bad cop movies. Now, I know what your thinking. Was that five bad cop movies, or six? Well to tell you the truth, in all this excitement, I kinda lost track myself. You know, the nice thing about the internet is that the ordinary, run-of-the-mill-movie-viewer can express his/her thoughts about the entertainment they've paid for, and not have to think that what the critics think is what everyone thinks. So here's what I think:I can't believe the fuss made over this new bad cop movie.
Without a doubt, you will be captivated and even frightened by Denzel Washington's portrayal of Detective Alonzo Harris, an over-the-edge narcotics detective. And you will be equally riveted by Ethan Hawke's portrayal of rookie detective Jake Hoyt, who has the all time worst first day on the job. The movie mixes the fantastically corrupt cops with Godfather (Mafia type) violence with the backdrop one of this nations largest cities, 혩the Hood'. This is a case to way to much talent wasted on the tiring bad-cop-good-cop theme. Training day ranks up there with 혩The French Connection', 혩Dirty Harry' and 혩L.A. Confidential'. So, yea it's a thriller, and you can ride with it, but, at least in my opinion, it's far less than memorable.FM",Null,26,55,29 April 2002
Citizen Kane," War of the Medias.
","Orson Welles not so veiled caricature of William Randolf Hearst, which was so biting that it managed to get him blacklisted for a time.Welles quite often paraphrased Hearst in the film ('...tell him to supply the prose, and I'll supply the war...') , and mocked him by a satirized 'paralleled' story of his life.But without having to know the intricate and subtleties of the story, it is still one of the greatest works of cinema art to date.

Alexander," The 'bust' of Alexander
","Having read a great deal of literature over the years, I've developed a feeling that, because of their suffering throughout the ages, God mercifully bestowed the gift of great literature and theater upon the Irish.This will be obvious in Alexander, for although this takes place in ancient Greece, on would think that, by the overwhelming wonderful Irish accents, the cast had rehearsed for Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot'.Kilmer and Jolie were excellent as Philip and Olympias, respectively, although I don't know why they had the wonderfully beautiful Jolie speak with a Hollywood type of Russian accent,that was reminiscent of Natasha, of Rocky and Bullwinkle fame.As for Alexander, well, he sure did remind me of those ancient 'busts' but was far from inspirational. Actually he reminded me of Mel Gibson, who would have made a splendid Alexander.Mr Stone would have done better to have focused on a particular incident or two to capture Alexander. Perhaps the two brilliant victories engineered by 'ATG' against Darius, against a vastly superior Presian force.One last note. Angelina Jolie should make a pilgrimage to Greece to thank the all the ancient gods that Olympias never met her daughter-in-law, Roxan, face to face. Rosario Dawson certainly would have 'drawn attention' from Jolie's center stage performance, if that had to be written into the script.All-in-all, I preferred the history channel documentary to this choppy epic.",4,0,0,9 August 2005
Troy," My Big Fat Greek Tragedy
","I didn't expect it, but this was surprisingly good.Although some viewers might expect this to be an epic of Brad Pitt running around in a cocktail dress, it isn't by far.In fact Peter O'Toole(Priam), Brian Cox (Agamemnon) , Brendan Gleeson (Menelaus), Eric Bana (Hector), along with Brad Pitt (Achilles) are all excellent, right down to the bitter end.The story is the story of Troy, although somewhat condensed and does 'outline', Homer's epic work.The special effects are excellent. The presentation just borders the classical stage, and the portrayals of these tragic heroes brought to life will appeal to your conception of the ancient Greeks of legend.Some sound effects are a bit over done, like sword 'clanking' and infantry charges, that sound more like cattle drives, and there is a heavy base overtone, that detracts from beautiful, and well placed vocals.So forget those expensive translations, toss out those 'Cliff Notes' and get Troy, a reborn classic.",6,5,10,2 January 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Another Disaster!
","Let me tell you right away, that, if you haven't seen to many of these 'end-of-the-world' movies, then I'll tell you that the story , the special effects, music, it's pace action, etc, etc, etc, are all good.But I've got to say, that I'm bored with the world being destroyed. I've seen it destroyed by giant moths (with a set of miniature twins, no less), fifty foot men, fifty foot women, nuclear bombs, radiation, stray planets, asteroids, nuclear bombs again, Martians, too much water, a flaming dragon, , pea pods, earthquake, volcano, 'a crack in the world' (You should have seen what caused that), apes, birds, more pea pods, zombies, a space virus, and on and on and on.In any event, the overall performances of everyone cast, is 'on par' with any other mass destruction movie ever made.I can't imagine what'll end the world next? (Perhaps Mel Gibson will make a sequel).",Null,0,1,18 October 2004
Hotel Rwanda," Rusesabagina's List
","I do not intend to sound sarcastic by my above 'one-line-summary'; for if the real life Paul Rusesabagina, a 'Hutu', did the things he was portrayed to do, to save hundreds of 'Tutsi', then indeed there is a comparison with great people of conscience like Oscar Schindler.The story is that of the infamous 'ethnic cleansing' of minority Tutsi's by their nationalist rivals, the Hutu's. The film also cleverly weaves in the reasons for the deep ethnic hatred between these peoples, by ordinary conversations between locals and European visitors.The violence is not nearly as bad as one might expect. In fact, the actual news reel footage that the world 'witnessed' at the time of this genocide was far, far worse than the movie portrays.The film will rivet you to the screen, as you follow 'Paul' beg, borrow, steal and bribe to save the lives of the 'hotel guests' Well worth seeing, a little bit 'over' on the acting but smartly sensitive to the brutal violence that Hollywood so often turns out, (even in its' jests) just a wee bit to long but,still, a story that need to be told, and more importantly needs to be heard.",7,1,1,25 April 2005

A hilarious spoof of your most feared Hollywood gangster movies. This story is one week in the life of two really 'good fellows', who spiral down the road to gangster doom,  all for the want of a second hand trailer home.

Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Gimme Shelter.
","If you plan to see this zany Kubrick B&W masterpiece, you must first see the very good (and tense) cold war thriller 'Fail Safe'.Dr. Strangelove lampoons the cold war era and political and scientific figures of the time, using the 'Fail Safe' plot. The (eventually to be) all star cast includes (three) great performances by Peter Sellers, an LBJ caricature by Slim Pickins, a very young James Earl Jones, Sterling Hayden (Capt. McCluskey in the Godfather), and best of all, a very 'hyper' George C. Scott.It's fast moving, not too long, funny and although somewhat dated, well worth watching to give you a 'sense' of what was 'happening' at the very dawn of the age of Aquarius.It'll make a great rainy afternoon 'fill-in' or first feature on your favorite movie night.",Null,1,3,13 September 2003
Blade II," Vlad to the Bone.
","OK, it's Halloween, and I'm a 'sucker' for a good vampire movie, and this is a good one. Wesley Snipes out performs his first chillingly cool 'Blade' performance. The digitaly 'enhanced' martial-arts-rap choreography gives new meaning to that old Broadway saying, 'Break-a-leg' and there's so much gore, that after a while, you'll become so totally desensitized to it.( So much so, you can hereafter watch 'Iron Chef' without even batting an eyelash)On the down side, it's a wee bit to long, and you really can't try to see this as a work of art, (which it isn't), but rather a load of tricks with treats. You know, a funny thought crossed my mind. What do you think Bela Lugosi would say, if he could have lived to see some of these awesome, mind blowing modern Hollywood 'Vampire thrillers'?I think probably the same thing you'll say after seeing Blade II : 'Bloody good show!'",Null,0,1,14 October 2002

Had it a little more sense and foresight, Steven Spielberg's 'Empire of the Sun' should have swept the table clean of awards.It is one of few productions in the history of cinema that uses the backdrop of war to create a meaningful and impacting work of cinema art. And, at least in my opinion, far exceeds 'All Quiet on the Western Front' and 'Saving Private Ryan' , (but does fall short of the impact of Schindler's List)If you enjoy Cinema Arts, then 'Empire of the Sun' is part of the very basic core of great Cinema and a must see; a early Spielberg Masterpiece.",Null,0,2,10 November 2003

The Village," Unspeakable Horror!
","I think that there was an ulterior motive to this production : it was designed so that it could not be critiqued, with out 'spoiling' the film for the reader. But I will try.First the dialog : for those reasons, of which I cannot speak of, was awful. It was as if the cast (which included William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver, Joaquim Phoenix , Brendon Gleeson and Bryce Howard) had to be untrained to act. It reminded me of a high school Shakespeare production.Why? Why do they speak as though this takes place not here and now but in an unknown time and place not of the choosing of mortal men and of mortal women?Then there was costume and props. They didn't just span decades. They spanned centuries! For those unmentionable things, of which I can not speak, I couldn't figure why this had to be this way. It look as though the village was furnished by PBS's 'Antique Road Show'. Had the costumes and props been consistent, the entire story would have been much more believable. But I will speak no more of this for it is not to be spoken of.And then, everything creaks! Everything. Every step, every door, every box, everything! There are no sounds in the forrest except twigs snapping. No birds, no crickets, no other noises excpt for that swarm of invisible flys .... of which, my sense of sight does not perceive.Then there is the story itself. It seemed to purposely imitate the Stephan King style.Of course there is a 'moral to this story', and it's totally 'retro'. The film missed the point, and the audience by about twenty years.I would not doubt that the imaginative M. Night Shamalan will one day come up with a winner, but 'The Village' certainly is not it.",3,1,3,10 January 2005
Doctor Zhivago," The 'Art' of Revolution
","One must be somewhat familiar with Russian literature and Russian History to truly appreciate the magnificence of the film 'Doctor Zhivago'. Usually, Russian novels were monumental Victorian works as Tolstoy's 'War and Peace' or Dostoyevsky's 'The Brothers Karamazov'. These works were astoundingly detailed and developed every character's life and life's experience while the world changed behind them, and also, perhaps the convergence of one or more character's life and the situation that faith leads him or her too. (Like having Napoleon admire the body of cavalry officer Wustov in 'War and Peace'). Bringing Russian literature to the silver screen in detail is a near impossibility. They're just to large and intricately woven.'Doctor Zhivago', however does bring a taste of both Czarist and Leninist Russia, and most importantly, Russian literature to us. Omar Sharif, Julie Christie, Rod Steiger and Alec Guinness supported by the performances of Geraldine Chaplin and Tom Courtenay beautifully and masterfully detail the life the times of the story, the portrait of the Russian writer, Boros Pasternak, and the people of whom he writes. All of the life's dramas played out here are captured in the double framework of history and the icy cinematography of Nicolas Roeg and Fred Young. Although quite a long film, by today's standards, the production and editing unveil a unique work of cinematic ice sculpture. The movie itself follows the original work rather well, and the changes made seem to be for the sake of cinematography and not to hide omissions related to the novel. (For example, having Lara and Yevgraf meet at the beautifully flowered cemetery in the spring, instead of the dreary colorless wake, as described in the novel.Doctor Zhivago is a 'must see' for anyone who appreciates those rare blended masterpieces of cinema and for anyone who has yet to glimpse the icy determination of the Russian soul and the Russian writer.",Null,2,3,17 February 2002
The Alamo," We really need to forget this, people.
","There is a scene in which Santa Anna tells his staff that if the Alamo isn't crushed, that their grandchildren and their great grandchildren will have to live off the crumbs of the north Americans.How prophetic!Dennis Quaid, Billy Bob Thornton, Emilio Echevarria, and the entire cast combine to give remarkably great performances to this very unfortunate period between the United States, and its close neighbor, Mexico. We do share a lot between us, now, however.The movie, story, its pace and battle action are good. The back round music, is a bit over done. But the timing and subject matter are terrible! With all due respect, all that was Mexico at one time, all the way up to California. I'd like to know what our southern neighbors, or even some of our newest citizens, think of this heroic adventure! The early US was a very aggressive confederation with designs on both Canada and the west, north of the Rio Grande. The British kept us in check, up north. President Thomas Jefferson offered Mexico millions for the south and west lands with one hand, and perhaps tried to provoke a war, covertly, under some back room dealings designed by Aaron Burr, with the other. (Which led to Burr's treason trial). (There was a little mention of one of the many land schemes, in the opening sequence.)Well, enough said.

Ardian Brody earned that Oscar, for his transformation from sensitive, intelligent musician, to a hunted, pitiful refugee, just surviving and staying one step ahead of the evil that intends to destroy him.Roman Polanski's masterful direction, blended with Pawel Edelman's extraordinary cinematography have created a visual symphony and brings to the light, belatedly, another story of the struggle for justice, in Europe, during the Holocaust.",Null,1,3,26 May 2003

Lucy Liu, number one on Mamba's 'hit parade', plays a perfect Tarantino 'heavy'.In fact, the construct, the structure, the Vonnegut like out of sequence event line that will tease the curiosity out of you, is his best yet.All in all, this is the best Tarantino to date and I've just got to see 'vol 2'.",Null,0,1,3 May 2004
2001: A Space Odyssey," Chariots of the gods?
","Without a doubt, this is a cinema 'milestone'. It is itself a star pointing obelisk, which separates the cold war era of evil alien or monsters invading earth, via Buck Roger's type space craft, to the vivid multi-dimensional modern space science fictions today. 2001, is, at least in my humble opinion, the calling card of Kubrick's technique.  It is not the story, but the Kubrick technique, that is perfected here. Extreme vistas, enhanced with color filters, the use of solid colors, bleakness, sharp light, sharp shadow, special effects, creating a sense of movement in stillness, by moving the camera, and not the subject, and so, much more. '2001' is an expression of cinema art, as much as, or more than entertainment.2001 is the mold for science fiction special effects, and themes  that are reflected, years later in such science  fiction, action drama such as 'Star Wars', 'Alien' or 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind', and more subtly in many, other more 'down to earth' cinema classics.Stanley Kubrick is to the visual, as Alfred Hitchcock is to tension.However, be aware of one thing, at least in my opinion. Kubrick sold himself short. '2001' was released in 1968, and at that time, such an abstract work was a big risk.  This was the time of the 'Age of Aquarius'. The fad at the time was mysticism. People were seeking answers through the peace and love movement, meditation, eastern religions and mind expansion. Kubrick shortcut the ending of this Arthur C Clark tale so much, that it, itself became one of the world's great mysteries. The psychedelic 'trip' through the atmosphere of Jupiter may have ensured that movie goers of the time would be sure to relive the experience over and over, (hence good box office revenues) and dwell and interpret something that Clark expressed so clearly and so soberly in his novel. If you've not seen '2001', then by all means do, more than once and pay special attention to those audio-visual techniques which will rivet you to your screen.But, certainly, and by all means, find a copy of Arthur C Clarks '2001' and read it, and you will 'clearly'  see for yourself that his vision of the future was real, tangible and hopeful.",Null,0,2,11 March 2003
The Last Samurai," Shogun, Vol.2
","Perhaps it's irony, perhaps it's marketing, but as James Clavell's 'Shogun' dramatized the beginning of the great Shogun dynasties, 'The last Samurai' dramatizes its downfall.In fact it's over dramatized. Way over.Ken Watanabe does manage to lift this mediocre action adventure with a performance that, for the most part, brings to life the ultimately beautiful, and extraordinarily refined culture of ancient Japan.The motives, the rush to westernize and the planting of the seeds of the militaristic period, are probably close to the actual historical events. (Well close enough for Hollywood work, anyway.)Tom Cruise does well, too, as an tormented American mercenary, under contract to modernize the Japanese army. (Which, in fact, the Japanese managed to do rather well, as we all know.) The entire plot, though, is a just a shadow of the ol' 'cultural transition plot'; you know, the kind of story where someone from (usually) western culture is suddenly thrust into, absorbs and becomes adopted by the foreign culture. 'Lawrence of Arabia' or 'Dances with Wolves' are two good examples.There are a couple of really good battle scenes, and if you think that music and battle don't mix, well, just turn off the sound.All in all, it's okay. But nothing more than okay.",Null,0,1,10 May 2004
National Treasure," The Maltese Eagle
","All this 'Templar Knights' stuff is becoming a little 'long-in-the-tooth'. No disrespect to the historical truth of the Knights of the Templar, nor Masons, nor anyone, but good heavens, enough already! I think that the only movie formula left undone, would be a Mel Brooks comedy on this subject.On the good side, I'll tell you that the cast is great with fun performances by Cage, Kruger, Bartha and Bean, and then 'stacked' with nice work by Christopher Plummer, John Voight and Harvey Keitel, to boot.All in all, it's a fun movie; a big long solve run chase twist and solve, some tense moments, with hardly any violence, nor ear curling language, nor eye popping 'romance', hence, a good family movie that everyone can enjoy.If I had to say anything negative, well, if you want more violence, language and 'romance', this can get a little long and boring and tedious with a seemingly endless 'sequence' of clues.But one way or the other, it's still worth seeing.I guess that all these Templar Knight mysteries are, well, 'the, uh, stuff that dreams are made of'.",5,1,1,15 May 2005

(However, I tend to think that someone mixed up the Oscar's between these two, no matter).The rest of this all star cast, freed up under the direction of Quentin Tarantino, shine like the Milky Way, on a clear night along the equator. Amanda Plumber, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Uma Thurman, Rosanna Arquette, Christopher Walken, Harvey Keitel and the supporting cast bring a cheap paper back novel to life on the silver screen.The segments with Trovolta and Thurman in the 1950's motif restaurant, and Jackson, Travolta, Plummer and Roth in the coffee shop are 'just' unforgettable.If you love cinema, this is a must see. Be forewarned, however, that the film is graphic and Tarantino uses a device sometimes seen in literature and less often in cinema, namely, and non linear and disjointed timeline (his trademark). Just go with the flow and enjoy one of the best cheap novels that you've never read.",Null,1,2,22 June 2003
The Untouchables," Bottoms up!
","Surprisingly, the top billed Kevin Costner seems a little tense and upstaged by Robert De Niro and Sean Connery, and the great supporting performances of Andy Garcia and Charles M Smith and Billy Drago.The plot moves at a good clip, there's lots of excitement and a climatic cop-gangster shoot-out that's probably one of the best ever! Mostly fiction, little fact, the story of the 'untouchable' Treasury agent Elliot Ness that took the badest of the bad bootleggers, the infamous unconvictable Alfonse Capone (who else could do this but Di Niro?) Brian De Palma, teamed up with the colorfully rich cinematography of Stephan Burum create a comic book like action adventure that's sure to be entertaining and a good choice if there's nothing to catch your fancy in the new release shelf.",6,13,29,15 March 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," As Advertised!
","Personally, there are very few II's that match up as good as the original. Once the 'cat's out of the bag', that initial 'uniqueness rush' is gone.However, if you enjoyed the original, then by all means watch this. Never mind the plot; it borders on Deja vu, but the very, very imaginative fight choreography, special effects and sound track are even better than the first!It really is a heck of a lot of fun to watch; great entertainment!",Null,0,0,22 October 2003
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Spellbound
","Look, this is J.K. Rowling brought to the screen and into your hearts with great directing, brilliant young actors and loads of special effects.It's tons of fun for a movie, go see it.Just one caveat, and that is that it's a sequel to something that was incredibly unique and a surprise to movie goers everywhere.If you're the type of viewer that's a little more critical, then you won't be as impressed as you were of the first Harry Potter story. You've seen a lot of the props, and spells, and characters, etc, etc.Now, I'm not saying at all that you'll be so bored, that you'll have to 'slug' it out 'till the end. So see it anyway, and let J.K. Rowlings magic cast  a spell on you!",Null,0,1,22 April 2003
Blade Runner," Great, Scott!
","Harrison Ford's best Hollywood moments are those in which he is being chased, or those in which he chases.Rutger Haner, as the leader of a group of really 'illegal aliens', replicants banned from ever returning to earth, gives Deckard (Ford) both the chase and run in this Ridley Scott science fiction masterpiece.Rutger Haner plays the part of a next generation artifically engineered human, who needs to find his creater, before his shortened, engineered life ends. Ford is the 'Blade-Runner', a member of a special police unit, that tracks down and 'retires' replicants. But a series of dream-like coincidences will leave you wondering about Deckard's own true nature.Blade Runner is another notch in the belt of Ridley Scott, brilliant director of Science Fiction masterpieces. If you like science fiction, this is a must see!",Null,0,1,5 July 2003
Ben-Hur," An Epic
","It is unfortunate that many viewers don't know the history of producing 'Ben Hur'.Heston, is without a doubt the focal point of the story of the family of Hur, under the rule of Rome. Heston is at the pinnacle of his career here and Heston becomes the heart and soul of the Hollywood Roman Spectacles here.The story was written by a civil war hero, Lew Wallace. The basis of the story of the family of Hur, is of power, injustice, revenge and forgiveness; it mirrors the same 'four horseman' of the American Civil War.The Karl Tunberg's screen adaptation of classic, follows Wallace's novel rather well (In case you haven't read it) and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's spectacular investment in extras and scenery create an epic Hollywood masterpiece.Ben Hur is Cinema 101. If you've been stranded on a desert island, and need to catch up on life, then Ben Hur should be among the first ten films you watch.",Null,3,4,18 May 2003
Signs," Corn Fiction
","The Good news: Mel Gibsons shines like the true star he is. Mel Gibson can take any script, at all, even this one, and put that Gibson spin: the facial semi-comical expressions and the tension he can create changing from humorous to serious, or that thing he does so well: trying to be serious and being clumsy. Gibson gives a terrific professional performance, and he's fun to watch.Joaquin Phoenix undid his 'heavy' performance as the evil Roman Emperor Commodus in Gladiator. He is convincingly a humble, do good, down home farm helper and younger brother to Gibson's character. What I liked the most is that he doesn't try to out-play Gibson.Rory Culkin and Abigail Breslin deserve honorable mention as Gibson's children and also fitting into their parts with Gibson and Phoenix.The bad news: This is a hodge-podge meal of every invasion-of-earth-science-fiction with heavy late fifties, early sixties entree of cold war get-down-in-the-basement-here-comes-the-invasion stew, with a Steven King 'sauce' and a subplot side dish. And it's way overcooked.The non-originality is so obvious at times, that you'll think that this 'thing' is a farce.It's okay for family entertainment, but I must say that it's light years from being an out-of-this-world science fiction.",Null,1,1,4 February 2003
Identity," Summer Reruns
","This is a case of 'good news/ bad news'.Well, the good news here is that this is indeed a frightening psycho-killer thriller. It is most certainly entertaining and has a lot of twists and turns, nicely timed that will keep your attention. The performances by John Cusack, Ray Liotta and Amanda Peet were also very, very good, and added a real touch of class to this thriller.The bad news, well, it's lacks not only originality, but tact. The setting is straight out of Alfred Hitchcock. The plot seems to be a combination of 'Friday the 13th XX', (especially the gore and screaming women) and an Agatha Cristie mystery and the producers make no secret about it! It seemed too obvious to be for real, but judge for yourself.My suggestion is that if you're at your video store and don't see anything really great, then you can settle on this.",Null,0,0,29 December 2003
The Producers," The leader!
","Dear Reader :It is rare to find genius whose focus and main intent, is to elicit laughter from an audience. The Producers is a timeless comedy, as much as those comedies written by 'the Bard', William Shakespeare.No kidding. Don't believe it? See it for yourself!Mel Brooks will eventually top this, but it's a first and sets a new standard.  It is cinamatic perfection; as much as 'Mutinity on the Bounty', 'Gone With The Wind', 'Doctor Zhivago' or 'Lawrence of Arabia'; but it's funny.This is one of those classics, a must see. If you've been stranded on a desert island for 50 years, and need to catch up, the 'The Producers' is the first comedy you should watch.And then watch it again and again and again and again.",Null,0,1,1 June 2003
Munich," No Quiet on the Eastern Front.
","Powerful. Tense. Riveting. Everything. A Spielberg masterpiece that should be described in the 'superlative degrees of comparisons only'. Once again, Steven Spielberg reflects, or perhaps supersedes the methods of the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. There's no need to describe the plot. There is no need to explain or criticize. It's the 'way', the technique, the presentation, the integration of location +character+music+plot+effects that ascends to a heretofore unattained level of action and suspense. If you are able to look past the political issue, you will see a modern cinema masterpiece. Spielberg has come light years from 'Star Wars', 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' or 'Jurassic Park'. Creations such as 'Schindler's List' and 'Saving Private Ryan' and now 'Munich' make his science fiction entertainment seem like merely toys for children.The film makes a political statement. It's bound to be controversial. The shady world of cross and double cross espionage, and an expose of, perhaps, a terrifying underground war, fought without concern for borders or boundaries. The presentation is far from one sided. In fact, there is a scene that parallels that of the captured German soldier in 'Pvt. Ryan', you get to see and hear 'the enemy'. It is not a 'war movie' as you might be used to, but it is a 'war movie' and the assassins eventually begin question their common confusion about the 'ethics' of their mission in this war.This is cinema 101. A must see masterpiece.As for the story, and the emotions that you're sure to experience, see it for yourself.",9,1,1,21 May 2006
The Matrix," If 'Cogito' then 'ergo sum'
","Since 'The Matrix Reloaded' was getting 'great press', I decided that it was about time, (and a good idea in case I stumble into a 'Matrix' conversation) to see the original.Too 'sum' it up : absolutely great (digital) science fiction. Laurence Fishburne, Keann Reeves and Carrie-Ann Moss, are a 'kernel of human rebels, out to battle an evil earth enslaving A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) , enforced by cohorts of A.I. agents, lead by Hugo Weaving as agent Smith (N.B. they're all called Smith).There is nothing artificial about the intelligence Andy and Larry Wachowski 'employed' in this creation. This is a must see, first class special effects wonder, and well worth enjoying and certainly will entertain your own 'Cogito'.",Null,0,1,1 June 2003
Apollo 13," Where Eagles Dare.
","It kind of shocks me to think that this event is as old to young people today as the second world war was to me in 1970.Fortunately, my memory serves me well enough, still, to recall the events of the Apollo 13 mission, and the phrase that captured the entire event : 'Houston, we have a problem'. The extraordinary visual effects combined with the all-star-packed casting couldn't have been better; each performance, from Tom Hanks down through the ranks to the techs at Mission Control, and the 'spot-narration' voice over (in the form of news bulletins) by Walter Cronkite accurately captured the anxiety, character, enthusiasm and  'can-do' attitude of this 'gremlin plagued' mission.If you lived these events then see it, it's sure to recall the times and places.  But if this is history to you see it and know that 'that's the way it was', at the very pinnacle, of the age of exploration.",Null,0,0,26 May 2003
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," 'Tell me what you eat, and I'll tell you what you are'.
","One way or the other, you will be captivated by this very, very 'Freudian' satire on 'non-conventional' relationships, morality, lost love, family and religion.For Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Antonio Banderas and Kirsten Dunst, 'the world is a tomb'. Elite vampires all, they can't seem to 'live' with each other, nor can they live without, and to put the 'nail in the coffin' death is just not an option.Be warned, there's a lot of explicit, intense vampire 'meals' that are just 'loaded' with innuendo.Neil Jordan and Ann Rice have 'teamed-up' very well to create a very unique, sophisticated, 'timeless' and certainly a 'biting' satire on modern day relationships.",Null,1,2,4 August 2003
Gangs of New York," Five points, one star.
","How is it that, by Hollywood history, Italians come over in 'family' size gangs, and become multimillion dollar celebrities, but the Irish come over by the tens of thousands, form gangs, and live in squalid poverty?This production is insulting to those Irish, who came here to escape one of the worst famines in world history, and literally built a nation. I refer the reader to Ken Burns PBS mini series 'New York', for details.I know this is suppose to be entertainment, but if that's the case, it's 'poor' entertainment, at best.If anything good is to be said for this 'entertainment' it's the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher, and an excellent portrayal of William Marcy Tweed by Jim Broadbent. It is obvious that Broadbent did his homework, and captured the character of that infamous New York 'boss', very well.If you feel compelled to see this, I'd suggest waiting until it comes down from the new release shelve.",Null,0,2,3 July 2003
Windtalkers," More Thin Red Lines.
","This is another 'war is really all hell' films, of the type pioneered by Speilberg's 'Pvt. Ryan', filled with plenty of gore and heroics and, although very entertaining, not unique.The Navajo code-talkers in this story, seem to be prop for the 'war-is-hell' theme, and does not really hit the point of the heroic efforts of the Navajo Americans, whose ancestors battled with the armies and politics of 19th century America and who managed to keep their own heritage, and at the same time become a inseparable part of the American mosaic.Adam Beach, Roger Willie, Nicolas Cage and Christian Slater do their duty as top-notch performers, but are far short of exceptional.If anything good is to be said for this run of the mill war movie it is for the special effects, (bloody) and an accurate depiction of how brutal war in the Pacific Theater had been.",Null,0,1,22 October 2002
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," O Brother, where were thou?
","After two years of World War II movies and Roman spectacles, I found myself at the local video store's new release' section recalling Yogi Berra's quip :'It's déjà vu, all over again'.Fortunately, Joel and Ethan Coen, weren't  suffering (entirely) from déjà vu when the musical epic `Oh Brother, where art thou?' sprang from their heads.At first glance, I thought I was watching an intellectualized `Three Stoogers' slapstick. At least until the three heroes meet John Goodman, and in an instant, I found myself wishing I was paying more attention to this so-far-out parody of Homer's eternally classic epic, the Odyssey. And long before the end of this classic-to-be had ended, I was already planning to watch it again and scrambling and digging for my English translation of ancient Greek literature.The cast and performances and humor have depth, and the music will hook your ears as if it came from sirens of bluegrass.By folding in eternally beautiful bluegrass, slightly tempering the entire mix with the premise of the epic ancient Greek poem, whipping the entire mix with the absolutely great performances by George Clooney, John Turturro and Tim Nelson, the Coen brothers have served up an epic of cinematic Homeric proportions, that actually may be enjoyed more than once.If you are becoming tired of seeing one time wonders, see this for the first, second or third time, or just get it again for the music.",Null,2,2,23 February 2002
The Godfather," A 'Prince' of a Movie
","Marlon Brando delivers one of his best, if not 'the' best, performances of his award winning career, as the 'feared and loved' Godfather.
Al Pacino, as son Michael Corleone, will also captivate you with, again, a career pinnacle performance. (He'll match it though, in part II).The list goes on with just awesome performances in this timeless classic: James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, and on and on and on.Francis Ford Coppola adapts Mario Puzo's novel, almost verbatim. (In fact, when part one and two are combined it is the novel in its' entirety)In this pre-digital creation, one must also pay close attention to the technical aspects, like the flawless props, the automobiles, costumes and backgrounds which mimic the 1940's through the 1950's. The cinematography is art and the music is haunting and beautiful.This film is classic cinema, a timeless work of art. Put in on your must see list, or see it again just for the details.",Null,1,4,8 June 2003
