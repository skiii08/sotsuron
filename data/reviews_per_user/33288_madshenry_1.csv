10 Cloverfield Lane," Possibly the worst adult movie i ever seen
","OK so here i am, sitting in my basement feeling totally ripped off. Before watching this movie i read some reviews, and thought that this would be a nice film to watch. My expectations were big to say the least. The first character we were introduced to was Michelle. She looked pretty good, and had a well rounded back hole. At this point i was still thinking this could be a OK rubbing off session. But when i saw who owned the hideout, i just felt my palm shrink AF. How could they possible defend using that 150kg walrus in a adult Flick!? Here i was all alone this evening, all by my self, hoping to fill the screen with my huge load of man juice, but The girl could even be Megan Fox, and it would still be impossible to ejaculate. If anybody are reading this review, please don't waste your time on this rubbish. I would rather rub my palm of to watching paint dry instead of watching this nonsense once again.",1,1,6,30 December 2016
