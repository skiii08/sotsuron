Mission: Impossible III," Summer Blockbuster Mission Impossible 3
","This movie is exciting, shocking, suspenseful, emotionally satisfying and has a fun retro soundtrack. I caution viewers that it is very violent, like War of the Worlds, and has astonishing special effects. Not for small children or the faint of heart, it is still a fine film for Mission Impossible fans, and even people too young to have seen the TV series, Mission Impossible. Usually franchise films run out of steam after the first few films, (who remembers 'The Howling 4, or 'Jaws 3'?) but this is a pretty strong film. Some people were claiming that Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who played the villain, stole the show, but I don't agree. I did find him marvelously repellent as the sadistic Owen Davian, though. So go see it! You might enjoy it!",10,0,1,10 May 2006
