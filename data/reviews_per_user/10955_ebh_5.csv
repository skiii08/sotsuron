Requiem for a Dream," One of the years best films
","This film absolutely blew me away. Don't get me wrong, I was no fan of 'PI', but this flick is a whole other story. This director may be a wunderkind, or he may flop after this. Who knows. Ellen Burstyn plays the pill-addicted Mother perfectly, and Jared Leto steps out from his normal prettyboy roles. The jaw-dropping digital effects are the real reason behind the success of this film however. This is an important, disturbing film, that should not be missed. Ellen Burstyn deserves the Oscar now!!",Null,0,0,6 November 2000
American Psycho," Not bad. Not bad at all
","I had expected this long awaited adaptation to be a lot worse than it really was. Although it is obviously not for all tastes, I think it succeeds on many levels. First off, Christian Bale's performance as yuppie killer Patrick Bateman deserves high praise. Secondly, the detail and photography is very good. The story lags in some parts, and obviously some of the more graphic scenes had to be deleted. But as a whole, I think the director was very faithful to Bret Easton Ellis' novel. I only wish he had written the screenplay as well. Than perhaps it would have been better. Overall, not half bad.",Null,0,0,15 April 2000
Any Given Sunday," Defintely NOT the best football movie ever!
","Whoever thinks it is the best football movie ever, needs their head examined. Stone is at his self-indulgent best here, however, but the 3 hour long movie never pays off. All build-up, with no finale. Pacino is very good, as is Jim Brown & Lawrence Taylor, but it's a poorly written film, with showy camera work (what else is new), and plenty of cliche' dialogue. Trim it by a half hour, and take out some of the excess garbage, and this film coulda been something to talk about. Instead, it's good for a 3 hour cat nap.",Null,1,1,27 December 1999
Sweet and Lowdown," Cute yet slight little film
","Sean Penn is excellent in this slight little comedy, about a womanizing jazz musician circa 1930's. Samantha Morton is equally as good as his mute girlfriend, Hattie. Very good jazz score, yet the film is so short and sweet, it flies by before you even knew what happened.",Null,0,0,1 February 2000
Sin City," c-r-a-p
","This movie is total crap. Sure -visually, it's stunning. But any movie can be stunning with a ton of money, and people who know how to do their job. Other than that, this is an over-the-top, too slick for its own good, wannabe film noir, but it misses the mark by a mile. Some of it was passable, for example the Mickey Rourke sequence I thought was well done, well acted, and the dialog was clever. But I felt that the acting by most of the woman character's was weak, almost sounded like line readings. Perhaps these women ( Gugino, Murphy,Alba, Dawson) are just nice to look at, and not much else. I have never fancied Rodriquez, he's a bit of a schmuck. His films are terrible, his writing is terrible, and he's an obnoxious creep, much like his pal Tarantino. I got an idea for a film, Tarantino & Rodriquez should hold a big love fest, where they do nothing but compliment each other, then at the very end, they blow each others brains out. I think that would be a great movie, and it would get rid of some waste in the business. Now if they'd only toss in Affleck, Damon, Edward Burns and Kevin Smith, I'd pay to see the sequel. If you have any taste in cinema, avoid this lame duck at all costs.",1,12,27,7 April 2005
