Come and See," Takes the war film to a whole new level
","Now when I say I never want to watch this movie again, I mean it with the best intentions. This one is tough, and if it wasn't so damn good I probably would stay away from it. While I'm sure other movies out there top Come and See as far as violence and artificial shock values go, Come and See is the real deal. War films tend to go toward either extreme subjectivity or for complete objectivity, which both have their uses, but Come and See blends the two together into something uniquely cinematic. War films come and go, with few of them leaving a mark on the audiences psyche. Come and See is a rough and wild ride that more than leaves a mark.",10,1,1,13 December 2010
