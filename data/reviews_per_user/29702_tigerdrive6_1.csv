Catch Me If You Can," Refreshing, enjoyable movie
","This certainly wasn't a masterpiece, yet it was refreshing and enjoyable and it featured a few of today's best actors (Hanks, Walken). Compared to the competing unoriginal works in theatres, Catch Me If You Can proved to be a fun, satisfying piece. This would be your best bet to satisfy your movie-going hunger. That is, of course, if you have already seen Two Towers.",Null,0,1,26 January 2003
