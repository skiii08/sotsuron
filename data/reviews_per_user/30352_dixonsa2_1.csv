The Ring," Audiences simply won't know what hit them.
","I walked into the sneak preview of The Ring already having seen Ringu, and admittedly, I had my doubts about Hollywood's ability to 'remake' the Japanese original without ruining it.Rather than terming The Ring a remake, I prefer to consider it an American interpretation, and extremely successful one at that.  Almost all of the new material deepened the film without sabotaging it.  I left the theater ever more engrossed in the story and excited to see it again on opening night. My friends who joined me also said they would definitely see it again.Let's hope for a just as great American sequel (and maybe the prequel too).",10,0,0,13 October 2002
