Mission: Impossible III," Pointless
","I wish I hadn't wasted my time! This was pretty much Alias starring Tom Cruise, with elements of Lost. It also included something I can't stand in movies, when many innocent, good, or bad-but-low-level people are killed in order to save one person. Stupid! A high point was that the newly-rescued female actually rose to the occasion and rescued her rescuer, instead of pulling a Buttercup-vs-the-ROUS pathetic copout. So that's why I give it a 3 instead of a 2! Will we ever see Tom Cruise play a character who actually dies? I hope it will happen in my lifetime. Also be warned in case you didn't know that Philip Seymour Hoffman plays the bad guy. He was one of the reasons I let myself be talked into seeing this but if I had known that he was the bad guy I might have saved myself a couple hours.",3,1,2,8 May 2006
Moana," I actually enjoyed this
","I only ever watch Disney movies because my daughter wants to see them. This one is the first one that never once made me cringe! A good story with an admirable protagonist and some really good songs. Moana's relationship with her grandmother was well-done and touching. I hope that future Disney musicals will be this good, because my daughter's only five so I guess I have a few more years of watching them. Until Moana, Frozen was the only Disney movie that had ever moved me to tears. Now the list is up to two!It's hard to think of anything else to say that wouldn't be a spoiler. I found myself wondering how much the story is grounded in actual Polynesian culture, traditions, religion, and how much they just made up from scratch.",7,2,12,30 November 2016
Yesterday," Gave my family a lot to talk about
","In my household, we have two adults, a teenager, and a third-grader. We don't often all like the same movie, and when we do, it's usually a superhero movie. We all liked Yesterday, and it gave us a lot to talk about all weekend. The story was great, the plot just the right mix of 'what you know will happen because you saw the trailer' and 'totally unexpected but makes a lot of sense!'Patel, James, and Fry (the actors I wasn't already familiar with) were great as regular people dealing with huge events. Ed Sheeran and Kate McKinnon were both fabulous as people already in the industry, in their own ways.The large and small inside jokes were completely satisfying. I recommend this movie to all, except those who not only dislike the Beatles' music (I like it OK), but also despise the Beatles as a historical popular phenomenon and wish they and their legacy *would* be expunged from history. Actually, even those people might enjoy this movie. What if?",9,0,2,29 July 2019
The Matrix Reloaded," very disappointing (spoilers)
","_The Matrix_ is one of my favorite movies, but _The Matrix Reloaded_ disappointed me. There were some good plot ideas, but way, way too many characters and too much complication.*SPOILERS THROUGHOUT*The Morpheus-Naiobi-commander love triangle was pointless. The dialogue (especially within this love triangle: What are you doing? What I have to. Why? Because some things change...and some things don't. Arrgh!) was dumb.I have to admit that it is not the Wachowskis' fault that people in love (Trinity & Neo in _Matrix Reloaded_) are less entertaining than people on the verge of falling in love (same in _The Matrix_). However, it must be somebody's fault that there is zero chemistry between Carrie-Anne Moss and Keanu Reeves. Somehow, they're more sexy fighting side by side than lying side by side.The fight scenes were interesting but too long. When Neo fights the many, many Smiths, it's obvious from the beginning that the only way he's going to get out of this situation is to fly away. On the brighter side, his launch method is both cool and groovy and a really good use of special effects.I could have used about half as much technobabble from the Architect. They should have called him the Impressive Architect, a la the Impressive Clergyman from _The Princess Bride_. Come to think of it, maybe what this movie lacked was a sense of humor.And Morpheus's non-speech to the teeming mass of that--dance hall, or whatever it was in Zion was just embarrassing. I hope that Laurence Fishburne gets some better material to work with in _Matrix Revolutions_.
_The Matrix_ was so good in so many ways that it was almost inevitable that its sequel would not measure up. Still, I expected better than this.",3,0,0,19 May 2003
