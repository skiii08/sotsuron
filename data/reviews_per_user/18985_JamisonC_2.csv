Spartacus," A Little Long But Worth It.
","I only know part of the complex story behind this production.  Thewriter, Trumbo, received his first credit after being jailed by theHouse Un-American Committee.  Some of the most crucialscenes were removed because of the MPAA.  Thankfully, therestored extended version is amazing.  Kubrick came to the projectlate and didn't like the script or the lead actress.  Unfortunately, hereplaced her with Simmons; she's a decent actress, but the plotdepends on her being a gorgeous woman, which she's not.  Thisis Douglas' finest performance (that I've seen).  A great epic moviewith a famous poster by Saul Bass.  This is the story of a rebelmade by rebels, and they changed Hollywood in the process. Bravo!",9,0,3,23 January 2004
The Big Blue," The Original Cut.
","The two hour original American cut of this film is much better thanthe extended DVD version.  Most of the changes weakened thefilm.  I am searching for the original version on DVD - it is one ofmy favorite films.  Extremely beautiful, poetic, and charming. Direction is excellent, acting is great, and the story is enjoyable.",10,1,2,17 January 2004
