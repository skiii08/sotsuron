Casablanca," Good movie
","Having often heard this title thrown around for years it does live up to its hype. This takes place in the south of France during WWII. The main character is an American who has chosen to start up a club in the city of Casablanca. Humphrey Bogart plays Rich, the American as he is split between choosing the love of his life or saving her and her husband who is a resistance fighter against the Nazi's. The movie was a little controversial because it was released to the general public after the attack on Pearl Harbor and after we entered the war against the axis powers; but before we knew that we were going to win the war.This is reflected in the movie and shows our hopefulness as by the end of the film Rich chooses to step up and fight against the Nazi's as he once did before opening his club.I believe this was a reflection of the WWII era as his actions reflect the action the USA took during the years prior to Pearl Harbor. What I mean by this is during the early years we would sell guns and supply the allied powers with aid but when the war came to our doorstep we stepped up and did what was right. I think movie goers at the time really enjoyed this movie for that reason. Overall I would have to say this was a very good film for the earlier 1940's era of film making. The use of light in the film was done brilliantly as an almost precursor to the Film Noir genera which would come later in that decade. By this I mean the use of light to set the mood of the scene as either a dark gloomy feel with very little light and the use of shadows to open shots with much light to show a lighter more comical side of Rich.",7,1,3,22 April 2014
The Grapes of Wrath," Historically Reflective and a good work for the early 40's
","The grapes of wrath is more than just an entertainment piece. The film reflects the real world struggles of the Great Depression and specifically the devastating effects of the dust bowl. The movie begins innocently enough with a man asking for a ride. We later find out this man has just been released from jail and is on probation. He comes home to an empty house and the news his family has lost his land and thus their source of income and survival and from here the family makes their journey across the county suffering many hardships along the way.Being released just a year after the Great Depression officially ended in 1939 many movie goers related to this film like nothing they had ever seen. It stands today as a reminder of the struggles that we as a nation have overcome and the strength of the average American family.Besides its historical significance the film was also a major success for the style of the early 1940's. It combined studio setting with location setting which was typical of the time. It was also directed by Ford which resulted in much of his style which included many long and medium range shots. The use of light was typical for the time, which met it was used to determine between good and bad characters and to set the mood of the over all scenes in the film. One example of this includes a scene where the corrupt cops beat and kill a friend of the family. in this scene it is the lack of light that makes it typical for the time period. Overall it is a very well made film and a good movie with historical significance and a good plot that was only enhanced by John Fords unique directing style.",8,0,1,23 April 2014
Singin' in the Rain," Great movie
",Was a really great movie and not what I expected from a musical. Most of the movie in fact is not a musical in the sense we think about today. Most musicals i have watched from the modern era are really over the top and over use singing to the point of destroying the store or plot of the film.I am happy to say that this film does not beat you over the head with a song in every single scene. It sticks to a great plot line with a lot of funny and corny jokes and a little slap stick humor thrown in to break up the seriousness.The plot is also great. Basically it begins with an actor and his delusional co-star 'girlfriend'. He tries to escape the event he is attending one night without anyone seeing him and finds himself in a sweet women's car who he is surprised to learn may be the one girl who doesn't really fall head over heels in love with him immediately. he seeks a relationship with her but is turned down. This of course only serves to make him want her even more. After shooting a film with His co-star the producer informs them that sound in a film is the new hot thing and they must immediately change the silent film into a movie with sound. This would be but his co-star is a complete idiot and can learn how to talk into a hidden mike. They record the best the could with sound and on the night of the premier they get to see how good the film now with sound would turn out and it was a complete failure and everyone including the himself hated it. With no other options the actors lose faith until they women he met in the car suggest a way to save the film and that was to turn it into a musical. This was going to save the film except the fact that his co-stars voice was worse than her acting. So they come up with a plan to dub over her voice with the girl he meet's voice which ends up saving the film and she gets recognized as a new up incoming star.,9,0,1,9 May 2014
Psycho," Stands the test of time
","I feel that this movie is a classic that all people should watch, especially those who like scary movies. Psycho was released in 1960 and is often the most remembered film from that era. The film uses a great use of lighting by combining low key with high key lighting styles. Low key lighting in the film was used to show eerie settings and to emphasize they mystery of what is really going on their and in the house which is located directly behind the motel which a good portion of the film takes place in.In the film Marion is a respectable lady who is in a relationship that is strained by financial burdens. When a high rolling customer comes into her work looking to buy a house in cash. She is entrusted with the cash and told to put in in the bank immediately. She doesn't do this though. Instead she takes the money and goes on the run. Unfortunately for her she runs into Norman Bate's who runs the bates motel. She takes a room and appeases Norman by having dinner with him. As they are talking she offends Norman when talking about his controlling mother. So Norma does the normal thing anyone else would do and kills her in the shower while dressed up as his mother. This scene is now one of the most know pictures in Hollywood now. After he kills her a private detective comes who is tracking down Marion. he asks to many questions for Normans liking so naturally Norman also kills him too. Norman is later caught thanks to Marion's lover and sister investigating the house behind the hotel when they find the decomposing body of Normans mom. It turns out that normal went crazy and took on and acted as his mother ad Norma but in the end committed to the role of his mom and psychologically in his head became his mother. This is who the name of the movie is Psycho because he was in fact a Psychotic lunatic.",10,1,2,9 May 2014
