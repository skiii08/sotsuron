Million Dollar Arm," Simple, honest and heartwarming if not astonishing
","Million Dollar is a charming sport-biopic about how two Indian village youngsters Rinku Singh (Suraj Sharma) and Dinesh Patel(Madhur Mittal) transform into American major league baseball players with the help of sports agent JB Bernstein (John Hamm). While the story is undoubtedly predictable and formulaic (also being a Disney production), the positive thing the movie offers are its lovable characters and light atmosphere not stressing the viewer much. The Million Dollar Arm, a contest put forth by JB, to find baseball talent in India where sport of cricket is a religion. Even if there are similarities in cricket and baseball, the two guys who eventually do the best had ironically no interest in cricket whatsoever. Anyways after topping the contest, Rinku and Suraj are flown to U.S. for training with Tom House (Bill Paxton). Along with them is Amit (Pitobash Tripathy) who is Indian local baseball fanatic who also acts as translator for both Rinku and Suraj. The boys being transferred into an amusing alien environment of U.S. , JB finds it hard to get these three used to the surroundings. JB also has tough time balancing his personal and professional life. The boys who are not yet adjusted,find it difficult to give even a justifiable performance and JB starts getting furious. Then we have the regular mentor-student conflicts where in the end both parties end up respecting and valuing each other.Even if the story did not have anything new, but it did have interesting and enjoyable character with whom I could easily connect. Both Suraj Sharma (Life of Pi fame) and Madhur Mittal (Slumdog Millionaire fame) give a justifiable performance as two young Indian villagers who find their destiny. John Hamm was okay while Bill Paxton is always a delight to watch. But the character I liked the most was Amit with a innocently funny act by Pitobash. He was key in bridging the gap between the boys and JB. A.R. Rahman's score with an Indian touch was very effective even if it wasn't his best. The movie captures the Indian culture very pleasingly. I felt really inspired to see how these ordinary boys became stars. Overall despite having nothing stellar plus being heavily predictable, Million Dollar Arm was worth a one time watch thanks to is charming characters plus feel-goodish story.RATING: [2.5/5]",5,1,2,30 January 2015
The Equalizer," One man show
","The Equalizer is just another generic and stylized Hollywood action thriller powered by its lead man Denzel Washington. The story is nothing new and blandly predictable. Only a person who has never watched a Hollywood action film in his entire life would like this screenplay. Denzel Washinton plays a mysterious man in his 40s named Robert who seems to possess highly professional skill sets of CIA agents type. He is seen settling with a peaceful normal life till he crosses path with a young girl Alina (Chloe Grace-Moretz). Alina is a prostitute and is need of serious help when she is badly beaten by some arrogant client and faces threats from her mobster Russian bosses. Steps in our Superhero 'The Equalizer!' cleaning up the bad guys in matter of seconds. The mob kingpin in Russia Pushkin sends his best skilled man Teddy (Marton Csokas) to get rid of our hero and the battle begins. Honestly I felt the pacing was slow and boring whenever there was no action involved. Talking of the action our hero seems to have solution to any situation just like Liam Neeson in Taken and at the end of the we all know what is the outcome of the story.Despite many of its shortcomings I must admit both Denzel Washington's acting and character were both kick-ass and very much likable. Robert, a man who is willing to help anyone in trouble and lives a simple selfless life. Who wouldn't like such a person. The action scenes were cool (ignoring the clichéd slow-motion shots), the way Robert examines the situation before he strikes was awesome. The bad guy Teddy was nothing more than typical Russian bad guy in Hollywood films. Chloe's role felt more like a guest appearance rather than supporting. The background score was bit too melodramatic. Overall I felt the film was quite boring. I would suggest this film only for action lovers who want the protagonist to come out unscathed magically from any situation and beat the hell out dozens of bad guys single handed and also for fans of Denzel Washington. Others should not bother.RATING: [2/5]",4,5,8,4 April 2015
John Wick," Maybe not my taste..
","I believe action movies are not quite my thing, as most Hollywood action is generic these days. John Wick the latest one I saw, is overall quite similar to another recent action flick The Equalizer. One retired specialist is brought back in action to destroy an entire mafia gang. It may entertain hardcore action lovers, but for me its utter boredom. At least, The Equalizer was backed up with some story, which is almost absent here. John Wick is an ex-hit-man who had retired to leave peacefully with his wife. Unfortunately she dies o cancer and all John Wick is left with is his super-cool Mustang and the dog his wife leaves as a gift. But John is pulled back into the action when his car is stolen and dog killed by the mafia head's son. Driven by grief and revenge he decides to take down the people involved using his super-hit-man skills. That's basically the entire story and what fills the 100 minutes is routine monotonic action sequence. They are not bad being nicely shot and well-choreographed actually. The problem is the lack of intent and the totally predictable nature of the script which made it less engaging. There aren't any twist in the story too which is surprising. Just plain straight forward action. If that's all you I believe you will end up having a good time.Just like in The Equalizer, John Wick easily kills dozens of men failing to do so only twice and both the times escapes in what I would say the lamest part of he script. I found it hardly realistic. There is absolutely no tension built up as you know that John Wick can easily kick everyone's asses. Character build up is weak, dialogues just forward the action sequences and acting nothing special. Keenu Reeves gives an honest attempt though, still I couldn't connect with John Wick that much to completely root for him. To end, this was just another forgettable action film for me.RATING: [2/5]",6,1,5,22 May 2015
Meet the Parents," A nice passable comedy
","Saw this one on a boring afternoon and I was quite entertained. The title of the movie explains itself. A guy meets his girlfriend's parents. As usual he has to prove he is the man to her father, who is not quite convinced of that. Ben Stiller and Robert De Niro both give great performances which takes just average comedy to the good level. There are many laugh out loud moments and also some silly gags here and there. I haven't seen much of Ben Stiller except in 'Night at the Museum' series, he really shines out here. The story is quite predictable but humor is there every now and then to keep you hooked. Also we all know how it is going to end,nothing new in that zone. Not much to talk about, all I would say its worth a watch.RATING: [3/5]",6,0,2,6 December 2014
Fury," The expendables of WWII.
","'Fury', is a heroic tale of a tank going by the same name and its crew. It tries its best to be a realistic war movie but unfortunately it feels like a typical blockbuster action flick where the heroes carry out missions with impossible odds and the enemies are ridiculously dumb. The writing here is very poor. The production values are great; all the tanks, warfare, costumes are very good. The background score by Steven Price is also arousing. Cinematography was also good. Its doesn't fail to portray the gritty and horrific effects of war. You get the entire feel of war. But the characters were very clichéd and boring. Acting was nothing great, Brad Pitt was way better 'Inglourious Basterds' compared to this average act. The dialogues were repetitive and there was not a single thoughtfully quotable line. Many scenes felt unnecessary and filler, like the one involving the 2 German women. The ending maybe again bit too far fetched, unrealistic still it was heroic and worked for fine. 'Fury' is worth a shot if you just want some heroic war action with big stars like Brad Pitt, but bad clichéd writing destroyed the potential the movie had.RATING: [2.5/5]",5,24,50,18 April 2015
The Maze Runner," A run into darkness
","Another typical young-adult book adaptation. Despite me falling into that category this movie failed to amaze me. I have not read the books though. The themes of the movie are similar to our recent hunger games,divergent series where our mighty youngsters need to survive in difficult environment. Here their mental,physical and emotional limits get tested leading to a result which we already now. I would prefer both 'The Hunger Games' and 'Divergent' over this one any time as they had better performances, story and direction. 'The Maze Runner' has many problems, the main one being keeping the audience in the dark till the last second. The ending does no justice to the questions raised in it. All it says is see you next year, where your doubts will be cleared in the sequel.The plot involves a group of youngsters put in an environment surround by a maze. Who put them there? Why they are put there? for getting those answers you will have sit through patiently. To get out of there they need to solve and get out of the maze. Wont go too deep into the premise as its the most interesting thing in the whole movie. In first half an hour we get introduced to their lives with the help forced dialogues and then follows not so unpredictable action in the maze.Thomas played by Dylan O'Brien is actually the lead character put the script fails to do justice with that respect. Also acting front everyone is just average except Thomas Brodie-Sangster as Newt. Really liked his acting in Game of Thrones. Even if there are some tense running sequence through the maze which are portrayed with neat CGI, the script fails to put forward the objective of the characters properly. Also many concepts in the film are quite illogical even in sci-fi front. All the while the suspense is built on why there is the maze?, why this guys put in there? but the narrative fails to hold onto it consistently that at the end I wasn't quite bothered with assumption that it all is going on in the mind of some character. Adding to it the end reveal was quite lame and the cliffhanger rather than making me excited towards the sequel and franchise it made me realize it wont be worth the time. Still its not terrible, there are some engaging action sequences but the script is weak. I would give it a high 2 out of 5, which will be somewhere between below average and average.RATING: [2/5]",4,0,2,6 December 2014
12 Monkeys," Not some monkey business.
",12 Monkeys is a fine time-travel based sci-fi movie. Its smart and filled with outstanding performances by Bruce Willis as lead and Brad Pitt in supporting role. James Cole(Bruce Willis) gets sent back in time to save humanity from an apocalypse set up by a unknown virus infestation. It begins nicely but soon loses focus. But its Brad Pitt playing a lunatic who saves the day in the asylum where Willis ends up after being sent into the past.This is one of the best performance he has given till date.The best thing about the movie is that it generates suspense in the minds of the viewers whether it is time travel or just mind games of Cole.The script is neat focusing on variety of things that happen in this corporate system. Also another positive of the film is the character played by the lovely Madeleine Stowe which is of Cole's psychiatrist. She adds the required charm in this dark time-travel loop. The ending is marvelous and really fits perfectly for the questions raised by the time-travel in the movie.I would have liked it more if it had developed more interesting thoughts in the middle rather than using the same ideas. Anyways its worth a watch for all sci-fi fans.RATING: [3.5/5],7,0,0,11 November 2014
The Babadook," Innovative and smart which would entail you to watch it again but you would hesitate as it's dauntingly creepy
","The Babadook is 2014's best horror film without any doubt. In recent years we got really good films like The Conjuring and Oculus in the worn-out genre of horror. The Babadook sits on top of both. But take a note that this not your typical horror movie filled with jump-scares alongside sudden loud noises to scare you. You need to watch the movie closely and try to understand what is the idea underlying the creepy monster called 'The Babadook'. The film opens with a dream sequence of a woman Amelia (Essie Davis). We learn that the dream was of the car accident in which her husband died 7 years ago. She was in labor and her husband was taking her to the hospital when the whole incident happened. Ever since, Amelia has raised her son Samuel (Noah Wiseman) alone. Amelia who is still plagued with the depression and hassles of daily life rarely sleeps. Adding to it, Samuel stars displaying erratic behavior of being scared of an imaginary monster making Amelia comfort him every night by reading storybooks. Things get worse when one night they go through a strange book named 'The Babadook' which describes a weirdly-scary monster with same name. It scares the hell out of Samuel and seems to have a bad effect on Amelia too. Samuel starts talking to others about The Babadook making people think weird of him. Amelia and son start getting more isolated from the society and feel scary things at night. We may have seen the mom and child against the ghost many times but the story here is intelligent and very well scripted. The ending was a bewildering, making you rethink whether you caught hold of the things perfectly.The story builds up slowly whether you like it or not, but it is the essence of a good suspenseful horror. It nicely imprints characters of Amelia and Samuel in our minds and their mother-son relationship. Since her husband died on the same day Samuel was born, deep within her she feels her son was responsible for all the troubles they are going through even if on the top she lovingly takes care of him. At the same time the son loves her a lot more and has the usually 'dont worry mom, I am there to protect you' feeling. But he also soon starts to understand what lies buried deep within his mom's feelings. Even if The Babadook is portrayed as a horror element, it has a metaphorical view point of grief and despair in our life which soon starts to take our bright hopeful side. Actually, I feel the movie was made to metaphorically relate to our daily lives. Still, it doesn't degenerate the horror aspect of the film. The gradual yet perilous consumption of the lives of Amelia and Samuel by the relentless scares of The Babadook will remain with you even after a long time of viewing. The atmosphere generated and setting of the house, with fine cinematography is sad and chilling which was very much necessary. Plus, the soundtrack had the same required tone and blended in smoothly with the scary scenes with crisp editing. Acting wise both Essie Davis and Noah Wiseman do a splendid job, it is rare to see such good acting in horror films.The Babadook will stay in your minds many hours after you finish watching the film, may it be in form of the monster from the creepy book or a monster hiding under plain sight in our daily lives. I really liked the way it is quoted 'You can't get rid of The Babadook' signifying that bad things will always be there in our lives but it is in our hands to conceal it. Many aspects in the film can have more than a single interpretation, leading to good amount of discussion about it with others who liked it. There is a lot of ambiguity in many places where I feel a bit more plausible expansion would have been better. In the end, I was really impressed by the film and also believe there are still many small things that I didn't catch which would have added more to the story on first viewing. I will watch it again soon, but right now am too creeped by the weird tone of the film. If you liked mind-bending movies like Enemy, Oculus of 2013 or have taste in psychological horrors like Black Swan or even if you are a horror fan wanting to see something interesting I recommend not to miss this one.RATING: [4/5]",8,4,10,15 January 2015
Terminator Salvation," A wasted opportunity
","I never wanted another Terminator movie after the disappointing 'Rise of the Machines'. It would have needed great directorial and writing skills to make the story of a protector and terminator sent back in time entertaining to watch again. But unlike anything like that the premise of this one is interesting, set in 2018 after events of Judgement Day with an ongoing Man vs Machine war. When I saw name of Christian Bale in the cast I got excited. The movies opening credits are similar to the original 'The Terminator' with an upgraded version of the original theme with solid sound effects, wow more excitement. But alas! All this excitement gets washed down so badly between the opening and closing credits.Okay firstly film is barely focused, I didn't not understand what was the ultimate goal it was trying to achieve. Sam Worthington's character Marcus was very enigmatic and just doesn't fit into the Terminator universe already established by the first 3 films. With almost whole story centered around the great leader 'John Connor' speculated in the franchise is barely given such greatness. Christian Bale was tries his best with John Connor, the character the script fails to put in spotlight. Even though this John was more leader-like than Nick Stahl's in T3 still his actions had lack of motivation. It was all pale and boring. The post apocalyptic environment created is nice but it falls short on the fearful touch. I know the T-800s were not created yet but come'on there was a lack of terrifying bad-ass terminator. The HKs weren't quite dreadful and I don't know from where suddenly a that huge Transformer like robot came out of nowhere. The moto-terminators were cool though. Also the first half where Marcus meets up with Kyle Reese felt like just existed to induce some action and so that later Marcus can tell Connor later that he had met Kyle Reese. At least Terminator 3 had some cheesy humor and thrilling chases but there were no laughs here. Yes, its post-apocalyptic setting that doesn't mean the humans don't loosen up a bit. The legendary 'I'll Back' statement gets another go and my god it felt so forced. Arnold not being cast is acceptable considering the premise of the film, but the usage CGI Arnold instead of what could have been a nice special appearance was simply pathetic and cringe-worthy.Okay, the movie gets many things wrong still it was a honest attempt with the post-apocalyptic setting and plot instead of recycling the same time-traveling terminator chase plot. The sound effects were really great if not original. Also same goes to CGI. Technically it is much better than T3. The duo of Kyle Reese and Star was really lovable but unfortunately gets very less screen- time. The movie has lot explosions and boom blast action. Despite all that the story is not very bad as the recent Transformer movies, if they had involved Kyle Resse a bit more it would have been very nice.Terminator Salvation can be considered as a flawed spin-off try.RATING: [2/5]",4,0,4,6 January 2015
The Terminator," Original and classic sci-fi action
","After hearing many times to watch terminator series and seeing good reviews finally saw all the terminator movies over the weekend. Being a big fan of sci-fi genre, must say this movie establishes another incredible sci-fi universe like alien,matrix,etc. even though last 2 movies were disappointing. Even if the effects looked very dated, still its a evergreen classic which will be remembered for a long time. The dreadful and menacing 'Terminator' played stylishly by Arnold Schwarzenegger is one of his career defining roles. It feels like he was destined for the role. The Terminator Theme by Brad Fiedel with the clanging metal matches the character of Terminator perfectly and is one of the best themes of all time alongside likes of Star Wars. James Cameron makes skillful use of low-budget effect with a wonderful story. I admired his work in 'Titanic' and 'Avatar', but now I have realized his best work dates back in the 1980s-90s with the best film being 'Aliens'. A mysterious looking man with no clothes on emerges out of nowhere in L.A. in 1984, he seems to be hunting a woman named Sarah Connor. Similarly another man also emerges who is also looking for the same woman. As it turns out this latter guy is there to protect the woman from the earlier mysterious guy who isn't actually a man but machine called 'Terminator' whose mission is to kill Sarah. Both are sent from a post-nuclear war future where man and machine are fighting, and the fate of Sarah is very important in the whole premise. Well the film kind of shows that the Discovery of Arnold's character is a Terminator a surprising moment as enough suspense gets built up. But since we are already told in the beginning that in future there man vs machine war, so I wouldn't consider it as spoiler. Also as soon as you have time-travel involved in Sci-fi movies the emergence of some paradox is imminent unless you draw line or stick with assumptions. The whole franchise is affected by it, but I feel its the least in The Terminator.Keeping aside the time-travel the movie's spotlight is its horrific and suspenseful pursuit of Sarah by Terminator. Machines have no feelings like emotion or fear, thus the ruthless Terminator has become like a horror icon! Also there are scenes of the future earth where the nuclear war destruction and the terror of the machine ravaging the lives of humans.These make of think of the path the human race is headed. Brad Fiedel score makes the atmosphere even more scary. Here we have another blend scifi-horror like the 'Alien' and 'The Thing' only with more action. But what makes Terminator a classic on its own is its characters and story. Both Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn were excellent. Without any doubt Arnold was bad- ass and the best. Also I got to enjoy the famous dialogues like 'I'll be Back' or 'Come with me if you want to live' which have become so iconic that all the terminator sequels use them so as to entertain the fans of this original film. The pacing is slightly slow but suspense keeps you engaged. Overall if you think of time it was released, it is a classic and breakthrough film in its genre. Despite not having great effects and me watching it at a time where sci-fi movies aren't that rare 'The Terminator' entertains a lot. It is because it has great story and splendid characters and acting. The thing many special-effect driven sci-fi movies miss nowadays. RATING: [4.5/5]",9,3,3,5 January 2015
Horrible Bosses," Good enough fun
","3 friends Kurt (Jason Sudeikis), Nick (Jason Bateman) and Dale (Charlie Day) are seriously fed-up of their annoying bosses. They are so fed-up, that they plan to kill them off. Since having no idea to how to carry out the plan they seek for a hit-man and bump into Jones (Jamie Foxx) whose first name I can't mention here. He tells a ridiculous story about how he got that name. As they then try to execute their plans, we get their goofy stuff which forms most of the gag.The story feels a bit forced though. The first half comparatively was much better and hilarious. The humor in the relations between the 3 of them and their bosses is well executed. The cast is quite good, Kevin Spacey shines in the role of one the bosses and as does Jennifer Aniston. Jamie Foxx and Colin Farrell also worth a mention are the most funniest of them all. The lead- trio share a nice chemistry and even if unoriginal they fill in the shoes just fine. There are many hilarious scenes, my favorite one is when when Dale is left outside in car while other 2 are in Nick's boss's house. The humor is mix of dark and goofy which makes it enjoyable in much wider band and good acting backs it up nicely. Entertainingly funny and worth a shot.RATING: [3/5]",6,1,1,23 May 2015
American Sniper," A patriotic biopic which is not quite captivating as it unfolds, but Bradley Cooper's committed performance alone makes it worth a shot.
","As the closing credits roll, I believe the American audience would be stunned by chronicles of Chris Kyle, the deadliest sniper in American History. Now will the Non-Americans be equally stunned by the experience? Of course. I wouldn't say equally, but remarkably enough depending upon your sentiments about army-people. American Sniper puts forth the patriotism and heroism of U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle who is gifted with enormous talent and accuracy in shooting. With record number of Sniper kills associated with him, he saved countless lives on the battlefield and and had soon become a 'legend'. Now I don't want to draw any comparison with what is depicted in the movie and what actually happened, I will just review it as an independent film.Chris's father told him and his brother to always be the 'sheepdog', the protector who will go to any extent to provide protection from the evil. Initially Chris was just a cowboy, but after watching US embassy attacks in Kenya on TV he decides he has got more to his life and joins Navy SEALs. At the same time he marries Taya (Sienna Miller) a woman who initially said to him she would never marry a Navy SEAL until she falls for Chris. His first deployment was in Iraq, where he faces a tough situation where a woman and kid try to attack them with grenade. With his pinpoint accuracy he takes both them down as his first kills leaving their troops safe. It does look plain and simple on screen, but from the point of view of the man about to pull the trigger whose decision is going to decide another person's fate its a whole different scenario. Over his first tour, Chris kills numerous people and keeps getting more and more recognition. He talks to his Wife who is pregnant over phone time to time. After returning from his tour, he and Taya have a boy. Despite being home with his family, Chris still faces the trauma of war zone and at the same time has determination to protect his country. After the 9/11 he is more determined to go back on field and goes on second tour to Iraq. But this time his wife worried about whether he will ever return. Plus, the enemy camp has deadly sniper who was an Olympic medalist and now an opposition for Kyle.Clint Eastwood, as the director at age of 84 brings the realism of war ideally. The war action and shooting sequences are nicely done and edited. Technically the film is really strong, but I wish they did something better than the poor CGI Sandstorm in last part. Based on autobiography with same name, American Sniper does good character study of Chris Kyle and his emotions. Bradley Cooper seems to have put in a lot of effort for building the body apt for the role. Also his expressions on the battlefield have necessary aggression and the touch of conscience at the same time.I doubted the Academy for his nomination, but I was wrong. While character of Chris Kyle gets the necessary focus, but there is nothing interesting to talk about anyone else. Taya his wife, does nothing more than worry about Kyle most of the time. As for soldiers on battlefield, most of the people change over the different missions, leaving Chris the only character to deeply root for. The screenplay though I thought was not as great as the performance and is quite generic. Apart from the few war fight sequences there isn't much meat to fill up its run time. Still it runs for 132 minutes which felt like divided into 4 parts, each one for his each tour to Iraq. And each part starts becoming less and less interesting than the previous.I think we should have seen more development on Chris character when he is back home than on field. Also the war tension is missing mostly apart from few scenes.Like the one moment when Chris has to decide whether to shoot a small kid who tries handle a grenade launcher and he wishing badly that kid drops it, the scene was quite intense. There is lot of violence, one scene was difficult to handle, where a terrorist kills a boy drilling through his head. Oh God! Captures the savagery of the kind animals there are in this world. Another thing I did not like is ridiculously less use of background music, the experience would have been a lot more intense and filled with lot more emotions with a good score.In the end, American Sniper is not very captivating all the way. Bradley Cooper's performance adds the necessary depth to character of Chris Kyle elegantly. While rest of the things don't match up, there is abundance of patriotism. Even if this is overused in films a lot, American Sniper works as a good biopic which doesn't decentralize from its main character. Definitely worth a watch.RATING:[3/5]",6,2,19,17 January 2015
21 Jump Street," Quite entertaining, didn't disappoint
","Comedy is not among my more preferred genres. Its my choice mostly when I am stressed out or bored for refreshing my mind. Starting with 21 Jump Street I was ready to just have some fun whether it made much sense or not. In the end I was quite surprised the movie really invested me in its story not only catching with its gags. It starts off a bit slow but gradually transforms into a fun action- comedy ride.21 Jump Street involves story of two cop-buddies Scmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Chaning Tatum) who are assigned an undercover operation to track down drug dealers and suppliers at their own high school where they had studied. Schmidt is more of a nerd type while Jenko falls into cool handsome guy category still they became very good friends while training at Police Academy. Well there is nothing special about the story, its easy to see the direction in which its heading. Yet the movie is able to put forth a nice enjoyable chemistry between its lead pair. There were some moments involving both of them that were genuinely heart warming which was hugely surprising. Ice Cube who plays the head of the undercover division is also pretty entertaining. Additionally Dave Franco and Brie Larson have smaller roles as students. Romance gets added which wasn't quite the right tone. There is also lot of action with guns firing and car chases but its all balanced out nicely. Among the most funny scenes I would say was the whole driving-school car sequence. There were some really laugh out loud moments.In the climax there is stunning cameo which I did not see coming from any possible angle. I wont say a word about it, enjoy it on your own. The soundtrack and music suit the atmosphere and theme perfectly. But I felt a little problem with flow of the scenes, there are some sudden change from a comic aspect to emotional or romantic one. Lot of profanity is involved much of it seems to be there just to sound cool without making any sense. Phil Lord and Christopher Miller keep film nicely paced without much putting burden over the climax. In the end I wasn't disappointed and had some good laughs. RATING: [3/5]",6,1,1,12 January 2015
Nightcrawler," Jake Gyllenhaal at the top of his game!!
","Nightcrawler is undoubtedly one of the best movies I have seen till now in 2014. Additionally it features an awe-inspiring performance by Jake Gyllenhaal. He was great last year in both 'Prisoners' and 'Enemy' which were both excellent films. The same applies to Nightcrawler which is my current favorite among these.Jake plays Louis Bloom (Lou for short) who is a very disturbing and psychopathic character. He doesn't have a job, makes living on theft but seems highly motivated and shows great commitment in whatever he does. One night he sees a film crew shoot a road accident. These crew film crimes and accidents at night to sell the footage to News Channel at a hefty price.The News Channels use those footage for their morning news. Finding it intriguing, Lou tries to find out more about this occupation. He buys a camera and police scanner and starts a new job becoming a Nightcrawler!! He is aided by Nina (Rene Russo) whom he sells the footage, gets an assistant Rick and soon gets a competitor. The story is the portrayal of the extent to which Lou goes to become best at what he does.Dan Gilroy has a dream directorial debut. He brings out the best out of his own script and also the cast especially Jake. Wow! That was one heck of performance by Jake. May even win the Oscar for him.His eyes always with a cold stare and a devilish grin on his face will be remembered for a long time. He transforms a highly dis- likable psychopath into a star. While the way the character of Lou is committed and uses his talent is inspiring but you wont forget the kind of monster he was.Also you Riz Ahmed's performance as a young likable amateur assistant is worth a mention. His innocence is a nice break in the dark strokes of Lou. Rene Russo as Nina the news station manager desperate to increase the standards and ratings of their news agency brings out a splendid supporting act.Also in a smaller role is Bill Paxton, Lou's competitor. The entire main cast was delight to watch.The pace is slow in the first half an hour. You need to patient but you wont be bored. The camera captures the night in L.A. beautifully and the music was also awesome. James Howard Newton's score is one of the year's best. Once you are set get ready for a thrilling ride. There are moments were suspense reaches epic level that you cant even breath peacefully for some time. The score adds to the effect. The climax was a shocker and was like icing on the cake. Its all a nice pay off for the patient wait. Overall Nightcrawler is one of this years best having an interesting and original premise, with even better execution and outstanding performances.RATING: [4.5/5]",9,1,1,30 December 2014
The Thing," The great horror called The Thing!
","The best thing about the thing is that the thing can look like any living thing. John Carpenter's 'The Thing' is the best scifi-horror movie after Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. I haven't seen any other film by Carpenter but now I am keen as 'The Thing' portrays his talent exponentially. The amount of suspense that gets built here is monumental and that's the ace-point of the film.The film is set entirely in Antarctica where the researchers encounter a strange alien creature called 'The Thing' that can mimic any living thing.It kills the person it copies before taking the form. The cold and isolated location on Antarctica where the events take place induces the scary atmosphere. The music is even more haunting. There is lot of gore so have a strong stomach. Seriously, the detailing is too much. There are many moments in the film where no one has any idea whom the thing has mimicked and the suspense is at its peak.The only major problem with the film is that its doesn't induce varied characterization. There are 12 researchers and none of them stands out among the rest.I don't mean the acting was bad which by the way was excellent, but all of them have similar expression there is no unique character.Also some more interesting sub-plot development was possible which I would liked more, anyways the film is kept tight.The Thing is a must-watch for horror fans and rest can also give it go if they can handle the gore.RATING:[4/5]",8,2,6,11 November 2014
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Rise of the Machines was bound to happen.
","Well just like John Connor says 'It was never our destiny to stop Judgement Day', similarly there was going to be another Terminator movie no matter how nicely the things were brought to a closure in T2. Filmmakers are always waiting to cash on by making unoriginal sequels just to cash on the fame of the original classics. So sick, sequels nowadays are nothing but money grabbing business. I felt relieved when I saw that T2 still grossed more than this unnecessary sequel despite being released way back in 1991.Plot is again a rehash of T2 which was also a rehash of T1 but with a twist. Still what T2 has and T3 misses is a good story. I liked the concept of the Inevitable Judgement Day in T3 even though it violates the Cameron's closure in T2. Still, the film misses many things that would have made it a likable sequel like T2. One of the strongest character of the franchise Sarah Connor is sidelined from the story which ruined the experience, something like the way 'Alien 3' destroyed the positives of 'Aliens'. Arnold's Terminator character kind of feels more like human than machine. The iconic theme of Brad Fiedel is totally missing till the credits roll, even then again it is not entirely used. The terminator T-X is surprisingly pales in comparison to T-1000 of Terminator 2. The dread and ruthlessness of The Terminator was entirely missing, making the chase sequence more cartoonish than horrific. Well yes that's one thing which became enjoyable in this ride of discontent, some clichÃ©d moments like the truck chase similar to T2 yet less appealing, Arnold putting on pink-star glasses only to find it resenting, etc. Parody and comedy felt like nice breaks in mundane action. The characters of John Connor and Katherine Brewster had some nice potential to built up in the story but no the script focuses more on not the so great T-X. Skynet's rise to become self- aware wasn't explained properly. Also they failed to portray John Connor as an effective leader and Nick Stahl felt completely lost. Even Edward Furlong was able to highlight a better and useful 10- year old John Connor in T2. The CGI isn't much special, almost similar to T2 even though T3 was done in a time of more advanced tech. The concept of time-travel can be extensively used to churn out repetitive sequels even though the whole thing is riddled with paradoxes. And that's what T3 does. Rise of the Machines feels pathetic in comparison to its predecessors. Still it has some good action sequences. Also I felt the ending was justifiable even though the path taken was disappointing. T3 is never very boring as such, you just have this feeling of pale discontent.RATING: [2/5]",4,0,2,5 January 2015
Over the Hedge," Simple yet effective entertainment
","I did not know what to expect from 'Over The Hedge'. I had not read any reviews or ratings. Just decided to pass some time with animation film.But after the 80 minutes of unexpected fun I must admit this film is worth at least one-time watch. The plot is simple. A bunch of animals living in a small wilderness come to know about human civilization beyond the hedge boundary. RJ, the raccoon helps them to know about human world and tells them how they can get easy and delicious food from the humans. Soon RJ becomes hero of the pack and is loved by all, also RJ finally gets to have a family. But they are unaware that RJ is collecting food for own personal purpose and will be betraying them.The pacing is brisk, the characters are interesting and the screenplay is funny and entertaining. The dog-chase sequence was hilarious and the Verminator thing towards the end was really bad-ass! I really liked the description about Human Food given by RJ, it really had satirical touch to it. Also it addresses the themes of family and betrayal very well. While overall, Over The Hedge may follow a predictable path but its simple and intriguing fun like no other. Don't miss it!RATING: [3/5]",6,0,0,1 April 2015
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," One of the greatest sequels of all time.
","Generally sequels never reach the cinematic heights of a good original film. But Terminator 2: Judgement Day is not only an excellent sequel but also establishes a landmark in blockbuster cinema-making. Despite belonging to different generation this movie was almost 10 times more entertaining to watch than today's Transformers like crap. The highlights of T2 are its ground-breaking visual effects and awesome sound effects, surprises me that this movie was released in 1991. I know that visual effects only is not a measure of the quality of a film, but one must respect the achievements of T2 for establishing such great use of CGI for the very first time. Keeping aside the effects, the movie is still an excellent sci-fi action with a heart-touching story and memorable characters. Also should not forget the first terminator film which inspired all these sequels, of which only T2 makes remarkable use.It is almost impossible to talk about the plot without giving away one of the biggest shocking moments of cinema history.I really did not see that twist coming. Thus, leave the plot as it is almost a rehash of the previous one. Two guys sent back from the future to finish off John Conner so that he doesn't become leader of the Resistance. Well last time target was John's mother, this time target young John himself. Despite having similar story-line what makes it interesting is the relationship between the characters and great performances especially by Linda Hamilton and also Arnold. Edward Furlong also was lovable as 10 year old John. The action sequences are much grander here than in first film and terminator much more deadlier. Also lot humor thrown in all of which makes it more likable in general. Still the movie has enough sci-fiction elements which make us think and emotional themes to make it heartfelt.Brad Fiedel's score with slightly improved effects was fantastic.All the Oscar's this film got for its effects were well deserved. Unlike the first film which was much more focused and incredibly original, T2 covers different grounds of humanity, love, emotions and relations that kind of dilutes out its dreadful elements of the Terminator which were the focus of first film. Also T2 is much longer than T1 but it has enough content packed. The climax felt a bit prolonged, yet the ending was emotionally satisfying. Cameron has done a outstanding job with another great sequel, it gets all the things a sequels must do spot on. A big thanks to him a creating such an excellent sci-fi world with these 2 films, which gets ruined by its unnecessary and disappointing third and fourth installment. Cameron said his vision ended with this film and he was damn right. Both the Terminator films and 'Aliens' are his best films till date.RATING: [4.5/5]",9,2,2,5 January 2015
The Lego Movie," One of the most refreshing animation film of recent times.
","Many of us have played with LEGO toys in our childhood. Creating our own worlds, characters and stories, building things out of our imagination and creativity. That's where the heart of LEGO movie lies making it a really heart warming ride. Even those who aren't familiar with the LEGO toys will enjoy the stunning animation, humorous script and many of its pop-culture references.The story is set in LEGO universe where everything is made of LEGO bricks. Everyone in this LEGO world follows set of instructions and rules meant for them everyday. Emmet (voiced by Chris Pratt) is an ordinary guy who follows his daily routine/rules and there doesn't seem to be anything special about him. He suddenly becomes a part of a bigger picture when a mysterious object called 'The Piece of Resistance' gets stuck to his back. And here his adventures begin. He encounters some group of peoples called 'Master Builders' and hears some prophecy about the 'Special'. Well most animation films have similar theme about a not so special person discovering his or her potential and specialty. Despite having such a similar theme The LEGO Movies has original feel thanks to its beautiful stop-motion animation. Its dialogues are witty and humorous and sometimes small kids wont understand all of it while adults will enjoy. Still there are stupid gags meant for just kids yet the condition and timing make them laugh-out-loud moments for all. You will be shocked and have a big laugh when you see what 'The Piece of Resistance' actually is. There are also superheroes like batman,superman and even characters from Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, etc. many of them among the master builders. Batman voiced by Will Arnett was ultra-cool and has made me really excited about the LEGO Batman movie coming up. Also Liam Neeson was bad-ass as an alter-ego good-bad cop.The voice-cast is splendid with likes of Morgan Freeman and Elizabeth Banks doing a fine job. Chris Pratt though steals the show with Emmet. The song 'Everything is Awesome' is really catchy. At the end it tries a bit too hard to deliver its underlying message but it is all set in surprising premise so I didn't care much. Watch it on your own I don't want to reveal anything.I hope LEGO Movie wins the Oscar and other awards for best Animated feature of 2014. Its better than last years 'Frozen' for sure. Saw it second time before writing this review so as to make sure me loving it is not just some first time effect and it didn't disappoint. Watch 'The LEGO Movie' now if you are tired of routine animation flicks, its a treat for people of all ages.RATING: [4/5]",7,0,1,2 January 2015
District 9," Neill Blomkamp the new spark in science fiction
","Director/Writer Neill Blomkamp is just at the beginning of his career with 2 films. 'Elysium' of last year was his first film I saw and found it quite good. Now his first feature 'District 9' film is much better and probably a dream debut for any director. Science Fiction being one of my favorite genres I have a feeling Mr. Blomkamp may end up being added to the my list of greatest directors in future, he has already proved it in the sci-fi genre though. The standout point which I liked in his both films is how he highlights the social issues and the feeling of inequality set in our minds.District 9 begins uniquely with a series of documentary type footage explaining the situation. A mysterious alien ship has halted over the city of Johannesburg,South Africa.After 3 month wait humans decide to break into the ship and the discover alien creatures looking like prawns(hence their name) in number more than million stranded in there.These creatures seemed malnourished and are given shelter in slum-like area called District 9 in Johannesburg. Years pass and unrest among people rise due to the presence of these aliens and lack of mutual understanding the two species. Over 20 years they get to know each others languages but co-existence seems difficult. Finally it is decided to move these aliens to another settlement District 10 well outside the city and Wikus van der Merwe (Sharlto Copley) of MNC a company handling the alien affairs is the made head of operations. He and the team needs to issue the eviction notices and get signature of all the aliens for the relocation.The thing that I like about the film is the way it portrays human behavior towards something they don't have much knowledge about. Well this is present in many sci-fi films but District 9 is quite different. We get easily sympathetic towards the situation the aliens are facing. Even if it feels a bit direction-less in its first half but gets really interesting later and filled enough action to entertain those who get bored by mundane sci-fiction.The story is focused on Wikus who has an incident during the relocation operation and his struggle later which later is going the fate of the aliens and his own. Shartlo Copley has done a fine job even if some may find his accent annoying.The CGI is very good, the aliens blend so effectively into the environment that it looks a like a intricately designed costume. I felt the first half had lot of info to chew on that made it less-likable to general audience. Also some elements in the film seem relatively unexplained like the possession of high-grade weapons by the aliens. But still the film looks quite realistic.Music was good and I really liked the documentary style narration.The ending is again quite unique and many may be waiting for a sequel for detailed answers for some questions. Apart from that District 9 is grand debut for Neill Blomkamp. I am not going to miss any of his sci-fiction movies in the future.Rating: [4/5]",8,0,0,1 October 2014
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Remarkably thoughtful and wonderful
","The Grand Budapest Hotel has many dark depressing themes under its colorfully cute and fun moments. With a variety of characters and a peculiar script Wes Anderson is able to grab your attention from the very first minute. The story is set in fictional country of Zubrowka in 1930s. We hear the tale of how Zero Mustafa (Toni Revolori) the lobby boy of the prestigious 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' ends up becoming the owner of the same. He becomes a good friend of the hotel's concierge Monsieur Gustave (Ralph Fiennes). But things take a turn when someone close to M. Gustave dies and he is arrested suspecting of murder. Zero and Gustave embark on a journey to prove the innocence of M. Gustave where they become even closer friends. Ralph Fiennes has given a fine performance and definitely one of the most under-rated actors. We also have Edward Norton in a relatively smaller role and a exciting Bill Murray cameo as well.Anderson gives intricate and vibrant detailing to the sets making visually beautiful. Also the make-up and hair styling department has done a great job. The music and background score is wonderful. With a run time of 100 minutes The Grand Budapest Hotel does not overstay its welcome. It is quirky, weird at the same time entertainingly funny with a heart touching story. Definitely worth a watch.RATING: [4/5]",8,2,4,13 February 2015
Foxcatcher," Chillingly taut
","Foxcather is a slow-burning character driven biopic which may not be to everyone's taste. Audience craving for fast based overly dramatized popcorn flicks will find it extremely boring and will fail to grasp the chilling experience. I feel the slow pacing of Foxcather was necessary to build the cold atmosphere needed for the psychological study the movie does of its characters. The trump card here is of course the acting. With surprisingly masterclass performances from Steve Carell, Chaning Tatum and Mark Ruffalo, it makes you feel every emotion and action of its characters.Based on true events, Foxcather is directly written to screen by Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye. Mark Schultz (Chaning Tatum) is a American wrestler who had won an Olympic Gold at LA 1984 yet he doesn't earn much. We see that is house is small and simple. Mark is mentored and trained by his older brother David Schultz (Mark Ruffalo) who has been taking care of him since his childhood after their parents split up. David also was a gold medalist at 1984 Olympics; he is married and loves his family a lot. Mark on the other hand has a feeling he is living in shadow of his brother. Things take a turn when Mark gets an offer from a billionaire and wrestling enthusiast John E. du Pont (Steve Carell). John seems to have family issues, with his mother who is obsessed more with her horses rather than appreciate his son's achievement and treating wrestling as low sport. Mark starts training at du Pont's high facility 'Foxcather Farm' moving away from his brother who is unwilling to move his family. The movie then touches how this affects the characters and relations. That's basically the plot with a strong character development which is sorely missing in movies nowadays.Foxcather is not an eventful film with dramatic twists every now and then. It is a study of characters and their psychology. The main reason it is effective is the acting. Steve Carell's transformation into a sociopath from his routine comedy-flicks is shocking. I had to remind myself that he is the same comedy star. Same applies to Chaning Tatum whose performance has sadly not got much recognition at the awards. Also not to forget Mark Ruffalo who now really looked like Hulk-wrestler with his body. Director Bennet Miller with help of cinematographer Greig Fraser provide a absorbingly sad and chilling atmosphere. Adding to it is Rob Simonsen's haunting background score. Sometimes the silences and the background score convey more of the story than the actual dialogues in some of the long taut shot. But still, I feel at times Foxcather drags a bit too much in parts, the characters simply pause a lot even during regular dialogues. If the film was about 10-15 minutes short I think it would have been a lot more effective.Overall Foxcather is a deep character study and a psychological drama. The fact that it is based on true events makes it even more chilling. The slow pacing may put off many, but I thoroughly enjoyed the engrossing screenplay and memorable performances.RATING: [3.5/5]",7,0,4,31 January 2015
It Follows," It may be slow, but it is not dumb
","It Follows is like a breath of fresh air in the horror genre. First of all the premise is quite unorthodox and interesting. Secondly it provides a fine blend of psychological horror along with a few jump scares as well. The somewhat ambiguous approach of the film though may face a divided response. The horror element here is something which is referred to only as 'it' and 'it' follows only one target person at a time. A person becomes a target through sexual encounter with a person who is currently a target. Thus one can pass the curse of 'it' to a person by having sex with that person. Interesting right? There isn't much light shed into the origin of 'it' but as the film goes on we learn slowly about the functioning of 'it' but never its origin. The ending is ambiguous and didn't work so well for me this time but considering most of the film relies on ambiguity(ie.how the audience interprets) the ending is fine.It Follows is a slow burning film, so have patience and let the plot and suspense build up. The best aspect I felt was the haunting soundtrack and the strong cinematography. It totally establishes the gloomy atmosphere. The script could have revealed a bit more about 'it' but some open ends are fine for me (might not be for all). There were many loose ends I felt. There may not be any popular faces still the acting was quite believable for an horror film.Another similar recent horror movie comes to mind is 'The Babadook'. Both of these are thought provoking Psychological horror films unlike the rehashed, unoriginal, jumpy and predictably bland horror films we are getting these days. If you liked 'The Babadook' I suggest you don't miss this one. It has its flaws but I would appreciate it for its originality. If you were totally sucked into the film's atmosphere and story then for days you will feel like checking around if someone is following when you are alone. This low budget indie film I believe will be a cult horror classic.Rating: [3.5/5]",7,73,146,27 June 2015
Gone Girl," A bit over the top but Fincher handles it like a boss!
","Gone Girl is one wild ride. The ending itself was kind of absurd and hard to digest at first. But then I realized that I had forgotten what an experience it was. Its portrayal of the extent to which some people go to make sure it is they who are always right is horrifying. David Fincher has be among my top favorite directors ever since I first saw The Social Network. Have seen Se7en and Fight Club apart from that, all three outstanding films. Gone girl is another feather in his cap.On their fifth wedding anniversary Nick Dunne (Ben Affleck) finds his wife Amy (Rosamund Pike) missing from his home. There isn't much to see at the first look of the crime scene except a glass table broken. Nick is asked questions about Amy and her life. It seems like he doesn't know her that much well despite 5 years of marriage. We then move back in time and hear Amy narrating the story with a diary of how she and Nick met and got close. Amy's parents are writers and creators of a famous character called 'Amazing Amy'. 'Amazing Amy' is based on their daughters real life thus making their daughter Amy herself very popular. Now the missing of Amy becomes a very hot topic and suspicions begin to arise about Nick too, who seems quite absent and casual. This is not even 10% of what actually happened and there is a big twist at the half point. Telling about it will spoil your first view.The atmosphere created by the movie has a dark tone thanks to haunting score by Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor who definitely will get another Oscar nomination. The film is also visually splendid especially in the first part in New York where Nick and Amy first meet. I have not read the book but Gillian Flynn's story feels a bit unrealistic at times but the way it is told by the atmosphere created and direction of Fincher you are pulled deep into the movie. There is also a tone of dark- comedy to it at times making it refreshing. The best thing though is the acting. I haven't seen much of Ben Affleck, his first for me and he was very good. Neil Patrick Harris and Tyler Perry have a smaller role, both did a fine job. Its Rosamund Pike though who gives a fantastic performance as Amy which might give a Oscar win as well. You must see the movie to understand me though. Its difficult to review it without spoiling anything.Despite its positives Gone Girl still has flaws and maybe even plot holes. Some things make you ask how, which will make you think a lot. At the end it would good to have our own interpretation. David Fincher is yet to disappoint. This.This one is may not be his best but definitely among the top movies of the year.RATING: [4/5]",8,0,5,17 December 2014
The Theory of Everything," A wonderful and emotional account of the life of an inspiring genius.
","Stephen Hawking is an inspiring figure in field of science. His perspective about the mysteries in our boundless universe have been always hugely thought provoking at least for me. But evidently here emphasis on the scientific aspect is far less compared to the drama and romance. Still watching sensational genius fight the motor-neuron disease struggling to keep up his social life was soul-stirring. Eddie Redmayne's performance is mind-blowing, both physically and sentimentally.The movie's main focus is the relationship between Hawking (Eddie Redmayne) and his wife Jane (Felicity Jones). It opens up in 1963, when Stephen and Jane first meet. The romance is very refreshing, credits to the outstanding acting by both the lead plus the beautiful background score. Stephen's ultimate goal was to deduce an equation that would explain all the mysteries of the universe and its functioning which he termed as 'Theory of Everything'. His path unfortunately hits a huge bump when he is diagnosed with motor-neuron disease which slowly paralyzes his whole body. Jane still loved Stephen for the person he was, giving faith and hope to him and they both get married. Doctors had earlier predicted Stephen would only live 2 years after the onset of the disease yet Stephen determinedly outruns that time (Well at 72 today he is still devoted with science). Jane is struggling to manage their lives with Stephen's disability. After this it gets slightly overdrawn with all the drama in their married life. The science and romantic aspect of the films are highly enjoyable while the drama felt a bit bland. Fortunately it reverts back to science in the ending where Stephen is giving a talk and then following with a beautiful rewind into the his back to time he first met Jane. It was so mesmerizing.Theory of Everything is not perfect. The performances by it leads overpowers the script adapted from Jane's biography. Now I have not read the book, so I can't have a good perspective on that. Felicity Jones as Jane is very charming and lovely, some may find the decisions she took a bit faulty but one must try to understand about the situation she was in. Eddie Redmayne's portrayal of Stephen Hawking is definitely going down as one of best performances in recent times.Wow such great acting seen in 2014. Will be tough-fight at the awards. The lovely score consisting mostly of piano is simplistic still engrossing. The many moments where Stephen struggles with his disability were tear inducing. Even if I wished there was more science stuff included, I would say enjoyed it more considering it as romantic story. This films romance is much better than many romance films we get in recent times. Not forgetting its flaws, The Theory of Everything may not be the best films of the year. It definitely was a wonderful,emotional and inspiring experience. RATING: [3.5/5]",7,0,0,18 January 2015
22 Jump Street," You will enjoy it if you liked the first one.
","21 Jump Street offered many laughs from its dynamic duo of Chaning Tatum and Jonah Hill. While it wasn't anything monumental still was great fun to watch. Now if you didn't feel the same regarding it then I advise you stay away from 22 Jump Street as its nothing more than a rehash of the plot with similar comic situations. Despite that directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller (who gave the wondrous Lego Movie this year) keep us engaged by making the things look very less serious and investing more in the bromantic relation between Schmidt and Jenko established in the first film.Now if you remember what Ice Cube said at the end of 21JS that ' you'll going to college '. Well that's the setting, our undercover cop- buddies need to crack down drug suppliers and dealers in a college now. The way the events unravel is almost same as the first one, still it's not boring as there are some constant gags put in every now and then. Romance again here doesn't fit nicely but there is a very surprising comic twist moment involving Jonah and Ice Cube which was really amusing. I found Ice Cube much more funny in this one. New characters are introduced but they are as interesting as Walters, Eric or Molly of first one, while the earlier two appear for brief amount of time in jail Molly is completely erased. Again the duo of Schmidt and Jenko are the standout. Even if they undergo similar situations where they have their differences for some time but at the end realize they are best buddies. There is also a cameo during the credits but its not as amazing as the one in first film.Overall 22JS is pretty much entertaining but most its credit goes to the nice story established in the 21JS. Also the climax is unnecessarily dragged and quite cliché, I wished they at least come up with an unpredictable ending. The beach and spring break setting for finale doesn't match up to the stylish prom-night entry of 21JS. The credits are more hilarious and fun showing us different mock sequels of Jump Streets, do not miss them. Considering most of the positives of the film are derived from the first one and also since the first one had much better third act I will rate this slightly below the first film. Comedy wise both are enjoyable at the same level, so if you had a good time with the 21 then don't miss 22.RATING: [2.5/5]",5,0,1,13 January 2015
Ex Machina," Subtle and suspenseful with enough food for thought.
","Something about Ex Machina completely engrossed me into it. The 108 minutes smoothly passed away despite the slow-burning nature of its screenplay. Writer and debut director Alex Garland explores numerous ideals related to humanity with a seemingly basic premise and setup. A.I. Robots in movies is nothing new but Garland's visions here are not something you would be able to see if you just scratch the surface.A young nerdy programmer Caleb (Domhall Gleeson) receives a mail that he has won some big coding contest. We see that his face is being unknowingly scanned by his webcam and phone cam. As the prize he gets to spend a week at his company's (Blue Book) CEO's place, which is a luxurious estate amidst beautiful mountains. CEO Nathan (Oscar Isaac) tells Caleb its not a home but more of a research facility. The facility is modern and sleek, the rooms have no window and you have instant claustrophobic feel about it. Nathan tells Caleb is here to perform Turing Test on his creation, Ava (Alicia Vikander) an incredibly advanced A.I. Robot who looks lifelike with skin on her face . Caleb is as stunned as we are watching Ava. She is able replicate human-like behavior with extreme precision and even can perform lie-detection based on micro-expression on our faces!! She is charming as well and we see Caleb & Ava growing fond of each as they interact every day as part of the test. Everything is monitored by Nathan through CCTV cameras. Things seem smooth until one day Ava tells Caleb not to trust Nathan when cameras are shut by power cut. From here on the story takes an unpredictable turn, there is no clue who is right and who is wrong or who is the protagonist and who is the antagonist.The film explores various concepts such the meaning of consciousness and self-awareness, it questions your ethical viewpoint and blurs effectively the line between the human mind and AI. Are AIs truly the next stage of human evolution? Is singularity possible? It explores in these regions in great depth at the same time leaves some things open for interpretation. Adding to it, the film is also a suspenseful psychological thriller where you think every character is not what he/she seems to. And there are only 3 main characters here, all in the claustrophobic setting of the estate. The scene where Caleb cuts his hand to check if himself is a robot was really intense and frightening. There is also one hilarious out-of-the-box dance sequence giving a brief break from the freakish atmosphere. The soundtrack mostly of piano is haunting and beautiful at the same time. The music sets up requisite atmosphere and tone perfectly. The camera work is simply beautiful, be it the external landscape or the sleek interior shots. The production design and special effects are also impressive considering the low-budget of the film. At the end, cannot forget the 3 actors who did a great job. Alicia Vikander I feel nails every expression as the AI Robot and captures your attention in every scene she is present. Domhall as the lonely nerd and Oscar as the alcoholic genius were great too. Debut director Alex Garland shows immense potential and I am very much looking forward towards his next work. Overall, Ex Machina I believe is treat for all the true science-fiction fans and also those who like slow-burning atmospheric thrillers. There is not much superficial robot action here as it is not sci-fi action film. Its a film driven by ideas not by action. Hope you keep that in mind. If you want a movie deeply rooted towards the ideals of AI, Ex Machina is not to be missed. It was intriguing, thoughtful, tense and beautiful in its own way. Absolutely loved it!RATING: [4/5]",8,0,3,4 June 2015
Big Hero 6," Typical animation story yet somewhat distinctively enjoyable
","Here we have 'Big Hero 6', another fun-filled animation ride. Disney made huge profits with last year's musical Frozen. This time they have Marvel's superhero characters featuring. Like most animation films Big Hero 6 will appeal the kids a lot, still its refreshing enough for adults.The story is set in futuristic hybrid city of 'San Fransokyo'. 'Hiro' a teenager who is very bright with technology and robotic stuff but uses most of his talents in back-alley robot fights. His brother 'Tadashi' worried of Hiro's plans decides to take him to his university with robotics labs and futuristic gadgets. Tadashi shows Hiro 'Baymax' an inflated health care robot created by Tadashi. Hiro also meets Tadashi's friends each one good in a particular tech-field and also the head Prof. Callaghan who is impressed by Hiro's talents. Inspired by all this Hiro gets enthusiastic about joining the university. With help of his brother Hiro starts working on a project called 'Microbots' which are tiny programmable robots whose swarm can form any shape and can be controlled with his mind. He presents it at the university exhibition impressing everybody. But every new-tech stuff attracts villains wanting to misuse it and that's how the story follows. No spoilers.Apart from of few twists, the story is pretty much predictable. The relation between Baymax and Hiro is very endearing and is the strong-point of the film. The huge inflated hug able robot Baymax will be loved by kids and adults alike. Also the brotherly- bond between Hiro and Tadshi is nicely put forth. Well the typical robot tries to fit in human environment is used, still the cute interactions between Hiro and Baymax keep us engaged. The second half of the film is more of superhero-action like The Incredibles but it lacks the same humor and thrill. Towards the end it goes into the cliché revenge bandwagon and the ending could be easily seen coming. On the positive side, the animation is incredible like most animated-movies these days and is briskly paced. The music is also good for the superhero theme. Voice-cast does a nice job, Scott Adist's Baymax being the best without any doubt. I had never heard of these superhero characters before wacthing the film, as a origins story I think it does a good job.Overall, I feel the kids will like it a lot more than adults and will be wanting to have a Baymax of their own at the end. I too loved him a lot especially with all the iron-man like upgrades which Hiro gives him, which made him impressively cool besides being adorable already. Other characters apart from Hiro lacked a bit of focus yet were pretty much entertaining. In the end, Big Hero 6 falls slightly short of this years 'The Lego Movie' and 'How to Train Your Dragon 2' for best animated feature, but its just my personal opinion.RATING: [3/5]",6,2,14,10 January 2015
Dumb and Dumber," Crazy, silly, absurd and what not, but delivers what is expected
","As the title suggests, this film is ridiculously dumb. Even if there isn't much of story and whatever is there quite predictable but the characters and their actions are hilariously unpredictable. The characters here Llyod (Jim Carrey) and Harry (Jeff Daniels) who are good-for-nothing goofy friends are innocently admirable and extremely funny. The performances of Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels are one of the best in any comedy film. They take the not so special story to a completely different level. In the end it drags a bit too much, but the first half was lots of fun and entertainment. Much like Home Alone, even after 20 years of release the film holds on very well.RATING: [3/5]",6,0,2,22 May 2015
Guardians of the Galaxy," A step down for Marvel
","Don't get me wrong, 'Guardians of the Galaxy' has everything one might expect from a MCU (Marvel's Cinematic Universe) film - a bunch of superheroes fighting iconic villains, special effects explosion in the climax, an after credit scene and some other scenes here and there to show linkage between films in the franchise. This one also has nice warmth and has its heart at its right place unlike the more dark 'Captain America: The Winter Soldier' but it fails to reach its levels in terms of direction and execution. I just felt like this film was trying to be too simple not quite taking it self seriously which some people may like but the script is neither innovative nor interesting.Chris Pratt plays 'Peter Quill'(aka Star-Lord) who is kind of professional thief. But when he steals an orb which we all later find out is much more than a normal orb all kinds of troubles step- in. On his adventures he is accompanied by Gamora(Zoe Saldana),Drax the Destroyer(Dave Batista) and two most-interesting characters; one called Rocket Raccoon (voiced-Bradley Cooper) who is genetically modified talking raccoon and another called Groot(voiced-Vin Diesel) a mysterious humanoid tree. Both groot and rocket are best friends and partners in bounty hunting, their pair is the best thing in the whole movie. Things get dangerous when our villain some Kree warrior Ronan pops up looking for the Orb and he is the weakest point of the movie. Ronan plans to destroy a planet Xandar and many other planets later using the orb in vengeance of death of as he says 'my father and his father before that'. Ronan just keeps repeating those lines whenever he is supposed to look dreadful which I just couldn't bear. His character was poorly developed which was setback for the whole film.Even though I was overall not happy and disappointed(as I high expectation looking at the reviews) still it has quite many positives going in favor. Special Effects, CGI wise very good but which film in these days doesn't satisfy that? Chris Pratt was quite cool as Star-Lord and his nostalgia for 80s music and dance was also pretty enjoyable. Gamora and Drax seemed a little bit odd but the make-up and styling for them was pretty good. Groot whose vocabulary is limited to 'I am Groot' is lovable but its the Raccoon who steals the show with his witty and funny dialogues. Comedy wise the movie has lot to offer, I was laughing hard quite a lot many times thanks to rocket,groot,even the others sometime.The music and score was good. But all this was entangled in a weak plot and the story which follows. We have the same story where our heroes need to protect some dangerous item from falling into wrong hand,the bad guys then find it and just before use it for destruction they are stopped in a action-packed climax. I know most of marvel movies follow similar path but there is something new here and there but here I felt this was the weakest film of Phase 2.Another thing is the movie is being popularized by many as best sci- fi movie of all time and all. It was just a good action- adventure- comedy and the sci-fi elements in the film weren't properly developed thus I feel it barely falls into sci-fi genre. Many might enjoy it a lot, yes its nice popcorn flick it sit around and watch with friends or kids. For me, it was just one-time watch and slight disappointment looking at the hype of the movie. Still I would give it 6/10 (instead of 5/10) thanks Mr.Raccoon in there, he was one best characters I have seen this year.RATING:[3/5]",6,2,6,30 November 2014
The Imitation Game," Sometimes it's the people who no one imagines anything of who do the things that no one can imagine.
","I Was highly excited about The Imitation Game. Being a student in the field of Computer Science, I try not to miss biopics like this one. Overall it was a very good inspiring experience yet I must say it has quite many flaws. Maybe my expectations were too high. Anyways, have my utmost respect to Alan Turing whose work has been immensely influential in the field of computation and algorithms. Graham Moore's screenplay (adapted from 'Alan Turing : The Engima') boosted by mesmerizing performance by Benedict Cumberbatch does great justice portraying the character of Alan Turing on the screen.The Imitation Game captures Alan Turing's life at three different stages. 1928-When Turing was in school, 1940-when he starts working at Bletchley park to crack the enigma and 1951-police investigation a robbery at Turing's place. While the part I was most excited about was the cracking of the enigma, which is an encryption device used by Germans for war-related communication during WWII. Turing with help of other mathematicians and experts at Bletchely Park like Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) and Hugh Alexander (Matthew Goode) build the 'Bombe', the machine for decryption of German messages so that English would know location of German attacks and plan accordingly. The film though kind highlights Turing a bit too much as if he did it all single handed but he indeed was the mastermind behind the implementation. The childhood part shows Turing's relation with his only good friend Cristopher among gangs of bullies. While the house robbery part of 1951 is where Turing gives account of all the events through his life as narrated in the film when he his being interrogated by the police. There is lot switching back and forth in the timeline of events, which wasn't necessary feeling like a poor trying- to-be-smart effort. There was a lot of potential with the enigma- cracking in the script to genuinely render smartness, unfortunately they only scratch the surface of it. I wished there was more math and actual computational terminology involved.Despite the main core of the film being the actual cracking of the enigma, the back and forth switches kind of kill the intensity and thrill. Also it made the narration lack focus. Keeping those things aside, it does not fail to imprint the glorious achievements of Turing in our minds. Benedict Cumberbatch has given an award-worthy performance in the tough race of outstanding actors in 2014. Keira Knightley was also surprisingly great and delightful to watch. The production design is top notch encapsulating the WWII time ideally. Alexandre Desplat's score is beautiful as most of his works. I was slightly disappointing having too high expectations, overall The Imitation Game is a thrilling,inspiring,charismatic but over- dramatized biopic. RATING: [3/5]",6,2,6,23 January 2015
Taken," Probably one of the best action-thrillers
","Remove Liam Neeson's mind-blowing performance, this film would have been just another generic action thriller. Neeson completely defines this film and is exceedingly likable as a loving father who becomes a merciless killing machine when his daughter is kidnapped by human- traffickers. This may be typical save the kidnapped girl story, but the way it gives edge-of-seat thrills combined with well-oiled action its becomes highly engaging. The sharp dialogues with Neeson's deep voice add to the package. Who wouldn't like Neeson's 'I will find you and I will kill you' dialogue? And the action sequence when he finally finds the bad guys is simply mind blowing. Another of my favorite scenes is when he makes his old friend realize that he has been sitting on desk so long that he has forgotten the difference between a loaded and an empty gun. The plot remains intensely focused on the father's pursuit to find his daughter without floating into unnecessary sub-plots. The only relevant and important characters where the father and daughter, and their relation is well established in first 20 minutes giving room for the audience to invest their emotions. The film also portrays the horrors of human-trafficking giving enough reason for rooting Neeson's character to find and kill all those bad guys. With well choreographed action, engaging soundtrack and slick camera work with power-packed Neeson Taken is a ride not to be missed. I have watched it 5 times now and it was exciting each time. I still remember the first time I saw it about 4 years ago and how it totally blew my mind!RATING: [4/5]",8,1,1,3 July 2015
Selma," Compelling Biopic
","Selma powered by a great performance by David Oyelowo is a well- crafted biopic not diverting even a bit from the fundamentals of Martin Luther King which form the foundation of this film. Director Ava DuVernay doesn't fail to hold your attention with realistic and compelling depiction of the events of the Civil Right Movement which could have felt boring history chapter otherwise. The tone of the storytelling is outright serious and make sure you keep that in mind before deciding to watch it. The story mainly focuses on MLK's campaign in Selma and the historic march for equal voting rights in 1965. Despite the dry nature of the script, it holds your attention thanks to great acting and the resonating themes which it dwells into. With moments be it the energetic speech delivery by Dr. King or the arousing feeling you get while watching the campaigners march hand in hand, Selma really strikes the right chord. 'Glory' which won the Academy Award for Best Original Song is really soul- stirring. The cinematography is solid and captures the unrest among the people perfectly. The screenplay could have been a bit less broad and a bit more stimulating. Despite few of its shortcomings, Selma is a really good biopic and a well crafted film.RATING: [3.5/5]",7,0,1,21 May 2015
Zombieland," Time to nut up or shut up!
","I have now watched Zombieland fourth time and its still great fun to watch. It may not have been as surprisingly fun as first view but Zombieland has good enough rewatch value. More than the comedy I like the feel good theme of film and the way it balances all its drama,horror,comedy,romance and everything else. We all know the plot of any Zombie movie. Here it says some mad cow diseases spread to humans making them mad humans then into mad zombies. Well its absurd but that's not focus of the film. Much of it is about surviving the onslaught of zombies and to find the feeling of being a human in the world filled with these horrid creatures. The story is of 4 such people who are referred to only by the names of the place where they come from. Jesse Eisenberg's nerdy yet disciplined for survival character 'Columbus' meets Woody Harrelson's character 'Tallahassee' who is more of zombie kick-ass with a bit too much love for something called Twinkie. This odd duo meet another duo of sisters Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) who again know all the tricks to survive Zombieland. Romance is thrown in which looked a bit forced but we are busy admiring the uniqueness of each character that it did not matter much.The character of Columbus is hands down my favorite. His set of rules to survive Zombieland which pop up every now and then were absolutely hilarious. The script is highly enjoyable with some really witty and hilarious dialogues. There is quite a lot of gore which wasn't quite necessary but it adds to the horror element. There is also a surprising cameo by a great comedy star and his entire sequence was the funniest bit of the film. At the run-time of only 88 minutes it never gets boring. The cast is only of 4 people (plus the cameo) and everyone else is Zombie. Each one of them was amazing to watch. It is a nice blend of horror comedy with the right amount of drama and thrills. Nothing feels a bit too much thus making it entertaining all the way.I try to avoid Zombie movies because at the end all of them follow the same path. But Zombieland is not only one of the best zombie film among the few I have seen but also a very good comedy film. Even if you don't like Zombie movies watch it. It is really fun, but make sure you can handle some blood and gore. I would give Zombieland a 7/10 but the cameo part was a show stealer.It is one of the most hilarious sequences I have seen so gave it an extra star. RATING: [4/5]",8,0,2,1 January 2015
Whiplash," Intensely absorbing and energetic with two great performances
","Whiplash is only the second movie of 2014 that overly exceeded my expectations (first one being Nightcrawler). Being neither a fan of jazz music nor finding a much stellar cast in this one I must say I was highly impressed. Whiplash is a tightly wound experience that puts forth the intense relationship of a student with his literally brutal mentor. Whiplash provides ample scope for deep study of its characters and their psychology.Miles Tellers plays Andrew Nieman an aspiring Jazz drummer who is confident and talented. One day at his music school the iconic main school band teacher Terrence Fletcher (memorably performed by J.K. Simmons) observers Andrew practicing. He sees some spark in Andrew but isn't fully convinced of what he is capable of. Fortunately for Andrew on another fine day Fletcher storms into their class asking each student to play what he wants and Andrew impresses playing something which he is very good at. Flecther brings in Andrew into the main school band as an alternative drummer. In order to become the main drummer Andrew has to face the seriously exhaustive and physically draining teaching methodology of Fletcher. Fletcher's motive behind all this is to find the next big jazz star in his students for which believes one should defy the limits. While Andrew is highly motivated and inspired climbing the ladder of success slowly but is unknowingly degrading his personal life. He is unable to keep up with his girlfriend and also ends up with family issues. Whiplash tries to portray what we mind end up with trying to achieve perfection in our field. The ultimate successful moment is very rewarding but many of the earlier hardships and sacrifices get overshadowed.Breaking down the various aspects of the film, the thing that stands out is the performances by the two leads. Miles Teller driving the enthusiasm and energy into the character of highly motivated drummer is really inspiring. While J.K. Simmon's pitch perfect portrayal of the furiously scary mentor was raw and brutal. Even if the character was unforgettable one thing I would like point out is that it would have been better if more light was shed on Flethcer personal life which would have made his character slightly more believable. After the acting, the terrific music and soundtrack absolutely sucked me into the jazz atmosphere.The track 'Whiplash' over which Flecther throws a chair at Miller for not reaching the perfection is mesmerizing. Whiplash has made me a fan of jazz music out of nowhere. The editing and cinematography is splendid which we can see that in the intense and energetic drumming sequences which will keep you glued to the screen. The final drumming sequence in the climax was so exhilarating, it gave me goosebumps. Director Damien Chazelle who wrote the script himself keeps the screenplay focused on the two main characters. The story is quite unpredictable and you can expect some twists here and there. I found it hard to believe when I read somewhere that the whole film was shot in 19 days. Nothing more to say. Excellent.To sum it up, Whiplash is one movie of 2014 not to be missed. 2014 has been really outstanding with films like 'Boyhood', 'Birdman', 'Nightcrawler', etc. and now another gem called 'Whiplash'. I am thankful for witnessing such quality film-making. Excellent performances with absorbing story and direction plus the jazz music on top of it made Whiplash a memorable experience which stayed with me for hours after finishing it. It is energetically inspiring and heartfelt. Don't miss it.RATING: [4.5/5]",8,1,3,20 February 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Strong performances,mind-bending layered screenplay and technically brilliant
","Honestly I really don't understand why I ended up liking Birdman so much. The story feels as much ignorant as the alternate title.To begin with I truly was not able to stick myself with plausibility of the events shown in the film. Although I was quite able to relate to it metaphorically but the ending left me pretty much hanging. The story has a multi-layered point of view and the writers have done splendid job working on small little details which many casual viewers miss. Birdman is a kind of movie where you will spot something new on multiple viewings that you might have missed earlier.The story revolves around Riggan (played masterfully by Micahel Keaton) who was once a famous superstar for playing superhero Birdman in blockbuster movies. Now past his middle age, Riggan seems to have lost his path in the film industry but his mind is not a phase to accept it. He is working on Broadway play which he himself is directing and writing apart from acting in it to showcase his talents. We get see his internal struggle countering with his alter-ego 'Birdman' who makes him feel he is still a superstar and shouldn't waste his time on Broadway plays. Also he is facing family problems with distances between him and his daughter Sam (Emma Stone) constantly increasing. Starring in his play is a hardcore actor Mike (Edward Norton) whose dedications have no limit while he is acting and two more actress Leasley(Naomi Watts) and Laura(Andrea Riseborough) who have relatively smaller role. The entire star-studded cast was absolutely brilliant to watch and each of their characters is given ample amount of depth.The cinematography is excellent and the entire film is edited to make it look like a one continuous shot (except once in the climax). The background score comprising mostly drums was also splendid. The multi-layered screenplay was very interesting and there were also many laugh-out-loud moments which was a really surprising considering the theme was more of dark comedy. I am not very clear about what rating to give right now, will have stronger opinion after re-watching it few times. Still with its stellar cast, weirdly intelligent script I must admit Birdman is one the finest films I have seen this year. RATING:[4.5/5]",9,1,6,13 February 2015
The Water Diviner," Heartfelt story of fatherhood
","The Water Diviner is a heartfelt story of a father searching for his sons who went missing during war. Joshua Connor (Russel Crowe) is an Australian farmer whom the title addresses being the one able to find water beneath any land surface. His three sons are speculated dead in the 1915's Battle of Gallipoli, Turkey but no bodies are located or facts are known. Connor decides to go to Turkey to find out fate of his sons as a promise to his wife who commits suicide losing all hope. After reaching Turkey he finds a nice lodge run by Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) in Constatinople. They slowly start getting to close to each and the romantic side of the story is quite predictable. Apart from that we have a Turkish Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan) who for reasons unknown tries to help Connor with his search. I felt the film was strong with the drama and emotions, also the depiction of intense war scenes made it more engaging. There were many back and forth shifts and flashbacks which may put you off but the screenplay doesn't lose its flow. Some of the flashbacks of Joshua with his sons were heartwarming. The camera work with the Turkish locale and music was simply beautiful! I just wished they didn't dwell that much into romance aspect or they could have made it more authentic. Anyways Olga Kurylenko looked nice. Narrative was straightforward and a few scenes here and there felt clichéd. Despite all that, Russel Crowe gives a master performance carrying the weight of the film on his shoulders all the way with his quest for his sons. The times when the script focused on that it was really good, the rest not so much. Overall, it was a good enough film based on war-drama and fatherhood.RATING: [3/5]",6,2,5,27 June 2015
Taken 2," A step down from first film, but not horrible
","Taken 2 is no where near the first film. Its filled with inconsistencies and silly clichéd situation which don't make any sense at all. Yet somehow, I felt it was an somewhat satisfactory experience thanks to the powerhouse Liam Neeson and some good action. The families of all the Albanian human-traffickers killed by Brian in first film are very angry and are now seeking revenge. This time they try to capture Brian along with his ex-wife Lenore and daughter Kim. But they are successful in capturing only Brian and Lenore. Kim escapes with guidance from her father over his secret cell-phone(which by the looked silly and unrealistic). Now its Kim's job to locate them and then along with her dad kill the bad guys! I liked the way Brian deduces his location with his skills and also didn't mind Kim given the role of savior. Even if on the whole the story maybe rehash of first one, its a bit dynamic in its approach. Liam Neeson is bad-ass as in the first film and action sequences are good again (except the car chases). He is enough reason to give the film some credits. It is still filled with insanely silly things such as Kim learning to drive a gear-shift car out of nowhere or when the bad guys not even torturing Brian or Lenore after kidnapping them. Great Revenge! There is not even person guarding Brian despite knowing the kind of skills he posses and thus he left alone to easily plan his escape. Cool! Taken 2 has its fill of stupidities, yet there were many things I liked. I liked the way they extended the father-daughter relationship and made Kim make up for her rather passive role in first film. The story may be predictably silly at times but I couldn't resist wanting to watch Neeson kick some ass. Taken 2 is an obvious step down from first film but considering kind of horrible sequels we are getting these days in the action genre, it is not so bad. And after watching the Taken 3 recently, Taken 2 feels like an excellent film.RATING: [2.5/5]",5,1,1,3 July 2015
Mary and Max," Unique,sad and at times weird
","Mary and Max is a story of two lonely people residing miles away from each other and become unlikely friends through constant letter writing. The kids may not find this animated movie nice as there are dark and realistic portrayals of what we encounter in our lives. The movie is mostly black and white clay animation with slight shades of red. I haven't seen many stop-motion animated movies but the best I recall was 'Coraline' also released in 2009. Well as much as Coraline was filled with fantasy this one far realistic.The script is very good, giving us lessons we need to learn in life like moving on no matter what happens. The voice-actors also did fine job especially Philip Hoffman as Max. I liked the movie but it felt kind of repetitive after 1-2 conversations though the letters between Mary and Max. Also it tries to pity its characters a bit too much. What I did like is there were humorous moments popping up here and there despite the theme of the whole film being sad. If you don't like stop-motion animation or realistic films with not much excitement unlike what you see in your day to day animation films I suggest you keep away from this one.RATING: [3.5/5]",7,3,6,21 November 2014
Blade Runner," A beautiful and meaningful masterpiece.
","Blade Runner is not your day-to-day science-fiction movie filled with action sequences or aliens. Its a slow burning nightmarish depiction of what we may encounter in future on our path of technological advancement. Frankly speaking, I felt totally bored by its first half where nothing much happens. But the same was build up to the one best endings I have ever seen for any movie(talking about the final cut of the film).The message it tries to convey is very deep and philosophical which sometimes may not be understood in one viewing. The second time you see it, you are well aware of the pacing so you can indulge in the beauty of the film(more or less like viewing 2001: A Space Odyssey).Harrison Ford plays Deckard who is a Blade Runner. Blade Runner is a guy who hunts Replicants. Now Replicants which were clones created for working as slaves by a conglomerate called Tyrell Corporation. But later they are outlawed on Earth due to their tendency towards violence. Now some 4 replicants have made it to LA in pursuit of their creator and its Deckard's task to 'retire' them.Well the best thing about the movie is not its plot or story but the visuals. The dark and gloomy portrayal of the LA city is quite haunting. Makes you immediately think of our imminent future.The cinematography is top-notch. Also the questions it raise about humanity are golden, such as the meaning being a human , our resistance to our imminent death, can we be so technologically advanced that we can defy the laws of nature and so on.This is what pure sci-fi movies should be about generating thoughts and questions in our minds.The music by Vangelis adds remarkably to the haunting experience the film gives. Among the performances Harrison Ford does justice to his role of Blade Runner a character who slowly starts to understand what it is like to be replicant. The best performance is by Rutger Hauer playing Roy Batty the leader of the escaped replicants. A scene involving him and Deckard towards the end is one of the most heart-touching moments ever portrayed in movies.If you do not like the movie on your first view better suggest watch it again knowing what the movie is about and is trying to say. Also I would recommend the final cut of the film. Right now, this is my favorite science-fiction movie till date (yes, I prefer it more over the ambiguous and long 2001). If you are expecting some action- oriented sci-fi flick I suggest you stay away from this one.RATING:[5/5]",10,2,10,12 November 2014
Lucy," Interesting premise but flawed execution
","I never knew Lucy would turn out to be a nice superhero film. All I knew about it was that a woman Lucy breaks the barriers of human brain capacity reaching its maximum. Now the idea that having such a brain capacity will give you the ability perform telekinetic, mind control,control of electromagnetic waves and what not seems a bit too far fetched but it was fun and engaging to watch up to a level. I think that's how you might like the film, ignoring the science aspect of it.The movie begins with man tricking his girlfriend named 'Lucy' (Scarlett Johansson) into delivering a package to some drug-lord in Taiwan. Then it turns out it contains 4 packets a powerful drug called CPH4,one of which which then Lucy is forced to deliver by placing the packet in her belly along with 3 other people bearing the remaining 3 packets. The packet leaks when the buyer hits Lucy hard into her belly and the drug mixed into her blood gives her the ability and power the whole movie circles around. Well now intentions are to go after the drug lord and find the other 3 packets before they are misused. Once the search for the drug lord and drug sets in the action pumps up. We already have seen Scarlett in action as Black Widow of Avengers but here she shows the emotional depth of her character quite well too.Attaining such brain capacity and knowledge Lucy seems to be losing her humanistic ideals (which is again questionable) and she is having hard time digesting such power. Scarlett does it all with ease. Morgan Freeman is also there playing a professor expert in neurological science. He also adds some scientific and philosophical ideals into the film in the first half which was good to watch. Also some thought provoking questions about our existence of life, death,time,emotions and about being humans are raised which really boosted it in sci-fi department. But all this falls apart with an over the top climax going far beyond its reach. Also many of the action sequences become illogical due to Lucy's powers itself. She can hack into any system in the world yet the bad guys reach the destination earlier than her, you know just ensure there is final face-off.Actually Lucy gets a chance to kill the drug-lord for good early in the film but he is just kept injured so that he meets our heroine again at the end. Also it goes into full on '2001:Space Odyssey' mode at the ending which is supposed to wow us but up to the point things had become quite silly to accept any seriousness in the story despite the good visual effects and CGI.There some points in the film where it is better to keep doors of your brain shut and not think too much about what is going, it will help to enjoy this one more. Lucy is weak on story and script, also tries to reach the stars beyond its capacity yet despite its absurdness Lucy is somewhat an enjoyable ride and watchable action flick. Main credit goes to Scarlett who carries the weight of the film with a fine performance.RATING:[2.5/5]",5,1,5,1 December 2014
Unbroken," Emotionally inspiring but misses the mark
","Unbroken is an inspiring biopic of Olympic runner Louis Zamperini whose wartime experience during WWII is a story worth telling. Technically the film was strong with solid cinematography and seamless use of CGI. The same is not true with the screenplay though. It fails to provide enough character depth and development so that we could completely feel their motivation. We get to see the different events in Zamperini's life but they felt discontinuous and the swapping between his childhood life didn't work well. Also it needed better and more season actors. I am not saying Jack O'Connell or Domhnall Gleeson were not good, but they lacked the impact. There were still many good things in the film, the starting aerial sequence was amazing, the survival at ocean was good but bit too dragged and same can said about the Japanese prison camp. That is the problem, the film simply drags on with its torture at the prison rather. The ending part of the story which is displayed in credits was much more interesting and deserved screen time. The soundtrack was elevating and camera work was great. Unbroken gave me mixed feelings, but I would suggest to watch it solely for unbroken Louis Zamperini. His story is truly inspirational. If you can take it, you can make it.RATING: [2.5/5]",5,0,1,2 July 2015
Sin City," Brutally violent, not to be taken seriously.
","Based on the famous comic book series with the same name (which I haven't heard of till I saw the film), Sin City is a brutally violent film set in the overly fictitious Basin City. One must not even remotely try to compare it with reality and just take it as comic book entertainment where unimaginable things can happen. The narrative consists of 4 short story-lines linked together in a particular sequence, similar to Pulp Fiction. Yet, it fails to achieve the same level of excellence with clichéd script and overly stylized action. I saw the directors extended cut where each of the 4 stories are completely separated, you can go for it if you can handle the long credits after each story (which was ridiculous). The first story 'That Yellow Bastard' follows the story of Hartigan (Bruce Willis), an honest cop who is in danger after facing off with the corrupt senators son. The second 'The Customer is always right' wont make any sense till you see the entire film. The third 'A Hard Goodbye' follows Marv (Mickey Rourke), a bad-ass hunk who is almost impossible to kill. He plans to get rid of a even more horrific cannibal-killer Kevin (Elijah Wood). The last one, 'The Big Fat Kill', follows Dwight (Clive Owen) who has to handle a delicate situation between cops and the kick-ass girls of Old Town. The ones with Bruce Willis and Mickey Rourke were the best. Acting wise the cast is fabulous and has the commendable job. There are lots of things you need to link in order to get a proper linked story out of the 4 stories and the sequel (A dame to kill for). I would recommend forget it and just enjoy each story individually as in the end all of it wont make preach you anything. Everything is to be perceived only as entertainment nothing else. The level of violence is extreme. Each character feels like a nihilist. A persons head is smashed to pulp with bare hands, a mans hands and legs are cut and is fed to wolf alive. If you can handle such violence well and good, else don't bother to watch. The visual style of black & white with color to highlight works well with the neo-noir theme of the film. The dialogues feel a bit too cheesy at times and action sequences unrealistic. Anyways its just a comic book adaptation. Just enjoy it like that.RATING: [3.5/5]",7,0,1,19 May 2015
Moon," A Refreshing sci-fi experience.
","Moon may seem inspired by 2001: A Space Odyssey which is without any doubt the god of sci-fi films but this one explores its depths quite differently. In the future mankind is exhausted all its energy resources and energy requirements on earth are fulfilled by synthesizing helium-3 from moon soil. Astronaut Sam Bell works for Lunar Industries and his job is to manage he activities of harvesting helium-3 and send the harvested mineral back to earth at the base named 'Sarang' on the lunar surface. It is explained he is serving a three year contract and currently is almost at the end of his contract. He is badly missing his wife and is mentally deteriorating by loneliness. Live communication with earth is also not possible due to a damaged satellite so he sees only recorded messages from his wife and the employers of lunar industries from earth. A midst all of this, he is accompanied by a computer(similar to HAL-9000 from space odyssey) named GERTY who helps him with the various tasks to be performed everyday and acts a like friendly companion on their base. Well this the base plot with which the film begins and introduces for about half an hour. But then just as there are few days left for the end of the contract we encounter a confusing twist in the film for which answer gets slowly revealed over the remaining length. Its suspenseful and also has great emotional as well as scientific depth which is a key ingredient for any sci-fi movie.A lot can be discussed about the film as it has pretty much understandable story making it not open for multiple interpretations. But revealing more of it here will destroy the feeling of awe when you watch it first time.Sam Rockwell as the lonely astronaut Sam Base is rock solid and carries the film on his shoulders efficiently. He is the only main character in the film having major screen-time, each of the rest of cast is there for hardly few minutes except GERTY voiced nicely by Kevin Spacey. Despite having a low budget the shots of the lunar landscape were very effective and the sets of the 'sarang' base also looked nice(again inspired by sci-fi epics like space odyssey and alien). There are no great special effects with lasers, blasts or alien creatures just plain simple story of a man on moon filled with deep sci-fi ideas making you think about what will happen if we encounter such situations in real life. This is how science-fiction is enjoyed the best and it is my favorite genre alongside fantasy. The script is tight and focused and doesn't hinder into unnecessary subplots. Duncan Jones and Nathan Parker flawlessly dwell into the depths of the story and debut director Duncan Jones completely absorbs us into the movie making you strongly root for the astronaut.The background score is quite nice giving the space feel as required. And even in its short run-time of about 90 minutes it explores a lot. The pace in the first half is bit low which may bore some who are not much into sci-fiction films.Apart from that I did not find a single moment where I got bored. Moon easily gets into my list of best sci- fi movies, it may be inspired but is original in its own way.Rating:[4.5/5]",9,0,3,27 September 2014
Happy Feet," A happy and beautiful tale
","'Happy Feet' won the Oscar for best animated feature back in 2006 over the much more popular 'Cars'. While both were equally good, but I do the feel the strong message and catchy music of 'Happy Feet' gave it slight advantage. 'Happy Feet' is the tale of a dancing penguin 'Mumble' who gets rejected by the society which considers singing as penguin-thing and dancing as something horrid. Mumble's singing is quite pathetic and thus decides to leave the society. Well the story line may follow the typical 'odd-different guy finds his true potential and becomes hero' path still the number of interesting characters and lively songs keep you hooked. The voice- cast is splendid with likes of Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, Robin Williams, etc. The screenplay later delivers a strong environmental message with the penguins not having any fish to eat due human interference. But I feel the film should have been about 10-15 minutes short as the pace tedious in the first 45 minutes.The animation is simply beautiful, watching thousands of penguins dance together in a wave was really a wow-moment. 'Happy Feet' finally with heart-warming story and beautiful animation is worth a shot!RATING: [3/5]",6,0,0,1 April 2015
