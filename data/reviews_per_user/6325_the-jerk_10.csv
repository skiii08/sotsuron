The Blair Witch Project," boring as hell
","This movie was a brilliant marketing gimmick. I give the gimmick a 10. I actually knew people who bought that it was based on a true story, that the footage was real. And for these people, the movie must have been terrifying. There's a difference between a real documentary and a fake one, and this looked almost like the real thing. But we forgive a real documentary for shoddy camera-work, boring dialogue, etc, because it's real. And if anything compelling had happened here, I would have forgiven this movie for those same faults too. But...A brilliant movie it was not. It was, in fact, a terrible movie. The filmmakers just tried too hard to make it look real. As a result, we do get some decent acting, but if you're looking for a real plot, look elsewhere. The story just rambles along at an extremely slow pace. We get mysteries throughout, and a few minor shudders, and there was a spookiness to the cinematography, but the way it was shot was just too claustrophobic to be compelling. As far as the story, it was basically a standard 'kids lost in the woods' movie with all the clichés attached. They lose the map! They're going around in circles! Ooh, there are scary things happening outside the tent while they're sleeping! And those weird twig things! By the end of the movie, we're hungry for some kind of explanation as to what is going on. We never get it. What we get is an extremely cryptic ending that is too esoteric to make sense. I thought the sequel was supposed to explain what was going on?!? The sequel just went in a completely different direction, and it didn't make any sense either! By the way, I thought this was supposed to be a trilogy. Where's the third movie? Like I said, the acting isn't bad, but it's not great either; they actually look like film students doing a bad student film. The dialogue is awful. The movie is boring. And it doesn't make any sense. I think a lot of people were lulled in by that cutting-edge marketing gimmick, and maybe ended up confusing the gimmick for the movie itself. That's the only explanation I can see for people liking this movie. In my opinion, it was a con, and should have been a bomb. Instead, it was one of the most successful independent movies of all time, and because no real care went into the making, possibly the most profitable. I'm not going to down you if you liked this movie; I felt like I wasted my time watching it, and would have actually been angry if I had paid to see it in the theater.",1,3,6,13 April 2005
The Ring," scariest movie in years
","I don't scare easily. Usually, movies that are supposed to be scary just roll off my back. That's not to say that I don't love a good horror film; I'm susceptible to a few shudders in a good horror movie, but generally I can watch one and be able to sleep at night afterward.Not so 'The Ring'. This movie scared the s*** out of me. I can't put it any less crudely than that; something about it just resonated with me more than with other horror movies. 'The Ring' was the scariest movie I've seen in a very long time; not even classics like 'Halloween' or 'Psycho' approach this level of terror.I confess I've never seen the original Japanese film on which that was based, so I'm not in a position to compare the two; and I feel that it would be unfair to do so anyway. 'The Ring' stands alone as a great movie just as a movie based on a book can stand alone as a great movie, and that's what's important. The cast is top-notch; Naomi Watts, as Rachel, gives the best performance I've ever seen her give. It's a career-defining moment. Brian Cox also stands out as the long-suffering father of the little girl, Samara, who as played by Daveigh Chase may be the most chilling movie villain of all time. That she could do such a terrible thing and feel no remorse at all, being a little girl, it's just scary because it's so unexpected. The climax, where we see her crawl out of the TV to kill Noah (Martin Henderson, who along with David Dorfman as Rachel's son Aidan is credible and believable in his role) is just the scariest thing I think I've ever seen. I remember when I was little, watching 'Carrie', with this girl moving things with her mind, trapping all these people in a gym and killing them with an unholy bloodbath, being scared by that. I was not as scared by that when I was 10 as I was by the climax of 'The Ring' at 27. I still get chills thinking of that scene, and that little girl.The idea of being killed 7 days after watching a videotape didn't seem that scary to me, and I confess that when it was in theaters I had written it off as just another dumb teen horror movie along the lines of 'Urban Legends' or 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. Obviously I was way off, and I'm glad I gave into all the people who told me I had to watch it. I'm not sure if I can actually say that 'The Ring' is the scariest movie of all time, but it's definitely close.",10,0,1,14 April 2005
Scary Movie 2," Awesome opening, decent movie
","The second movie in the 'Scary Movie' series is, in my opinion, the weakest overall. That doesn't mean that it isn't without its merits, but the whole thing seems kind of like it was slapped together over a weekend. Many of the jokes just don't work, but there are enough side-splittingly funny bits to make it all worthwhile.This movie opens with an absolutely brilliant parody of 'The Exorcist'. It starts with the singalong scene with Andy Richter as Father Harris behind the piano. 'You guys know this one?' he asks, and then proceeds to play the opening bars of -- get ready -- 'Shake Ya Ass'. Megan Voorhees (played by Natasha Lyonne) comes down the stairs and starts peeing on the floor, interrupting the singalong. Her mother treats her like a dog! This segues into the more obvious parody of the movie with Father McFeeley (James Woods) coming in to perform the exorcism with Father Harris ('F--- this!' McFeeley says when he first encounters the possessed girl). It's classic.Then the movie kind of dries up. The basic story is a parody of 'The Haunting', a movie that was so bad that parody seems kind of unnecessary. It centers around a bunch of college kids going on an overnight trip to Hill House, ostensibly to study their sleep disorders but actually so the professor (Tim Curry) can summon the ghosts in the house. The only real connection with the first is found here, as some of the kids were picked because of their prior traumatic experiences (which they encountered in the first movie).Honestly, I thought the whole thing kind of rambled when I first saw it, and there were some eye-rollingly dumb jokes. But there were also a lot of very funny jokes and the cast (including Anna Faris, Shawn and Marlon Wayans, and the incredible Regina Hall from the original, mixed with vets Chris Elliot, David Cross, and Curry, Woods, and Richter) was very good; it was the writing that suffered more than anything. That, and the sloppy production values, but I guess that's nitpicking with a movie like this. Also, I didn't think the ending was very satisfying. Still, Brenda (Hall) and Cindy (Faris) messing with the 'scary' skeleton that tries to terrorize them ('This is a skeleton -- this is bones! Would you run from Calista Flockhart?' Brenda chides Cindy when they run into each other); Hanson (Elliot) and Dwight (Cross) arguing; and Cindy fighting a cat 'Raging Bull'-style were just some of the few very funny moments found in this movie.This may not seem like a glowing review, but I actually did like this movie and recommend it if you're into the spoof genre. Just don't expect 'Airplane!' or even the first 'Scary Movie' when you see it. On the bright side, it ain't 'Spy Hard' either.",7,0,2,18 August 2006
Full Metal Jacket," Split personality
","I know I'm in the minority here, but for me, 'Full Metal Jacket' was a disappointment. I guess the biggest problem I have is that it's split into two completely different movies: the first half, with R. Lee. Ermey (who's incredible in this) as a drill sergeant at boot camp imposing his will on the young cadets, particularly poor Vincent D'Onofrio, who ends up going insane because of the abuse he has to put up with. It's a chilling and sometimes even funny 45 minutes (or so) of film, and the ending is shocking and pure. I loved this opening.But after that, with Matthew Modine going out to war, is when it starts getting disappointing for me. There were some good bits (like the encounter with the Vietnamese prostitute, a scene that is justifiably famous) but on the whole, I felt left out in the cold. The tone changes completely for the switch from basic training to actual fighting, and while I'd never second-guess a master like Stanley Kubrick, it just didn't do anything for me. Even the ending with the big battle and jumpy camera-work was a bit cloying to me... it was supposed to be gritty and shocking, but instead, I actually found myself bored and wishing the movie would just end. For me, 'Full Metal Jacket' will always be two movies, with the first getting a 10, and the second getting a 5 at best. I definitely think it's worth watching, especially since the movie has so many fans, but in my opinion, Kubrick could have done better.",7,0,1,9 June 2005
Top Secret!," an overlooked gem
","Maybe some people just don't get it. This was made by the team of Zucker-Abraham-Zucker, responsible for 'Airplane', 'The Kentucky Fried Movie', and the 'Naked Gun' series, so who cares if it doesn't accurately reflect society? It's not meant to be a satire, folks, it's a very broad parody! I recently watched this again, and I caught something I had never caught before. In the dinner scene at the 'Hotel Gay Schluffen', Nick Rivers (played by Val Kilmer, and this may be the best thing he's ever done), American rock star, is told that he needs a jacket to eat in the dining room, but the restaurant will provide one. In the next scene we can see him in the background having a jacket tailor-made! The reason it's hard to catch is that there's exposition going on in the foreground (a ZAZ trademark). It's funny, but the amazing thing is that I've seen this movie many times over a period of something like 20 years, and I'd never noticed that before.I believe that this is one of the marks of a great spoof, that you can watch it many times and still pick up jokes you've never noticed before. Like ZAZ's other masterworks, this one is packed with hilarious one-liners and sight gags. Watch for the scene in the Swedish bookshop that's filmed backwards, the way the verses to the East German National Anthem keep getting longer and longer when translated into English, and the scene where an unfortunate agent is crushed inside a car (and what happens with him afterwards!). And this doesn't even scratch the surface. If 'Top Secret!' isn't ZAZ's funniest movie it's only because it has such strong competition. The men were comedic geniuses when they were together.Val Kilmer was hilarious as Nick Rivers, and the movie has a strong supporting cast, including Lucy Gutteridge as Nick's love interest Hillary (I wonder how Ms. Clinton would feel if she knew her name means 'She whose bosoms defy gravity'?), Christopher Villiers as Nigel, her ex-boyfriend (they spent some time stranded on a deserted island together), and Jeremy Kemp as the evil General Streck. Also look out for Peter Cushing, Omar Sharif, and Ian McNiece (hilarious as a spy whose cover is selling souvenirs, novelties, and party tricks). And watch out for the French resistance (who knows what they're doing in East Germany?), each one of whose names is a pun on a French word or phrase (Chocolate Mousse, Deja Vu, etc.)The plot? Does it matter? Something about the East Germans planning to take over the world while everybody's paying attention to an international cultural show they're putting on (Nick is the American representative), and the spies who are trying to stop it. But that's not the point, the point is the comedy, and I could go on and on about the many hilarious jokes but I'm not going to; let me just say without ruining anything that the funniest scenes in the movie involve a cow.It's usually overlooked, curiously enough, when talking about the great comedies, but there's no doubt about it, 'Top Secret!' IS one of the great comedies of our time.",10,163,185,11 April 2005
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," A GREAT movie for kids and adults alike.
","Who says that a movie can't be dark and still be for kids? Sure, the original may have sugar-coated things a bit more, but it was still just as dark and disturbing as this one was! And that's OK. Has anybody heard of the Brothers Grimm? They wrote fairy tales that were still ten times as dark as this movie, and they were for kids, and many of us read them when we were kids. Kids are savvier than we give them credit for, and honestly, I think that adults would be more put off by the disturbing imagery in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' than kids would. I saw this movie at a Friday afternoon matinée in a theater that was FULL of kids, and the reaction seemed pretty positive to me. (And as far as some of the 'hidden' risqué jokes, I remember the same types of jokes in a lot of Disney movies from the late 80s and early 90s; it's a part of the kid's movie landscape now.) I thought it was an excellent movie, for adults or for kids. I also thought it had some touches that actually improved on the original; the set pieces were amazing, and there was more with the great glass elevator (like the book) than in the original movie, which I was pleased to see.I thought I'd go into this being bored until they got to the factory because that was how I felt about the original, but even the opening scenes with the Bucket family, and Grandpa Bucket's flashbacks to his time working at the factory, are wonderfully entertaining. The unusual imagery starts there, with the gigantic factory 'ten times as big as any other chocolate factory', and Charlie's weird, funhouse-like shack and eccentric but loving family. I was most impressed with David Kelly as Grandpa Bucket, whose performance was all child-like wonder, and Helena Bonham-Carter and Noah Taylor were also good as Charlie's parents; and Freddie Highmore, who played Charlie, ought to have a decent career in front of him.Once they do get to the factory, though, things really take off. Johnny Depp puts in an excellent performance as Willy Wonka, not an impression of Gene Wilder AT ALL, but as usual, making the character his own. Without a doubt, he's the best thing about the movie, but the imagery is amazing too. It's exactly what you'd expect from a Tim Burton-made adaptation of the book; his trademark is all over everything, and the result is stunning. And the kids are great too, as are Deep Roy as every one of the Oompa Loompas, Missi Pyle as Violet's mother, David Kelly as Grandpa Bucket, and James Fox as Veruca Salt's father. From the start of the tour, the movie starts feeling like an acid trip, and the movie never lets go of that atmosphere. The result is amazing.The only slow parts, I think, are those dealing with Wonka's childhood (although Christopher Lee is good as his father, I just thought they were a little boring and wanted to get back to the factory when they were on) and the Oompa Loompas' musical numbers, which I didn't think had the charm of those in the original (actually, I thought the musical number with the puppets at the beginning of the tour was the best one in the movie). The ending is also just a bit overlong, but the whole package is so good that the pluses definitely outweigh the minuses. You'll enjoy this movie, especially if you're already a fan of Tim Burton's work, but also, I think, if you're a fan of the original movie or the book; however, even kids who have never been exposed to any of this will be entertained. It's often hilarious, always a visual treat, and has something to offer for everybody.",9,24,45,18 July 2005
There's Something About Mary," They ALL know.
","'There's Something About Mary' was the movie that broke the Farrelly Brothers, when they went from doing merely stupid gross-out movies (not that there's anything wrong with that) to intelligent, well-written gross-out movies. It was also a huge blockbuster that helped cement the careers of its two leads. It stars Ben Stiller as the everyman who's in love with Cameron Diaz as Mary, the perfect woman.Mary represents that girl that every guy wishes he was with. The title song sung by Jonathan Richman (playing a part that recalls Stubby Kaye and Nat King Cole from 'Cat Ballou') says that 'there's something about Mary that they don't know', implying that there's something about this girl that one guy sees but nobody else does; of course we realize by the end that that's not true, that EVERYBODY knows, whether they realize what it is about her that they are so in love with or not. Cameron Diaz plays the part perfectly. She's this perfect fox with a great personality and sunny disposition that it's easy to see any guy falling in love with.Ben Stiller is Ted, who had an opportunity to be with Mary in high school, but screwed it up by getting his genitals stuck in his zipper in her bathroom on prom night. It's a mistake that he curses for the rest of his life, so he hires Pat Healy (played to snake-oil perfection by Matt Dillon; he was really at his best here) to go to Florida where she lives and spy on her. But Healy falls in love with her too. We find that this is an endlessly repeating theme; guys just fall in love with Mary. So Healy cons Mary into thinking he's the perfect man, while telling Ted that she's a cow who's not even worth looking up. But there's more competition waiting in the wings, including an old boyfriend named Brett.Matt Dillon is at his best here. Ben Stiller is funny too, showing a real talent playing an average guy who keeps having bad luck dumped on him; it's similar to the type of part he would play later in 'Meet the Parents'. When Ted finds out that Healy was lying, he goes down to Florida to seek out Mary. But on the way he's arrested for soliciting gay sex at a rest stop, and subsequently charged with the murder committed by the hitchhiker he picked up (played by Harland Williams from 'Half-Baked'), who carries the body in a large canvas bag into Ted's car, and has dreams of striking it rich by releasing a video called '7-Minute Abs', meant to take business away from the '8-Minute Abs' people. Bad break piles on top of bad break, and you can't help but feel sorry for the guy, even as you're laughing at the outlandish and terrible things that are happening to him.This movie is a riot from start to finish. The whole cast is superb, including the smaller supporting roles (including Markie Post and Keith David as Mary's parents, Lin Shaye as Magda (she also played a supremely disgusting woman in 'Kingpin'), Khandi Alexander from 'Newsradio' and Sarah Silverman from 'Mr. Show' and 'Saturday Night Live' as Mary's friends, Chris Elliot as Ted's buddy Dom/Mary's old boyfriend Woogie, Lee Evans as Tucker/Norm, another con artist out to get Mary, and Willie Garson as one of Ted's old high school friends). And the dog is hilarious too; he actually gets two of the most memorable scenes in the movie. In the end, despite all the competition, despite the appearance (orchestrated by Ted himself, because he just wants Mary to be happy) of Brett Favre, and despite the fact that he was basically stalking her, it's Ted who gets Mary. So every man wants the perfect woman, but it's the everyman himself who gets her. It's a great ending to a great movie, almost sappy but funny enough to get away with it, much like the rest of the movie.",10,0,1,9 June 2005
Groundhog Day," Incredibly deep and also hilarious
","'Groundhog Day' is another example of a movie that deserved multiple nominations (and wins) at the Academy Awards. At the time, it was often dismissed as a light fantasy-comedy. But actually Danny Rubin and Harold Ramis wrote an incredibly intelligent, heartwarming, and funny script, and Bill Murray put in the performance of his lifetime.Phil Connors, played by Murray, is having a bad day. A nearly infinite amount of times. I don't believe the story that the movie takes place over 10 years of reliving the same day; it's clearly implied that it's A LOT more than that, and that's what the screenwriter originally had intended anyway. And this is where the brilliance of both the script and Murray's performance lies; we're not watching the same thing over and over again, because we have as a focal point Phil, who's reliving the day and reacting to it differently each time. The stages he goes through until he finally learns to accept it and try to make something of it are interesting. By the end of the movie he's reached something akin to nirvana, where every move he makes is perfect, and thus he's finally allowed to move on.We never get an explanation of why this is happening, which only heightens our fascination of it. It seems implied by the ending that something divine is going on; Phil really seems to reach perfection, a state of being, perhaps, a perfect human being, or as close to it as we can get, and that's where the timescale becomes apparent; think how long it would take to achieve such a thing! And all this is masked at first appearance by all the humor going on. At first glance, it really appears to be a screwball comedy (and even as such, it's laugh-out-loud funny), and you can't see the brilliance behind everything. It's a nearly perfect movie, and it's one of my favorites.",10,14,20,13 June 2005
Total Recall," Who am I?
","Before this movie, Arnold Schwarzenegger had shown his impressive acting abilities by playing a killer cyborg, a barbarian, a commando, a marine, and Hercules. In 'Total Recall', he actually plays a character that goes against type: he's a regular guy, albeit one with the physique of a Mr. Universe, who is thrust into extraordinary circumstances.Or is he? That's the central question of 'Total Recall', and we're left wondering throughout the movie what Ah-nold's real identity is (I won't spoil any surprises here). It's a fantastic sci-fi set-up, especially when you throw the main setting of Mars into the mix.The plot: Arnold Schwarzenegger plays Douglas Quaid, a construction worker in the year 2084 who's been having weird dreams about living on Mars. There's a mystery woman in his dreams, a brunette, who sparks jealousy in his wife (played by Sharon Stone, who's also pretty good in this; it's one of the earliest things I remember seeing her in). Quaid sees an ad for a place called Rekall, which implants vacations in people's memories that are as good as the real thing. So he goes to Rekall, gets a memory-vacation package for Mars where he plays the part of a spy and that includes the woman in his dreams, and that's when things go haywire.This is where the central mystery of who Schwarzenegger really is starts. All of a sudden, he's thrust into a complex story of some rebels on Mars trying to overcome their ruthless dictator Cohaagen, and he's a central part of the story. Here's where it gets twisty: it comes into question whether he's actually Douglas Quaid or this spy named Hauser who's involved in the whole thing! All of a sudden, his wife and friends turn against him, he's on the run from Cohaagen's lieutenant Richter (played by Michael Ironside) and (on the advice of himself, as Hauser) he must make his way to Mars, where he gets embroiled in a plot to help the rebels, mostly a bunch of mutants. They are led by Kuato, a psychic mutant coming out of the abdomen of a fellow named George (Marshall Bell). And his dream girl also comes into the picture in the person of Melina (Rachel Ticotin, who's fabulous), who's also trying to help the rebels. Always on your mind as you're watching this movie is the question: What's real, and what's merely a mind-implant? Is the whole movie from the point he visited Rekall a dream, or was the life he knew the dream? And also coming into the play is the question of whose side Hauser is actually supposed to be on, and what this reactor built by the original Martians a million years ago is supposed to do, exactly...Based on the story 'We Can Remember It For You Wholesale' by the great Philip K. Dick (who also wrote the story 'Blade Runner' was based on), and directed by Paul Verhoeven ('Robocop'), 'Total Recall' is consistently thrilling and amazing, with some incredible visuals, including the barren surface of the planet Mars, and the station where the residents of Mars are housed. Of course, it's a great action movie. There's also a lot of great humor (including a mutant hooker with three breasts), terrific special effects, and constant plot twists throughout (unlike many other Schwarzenneger films, this one makes you think). This movie is easily one of the best Schwarzenegger has ever done (he actually puts in a decent acting job, probably his best ever), and also one of the best sci-fi thrillers ever made. The ending, though it stretches credibility, is a brilliant, old-time sci-fi ending.",10,1,3,28 September 2005
The Sixth Sense," actually 3 different movies
","'The Sixth Sense' is a creepy, atmospheric puzzler about a child psychologist who is trying to help a depressed little boy come to grips with the fact that he sees ghosts. There's more than meets the eye, as everybody knows by now, and the first time you see it, if you don't know the surprise, it's an excellent movie.Like I said, everybody knows the secret by now, it's like the sled in 'Citizen Kane' or the penis in 'The Crying Game', so it doesn't even feel necessary to warn that there's a spoiler herein. Bruce Willis is dead! Now, if you were one of the people who found this out before seeing the movie, I bet it ruined it a little for you. And this is the problem with this movie; knowing the surprise spoils it a little bit, and since the surprise is nothing more than a gimmick (albeit a well-done gimmick), I think this movie relies a little bit too much on the gimmick to be considered a great movie.I didn't know the first time I saw it, by the way, and I was blown away. In 1999, it was one of the best movies of 1999. Make no mistake. It wasn't until it was released on DVD that things started to go downhill.Let me explain. I said at the top that this is actually 3 different movies, and it is; it's like a chameleon.1)You're seeing it for the first time, and you don't know how it comes out. Excellent. The surprise is terrific; I figured it out, but not until about 5 minutes before it was revealed anyway, and I know there are definitely people who didn't figure it out, even though they were trying to figure out something. The first time, you really appreciate the performances by Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Ozment, and Toni Collette. They all do outstanding jobs, and this is the one aspect of the movie that really does hold up over time. 10/10.2) You're seeing it for the second time. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you appreciate the work that went into concealing this fact, paying attention for some little slip-up and not finding it. But really, let's be honest; on the second viewing, and probably to an extent on any subsequent viewings, you're giving your full attention to the execution of the gimmick. And it's still good, there's a lot to appreciate here. 9/10.3) You're seeing it for the third time, and any time after that. You know that Bruce Willis is dead, and you know how artistically this was hidden throughout. So what's left? Well, the fine performances, and the creepy atmospherics, and the entertaining story. So let's not penalize the movie too much at this point, but over time, the quality definitely does wear down, because to some extent, you're still constantly thinking about that gimmick. 7/10, the rating I gave above.And really, there's a fourth aspect to all this; you're seeing it for the first time, and some dip**** spoiled it for you. Well, you may actually be in a pretty good position. You know Bruce Willis is dead, so on the one hand, you're not pulled in so much by the gimmick, and you can appreciate the other aspects that made this movie good; on the other hand, the surprise is lost on you. You see, it's a completely different movie if you knew the gimmick the first time, and you will never see it the same way as others did. That's a shame, but at least you weren't trying all along to 'figure it out', and thus, the performances by Willis, Osment, and Collette may seem all the brighter. I can't comment on how viewers would have rated the movie in this position, because I wasn't one of them. But I think they would have liked it.So there you have it. AT LEAST 3 different movies, and at least 3 different ratings. I do give it points for being able to change so much on repeated viewings, but I have to take away some, because the power the movie has over you is influenced so much by that gimmick. It's not that it has become a bad movie over the years, but it has lost its status as a great movie.",7,0,1,5 May 2005
