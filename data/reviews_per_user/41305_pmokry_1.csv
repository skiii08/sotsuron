Resident Evil: Afterlife," Terrific!
","This title is perfect waste of time. No value. Same as all Resident Evil movies, so you don't have to think as you watch. Beautiful piece!I really tried to find some bad moments, but there's ONLY 'great' portion of ART. A lot of irrational conversations, so you're brain won't have to wake up. Copycat scenes you've seen thousands of times. That's what every one loves, isn't it?Model-like actors beautiful in every scene either they fight or not. Milla is so sexy. I think there isn't more sexier actor than her in action movies.High-tech locations over the top. Slow-motion scenes are their BEST.",1,1,4,17 May 2014
