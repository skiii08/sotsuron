Captain Phillips," One heck of a boat ride
","DIRECTION Love him or hate him, this is arguably Paul Greengrass' best movie to date. As with all of his movies, you need to get ready to be up close and personal. Greengrass loves having the camera right up in people's faces but it puts you right into the middle of the action and increases the intensity that this movie brings. And let me tell you, it is intense. It's not long before the drama starts to unfold and you get the feeling of 'uh oh'. How Greengrass gets amazing performances out of unknown actors, and even military personnel who didn't know they were going to be in a movie, is beyond me. And it's some of the little things that add up as well. For example, the gun marks left of Tom Hanks' head after a gun was pressed up against it, just so you know the danger is real. The use of the military was amazing, and while it's not too in-depth, it's incredible what they had to do to execute this rescue. Greengrass perhaps took some liberties with some things, but the way he tells this story is incredible and extremely effective.Grade: A+SCRIPT The story here, like Gravity, is pretty simple on the surface. Four Somali pirates invade a cargo ship, kidnap it's Captain and try to get back home to negotiate for a lot of money. However, this story is much more complex than that. Outside of the political game that was played off-screen, it's the relationship dynamics between the pirates and Captain Phillips that bring depth to the story. We learn that these pirates are not working for themselves, but for a Somali gang Lord who is using them to get money and goods for the tribes. And it's the pressure from these gang leaders that pushes these pirates to the brink which ended up being a huge disaster. The U.S. Navy gets involved and they begin a rescue operation, which ends up being one of the more incredible stories you'll ever see. As for Captain Phillips, he's calm at the beginning and is confident when the U.S. Navy shows up. He makes some questionable decisions that really puts his life in danger but at the same time you know he just really wants to get out of there. The dialogue for this script is awesome, believable and ironic at time. Everything flows together seamlessly and it gets intense. You may or may not end up caring for any of these pirates, but in the end it's all about Captain Phillips and the amazing rescue that ensues.Grade: APERFORMANCES This is Tom Hanks best performance in a decade. He's absolutely incredible as Captain Phillips. He has the accent down, all the mannerisms and brings an emotional depth I haven't seen from him in awhile. The scene he has at the end is a reminder why he's an Oscar winner and a beloved actor. While the story from the military side is incredible, this is the Tom Hanks show and he brings it on screen. As for Barkhad Abdi, a first-time actor, let's just say if he is nominated for supporting roles, I won't be surprised. For never acting before, him and his Somali friends are amazing and steal the show in their own right. They have a lot of screen time, some back story, and even put them in a light where you may like them on some level. And it's not just the character writing. The performances make these characters a little likable, a little hatable and bring them to life. There is depth to these performances and for actors who've never done this before, they are almost flawless. When you combine that with Tom Hanks, get ready for an amazing boat ride thriller. Also just to note, Greengrass used real military personnel that didn't know they were going to be in a movie, but you can hardly tell. Just wanted to throw that out there. Grade: A+SCORE The score here was done by Henry Jackman. Need I say more? Jackman is the Peyton Manning of movie composers. Or maybe that's Hans Zimmer? If not Manning, he's the Aaron Rogers of movie composers. He's always reliable and is incredible with anything he puts his hands too and he doesn't disappoint here. While not the most memorable of scores by Jackman, it brings an amazing intensity that the movie needed and has some great musical elements. I love Jackman's use of drums in the action elements to really bring it when needed. There's some African vibes to some tracks and it's the type of score that is perfect for this movie.Grade: AFINAL THOUGHTS Captain Phillips is one of the most amazing films of the year so far and is driven by incredible performances from Tom Hanks and Barkhad Abdi. The story, while maybe not 100% accurate, is still amazing, intense and one that you'll love to see. The military rescue is unbelievable and the execution is almost hard to believe. It's like this story played out in a way that was meant to be a movie script. And the movie was very good.Overall Grade: A+",10,4,8,14 October 2013
Gravity," Movie Review: Gravity is an excellent 3D thrill ride
","DIRECTION The first thing to know about Alfonso Cuarón's Gravity, is that it's not just a visual spectacle, but it's an interesting character piece as well. However, it's the visual style here that places this movie among some of the best we've ever seen. It's the best 3D movie since Avatar and you can tell he's been working on this for years. Many shots specifically rely on the 3D effect to give you the trill ride Cuarón is looking for and it's incredibly effective. The aesthetic is the best I've ever seen for a space movie and is one of the more realistic one's you'll encounter to date. You really feel like you're in space floating around and experiencing something you never have before. The camera almost operates as it's floating around too. It circles often, turns in various ways and it very specific to show you depth and the different ranges of space. The visuals of earth and the sun are absolutely gorgeous and breathtaking. This is easily the best visual effects in quite some time and easily the best of 2013. Buckle up and enjoy the ride.Grade: A+SCRIPT The story is pretty simple on the surface. Ryan Stone, Sandra Bullock, is a medical engineer and is teamed up with astronaut Matt Kowalski, George Clooney, who are working on a new project up in space in lower Earth orbit when disaster strikes. It's a simple survivor story right? Wrong. They both become adrift in space and now have to team up to survive and figure out how to get back home. Throughout the struggle, we find out that Stone has some bad heartache and is still learning to grieve and let go of her pain. Yet, Kowalski, is a fun-loving guy looking to break some space records but ultimately knows what to do in order to survive. Once you start digging beneath the surface, Gravity speaks to amazing concepts of struggle and the fight to survive. This is especially difficult when you don't have anything to live for, but when you find that reason, it's not about just getting by but living each moment like it's your last. Sure, some parts of the script rely on coincidences and luck, but those moments are forgivable and small in the big picture of things.Grade: A-PERFORMANCES Sandra Bullock can be hit or miss, depending on who you ask, but in Gravity, she's a homerun. Regardless of what you think about Bullock, she does drama well and as a character who is traumatized in life and now the situation she faces, Bullock shines. Her character has depth and she brings a lot of emotion to her which is incredibly effective. You fall for her character and the struggle that she's in, both as a person and the situation. To me, this is Sandra Bullock's best role she's ever done. George Clooney has less screen time than expected but is also very good. He's the jokster, fun-loving astronaut that has a lot of stories to tell. He's also smart and comes across very engaging. Clooney doesn't have as much to do but is really good for what his character calls for. And you have to love the Ed Harris cameo. He was amazing in Apollo 13 as the NASA commander and is back in Houston as the voice that communicates back to our struggling astronauts.Grade: A+SCORE This is by far Steven Price's best score. He was great in The World's End, but his score not only is effective here but it's a critical piece to the film. This movie calls for emotion and is a huge spectacle and Price's score reflects that beautifully. He uses a lot of strings mixed with digital music and even some voice work. It's a good listen outside of the film and is perfect for what this film needed.Grade: A+FINAL THOUGHTS Gravity is a movie you want to see in 3D. In fact, go to the biggest IMAX 3D screen you can find. The visuals are absolutely stunning and gives you the best 3D thrill ride you've seen in a long time. The performances shine and you feel like you're a part of the action in space. If you want to know what it's like in space without ever going there, watch this movie. It's absolutely incredible.Overall Grade: A+",10,7,14,4 October 2013
About Time," About Time is charming and hilarious
","DIRECTION There's not many times that I ridiculously disagree with critics (as a whole) because 60% on Rotten Tomatoes doesn't even come close to how awesome Richard Curtis' About Time really is. About Time is absolutely charming, very funny and explores the entire emotional spectrum really well. Curtis is very straight forward with his story but it's massively engaging and entertaining. One scene involves a band playing at a train station, playing a lovely romantic song as the main characters come back and forth as time keep passes by. Curtis' creative scenes like that stand out, create a fun environment and set the tone well. The actual time travel is uniquely done too and is used for great humor in many cases. Curtis' use of music is done extremely well too and is really appropriate for the different emotional tones we get. This is easily the best Rom-Com of 2013 and is one to see.Grade: A+SCRIPT The story is pretty straight forward for the most part but does have some complexity to it later on in the story. The story centers around Tim (Domhnall Gleeson) who discovers the men in his family can travel back in time. And as a youthful man, love is the big thing on his mind. He moves from the countryside of England to the city of London where he meets Mary (Rachel McAdams) and everything changes. Tim realizes that he can uses his time travel to re-do things without many negative consequences, which is really convenient. But throughout the story, we do find that there are some negative consequences if he's not careful with what he chooses as it does affect his future on some level. What makes this story brilliant, is that it's not very Hollywood. This is where many critics miss the point. It's too predictable that Tim would use time travel to do dumb things, mess up his life, bring in drama, but then fix everything at the end. That's what we need again, right? Wrong. In fact, Curtis sets up those moments really well but instead we get a guy who learns to have fun with his time travel but he's smart and knows exactly what he wants. It's the straight forwardness you wouldn't expect. Instead of it being filled with Hollywood drama, we get a story that's fun, extremely hilarious, and emotional all at the same time. And it's not just a love story. The love aspects blend so well with the father/son relationship story that is just riveting. This story is uniquely told by Curtis and ultimately it's not about the time travel but how one can miss the important details that life can wonderfully make.Grade: APERFORMANCES Easily one of the funnies performances of the year and wonderfully made for the actors to just have a lot of fun with what they are dong. Domhnall Gleeson is amazing as Tim. He's the shy, awkward young man who doesn't know exactly how to talk to women but knows that love is what he wants. He's really believable as the character and he shines. He especially shines in scenes with Bill Nighy who plays Tim's father. Gleeson and Nighy have some great chemistry and both bring some refreshing humor to the movie. Rachel McAdams is beautiful and while she doesn't have as much to do, she's great for the role she plays. There's one specific scene where she tries on about 20 different dresses that's just brilliant. Lydia Wilson who plays Kit Kat, Tim's younger sister, and she's really funny as the crazy sibling who brings life to the screen. All the rest of the supporting cast is great as well and only brings more humor and life to what this movie is trying to do. If you don't have fun with this cast and story (critics I'm talking to you), then you're really missing the point. Amazing.Grade: A+SCORE Nick Laird-Clowes doesn't have a ton on his resume but here Laird-Clowes has some really great melodies that play throughout the film. His main theme is absolutely gorgeous and we hear it many times that just elevates this movie even further. Add to that, an amazing soundtrack list that is full of some really great songs that accompany the film tremendously. The music is crucial in many parts of the film that either bring fun or an emotional element that is really great. Go seek out the music, it's really good.Grade: A+FINAL THOUGHTS About Time isn't a movie about time travel. While it's the main premise of the film, it's really a film about relationships. Yes, perhaps time travel let's them play out the way you want, but who wouldn't want that? And who wouldn't want to spend some more time with their father or people they love if they could? It's the type of story that is just a lot of fun, filled with laughter and is what we all hope for. If you want a drama-filled heart attack, go watch The Walking Dead. About Time is perfect for what it's trying to do.Overall Grade: A+",10,0,3,8 November 2013
Rush," Rush brings intense racing action
","DIRECTION Ron Howard is amazing. His camera work here is absolutely incredible. I wouldn't at all be surprised if the cinematography and the sound editing are nominated for Oscars. The engines roaring alongside Hans Zimmer's score really gets you into the mood. The backdrop is gritty with lots of dark and gray colors giving it a tough 1970′s aesthetic. Howard places is camera so specifically and we get so many different angles that are gripping. Camera work inside the cars giving you the intense look of driving an F1 car as well as camera's on the grass looking up as they fly by. Howard's use of slow motion is also perfect and helps build the intensity of the rivalry he is exploring here. The racing is intense and the dangers are shown in some dramatic ways as the suspense keeps building up. The biggest problem is that Formula 1 isn't the biggest of sports here in the U.S. If people can get past that and go see this, they won't regret it.Grade: ASCRIPT The story follows two F1 drivers in the mid 1970′s that don't always get a long but have a mutual respect for one another. It centers around British driver, James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda. Peter Morgan's script is brilliant and Howard brings it to life in some really great ways. In essence, both characters are the protagonist and the antagonist of the story. The film explores Hunt and his immature ways but at the same time makes him very likable. Then the story switches to Lauda and his quest to live his own life outside the big family business, yet again making him likable. However, at the same time each take their own turn in being the 'bad guy' and showing you qualities that make this person flawed and unlikable in some ways. But then the movie brings it back around showing you why these characters are good characters to root for and the mutual respect they have for one another. It's the competition that drives them in this story. What makes it so great though, is that the audience really gets to choose who they want to root for. They build up and tear down each character so flawlessly. The use of narration at the beginning and at the end was a perfect choice as well. The ending becomes a bit sentimental and hits the buttons that you'd expect from Howard and company.Grade: APERFORMANCES Daniel Brühl and Chris Hemsworth are amazing. This is perhaps Hemsworth's best as he portray's James Hunt in some incredible ways. He's the dangerous driver that has Tony Stark mentalities in terms of partying, women and being extremely likable. Yet Hemsworth shows some depth and some emotion here as well which this character calls for in some ways. Brühl, who you may know from Inglorious Basterds, almost steals the show. He's the Austrian car genius who becomes famous for knowing how to make the cars lighter and faster, thus making him part of the Ferrari team. One can argue he's the bigger lead here as he narrates a good chunk of the story and brings in some great perspectives. Brühl's performance is spot on though and brings life to this character even when Lauda is more deadpanned. Olivia Wilde is good here although her character is a small role. This is about Brühl and Hemsworth and they carry the movie extremely well.Grade: A+SCORE Freakin Hans Zimmer. The dude is on fire lately. A lot of people like to criticize Zimmer for having score's that are similar or nothing new but they work. His score for Man of Steel added a lot to that film and his score for The Lone Ranger was about the only good part of that movie. And his score for Rush was really great, again. It added a lot of intensity to the racing moments and has become something he's perfected. The score here is more laid back and in the backdrop though many moments but when the action ramped up, so did his score as well as your emotion.Grade: A-FINAL THOUGHTS Rush was an unexpected pleasant surprise. Given the sports stature of F1 in the U.S., I didn't have much expectations but Ron Howard usually delivers and he does once again. The cinematography is gorgeous and makes it visually very exciting. The performances are stand outs which makes the story feel so alive in many places.Overall Grade: A",10,69,93,1 October 2013
Thor: The Dark World," Thor: The Dark World is entertaining and fun
","DIRECTION Alan Taylor, mostly known for TV, gets the directors chair for Thor: The Dark World and brings us Thor in some new and fun ways. This version of Thor is much more complex and darker than the first time we met the God of Thunder. The visuals are just as amazing and the main characters get a little more interesting. The camera work is solid, especially when shooting the aerial combat scenes we get. There's also another great shot when we first see Loki and Thor together where Loki is being sarcastic and the camera work almost operates as another character. Not to mention, Taylor throws in some great cameos there. The pacing is very good and there's a great mixture of Thor in action and dialogue that sets up the story. Some of what Taylor is doing can come across off as confusing, especially to new fans but overall what Taylor does is entertaining and fun.Grade: A-SCRIPT The story pretty much picks up right after The Avengers as Thor is now back in his realm making sure that all the realms are at peace. We are introduced to a new alien race that is an old enemy of Asgard. Their secret weapon is eventually found by Jane Foster (Natalie Portman) and all the worlds collide (literally) as Thor and Odin try to find a way save Jane and destroy this secret weapon. At the same time, Loki is now in an Asgard prison because of his actions in The Avengers. However, after an attack on Asgard and a tragic incident, Thor must now rely on Loki to help him destroy the enemy. The conflicts created here are interesting and well explored. Much of the dialogue and scenes between Thor and Loki are very funny and well crafted, showing realistically what a brother-brother relationship looks like, but amongst Gods. The story is also very science-y and is heavy on the dialogue that is sometimes hard to keep up with. The main villain isn't that interesting and isn't explored enough to really care about much. Overall, it's still a fun story and the gripping relationship between Thor and Loki keep it engaging.Grade: B+PERFORMANCES Chris Hemsworth has become a defining character in the Marvel universe and hammers down this character well (see what I did there). He's fantastic as usual and brings a wittiness to the character we haven't see much of yet. His action shots, especially with the Hammer are really good. Portman on the other hand is more hit or miss. The character could be written better but for what she's doing she's okay. Portman really didn't want to reprise this role and it's easy to tell in some scenes but overall brings it when it mattered. Tom Hiddleston is unbelievable as Loki. And by unbelievable, I really mean it's hard to believe how believable he is as that character. He's got all the charm and evilness that makes this a fun character. Anthony Hopkins is also great as Odin. I thought he was fantastic in the first Thor movie and again, he's perfect as the Asgard King. The rest of the supporting cast, including the awesome Idris Elba, is very good even though they have little to do overall.Grade: A-SCORE This is perhaps the best Brian Tyler score yet. Tyler's scores in the past haven't been bad but they haven't been stand out worthy either. Patrick Doyle's score for the first Thor is really good and stands out on it's own very well. Tyler doesn't use the same themes here but the theme he does come out with is very good and brings a good element to the film. It's not too distracting but it's also fun to listen to inside and outside of the movie. Without giving anything away, I do want to mention there's an Alan Silvestri theme that plays out in a cameo appearance that's really awesome. The crossovers have even gone into the scores as well. I love it.Grade: AFINAL THOUGHTS Thor: The Dark World is a great continuation in the Marvel Universe and it's a better direction than Iron Man 3. It's entertaining and the relationship between Thor and Loki is great. It's a good step up from the first film and introduces some new characters. The average fan may have a hard time with this though and some elements are tough to care about but overall it's still very enjoyable. Also, if you see it in 3D, there's some awesome footage you'll see of Captain America: The Winter Soldier.Overall Grade: A-",8,1,5,8 November 2013
