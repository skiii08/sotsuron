Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," On IMDb this movie is rated as high as Kubrick? Are you people crazy?
","We have a winner! One of the worst movies made in a really long time. It takes a lot for me to leave in the middle of the movie but in this case leaving the theater was similar to leaving a really dirty restroom  you really glad when you can breathe air that has not sh1t flavor to it. I never knew that I have a low tolerance for bodily humor but jokes about sh1t or ur1ne provided entertainment for the audience every five minutes or so. Someone sh1ts in front of building in New York, someone sh1ts in the car, someone washes face in a toilet, someone ur1nates in river while other person washes face in it, someone gets a plastic bag with sh1t to a diner table and asks a host to wipe his behind. Countless jokes about child molestation, for example 'when I got my wife she had assho1e like 7 years old, but now she is 15 and she is not like she used to be'. After each scene with sh1t or child molestation or incest, movie provide justification such as main character hate Jews. By the middle of the movie I clearly understood that anti-Semitic people are extremely poor, sh1t everywhere, molest children, speak bad English, drink from a toilet, enjoy incest, encourage relatives to be prostitute, rape women and small animals. What I don't understand is why do I have watch all this. To hate immigrants? To hate anti-Semitic people? To laugh at poor? If poverty is so funny why don't you make great comedy about Africa? On IMDb this movie is rated as high as Kubrick. Are you people crazy?",1,26,58,4 November 2006
The Prestige," What can I say, wow!
","What can I say, wow! I almost missed this movie in theaters. I looked at number of reviews and got a sense that this movie is about obsessed magician revivals, and how important professional life to those who care. Yesterday, while rearranging my Netflix queue I noticed to my surprise that movie is one of 250 best rated movies. So after short research I found one theater where movie was still playing. Movie certainly was worth the effort. It is somewhat similar to 'Usual Suspects', but better since, I can much easily associate myself with magician then with criminal. I tracked at least three nested stories, it has absolutely unexpected ending, and movie is very logical if you analyze it afterward. Scarlett Johansson acting was average but other actors just took me there. I believed every word. If you can still catch it in a theater, go, and if not happy DVD viewing.",7,9,18,14 December 2006
The Da Vinci Code," This is not your typical Hollywood movie; fanatics in audience.
",The Da Vinci Code is a great movie and very close to the book. Acting is absolutely amazing  I believed every scene. Applause at the end of the movie was unexpected since several viewers were trying to deliberately ruin the movie by making snoring noises and loudly telling to each other how boring this movie is. So you can safely assume that you will see some fanatics that will try to spoil your movie experience. If you are not familiar with at least some of the historical facts discussed in the movie you will have a hard time following the logic of it. This is not your typical Hollywood movie and it is better then the book in many aspects. Book was trying to capture the audience by clever tricks and movie was trying to show unusual insight on human history.,8,0,3,21 May 2006
