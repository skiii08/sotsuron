Captain Phillips," Interesting movie
","We don't know so much about these activities oversea. It was interesting watch story about different point of view. Very interesting 'play' with camera, it involves about story. You feel on shoes of every character on screen. It was a good thriller. It's incredible things happened on our world these days.",9,1,3,29 April 2017
World War Z," A different movie about Zombies
","Almost all zombies' movies are focused in closed places: a town, a mall, a school, a neighborhood but in this movie we can imagine the problem at global scale: US, Korea, Europe. It is a movie with fast sequences, and focused in one man with an objective at mind: rescue his family.I would like that the film includes some of the most representative figures included in the book:a) Damages to the government structures around the world b) Problems at Pakistan c) Problems at Iran d) Chinese civil war But anyway i enjoyed the story, the locations and the end. About zombies it is a suggested movie. This time are not the US at charge of the world rescue it is the United Nations. I can't wait for the second part.",10,6,13,14 July 2013
Star Trek Into Darkness," Star Trek: Live long and prosper
","This weekend has been released in Mexico the next installment of STAR TREK: INTO DARKENESS. Therethrough we see that characters are not black or white, absolutely everyone has shades of gray and this film explores this.Very interesting the vision about our planet, specially about London.Among other interesting details of the plot consolidate friendship between Mr. Spock and Captain Kirk.At the end you are going to expect what more is on the future of the SS Enterprise...Recommended...",8,6,16,12 May 2013
Fast & Furious 6," Fast and Furious 6
","The cars are one of the basic elements for action movies nowadays and that's the reason for fast & furious's success. After Rio, Toretto's family: Dominic, O Conner, Mia are now at Europa, and Hobbs ask them for help because a Russian ex-military is planning traffic with a powerful weapon; one argue is convincing: Letty is alive. Spectacular sequences, big cars, London, and Spain Highways are the complement for this movie. When we think that the movie is ending, takes places a story change. One of the think that like me from the movie is that between lines they promote the value of the family, and one dialog from Toretto show this: 'Do not turn your back on your family even if they give it to you if'. A excellent sequence introduce a Jason Statham as a new villain for the next movie and explain how Han Lue dead.",8,5,7,26 May 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," A very good movie
","X Men was one of the first movies about comics during last decade.The cartoon show on TV was amazing, but we need see it at movies. The mix between stories about X Men was marvelous. The contrast color between future and present is other character in this movie.All actors are BIG. Filled with action, but a very good story, and mixing mutant activities with human history. The photography is very good, the music too. The participation of Peter Dinklage is the spice in this movie. You need to see it. And the final scene pots credits is....When the movie comes to end, you want to see more, and more, and more",10,7,11,25 May 2014
X-Men: Apocalypse," Fantastic !!!
","I enjoyed a lot this new movie about X MEN, because of the actors, the photographs, the locations, and the story. It have fantastic scenes that you are going to enjoy, if you liked X MEN. The music is very good. It remembered me the TV cartoon series. I liked The role of Jennifer Lawrence. You are going to enjoy action scenes, but it has also interesting dialogues, the X MEN saga takes continuity strong with this new movie. Remember see the post-credits scene. The story takes place during 80's. It is linked very well to X MEN: First class, and X MEN: Days of future past. Quick Silver is spectacular. In 3D the movie works very well.",10,6,16,21 May 2016

My family and I enjoyed plenty. Not all thinking are like we supposed. Characters have yet some secrets. It's a fantastic movie.",Null,2,6,29 April 2017
Edge of Tomorrow," Interesting story
","Like other people, I like this movie. It take again the idea of extraterrestrial versus humanity, a common topic inclusive on video games. This is the third movie were Tom Cruise confront extraterrestrial. The cast is very good. I like the scenes about London and Paris. It remember Day 'D'. The sound effects are incredible. The story is good, and you can't imagine the role performance by Tom Cruise. I liked photography a lot. Some of the quotes are good. It's a good sci fi film, and it is a good start for summer. Some scenes are inclusive funny. One thing is true in this movie: Since start to end you are going to be attending all action on screen.",8,1,2,8 June 2014
The Conjuring," True suspense
",The horror genre is privileged enjoy it when the story without obvious or grotesque images. This movie is an example of that.The story is powerful. You can't stay indifferent to the events on the screen. I enjoyment it in the middle of a movie theater only accompanied by my wife. A great movie.The recreation and music of the era in which the act is successful. Presence of 'Annabelle' doll is very good for starting the movie. The lighting becomes a character over plot. The casting seems appropriate. the locations of the movie are also great for the plot.Awoke in me the interest to learn more about The Warren.,9,0,2,29 September 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," ...You need to watch
","We have many expectedness about these movie, specially because we read about these stories at comics and the transition from the comic to the movie is not a easy work. I enjoyed the movie because I like both main characters. Also it was the opportunities to have a very good family time. I think that it is a very good effort from DC to have his own space at screens versus Marvel, many of the comics' characters need this opportunity for be known by the public. I want to see the next DC's movies to come. I don't like some specific details, but in general terms It is a good movie. The best criticize is going to be yours when you have watched the movie.",9,6,9,27 March 2016
Godzilla," Just old style
","I think this new version of Godzilla, really is just first movie about Godzilla. Japan is the origin of story, and many close circumstances. I think the monster is fantastic.The story is good, It could be better. The cast was good. The music is regular. It should be a mix between American pop music and traditional Asian music. The visual effects are good. The sets are fantastic, I would like see bigger sets. Costume design and make up are enough. Sound it's incredible, specially Godzilla 'voice'.It's not a children movie, It's for adults that watch 'Godzilla' when they were children.",8,8,16,7 June 2014
Furious 7," Great
","Little by little 'Fast & Furious' saga include new places, new challenges and (of course), new drivers. The main interesting on public was the facts related with Paul Walker, but the story was good. The action scenes goes beyond physical rules (for funny), the cars are incredible, doing new things, that perhaps we did only with our toys. the music is in accordance with the story, also dialogs, inclusive little ads. Entertaining for 'big boys' but also for girls. When i watch first movie about this saga i was very skeptical but now all movies that make up the saga are on my favorite's list movie. In Mexico is first office office for three weeks.",8,3,7,25 April 2015
