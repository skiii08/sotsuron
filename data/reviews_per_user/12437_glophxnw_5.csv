Blade Runner 2049," Over-rated
","The Most Unneeded Sequel In The GalaxyBoring acting, slow-motion directing, impossible cloned story, less than zero character development, plot holes ahoy and then you have the inexplicable elements that remind the viewer of Battlefield Earth and Ishtar of course. I rather get a job at McDonalds than watch these so-called sequels. Thanks for ruining the mystique of the original!3 Stars because I would love to come home and have my wife arrange a threesome for me.",3,17,29,15 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," A Threat Siren
","You see the names ' Disney' or 'Bad Robot' or 'Kathleen Kennedy' or 'J J Abrams' on the screen and turn off the TV or exit the cinema and run. Run away before your sensibilities and brain and senses are destroyed, assaulted and insulted.The Rise Of Skywalker is a joke. not the usual Disney stupid jokes, but a joke that shows how much humanity has devolved (that that climate chaos seriously, folks. It destroys brains). The acting is so one-note and the storyline so predictable and cliche ridden. The most fascinating part is that it has nothing to do with Star Wars. The force and the jedi are tropes being abused and deployed as a farce by JJ Abrams.",2,15,23,15 February 2020
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It Is Titanic In Space
","This used to be the worst Star Wars film until the new Disney 'Star Wars' came along.
LMAO at the picnic scene where the hormonal teenager expresses his horniness to the so-called Senator/Queen/useless character.",3,2,3,15 February 2020
Baby Driver," Fun And Entertaining
","There is some good acting in this film, fun action, violence and humanity too. There is some flaunting and a mini-skirted beauty who rocks fine skin and exquisite legs.

Annihilation," A Metaphor For Cancer...
",".... that is Hollywood making films where no explanation is offered and no logic applies and no finale is given and no resolution is reached.Yes, it is cancer. A cancer to logic, film, cinema and human brain power.Three stars because we have a semi-sex scene (but no nudity so scratch that even).",3,10,17,15 February 2020
