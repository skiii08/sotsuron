The Incredible Hulk," Incredibly Embarrassing
","The Incredible Hulk is the black mark in the MCU that we don't like, but I'm going to.This film reaches new levels of terrible. The CGI is abysmal and the acting is at best awkward and at worst blatantly robotic. And I know this movie is 12 years old and that CGI has come a long way since then, but Iron Man puts this movie to shame. And The Incredible Hulk had a bigger budget.The amount of action in this movie is overwhelming. Like I criticised Iron Man for not having enough, but The Incredible Hulk goes too far the other way with action scenes lasting far too long and occurring far to frequently. Furthermore, I thought the lighting made it hard to see what was going on and the staging of the scenes was over massive areas that we couldn't actually tell what was happening.And finally, I cannot fathom why the 'villain' was designed to look so similar to Hulk. I found myself having to struggle to work out who was punching whom and who was dragging whom.The Incredible Hulk is about two hours too long and I hate it purely for it being the reason we haven't got a Hulk movie since.",1,0,1,5 April 2020
Finding Nemo," Memory of a Goldfish never been so accurate
","Finding Nemo is truly a brilliant film. And it is so for many reasons.The story of Finding Nemo is Pixar's simplest by this point. A fish, Nemo, goes missing and his father, Marlin, has to cross the ocean looking for him. It isn't this concept that makes Finding Nemo great, it is how they tell the story. Fish are honestly not something I have ever sympathised with. This film made me feel genuine disappointment and upset for Marlin, which was a surprising feeling.The characters we meet on this journey are really fun. They have fully realised, complex personalities. They are not just a set of one-note character traits. Humour in children's movies was usually traditional with slapstick and very blunt gimmicks. And Finding Nemo has moments of this. However, large sections of comedic portions in this movie is funny due to actual situational jokes the characters make. Comedic timing is as close to perfection as I've ever seen in an animated movie. And Finding Nemo should be applauded for that.The ending of Finding Nemo actually made me kind of emotional. Sounds crazy I know. We are watching the struggles of animated fish. But yeah it is what it is.Brilliant movie. Loved all of it. Would watch it over and over.",9,0,0,5 April 2020
"Monsters, Inc."," Animation at its finest
","Monsters Inc, like Toy Story is also a genius concept. The film works off the premise that children's bedroom closet doors operate as portals that allow monsters through them to scare them and obtain the energy released in the scream to fuel the monster world. I have no idea how this concept was thought up but it sets the movie up for a home run.These characters have fully realised and developed personalities. We see that their decisions have actual consequences and they feel more than one way about the events. We see internal conflict and for a movie animated 'lovable' monsters, that is really impressive.The chase scene at the end is staged and paced perfectly. Great story telling and really entertaining watching. It made me fall in love with these characters and really get on board with what they were trying to do. It culminates to a denouement that is satisfying, well thought out and fully rounded.Monsters Inc is Pixar doing what it does best.",9,0,0,5 April 2020
Inside Out," Childhood depression made quirky and interesting
","It's hard to simplify Inside Out into a few sentences. We follow a girl called Riley and the emotions in her head. Riley moves cross country from Minnesota to San Francisco. This has a mental impact on her and it unleashes havoc in her brain. The emotions have to get their act together before Riley falls into a permanent state of depression and causes irreparable damage to her brain.Inside Out is fantastic. There are so many fantastic touches added into this movie. I love that the emotions in the mother's head resemble the panel on the View. I love the dream sequence. I love the scene where the mind workers are deleting the memories that Riley doesn't need anymore. It is made with the same thought that was put into Monsters Inc and Finding Nemo.The message from the movie is entirely wholesome. I think it's a great message to give children that it is okay to feel more than one way about an event. We can't always be happy and always be angry. Inside Out shows us the issues with this. The only message that this movie proports that I am not so fond of is that the movie seems to say that when you are depressed, you are emotionless. You can be happy and depressed. You can also be angry and depressed. You can also be scared and depressed. Depression is more of a feeling of dejection and despondency, than it is emotionless.The ending is phenomenal. The scene where Riley enters the home actually made me feel so incredibly sad and happy at the same time. It is truly great cinema. Very impressed at Pixar pulling this off again. It puts itself on a list with Finding Nemo, Up and Toy Story 3.So why only a 7? While the plot of the real world Riley and the added touches Pixar throws in are great, the story of Joy trying to get back to headquarters is not as good. We fall into a repetition of 'there's only one way back to headquarters' then 'oh no, that was destroyed, now we can't get back' then 'there's only one other way back to headquarters'. This repeats about five times. It just got a little one note and, although it didn't become predictable, none of the revelations felt overwhelming.Overall, very much worth the watch. I cannot wait to rewatch it again. Great for kids and adults alike.",7,0,0,7 April 2020
Cars," Writing this review pains me
","So I have been working my way through all the Pixar movies and ranking them, removing the nostalgia as best as I can. Look if it were about nostalgia, Cars would be the landslide victor. I got to see the movie while in the USA on holiday and it is my earliest memory of the cinema.For anyone who hasn't worked it out, Cars works on the premise that Cars are animated and sentient beings, that compete in races and have millions of fans. Enter Lightening McQueen, who is a cocky prick that everyone loves because he impresses everyone by being a rookie who competes and ties with two other cars. The have to travel across the USA to race again and break the tie.The actual story of Cars is stellar. We see a real character arc develop for Lightening McQueen. It is the exact stuff a children's movie should be made out from. The message is wholesome and as the story develops, we see interesting side characters, tragic backstories and perfectly-timed comedy.However, here's the catch. Pixar movies are great because of all the details that are thrown in. But in this movie, the added details do not make sense. I have a massive list of these that I'm not going to write out for your own sanity. It is frustrating because so much of the story is great. And the soundtrack is next level top notch.Overall, I love this movie. But the small details that created plot holes, or loose ends made me deduct a couple stars from my rating. Don't avoid watching it.",7,0,0,6 April 2020
The Incredibles," Incredible in more ways than one
","The Incredibles creates an exciting world where superheroes have been oppressed and tells the story of a family of superheroes trying to maintain a cover in suburban life. However, their cover cannot last forever and they have to act to save the world.The family dynamic in The Incredibles is brilliant. It feels real and is an accurate depiction of the busy life of an American family. It also provides the main source of humour for the movie. And following in the footsteps of Finding Nemo, it also has humour on a similar level.Also, for it being a kids' movie, I actually didn't see the plot twist coming. It made total sense and I thought it was really intriguing as a story line. Furthermore, all of the plot points are brought fully circle and make for really enjoyable watching. The scene attacking Syndrome was very well put together and the soundtrack makes it all the better.This is one of the best Pixar movies and indeed superhero movies. At the time of the realise the MCU hadn't even begun yet. Really entertaining viewing.",8,0,0,5 April 2020
Cars 2," Cars crashed
","Do I even bother? I liked this as a kid. Why? I have absolutely no idea.In Cars 2, Lightening McQueen takes to the world stage and races against global racers. He struggles to keep up with the best of the best. However, while this is all going on, somehow Mater falls into being a spy. There's like a conspiracy and espionage and a whole pile of strange dealings.The issues with this movie can be broken down as four things. Firstly, they introduce a really mediocre set of characters that fails in comparison to the set of characters from Cars 1. There's a reason none of them feature in Cars 3. They don't have personalities and are barely more than just thoughts.Secondly, the plot doesn't really go anywhere. There are so many changes in direction it feels stationary. The plot twists feel like they were thrown in last minute. Who came up with this and thought it was a good idea? Like I sat there in such a confusion. I, an adult, couldn't work out where it was going at all. One of the best parts of spy movies is guessing what is going to happen. But you can't even do that, because the information required isn't revealed until forty seconds before it is revealed. Frustrating is an understatement.Thirdly. I just can't with the soundtrack. The soundtrack of Cars was brilliant. The soundtrack of Cars 2 is comparatively nothing. I didn't feel like it had really anything to do with the actual movie. And it's not the songs chosen are bad, they aren't. It's just they don't feel like they were thought out and placed with the same intention of Cars. I read up about Cars and they picked Chuck Berry song that his record company didn't even know existed. That same level of thought was not put in for Cars 2.Finally, I have a theory. I think Pixar wanted to make a spy movie. And they realised that it would be hard to create spy characters that kids could empathise with and tell the entire story they had planned. So they did something I have never seen Pixar do before. They didn't even try. They just bent tried and tested characters to a story they like and rolled with it. I am sorry but for me that is not good enough.I don't know if I have ever been so disappointed. Really not worth watching.",2,1,3,7 April 2020
Brave," A Brave effort
","Brave is about Merida, a Scottish princess who doesn't want to get married so badly that she turns to witchcraft to get out of it.Here's the thing about Brave. It is very much a one-time go sort of movie. If I had no idea what was happening, it would be great. The best part of this movie occurs half way through. And the plot advances at a snails pace to get it there. I don't like using the term boring, as I think interest is subjective. But looking at it as objectively as I can, waiting nearly an hour for something to happen is boring. I was constantly checking the time bar. As soon as we got there, it got going well. It was funny, unpredictable, sad and fast paced.However, Brave suffers for another reason. Pixar had been criticised for their lack of female protagonists and this is their response. We see this happen in a couple of movies. They try to show that girls have power too. Not that it isn't true, it is. But it overwhelms the movie. The fact of the matter is that in this time period women did have little control over their lives. I don't think this is the direction they needed to go in order to show this message.Finally, they try to make Merida a quirky and relatable character. And I totally understand why? However something about a girl with a bow and an arrow feels predictable and cliché to me. It has picked up off the Hunger Games buzz and although Brave doesn't suffer because of this, it does make the whole archery scene feel overdone.Overall, worth watching. It is good. I think it could be better. It is very much harkening back to the Disney princess days and I enjoyed that.",6,0,0,7 April 2020
A Bug's Life," Just OK
","Pixar were really still finding there feet with A Bug's Life. There's nothing really wrong with it. It is just a little dull.A Bug's Life centres on the life of a bug. Funny that. Name of Flick. Flick's ant colony gets attacked by grasshoppers, seemingly frequently. They exploit them for food. When the ants try to stand up for themselves, they get intimidated and the grasshoppers demand their entire food supply.However, the grasshoppers don't really feel like a threat. I kept thinking that with the number of ants in the colony, they could easily defeat the band of 20 grasshoppers. And at one point in the movie the grasshoppers literally spell it out, but for some reason it goes nowhere.The circus characters are supposed to be quirky and funny. I personally don't find 'look at how stupid I am' humour to be funny and the circus is filled with this. It felt like irony to me. Really the only character who is funny is the ladybird. The delivery of his lines and his comic timing is almost perfect. However, it saddens me that it wasn't achieved by the other characters. They became reduced to a few character traits and little depth of personality.And finally, the plot has two clichÃ©s that I really cannot abide in a film. Firstly, the plot hinges on the character overhearing the master plan of the grasshoppers, who just happen to be talking about it out loud, in detail, for no reason. It just didn't make sense. And secondly, the bugs aren't really responsible for their own victory. The bird just happened to be there and just happened to need to feed its baby birds that just conveniently hatched very recently. It didn't feel calculated or planned, which frustrated me.Overall, I think A Bug's Life is OK. I would be mad about having to watch it again. I mainly think Pixar was still finding its feet and it shows in A Bug's Life.",4,1,3,5 April 2020
Toy Story," Unpopular Opinion Time
","Toy Story was a breakthrough movie in film history. Modern animation and children's story telling would not be where it is today without it and I give it full credit for that. However, I don't think Toy Story has aged well.Toy Story works off the premise that toys come to life when the kids that own them aren't looking. Bloody brilliant. Pure genius. This is the best part about Toy Story. And it has some of the most famous lines in cinema history.However, we spend a very large portion of Toy Story trying to convince Buzz that he is in fact a toy. And very little else happens. It just feels repetitive and very one note. The 'villain' is supposed to be creepy but comes across lame and weird.The thing that I personally love about this franchise is the amazing set of fully realised side characters. But when I rewatched Toy Story, I discovered that they really do not play a part at all in this movie. Rex, Ham, Mr Potato Head, Slinky, barely show up and that really disappointed me.Overall, Toy Story is good and is a really enjoyable family film. However, the newer instalments are the real draw to Pixar.",6,0,3,5 April 2020
Up," Hit and miss home run
","In Up, we follow Carl Fredricksen, a widower and retired balloon salesman, who doesn't want his home to be destroyed by the development of commercial buildings, so attaches hundreds of balloons to it and flies it to Paradise Falls, him and his wife's dream destination.Up is great. It's a fun, family film. The story is interesting and very engaging. However, the movie falls into two very obvious sections for me and I will review them as such.The first section is the development of the story, right up to the point they reach Paradise Falls. This section is brilliant. Really great viewing. The beginning flashback sequence with Ellie is absolute perfection. It harkens back to the WALL-E and Ratatouille-esque silent story telling technique. It evokes a real sense of emotion while watching.The second section is where Up loses steam for me. I think the humour becomes overly slapstick and for me, was hit and miss at times. Doug the dog provides comic relief and the 'point' joke I found funny. However, I felt Russell became very silly. He is obviously an intelligent boy, but some of what he says and does doesn't reflect this.However, in saying all of this, I think Up ends strongly. I really appreciate what how it wraps up and it redeemed some of my earlier grievances.Overall, Up is brilliant. I don't think you're missing out on much if you skip it, but I still think it is worth watching.",8,0,0,6 April 2020
WALL·E," Animation at its best
","I normally fully respect people who choose to disagree with me. Opinions and all that at the end of the day. However, I honestly cannot see how you cannot fall in love with WALL-E. The few people who told me they disagreed claim 'it's boring'. Although I take the stance that interest is entirely subjective. When I use the phrase 'boring', to me it means a large section of the movie where the plot is simply not advancing. You cannot say that about WALL-E.In WALL-E, humans have destroyed the planet and have left to live in space. It's up to WALL-E to compact the rubbish so that the Earth can support life again. A new robot, called EVE is sent to Earth to look for signs of life. And she finds a plant.This is Pixar's most ambitious film. WALL-E could have completely missed the mark. However, this is Pixar and of course it doesn't. WALL-E is one of, if not the most, original movies I have ever had the pleasure of watching. It is a modern masterpiece and will go down in history as one of the greatest films of all time.Incredible characterisation. These robots have real emotions and react to the events of the movie with rational responses. The meticulously thought out plot has an attention to detail that is almost Kubrickan. The soundtrack and sound design are perfection. WALL-E is also Pixar's greatest love story.What floors me is that the first half of WALL-E has no dialogue. We've seen Pixar dip their toe into trying this before. It is this that tipped the scale into obtaining a perfect rating. I honestly cannot fathom how they managed to tell a story as complex and intricate as WALL-E without dialogue. Makes it truly great watching.Phenomenal on a fundamental level. WALL-E is for all ages. Watch it now.",10,0,0,6 April 2020
Iron Man," RDJ saved more than lives
","This movie had a lot to prove. With a bad run of superhero movies, Marvel had to pull something out of the bag. And they did with Iron Man. This movie is great, there is absolutely no doubt about that. Marvel would simply not be where it is without Iron Man.The story is engaging and creative. Characters have been well developed and there are moments of genuine humour. However, for an action movie, I would like some more action. There are large sections of the film completely devoid of action.Robert Downey Jr. is a great choice for a movie like this. However, some of the acting in Iron Man is a little hit and miss. Some lines just felt unnatural and over expositional and the delivery of the dialogue felt stilted. To be clear, this was just in select scenes.This is a strong start to the MCU and I am excited to continue.",7,0,0,5 April 2020
Monsters University," A prequel that's almost as good as the original
","Monsters University tells the story of how Mike and Sully, the lovable characters from Monsters Inc, meet at university. It tells of their conflict and their struggle to get to where they are in Monsters Inc.There is only one thing wrong with Monsters University. It makes plot holes with the original. And I really hate that it does. Because in and of itself, Monsters University has a fantastic and engaging story. Although it doesn't create a world itself, the campus of the university is done to perfection. Every little detail is thought of. I can tell that the writers really looked around at a campus and thought 'how can we make this monster-ish' and it shows.The cast of characters is amazing. They all have realised personalities and it makes for great watching. Dean Abigail Hardscrabble is simply an incredible addition. She feels like a genuine monster and I very much enjoyed the scenes she was in. Furthermore, due to the scare course they have created for the movie, it makes the last scene where they put it to action really intriguing. We see how the course mixes with their personality and limitations. Really fantastic.However, a small personal thing about characters that I would have loved to see and I'm not annoyed it didn't happen, I just wanted to see what Pixar would have done with it. I would love to have seen Celia Mae (The snake-cyclops hybrid) appear, however briefly. Perhaps in the background, revealed her major and maybe shown why Mike was so obsessed with her in Monsters Inc. Just a thought.Randall's backstory is a detail thrown in at the end and it's really clever. I wasn't expecting it to appear the way it did. I was expecting the reason to be simply just that Sully stole Mike from him. Put in true Pixar fashion my expectations were subverted and I loved what they did with it.Another detail I absolutely adored was the fact that we saw the scare floor at several different generations. And what I loved about this is that we see that the monsters become more diverse the more generations we go down. It showed that children became harder to scare and the need for stranger and creepier monsters. A touch that I thought inspired.Overall, great watching and if it weren't for those plot holes, would be a certain favourite.",8,2,2,7 April 2020
Toy Story 3," Toy Story in all of its glory
","Yeah Toy Story 3 is brilliant. I remember not loving it as a kid when I went to see it. And honestly, now I don't remember why. I enjoyed this from the very start, right until the very end.Toy Story 3 is centred around Andy moving to college and having to either get rid, donate or store away his toys. They all end up in Sunnyside Daycare and havoc ensues.Toy Story 3 combines the best parts of both Toy Story and Toy Story 2. We see the conflict of opinion and the fantastic ensemble cast. An incredible amount is packed into this hour and a half and it is truly great. The story comes completely full circle with the aliens.Overall, great funny movie. Well worth the watch.",9,0,0,6 April 2020
