The Blair Witch Project," Please... For the love of God go see this movie!
","This movie is one of the most fascinating I've ever seen. This kind of raw injection, filmed entirely with handcameras, switching between black and white and color, no soundtrack with the latest hits in popular music, no superhuman leadcharacters, no people with inhumanly good looks etc etc goes against all what the market controlled Hollywood of today stands for.The backstory of this movie alone raises an eyebrow or two. And the movie itself do not let you down. Three innocent students in the woods, making an innocent documentary. But the subject of the documentary seem to mind, and their terror begin. They have nowhere to go in the woods, evil is all around, and all hope begins to fade. The haunting of the little team is portrayed in an absolutely horrific way, which compared to the trend of the late 90'ies in horror is stunning. The basic idea, which is greatly inspired by Cannibal Holocaust should be mentioned.The Blairwitch Project will undeniably become a classic in horror, nestling right beside the likes of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Suspiria, The Haunting (1963) and Last House on the Left.",9,1,2,5 July 1999
