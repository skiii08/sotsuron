10 Cloverfield Lane," I believe 10 Clover field lane is a great movie that had excellent characters and a good story
","10 Clover field lane is something of a different film. It is a story of that I have never heard before in a film. The characters in this film are built up throughout the film adding traits and something different to the film. The story is interesting and without going into to much, it is a good story with twists and turns throughout. The development of the plot exceeds in the pacing of the film. It paces itself quite well with one or two scenes getting a bit boring and slow but the story revels things in a great fashion. My biggest downside to this film is the ending, I wont say much but it's something to think about for me. The films marketing was very odd yet the film still grossed a lot. For me this film is a perfect mixture of suspense, drama and action.",8,0,2,21 April 2016
