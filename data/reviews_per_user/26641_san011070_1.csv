Alien 3," Awful Orphan!
","Its just an spoiled orphan, nothing else. It could not inherit any of the virtues from ancestors!When I got the movie, gave few rapid peeps into it, and I knew how disappointing it could get, but yet could not believe myself!Anyway, other reviewers have nothing left for me to write about, so I just wanna add few points: The story is so predictable...the characters, the plot - everything was so dull, so boring...but that could still be digested. What I cud not digest was - how the SFX guys also did such an awful job, just 1 YEAR PRIOR TO 'JURRASIC PARK'? Even the creature is so boring. I have an DivX version, even there I could clearly see strong, dark-green (sometimes green) borders of the superimposed alien model. More amusing : while it is moving fast, its body is blurred, but its outlines were still sharp - as if its a paper cut! While running, it looked rather like an exceptionally thin panther. No wonder Pete Postlethwaite (last 23rd min) called it 'Kitty Kitty Kitty' :-)In the same scene, he thrown his torch to the alien. he torch passes by it lighting the creature and its background. Its ridiculous why those unskilled hands even planned such an complex scene. Pl. slow down and enjoy the scene! The lighting effect must had been created frame by frame by some amateur, the contrast, darkness levels of the alien did not match with background, plus, that strong border paper-cut effect again.Last but not least: Slow down the scene when the alien was smashed by one convict, by dropping a metal door on the alien, you can see the alien falls down before the door actually hits it!The Ripley jumping into furnace is also poor, looked like a fire / flame effect from Max Payne Game.Bottom line: They taught us how not to make a sequel!",1,0,3,29 April 2010
