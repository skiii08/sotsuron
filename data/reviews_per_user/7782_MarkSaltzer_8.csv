Deja Vu," Back To The Future 4 The DRAMA
","This movie as with most movies was marketed sneakily. The trailer made you think it was Deja Vu but in reality it was TIME TRAVEL.This movie wreaks of plot holes, but the biggest problem was the forced scriptwriting to get Denzel into action sequences that were a joke. Apart from the fact that he probably killed several people in the car chase, this was totally unnecessary. For a US Government, Black Ops kind of project, surely if the glimpses of the past 4 days camera goes out of range it would be easier to have a helicopter with a receiver mounted to it to access out of range footage.Come on, sending a guy out in a truck with a helmet that let's you see the 4 days ago NOW, would be the dumbest car chase in Hollywood history, accept for Blues Brothers, but that's a comedy.The scriptwriters had a 22 minute twilight zone episode to work with and were forced to flesh it out in the typical Hollywood formulaic style. BRING BACK TWILIGHT ZONE.The whole thing with the red laser light piercing the time space continuum was in word, LAME, so was throwing a desk chair at highly intricate technology that could create a time space paradox or shut down the entire network, was very immature.If accessing the past was the case, and the fact that they could send back a note stating the facts of the future, why didn't they just send back another note to any one of the characters, like say VAL KILMER or his boss, or the DEJA VU computer geeks. One successful attempt and they give up, only to use a Special Helmet that blocks the vision of the driver. Come on, it's almost as if George Bush was one of the script writers.The clincher was after stating that sending a fly and a small animal back in time failed miserably, why then would they bother sending a human, also why didn't Denzel (A Brilliant Actor, just a bad Agent, where's Ari when you need him), strip down to the Full Monty for his time travel trip, even Arnie traveled back in time naked in T1 and T2.All in all this movie was a multi million dollar Twilight Zone episode that really needed some love and attention to bring it up to speed.Oh Jerry, Terry and Ted let some new writing blood on to the lot, who knows you might earn millions and educate your audience all at the same time.It seems TV is starting to, or already is, out writing FILMS.",3,1,3,23 August 2007
Cloverfield," Superb Execution - The Best Sci Fi Reality Film Ever
","Currently in the middle of watching Cloverfield for the second time and I have to admit the second time round, forgetting all the hype, this is an incredible film. The attention to detail of the film, the production design, the acting and the gritty one camera filming is nothing short of superb and flawless. While watching the film you feel immersed in the action and it really is a good survival guide for disasters, so long as you're single.If reality TV is so cool, then a reality Movie, even though it is fictional and full of breathtaking effects, is a breath of fresh air for Hollywood and I for one think it's one of the coolest takes on Sci Fi in Hollywood's history.Two thumbs up for Cloverfield.",10,4,7,9 November 2009
The Bourne Identity," Good Film Bad Title
",If only this movie had anything to do with the Robert Ludlum novel it could have been a great movie. The big question is did the screenwriters actually read the novel of the same name. If Hollywood cannot bring a screenplay together that holds true to the original novel then they should leave the project alone. This movie would have been far more popular if the title had have been 'No Identity'. Cashing in on a successful novel is great provided the movie is actually similar to the novel. Perhaps Peter Jackson should have written and directed 'The Bourne Identity'.,Null,0,1,17 October 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Finally, The Bar Is Raised The Competition Is On.
","Well it's taken a while but finally Peter Jackson has taken Hollywood by storm and actually shown them how to deliver an entertaining movie that keeps the storyline in tact and visualises the mastery, mysticism and grandeur that is J.R.R. Tolkien.Gollum is nothing short of Breathtaking. The Academy need to add a new Acting Award to the Oscars in the very near future. Best Performace by a Digital Character. Gollum's presence in the film was felt in a way only human actors can deliver. 'Weta Effects' should be proud of their skills and talents in bringing Numbers together on a PC to give life to a character that makes the human audience Laugh, Cry and Feel Compassion.Although the movie was slow in places overall it was a great film. 9/10 is an accurate score.On a difference note, my Friend & I do have a question to ask either Peter Jackson (Screenplay) or Mr. Tolkien's estate (Novel). Q: If Saruman has the technology for his troops to fire large crossbow catapults over the walls. Why then didn't they just simply fasten the gunpowder bombs to them and fire them over the wall. Seems it would have been smarter to do that then have an Orc run up to the castle carrying the Bomb.Also in an earlier scene, Saruman let's Wormtongue know he has stumbled upon this new form of Weaponry. Wormtongue brings the candle closer to the gunpowder (Secret Weapon) and Saruman fends him off for obvious reasons. If this secret weapon 'GUNPOWDER' is so secret or such a new threat to the kingdom of man, then why did Gandalf have a wagon full of Fireworks for all to see in the Hobbiton Shire. If Saruman was as clever as he looks don't ya think he would have invented the Gun. Even the Chinese used rockets in war when they discovered that Fireworks could be fired in a certain direction. Look at Mulan. I guess Saruman... I mean Christopher Lee is overworked from his appearances in two of the biggest franchises in Hollywood History. Hey I know maybe Christopher could take over the role of Dumbledore in Harry Potter.",Null,0,0,30 December 2002
Clash of the Titans," Entertaining None The Less
","The story may be a copy of the 1981 Classic, but who cares, this version was well executed with visual effects that did it justice. The adventure was well worth the watch. The performances were typical of a Hollywood blockbuster, but after all the negative feedback on my shoulders, I was still able to carry myself through this film without complaining once. Everything from the costumes and production design to the visual effects and stunt work was spot on. Excellent detail and a black Pegasus just to keep the political correctness in place, probably would have been a white Pegasus if Bush was still in power. Highly recommend this film for those of us who enjoy a good adventure even if it is a stylish and well executed rehash.Footnote: This came directly from IMDb news updates.Warner Brothers is backing a 'REMAKE' of Ray Harryhausen's Clash of the Titans and has attracted some first rate talent to the project.",8,1,2,28 August 2010
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Awesome!
","I tried but I couldn't picture any other actor playing the role of Joel Barrish. Jim Carrey was superb. Kate Winslett was also brilliant, she has this amazing ability to make you fall in love with her characters. Sterling effort. The rest of the wonderful cast were so perfect it helped make the leads shine. You know something, to tell you the truth, the whole film is a masterpiece. Charlie Kaufmann's script was once again mentally challenging and fantastic. Well done to the Production Team, I loved 21 Grams too, it was an amazing movie. It's wonderful to see a new quality and standard coming out of Hollywood today. Movies for the mind, after all it's about time our mental diet got some real nutrition instead of all the fast food we're served by the toxic fox... I mean box. Please don't Supersize Me.",10,1,3,17 March 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," The Novelty Wears Off Quickly
","He's no James Bond but I'm sure he'll get the franchise milked out of him until he is petrified like the HalfBlood Wizards in the movie. The movie itself was just like the first, the storyline was just like the first, same spells, same Quidditch, same characters and even the same bad guy. Apart from a house elf, a screaming Mandrake weed, Oh and not to mention the Eight Legged Freaks and a tree cinematically reminiscent of Poltergiest; there were no real exciting moments in the movie to rival the first. I guess that's why there was no sequels to E.T. or Willy Wonka. Of course if you are to create a character for recurring storylines take a leaf out of the Indiana Jones and James Bond movies. Location Location Location. I'm sure Indiana Jones would be just as exciting if all his movies were set in the Temple of Doom. I hope the next instalment sees Harry's adventures locate to London for some Muggledom Antics with the powers that be.Oh and when I get round to it I will read the novels. In fact I will read the novels before I see the next cinematic version of the literary classic.And on a personal note, the IMDB should remove the line in the first comment by dsbauer99@yahoo.com Illonois referring to the late, great actor of the 20th Century, Richard Harris as kicking the bucket. A fine human being should be remembered with dignity and his passing was not a matter of kicking the bucket but a great loss to the film industry as well as the Harry Potter Franchise.",Null,0,0,3 December 2002
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Plain Jane and John Doe
","True Lies was a far superior version of this mistaken identity Secret Agent storyline. This script had potential but it went no-where. I heard it took 50 drafts to get it right and an abundance of writers. Seems Hollywood is still a fickle industry.Do the actors actually read the script before they sign on, and if they do is it the same as the final movie release script. If this is the case then Pitt and Jolie need to take a long hard look at themselves. And why was Osama Bin Laden's painting on the ensuite wall in their house. 15 minutes into the film you will see what I am talking about, can someone tell me what this portrait signifies.",1,4,9,22 January 2006
