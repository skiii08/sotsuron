Walk the Line," wow
","I love Johnny Cash, always have since my dad listened to him, in our small home, in the 1960's and 1970's as I was growing up. This movie is amazing, even for a newcomer to JR cash, this is a MUST SEE movie. The acting was amazing. Reese did an amazing job, and was rewarded well with her award. The story telling was done in a concise manner, and appreciation for the difficulty that Johnny Cash had with Drugs and the toll it took on his personal life, is a story worth understanding. I was quite interested in the storyline in regards to the loss of his brother, and the influence it had on Johnny's life, in a personal way, and in a musical influence. His challenging relationship with his father was very surprising to me as well, previously unknown to me, and I am sure many others too. A well rounded story that came across as one of the finest movies I have seen. If you have any old memories of Johnny Cash, this will create a spark in your noggin.",10,0,0,19 March 2006
