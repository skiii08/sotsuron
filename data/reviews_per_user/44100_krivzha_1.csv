Catch Me If You Can," No one can keep their eyes off those damn pinstripes
","How can that be real? The question covers not only the real story of Frank Abagnale Jr., but also the film itself. Steven Spielberg, Jeff Nathanson, John Williams, and the whole cast caught me from the very beginning of the film. Not unnaturally, that all the scams of real Frank Abagnale Jr. were romanticized, to say nothing of his relations with other characters, though, the historical inaccuracy is not that huge, and the film itself manages to knock a viewer off their pins. The list of worth-watching biopics is simply too short and Catch me if you can, with no doubt, ranks if not the first but at least the second in this list.
Here is a young man, who escaping his parents' divorce flung himself whole-heartedly into check forgery and impersonating other people. Steven Spielberg uses all his filmmaking experience to present the story of this young man in a way that after end of the film a viewer starts to scrutinize the Internet to know more about the real Frank Abagnale Jr., and to know more details about his life. The same manages to achieve the main actor Leonardo DiCaprio, and it is worth mentioning that Leonardo DiCaprio playing a role of impersonator impersonated not only a pilot, doctor and parish prosecutor, but Frank Abagnale Jr. himself. Obviously, a great criminal story can't be without a great detective. In this case we have Carl Hanratty played by Tom Hanks who as usual presented high quality acting. And on the whole the music composed by John Williams adds a spice to this masterpiece of Steven Spielberg. From the very beginning of the film John Williams manages to deliver the main features of the film: intrigue, lightheartedness and intensity of narration.
The film is fantastic and catchy. Above all, the plot covers not only the cons of a criminal life having a great sum of money by fooling other people, but the consequences of hard life times as family divorce (it is worth mentioning that Steven Spielberg focused on this idea very strongly), loneliness, and violence of outer world. Great film, with wonderful screenplay, skillful actors, ingenious director and stunning story. Long story short, it is masterpiece.And remember, yankees always win because no one can keep their eyese off yankees' damn pinstripes.",10,0,1,19 February 2019
