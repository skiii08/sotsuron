The Blair Witch Project," Sick bag anyone?
","I liked this film, I liked it because it was different. It was a fairly original concept which is hard to come by these days. It also broke new ground by using marketing to it's full, I think more films will use the internet in future the way Blair Witch did. And why not? I doubt any other film could make the amount of profit which Blair Witch did but then again most films aren't made for the cost of a family car. It possibly suffered slightly from over hype but this didn't deter me from seeing it. I left this movie feeling sick, because I had eaten a big bag of skittles and a bag of popcorn and the camera work was incredibly shaky. I don't normally get motion sickness but this came close. It all added to the effect of the second best thriller this year (after sixth sense).",Null,1,2,22 November 1999
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Always look on the bright side of life !
","THE funniest film I have ever seen. It's one of those films where you don't need to watch it with other people to laugh at it. The first time I saw the Biggus Dickus sketch i laughed so much I hurt afterwards. The rest of the film was just as funny with sketches like getting punctuation lessons for graffiti, pondering over what exactly the Romans have achieved and Ceasers address to the crowds 'fwee Bwian'. If you like Monty Pythons usual strange sense of humour then you'll love this. There is just one part where Brian gets abducted by Aliens which kind of spoils the continuity of the film but above all a cracking good watch.",9,1,4,26 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," I really do know what I think..... Honest!!!
","*Definite Spoilers* (although you've probably read the book so you know whats going to happen anyway) I had my ticket bought when they went on sale over two weeks ago and I've never looked forward to a film so much. Was all of the anticipation going to have been worth it. Well, i've never left a film and criticised it so much on the way home. Did I hate this film I hear you ask? No. Far from it. This film could very well be the best film ever made. I've sat through a few similar length cinema films (Titanic, The Green Mile) and I thought they seemed to pass quicker the LOTR did but I'm not saying this dragged. If the next two are anything like this then this could be the best trilogy ever made. Criticise was the wrong word, it was more comparing where the film differed from the book and how things were omitted or changed. These differences didn't detract from the film especially if you've not read the book yet anyway. The opening fight sequence was just awesome, much better than Gladiators opening battle sequence. The special effects all they way through were totally believable. New Zealand's unspoilt countryside was utterly breathtaking, this film could not have been made anywhere else. Tolkien's descriptive writing made Jackson's job easier when it came to landscapes. It's almost as if Tolkien had New Zealand in mind when he wrote it. I think the audience I watched  it with mostly hadn't read the book because when Gandalf falls there was complete and total silence in the cinema, you could feel the sense of shock.The ending wasn't as much of a cliffhanger as the book leaves it but I think it works equally as well this way. I was unhappy on leaving the cinema because my near 3 hour rollercaoster ride was over and apart from experiencing it again i have to wait a whole year for the next trip. In the meantime I suppose I'll just have to go and see this one again and again and again and again.......",Null,0,0,20 December 2001
BASEketball," I hate South Park!
","This little gem from the creators of south park is one of the funniest films I've seen in quite a while and that means quite a lot because I can not stand south park. I think it's tasteless and not funny in the slightest which really surprised me that I liked it but then again it did have Yasmine Bleeth. Trey Parker and Matt Stone really made a great dou and, I forget his name but Squeak 'little Bitch' scolari was superb as the weedy little sidekick who was a constant source of fun for everyone else. If you like South Park you'll probably love this and even if you just like a good comedy and aren't too offended by a lot of language you should like this, SEE IT!",Null,0,2,4 June 2000
The Princess Bride," True Family Entertainment!
","What can I say about this film? It is one of my all time favourites that has a truly superb cast mixing well know and established actors (Billy Crystal, Peter Cooke, Peter Falk) with at the time unknowns (Carey Elwes, Robin Wright). I watched this many times as a kid not appreciating various aspects but watching it now I realise how corny it is in places and that only adds to the films excellence, this film could not have been totally serious with Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Peter Cooke as the impressive Clergy Man. This is one the whole family can enjoy, either together or alone. Every so often a true Gem of a film comes along and this was one. If you have the misfortune not to have seen this film then I highly recommend it, if you have already seen it, I'm sure you love it and I urge you to watch it again.",9,1,2,17 February 2000
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," America, this is how you do it!!!!!
","A film does not need shed loads of sfx and huge name 'movie stars' to be entertaining, this film has neither sfx or movie stars, it has brilliant camerawork and ACTORS. This film covers a lot of genres, it is a comedy with great lines and visual gags, it is a drama which gets into all the characters (especially directors cut), it is a thriller which really keeps you on the edge of your seat. While checking out the comments posted by imdb users for this film I found that the only negative comments were by Americans which was unsurprising. A few Americans didn't slag it off, they obviously appreciated what the film was. As is typical of America they wouldn't recognise a decent plot if it jumped up and bit them in the a**e! This is the way comedy should work, americans are too reliant on the quick one line gag comedies of Friends, Frasier and all the other less entertaining programmes of that type they tend to label as 'comedy'. I will admit I do like Friends and Frasier but I don't what that type of humour in my films. I was lucky when I saw this film because I saw it in the cinema just as it came out and I knew absolutely nothing about it, someone recommended it to me and I watched it. I don't think I've ever seen a film with such a clever plot. If I was to compare it to a film churned out by hollywood the closest would not be anything Tarrantino has to offer but something much cleverer like the Game with Michael Douglas. It's about time that hollywood realised that good film making is about quailty not quantity. I like a good explosion laden, sfx laden flick as much as the next guy but there are times and there are places for that sort of thing. Come on America, wake up if you put stronger plots and stronger acting in your films you wouldn't feel the need to slag off a decent british film that has everything you don't.",Null,0,0,9 October 2000
The Sixth Sense," Bravo Bruce!
","I made a fatal error when I saw this film, I knew what the twist was and that kind of spoilt it a bit for me. However it is still one of the best films I have seen for quite some time. It had me glued to my seat for the whole duration of the film. I think Bruce Willis was superb as Dr. Crowe, he truly proved he can do something other than wear a blood and dirt stained vest. It would be great to see Bruce do something like this again.",Null,0,0,19 November 1999
The Truman Show," Why?
","I really hate Jim Carrey and my friends assured me I would like this film. How wrong could they be? I thought this movie was terrible, I can't see how anyone can like such an evil concept because that is what it is. A person lives their entire life for the satisfaction and enjoyment of a population of sickminded couch potatoes. To keep someone in a place and intrude on their life is not in my mind good viewing but evil. Ed Harris' character should have been arrested for kidnapping not given awards. I thought Carrey's acting was just the same as the rest of his stuff just toned down slightly. The ending was totally implausible and unbelievable. I do not have one nice thing to say about this film, all Truman's co-workers obviously were too greedy to see what they were doing was wrong. I know it is just a film but with the way television is going this type of thing is potentially just round the corner and it will be a big mistake the day that someone actually does this. This film is totally unbelievable, a big waste of money and it was a complete waste of my time.",2,6,14,26 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Only the best film ever
",This film is possibly the most influential sci-fi film of all time. It set new ground for special effects and saw the establishment of a group of companies which are such a big part of the movie industry today not only in sci-fi but in all genres. In short George Lucas is a God,10,1,1,23 February 1999
The Thin Red Line," WHAT ?
","This film is the biggest waste of money ever and  I have seen Star Trek Insurrection.  This film is the worst ever.  Fair enough some of the acting was good, for example George Clooney's 2 minute appearance!  What was that all about?  His double looked nothing like him I only found that out by reading a paper!  This film is absolute rubbish and I strongly recommend that you DO NOT SEE THIS FILM!!!!!!!  out of 10 I would not even rate this film. It went on for too long and the interruptions of the animal scenes were in my opinion not necessary!  The film did not logically run through as there were jumps from one area to another for no reason!  The war tactics used were the biggest joke as to send troops up a hill in the line of fire is the biggest waste of human life I have ever witnessed in one film!  How this film was ever made I do not know.",Null,1,2,26 May 1999
