Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Trick of the Mind
","For those of you that haven't watched the first Sherlock Holmes it really does not matter. I am always effie about big box sequels because they are never really better than the first. However, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows is remarkably so much more exciting and smart than its predecessor and it made me laugh a ridiculous amount. The plot takes part months after the first movie, where Dr.John Watson (Jude Law) is about to marry his fianc√©e Mary (I must warn you that I had the most suspicious feeling about this 'wife' character and indeed she does play a pivotal role in the movie) and Inspector Sherlock Holmes (Robert Downey Jr) to be his best man and to throw his best friend and partner in solving crimes a stag party. Of course being Sherlock Holmes, he has other obsessions on his mind. Where this party takes place we get to meet the lovely Madame Simza, (played by a lovely and very bohemian Noomi Rapace, the Swedish superstar known for the Original Swedish version of 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo')and even though she has little dialogue in the film she goes along for the ride and stunts with the boys. This movie introduced Professor James Moriarty who is the complete duplicate of Holmes, if Holmes was evil and out to cause mass destruction. This adversary is perfect because whatever mind trick Holmes plans on executing, Moriarty is one step ahead of him. It's so smart to see how both characters think and play around with each other.You are thrown for a loop and at moments when you think one character has the upper hand the tables are turned. You really don't know who survives until the very end. This movie was so much fun, there was enough action and aerobatics that made the first Sherlock Holmes movie exciting and successful but always an equal amount of humour and cleverness for the fans of the old school Holmes. This movie was like a chess board. Never knowing you're opponent's move until it's done or when only a few chess pieces are left can you try to piece it together, but this movie has never once confirmed my predictions for what's going to happen next. Bravo Holmes and we must really ask the question: The End?",8,0,0,8 January 2012
Midnight in Paris," Oscar buzz, when Woody Allen plus talks of movies in movies is involved.
","If you don't know some of the historic icons that deeply influenced art and literature of our decade like Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, Cole Porter, or Gertrude Stein. . . than it really doesn't matter. . . much. To be honest I have not heard of half the characters in the film, i'm not a literature junkie nor had i read any of their works in class, so it was a bit hard to follow Gil's state of astonishment when he met them. I do however love Woody Allen's films and this film is definitely worth seeing. I'm sure you've read the synopsis and the movie is so much more than that! I won't include spoilers, but a hint: after midnight is when the magic really starts happening. The film transports you to another time, specifically the 1920s in Paris, and it is amazing. I am dying to go to Paris after this movie because you really fall in love with the city. The film showcases the best parts of Paris with great acting from Owen Wilson, Marion Cotillard, and surprisingly Rachel McAdams. (I did not like McAdam's character in this movie but she did it nicely, a more annoying version of Regina from Mean Girls)The actors that played the Fitzgeralds were amazing, Alison Pill and Tom Hiddleston, though i don't know how they really acted but it was a good interpretation. After seeing the characters you really understand Gil's fascination to learn more from them and just hang out with them. This movie has been a great nostalgic learning experience and it's something that I highly recommend to every romantic out there. Cole Porter's ' Let's do it, let's fall in love' is now my theme song. Midnight in Paris made me fall in love with old records, inspired me to read the Great Gatsby and I admire Woody Allen even more. It's a definite must watch of the year.",9,1,2,19 December 2011
Hugo," Hugo in 3D.
","It's that time of year, where all I do is put the Christmas records on repeat and watch any and all releases of Christmas themed movies (if the trailer has red, snow and Santa, I'll watch it). That entitles movies that have tragic beginnings, heartfelt moments, comedy and falling snow in some past century location. Hugo by Martin Scorsese embodies all of those aspects and more, much '3D' more. The setting was dazzling and story line incredible. I saw this movie with my friend and we both had a preconceived notion that anything in 3D was going to be horrible, especially when you wear glasses it's a pain to wear another pair on top, but Scorsese made the film so much worthwhile and the 3D was used incredibly. I felt as if I were one of the passengers walking in the Paris train station and if I reached my hand out I could touch the croissants in the corner and talk to Asa Butterfield who plays Hugo. I was less impressed by his acting but the one who stole the show was definitely Chloe Moretz, she plays with the British accent perfectly. Butterfield as Hugo was alright but I didn't really feel his pain or excitement in some scenes, it was quite bland. Moretz was just amazing to watch, I was a huge fan of her in Kick-ass so when I saw her in this movie I was so excited to see such a huge transformation. Scorsese made a great choice in casting her as the female lead. Overall, Hugo is a fun felt movie for the whole family and the set design and effects were a joy to watch in 3D. This is Scorsese's first 3D movie and already it's the best film of the season. Happy Holidays IMDb!",8,2,4,4 December 2011
