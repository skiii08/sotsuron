Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Hats off to Ray Park
","This was good, but I can't help but feel certain parts could have been tweaked to make it great. Many people will complain about Jar Jar Binks. If you don't dwell too much on him, you'll be fine. Everyone will complain about Darth Maul, and they will have a very valid point.  Call it the Boba Fett syndrome;  when a character of mass appeal receives too little screen time.  I enjoyed Episode I, but as with any prequel you know who will survive, thus taking away some suspense (I believe the root of the whole problem). Liam Neeson really had that leader quality down and did a really good job, but you can thank Ray Park (Darth Maul) for the best lightsaber play you are likely to every see. Unfortunately, it is impossible not to have hype around such an anticipated movie, I just wish the media would have cooled it on the spoilers. All in all, the critics were too harsh, and the fans maybe too forgiving. After all this will I see it again?  You bet your Astromech.",Null,0,0,22 May 1999
The Mummy," Entertaining
","This movie was designed to appeal to the masses, a true Hollywood film. You can pick it apart, wince at some of the dialogue, and joke about the character development.  Nevertheless, I sat there with a large soda and enjoyed a nicely paced, action filled, entertaining movie.  The special effects are outstanding (you forget that they are there;  they seem so real) and there are some good chuckles in it too. It's worth the money to get in, and if you feel anxious about full price, go see a matinee.",Null,0,0,15 May 1999
