50 First Dates," Slow easy going movie. Watch it alone, without prejudices.
","Brilliant example of using simple technology to view and live life in true perspective. The movie has a very simple story line yet leaves a powerful message for those who choose to decipher. I found Sandler using video recordings to store memory immensely satisfying. Perhaps we can all selectively store only good memories to help us think with our hearts. In our day to day lives we are accustomed to put all pros and cons on the excel sheet before taking decisions.Slow easy going movie. Watch it alone, without prejudices.Yes its a tearjerker. Also 'Paisa wasool' (worth the money) as they say in India.The lead couple and supporting cast are superb. I loved the movie and Sandler, Dan, Drew, Rob, Sean and easy-going-everybody else.",10,1,2,4 June 2009
