Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Comedic Genius.
","Let's face it. Some of those around you are not very bright.And given the public's ostensible preference for such anti-comedies as 'Dude, Where's My Car,' and 'Big Mama's Barbershop House Party 5,' it's wonderful to see a fiendishly clever movie like this. I just saw the movie tonight, and I can't say that I've laughed that consistently throughout a movie since Monty Python's Holy Grail. Sacha Baron Cohen is brilliant, and I hope he makes a truckload of cash for creating what is one of the most daring and ingenious characters I've seen in a long, long time. Mr. Cohen has precisely what it takes to make great satirical comedy: brains, a self-deprecating sense of humor, and lots and lots of chutzpah. He is exactly what we need right now.If you like Monty Python, or, more recently and more analagously, Christopher Guest's work (This is Spinal Tap, Waiting for Guffman, Best in Show), then Borat is simply a must see. Borat has taken the 'mockumentary' format to wonderfully dizzying heights.Of course, if you are: easily offended, politically correct, not very bright, majored in Gender Studies or Multiculturalism, live in a nursing home, went to publik skool in Alabama, read self-help books, live in Portland or Denver, wear a hair net or name tag to work, practice yoga, take any homeopathic remedies, attend church or synagogue on a weekly basis, live in Kazakhstan or France, celebrate Earth Day, or attend U.C. Berkeley, then you should certainly avoid this movie at all costs. And if you are forced to see it, despite falling into one of the aforementioned categories, then please don't proceed to register your grievous offense in a public forum. You will look like a boorish jackass who deserves a good flogging.",10,6,20,4 November 2006
Saw," If you loved this movie, well, you're retarded.
","The plot started out rather interesting, and I have to say that the camera work, along with much of the editing, was also rather good. But wow, does it go downhill fast. Cary Elwes delivers one of the single worst performances I've ever seen from an actor over the age of 8. Some of his moments are laugh out loud funny, he's so egregiously bad. He should be embarrassed, given all the acting experience he's had. Leigh Whannell, with much less experience, is better, but only marginally. Some of his moments are also laughably bad. Together with a plot that quickly becomes insipid, and dialog that sounds as if it were written by a high school dropout, Saw is a pathetic example of its genre. More than that, the favorable reviews of it here on IMDb are an example of how idiotic the movie watching public has become. I can't believe Danny Glover associated himself with this. He should summarily fire his agent.",4,4,7,21 April 2005
