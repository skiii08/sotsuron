The Blair Witch Project," Sorry we couldn't supply the eye candy most of you are so used to.....
","I think I know why Blair Witch has generated as much negative as positive responses.  It FORCES YOU TO BECOME INVOLVED IN THE MOVIE GOING EXPERIENCE!Wow.  What a concept.  Instead of sitting there like the passive sponges most of us become when going to the movies we are actually expected be become involved.  Take a leap of faith/belief or whatever and delve into this movie.  Without the overpowering F/X and music score most movies rely on to 'scare' you, if you still have an imagination left what is implied becomes a hundred times scarier than anything offered up by Hollywood in the last 30 years.  The hardest thing in movies is to scare you.  Not make you jump out of your seat with 5000 watts of sound blasting at 400 decibels (ever seen the 1999 version of the Haunting?  Event Horizon? - every potentially tense scene is preceeded by dead silence then the Blast).  Wake up people!  Blair Witch is the horror movies we have been needing for a long time and I'm glad someone finally had the guts to make it.",10,513,801,1 December 1999
