Blade Runner 2049," Not very good... At all!
","Nothing like 1982 Bladerunner, 2049 is crap and a sequel not needed. Not even Ryan Gosling could save this turd! Watch Bladerunner 1982 if you want to see a great movie, don't waste your time on this one.",2,4,7,16 May 2019
Blade Runner 2049," Ridley Scott at his best!
","I love this movie, great story, great acting, great characters! Several actors just starting out that went on to be big successes in Hollywood. This and Alien are my favorite Ridley Scott's movies. Both have high repeatable viewing factors. The final cut on the 5 disc Blu-ray collectors edition is the one to watch. This is movie making at its best unfortunately 2049 is crap!",2,1,4,16 May 2019
The Matrix Revolutions," Will grow on you over time!
","I did not like Revolutions when I first saw it! When I bought the trilogy on DVD, I would watch Matrix, and Reloaded and skip Revolutions. Then one day I watched all 3 and suddenly Revolutions started to make sense! It's a deep and dark movie that requires multiple viewings. Well lo n behold it grew on me and now I love Revolutions! There's alot going on in this finale and rightly so! There are some things I didn't like, one being that Morpheus who has been the leader of the resistance all of a sudden is a commander with no ship taking orders from Roland! His character was really minimized here and I believe it was a poor decision altogether! I mean this is Morpheus who found the ONE! I love this trilogy!",9,4,5,22 February 2019
Jurassic World," Major Major Major...
","CRAP!!! Does not even deserve a 1 star! So much hype and this is what we got! Who are these jokers giving this a 10? This movie is nowhere a 7/10 movie, that's a joke!",1,0,1,4 March 2020
Prometheus," Skip this one!
","Stick to the first 2, and if you're like me part 3 as well, it's a guilty pleasure for me, Alien and Aliens are the best movies ever made IMO, Prometheus and Covenant are a joke!",1,4,10,19 November 2019
Halloween," The immortal classic!
","I saw this back when I was in high school and the suspence I felt then is still felt today! Great story, characters, and suspence along with an unforgettable score makes Halloween a movie that just ages like a fine wine. It introduced the shape to the world, a shadow behind the old elm tree, a cold face behind the afternoon glare of a windshield... That's the Shape! Donald Pleasence was perfect for the Loomis character and the part and glad they offered him the part and that he accepted. Debra Hill doesn't get the credit she truly deserves and I believe she was instrumental in making Halloween what it became so kudos to Carpenter for hooking her up as his producer! I want to salute Nick Castle for his legendary performance as the shape, after many sequels, no other character that played the shape even comes close to his performance. Halloween is John Carpenter's industry calling card and will always be synonymous with the boogie man!",9,0,0,5 September 2019
