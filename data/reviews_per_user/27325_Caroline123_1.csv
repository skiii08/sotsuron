Requiem for a Dream," intense
","This was probably one of the most emotional intense films i have ever seen. Although the script was well written i don't think it would have been this intense if it weren't for the film work, the editing and the cameras. the split screen and the noises that were made when they did drugs or when she was sipping on her coffee were so cool. Although i am a big fan of up-beat movie this movie was just so well done from a directors stand-point that it was hard not to like it because it was so depressing. I am so glad they didn't put the deleted seen where they try to stop doing drugs because it just doesn't seem like reality. I really think the Mother should have gotten an award for her performance it was amazing!",8,1,2,24 January 2005
