Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Not as good as the originals but a first rate summer blockbuster nonetheless.
","CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe Phantom Menace was considered by many to be a disappointing start to the Star Wars prequel trilogy, but I have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it.For a start, this is very much a curtain raiser.  It introduces the galaxy we've come to know and love as it existed `before the dark times, before the Empire'.  The slightly overcomplicated plot revolves around the invasion of Queen Amidala's planet Naboo by the greedy Trade Federation.  Jedi Knights Qui Gon Jinn and Obi Wan Kenobi are dispatched to resolve the crisis. Along the way team up with the likes of R2 D2, the much-maligned Jar Jar Binks and mysterious child prodigy Anakin Skywalker, who may or may not be the fulfilment of an ancient Jedi prophecy.  As they investigate further it becomes apparent something far more sinister than the Trade Federation is behind the invasion of Naboo.There were many complaints about The Phantom Menace, but the one overriding criticism was over the character of Jar Jar Binks.  Some found him simply too annoying.  Personally, I didn't.  Odd creatures have always been a part of the Star Wars universe.  His presence in the story is appropriate, and his character helps underline a key Star Wars theme about how everyone is made a certain way for a reason.  In Jar Jar's case the lesson learned is no matter how clumsy you may think you are, you aren't useless.  Ultimately his clumsiness helps win a big battle near the end.Admittedly, it is downright odd after years of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia watching a Star Wars film without them.  One does get the sense of something missing.  I think the most notably, the witty banter from the original films is largely (but not entirely) absent.  Instead we have broad slapstick comedy that, whilst certainly pleasing children, lacks the sophistication of the earlier scripts.On the other hand, the film was criticised for not being dark enough. This is completely unfair as anyone who knows their Star Wars history will tell you that the story gradually gets darker, climaxing in the massacre of the Jedi and the rise of the Empire in Episode III.  At this stage however, all is generally well with the Universe despite corrupt bureaucratic politicians running things and a general sense of unease as one gets the impression of darker forces in the background.The underlying message in The Phantom Menace, particularly if you look at the Senate scenes, is how bureaucracy is a foundation for dictatorship. This is very relevant to contemporary society if one looks at, say, the European Union.  Also, history has proved this to be the case (eg Napoleonic Europe, Nazi Germany, etc).Where The Phantom Menace succeeds brilliantly is in its set pieces.  For instance the pod race and lightsabre duels (with stunningly evil villain Darth Maul) are breathtaking and exhilarating.  The special effects, cinematography, production design, editing, sound and music score (John Williams firing on all cylinders) are all astounding.Acting wise Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor do a good job as the Jedi Knights. Natalie Portman is so-so, and Ian McDiarmid is superb as the future Emperor, an ambitious underhand politician named Palpatine.  Jake Lloyd does a decent job as Anakin, and seeing C3PO and R2 D2 meet for the first time is a sheer delight (`what do you mean my parts are showing?').On the whole, The Phantom Menace sets the scene well for what's coming (`The boy is dangerous, they all sense it, can't you?').  Not as good as the originals but a first rate summer blockbuster nonetheless.",8,1,2,25 July 2003
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The greatest pure adventure film ever made.
","Raiders of the Lost Ark is, in my opinion, not only the finest film in the Indiana Jones trilogy but also the greatest pure adventure film ever made. Better than The Adventures of Robin Hood (with Errol Flynn), Where Eagles Dare, The Mask of Zorro, Romancing the Stone, The Mummy or any James Bond film.  This unadulterated thrill ride first exploded onto the big screen in 1981 and remains unsurpassed, despite many good and not-so-good imitators.Combining the immense talents of George Lucas as writer and producer, and Steven Spielberg as director, this film echoes the great cliffhanger serials of Hollywood yesteryear but also outshines them by a long way.  Set in the 1930s, Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as Indiana Jones.  Jones is essentially a grave robber, a mercenary archaeologist who has hair-raising adventures uncovering rare artefacts.  He gets hired by the US government to uncover the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis, and is propelled into a thrilling globetrotting adventure.  Along the way he is helped by old flame Marion (the superb Karen Allen) and friend Sallah (the equally superb John Rhys Davis).There are really too many great scenes to mention.  From its riveting opening (that boulder scene), to the Nepal bar fight, the Arab swordsman, the map room, the snake pit, the truck chase and the supernatural finale as God's wrath is unleashed, this is as exciting as films get.  Spielberg is firing on all cylinders here and having great fun.  There are also many laugh-out-loud moments.  Where else will you see a monkey perform a Hitler salute?Ultimately, what really makes this film so interesting, is how Indy is just as obsessed with finding the Ark as the villain Belloq (the wonderfully slimy Paul Freeman).  Twice he chooses to abandon Marion because of his obsession.  As Belloq observes `you are a shadowy reflection of me', the clichÃ© for once rings true.  In subsequent Indiana Jones films, he is far a more straightforward hero, here he is a much darker and more interesting character.Needless to say, the special effects, sound, music (the peerless John Williams), production design, editing, cinematography etc are well up to scratch.  It's impossible to find a more rattling good yarn than this film.",10,0,0,30 July 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Spielberg's finest film.
","CONTAINS SPOILERSIt is criminal Steven Spielberg didn't win Oscars for best picture and director for E.T.  This is, in my opinion, not only Spielberg's finest film. It's the best children's film ever made.Of course everyone is now familiar with the story of the abandoned alien befriending the boy Elliot (played brilliantly by Henry Thomas), but what is often overlooked are the darker elements of the story.  For a start, the opening chase in the woods is downright terrifying, as well as deeply traumatic.  The humour and (genuine) sentiment of the story is superbly undercut with the menace of the NASA scientists and the sound of their jangling keys as they approach.  To add to this effect, Spielberg never shows you a man's face until very late in the picture.  Almost every shot is from a child's point of view.  Also, I find the `death' of E.T. one of the most downright upsetting scenes in film history.  Of course this is sheer emotional manipulation, but brilliantly executed.  In the subsequent resurrection scene the audience literally goes from tears to laughter in a matter of seconds.  There are one or two great chase scenes in E.T., most notably near the end when the bikes fly off into the sunset.  That is, in my book, the single most exhilarating scene in cinema history.Performances are all fantastic from an (at the time) largely unknown cast. As well as direction, the screenplay, cinematography, sound, editing and music are all first rate.  In fact John Williams score is the best I've ever heard composed for a film (topping even Star Wars for sheer operatic overtones).  Everyone remembers the soaring main theme but there are many other more subtle pieces which add immeasurable quality.I won't bore you with details of the much-documented Christ allegories in the film, but what is more interesting is its moral message.  Although understated, E.T. is clearly a film about tolerance and not judging by appearance.  That makes it the ideal modern fairy tale.As for the recently re-released version, the new scenes neither add nor subtract from what is already a classic film.  That said, I'd watch the original because of the much-maligned digital removal of guns in the final chase.  For the most part you don't notice, but if you are familiar with the film, the absence of a particular cutaway (and subsequent edit in the music) is jarring.",10,2,4,30 July 2003
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A first rate adventure film.
","Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl is easily the most enjoyable blockbuster film of the silly season for one simple reason: its immensely good fun.
Its a classic tale of adventure on the high seas as blacksmith Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) discovers his true heritage as a pirate. The wonderful, surprise-laden plot is too intricately daft to spoil, suffice to say it rattles from start to finish with cursed medallions, sea battles, hidden islands, secret tunnels, treasure, ghostly scares, sword fights, betrayal, romance, action, adventure and of course pirates (both alive and 'undead').
The whole cast is superb with Orlando Bloom playing the straight hero to Johnny Depp's hilarious and stunningly offbeat pirate Jack Sparrow (or 'Captain' Jack Sparrow as he insists on being known). Kiera Knightly is wonderful as spunky love interest Elizabeth Swann, who gets a lot of the best lines (including some great gags about corsets). Geoffrey Rush makes a splendid villain, and Jonathan Pryce is marvellous as Knightly's cowardly father.
The script is sharp and often hysterically funny ('the pirate code is more like guidelines'). The special effects are stunning, as is the cinematography, which makes beautiful use of widescreen. The music score is appropriately rousing and Gore Verbinski directs the whole thing with a tremendously old fashioned sense of fun which makes this film rank up with the classic Hollywood swashbucklers like Captain Blood.
All in all, a first rate adventure film.",9,0,1,11 August 2003
Spider-Man 2," As good as the first film
","Spider-Man 2 has received the best reviews of any film so far this year. I'm not about to buck that trend; it is indeed a triumph. 
Equal in every way to its predecessor, the movie kicks off with a brilliant title sequence incorporating paintings depicting scenes from the original film.  The story picks up two years after part one with Peter Parker trying to attend college, hold down jobs (from which he keeps getting fired) and be Spiderman all at the same time.  The pressure is really getting to him, and worse, his spider powers seem to be suddenly failing at inopportune moments. Mary-Jane, with whom Peter is still secretly in love with, has become a successful actress and model.  Meanwhile, Harry Osbourn still swears revenge against Spiderman for killing his father (aka the Green Goblin in part one). He has inherited his father's company and is funding the dangerous fusion research of one Dr Octavius.  In the tradition of all movie and comic book scientists, something goes horribly wrong in the experiment, and Octavius finds himself possessed by four AI mechanical arms which take over his mind and turn him into classic Spiderman villain Dr Octopus. The entire cast acquit themselves superbly.  We really care about what happens with not just Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) and Mary Jane (Kirsten Dunst) but everyone else from tormented villain Dr Octopus (Alfred Molina on top form) trying to regain his sanity to Peter's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris), who is about to lose her house because she's behind on mortgage payments. Best of all, Harry Osbourne (the brilliant James Franco) is evolving into a fascinating character; a young man spoilt by riches yet tormented by his dead father from beyond the grave.  His obsession with killing Spider-Man not realising his true identity is brilliantly handled and has a splendid pay-off/set-up for part three. Speaking of sequels, those among you familiar with the comics will spot not one but three characters available to become super villains in future instalments.  The producers are wisely keeping their options open, and if the success of this film is anything to go by, the franchise could run and run. What really sets Spider-Man 2 apart from the usual mindless summer blockbuster fare is its dedication to character and plot.  Director Sam Raimi wisely keeps the human drama at the centre, with the stunning action scenes advancing rather than holding up the plot.  There are several amazing set pieces, particularly one involving a runaway train.  Comedy plays a big part too.  There are many hilarious moments, such as a scene where Parker washes his Spiderman costume in a laundrette.  Another moment with Spiderman in a lift is a hoot.  Skinflint Bugle editor Jameson (JK Simmons) provides loads more laughs here than he did in the first film.  Also, there are amusing in jokes for film buffs and fans of Raimi's earlier horror films (including a very funny Evil Dead reference).  There is even a hilarious and highly effective homage to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. The special effects, needless to say, are amazing.  The film looks bright, vibrant and colourful, and Danny Elfman's dynamic and emotive music score underscores the drama wonderfully. Spider-Man 2 is at its heart a hugely poignant coming-of-age story, as Peter Parker comes to terms with his destiny as a superhero.  I could greatly expound on the endless positive moral and spiritual messages in the film, but I can't be bothered to.  Instead, stop reading this and go and see it!",9,0,0,16 July 2004
Troy," An infuriatingly mixed bag
","CONTAINS SPOILERSWolfgang Peterson's Troy is an infuriatingly mixed bag  by no means the disaster most critics say but not the masterpiece it could have been.Based (somewhat loosely) on Homer's The Illiad, Troy tells of the ten year siege of Troy caused by Prince Paris illicit romance with Helen of Sparta  the face that launched a thousand ships.  And those thousand ships, battles, and numerous special effects certainly please the eye.  But huge battles do not a great film make.  Fortunately, the Illiad is such a superb story it's virtually impossible to mess it up completely.  Most of the cast acquit themselves well, despite mispronouncing certain names.  Brad Pitt makes a fine Achilles, Brian Cox a suitably scheming King Agamemnon, and Orlando Bloom an appropriately cowardly Paris.  However, all are totally outclassed by Peter O'Toole's King Priam, an outstanding performance.  In fact, it made me wish David Lean had directed The Illiad in the 1960's and cast O'Toole as Achilles.  The only actor who even comes close to his brilliance is Eric Bana, who strikes a suitably tragic note as Hector.On the other hand, Diane Kruger does not convince as Helen, and I am forced to agree with Empire magazine  her face might launch a rubber dingy or two, but not a thousand ships.Also, James Horner's music score is rather pedestrian which is hardly surprisingly considering he had very little time to write it.  Apparently some brainless studio executive thought it was a good idea to replace Gabriel Yared's reportedly marvellous original score because it wasn't `thumping enough'.  Why on earth anyone thought it a good idea to eliminate the supernatural elements of the tale I will never know.  Integral to The Illiad are the gods and their petty squabbling, and Achilles, whose identity as a son of the gods is never explained.  Those with no previous knowledge of Greek mythology will be wondering why on earth an arrow in the heel kills him.Overlong, overblown, and ultimately taking itself way too seriously, the film is worth watching for a single brilliant scene where Peter O'Toole begs Brad Pitt for the body of his dead son.  In that moment the film ascends, temporarily, to the level of the great Greek tragedy.",6,118,194,2 June 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Highly exciting and instantly forgettable
","Roland Emmerich's The Day after Tomorrow is a surprisingly enjoyable disaster movie romp.  Global warming and polar ice cap melting cause a cataclysmic sudden change in global climate.  Tornados, tidal waves, and temperatures that plummet ten degrees per second mete out chaos worldwide. This allows for some truly spectacular and breathtaking visual effects.  If this is your cup of tea, then make sure you see it on the biggest screen possible with the best sound systems.  This is a true summer blockbuster  highly exciting, and instantly forgettable.Dennis Quiad is the government scientist saying `I told you so' to a Dick Cheneyesque vice president, but as disaster strikes, he undertakes a personal quest to rescue his teenage son, who is trapped in a frozen over New York.  Plotwise, nothing particularly profound happens, but what is worth noting is the political, rather than meteorological climate this film reflects.For a start, the afore-mentioned vice President's character is clearly a metaphor for the current Bush/Cheney administration who failed to sign the Koyoto accord, infuriating environmentalists and many other politicians worldwide.  The science of the film may be bunk (and who cares for goodness sake), but the message is clearly a wrap on the knuckles for the US, and for the most part, takes a slightly subversive tone.Elsewhere, the satire is painted in broad brushstrokes, such as US refugees illegally crossing the Rio Grande to get into Mexico in an attempt to escape the deadly climate.  Another interesting comparison to make is between the set of `token Brit characters' in Independence Day (another Emmerich epic) and this film.  The former, pre-9/11 Brit characters were barely given a line, much less a personality.  However, since we live in post-9/11 `Brits-are-friends-who-help-us-invade-Middle-Eastern-countries' times, the characters contained herein (played by the likes of Ian Holm) are given more to do, funnier lines, and attempts are made to make you care about them before they obligingly perish in true stiff upper lip style.In the end though, The Day after Tomorrow doesn't have anything terribly profound to say about environmentalism or politics.  It's just big, loud, and all-the better for it.",7,0,0,2 June 2004
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," A superb and fitting finale to the epic Star Wars saga.
","CONTAINS SPOILERSReturn of the Jedi is, in my opinion, a superb and fitting finale to the epic Star Wars saga.Picking up where The Empire Strikes Back left off, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Lando Calrissian, Chewbacca, C3PO and R2 D2 all set off to rescue carbon frozen Han Solo from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt.  Meanwhile, the Emperor and Darth Vader are secretly constructing a new Death Star more powerful than the first, aiming to destroy the Rebel Alliance once and for all.Widely regarded as the weakest of the original trilogy, the criticisms levelled at this film over the years are deeply unfair.  I will now attempt to counter these criticisms one by one.  First, some say the film isn't dark enough and that Han Solo should have been killed off (as apparently he did in an earlier draft).  This would be ludicrous as the film already has enough tragedy to balance the ultimate triumph over the Empire.  Killing Han Solo would have been wrong, plain and simple, especially after all the trouble our heroes go through to rescue him in the first act.  As for the film not being dark enough, the Luke/Vader/Emperor confrontation has some of the most intense and emotionally satisfying drama in any Star Wars film to contrast with the films brighter moments.Secondly, how much one enjoys Return of the Jedi depends on ones stance on Ewoks.  Depending on whom you speak, they are either annoying teddy bears or instrumental in underlining the point of the entire story.  I take the latter view.  The Ewoks symbolise the whole `David and Goliath' aspect of the story - ie the triumph of courage, imagination, and primitive technology over colossal technologically advanced evil.  Leaving that aside, the Ewoks are fun for goodness sake!  The slapstick comedy (such as the logs smashing the Imperial scout walkers) is brilliantly done.  What's more, the Endor battle has just enough of an edge to it to let you know its serious (for instance, there's a small and wonderfully understated moment where an Ewok mourns a dead friend killed by laser fire).The space battles remain the best ever put on film.  The Death Star battle in A New Hope remains better dramatically, but effects-wise these are better.  Considering it was all done with models and opticals they are nothing less than a staggering achievement.  Also, the speeder bike chase (making great use of bluescreen) remains as exhilarating as ever.  Compare it with, say, the chase through the city in Judge Dredd and it becomes clear this has never been equalled, even 20 years later.The performances are all solid (if unremarkable).  There are some lazy moments, such as the bridge scene where Luke tells Leia her true identity. Really that scene should have been played far more dramatically.  The film makes up for it instantly though, by following with a brilliant scene with Vader and Luke where Luke tells Vader `his father is truly dead'.  In that moment where Vader is left alone with his thoughts, you just know the turmoil going on inside of him, despite the mask.In fact, Darth Vader (voiced superbly by James Earl Jones) emerges as the best character.  (SPOILER WARNING AHEAD) - His ultimate redemption as he turns the tables on the Emperor remain as unexpected and exhilarating as ever.  This is, unquestionably, the most powerful and moving moment in the entire saga - especially in the poignant and wonderfully understated final scene between Luke and Vader (`just once let me look on you with my own eyes.').The 1997 special edition is actually my preferred version of the film, as it expands on the galaxy wide celebrations at the fall of the Empire, instead of reducing it to an Ewok night on the town.  The music has also been changed here to something more appropriate.  Instead of moving from Vader's melancholic funeral pyre right into the Ewok bash, the audience sees many other planets celebrate, including the Imperial capital Coruscant where the Emperor's statue is torn down.All in all, a brilliant ending and well worth 10/10 (take two points off if you don't like Ewoks).",10,0,0,25 July 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," A dynamic, epic, beautiful and sweeping work that knocks the socks of anything in the fantasy genre since Star Wars
","CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSJRR Tolkien's staggering trilogy The Lord of the Rings is my favourite novel of all time.  To call it the literary equivalent of the (original) Star Wars trilogy if anything undersells it, as much of Star Wars is inspired by it. When I heard Peter Jackson was going to make films of my `precious' books I was nervous to say the least.  How could he possibly succeed?Then, in December 2001, I breathed an immense sigh of relief combined with an almighty gasp of delighted surprise.  The first film in the trilogy not only lived up to expectations, it surpassed them.  If anything, the film was better than the book.  I say this simply because cinema is my preferred artistic medium.  What Peter Jackson did was not merely film the book (as was the case with the first two Harry Potter films) but instead translated it into cinema.  Jackson emphasised what was cinematically potent, reinvented a number of sequences and trimmed a few others with the apparent motto `show don't tell', which is of course what great cinema does.The resultant adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is an unmitigated masterpiece.  A dynamic, epic, beautiful and sweeping work that knocks the socks of anything in the fantasy genre since Star Wars in 1977.  It is nothing less than criminal that it didn't win the Oscar for best picture.The deceptively simple plot can be summed up in one phrase: `evil ring must be destroyed'.  For this to happen, representatives of all races in Middle Earth - Humans, Hobbits, Elves, Dwarfs etc - must unite against the forces of evil led by the Dark Lord Sauron who wants to regain the great Ring to rule and cover all the world in darkness.The complicated backstory is brilliantly rendered in a splendid prologue outlining the history of the Ring and how it came to be in the hands of the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins.  Bilbo's nephew, Frodo, takes up the quest to destroy the Ring with the help of wizard Gandalf and a fellowship representing the other races in Middle Earth.The ensuing adventure is so full of excitement, adventure, humour, irony, melancholy, terror and tragedy that it really is impossible to describe the emotions of the story in a few words.  Although the plot deals specifically with the timeless theme of good versus evil, it also encompasses complex issues such as immortality, temptation, and growing up.  There have been several misguided attempts at pinning Tolkien's work down in allegorical terms, most recently to the post September 11th war against terrorism.  To do this is to miss the point.  Tolkien himself claimed his work was neither allegorical or topical.  It was instead intended to be a `fake history' or mythology for England and Europe, rooted deeply in his Christian beliefs.The casting in the film is impeccable.  Sir Ian McKellen simply is Gandalf, Elijah Wood excels as Frodo, Viggo Mortensen is superbly rugged as hushed-up-King Aragorn, Ian Holm makes a tragic and moving Bilbo, Sean Bean is wonderful as Boromir - a man gradually seduced by the evil of the Ring, and Christopher Lee is great as turncoat wizard Saruman to name just a few.The cinematography is staggeringly beautiful, making great use of breathtaking New Zealand locations.  The special effects and production design are groundbreaking.  Editing and sound are both first-rate.
Finally, Howard Shore's magnificent music score deserves a special mention, the best I've heard of its type this side of Star Wars.  Not only does he manage to create a sweeping work similar to a full-blown opera, but he manages to incorporate Elvish poems and songs that were an frequent feature of the novel unable to be included elsewhere.The extended edition of the film is an interesting alternative edit, with new bits and pieces which are all good (especially for fans of the book), but to be honest it doesn't matter which version you see.  The film's staggering attention to detail, its unswerving conviction and its brisk pace (not a duff moment in its entire running time) make this quite simply one third of the greatest fantasy film ever made.",10,8,9,25 July 2003
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Surprisingly enjoyable.
","The Terminator and Terminator 2:Judgment Day are, respectively, a science fiction classic, and a worthy sequel to a science fiction classic.  They are both brilliantly written and directed by James Cameron, the finest action director in the world.  As well as being excellent action-packed stories, they have great emotional impact and contain an interesting message about the value of human life.  They also manage to be simultaneously pessimistic and optimistic as the heroes of the story struggle to prevent a future apocalypse.  Whether or not they succeed is left brilliantly ambiguous. 
The close of Terminator 2 seemed like a fantastic ending.  Continuing it, I always thought would be a truly terrible idea, especially with James Cameron not at the helm.  Therefore, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines sounded like a cynical exercise in revitalising Arnold Schwarzenegger's flagging career. Unlike the first two films, it has not been made for any artistic or creative reason.It comes as a great surprise then, that Terminator 3 is actually rather enjoyable.  It's nowhere near as good as its illustrious predecessors, but its certainly more entertaining than, say, The Matrix Reloaded.  Although director Jonathan Mostow lack's Cameron's flair, he's always solid and delivers some fine action set pieces.  Unfortunately, that's all he does deliver.  Terminator 3 is full of action, but it has precious little character development and lacks the emotional core of the earlier films. That is, until the last five minutes of the film which I won't spoil here.The plot is the same as ever, with Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 terminator once more sent back in time to protect John Conner (Nick Stahl) from yet another terminator upgrade, the female T-X (Kristanna Loken).  The T-X is a kind of cross between the liquid metal terminator of Terminator 2 and Arnie's mechanical version.  However, this time it has other targets beside Conner, including his wife-to-be Kathryn Brewster (Claire Danes).  It transpires the nuclear war Conner thought had been prevented in Terminator 2 has only been `postponed' (completely destroying the logic of previous instalments).  This leads to a race against time, which fails to be anywhere near as suspenseful as it should be.The cast are all good, if unremarkable.  However, the script has an annoying habit of delivering the signature dialogue with a nod and a wink.  Lines like `Come with me if you want to live' and `I'll be back' no longer have the resonance they had in the earlier films, and simply become irritating. As for Arnie, he's good, but no longer has the edge he had in the earlier films.  I doubt this film will resurrect his career.",6,0,0,4 August 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Not as good as the book
","Widely considered the best book in the series, Harry Potter part three is cracking read.  A darker addition to the Potter canon, it deals with the escape of murderer Sirius Black from Azkaban (not a middle eastern country but a wizard prison).  Apparently responsible for betraying Harry's parents to Lord Voldemort, Black is now after Harry too.  His friends and teachers all want to protect him, but Harry has something else on his mind: revenge.It's therefore a great shame to report that this instalment, despite a visual makeover, a new director, and better performances from the lead actors, remains depressingly pedestrian in comparison to the novel.  All the keystone events of the book are present, yet the screenplay shows undue reverence to the source material, again forgetting the adage `Show, don't tell'.  For example, just as the first film ought to have opened with the murder of Harry's parents, this one ought to have opened with Black's dramatic arrest after his apparent murder of Peter Pettigrew.The Dementors, Ringwraith-like guardians of Azkaban prison, are initially frightening but fail to remain menacing as the film progresses.  Not enough effort is made to make us afraid of Black.  Key moments of emotional weight from the book are skimmed over, especially in the finale.  The performances are OK, especially from Daniel Radcliffe who has improved tremendously, and Gary Oldman is well cast as Sirius Black, but one expects better from Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman.  The only really memorable turn comes from David Thewlis' Professor Lupin.On the plus side, John Williams' music score is very good; building nicely on his outstanding score for the first film he contributes some fine new themes here.  Special effects look great too, especially Buckbeak the Hippogriff, a bizarre cross between an eagle and a horse.  The cinematography is fine, with the Glen Coe locations looking very beautiful. And director Alfonso Cuaron gives the whole piece a stylish makeover, clearly taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book.That said, this is not a huge improvement on films one and two, and given the source material should have been far better.  The real problem with the Harry Potter films is they still feel like a franchise following a formula, which is remarkable considering their unpredictable plots.  The old cliché is once again true; it's not as good as the book.",6,0,0,7 June 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," A great continuation of a great story, and a wonderful, heroic epic.
","CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe second film in Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of JRR Tolkien's classic trilogy The Lord of the Rings is every bit as much a triumph as the first. Wisely eschewing the `previously-on-The Lord of the Rings' type nonsense that so often wastes valuable screen time in such works, Jackson literally hurls you straight back into the plot, as Gandalf battles the Balrog in a stunning opening duel.  Some have criticised this lack of a re-cap as being insensitive to those who haven't read the book or seen the first film. However, I've no sympathy for anyone who's not done at least one of those two.  Anyone coming to The Two Towers with no previous knowledge would soon get hopelessly lost in any case.The plot follows threes strands.  First and foremost, it concerns Frodo and Sam's journey to Mordor as they attempt to put and end to the Ring.  They are guided by the Ring's previous owner Gollum, a twisted, demented creature coming across like a schizophrenic drug addict.  In the second plotline, Human Aragorn, Elf Legolas, and Dwarf Gimli search for the other Hobbits captured by Uruk-Hai in the previous installment.  Along the way they enter the land of Rohan and help its beleaguered King Theoden fight Saruman's evil army of Uruk-Hai.  The third plot strand follows the plight of Hobbits Pippin and Merry (whom Aragorn and his companions seek) as they escape the Uruk-Hai and befriend the mysterious Ent Treebeard, a walking talking tree.Given the extreme difficulty in adapting The Two Towers as a film, Peter Jackson has done an incredible job creating a coherent film.  He wisely opted to end the film short of where the book ends (the latter chapters of the book will take place in the third film).  Certain elements of the book he has tweaked (most notably the character of Faramir, Boromir's brother) to, in my opinion, good effect.Performance wise, the high standard set by the first film continues.  All the characters from the first film are just as good, if not better here. New characters Theoden (the splendid Bernard Hill), Eowyn (Mirando Otto) and Faramir (David Wenham) are all brilliantly brought to live.  Worthy of special mention is the fantastic rendering of Gollum, without doubt the best CGI character ever created.The special effects continue to stun.  I always thought the army of Ents storming Isengard would be impossible to put on film - I was wrong.  Also, the battle of Helms Deep is a triumph - a stunning battle which more than lives up to its counterpart in the book.  The production design, editing, sound and cinematography are as impressive as ever.Howard Shore's score is nothing less than a work of genius in its own right. From the heroic Rohan theme to the melancholic and haunting Gollum's song, this is an unparalleled work.  Less immediately showy than Fellowship's themes (some of which are briefly reprised here) this ultimately gets under one's skin more than the music of the first film (no mean feat).All in all, this is another triumph.  Darker and more action packed than its predecessor, The Two Towers is a great continuation of a great story, and a wonderful, heroic epic.  It's weighty themes of immortality, betrayal, genocide, temptation and sacrifice and nicely balanced by a great sense of humour that runs throughout.  Gimli provides a lot of laughs, and one line by Treebeard (surprisingly not in Tolkien's book) offers a wonderfully bizarre but true observation - `I always like going south.  Somehow it feels like going downhill.'  Quite.",10,0,0,25 July 2003
The Incredibles," Brad Bird is the Steven Spielberg of animation
","Brad Bird directed my all-time-favourite animated feature The Iron Giant; one of the most criminally underrated films ever. So for me expectation was extremely high for this, his second feature. Opting for computer animation over hand drawings and working with Pixar studios for the first time, I wondered if he could repeat the magic. He has. As far as I'm concerned, Brad Bird is now the Steven Spielberg of animation. It may be premature to say this after one viewing, but I think its Pixar's greatest picture to date, better even than Toy Story 2.The story is far too good to spoil but I will reveal this much. Superheroes have become outlawed through a series of lawsuits. Mr Incredible and his superhero wife Elastigirl had to enter a witness protection programme to hide their secret identities. Mr Incredible now holds down a boring office job in an insurance company and has three children, all of whom have powers but are forbidden to use them. Suffice to say this leads to a hilarious and poignant home life full of domestic difficulties and Mr Incredible begins to long for the good old days of superhero exploits.The bittersweet early scenes soon give way to a full-on action adventure, and this is the point where I redundantly mention how staggering the animation is, because no amount of description can do it justice. It is beautifully rendered making tremendous use of widescreen space. The witty, sophisticated screenplay has an informed knowledge of comic book lore without once resorting to the cheap, self conscious spoof so common in similar works. Instead, it has the courage to play it fairly straight, which gives the story great emotional resonance. That's not to say it isn't funny. It's frequently hilarious; one inspired gag involving capes is especially amusing and a vocal cameo from Brad Bird himself as a luvvie fashion designer is guaranteed to bring the house down. The most knowing line comes from the villain, who having captured Mr Incredible starts explaining his master plan before realising what he's doing: 'I can't believe you've got me monologuing!'One of Bird's favourite films is obviously the 1950's version of The War of the Worlds, as both The Iron Giant and The Incredibles feature huge robots which are an obvious homage to said film. It also has the coolest 'baddies base' I've ever seen, even outstripping You Only Live Twice. Speaking of James Bond, Michael Giacchino's John Barryesque music score is outstanding, and very reminiscent of the classic 1960's Bond films. The vocal talents are all excellent; Craig T Nelson as Mr Incredible, Holly Hunter as Elastigirl and especially Samuel L Jackson as friend of the family superhero Frozone. Even the end credits are wonderfully stylish. Above all, this is one film that must be seen on a big screen. Even the most 'stay-at-home-and-wait-for-the-video' among you should make an exception (you know who you are!).Some critics have carped that the mega-action climax is overkill and that the film is too long. Personally, I thought the finale appropriately loud and exciting and whilst it is longer than normal (120 minutes is unusual for a cartoon feature), it never outstays its welcome. In short, this is the best animated film of the year, the best family film of the year and the most out and out fun film of the year.Oh, and for those poor unfortunates among you who haven't seen The Iron Giant yet, buy or rent the DVD and watch that too!",Null,0,0,23 November 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," A welcome antidote to the annual deluge of rubbish romantic comedies
","Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet star in this bizarre love story which is more or less told in reverse.  Imagine a rather surreal love story version of Memento you'll get the idea.  After Joel (Carrey) and Clementine (Winslet) have an unsuccessful romance, they decide to undergo a radical medical procedure to erase each other from their memories.  However, as Joel has the process done, he finds he wants to keep some of his memories after all, and tries to hide them at deep subconscious levels.For every person I've met who liked this film I met someone who hated it.  I belong in the former category.  Charlie Kaufman's screenplay is amusing, melancholic and clever.  Michel Gondry directs with flair, and Carrey is as good here as he was in The Truman Show, playing against type.  There is also fine support from Winslet, Kirstin Dunst and Tom Wilkinson who is at the centre of an unexpected and interesting subplot I won't spoil here.The only thing I didn't like was the regulation f-ing and blinding which despite being realistic, somewhat soured it for me.  That said, this is recommended for anyone on the lookout for something a little different, and a welcome antidote to the annual deluge of rubbish romantic comedies with neither romance nor comedy.",8,0,1,6 May 2004
The Matrix Reloaded," A major disappointment.
","CONTAINS SPOILERSFrankly, a better title for this film might be `The Matrix Rehashed' or `The Matrix Regurgitated'.  That's not to say it's terrible, but it is a major disappointment.  Clearly, the Warshowski Brothers are immensely talented writers/directors, but here they seemed to have bowed to studio pressure to make the same film again only bigger, louder and with far less freshness.I was never a huge fan of The Matrix.  I enjoyed it but I have never thought it the classic so many claim it is.  I won't waste time reprising my criticisms of that film, instead, to the matter at hand.To begin with, the special effects, as they seem to be the chief selling point of the film it seems only fair I comment on them first.  In the original film, at least the groundbreaking effects were not overused.  Not so in The Matrix Reloaded.  Everything about this film screams `Look what I can do!'  Its most serious problem can be summed up in one word: overkill. Where the flo-mo shots were used to good effect in the first film, this one has so many that the effect is tedious and repetitive despite being visually stunning.So how is the Matrix reloaded?  Do those dastardly machines simply press CTRL/ALT/DELETE and start their computer again?  No, instead they send those funny squid things to drill towards the subterranean city of Zion and kill every human there.  The only hope is for the now superhuman Neo to re-enter the Matrix on a race against the clock mission.  But Neo is disturbed by recurring dreams of the death of his lover, Trinity and is struggling to come to terms with his super powers (like you do).  Logic takes a back seat here, for instance, why does Neo bother to fight 100 cloned Agent Smiths when he could simply fly away (as he does moments later, presumably once he's bored).  The plot set-up also feels somewhat clumsy, with clunky dialogue plus a gratuitous and totally unnecessary sex scene, which does not advance the plot one iota.  Admittedly, things take a turn for the better in the final third.  But as Neo meets the `Architect' of the Matrix at the climax, I must say I was expecting to see Bill Gates.  To be honest the only scenes really advancing the story came right at the end.  The film ends on a cliffhanger and, if you can be bothered to sit through the endless credits, there's a short trailer for film three afterwards.  I have much higher expectations for the third instalment, as it appears to be a much more interesting and logical progression of the story.Performances are all fairly good if a little flat.  Despite Keanu Reeves limited emotional range he does pretty well as the `Chosen One', Neo, despite the fact his character really has no where else to go after film one.  Carrie Anne Moss as Trinity is as good here as she was in the first film.  Lawrence Fishburne's Morpheus one the other hand is sorely under-used, and that is a shame as his character was such an essential part of the first film.  Here he seems to simply be around to spout the obligatory pretentious cod philosophy.  Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith's return is welcome, but this time his presence seems more comical than menacing. He simply isn't the splendid villain he was previously.  There are a smattering of vaguely interesting new cast members, such as Morpheus' old flame Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), and `The Twins' (kind of `upgraded' agents in the Matrix played by twins Adrian and Neil Rayment).Irritatingly, The Matrix Reloaded continues the first film's penchant for using contemporary music, which will date the films very quickly.  Why on earth the Warshowski Brothers feel the need to include the likes of Marilyn Manson I will never understand.All in all, this film has some admittedly incredible action scenes (such as the freeway chase which echoes Terminator 2), but does very little in the way of advancing character or plot.  At least the original had a good story. Also, its predilection for annoying Zen/Budhist/New Age `wisdom' goes some way to destroying the at least vaguely Christian worldview set up by the original film and therefore, by trying to be all things to all religions, any allegorical message is completely lost.If all you look for in a film is relentless action, incredible special effects with little logic, less character, and no soul then this film is for you.  Otherwise, go and see X-Men 2 instead - a nicely unpretentious summer blockbuster containing plenty of action combined with a decent story, emotional complexity, and a modicum of thought.",4,0,0,25 July 2003
Identity," A well directed mess.
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADJames Mangold's horror thriller is a curious hybrid of Agatha Christie, Stephen King and Alfred Hitchcock.  Frankly, as a film it's a mess.  Its very nicely directed, with competent if thankless performances from the likes of Ray Liotta, Alfred Molina, and John Cusack (always great value) but despite some sharp dialogue, the script goes walkabout halfway through the film.Initially the story is cliched but well executed, with ten apparently unconnected characters forced to spend a night in a Motel cut off from the outside world during a thunderstorm.  They are then promptly bumped off one by one.  Red herrings fly thick and fast as they try to guess which of them is the killer.  However, at this point a Norman-Batesesque twist has the effect of making you cease to care for any of the characters.  Other twists follow in a convoluted and rushed final act which pulls the rug out from under the audience at least two times too many.Therefore on balance, this is worth a look for devotees of the genre, but others beware.",4,1,4,31 July 2003
X2: X-Men United," A fine slice of summer blockbuster excitement.
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEAD:The Marvel X Men comics deal with a group of mutant humans with extraordinary powers who have started appearing on Earth through some apparent evolutionary leap.  Some of them (led by Professor Xavier) want to work with the rest of mankind towards a better future, and some (led by the evil Magneto) want to destroy it.  Broadly speaking, the X Men comics can be taken as an allegory about whatever minority group one happens to sympathise with.The first X Men film was good, but felt distinctly like a warm-up, and that the real story was yet to come.  Sure enough, in X-Men 2 we have a sequel that in almost every way outdoes its predecessor.  It seems George Lucas set a template of how to do a good sequel with The Empire Strikes Back and sure enough, this film follows that kind of formula very well (ie its funnier, darker, more complex and has a surprise downbeat ending setting up a third film).The plot is interesting and unexpected.  Xavier's X Men are forced to form an uneasy alliance with Magneto against an evil US general named Stryker. For reasons of his own, Stryker is conspiring to start a war between mutants and the rest of mankind.  During the alliance, Magneto exerts a corrupting influence, which threatens to turn some of the X Men to his side.  Almost all the X Men from the previous film are back and have significant parts to play, and there are new additions to the cast with the likes of Pyro and Nightcrawler (who thankfully retains the Christianity so essential to his character in the comics).  However, once again Wolverine is the main focus, as he discovers Stryker holds the key to his dark past.Performances are all good (as ever, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart take top prize).  The special effects and action scenes are all good too, particularly in some of the `smaller' moments (eg Magneto's escape from prison).  Better still, it has a decent music score this time (John Ottman). The screenplay is very good (based on a story from the comics) and its brilliantly directed by Bryan Singer.If I had to pick nits, I'd say the tornados in one particular scene looked a little ropey.  That said, there is much to praise in X Men 2 and it is a fine slice of summer blockbuster excitement.",9,0,0,31 July 2003
The Matrix," One of the most over praised blockbusters of recent years.
","CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSThe Matrix is essentially a cross between The Truman Show and The Terminator, and it's not as good as either.  It lacks the topicality of the former, the excitement of the latter and the emotional impact of both. Frankly, I think it is one of the most over praised blockbusters of recent years.In all fairness, it's still a very enjoyable film.  The basic plot about the world today being a computer generated simulation created by machines who use us as batteries is daft in the extreme, but its put forward with such conviction that one takes it seriously.  Keanu Reeves plays his `chosen-one' type hero role very well, and is ably supported by Lawrence Fishburne among others.  And of course Hugo Weaving's Agent Smith makes a cracking villain. The Warshowski brothers both write and direct stylishly, and visually at least, the film has been hugely influential.My problem with the film is not with the overall plot or special effects, which are indeed tremendous (thankfully that flo-mo shot is used sparingly so it doesn't become too gimmicky).  A number of other factors prevent the film from being truly great.  First, the use of music.  Although the main score works fairly well, I question using of the likes of Marilyn Manson to punctuate the soundtrack.  A lot of this contemporary music will date the film very quickly.  More seriously, the mid section is saggy.  Specifically, I would have cut three scenes.  First, the scene with that annoying spoon bending kid (who sounds disturbingly like the `Simon Fisher' character from one of Alan Partridge's radio 4 chatshows) and the subsequent reference to that scene.  Second, the bit where Neo is told he can be `set up' with the woman in the red dress, as I feel it is out of keeping with the spiritual tone of the rest of the film.  Thirdly and most crucially, I would have cut the `ignorance is bliss' scene where Cypher arranges with Agent Smith to betray the others.  There is no information in that scene you don't find out later, and the plot would have been better had the betrayal come as a surprise.However, my final problem with the film is the casual way the heroes consider it perfectly acceptable to kill innocent people in the Matrix.  I know the film tries to paper over this by saying until they are rescued they have to be considered the enemy but frankly it doesn't wash.  This is particularly disturbing in the sequence where Neo guns down umpteen security guards.  This scene was, of course, notoriously linked to the Columbine murders (not that I think it had anything to do with it).That said, I'm still giving the film a high rating.  The first act is genuinely intriguing and the third act is never less than exhilarating.",7,0,1,30 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A heroic dynamic rush of pure adrenaline.
","CONTAINS POSSIBLE SPOILERSWhat can be said about Star Wars that hasn't already been said elsewhere?
For a start, on its arrival in 1977, it was light years ahead of its time. It is a film from which cinema history can literally be divided into two epochs, kind of like BC and AD.  Pre-Star Wars cinema was a very different medium.  Post Star Wars, studios became ever more reliant on big blockbusters to remain afloat.  This has led to some truly brain dead films and, as Peter Bogdanovitch described the `juvenilisation' of cinema.  The success of Star Wars was a two-edged sword.  Its fair to say without it there would have been no Alien, Raiders of the Lost Ark, ET, Terminator, Jurassic Park, Matrix and Lord of the Rings films.  On the other hand there would also have been no Judge Dredd, Lost in Space, Planet of the Apes remake and other assorted drivel that turns up every summer clogging up the multiplexes.Star Wars (or if you're going to be a purist, Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope although the subtitle was only added in the 1981 reissue) thankfully, belongs firmly in the former category.  If its legacy means we have to suffer second rate imitators from time to time, I believe it's a small price to pay for such a magnificent film.  Star Wars is an unmitigated thrill ride - a heroic, dynamic rush of pure adrenaline that has been known to make grown adults degenerate into thrill-happy eight year olds.As I have argued many times, Star Wars is not science fiction in the purest sense of the word.  It is much better described by writer/director George Lucas as `space fantasy'.  It borrows elements from fairy tales ranging from The Wizard of Oz to The Lord of the Rings.  It also is very derivative of classic westerns (such as The Searchers) as well as Samurai films like Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress.  What George Lucas did was take these elements and stick them in outer space in a way no one had done since the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s.  He then threw in the most groundbreaking special effects revolution of all time and this is what he ended up with.The story is comparatively simple.  Young farm boy Luke Skywalker lives with his boring Uncle and Aunt on the desert planet Tatooine longing to follow in his dead father's heroic footsteps.  He gets the opportunity when two droids show up carrying a message from a Princess who has been imprisoned by the evil Darth Vader.  Luke teams up with space pirate Han Solo, his `walking carpet' sidekick Chewbacca, and his mentor Ben Kenobi (who is a former Jedi knight guided by the mysterious `Force') to rescue her.The much-maligned acting of Mark Hamill as Luke is actually often so bad its good, particularly in the Death Star scenes.  He makes a very appealing naÃ¯ve hero.  Harrison Ford's career was launched on the back of his performance as dashing rogue Han Solo, and Carrie Fisher's witty performance as Princess Leia portrays her as anything but a damsel in distress. Elsewhere the droids C3PO and R2 D2 provide superb comic relief.  The banter between all the heroes is extremely funny, a factor largely (but not entirely) lacking from the current, more sombre prequels.  Gravitas is added with the scenes between Ben Kenobi (the superb Alec Guinness) and the mysterious and evil Darth Vader (wonderfully voiced by James Earl Jones). Vader is, in my opinion, the single best screen villain in cinema history. His frightening and dark presence (helped by his menacing breathing and mask) gave children everywhere nightmares.  Vader's character is not developed a huge amount in this film, but in the subsequent installments he proves the most interesting character in the entire Star Wars saga.  The other villain worthy of special mention is Peter Cushings' brilliantly nasty Grand Moff Tarkin, the arrogant governor of the Death Star.The special effects, as I've already mentioned, were light years ahead of their time in 1977.  In my opinion nothing equalled Star Wars effects wise until 1993's Jurassic Park.  Even now, the effects still look fantastic. From the unforgettable opening shot to the final exhilarating space battle, the film is a triumph.  The Death Star battle remains the best space dogfight ever put on film.  Even though we've all seen it hundreds of times, as the pilots are picked off one by one until only Luke remains we get closer and closer to the edge of our seats.  As, the odds are piled up against our hero, Han Solo's last minute intervention and Luke's triumph is, in my opinion, the second most exhilarating scene in cinema history (after the flying bike scene in ET).The production design, costumes and look of the film are terrific (with Imperial greys, whites and blacks contrasting nicely to our more colourful heroes).  The outfits spawned  millions of nerds wanting to buy full Stormtrooper regalia for ludicrous prices.  Also, the editing and ground breaking sound effects are all nothing short of landmark cinema (eg, the breathless space battles and the lightsabres respectively).  Also, John Williams' thundering music score is magnificent.  The staggeringly epic main theme, the Luke Skywalker theme, the Leia theme and many others have all become touchstones for other composers to imitate.The special edition released in 1997 made some changes to effects shots (which were OK changes on the whole) and added a new, unnecessary scene with Jabba the Hutt.  Nevertheless, it doesn't really matter which version you see, the effect is the same.The spiritual overtones in Star Wars are fascinating.  From the Christ allegory of Kenobi to Luke's choosing to have faith in `the Force' rather than trust his computer, this film is chock full of interesting interpretations about God, the Universe, and the triumph of faith, love and courage over faceless technology.  Star Wars is a reassuring film.  That more than anything I believe accounts for its success.  People may be cynical, but underneath they desperately want to believe in absolute good and absolute evil.That's why it's as timeless today as it was in 1977.",10,7,11,25 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," An unmitigated masterpiece
","CONTAINS SPOILERSThe general consensus among fans and critics says The Empire Strikes Back is the finest Star Wars film.  I would have to agree.  It's darker, funnier and more dramatic than the first film.  Although not a sequel in the strictest sense of the word, it belongs to an elite club of `even-better-than-the-original' films along with The Godfather part II and Toy Story 2.The Empire Strikes Back in the hands of studio bosses would probably have been a straight rehash of the original.  Thankfully, George Lucas had complete financial and creative control, bringing in director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett (who died before the film was finished) to help realise his vision.  These collaborators deserve as much credit as Lucas himself for the unmitigated masterpiece that resulted.The Empire Strikes Back picks up the story again as the Rebel Alliance are hiding from the evil Empire on snow planet Hoth.  Here we are re-introduced to our heroes Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and droids C3PO and R2 D2.  Luke is attacked by a snow monster (a kind of abominable snowman called the `Hoth Wampa').  He defeats the creature but is lost in the icy night and begins to freeze to death.  In his delirium, Luke sees a vision of his dead mentor Obi Wan Kenobi instructing him to find Jedi Master Yoda and train as a Jedi.At the same time, romance is brewing between Han Solo and Princess Leia, although they both refuse to admit it.  Han intends to leave Hoth with co-pilot Chewbacca and pay off his debt to Jabba the Hutt before his bounty hunters catch up with him.  However, Han's departure is delayed by rescuing Luke.Unfortunately, It doesn't take long for the Empire, under the leadership of Darth Vader to find the Rebels.  Vader has suddenly become obsessed with tracking down Luke Skywalker and turning him to the dark side of the Force. The Rebels are attacked (in a brilliant battle sequence with huge walking machines called AT ATs) and our heroes take separate paths for the remainder of the film.  Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C3PO flee Imperial forces through space, and Luke seeks Jedi Master Yoda to be instructed in the Force and become a Jedi.Several things about this film are superior to any other film in the Star Wars canon.  For a start, the acting is never better than here (largely thanks to Kershner).  Even Mark Hamill is good and the romantic banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is brilliantly performed, recalling the classic Hollywood screwball comedies of the 1930s and 40s (`Would it help if I got out and pushed?')  There are some great new characters, such as Yoda (Frank Oz), the best puppet character in film history with the possible exception of ET, and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), a double-dealing rogue from Han's past.  Despite having very little screen time, bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Buloch), became a favourite among fans, and we even get our first glimpse of the evil Emperor (played here by Clive Revill, not Ian McDiarmid).The planets visited are more interesting than in any of the other films. Cloud city is wonderful (especially the carbon freeze chamber), Dagobah is an appropriately gloomy swamp, and the Hoth wastelands are spectacular. The production design is absolutely first rate.  Also, John Williams music is at its best here, with fantastic new themes including one for Yoda, a great love theme, and the stunning Imperial march (or Darth Vader theme).Needless to say, the editing, cinematography, sound and special effects are all wonderful (particularly in the asteroid chase).  The witty screenplay never wastes a second and is full understated emotion, particularly in the tearful climax to Han and Leia's romance.  Is this really the end of Han Solo?  In 1980 audiences had to wait three painful years to find out.  Now thankfully, we can simply pull out our VHS of Return of the Jedi.  By the way, this one also has the best lightsabre duel in the entire saga.Which brings us to the ending.  The greatest thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how the plot is propelled, by a brilliant and now legendary twist, to its downbeat conclusion.  The dark ending is crucial because it creates a huge sense of uncertainty for the final film.  Will good really triumph over evil?  This story is great because it's more complex than just good versus bad.  Luke not only has to overcome the evil Empire but the evil in himself. It's about resisting temptation, even to the potential cost of ones life.Whatever George Lucas does with Episode III, nothing for me will ever top this truly magnificent film.",10,1,2,25 July 2003
