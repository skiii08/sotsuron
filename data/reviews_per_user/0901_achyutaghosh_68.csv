Moneyball," Moving, beyond numbers
","'It's hard not to be romantic about baseball. This kind of thing, it's fun for the fans. It sells tickets and hot dogs'Moneyball is a sports movie what makes it stand apart from the crowd is that it takes all the clichés that are associated with sports movies such as heroic games, emotional moments and motivational speeches and turns them down on their head to deliver a movie that delves in the cold and calculative science behind sports- in this case being sabermetrics. Sabermetrics is the specialized analysis of baseball through objective, empirical evidence, specifically baseball statistics that measure in- game activity. Thus it is all about objective knowledge related to baseball, It points out facts such as which player has the highest onbase percentages rather than subjective arguments such as who is the best player in the game.Picture this- in a conference room at the Oakland athletics headquarters, baseball scouts and team management are squabbling to pick stars for their team. And while evaluating prospective players, phrases that go around are-'clean cut, good face, good jaw', 'he is a good looking ball player', and my favourite 'when he hits the ball, it pops off his bat. You can hear it all over the ballpark. There is a lot of pop'. It is then that a manifestation dawns upon Billy Beane - that the current technique of player selection is flawed and unsuitable for teams with smaller budgets. When he stumbles across Peter Brand, a fresh out of Yale statistician, he realizes that he may have found a more cost effective way to get the right players in the team and do battle with the 800 pound gorillas in the league. Using statistics he finds value in players that no one else seem to do. People are overlooked for a variety of biased reasons and perceived flaws- Age, appearance, personality. Mathematics cut straight through that, and Billy, is able to create a championship team that they can afford, because everyone else in baseball undervalues them. After initial setbacks, he manages to effect a dramatic turnaround from a written off team to claim, at 20 games in a row, the longest winning streak in the history of the game.'I hate losing more than I even wanna win' says Brad Pitt as he plays a career defining role as Billy Beane, a reclusive general manager for the Oakland A's who when young promised much as a player, but turned out mediocre. Having taken up scouting, and later a managerial role in a team riddled with middling performers and a tight budget, he is so intense that he does not go to watch his team play, yet he is able to make himself look indifferent as he says that making relations with players will soften him up when he has to make tough decisions about who to keep on the roster and who not to. He finds losing repulsive, yet that seems to be his fate unless he is able to embrace the principles advocated by Peter, played by the usually fat king of vulgarity- Jonah Hill. And what a revelation Hill is in this movie- he is precocious, understated and nerdy to Pitt's charismatic, yet in his quietly confident and softspoken way, he matches him in every scene, proves that there is life for him after he 'outgrows' (pardon the pun), teen comedy. Being riled by scouts yet having analyzed tons of players in the league, he is able to influence Beane to try out his theories which he believes will bring the team out from the rut that it currently is in. Juxtaposed between them and not quite seeing things the same way, is the bull headed coach of the team, played excellently again by Philip Seymour Hoffman- so much so that he continues to frustrate not only the lead characters, but also the viewer in his obstinacy- you so want to get inside the screen and sock him. Some of the movie's best scenes involve intense discussions, and standoffs between these three characters. The movie is based upon 2003 best-selling book by Michael Lewis, 'Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game'- and while baseball continues to remain the backdrop, the movie touches upon how difficult organizations find it is to change, flattening of hierarchies by the availability of information, and the need for efficiency that capitalism demands. While the strongest element of Moneyball is its script by Aaron Sorkin and Steve Zaillian reminiscent of their work in The Social Network. Its lively, intense and emotional, and yet it has its lighthearted moments. While it is gloomy to know that a computer can do a better job at assembling a successful team than years of collective human experience and emotions, at the end of it, this is a movie in which brain triumphs brawn. It is intelligent, the script witty, fast paced, and with strong elements of drama. Each frame is a work of art and is lovingly shot- whether the action in the games, or the real action, which in this case, is behind the scenes. The end results don't matter, nor does is matter that Billy Beane is still looking for his first league win, what matters is the change that his thoughts managed to bring to a sport riddled with tradition.The movie has already garnered 7 Academy Award nominations including ones for Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill and best movie and script also. It has already won the American Film Institute's movie of the year, and it will win many more for though Moneyball says the game is about money, but the movie is about real people, and this makes for riveting cinema.

The Avengers," The Avengers- Best movie of the year so far. Fans salivate, non fans- prepare to get converted!
","The elders say that two is company, anything more is just a crowd. Avengers shows a big fat middle finger to those learned folks of yore, and in the process easily sets the new benchmark for all epic action extravaganzas! With an ensemble star cast, a fast, witty script, thrilling action sequences, and masterful direction, it is the perfect superhero movie, one which will charm not only the nerdy fans, but also the uninitiated.The Avengers project began over 6 years back, when Marvel first thought of bringing their superhero team on screen, but to give each hero a rightful back story they had to bring out the individual movies first. Each of them were characterized by action, humor and a certain degree of insaneness. The movies generated big bucks at the box office, but i always felt Marvel was holding back something- whether the grandness of plot, or the scale of action. This is what it was saving for, no holding back for the $220 million mother of all actioners, Avengers- 6 superheroes, one mental Norse God, a full scale alien invasion- this one has got it all.The story picks up plot strands from the previous movies- Loki steals the Tesserect, a cube like artifact which is a source of great power, which he plans to use to open a portal through which his alien friends in skullcaps invade Earth. Post credit scenes in the older Marvel movies show that Nick Fury has been preparing for just one such rainy day- where the Earth will be 'hilariously out gunned' and there will be the need for the individual superheroes to come together to fight as a team. To form an unbeatable squad, each superhero gets something to the table- Hulk brings the muscle, Captain America brings strategy, Ironman brings style and technology, Thor brings emotion along with Godlike fury, Hawkeye brings steely sincerity and Black Widow brings smoking-hot sexiness. But before they can take on Loki and his minions, they will have to get over their superhero sized egos and other intra heroic tensions so as to work together in a team. Much of the film's uproarious moments come due to the witty banter of the superheroes. The climactic showdown between the good guys and evil aliens might seem overdrawn and similar to the one in last year's Transformers- dark of the Moon, but is infinitely more enjoyable, each scene a joyous ode to the capabilities of this awesome fighting team, each sequence bettering the previous one. The movie's biggest strength is its star cast- Robert Downey as Ironman, continues from where he left off in Ironman 2- 'billionaire, playboy, genius, philanthropist'- he calls himself, as he lends sarcastic humor to an 'oh so serious' group. Chris Evans as Captain America might wear a ridiculous stars and stripes costume but does what is required with utmost sincerity. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does a decent job in showing angst and turmoil, while Jeremy Renner and Scarlett Johansson as Hawkeye and Black Widow are serviceable as second rate heroes to the A-team. However the scene stealers were Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Hiddleston's Loki. Ruffalo is probably the best Hulk to grace the silver screen, and while Edward Norton and Eric Bana played the role with intensity, Ruffalo plays him with a lot of self deprecating humor. Trust me, with or without pants, the Hulk will keep you in splits, but reserve your wolf whistles for the scene where the Hulk delivers the coup de grace to Loki. Loki's expression immediately after- priceless :) Speaking of whom, the star of the movie IS Loki- a superhero movie is as good or as bad as its villain (think Joker in the dark Knight or Doc Ock in Spiderman 2)- and in Avengers, Hiddleston plays Loki in a manner that man to man, he stands head and shoulders above the heroes. This Loki, like most super villains has a sinister, single point agenda- to rule the world, and in its quest he even manages to make a crowd of people kneel down to him, in of all places, Germany- not-so-long-ago home to one of the biggest megalomaniac in the history of the world. When Loki is captured and held in a glass cell, he gives a little bit of the Hannibal Lecter treatment to Scarlett.You do a far better job if you love what you do, and director Joss Whedon is a certified geek, having written comics in addition to having directed two cult series. The biggest input that Joss Whedon brings, is to create an environment of impending doom without letting the audience get overworked with it- 'hold on', he seems to say, 'the solution is just round the corner'- it helps the movie not to take itself too seriously, unlike the DC Comic adaptations. Avengers is a celebrity jamboree of sorts, and yet Whedon manages to give each star his place, each character, his due Avengers weighs in at 146 minutes, but to his credit, Whedon keeps the pace snappy throughout, whenever things begin to sag, jokes, punchlines, and slam bam action sequences pop up to keep the party going strong. To sum up, Avengers is a superlative effort. Mixing fantasy, science fiction, imagination, colorfully dressed he-men, this is the film Marvel fans have been waiting for ages- they took their time, but they delivered on all counts. This is a no holds barred, effects driven, mass appeal blockbuster par excellence, absurdly entertaining- these 146 minutes felt like an entire summer vacation in Asgard for geeks such as me, and will sure extend its magic to the non fans. There are so many characters, yet it never felt too many, production values are solid, the script engaging, with loads and loads of nonstop action. There are minor flaws, but this is THE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER OF THE YEAR. Geeking out has never been so much fun.",10,6,11,27 April 2012
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Action packed, Intelligent and Entertaining
","Professor Moriaty: Are you sure you want to play this game? Sherlock Holmes: I'm afraid you'd lose.In addition to him being the template for countless detective fiction writers, Sherlock Holmes evokes sweet childhood memories, stirring the colonial spirit in us- of restrained Victorian surroundings, intellectual jaunts by an eccentric yet bohemian detective aided by his faithful friend and chronographer. When in 2009, Guy Ritchie turned the very concept of Sherlock as we knew and as written by Conan Doyle on its head to come up with his version of a grubby, brawling Sherlock in an action packed, edgy thriller, a lot of the purists turned their eyebrows, and rightly so, because we all missed the cerebral Holmes.Circa 2011- Sherlock Holmes- Game of Shadows, even though picking off right from where it left in the previous movie, makes a brave attempt to bring back to the new fold, the faithful by creating a feature that has something to appeal to both- the action seekers, and the intellectually oriented. Sherlock is on the track of Professor Moriarty, the one who he believes is responsible for creating a chaos in Europe, and who, he later learns, wants to unleash a world war from which only he can benefit. The first half of the movie is a modern day action movie played in period costumes. The film opens with Watson getting all set to marry, despite Holmes' best assurances that he doesn't need anyone in his life other than Holmes himself. The movie hurtles through at bullet train speed, with some old characters being unceremoniously disposed off, and a slew of criminal activities portrayed across Europe which Holmes, though being at the right place at the right time, yet, is unable to prevent the machinations of an evil genius.The second half is where things slow down, and yet become more interesting, involving Holmes powers of deduction, memory, and intelligence- things that for a change would not make Doyle turn in his grave. Tension rises to a crescendo in a high stakes chess game between our hero and villain with a world changing assassination attempt going on in the background, and it is beautifully visualized that there is only one end to it. Its a battle in itself, this game, and kudos to Guy Ritchie for making the chess game and the associated mind games the focus, in spite of the wide-ranging ramifications of the assassination.Speaking of villains, Jared Harris as Moriarty is stupendous. Here is someone who is carries his cover as an Oxford professor sumptuously, yet can look fearsome even while grinning, in addition to be smart enough to match wits with Holmes, and in most cases outwit him. There is repressed hatred in the friendly badinage between Moriarty and Holmes. Which brings us to our heroes- clearly this is as much as Downey's movie as Law's for Watson's role has been considerably enhanced in this one- he is a hero himself, the time spend with Holmes has been put to good use by him. And it continues to be a dream comeback for Downey- he completely rules in the movie, only he can be so unfazed in the face of danger, and yet a buffoon to the core- his impersonation of a wall and chair is fabulous, as his extended turn in drag. The only time he misses his target is with his fake British accent. Downey and Law's chemistry was one of the few positives in the first movie, and in this one its gone up by several notches. Their banter is witty, smile inducing, and very very British- setting it apart from the usual Hollywood fare. Stephen Fry as Mycroft Holmes probably gets the best lines, and has loads of fun as someone who is as good as Holmes, and yet every bit as quirky.Guy Ritchie brings his familiar brand of manic energy and tongue in cheek humor into the movie. With an all European setting, the cinematography is awesome. The visual effects are very good, without being overbearing, and the musical score by Hans Zimmerman is as usual, a class apart. However, the extended use of slow motion deduction and action sequences do drag things after a while, though its the end forest bombarding sequence that has the most extraordinarily effective exposition of this technique. To sum up, this is a modern day action thriller set in 1891- as a result it has plenty in it to make the new fans happy, and enough wit, intellect and charm to retain the loyalists. Hence not only for fans who liked the first, but also for those who have a thing for Doyle. Powerpacked performances from the all star cast and high levels of technical competence makes this a solid, all round entertainer. A new years gift it is then- 10/10 for Robert Downey fans, 8/10 for others ;)",8,1,2,29 December 2011
The Monuments Men," great premise, lackluster treatment
","A galaxy of stars in George Clooney, Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Bill Murray, John Goodman, and Jean Dujardin. A theme that is epic- war. A villain that a world hates in Hitler. A director known to regularly punch above his weight in Clooney. Seems nothing can go wrong with The Monuments Men. A surefire sleeper hit, and a strong awards contender, is it? Not really. The movie is a prime example of the fact that great ingredients do not necessarily make a great movie.'You can wipe out an entire generation, you can burn their homes to the ground and somehow they'll still find their way back. But if you destroy their history, you destroy their achievements and it's as if they never existed. That's what Hitler wants and that's exactly what we are fighting for' The premise is great, the impact lackluster. Based on a true story, about the greatest treasure hunt in the history of mankind. We remember the Nazis for the holocaust and other war crimes, but something even more sinister was their attempt to steal, and later on as the Reich crumbles, try to destroy over 5 million pieces of art. A rag tag group of art historians and museum curators are asked to save over 1000 years of culture and heritage. Working in war-zones alongside combat units with imminent danger to their lives , this unlikely yet dedicated band of brothers chase down the thieves with an attitude bordering on flippancy. Therein lies The Monuments Men's major weakness. For something based on WW2, the tone of the movie is too casual, and the humor is too liberally spread. Seasoned actors go about their jobs breezily wisecracking in every inch of the film. And there is an attempt at a love angle between Blanchett and Damon. Why not- she is playing a French after all, she has to flirt. But most of the characters remain unfleshed out, and as a result, the movie lacks emotion, even when key character deaths occur or even when the Monalisa is found. To its credit though, the film is technically brilliant.Hitler had grand plans for the booty. He had planned a Fuhrermuseum that would stock all the art of the world. In case this scenario did not unfold, he had ordered the complete destruction of all that the Nazis had stolen. This was known as the Nero Decree. Being a lover of history and art, I cannot but be thankful to those who actually saved it all. But as far as movie goes, the similar themed 1964 Burt Lancaster starrer The Train is the miles better watch- 5/10",5,0,0,9 May 2014
The Expendables 2," Heartbreakingly Bad
","I am 35 years old, a rather early age, but today when i saw a transport aircraft successfully land inside a mine, i can confidently say- Dear God, I have seen it all. I have seen the hammiest group of currently senior citizen actors in the history of moviedom to get together for a sequel of an already poor film to deliver something worse. Sylvester Stallone and his gang of bulletproof mercenaries with a fondness for taking on medium sized foreign armies are back again in The Expendables 2, and the only good thing in the flick is the concept.Like its predecessor, Expendables 2 is a 80s action flick starring grizzled veterans of that era- the idea of seeing these ageing guys who just don't want to take their retirement benefits is better off as a concept only, than any actual movie. True, the mere thought of Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Willis and Norris firing away to glory in the SAME frame is stuff of wet dreams for most action fanboys- but only in concept, in dreams- in reality, when these 60+ fellas strut their stuff now, more than the body count, the profound thoughts that float in and out of the mind are mostly around who has done the better skin-lift, or who has the best hairdo, or the most effective botox shots or even the best body double.For the records, there is a plot- and it is as clichéd as any action movie goes. As the first mission, the expendables put down a militia somewhere in the world, and the second mission gets personal- a team member gets killed and plutonium gets stolen, and all is left to our heroes to save the world, in addition to taking revenge. The really old gang of Stallone, Jet Li, Jason Statham, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, and Dolph Lungdren are joined by new mate Liam Hemsworth and 'combat proficient' Yu Nan. Willis, and Schwarzenegger do more than just talk this time round, and are joined by another veteran who went 'missing in action' in the 80s – Chuck Norris. Keep it simple seems to be the mantra here- in reverence to their age, the Expendables fashionably hang out at a bar called The Old Point, even their transport aircraft is WW2 vintage, and the villain of this set piece, Jean Claude Van Damme is cleverly named Villain, too. Stallone looks like a genetic experiment gone hideously wrong and his old age must be the reason he doesn't see Yu Nang batting eyelids at him throughout. These 'has beens' speak exclusively in punchlines from their older movies. And when Stallone goes philosophical ('Why is it the ones who deserve to die keep on living?') and Dolph Lungren is the film's comic relief, you got to fear for your sanity. Quite late in the movie though- Arnold unintentionally utters the sole truthful line in the movie- ' We all belong to a museum'. The Expendables begin with a normally over the top rescue mission in Nepal where they blow up seemingly, the entire Nepalese army, to smithereens. There is a ropeway shootout, a speedboat chase and armoured truck race lasting all about 15 minutes, and all culminating in the opening credits. This is the point where if we are in a mall, it would be the best time to actually step out, do some shopping, eat a bit, look at beautiful women- do something useful, because the next hour is perhaps the most boring hour in the history of action movies, and that includes all the solo actioners these guys have ever featured. You could make your way back in time for the even more over the top climactic 15 minutes, and my take is you would have probably seen the entire action director Simon West has got in store for you in this movie, which though is deliciously graphic, but falls short both in quantity and quality. True, heads gets splattered, limbs get decapitated, there are creative knife throwing sequences, lots of things eventually explode, van Damme roundhouses, Arnold and Willis do manage to fit into a SmartCar, and the heroes cheerfully grin and chomp cigars nonchalantly gunning down thousands, but nothing is memorable. Even the final bare knuckle fistfight between Stallone and Van Damme is an insult to memories of Rocky, Rambo and Bloodsport- they talk more than they fight and in that they resemble my kind- the civilized Bengali (ever seen Bongs fight?). Jokes apart It probably hurts me more than anyone else because am a big time action fan and the 80s spawned some of the most unabashed movies in that genre. But with due respect, the last thing i wanted was memories of my childhood getting sullied by the atrocities of actors who still do not know their time is up.Well then, its a travesty all right, and definitely not recommended. There is precious little of action, intelligence, wit and all things good that we expect out of a movie, and i am genuinely surprised at the positive opinions this movie has gathered till date. According to me Expendables 2 is forgettable, and sadly so -5/10",5,16,25,1 September 2012
Skyfall," Skyfall - Most memorable Bond movie in this century!
","The cold war came and went, technology has undergone a sea change and the very definition of entertainment has changed, but here is an interesting data point- the Ipad 3 survived 6 months, James Bond 007 on the other hand has managed 600 months. And with @Skyfall, it seems he is good for 600 more as the movie is smart, savvy and surprisingly believable- good enough to restore life back into the franchise after the shameful Quantum of Solace.Who is James Bond? What do we know of him besides that that he is the occasional kiss kiss and the more frequent bang bang assassin working for the government? It has taken 50 years, 23 movies and an incredibly sharp director in Sam Mendes to delve into Bond's back-story, his origins, conjure up enough slam bam action in exotic locations and tie it in with a plot that is eerily realistic in today's world, cyber- terrorism. Skyfall does a dangerous tightrope act just right- on one hand it has enough campiness, cheesy one-liners, gadgets, car chases, femme fatales to keep old fans happy, and enough gritty action, intensity and a foreboding sense of mortality with a continued dose of bullheadedness that is the signature of Daniel Craig's Bond to keep the new fans satiated. Skyfall additionally boasts of some out of the world cinematography by Roger Deakins, sports one of the most mentally unhinged villains of the franchise in Javier Bardem's Raoul Silva, and like Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, is about endings as well as new beginnings.More of a personal battle this time round for Bond as an ex MI6 operative turned dangerous cyber terrorist Silva trains his guns on the only woman Bond has in his life and is really attached to- Judi Dench's M. In a brilliantly shot opening chase sequence involving super motards, Land Rover Defenders, Turkish rooftops and trains, Bond is shot by his own team and left for dead. Bond and Silva have similar backgrounds and similar mommy issues- but the latter when put in a similar situation takes it out on his ex-employers while Bond understands the rationale behind M allowing him to be sacrificed, and rallies to defend her against all odds. This is Craig's most effective outing since his chart busting debut in Casino Royale 6 years back. With due respect to Bonds of yore, wisecracking is certainly not up his alley, but as an action star and an incredibly buff Bond, he has no parallels. Judi Dench signs out in motherly style, and Ben Wishaw as the new Q is excellent- he in many ways is the pajamas wearing equivalent of Craig- brash and prone to making mistakes, yet brilliant and geeky. Ralph Fiennes is classy in a small role in Skyfall but lots of promise in future movies (wink wink). The ladies Naomi Harris and Bernice Marlohe remain serviceable eye candy, but its always a good thing for a movie when the villain is exceptional. Javier Bardem channelizes his own deadpan terror Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men, along with a bit of Heath Ledger's crazy cool sociopath Joker for a scene-stealing act as the suicidal Raoul Silva who literally loves M to death.What further sets Skyfall apart from the usual Bond movies is the third act, shot in beautiful, haunting Scotland, and has deep linkages to Bond's past- this part of the movie plays out like a taut thriller, a stakeout, a final stand by one old man and a woman along with our hero against an army adept at using both guns and the system. Speaking of beauty, globe trotting is a given in the franchise, but never has it been so pretty- the neons of Shanghai, the glitter of Macau, the lively walls of Istanbul, even a komodo dragon infested fight-pit are so beautiful that they are distracting- and that IS a compliment. Just note how shadows and light has been used to give a graphic novel feel to the entire production.Bottomline-Skyfall is just what you expect from a Bond movie- it is not a mindless actioner, nor a slow paced thriller. He gets to drive cool cars, he gets the girls, uses his license to kill and does all that with style. The Walther PPK is there, as there is the Aston DB5 and shaken martini. There is incredible acting talent, mind blowing action, gorgeous photography and an epic soundtrack. In the hands of a true auteur even cheesy can be made beautiful and involving- take a bow, Sam Mendes. There is camp to complement grit, intelligence and sensitivity to complement visual glory. Standing the test of time admirably then you are, Mr. Bond. Eagerly looking forward to your future adventures- 9/10",9,1,13,1 November 2012
Iron Man 3," Iron Man 3 movie review- All kinks ironed out
","Expectations from Marvel were high after last year's excellent Avengers, and the disappointment that was Iron Man 2. While it seems to be the last of a trilogy, the good news is that it ends with a bang. Iron Man 3 is full of thrills, verve and humor- a big budget summer blockbuster firing on all cylinders.'Ladies, children, sheep. Some call me a terrorist. I say I am a teacher' - MandarinFeeding on jihadistic impulse, the Bin Laden styled Mandarin seemingly emerges out of nowhere as the biggest terrorist threat the world has seen, coordinating random attacks across the world, and hacking his way into the homes of ordinary Americans. when Happy Hogan gets injured in one of the Mandarin attacks, Tony Stark, who is still suffering from anxiety issues after his epic defense of New York in The Avengers Movie, issues a challenge to the Mandarin and promptly gets bombed out. Flashback sequences talk of Adrian Killich requesting Stark's help for a new technology that reanimates destroyed limbs. while Stark declines, Killich rises over time to become a magnate in his own right developing the Extremis virus, which can make human bombs out of subjects, creating a new world of terror.Ironically, Iron man 3 is more about Tony Stark, and less about the suit. the movie has two distinct parts- the first is more of a detective adventure, the second is balls out VFX extravaganza. After the initial reversal, Stark connects the dots between the Mandarin and Killich, and then brings them down in a dizzyingly spectacular finale where an army of remote controlled Iron Man suits take on an army of Extremis virus powered super soldiers, at the same time rescuing the US President and Virginia 'Pepper' Potts. The party trick this time round is the self assembling suits that add to the fun and unpredictability. Iron Man 3 is an all out Robert Downey Jr show- he completely at home as Stark- Marvel has revived Downey's career the same way as Downey's act as Stark/Iron man is unparalled by any other star playing a super hero. He is spot on as the boy genius who does grow up, he makes everything look so easy whether rescuing people mid air, bantering with friends and enemies or dishing insults. Guy Pearce as the nerd turned terrorist is delightfully campy- after all this is a comic book, while Ben Kingsley's Mandarin is the funny twist no one will see coming. Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow reprise their roles as Cody Rhodes and Pepper Potts. Having written the Lethal Weapon movies, Director Shane Black has impressive action movie credentials, best exemplified in Iron Man 3's script- every frame left me either awestruck or guffawing. Full of liberal doses of humor, with not a single dull moment. 'You know, it's moments like these when I realize how much of a superhero I am'- Tony StarkI agree you are the best Marvel can offer, Mr. Stark. After watching Iron Man 3, happy to report that the state of the superhero film industry is in good health. Iron Man 3 builds on its traditional brand values of visual effects, humor and technology showcase, along with a smashing performance by Downey and a script that is fast, funny and whimsical. Good for two-time watch- 9/10",9,3,11,1 May 2013
It," light on scares
","So I went and saw IT, and came back unimpressed. I mean it was a good movie, no doubt about that. A bunch of kids, outcasts in their own right, being terrorized by an ancient demon that plays upon the fears of its victims is pretty much the standard in Hollywood horror movie territory. All the kids are well cast, the script is funny and tight, and there are plenty of monster shots. The cinematography is great, the pace is even and the CGI is flawless. But is more funny than terrifying- it's R rating more a justification of teenage slang in the script, rather than for true scares. But that is what typically Stephen King is all about. His stories are studies on relationships rather than all out horror. In IT, King reversed Spielberg's E.T, and explored everyday monsters of childhood- abuse, violence and neglect. Juxtapose that with an eternal evil shape-shifting entity who wakes up every 27 years to prey, and you have a shawarma of a plot. The book is scary, the movie isn't. Probably so because today, we are used to Stranger Things. We are used to kids doing stupendous stuff these days- whether running billion dollar companies, or bringing back lost souls from other dimensions. It all seems very easy for today's generation to figure things out- most of IT establishes this narrative. A wonderful group of actors face off against Bill Skarsgard's Pennywise the Dancing Clown, and they all nail their parts. The movie takes place in a town where all the adults are essentially villains- so its not just the kids versus the clowns everyone else. But for sheer impact, IT never reaches the highs it achieves in its first sequence. It is a great example of how strong marketing can make mediocre movies look a billion bucks. Other reviewers are putting IT right up there with other Stephen King adaptions such as The Shining and The Thing. Oh please, that would be laying it too thick. Director Andy Muschietti's earlier take on the genre- Mama, is a far better contender.No good horror movie can get away by being light on scares, however good the characters and the script are. So look at IT as an extension of Goonies or Stranger Things, a PG-13 romp, not an iconic horror movie. 7/10",7,126,248,9 September 2017
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Abraham Lincoln: Swing and a miss
","'History prefers legends to men'Why have vampires invaded pop culture? Is the lines between modern man and monster blurring? Is it a personality change preference for our generations- no longer for the cheerleader type, the darker the better- intelligent, moody, mysterious and reticent. Or is it just a heady concoction of fantasy-land entertainment and escapism? Whatever be the reason is not up for debate here, but a film with a name such as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter needs a bit of perspective.It takes a lot of gumption and imagination to portray one of history's most astute leaders as a Gothic horror hunter- AB:VH is based on Seth Graham Smith's 2010 mash-up fiction novel, and directed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov. In this alternate version of American history got extra bloody- it starts with young AB devastated by the killing of his mother by a vampire, and somehow that gets linked to his hatred of slavery. AB, played by Benjamin Walker, dedicates the rest of his life hunting for his mother's killer and later on declares total war on the racist bloodsuckers (yes, racist- all the vampires in the movie are white and they feeding on the black slaves is termed an essential reason for slavery to continue), in the pursuit of which he is mentored by a repentant vampire- Henry Sturges in his journey from a fledgling assassin to a vampire hunting politician. Vampire fiction is an open canvas these days, with their powers changing at the sway of any particular authors brush-strokes. In AB's world, all vampires need is sunscreen and sunglasses, and pronto- they can walk in the sun. No stake through the heart, or the revered cross and holy water combo- Henry says that ever since Judas was given 30 pieces of silver for his betrayal, silver became the curse of the cursed, so these vampires can be killed by all things silver, and joyfully, AB silver coats his chosen weapon to hunt the infernal species till about interval. Post that he has to concentrate on his family life, his political career and govern the country through its most troubled times. His skills with the axe are again called back upon when vampires start turning the tide in the Civil War against him. Historical fallacies be damned but even the initial reversals at the historical battle of Gettysburg are attributed to the undead, and more ridiculous is the way AB marshals all the silver in the land into bayonets and canon shells, all within a span of a day (The actual Gettysburg battle lasted 2 days). But then this is not a thinking man's movie, for with a name as Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, ridiculousness should come marked in capital letters on the package. And unfortunately, it doesn't. Who wouldn't want to laugh at bearded AB with his swinging axes tearing apart the undead? This is a movie that should have been fun- gone all out over the top, put in some jokes, upped the entertainment and involvement, but it tries to play safe- fusing intense vampire flick with a campy premise. Don't get me wrong though- the film has plenty of bright spots- first of all, Benjamin Walker who looks like a younger Liam Neeson, is solid as AB, and Dominic Cooper as Henry has a great time too. Since our hero handles an axe rather well, gore lovers can expect a fair share of decapitations and other brutalities. The action scenes are fairly unorthodox- at one point, a vampire throws a horse at AB! The artwork and costumes is impressively detailed- the first shot in the movie is sheer genius- starts with contemporary skyline of Washington and then slowly changes to settings 150 years ago, with an under construction White House. I being a lover of historical themed movies didn't find the pace slow too. On the flip side, Timur Bekmambetov overall treatment errs on the side of caution to make this a humorless affair. While his earlier takes on vampires (Nightwatch and Daywatch) were visionary and Wanted was in its own way excellent, this one is kind of a step down. 3D and horror are made for each other- AB:VH has a couple of scary moments, wish there were more. Mary Elizabeth Winstead as AB's supportive wife Mary Todd stepped on a bowler's hat to unattainable heights, might be a 'creature of ravishing resourcefulness' but doesn't get too much to do. The special effects were largely inconsistent- some of the fights were excellent, but others were cartoonishly childish, including the climactic burning bridge sequence. Also a curious lack of star power, and a non charismatic and non scary villain in Rufus Sewell didn't help either.To sum up, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is not for everyone- its neither a historical as it is factually inaccurate, and its neither a fully blown monster epic. It is essentially an alternate history romp into silliness played with admirable seriousness thus doing somewhat justice to its title- for some people it will work, for some it will not. Not too scary and not too funny and lacking zing- 6/10 from a horror movie fan, then.",6,1,4,14 July 2012
Gravity," As the poster says, Do'nt let go. Do'nt let go of the movie. Watch it!
","For long, superhero and other action movies have made space look like walk in the park. But drop that kid friendly filter, take a shot of realism, and then look- space is both at once, a beautiful, and a terrifying experience. Beautiful because of the views it offers, the peace it gives and terrifying because of the silence, and of our own insignificance in the void. No other movie in the recent past portrays space as realistically as Alfonso Cuaron's Gravity. Essentially a tale about two astronauts caught in a debris storm in space, and trying to make it back, Gravity is a mesmerizing experience- a unique thriller about soundless explosions, sacrifice and wry humor, but above all, a triumph of the human spirit, and the will to live. Particularly effective is the scene when the grizzled veteran astronaut drifts away in space, but still does not forget that he has to guide the greenhorn, and continues to do so till his last breath. There are just two actors in the entire movie- George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, there is an Asian character whose face we do not see. But these two seasoned actors are at the top of their game, am sure Bullock will pocket an Academy award nomination, and even Clooney has a shot. Cuaron is an artist of the highest class, his direction is impeccable, the script is a perfectly tuned cliffhanger, the editing is perfect, the sound track is masterful, the imagery is exhilarating and the special effects are eye popping, more so because most of the destruction happens in silence, when we least expect it.The 3D just amplifies the effects.After a surfeit of big budget explosive summer extravaganzas, this is what the doctor asked for. Gravity personifies the reasons movies were made in the first place IE. to give viewers an experience out of their ordinary lives, to sit on the edge of a chair, throats dry, wishing for something out of your control to happen. Tense, sentimental and nightmarishly engaging- this one begins somewhere in the stars, and actually remains high up there. Unmissable in 3D- 10/10",10,2,3,16 October 2013
Fury," Hits the nail on the head
","Fury is the most authentic war movie in a decade. Shot from the point of view of an American Sherman tank crew driving towards the heart of Nazi Germany in 1945, it is grim, visceral and remorseless, at the same time it is graceful, honest and uplifting.Boyd- 'Wait until you see it. Norman- 'See what?' Boyd- 'What a man can do to another man'Wars are never good, even the ones we celebrate for being for the right reason. While we tend to gloss over the way it is waged, there is no denying the fact that it brings out the animal in us humans. Especially so the Second World War, that claimed over 80 million lives through genocide, massacres, civilian bombing, disease and starvation. Towards the end of the European theater of war, Hitler declared total war, throwing every man, woman, and child available at allied armies. Fury starts by saying that the American tanks were out-gunned and outnumbered by the German tanks. Sure the Tiger tanks were superior, but the allies outnumbered everything the Germans had, four to one. Wardaddy: 'I started this war killing Germans in Africa. Then I killed Germans in Italy, and then Germans in Belgium. Now I'm killing Germans in Germany.'Wardaddy (Brad Pitt) is an illustrious tank commander, leading a battle hardened crew, together since the North African campaign, Italy offensive and the Battle of the Bulge, in the final push towards Berlin. The tank was the most useful instrument of terror in WW2, and invariably for the crew, the tank is both their armor and their coffin. The fulcrum of Germany's blitzkrieg in 1939-40 was largely fast moving tanks, and the allies gave a taste of the same medicine 5 years later. The crew includes Shia LeBouf as Boyd Swan, Michael Pena as Trini Garcia, Jon Berenthal as Grady Travis, and new recruit Logan Lerman as Norman Ellison, who joins in place of the recently deceased assistant driver. Norman has never seen the insides of a tank, and is not ready for the kill or be killed job description. In a way much of the movie is about Norman coming of age as a soldier.Irma: 'Where are you going?' Wardaddy: 'To take the next town. And the next. And the next. Till you guys give up'The best part about Fury is that it does not shy away from depicting the horrors of war- blown up limbs, cut up torsos, crushed bodies, burning men shooting themselves, kids fighting tanks with nothing more than panzerfausts, earth movers shoving piles of corpses into mass graves- it is all there. Director David Ayer bases the screenplay on a collection of true stories from war veterans, and hence it is extremely realistic- right down to the wanton destruction, the claustrophobic setting, the alternating of the crew between animalistic and humane, noble and brutal, and how easily the feared tank can become an easy prey to superior tactics and technology . The film is technically brilliant, the script is overwhelmingly quote-worthy, the cinematography, and action is original and sensible. The world's only working Tiger tank was used in the rollicking sequence against Fury and its cohorts. The casting, and as a result the overall acting is spot on, as is the rousing music score.Norman: 'They're coming'. Wardaddy: 'How many?' Norman: 'They're 300 of them' Trini: 'It's five against 300' Wardaddy: We ain't never run before. Why we gonna run now?'Pitt is relatively restrained and does an excellent job as the responsible leader, keeping his wits about even in the most trying of times. It is only towards the climax, when it is 5 men and a broke tank against an entire SS battalion, that the super hero in him emerges. Spoiler alert, it is easier to survive a zombie apocalypse than WW2, even if you are Brad Pitt.Wardaddy: 'It will end, soon. But before it does, a lot more people have to die'The best kind of war movies make you squirm in your seat and hate war. Despite being kind of predictable, and with an unrealistic climax, Fury passes this litmus test with flying colors. Gory, yet sensitive, Fury is overall, very very impressive- 8/10",8,2,8,2 November 2014
World War Z," memorable action, moderate scares
","What more can we do with zombies? From its low budget thriller roots, we have seen the undead in comedies, westerns and even romance. World War Z however has what no zombie movie has ever got- get a mega-star to globe trot the world, spend gazillions in special effects and scary 3D, in short give it blockbuster status. Is that a good thing? Mostly so, because World War Z is a great action movie, but unlike what fans of the genre absolutely cannot do without- it is not scary enough, it is not gory enough.Based on Max Brooks' apocalyptic novel by the same name, it kind of deviates from the book which essentially is a 'commentary on government inabilities, corruption and human short sightedness. Brad Pitt acquired the rights to make a film version of the same, and converted it into a USD 250 million summer blockbuster replete with massive CGI and the usual 'white man saving the world'theme. The start is awesome- at a traffic jam in Pittsburgh, Gerry Lane (Pitt) and his family have their first encounter with the zombies, who in turn are not like any other zombies seen before. They do not amble aimlessly. They turn within seconds, and know how to work together. They are an animalistic, feral lot- running, leaping and snarling. The violence hits searingly fast, although to get a PG13 rating, much to my dismay, there is no actual zombie chomping flesh, or for that matter, any blood on screen. The infection spreads across the globe with lightning speed and the only safe places it seems are the warships. To keep his family safe, Lane has to traverse the world to find a cure to the pandemic. All this global traipsing gives ample opportunities for the mega bucks to show. And show it does in some style- the zombie mountain shots as they overrun Jerusalem's mighty walls is incredible, as is the manic infestation sequence in the airline and the tense climax in a W.H.O center. The movie revolves around Brad Pitt, who plays an everyday superhero- he is resourceful, brave, unpretentious and driven. Everybody else is a placeholder, including Pitts on screen better half Mirielle Enos in her first big budget appearance. Director Marc Forster manages to create a panicky mood, and the changing face of humanity in face of unprecedented calamity. His job was to make R rated fare into PG13 impactful and that he does as well as one could.To sum up, this is a zombie flick for the masses, not zombie movie fans. Fans of the genre might be disappointed at the lack of blood and bones, they would be better off with Romero, Boyle or any episode of The Walking Dead. But for people seeking action set pieces with memorable special effects, this one is right up there with the years' best- 7/10",7,0,7,22 June 2013
The Hunger Games," The Hunger Games- Lively, Engaging, Violent- First real blockbuster of the year!
","Hungry for an excellent dystopian tale? How about a future where subjugated folks have to commit a ritual sacrifice, and teens kill each other off on prime time TV? How about a world where a totalitarian regime induces massive divide of resources? And how about an underdog story, where a 16 year old girl is able to beat the odds stacked against her and emerge as the new hope for the downtrodden.Based on the first part of Suzy Collins' trilogy, it introduces us to a version of the world where the ruling nation is Panem, built on the ruins of war torn North America, which exerts total control over its 12 impoverished districts. Capitol, Panem's central city, is home to a wealthy, decadent elite, whose comfort is supported by the labor of those districts. The 12 districts had rebelled, ever since the rebellion was quelled, Panem conducts an annual event to drive home the notion of their dominion. In this annual event, a boy and a girl between the ages of 12 and 18 are chosen from each district by means of an annual lottery to engage in a battle for survival in a huge arena with cameras capture and transmit live to an audience, every move, every detail and of course, every gory death. The idea of domination through this gladiatorial display is intriguing, but as Donald Sutherland's cynical and twisted President Snow remarks – 'Hope, it is the only thing stronger than fear. A little hope is effective, a lot of hope is dangerous' – the games give control over the 12 districts not only through fear but also through the hope that Panem will allow one to live.The movie is long at 144 minutes, but not a single minute feels needless or unimportant, even though the fighting starts post interval. Right at the outset, we are introduced to the central character, Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old who volunteers to participate in the 'games' in place of her sister. Jennifer Lawrence plays Katniss with a rare combination of beauty, vulnerability, resourcefulness and steel. Katniss develops skills such as getting people to like her, and her god gifted abilities of being able to hunt, to survive the bloodbath. In the process, she makes friends, unites people, and wins hearts. And she comes out with more than her life intact, she also finds love.Hunger Games targets the same audience as the Twilight series- female teens, features lethal kids, a love triangle, creative imagination and violence. But as a movie it leaves the vampire tales way behind in its effectiveness and involvement. The pace is brisk, there is plenty of shaky cam shots, the sound is often drowned out in the ultra violent scenes which gives it a surreal effect, but also helps the movie get a PG13 rating. The deaths are quickly done without much heart rendering, and the cinematography is simply awesome- Director Gary Ross who gave us Seabiscuit 10 years back, literally transports the audience into this dark and desolate jungle, where you can feel the hopelessness of Katniss through his signature close up shots. Blue haired TV host Ceasar, played by Stanley Tucci exemplifies the citizens of the Capitol who display the aesthetic cues of sci-fi fascism- fluorescent hairdos, crazy fashion, garish furniture, gaudy costumes and an excess of everything. Watching Hunger Games, i couldn't resist drawing parallel to the modern Japanese classic- Battle Royale, with a similar story, but with a lot more gore, and with the children there actually enjoying the killing as compared to the more refined sensibilities of this version. But then, do i root for Katniss? But doesn't that mean i wish for the other children to butcher themselves? Is'nt it immoral?All is fair when it comes to entertainment though, and Hunger Games is outstanding when it comes to that. We have a heroine who can make us cry for her, dishing out a layered performance and cementing her position as one of the leading young actresses of Hollywood. There is plenty of drama and romance, un-inhibited action, and some understated but superbly effective special effects. This has edge of the seat excitement, and intense drama, and i finally get the feeling that summer is on- this is the first summer blockbuster of the year! As the tagline goes- The World Will Be Watching- will you?May the odds always remain in its favour- 9/10",9,1,11,25 March 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," Utterly familiar yet exceptionally original- 9/10
","2009's Star Trek is the best remake of a franchise ever, while 1982's Wrath of Khan was perhaps the best movie in the original franchise, credited with saving Star Trek as we know it, after the debacle that was the 1979 Star Trek movie. So what do you get when you marry the creative team of the 2009 re-imagining and folklore from the 1982 classic? A cerebral thrill ride that is action packed, dramatic, funny at the same time staying true to the TV series and films, along with restoring the one weakness of the 2009 movie- the lack of a grand villain. The film picks up from around the point the earlier one ended. The team is no longer greenhorn but Kirk and trouble continue to go hand in hand. So right at the outset we are plunged into chaotic urgency, when Spock dives into a volcano to save a primitive culture from annihilation, Kirk and Bones escape spears that rather come whizzing straight at us in 3D and the Enterprise rises out of the sea to both- play god and save the day. But the Prime Directive of not to interfere with a planet's culture is broken even though Spock and the planet is saved, and Kirk is set to lose command of the Enterprise. But surprise attacks on Starfleet by a supremely gifted terrorist- John Harrison leaves the earth in turmoil. Kirk regains the Enterprise and is tasked by Starfleet commander Marcus (Peter Weller) to assassinate Harrison who has taken refuge in a Klingon planet. Harrison later on reveals himself to be Khan- a genetically enhanced being who was being used by Marcus to develop advanced weaponry so as to eradicate the Klingons once and for all. Khan is potentially unstoppable, a superhuman, capable of singlehandedly taking out battalions and is faster, stronger and smarter than the best humans have to offer. How does the crew of the Enterprise stop him? In the end though, justice is served, and the battle won, but not before San Francisco takes one for the team. The returning actors slip onto their roles with minimal fuss. While Oblivion was driven by cinematography, and Downey completely owned Iron Man 3, the entire Star Trek team are stars here. Friendship, heroism, and sacrifice- all the ideals of Star Trek are happily on display, often from unexpected quarters. The heart of Star Trek has always been the relationship between the brash and instinctive Kirk and the logical, cautionary Spock. Rivalry and comradeship both are exhibited, and towards the end they kind of reverse the roles- Kirk does what Spock would have done because it would have been logical, and Spock in turn takes out a page from his captain's book. It is a hyper active, energetic ride, filled with character based gags and clever one liners. JJ Abrams has ensured Star Trek into Darkness matches up to its predecessor in every way, but out-punches it in one crucial round- the villain. Benedict Cumberbatch is menacing and sinister as Harrison/Khan. People familiar with BBC's Sherlock know that he has a magnetic personality- here he is scene stealing as a complex and ruthless nemesis who believes in his villainy, and executes it with style and grandeur. The 3D effects are a bit inconsistent, but the action is intense and creative throughout, whether it is simple fisticuffs or giant spaceships blowing each other to smithereens. In short Star Trek Into Darkness it is utterly familiar AND exceptionally original. Do Trekkies and other mortal beings need anything more? The sci-fi world has long been divided among Trekkies and Star Wars. It is now public that the same team that infused new life into the Star Trek series will work on the reboot of the Star War series too. So the popcorn does not end here, folks- come 2015, the Star War fans will have their day. Till then venture into this breathlessly paced darkness and come out energized! 9/10",9,7,18,11 May 2013
Aquaman," Aquaman is a fun affair!
","Aquaman is a blast!DC got everything right for a change, and in doing so James Wan conjures (pun intended) a level of entertainment that bests their greatest in this decade- Wonder Woman. The humor, action, acting, editing, all are spot on for a change, and Jason Momoa as Aquaman is as inspired a choice as Gal Gadot was.This connected universe thing is not DC's cup of tea. They never established the characters well enough to connect them like Marvel did, and each movie was tonally different. DC's 2018 shift towards independent, disconnected universe way is far better than them copying the Marvel way. Aquaman though, introduced in fine style in 2017's Justice League is a remnant of their connected strategy. Momoa isn't the only guy bringing the house down though, the key guy here is James Wan. Wan has injected a sense of fun that helps entertain a wider audience, which DC so far lacked. Not that he has given up on his horror roots- some of the sea creatures and inspiring visuals will not look out of place in the Conjuring universe.Watching a comic book movie requires you to enter into the theater with an open mind. In this case, that is an underwater world, complete with shark and whale riders, highways for turtle-cabs, sea horses that are quite literally sea horses, bongo playing octopuses, giant prehistoric monsters, pink haired Dolph Lungdren- you get the idea.Aquaman picks up where Steppenwolf is defeated in Justice League, and people of earth know of a sea dweller who is out to help them. A backstory gives Arthur Curry's origin- eldest son of the queen of Atlantis who fell in love with a lighthouse keeper. She was apparently executed for her infidelity, but you know DC movies are all about mommies, so hold that thought. Arthur's half brother Orm wants to unite all the undersea kingdoms (yes, there are 7!) and wage war with Donald Trump and the rest of us genteel land dwellers because of global warming, ocean trash, pollution etc. Only Arthur can take him on, but for that he needs the Trident of Atlan. He is helped by Mera, daughter of Sir Pink Hair Dolph, and Vulko, counselor of Atlantis, while in his way stands Orm and his dreams of becoming Ocean Master, and his comic book nemesis, Black Manta.Arthur Curry: I'm no leader. I'm not a king.
Mera: Atlantis has always had a king. Now it needs something more.
Arthur Curry: Well, what could be greater than a king?
Mera: A hero.In one fell swoop, Wan provides an exciting origin story for both hero and villain, a believable romantic angle, and an emotional family drama, replete with epic battle scenes that shade Star Wars, and thrilling expedition sequences that match up to Indiana Jones. Momoa plays Aquaman as he played Khal Drogo- brashness and physicality that he has made his own, along with doses of humor and charm- no lasso of truth required for him to lay out his feelings for Mera. Speaking of whom, Mera is perhaps Amber Heard's first big budget role, and she fits the Atlantean princess to the T. Nicole Kidman is the most charming DC superhero mommy, and Yahya Abdul Mateen is a passionate Black Manta. Patrick Wilson as Orm is probably the only miscasting, but he too gamely plays along.Many thought this year's greatest spectacle was Avengers:Infinity War but do watch Aquaman and you may be pleasantly surprised.",9,4,6,16 December 2018
Deadpool 2," Bigger, better and most importantly- funnier!
","After surviving a near fatal bovine attack, a disfigured cafeteria chef (Wade Wilson) struggles to fulfill his dream of becoming Miami's hottest bartender, while also learning to cope with his lost sense of taste. Searching to regain his spice for life, as well as a flux capacitor, Wade must battle ninjas, the yakuza, and a pack of sexually aggressive canines, as he journeys around the world to discover the importance of family, friendship, and flavor - finding a new taste for adventure and earning the coveted coffee mug title of World's Best Lover.That was the synopsis of Deadpool 2 as released by Twentieth Century Fox. Typically, loony, irreverent and fun as the movie itself.Deadpool: Fuck Wolverine. First he rides my coattails with the R-rating, and then, that hairy motherfucker ups the ante by dying! What a dick! Well, guess what, Wolvie? I'm dying in this movie.As it was in 2016, there was Deadpool on one side, and there was everything else from Hollywood on the other side. Wacky R-rated humor paired with obscene violence, and frequent fourth wall breaking paired with a narcissist of an anti-hero, Deadpool set a template that only Deadpool 2 could hope to match up. And match up it did, with oodles of style.Deadpool: And every good family film starts with a vicious murder - Bambi, The Lion King, Saw VII...2017 may have been Wolverine's year but 2018 is Deadpool's. And as he points out just before he mourns Wolverine's death in a montage that will send most James Bond themes to shame- this is a family film. The Merc with a Mouth has gone global, diligently killing bad guys, while dreaming of starting a family with Vanessa. But one of his targets escape and kill Vanessa, leading to the unkillable Deadpool becoming suicidal.Deadpool: George Michael was right, I'm never going to dance againColossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead try to make Deadpool into a X-Man but then shit happens. Machete don't tweet, and Deadpool no X-Man.Colossus: We have rules. You are not judge, jury or executioner.
Deadpool: Fuck your rules! I fight for what's right, and sometimes you gotta fight dirty.Deadpool ends up in a prison for mutants where their powers are taken away by a collar strapped on to the neck and waits for his death because with the collar on, his superpower is just unbridled cancer. As he quietly resigns himself to grow some tumors, he finds another reason to live- defending a young mutant (Firefist) destined for bad things from a super soldier from the future- Cable, whose family has been murdered by Firefist. In the future, of course.Cable: Who are you?
Deadpool: I'm Batman.And then it begins. Even though Cable in the movie is 5'11 only unlike the comics, Deadpool is badly mauled by him in round 1, and Deadpool assembles a team to take him on. Zietgeist, Bedlam, Shatterstar, Vanisher, Domino and Peter make up X-Force, because-Deadpool: Thank you, Bedlam. I was always appalled by the blatant sexism in the group's name. X-Men? *Men*? The point is, our group will be forward-thinking. Gender neutral. From now on, we'll be known as... X-Force.
Except for Domino- the mutant with the ability to manipulate luck, none of the other X-Force team members make it beyond 2 minutes of screen time. And soon, the 'coolest Marvel character never to be used as of yet in the right way' is unleashed- JuggernautDeadpool: It has always been a dream to see my face reflected in your helmet.
Juggernaut: I will rip you into half
Deadpool: That is exactly what Juggernaut will say.Ripped in half he is, and like in Deadpool, Wade had to slow-grow a hand, this time he has to slow-grow a pair of legs. Soon, my enemy's enemy is my friend mentality takes over, Cable, X-Force and X-Men unite to take down the big bad while also preventing Firefist from becoming a killer. And kudos to the editing team to fast forward the climax just when it seemed it will go all Groundhog Day.As they say, it is often not the actor finding the role, that the role finds the actor. Ryan Reynolds channelizes all of his rom-com pedigree to sell this chaotic comedy. All the other actors do a great job too, including Josh Brolin as the diametrically opposite Cable, Zazie Beetz as the straight faced Domino, and TJ Miller as the weaselly Weasel. Besides there is a host of blink and you miss celebrity cameos that are worth the price of the ticket- Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Alan Tudyk, the entire X-Men cast, and a thousand pop culture references (my favorite being John Cusack's boombox scene from Say Anything when Deadpool serenades Colossus) that will demand incessant viewings. Bigger, better and more cohesive that the first, with a funnier script, extended special effects and great characters- Deadpool 2 sets the bar even higher for R-rated action comedies.I am not saying that Deadpool 2 is the best movie of the year, but it is most definitely the one that you will laugh in the most. As Deadpool says, hope the Academy is watching.",10,1,2,21 May 2018
Thor: Ragnarok," funtastic!
","For long, comic book movies were a genre onto themselves- of caricatured characters, clichÃ©d scripts and hackneyed plots. In the past couple of years though, comic book movies have been traversing genres. If Captain America: The Winter Soldier played out like a political thriller, Deadpool an R-rated comedy, Logan was a good old Western, Wonder Woman was mostly a war movie, The New Mutants seems to be a horror flick, and Thor: Ragnarok- despite delivering a heady mix of sci-fi and myths, is an out and out family friendly comedy! Thor: 'I know what you're thinking: how did this happen? Well, it's a long story...'For the shortest Marvel film ever, Thor: Ragnarok has a ginormous plot, and things start off at a point where Thor is hanging, literally. We last saw him in Avengers: Age of Ultron. 2 years have passed by, and Thor's search for the infinity stones leads to him being a prisoner of Surtur- the fire demon. Surtur informs that Odin has forsaken Asgard, and that Ragnarok is about to happen. Thor manages to overpower Surtur,uncovers Loki's trickery and believes the danger has past. But soon he has to confront his father's death, and as a result, the appearance of Hela, Goddess of Death who was till now restrained by the presence of Odin. The Goddess of Death proceeds to do what any Goddess of Death worth her salt would do IE. kill everyone. In the process, Mjolnir is shattered, and with it, Thor's self belief. Without Odin, the universe itself is different, Thor learns it the hard way.Fighting Hela while traveling through the Bifrost, Thor and Loki end up in Sakaar- a garbage planet connected by multiple wormholes, and ruled by The Grandmaster, who specializes in organizing gladiatorial contests. Thor is forced to participate in the contest, and it is there that he meets a friend from work. The rest of the movie is hahahaha,crash, boom, bang, and hahahaha- as Thor and his friends set to get out of Sakaar to prevent Ragnarok from happening. Thor: I had this unique hammer, made from the heart of a dying star. I would spin it, and I would fly. Korg: You rode a hammer? Thor: No, I would lie down. Korg: The hammer rode you? Thor: No, I would spin it and it would lift me off... Korg: Oh my god, the hammer threw you off? Thor: Off the ground, it threw me off the ground!Kind of strange that a movie named Ragnarok, where worlds are supposed to end, ends up becoming a non stop gag reel, and still manages to convey scale and impact. All credit though to Marvel to allow full creative freedom to director Taika Waititi, who fused two iconic story lines from the Marvel comics archives- Planet Hulk and Ragnarok, added a humorous screenplay, ensured a zingy 80s soundtrack, a million color palette, and allowed every actor (whether hero or villain) a shot at being at their funniest best for the movie. Waititi even motion captures Korg, the breakout character for me in the movie. Korg is made out of rocks, and tried to start a revolution without printing enough pamphlets, but don't let that intimidate you ðŸ˜ŠChris Hemsworth's comedic timing meanwhile is a revelation. Thor goes through the complete character arc in the movie- bumbling and naive to a relatively wise king of Asgard, and Hemsworth delivers with a twinkle in his eye. Tessa Thompson's Valkryie is a nice addition to the team, and do watch out for special appearances from Matt Damon, Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum.W for wit, W for weird and W for Winter which is just round the corner. Embrace silliness. Go and watch Thor: Ragnarok, and do stay on for at-least the mid-credits scene for more news on the Marvel Big Bad. 10/10",10,1,10,4 November 2017
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," for the discerning few
","Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Sailor, Rich Man, Poor Man, Beggar Man, Thief.This is a common counting game, or nursery rhyme. This is also the greatest spy story ever told by arguably the finest writer of the genre, John LeCarre. And like Fleming, why are leCarre's work so inspired- because of his own spy background. In the real world is name is David Cromwell, and he was unfortunate enough to have his cover blown to the KGB by a MI6 double agent. Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy in many ways then is the story of his own life.Control: 'I know Moscow has planted a mole in MI6, and it is one of five men- Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Poorman and Beggarman'. A failed conversion attempt of a Hungarian general by a MI6 operative sets off the witch-hunt for this elusive mole by 'Beggarman' Gary Oldman. This forms the basis of the movie, which is an intense concoction of dramatic interrogations, revealing flashbacks, and all pervading sense of paranoia. Set in the 70s mostly in grubby London and some more of Europe, this movie is about the real world of spies vs spies- No gunfights, slam bang car chases, high stake heists and liberal use of weapons of mass destruction. Rather this one is grim and cerebral, consists of whispered conversations in sealed rooms that help put snippets of the puzzle together to flesh out someone who has been an enigma till date. The movie has moments of dullness where nothing happens, yet so utterly engrossing that you don't move out of your seat till the final chapter plays out. And a large part of the film's appeal lies in the iconic, all British starcast- John Hurt as Control, Toby Jones as Tinker, Colin Firth as Tailor, Ciaran Hinds as Soldier, David Dencik as Poorman, Mark Strong as Jim and of course, Gary Oldman as Beggarman/Smiley. All these masters put on their best acting suits to keep the viewer engaged in an essentially drab, weathered, smoke filled setting, where the closest thing to excitement is often the telephone bell ringing. There are occasional moments of shocking cruelty but yet why the movie really works is that every little scene remains important allowing us to simultaneously conduct over very own investigations into the case, and the fact that till the very end you don't know who to trust and who not to. As the inquisitive Smiley, Gary Oldman is stupendous- here is a spy who due to personal issues may be beaten but is not broken, who pursues his task through a world filled with distrust, and corruption with a quiet sense of capability, intelligence and ruthlessness. Colin Firth, fresh from his Oscar, has a small but significant role is brutally effective, John Hurt plays his usual fatherly self, while the supporting cast of Benedict Cumberbatch and Tom Hardy put in crucial and nuanced performances.Director Tom Alfredson has already impressed with the authentic vampire story- Let The Right One In, and here in addition to condensing source matter which the BBC did in 7 hour-long episodes, into a compact 2 hour feature, he also stitches together a gloomy and impenetratable atmosphere along with layered performances from the cast to create a film not for everyone, but rewarding for those who know how to look and listen. 9/10 and for the discerning viewers only.

The Adventures of Tintin," A sinful trip down nostalgia lane
","Tintin- a trip down nostalgia lane. My first tryst with the Belgian icon was in 1981- when my father first read out The Crab with the Golden Claws in a bid to get me to go to school. I picked up snippets at first, and made him read it to me again and again and again...net result- lifetime fan. Herge considered Spielberg as the only one who could do justice to his comics on the big screen, and with peter Jackson too in the scheme of things, how right he was. The movie mixes two of the best stories- The Crab with the Golden Claws and The Secret of the Unicorn to come up with 120 mins of uninhibited thrill, energy and globe trotting 3D fun. Tintin is the very pinnacle of motion capture with the attention to details being fantastic- the expressions are so so so very real, the look of the characters is spot on as if they just jumped out of the comic book in your drawer, the opening sequence that pays homage to all of Tintin adventures is perhaps the best ever opening sequence, when Tintin and friends give chase to an ultra competitive falcon tearing down a whole city in the sidelines, we get the best ever chase sequence, and when Haddock battles Red Rackham on the open seas, we get the best ever sea battle sequence! I was mesmerized most of the movie, occasionally screaming silly now and then...In short, Barney would say that the overall CGI levels are legen...wait for it....dary! Snowy antics make him the crowd favorite easily, but since we touched upon Haddock- well, he simply rocked. Andy Serkis is a superstar at motion capture (think Gollum, King Kong) and here he steals every scene as the grumpy but endearing, booze crazy Archibald Haddock...hell, so towering is he that they should have called this movie the Adventures of Captain Haddock! The most enjoyable movie of the year so far, will satisfy old fans, and create new ones. Can Spielberg+Jackson please get the next installment out soon? Am game for another watch anytime- 10/10",10,0,3,24 December 2011
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Incy Wincy Spider
","Why the 3rd reboot in 15 years? Because Spiderman is ranked 3rd in IGN's top comic book heroes list. Because Spiderman is Stan lee's greatest creation, and he is also the ultimate everyday hero. Because Spiderman is the most profitable superhero in the world- global retail licensed Spiderman products outsell revenue from Justice League and Avengers COMBINED. Because Spiderman movies have made over $4 billion at the box office.No wonder Marvel wanted him so bad into their fold. Bringing him back to the Marvel Cinematic Universe works out well though, as in his first solo outing, Marvel effortlessly integrates the friendly, neighborhood character into the bigger scheme of things. And all it took, was to set it up in school. The plot is built around the challenges Peter has in adjusting to school life after the epic airport brawl in Captain America: Civil War. Peter thinks he is ready for more missions, but Tony Stark does not. And if we thought at the end of Civil War that Stark would take on an active mentoring role for Peter, we were wrong. He has outsourced that to Happy Hogan. Peter alternates between fighting localized crime, and going weak in the knees whenever Liz Toomes passes by. When a robbery crew led by the technology scavenging Vulture begins to up the stakes in the neighborhood, Peter gets hot on their trails. And much like in the previous movies, Spidey villains are closer than far.More The Breakfast Club than a superhero movie, Homecoming weaves comedy, teen angst, MCU and Star Wars references, lots of Spiderman supporting characters, and Avengers' cameos into an entertaining, if not entirely flawless narrative. And much like the Staten Island ferry in the film, Tom Holland holds it all together with his frenetic, nervous energy. Like the comic-book Spiderman, Holland's version is a kid trying to be a man, unlike Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield before him, who were more like men trying to be kids. Juxtaposed to an everyday hero is a great everyday villain- Michael Keaton's Vulture makes a great debut too- one can sympathize with his grievances, and his moral code. The action sequences do not really stand out, but then this movie is not really about action.Is this the best Spidey movie ever? In my opinion, no- Sam Raimi's Spiderman 2 still is the one to beat. But Spiderman: Homecoming comes close, and that itself is an achievement. 8/10",8,3,7,8 July 2017
Fast & Furious 6," Thrill ride par excellence
","For motor-heads, the Fast and Furious franchise is pure sin, the sins getting bigger and badder with every sequel. But the franchise is more than just car flicks. They have established an instant connection with today's youth culture gorged in hip hop, street cred and video game violence, spanning continents. While many thought that the previous installment Fast Five was the very pinnacle the series could aim for, out comes Fast and Furious 6, breaking all previous boundaries, and shattering myths that a 6th installment cannot be creative, and is one too many. Before we talk of the movie though, let us take a moment to absorb the legend of the sullen hero- Vin Diesel.'If you rearrange the letters in Vin Diesel it reveals his credo: 'I End Lives.' 'Vin Diesel invented black. In fact, he invented the entire spectrum of visible light. Except pink. Tom Cruise invented pink.' 'The eternal conundrum 'what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object' was finally solved when Vin Diesel punched himself in the face.'Part espionage thriller, and part testosterone fueled race track, the movie starts off in first gear though, with the gang dissipated across the world spending their 100 million heist that they had carried out in Fast Five in their own ways, though a mountain road race between Diesel and Walker portends of things to come. Things shift gears once federal agent Hobbs (The Rock) enlists the help of the Furious gang to bring down a terrorist (Luke Evans) who has skills to match the Furious. An old member of the gang previously presumed dead returns too. The motivations matter little, what matters is that they are loud, ooh-aha inducing and, with the addition of MMA fighter Gina Carano, extremely brutal. And if you thought that the highway mayhem with the tank that is featured in the trailer was the maximum director Justin Lin was attempting, you are so very wrong. He has in store a shattering climax which involves the Furious gang battling the villains in a cargo plane the size of an island, with a dozen supercharged sports cars with harpoons trying to stop it from taking off. What is customary though is the ball of fire in the end, and Diesel walking out of it, unscathed, smiling. Some more homage to the man, then- 'When Vin Diesel goes to donate blood, he declines the syringe, and instead requests a handgun and a bucket.' 'Vin Diesel played Russian Roulette with a fully loaded gun and won.' 'In an average living room there are 1,242 objects Vin Diesel could use to kill you, including the room itself.'Director Justin Lin has conjured up a movie that makes you forget all other F and F ones. Never mind that there is a plot to boot, most of the films budget and time is aptly dedicated to high speed dueling, massive explosions, inspired stunt-work and creative property damage. The actors don't have too much to act about, but you would expect this to be a Diesel, Rock or a Paul Walker movie. But no, it is an out and out Romano (Tyrese Gibson) movie. Every Romano moment is a LOL moment, and he more than makes up for the forced seriousness of the other cast members. Luke Evans as the villain is a bad choice though- he has absolutely no personality in front of these towering hunks, but he does seem to have x-ray vision when he points at Diesel and says 'Look at his face. He is so angry'- meanwhile Diesel remains as impassive as ever. Can't have enough of him?'The word 'lesbian' derives from an old Latin phrase that roughly translates as 'She who has not yet been introduced to Vin Diesel.''There is no theory of evolution, just a list of creatures Vin Diesel allows to live.' 'Vin Diesel once ate the entire cake at a bachelor party before anyone could tell him there was a stripper in it.'Love cars or hate cars, critics and reviews be damned, just go and watch Fast and Furious 6, popcorn in hand. This is a shamelessly entertaining, guffaw inducing, and awe-inspiring thrill ride. Wait till the end though, and we are introduced to what will come in part 7. Perhaps the only real competition in Hollywood to Diesel's racing skills. Any guesses? Or you would rather like to be transported somewhere.10/10",10,17,30,23 May 2013
Bhaag Milkha Bhaag," Epic. Inspirational. Patriotic
","2013 has been a good year for Bollywood with a number of movies finding the right balance between entertainment and art, such as Special 26, Kai Po Che, and Raanjhanaa. But nothing like Bhaag Milkha Bhaag has happened to Bollywood in a long time, maybe not since Chak De India. At once inspirational and believable, there is no way one cannot identify with the pain and the joy of being Milkha Singh, the poster child for India's track and field achievements.One is not born a world class athlete, and the story of Milkha is no different. Who is Milkha Singh? Kudos to Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra for making us care for this question by humanizing the character to the utmost. He tends to blow hot (Rang De Basanti) or cold (Delhi 6, Aks) but here he is red hot.When it is a Farhan Akhtar movie there has to be flashbacks and non linearity, right (Dil Chahata Hai, Rock On, Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara)? The story begins with defeat at Rome Olympics as Milkha repeatedly looks back, and immediately we jump into the reasons for the same in Multan, around partition, as young Milkha, played with exuberance by Japtej Singh is on the run for his life from his parents' killers. Scarred in mind he is brought up by his sister, (a now habitually great Divya Dutt) and straightened from his devious past by the love of his life Sonam Kapoor, and mentored by supportive coaches, Milkha has an arduous path to become the flying Sikh. He might have taken to running just for the extra rations, but his talent, dedication, hard work, and discipline ensures his legacy. This is an out and out Farhan Akhtar movie- he is the heart and soul of it, he is there in every frame. This is a career defining role for him, how much has he grown as a method actor. The amount of effort he has taken to get into the character of Milkha is phenomenal. Right from the look and physique, to the mannerisms and the dressing sense- he is an absolute delight. When he does the bhangra, i bet there are few Sardars who can do it better. The supporting cast comprising of Pavan Malhotra, Dalip Tahil, KK Raina, and Prakash Raj is spot on. The script by Prasoon Joshi has beautifully woven blood, sweat, tears and true grit which makes it such a motivational tale. The music by Shankar Ehsaan Loy is spot on, while the cinematography by Binod Pradhan is excellent.Roger Ebert famously said- 'No good movie is too long and no bad movie short enough'. At 3 hrs Bhaag Milkha Bhaag could have been 20 minutes shorter and still had the same impact, but the extra duration in a way just prolongs the involvement. Bhaag Milkha Bhaag is a stupendous achievement overall. It is a movie and there is over dramatization, but there is a tremendous amount of heart that has gone into it, and hence the indelible impact it leaves- 9/10",9,2,2,20 July 2013
Pacific Rim," Out to blow your minds with its awesomeness!
","Watch out- Pacific Rim is out to blow your minds with its awesomeness. Do you remember the time when as a kid you used to smash action figures and other toys together, imagining momentous battle scenes in your mind? Do you remember Johnny Socko and his flying robot, or more recently- Godzilla? What if the most creatively nerdy director in the world decides to pander the child in you and dish out 2 uninhibited hours of monsters vs robots big bash? The result- a summer blockbuster that stamps out all other blockbusters.'We always thought alien life would come from the stars, but it came from deep beneath the sea. A portal between dimensions in the Pacific Ocean'A speedy prologue sets up the background- the Kaiju are alien monsters that are emerging from a deep sea inter dimensional portal. Using nuclear weapons against them will cause too much collateral damage, so the humans design towering 25 story robots called jaegers (means hunter in German) to take on the kaiju. The jaegers are piloted by two individuals connected neurally through a technology called as Drift, wherein they share memories and experiences. At first the jaeger program is successfully, the pilots gain celebrity status. But the kaiju get bigger and smarter, begin to adapt, and win the battles. The world leaders deem the jaeger program to be a failure and begin to build walls to fortify the coastal cities. Rayleigh (Charlie Hunnam) is a retired jaeger pilot who lost his brother when fighting a particularly nasty kaiju. His commander Marshall Stacker Pentacost (Idris Elba) convinces him to come out of retirement for a last ditch effort to destroy the portal once and for all. His new partner is Mako Mori, an exceptionally talented pilot with a painful past. The movie is about dealing with survivor guilt and moving on after a loss- both Mako and Rayleigh must learn to pilot their robot Gypsy Danger with flamboyance and passion to save the world.No big stars, no introspective or quip happy superheroes, no literary source, not a sequel- how then does Pacific Rim tower over a summer full of blockbusters? Three words- Guillermo del Toro. This vividly imaginative director literally breathes life into the visuals through his eye for detail, and in one fell scoop he has not only resurrected the giant monster genre, but also finally ensured that Hollywood paid homage to Godzilla (rest in peace, Roland Emmerich's 1998 Godzilla!), mashing it up with modern tech-no sheen with visual impact that eschews current Transformerish blurry action in favor of crisp and clear widescreen shots that are mind-boggling in impact, such as when a jaeger clubs a kaiju with an ocean liner, or when a kaiju flies off with a jaeger in its claws only to have itself decapitated mid air with a giant sword. Every frame is beautifully shot- the bone crunching impact when metal meets flesh, or the gorgeous detailing of the robots and monsters. The robots have the personalities and actions reminiscent of their country and pilots- so the one from China is like a little martial art fighter, the Russian is a behemoth brawler, and the Australian looks like a rugby player. The monsters though have been a del Toro trademark all his life, whether it is Pan's Labyrinth, Hellboy or Cronos. You have kaiju of all shapes, sizes and kinds- reptilian, crustacean, insectoid. If one lumbers around like a gorilla, another slithers around like a Chinese dragon, and the biggest one resembles a biblical, horned demon.A movie as loud and bombastic as Pacific Rim does not really leave much scope for acting. Having said that an eclectic cast largely does the job. Charlie Hunnan is serviceable as the lead but plays a clichéd character, Rinko Kikuchi is the emotional core and also brings in the Japanese angle, Idris Elba looks a million bucks and carries himself exactly like the man you want in charge when facing a monster invasion, an over the top Charlie Day and Ron Perlman bring on the requisite laughs.Bridges are destroyed, cities are leveled, and skyscrapers are shattered, and this is even before the opening credits. I could go on and on describing each scene in detail, but there is the thing about beauty- its best seen, not read. Go on and experience a sensory overload for yourself. Call it eye candy, call it popcorn entertainment, call it summer extremism, or simply call it what all movies were always meant to be- glorious fun. Unmissable.",10,4,12,14 July 2013
American Hustle," excellent characters, great script, superb acting
","Most in-famous sting operation? Tehalka of course for us. But for the US, it was ABSCAM in the late 70s, where the FBI enrolled an expert con man to trap corrupt officials, which led to the conviction of a United States Senator, and six members of the United States House of Representatives among others. Enough entertainment in the tale, just needed a little bit of spice to make it stand out, and director David O Russell does just that in colorful style with impossibly crazy characters in American Hustle.'You are nothing to me unless you are everything' - Sydney ProsserIt is 1978, and in this fact-fiction mash-up, con artists Irving Rosenfield (Christian Bale in an almost unrecognizable half-bald hairdo), and Sydney Prosser (a stupendously sexy Amy Adams) are partners and have successfully pulled off loan scams and forged artwork for a few years. Irving is sly and laid-back, Sydney is all smarts, steel and driven- the perfect foil. Scheming FBI agent Richie Di Maso (a stylish Bradley Cooper) catches the pair and agrees to let them off only if they help him make four big ticket arrests. Throw into the mix Irving's unstable wife Rosalyn (a scene stealing Jennifer Lawrence) who is best described by Irving as ' The Picasso of passive-aggressive karate', pretty much hell breaks loose 30 minutes into the film. Shades of Scorsese in Russell's work as the script goes hula hoops as characters begin double and triple crossing each other. All the main characters have are crazy in one way or the other but have one thing in common- they are all losers who think they are winners. The leads do a fantastic job, no wonder all of them have been nominated for the Academy awards. Bale's Irving could not be more different than his Batman. Paunchy, pathetically focused on the final strands of hair on his head, he is kind of a romantic hero caught between his wife and his lover- both being different kind of nuts. Cooper is passionate and ambitious. Adams is the stripper who has reinvented herself as the classy girl, while the beautiful yet unhinged Lawrence is the proverbial spanner. The who is who of Hollywood keep popping in to make things stand out even more. There is comedian Louis CK as a FBI boss, Jeremy Renner trades his bow and arrows for an Elvis pompadour and a gullible corrupt New Jersey mayor, Michael Pena is a Sheikh, and since this is a film that is as much about gangsters as it is about corrupt officials, Robert De Niro has to be there too!Does the end justify the means? American Hustle does not ponder much on morality and corruption. Instead it focuses more on creating delightful characters going bonkers to a witty script to the tune of a dreamy background score (Bee Gees, Sinatra, David Bowie, Santana, Elton John, Chicago). pretty much all that we can ask for from a movie.Must watch- 10/10",10,0,4,16 January 2014
Rush," What a Rush
","Rush is Ron Howard's best up to date, a visceral thrill ride. It is an exceedingly well crafted sports drama movie, that focuses on the rivalry between two distinctly different men in the gladiatorial world that was Formula 1 racing in the 70s.'25 drivers start every season in Formula One, and each year, two of us die. What kind of person does a job like this? Not normal men, for sure. Rebels, lunatics, dreamers... people who are desperate to make a mark and are prepared to die trying'- Niki LaudaIt is 1976, Bernie Ecclestone is yet to take center stage, race car drivers are superstars with low life expectancy and all that is worth looking forward to in Formula 1 racing is the competition between James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Both of them supremely, almost inhuman racing talents, with arrogance to spare. Yet they could not be more different- Hunt's brash style versus Lauda's cool discipline. Hunt's live life to the max philosophy, versus Lauda's switchblade efficiency.James Hunt: The closer you are to death, the more alive you feel. It's a wonderful way to live. It's the only way to drive.Niki Lauda: A wise man can learn more from his enemies than a fool from his friends.Shot in documentary style, Rush does not seek to establish deep human connect, but instead etches out the story of two diverse personalities competing for the same prize. Whose side are you on? Never mind that because even if you do not understand the difference between motor sports and basketball, or even if you are not a petrol head, you will still be enthralled. Rush is a blur of exquisitely choreographed races, a palette of gorgeous cars and women, a fight for racing immortality between two crazies. Ron Howard has been churning out tripe lately (The DaVinci Code, Angels & Demons). Here is back in form in adrenalin pumping style. The pace is snappy, the editing brisk, the soundtrack is racy, and the dialogs memorable. But the most crucial aspect of a gripping conflict was getting the casting spot on. People would believe this is Chris Hemsworth's breakout role, irrespective of recent past involving Norse gods, hammers and other superheroes. While he is great as the bodacious Hunt, it is actually Daniel Bruhl's Niki Lauda who steals the show, creating sympathy for a self absorbed, myopic, rude and an essentially unlikeable person.Who was the better racer- Hunt or Lauda? Does not matter. What matters is Rush is an un-missable movie, and hence is, quote WWE's Road Warriors- 'what aaaaa rush'- 10/10",10,2,4,2 January 2014
Oblivion," Oblivion movie review- beautiful, stylish, fantastic
","Granted Oblivion takes inspiration from countless sci-fi classics,  granted that it lets a larger than life star consume it, granted it  lets visual flair and elegance triumph mind bending probabilities, but  there is no denying the fact that it is one hell of an entertainer, and  probably THE sci-fi vehicle that Tom Cruise wanted all his life,  Spielberg aside.  A long preamble sets the dystopian background- it is the year 2077, and  the earth has been devastated in a war with aliens who destroyed the  moon, thus destabilizing the earth, causing earthquakes and tsunamis.  Nuclear annihilation followed, and as the earth became inhabitable, the  surviving humans moved to Titan, a moon of Saturn, while alien  scavengers still roam the irradiated habitat. They still mine the  earth's resources through giant reactors which are in turn protected by  drones, which are maintained by a pair of technicians residing in a  stylish, minimalistic floating facility in the clouds, with wiped out  memories- Jack Harper (Tom Cruise) and Victoria Olsen (Andrea  Riseborough), who are counting their days to their return to Saturn. Is  this the truth? Who are Jack and Victoria? Why does Jack still have  haunting memories of his past? Are there humans left on earth? Who won  the war?  'Is it possible to miss a place you've never been? To mourn a time you  never lived?'  Oblivion doffs it cap to gems such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, I am  legend, Independence Day, @Moon, Star Wars, Total Recall, The Matrix  and of course, WALLE to create a striking, visually resplendent  feature. Fresh from his Oscar for Life of Pi (film), Claudio Miranda  creates an another unforgettable integration of cinematography and  visual effects- an arresting landscape of desolate beauty pockmarked  with craters and fallen signposts of humanity as we know it, and lush,  unspoiled green valleys. The action is sporadic and effective, not  overpowering, and there is a love triangle that is sensitively dealt  with. Cruise here is playing one of his more affable characters, a  dreamer trying to find out the meaning of his existence, taking direct  inspiration from Sam Rockwell's stellar turn in the Moon. As  revelations unravel, he gets into superstar mode with minimal  fussiness- cool vehicles, check. Weapons, check. Beautiful babes,  check. Mission to save the world, check. Risenborough is superb as the  icy cool, rule following partner, Olga Kurylenko gives grace to an  essentially damsel in distress role, while Morgan Freeman is his usual  solid self in a cameo.   Director Joseph Kosinski gives a graphic novel flair to the  proceedings, and like his previous effort Tron Legacy, gives a solid  bonus in the form of a surging musical score by French band M83.To sum  up, Oblivion may not be terribly original, but it is stylish, well  written and got performances to boot- especially Cruise who is in red  hot form. It may not be a puzzle to solve, but in the immortal words of  Roxette- it's got the look to warrant a trip to the theaters! Go on and  enjoy a summer spectacle.",9,115,185,14 April 2013
Baby Driver," best film of 2017
","Go watch Baby Driver- the best film of the year till date.Baby Driver is a unique movie, creates its own category- that of a heist musical. Yes, you read it right, and let me explain. At its core, Baby driver is as old school as it gets- it is about rollicking car chases and near crazy criminals. Juxtapose that background on the central character, Baby, who is a demon of a getaway car driver, and who views life through music, and there you have a heist musical- an exhilarating experience I must say. No superhero or transforming robot big bashes, just a straight forward stylishly made romantic action comedy running on gallons of nitrous oxide.Was he slow? So what is unique about Baby, played by an excellent Ansel Elgort? He makes remixes out of everyday conversations, and turns his world into music. He is addicted, nay dependent, on music because of his tinnitus condition- he needs to play music to cancel out the continuous ringing in his ears. So director Edgar Wright takes this a step further to make everyday activity a part of Baby's soundtrack. Everything that happens in the movie- a car rushing past, a man typing, a message coming on the phone- will work with the beats, in a fluidic way that is almost impossible to imagine, let alone execute. Hats off to Mr. Wright then.But its not all style, there is tons of substance too. Baby in the past tried to rob Doc (Kevin Spacey), got caught and now is trying to pay off his debt by being the driver for the heists that Doc plans. One last job is what he is due, but once you are in crime, there is no last job so there is that. And then he meets Debora (Lily James), the love of his life, the reason to get out of crime. Do the stars align? Is Baby able to turn a new leaf? Do the lovebirds get to walk away in the sunset? All this to the tune of Jon Spencer Blues Explosion, Bob & Earl, The Beach Boys, Queen, Simon & Garfunkel T. Rex, Beck and many more.The stars do an exceptional job too. Ansel Elgort and Lily James embody an old world chemistry and charisma. Spacey is Spacey- super cool, Jamie Foxx as Bats is scary, Jon Hamm and Eiza Gonzales as lovers in crime are great, while CJ Jones as Baby's foster father brings tons of sensitivity to a 100 mph movie. In fact it is not only about the stars. Every one- the extras, the bits and pieces actors perform like flawless beats in a chart topping soundtrack. Baby Driver is what movies are all about. Awesome music- check. Great plot- check. Excellent direction- check. Superb acting- check. Flaws in the movie- nil. Don't believe? Watch it and find out.",Null,2,7,30 September 2017
Justice League," Strange
","Watching Justice league was a strange experience. On one hand were the expectations- viewing my favorite heroes on screen together was a goose-pimpling experience (give it up Marvel- Superman and Batman put together trumps all your flock). Also, after 3-4 middling ones, and one good movie, this was DC's make or break move. Marvel's big bucks is what DC was after, and true to their style, it was the movie that kind of summarized DC's Phase 1, much like The Avengers did for Marvel back in 2012. So in short, Justice League was a movie that I desperately wanted to like. All DC had to do was to dish out a coherent yet original fare, which may seem simple to imagine given the wealth of material available, but difficult to execute- imagine Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman and you get the idea.The good news- it is a fun movie, mostly. Having two directors may have had its minuses, but it Whedon's addition surely lightened things up. Justice League picks up from where Batman vs Superman ended- with Superman's death. His death left a lasting impact- with Batman reducing his homicidal tendencies, Wonder Woman surfacing, and other metahumans stepping up. At the same time, the world is a place worse off without Superman, with people being afraid- a perfect time for parademons who feast on fear to appear, along with their master, Steppenwolf. Speaking of whom, is one of the movie's many mistakes. Bland, single track and CGI only- this guy the worst comic book villain in recent times. 'No protectors here. No Lanterns. No Kryptonian. This world will fall, like all the others'Steppenwolf is here to steal the 3 mother boxes - one each in Atlantis, Themiscyra and Metropolis, which will help him conquer the world, and terraform it (yet again, DC?) amidst a lot of Mother, Unity mumbo jumbo. In a world without Superman, Batman realizes battling such an alien threat will require a league of superheroes, and goes about assembling his team, and when the team is proved inadequate, the focus shifts to reviving Superman, who understandably, tilts the balance by waving his little finger. But not without letting each of the Justice League members know who the boss is.'I miss the days when one's biggest concern is exploding wind-up penguins.'One of the many joys of watching Justice League is looking out for the easter eggs. Some of the Old Gods feature- Zeus and Artemis, as well as a Green Lantern. Deathstroke makes an appearance, Flash and Superman race, Gorilla Grod, Penguin and Captain Cold are referenced- oh there is so much more! But the flaws are equally many too- bad CGI, inconsistent tonal shifts that is associated with two distinctly different directors, wooden acting from Affleck, and Gadot, and most importantly, poor editing. I really do not understand the 2 hour rule here, as this is a movie that could have been at-least 20 minutes longer to give some more backstory to some of the new characters. More so because it is the new characters who steal the show- nerdy Flash, macho Aquaman, and techie Cyborg. Justice League brings together heroes with a range of powers- mythology, science or as Batman would put it, money based. But unlike The Avengers, where all the heroes had already been introduced in solo movies, this introductory team up feels hurried and inadequate. But then Justice League was never the main event- everybody knew it once the villain was announced. As a build-up though, it works well. Where does the DC Extended Universe go from here though? It is in the right direction at-last I think, but really needs better directors. As for Justice League the movie- depending on the mood in any particular day, viewers are likely to classify it as good or bad. It is a strange movie, as I said at the outset. 7/10",7,0,1,19 November 2017
Man of Steel," An entertaining, adventurous Superman
","It is awfully hard to make a believable movie about a living God, because the very concept of God raises improbabilities, begets so many questions. Superman is blessed with Godlike powers, his is a flawless character, the boy scout in blue and red, the alien who dedicates his life to serving mankind. How did he arrive on his destiny? How did his powers come to being, wax or wane? What does that 'S' on his suit stand for? To me Zack Snyder's Man of Steel is the definitive Superman movie we have all been waiting for, Richard Donner version included, not because of millions of dollars of VFX, but simply because it provides a narrative that quells all prospective questions that may arise. Christopher Nolan's influence is strong here, as this is the Batman Begins of Superman, although the mood is as sombre as it was in The Dark Knight Rises. Delightfully told in a non linear style, it begins far far away, where the highly advanced civilization of Krypton faces annihilation- the planet is dying as a result of the its core being destabilized. Acclaimed scientist Jor El (Russell Crowe) and Lara (Ayelet Zurer) have conceived Krypton's first natural birth in centuries in the form of Kal El, but fail to convince the ruling council the need to preserve the civilization's culture in other planets. Krypton eventually self destructs, Kal El is killed in a military coup by General Zod (Michael Shannon) but he manages to embed the essence of Krypton in Kal El and send him to earth. People might point out the futility of Zod and his cohorts being imprisoned when the planet itself is doomed, but in evolved societies it is expected that the judicial system does not break down even in adverse circumstances. 'You will give the people an ideal to strive towards. They will race behind you, they will stumble, they will fall. But in time, they will join you in the sun. In time, you will help them accomplish wonders.'Gravity is such a wonderful tool to explain superhuman abilities, as Edgar Rice Burroughs pointed out a century back in John Carter. Kal El's powers blossom under the earth's yellow sun, yet he has been taught to hide his abilities by his adopted parents Jonathan and Martha Kent, till the world is ready for him. We see him roaming all around the world, trying to find meaning for his life, and helping people, till he discovers an old Krypton exploratory ship that had landed in earth 18,000 years ago. This serves as his fortress of solitude, where he is finally able to access his father's consciousness that provides answers to his existence, and beginnings to the concept of a Superman. With due respect to a bald genius villain, a Superman movie needs super-powered adversaries- so the second half of the movie provides all the shock and awe you could ask for in an extended confrontation with Zod and his henchmen who want to make a Krypton out of Earth. Superman never kills, but when equally strong wills collide, something got to give, so be prepared to be shocked some more.Zack Snyder may be panned for his previous directorial ventures and here too the movie lacks a sense of humor, but in Man of Steel he is bang on three important things- incredible attention to detail in cinematography and visual effects, a clear and coherent narrative and casting an extremely competent actors in key roles. Speaking of which Henry Cavill makes for an excellent Superman. Shy and confused at first, confidence personified later on- even in the heat of battle he strikes the right balance between darkness and decency. Amy Adams as Lois Lane follows Pepper Potts (Iron Man 3) and MJ Watson (The Amazing Spiderman) in the recent trend of intelligent female characters in superhero movies, not perennial damsels in distress. Michael Shannon as General Zod may not tower physically but is as over the top as comic villains go, and Russell Crowe is sincere as Jor El. Lawrence Fishburne and Diane Lane will have more to do in the sequels, but the real killer casting was Kevin Costner- his bit role as Jonathan Kent is the father we all want in our lives, setting the moral compass in a super powered kid, and gets the most affecting scene in the movie, even if it just might be a wave of the hand. While the overall standard of superhero movies have increased by leaps and bounds in the past few years, filmmakers often forget the basics of superhero movies IE. to get interesting heroes and villains together for a big bash, instead created meandering fare with boring protagonists bereft of entertainment. Has steel finally bested iron then? Maybe not, but calling it a tie would be quite fair, and a pat in the back of sorts. DC comics has taken a page out of Marvel's play-book to make a complex Superman who is also entertaining, adventurous and does not rein in his punches. Bring it on, Darkseid, Doomsday, Brainiac, Mongul and all other scum! 9/10",9,4,8,16 June 2013
Warrior," Warrior is the best movie of the year so far!
","Don't be misled by the name- Warrior is no action movie. It is though, a superlative emotional roller-coaster, inter spaced with the occasional punch or too. In the style of Rocky, this is a combat sport movie, on the lives of two brothers- who set out on different paths that converge in one titanic fight in the ring, and the greatest thing about this movie is that you don't get to pick sides, you root for both of them till the very end.Tom Hardy plays Tommy- an ex-Marine who was a champion mixed martial artist, trained by his father. With the build of a bulldog, he has the personality of a champion too- brooding, confident, and with the capability to finish off his opponents in seconds. But he is also disillusioned, a deserter from the armed forces, and a dipsomaniac too. Joel Edgarton plays Brendan, and he is every bit the proverbial underdog. When he was a kid, his father was never interested in him as he saw more potential in Tom, and we all know how favoritism from parents can make the unfavored sibling feel. And so he always has a point to prove- when his coach tells him that when the moment comes, he will tap out or when his wife tells him that he won't go all the way - it shows in his eyes when he says he will. And yet, Brendan, like most of us, fights best when his back is to the wall. Both the brothers don't talk to each other, and also harbor deep resentments towards their alcoholic father, whom they blame for their mothers death, and for mistreating them. And no one could have played this redemption seeking, guilt ridden yet trying to pull himself together father as Nick Nolte did. In one of the movie's finest scenes, he breaks down in his son's arms reciting Herman Melville, and with that builds bridges too. A surefire Oscar nod for this, I hope.The first half focuses on what all directors aim to do but cant- character development. Little by little insights into the lives of the main characters, what drives them, gives us a glimpse of what drives them towards participating in a global mixed martial arts championship. The second half has some of the most authentically choreographed fight scenes in MMA history, and credit goes to both Tom and Joel for making this look so real- it feels that they have been doing this all their lives, and not only for this movie.Both have contrasting fighting styles- Tom is overpowering, dominating, and attacking, while Joel is fast, stealthy, thinking, absorbs a lot of punishment but gets his foe down in the end- reminds me so much of my childhood WWF hero, Bret 'The Hit-man' Hart. And the one thing common between the two is that none know how to give an inch. So when the climactic, emotion filled final bout between the brothers take place, one of them has to shout repeatedly to the injured other that he loves him, so that he gives up and the fight gets over.The movie is predictable as most sports based movies are- families unite, barriers are broken and champions emerge. But Warrior, in spite of its clichés, holds its own as a powerhouse of a movie. Many Oscars coming the Warrior's way, I say!",10,2,6,25 November 2011
Divergent," deja vu!
","You know how we rate dogs on the intelligence scale? By their ability to obey human commands and perform their predefined roles. In many ways, in muggle or wizard world, this quality of every entity doing their predefined role is man's vision of a perfect society. However, it is in human nature to sacrifice altruism over ambition, and hence the only two factions that will stand the test of time are the oppressed and the oppressor.Divergent is the latest movie adaption of yet another young adult dystopian novel by the same name, written by Veronica Roth. Typical of the genre, it explores themes such as friendship, love, relationship with families and authority figures, diversity and socioeconomic status through a young lead character, Tris Prior, played by Shailene Woodley.'Faction before blood'Sometime in the future, society in Chicago is divided into five factions- Abnegation (selfless), Amity (peaceful), Candor (truthful), Erudite (intelligent) and Dauntless (brave), based on their personalities. Much like the sorting hat, young 16 year old citizens have to undergo a test that defines their fit. While most conform to these factions, there are a few who display characteristics of all the five factions, called Divergents. These folks can think independently, and not according to pre defined norms, which makes them a threat to the social order government, so are usually terminated. Tris is born in an Abnegation family, but her results show that she is a divergent, and to stay alive she chooses Dauntless. And why not. In a slew of drab, the fearless, military faction members are uber chic- get to wear snazzy black, put on cool tattoos, fight peek-a-boo style and get to jump on and off running trains. The initiation and trainings in this faction are severe tests of strength, conviction and courage. All is not well though, as the Erudites and the Dauntless leadership collude to bring down the rule of the Abnegation, leading to a final showdown as Tris struggles to fight for her parents. While the movie by itself is reasonably good, there is a feeling of deja vu. The success of Harry Potter, The Hunger Games, and the Twilight Saga have led to film producers treating young adult fiction movies like stones thrown in the dark, hoping for a hit. There has been more misses than hits. The hits managed to transcend its audience, from young adults to adults. While the film adaptations of the misses- such as The Host, The Mortal Instruments, The Golden Compass, Percy Jackson were made in a way that they appealed to only their fan base.My feelings after watching Divergent were mixed. The good is that it largely eschews spectacle for substance. Considerable amount of time given to develop the characters, and their motives. There is no shortage of grit- the characters embrace the violence gratuitously. But the script is utterly predictable, and that is kind of sad for a movie that is all about being different. No wonder Shailene Woodley is so talked about these days. When she smiles, she lights up the screen. Pity though the script allows her to do it so little. Also, since this is a trilogy, director Neil Burger stays away from giving us three climaxes (one in each movie), rather keeps setting up things for subsequent films, which makes the ending of this movie a bit non entertaining. Strictly popcorn fare. Fans will love it though- 7/10",7,1,2,13 April 2014
Dunkirk," Dunkirk movie review- Stylish (no pun intended)
","To this day, people do not know why Adolf Hitler allowed the Dunkirk evacuation to happen. He has the entire British army pinned on a beach. He had them surrounded, and the Luftwaffe had air superiority in the sky. The U-boats made life hell in the seas, and the British were considering a conditional surrender at that point. But he stopped his advance, he let the British army escape, and the rest we know is history.'We shall go on to the end. We shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.' - Winston Churchill, after the Dunkirk evacuationHistory notwithstanding, Christopher Nolan's Dunkirk is not a war movie in the traditional sense. There are no sweeping armies, grand strategy at play, rousing speeches, intense drama or fierce combat. Instead, it establishes 3 interlinked perspectives, one each an exposition of the 3 essential asks of a soldier at war- resolve, courage and the will to survive.Mark Rylance leads the first theme, where he demonstrates impeccable resolve against the odds to do his bit in the civilian action in the evacuation. Tom Hardy is the courageous Spitfire pilot who selflessly tries to offer protection from the skies, even at the cost of his own freedom. Harry Styles leads a group of soldiers who are, well, just trying to survive. All the three threads play across different periods, in different theaters (land, sea, air) but all converge to one fateful moment.A good war movie is one that makes you hate war itself. Unlike traditional war epics which tries to do that by establishing good and evil sides, Dunkirk tries to achieve that by focusing on realism- the harrowing experience of the combatants. Dunkirk eschews dialogue in favor of visuals- George c scott's opening salvo in Patton might be longer than the entire script of Dunkirk. But Nolan's signature take is all encompassing here- an ominous score by Hans Zimmer engulfs the senses, wide 360-degree shots highlight expanse and impact, IMAX shooting tech makes you feel as if you are a part of the movie, and a mix of stalwarts and fresh faced actors bring in both innocence and class. In a way Dunkirk plays like an atmospheric horror movie. At the same time, the central theme that Nolan has explored in his Batman trilogy is touched upon here too- how do humans react in times of chaos.Is Dunkirk the best film of the year so far? Maybe for die-hard Nolan fans who like his 'different' take on the war movie genre. But somehow it did not click for me the way I thought it would. Maybe because the movie ended just when it was getting engrossing. Maybe it was a bit too economical- run time, script, settings. Maybe because in India we just cannot experience IMAX tech in all its glory. Maybe because I prefer traditional war epics with dialogues and punch lines.Maybe because 19 years on, I am still not over Saving Private Ryan.Let that assessment take anything away from the immersive cinematic experience that Dunkirk is. Just don't look at it as a war movie.",8,3,6,29 July 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spiderman- fly, swing and get positively amazed!
","'The best types of promises are those that are meant to be broken'Superhero movies reached their nadir with the atrocious and mindless Batman and Robin in 1997, which is why the next superhero movie to come out- Sam Raimi's Spiderman in 2002 is remains especially memorable, in addition to it being a great movie in itself. So why make a remake? Is Marvel's comic book chest this threadbare? Or is it a testament to the fact that no matter darkest nights or assembling avengers, Spidey remains one of the most bankable stars, and a seriously capable superhero.You have seen it all, you have read it all, folks- coming of age story where boy becomes spider and spider becomes man, dealing with loss and taking on responsibility. High school kid gets bitten by a radioactive spider and begins to acquire spider-inspired superpowers. That and personal issues conspire to make a vigilante out of this teenager, resplendent in impossibly tight red and blue spandex. The first hour is predictably mushy family stuff, so have some patience, because the second half literally explodes out of the screen with visceral 3D action.Yet that's where the similarity ends, and there are a bunch of things that make this movie to find its own voice. Compared to the 2002 version, this one is a far truer representation of Spiderman and his universe as Stan Lee envisaged. For starters, this is more about Peter Parker than Spiderman, Peter is the face, Spidey is just an act. Its a teenage superhero, so much of the movie takes place in a college. This one is actually the polar opposite of The Dark Knight- nothing heavy handed, mostly light-footed, breezy treatment, with the core being a love story rather than moral corruption. This version attempts to answer a lot many questions that the previous brushed under the carpet- for example, what happened to Peter's parents? How does Spidey get his webs? Where does he gets his super sized brains from? And this Spiderman is THE Spiderman- right out of the comic book downright funny- always ready with the one-liners, not able to take out his kid self whatever situation he may be in. Director Marc Webb who certainly knows how to weave love stories (as shown in his previous outing, 500 Days of Summer) , gives this movie its moments of magic- No upside down kisses, but Spiderman using a mobile phone, the sequence in a crowded train where Peter begins to discover his powers, and him using a web to tell Gwen that he is Spiderman, in addition to the Godzilla inspired climactic showdown with the Lizard where Spidey keeps delightfully improvising just to keep up with a powerful villain were awesome. Unlike wide eyed Toby Maguire, Andrew Garfield with his nervous energy, and a nerdy demeanor, gives his own spin on Peter Parker. Effortlessly charismatic, even a bit of a showoff right from the start, with a slightly reckless attitude- he even takes on the school bully when in a non super-powered state. He is bumbling, awkward, socially inept, but deeply charming. Hell, what a casting coup this is- watch closely, even without his spidey suit, Andrew with his thin frame and gangly arms looks like a spider! Emma Stone as Gwen Stacy is no bimbo and not a perennially damsel in distress as Kirsten Dunst's Mary Jane Watson was, but she is smart, sassy, and sensitive-perfectly complementing our hero. She in terrific form, as the only one who is able to enter the sanctum sanctorum of this confused, gawky teenager struggling to use his powers, and makes him her own, and in so many ways, completing him. Martin Sheen and Sally Field as Uncle Ben and Aunt May are solid, and our very own Irfan Khan plays a small but crucial role in the film.It has its weaknesses though- sometimes it felt the editors went on strike, not in an overtly bad way though, but the movie felt a bit overlong. For all of Sam Raimi's flaws, no one can still question him for making impact in his trilogy, this one though sincere, is less so. Rhys Ifans as Dr Curt Connor whose experiments go wrong and turns into a giant Lizard is serviceable, but not scene stealing as Raimi's Doc Ock and Green Goblin were. And at the end, he is not truly evil, just a kindly soul gone astray.I have a secret to share. When I was a kid, I used to try to get myself bitten by spiders- Spiderman has always been and will remain my favorite superhero- not only because he is vulnerable, but because he always has a knack of seeing the lighter side of things. And unlike other superheroes, his character has not changed according to the whims and fancies of writers. The last Spiderman movie was just 5 years ago, yet this reboot is welcome enough for me just to see Andrew Garfield as the titular character- he is the best Spidey ever, and his act alone is worth the price of admission. From the scheme of things, a sequel seems to be already in the works. But I have had enough of reptiles, is it too much for me to wish for more 'Venom'-ous action? 9/10- Go ahead, take to the air with Spidey- fly, swing and get positively amazed, enjoy with your family!",9,5,13,29 June 2012
The Lego Movie," Enjoyable for anyone who has ever played with toys
","Like it's title track- everything is AWESOME in The Lego Movie. Crafted with more audacity, imagination and humor than all the Transformers, GI Joes and general superhero movies put together, the Lego movie is the first 2014 blockbuster, a quick witted, heartwarming epic adventure of a nobody, who saves everybody.The plot is a parody of a generic dystopian science fiction story (think 1984, Matrix, Star Wars), but in the world that is Legoland, creativity is everything. It is a world of endless ongoing construction, where the better builder you are, the more revered you are. Lord Business is an evil tyrant who wants everybody to follow the rules. Emmet is one such unexceptional block of plastic who does do as he is told, till he is identified as the 'Special'- the one person who can overthrow the dictator and save the Lego-verse from being permanently static to ever changing and inventive. Helping him is action friendly Wyldstyle ( Elizabeth Banks) and the wizard like Vitruvius (Morgan Freeman). Meanwhile, there is a far greater power than Lord Business, called the Man Upstairs here, whose mostly unseen hand plays God in this world.We would think a movie about building blocks will be rigid and limited in expressions, but in the hands of brilliant animators, everything is possible. Everything that you see is constructed from bricks, wheels, gears, and mini figures, even rivers and an angry ocean! And in it plays every conceivable character that is licensed to Warner Brothers studio, given a cinematic twist. So we have a extremely pompous Batman (voiced superbly by Will Arnett) who only works in black or very very dark shades of gray, saving lives but wise enough to decide that when the time is right, it is every man for himself. Superman, Green Lantern and Wonder Woman are there too, in addition to Gandalf, Dumbledore, Abraham Lincoln, Shakespeare and the entire cast of Star Wars spouting hilarious lines. Then there is a transforming pirate called Metal beard, a space cadet empress called UniKitty, (Allison Brie) who is obviously, a cross between an unicorn and a kitten, and the enforcer, called Good Cop/Bad Cop (Liam Neeson) whose swiveling head has a frown on one side and a smile on the other. I could go on and on but then the wackiness is best seen, not read.Quality animation would come to naught without good voice talent. It is here that The Lego movie furthers its excellent standards by getting an ensemble star cast that brings wit, spontaneity, emotion, and all the laughs you could ever ask for. Some of us think animated movies are for kids, but good ones carry messages that ring true for adults too. In the case of The Lego movie, the message is about thinking outside the box. Kids or adults- anyone old enough to play with toys will enjoy this movie- 10/10",Null,0,2,9 February 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Spectacular
","Watching an X-Men movie always felt like putting on a pair of old shoes. They are predictable yet makes for a comfortable viewing. 2011's X-Men: First Class was actually first class, reinvigorating a franchise that had kind of lost its shine. It explored the origins of the mutant superheroes and villains, and a youthful, talented cast multiplied its impact. But what of the actors in the older series? They never achieved any real closure. So out comes Bryan Singer with X-Men: Days of Future Past, which with its past and future backdrop, effectively serves as a bridge between the two different star casts. Two movies for the price of one? Read on.'So many battles waged over the years... and yet, none like this. Are we destined to destroy each other, or can we change each other and unite? Is the future truly set?' – Charles XavierIn the X-Men universe, the future is dystopian. War has erupted between humans and mutants, with the former close to annihilating the latter with their terrible weapon- the Sentinel robots. In addition to shape shifting, the Sentinels unique strengths include locating any mutant, and the ability to absorb and use mutant powers. The mutants do fight back, but it is useless as shown in the first few minutes of the movie. The futility of their actions do highlight the ingenuity of their solution- changing the past, terminator style, to protect the future. The Sentinel robots came into existence on public support because Mystique assassinated its creator, Bolivar Trask, and they gained their shape-shifting abilities from Mystique herself, who was captured. So The Wolverine's consciousness is sent back to his groovy younger self, back in 1973, just before that fateful incident. He has to convince a younger professor Charles Xavier, and Magneto, among others, of the apocalyptic future, and work together to prevent the assassination.The cast is gargantuan- Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Jennifer Lawrence, James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Ellen Page, Shawn Ashmore and Nicholas Hoult reprise their roles with familiarity, while Peter Dinklage as Trask is their pint sized yet towering adversary. The visual effects are spectacular, and for a movie about people with superhuman abilities, the movie though is more about the human in them. The script is witty, the screenplay is tight, the music is apt, and though the premise is ridiculous, anyone stepping into the theater know what X-Men are after all, a figment of our imagination. Despite Jackman's imposing physique, Lawrence's beauty and Fassbender's charisma, to me though the standout character was Quicksilver (comics) played by American Horror Story's Evan Peters, the Marvel version of The Flash. A smarty-pants, super-speed endowed kleptomaniac ('Prison break? That's illegal, you know'), he probably gets the best sequence in the film shot from his perspective in which everything else in the world moves so slowly- a super slow 3000 frames per second round the room shot while he moves at warp speed to rearrange bullet trajectories among other things. Pity though he disappears after that. If I were to nitpick, I think Bryan Singer has committed the same mistake that he did in Superman Returns- for a movie that is touted as an epic battle for survival, the action is too little. Agreed Magneto gets to lift up a stadium among other things, but unlike the action in Avengers, which left a satisfied feeling, I felt a bit cheated here, wanting more.In the end though, X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) is entertaining, absolutely reveres its characters and makes the only truth in comic book world- that anything is possible, believable. 9/10",9,1,1,23 May 2014
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Fan fiction done right
","'I am fire. I am death. I am king under the mountain!'Says a gloriously resplendent Smaug in Peter Jackson's The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug. Cunning, vain, greedy, vicious, and almost invincible, Smaug is brought to life wonderfully by Benedict Cumberbatch, giving personality to a CGI creation, and actually ending up upstaging an excellent movie in itself. Smaug was teased in the first movie, and is the boss in this feature. The face is bestial but so very expressive, the movements graceful yet powerful, and that magical voice- alternating between thundering and coy results in a masterful sequence to savor for the ages, and one that rivals Gollum's 'riddles in the dark' scenes from The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey.Desolation of Smaug picks up right where the first movie ended. The intrepid group of 13 dwarfs led by Thorin Oakenshield continue on their path to the lonely mountain to reclaim their lost kingdom. On the way stands the evil forest of Mirkwood, chasing them are bands of orcs and giant arachnids, and all the other species that they meet- humans, shape-shifters and elves, seem to have reservations about them. So in short, they keeping falling into the frying pan, or the fire. It has been established that Bilbo Baggins is a reluctant hero, but is a hero nonetheless. Time and again he uses Sting, and the 'one ring' to save his friends. From a typically creative face off with giant spiders, to furious barrel chase escape on the river, to a water based city, to finally the fateful encounter with Smaug deep in a labyrinth, there is plenty of action right from the word go. The elves seem to make orc hunting a sport, and the dwarfs prove to be doughty customers themselves.All the actors do a credible job, - Martin Freeman as the peace loving Bilbo grows in confidence and so does the effect of the ring on him, as he begins to secretly enjoy killing. Richard Armitage's Thorin carries himself with the pride that is afforded by royalty, Ian McKellan's Gandalf is as reliable as ever, and Evangeline Lilly's feisty Tauriel brings the much needed female presence in a story full of hairy men. There is plenty of humor inter-spaced throughout, the it is generally a happy movie as the orcs keep missing, and the dwarfs and elves keep hitting. The master of cinematic detail, Peter Jackson, once again engulfs the audience in his version of Middle Earth- a rich vista of swathing natural beauty, and bewitching creatures, successfully making an epic out of a friendly family adventure. Even then, there is this much you can do if you want to make a trilogy from source material which is 300 pages, and like the first movie, some sections do feel bogged down. Hence Jackson takes creative liberties by bringing back one of the most charming characters in The Lord of the Rings Trilogy- Orlando Bloom's Legolas, and introducing a new character, the elf maiden Tauriel. Together they form quite a team, making mincemeat of orc hordes in eye popping style. In the book, Gandalf disappears for no reasons, but here again Jackson tries to link back to the LOTR movies by creating a back story of Gandalf's battle with the Necromancer/Sauron. But nothing quite prepares you for the moment when Smaug opens his eye.'Truly songs and tales fall utterly short of your enormity, O Smaug, the stupendous'It is an enthralling experience that ends on a cliffhanger as Bilbo's sincere attempts to charm Smaug fall flat. The fiery dragon now covered in gold flies off to lay waste whatever he sets his eyes on, pity though it is a one year wait to follow up on this amazing adventure.

The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Christmas came early :)
","The Hobbit movie review- Expectedly good :)The year has been sad till date- recessions, fiscal cliffs, unemployment, inflation, and the Mayan predicted doomsday 5 days away. but tell you what, all that does not matter anymore- i am spectacularly happy grinning ear to ear, because The Hobbit not only makes me forget it all and look forward to a better year, even Christmas came early for me, thank you Peter Jackson. Naysayers be damned but if there was one complaint i had with the Lotr trilogy, it was that large tracts from the book went missing in the film in addition to key figures like Tom Bombadil and Glorifindel- if Potter could stretch to 8 movies, am sure there was enough in Tolkien's magical universe to spawn more than 3 films. it was deep, dark and complicated enough. The Hobbit though is a shorter, less heavy handed and less epically epic adventure- essentially a children's fairy tale involving a group of dwarfs along with a wizard and a hobbit on a treasure hunt, and the beauty of this is that nothing gets omitted from the book, and all the characters are well fleshed out.'Bilbo Baggins, I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure'- After a 10 minute prologue which effortlessly sets up the world and sucks us in to the story, the movie takes from where the Fellowship of the Rings started, and then goes back 60 years when a young non adventure seeking and home loving Bilbo Baggins is forced by Gandalf to join 13 dwarfs on a quest to recover their lost kingdom Erebor, which was taken over by a fearsome dragon, Smaug who is best described as ' a furnace with wings'. Led by the warrior dwarf Thorin, the Aragon of this story, who is brave but does not often makes the soundest of decisions, this ragged bunch has to battle through every creature abounding Middle Earth including trolls, orcs, goblins, wargs, and rock giants on their quest. At the same time, this is where the fated 'one ring to rule them all' appears- there is evil brewing in the East, Sauron is rising and the elders are choosing to disbelieve. And Gollum is scene stealing- yes sir, Andy Serkis as the schizophrenic Gollum is back and his scene stealing cameo where he engages Bilbo in a game of riddles and loses his 'precious' is worth the price of admission- both tense, and funny. The WETA digital folks have again delivered a stunning film- the imagery, photography and digital work is worth of JRR's imagination. Howard Shore gives another goose pimpling score, and New Zealand never looked so beautiful, like ever. Peter Jackson again proves that only he can do justice to us Tolkeinites- this is a winning formula of expanding prose to stunning cinematic visual, executed with great Ã©lan once again. The star cast is largely excellent, guest appearances by Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, and Hugo Weaving as rock solid, while Ian McKellen, though he looks like he can barely stand, completely owns the character of Gandalf, in addition to an excellent Martin Freeman as Bilbo. Swathes of dwarf make-up cannot take away the beauty of Richard Armitrage as Thorin, and like Sauron in the Fellowship, all we see of Smaug is one fiery eye.Orcs, battles and plenty of back-story- The Hobbit is mesmerizing in its own way then- it successfully transports you to Middle Earth, the scale and context are not as universe shattering as they will be later on, but then the tale is a lot more innocent and intimate. No grand stand battles, but more edge of the seat excitement. The script is funny, there treatment is familiar- and the result? More of the same that we have always loved. Great family fun and looking forward to the next two parts. Thanks again, Peter Jackson! 10/10",10,3,12,16 December 2012
Non-Stop," thrilling ride at 40,000 feet!
","Old man Liam Neeson does it again. His hulking energy and imposing screen presence makes Non-Stop an excellent action thriller. At 61, post Taken, Neeson is enjoying his second lease of Hollywood stardom, and his first as an action star. Seems his purple patch has no end in sight.Non-Stop is a murder mystery much in the vein of an Agatha Christie novel, set 40,000 feet in the air, within the confines of an aircraft. Neeson plays Bill Marks, a down in the dumps US Air Marshall who takes to the bottle whenever he can to overcome his perpetual grief over the loss of his daughter. When at work in a non-stop flight from New York to London, he suddenly starts receiving threatening text messages demanding $150 million. Failure to meet the demand means someone in the flight would be killed every 20 minutes. The person making these demands seem to know Marks well, at the same time looks like he is sitting in the plane itself. Bodies start to drop, and when Marks tries to find out the killer, he finds out that he is being set up. The airplane offers a wide array of characters- a drug dealing fellow Marshall, a NYPD cop, Julianne Moore's chatty friendly co-passenger, an Arab doctor, and a mobile software expert, among others. It is a claustrophobic scenario, and committing murders in front of everyone borders on the impossible. The magic of Non-Stop, then is to make all this believable. Director Jaume Collet-Serra who has established himself with the 2009 horror flick, Orphan, and has directed Neeson earlier in Unknown, has shot 95% of the film is within the confines of an airplane, but he does so with style and pace, including a manic fight in a lavatory and a crazy emergency landing. He knows his star well, and uses his appeal to the max. As the gruff, flawed, and increasingly desperate hero- Liam Neeson currently has no equal. As the movie progresses and his character's tragic past is revealed, it comes to light that he will actually do anything it takes to save the people on the flight. There are a lot of loopholes in the plot, but the thrill, intrigue, suspense, action and a star in full flow makes Non-Stop a highly recommended film- 8/10",8,0,1,28 May 2014
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Unadulterated joy
","How To Train Your Dragon 2 is every bit as entertaining and endearing as the original. Refreshingly for a sequel, it is not necessarily bigger and brasher, but feels like an extension of How To Train Your Dragon. Set 5 years after the events of the first film, the script has grown up too, very much like its enchanting lead characters- Hiccup and Toothless. At the same time, it is human creativity to the max- a superb 3D fantasy ride that will leave you breathless.'This is Berk,' Hiccup says. 'Life here is amazing. Dragons used to be a bit of a problem. But now they've all moved in.'In a world of temperamental dragons and unreasonable humans, patient and reasonable Hiccup and non fire breathing Toothless were both misfits. Yet their relationship changed the world- this we saw at the end of the first movie. This one starts off in thrilling style, with Hiccup's friends engaging in a juvenile dragon race, which is a cross between basketball and buzkashi. Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) however, prefers prosaic activities such as skimming with the whales, trying his hand at gliding, and in general running away from the leadership role that his father, Stoic the Vast (Gerard Butler), wants him to don. In one of his expeditions, he comes across a vast horde of dragons, and meets the source of his dragon whispering skills- his long lost mother, Valka (Cate Blanchett). Toothless meanwhile is no longer a pet, he and Hiccup are but one soul. There is a power hungry villain, Drago (Djimon Honsou) in the horizon though, who wants to build and commandeer a dragon army. Hiccup and Toothless must overcome personal loss and fight their heart out to save what they have so painstakingly built.The magic of How To Train Your Dragon 2 is the way director Dean DeBlois is able to create a mood of intimacy and awesomeness. First the visuals- the dragon flying scenes are absolutely marvelous- dragons soar, swivel, dive and spit fire in enthralling fashion. The action sequences are full of subtle gags that require a second viewing to fully appreciate, and the imagination and detail that has gone in the design of a million dragons on screen is mind-boggling (no two dragons are the same). Then the emotive elements- there are genuinely scary moments, major characters have to deal with death and treachery, and there is a rekindling of a love story between people long lost. The visuals and the emotions come together with rare fluency to create a joyful, immersive 3D experience. The voice acting by all the stars is very good too, in addition to the racy musical score.Children will most likely be immersed in all the visual frenzy, but will also ask questions- this is a film that will make them think too. At the heart of every animated movie is the message. Here it is about the symbiotic relationship that humans have with animals, and the thought that we need to make our own destiny.

Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Mission Accomplished with Honors
","The first scene of Mission Impossible 4 features the niftiest spy gadget ever- a pellet sized object, which, when it hits the ground becomes a full size mattress to cushion the impact of a 50 feet fall, also allowing the opportunity to the agent to take down assailants during the fall. You know from that scene on that you are in for a very special 'cruise'. Apologies for the pun, but Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol is an impossibly fast film, so much so that the first time you get to time to think is around the halfway mark, when Tom Cruise successfully scales up and down the world's tallest building, manages to switch diamonds and nuclear codes, takes on a sandstorm of epic proportions only to let his nemesis slip out of his hand. While we all saw this coming as there were more minutes to the movie, what is special here is the relentless, adrenalin charged pace.The plot's wafer-thin and incredulous itself- a demented Hendricks (played by Michael Nyqvist), wants to annihilate the world so that it can start all over again, and hence is in earnest need of some nukes. And all that stands between his quest and world obliteration is Ethan Hunt and his cronies. And what a fun gang is this one- Tom Cruise might have been stereotyped earlier in his career as a chocolate hero, but this series has infused fresh life in him, making him a stupendous action star despite his diminutive proportions. Even at 50, he proves he can give the young upstarts a run for their money with his kicks, punches, and manic chases. Paula Patton's Agent Jane is chameleon-esque- deadly one moment, and sexy vixen the other. Simon Pegg's Benji keeps all of us smiling, while brooding Jeremy Renner maybe an Academy Award nominated star, but here he does let down his hair a bit in the second half to go with the unbelievable flow. The world is the playground for our heroes as the movie, which starts at Budapest, involves a jailbreak somewhere in Russia, an explosion in Kremlin, a lengthy chase sequence on top of the 830 mts Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, climaxes somewhere unnamed that the director wants us to believe is India, and ends quietly in the US.'Blue is glue and red is dead', says Benji as he hands over a pair of spiderman gloves to Cruise for a gravity defying, heart in the mouth stunt sequence in the movie, which perhaps bests all in 2011. In fact the entire movie is a showcase for technology- cool gadgets, prototype BMWs, and adds a heady concoction of action in the form of death-defying stunts, fisticuffs, martial arts displays, gunfights, car and foot chases.Which brings us to the weaknesses- as in most Hollywood action thrillers, everything is sacrificed at the altar of entertainment, with plans and super-plans executed to perfection with impeccable timing, and things going wrong only when the director decides to make life slightly difficult for our intrepid heroes. Anil Kapoor's 'Hollywood' purported career defining role is perhaps the worst role he has taken up in his stellar resume, its worse than his turn in Tashan ;) And why the need of the India angle is any of the scenes were not going to be shot here? But the biggest flaw would be casting a dramatic actor of Nyqvist's stature in a pure action villain role. Check his intensity out in the Millennium trilogy and you will see what I mean.Director Brad Bird has incredible credentials indeed, for afterall he directed the Pixar superhit The Incredibles, in addition to the charmingly funny Ratatouille, and what his animation background brings to the table is vivid imagination, so useful in filming the spellbinding action sequences.To round off, Mission Impossible 4 is not only perfect weekend fare, by shaking and stirring some Bond and Bourne, it raises the bar for big budget action thrillers...Don't fiddle away your time this weekend, go watch,MI-4 and thank me for it later :)",8,2,7,17 December 2011
Avengers: Infinity War," How soon can Thanos return?
","Avengers: Infinity War was 10 years in the making. Every MCU movie since 2008 hinted at this eventual end game. The ultimate, cosmic showdown between the entire assembly of heroes, and an all powerful villain. Fans have been waiting for this, Marvel has been building up the MCU for this. Given the genocidal backstory, the challenge for Marvel though was to make a different kind of movie, yet remain faithful to it's brand of film-making, which it actually manages to do well.So planets are destroyed, and Asgardians liquidated even before the movie begins, while much loved characters soon start getting killed off 5 minutes into the movie. At long last, a villain takes front and center in a Marvel movie. For the last 10 years, Thanos has sent his underlings to collect the Infinity Stones. This time round, he is doing it on his own. The best part about Infinity War is that it is more about Thanos and less about the Avengers and Guardians. Unlike the comics, where Thanos wanted to eradicate half of all life in the universe to win his love, Lady Death, in the MCU, Thanos has a Malthusian hangover. He passionately believes his actions are imperative to save the universe, and goes about doing what he needs to do, methodically, even though it extracts a terrible price on everybody, including himself.Thanos: Daughter.
Gamora: Did you do it?
Thanos: Yes.
Gamora: What did it cost?
Thanos: ...Everything.So how did the Russo brothers sprinkle the Marvel formula in a movie that is all about death and destruction? First of all, they spread the action across half a dozen locations across the universe- Wakanda, Knowhere, Vormir, Nidavellir, New York and Titan. Then they broke up the heroes into disparate groups, and allowed their emotional connects and comic timings to take over. Other than probably Thor, Iron Man and Dr.Strange, most of the other heroes get a raw deal in this 2.5 hour ensemble set up. Even then, for them, these roles are but their second skin, and they do a great job, as expected. The result is a massive thrill ride, with it's own emotive moments.At the end though, even when severely wounded by Thor, Thanos snaps his fingers, and half the universe is obliterated. As far as the Avengers go, only the original core team (Captain America, iron Man, Hulk, Thor, Black Widow, and I assume, Hawkeye) remains in existence. Come May 3rd 2019, will it be one last mission for them? Will the Infinity War duology be like the masterful Kill Bill series- the first one being all slam bang, the second a more intimate take? Who knows given that Captain Marvel is teased, and we have seen Adam Warlock last year. And as for those who seemingly no longer exist- Spiderman, Black Panther, Guardians etc- fret not. They all have sequels lined up in the next couple of years.To sum up, Infinity War delivers a fantastic experience- on this scale, mixing action, imagination, humor and drama with a villain who you can almost sympathize with. The latter though is Infinity War's greatest triumph. I will need therapy to wait for Thanos's return.Avengers Disassembled. For now.

The Lion King," dreamy visuals, nothing else
","'Nostalgia is a file that removes the rough edges from the good old days'- Doug LarsonFinding joy in nostalgia when it comes to movies is rather easy. The sense of growing up with characters, and having them influence the person that you may have become is such a strong sentiment. These memories cannot be taken away, and that is true for the Lion King remake.The 2019 Lion King version is impressive- the painstaking efforts that have gone into making the visual effects come alive are to be experienced. In 2019, going gaga over visuals effects is pretty much passe, but still The Lion King is downright astounding. The thing is that beyond the visuals, there is little else that it adds to the original, which in my humble opinion, was a seminal movie. The script, music, the voice acting, the traditional animation remains unparalleled till date.Replace traditional animation with modern live motion capture, and the 2019 version is a shot for shot remake of the 1994 original. All the animals assemble as Simba is born, and as he grows up with his best friend Nala, Mufasa explains to him the circle of life. Scar plots with the hyenas to kill Mufasa, and Simba is chased out of the Pride Lands. He meets Pumba and Timon and grows up with them leading a hakuna matata life, till Nala comes to get him back to his rightful place as king. Scar gets his comeuppance and Simba completes the circle of life when his newborn cub is presented to the assembled animals.Had it been a National Geographic special, there would have been no equal- please take that as a compliment, Lion King. However, even with a stellar voice cast with James Earl Jones reprising Mufasa 25 years on along with Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Beyonce, John Oliver and Chiwetel Ejiofor, Elton John's all-time classic songs, the movie lacks the emotional impact that the original was able to create. Call it corporate greed, lack of creativity and artistry or just plain laziness- nostalgia notwithstanding, it brings nothing new to the table. Director Jon Favreau did a much better job with 2016's The Jungle Book, which, in my mind is one of the best live action remakes ever.But hey, whatever Disney touches these days turns to gold. The Lion King will might make a few billion for sure, and kids will surely enjoy this round too, but Simba's roar is decidedly low this time round.",7,2,6,22 July 2019
The Bourne Legacy," Does not let spectacle erode substance, or style destroy thought
","The Bourne series (comprising of 2002's The Bourne Identity, 2004's The Bourne Supremacy, and 2007's The Bourne Ultimatum) redefined the spy movie genre- first up it was one of the few movies to be better than their source material (Robert Ludlum's books were not a patch on the films), it created a heady concoction of realism with fantasy, along with edgy action sequences, a believable hero and crucially, topped it all off with an apt ending- no wonder they made over a billion dollars at the box office. And yet again, 5 years down the line- we have a reboot/sequel, whatever you may call, but i think the word that best fits The Bourne Legacy is sidequel- there is NO Bourne, just some vague references...it takes place in a time-line overlapping the events of The Bourne Ultimatum, and introduces a new central character in addition to tying in lines from the previous movies. Is the movie any good? Or more importantly, was the sidequel necessary? The basic plot is not largely different from its predecessors. Bourne's public revelations at the end of The Bourne Ultimatum have had far ranging ramifications- all government secret soldier programs are being hastily shut down, active agents and scientists associated with those programs are being mercilessly exterminated. But come what may, one of them refuses to be put down- Alex Cross, played by Jeremy Renner is a different kind of Bourne. His super soldier routine requires active medication- and the blue/green pills that he takes give him almost superhuman strength, pain resistance, agility, and acumen. Alex survives his assassination attempt to unite with Dr. Marta Shearling (Rachel Weisz) who can help him remove his dependency on the pills yet keep his enhanced skills. The rest of the movie is one long across the world chase sequence, where Alex and Marta pool in every skill at their disposal to stay ahead of the wolves, both the howling type and the tech laden ones, led by Edward Norton's Eric Byer.The good things first- fans of the original Bourne series will surely be satiated- Jeremy Renner is an excellent replacement to Matt Damon. The first sequence in Alaska sets up interesting traits of his character- he is smart, resourceful, curious and a does not hesitate in giving it back (' You should have left me alone'- he says to an insistent wolf while popping in a GPS tracker down its throat). Renner 110% looks the part and plays it with both charisma and sincerity. The Hurt Locker, Mission Impossible 4, The Town, Avengers- seems he is the go to guy for action movies currently, and he delivers excellently too. So often people get the damsel in distress wrong, but age has only made Rachel Weisz prettier and experience, a better actor. She is utterly believable as a scientist out of her depth and on the run. Even though there isn't an explicit romantic angle, the chemistry between Renner and Rachel is sizzling. Like Denzel Washington, Edward Norton's mere presence in any movie makes it a couple of notches better. Essentially the villain and passionately convicted to the cause, he is underutilized here, but even then manages to add a touch of class. The action sequences are right up Bourne's alley- raw, electrifying, and the climactic rooftop- bike-top chase sequence will surely go down as one of the greatest ever, there are a couple of suspenseful scenes as well- none better than when a scientist goes berserk in an utterly cold and calculated way. The dialogs are concise, and the soundtrack catchy.It has its share of imperfections though, the movie at 136mins feels too long- there are segments which tend to drag and would have worked better with some editing. This is also not for people not familiar with the series as it picks up directly from the previous movies, and so there are humongous sections tossing out lingo such as Treadstone and Blackbrair that will be understandable to dedicated followers of the series. Plus, though the action was good, i would have wanted a bit more of it. Tony Gilroy wrote all the previous Bourne movies, and directed this one, and while his script is top notch, the direction, though competent, could have been better- the plot is simple enough but the attempt to link it with the Bourne of yore is a bit confusing.In retrospect, this movie is kind of like passing of the baton- while the ending was open enough, reboots/remakes are always about money and box office success will determine whether there is a Bourne 5 or not- whether Cross or Bourne work together, or against or fly solo. Unlike recent CGI special action flicks such as Total Recall, The Bourne Legacy does not let spectacle erode substance, or style destroy thought- it takes time to pick up speed but once it does, its one hell of a ride, besides the fact that it fulfils what 99% of the audience want ie. to see beautiful people do exciting things. 8/10- remember to take the popcorn!",8,2,6,14 August 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," good, not great
","Spiderman, Spiderman, Does whatever a spider can Spins a web, any size, Catches thieves just like flies Look Out! Here comes the Spiderman. We all love this theme song from the Spiderman TV series. Apparently, Spidey loves it too, so much that it is his ring-tone in The Amazing Spiderman 2. As like the previous film, Andrew Garfield's Spiderman is straight off the comic books- lissome, smarty pants, witty, and affable, everyday hero. The people's hero. But is it his greatest battle? Not really, even though he had to stop Electro, Green Goblin and the Rhino, all in the same movie. Like most superheroes, Peter Parker's struggles are within himself, to balance his obligations for his friends and family and his extraordinary responsibilities to New York City as Spiderman. With the back-story kind of done with in the first movie, director Marc Webb does not waste anytime but cuts straight to the chase. And chase it is in a breath- taking sequence as Spiderman saves bystanders, cops, foils a plutonium robbery while talking mushy with Gwen Stacy, at the same time. Things are not all hunky dory though, with Peter consumed with guilt over the possibility of Gwen being exposed to his adversaries, and his continued disturbance over his parents' disappearance. Adding to the volatility is the origin of his perhaps his most popular foe, Electro, and the emergence of Peter's best friend Harry Osborn.First the good- it is a great thing whenever Spidey is suited up. For when he does, he is either inducing guffaws with his one liners, or taking us on a roller coaster ride with his slow motion acrobatics and creative uses of his web-slinging capabilities. Andrew Garfield is a GREAT Spiderman, full of joi de vivre. Radiating nervous energy and childish enthusiasm, his chemistry with Emma Stone's Stacy is excellent. The visual effects are amazing, and the villains are suitably over the top, with Jamie Foxx's Electro getting maximum screen time, a hilarious Paul Giamatti as Rhino, and Dane DeHaan who turns into the murderous Green Goblin by the time you blinked. New Yorkers seem to love a show clapping and cheering their hero, and like a pro wrester, a show it is that Spidey gives them, every time a maniac pops up. People familiar with Spiderman canons will know the fate that awaits Gwen Stacy and so the rest of the movie plays out like a sappy teen romance drama, and largely a popcorn affair.The bad- there is too much happening. Two is company, three is a crowd. Three villains is an overkill, though in deference, Rhino just makes a special appearance in this, promising more in the next film. The narrative suffers from being the second movie in a planned trilogy, as a result it asks more questions than it answers. What is up with Richard Parker? What secrets will the hidden laboratory hold? Who is the man in the hat? Why is Oscorp the center of all mayhem? There is a deluge of superhero films, and I have a feeling The Amazing Spiderman 2 will get lost in the crowd, because it is good, but not great. No worries though, redemption coming right up in 2016, and villain list is set to include the Rhino, Vulture and Doc Ock- 7/10",7,1,5,1 May 2014
1917," Best picture of 2019
","No wonder 1917 is getting awards by the truckloads- it is a fine war movie. Not only because it makes you abhor war, like every good war movie does. Also because it is without being overtly gritty, a very realistic portrayal of those lowest in the pecking order- the infantry-man. And also for the fact that technically- it is a marvel.It is also a very different kind of war movie. Thank god to the title, it did not need a prologue, or any character build up. We straightaway jump into the odd mix of silence and mayhem that trench warfare was in the First World War. We learn that the Germans have made a strategic withdrawal and are waiting to pounce on unsuspecting British forces chasing them, with the obvious mcguffin being telegram wires cut. The task of stopping the pursuing British forces from attacking the artillery reinforced Germans falls upon two Lance Corporals- Blake and Schofield, and they literally have to go through hell to succeed. Shades of another war epic from Spielberg I say, along with some inspiration from Tolkien of course.'They're walking into a trap. Your orders are to deliver a message calling off tomorrow morning's attack. If you fail, it will be a massacre'The plot is based on a true story told by director Sam Mendes' grandfather. And Mendes goes all in to make 1917 an experience like no other. For people unfamiliar with WW1, a large part of the war was fought through two opposing trenches- the land between them known as No Man's land. Last time we saw No Man's land in a big budget mainstream release, it was Wonder Woman's launch pad. Grim, but still comicky. In 1917, the opening tracking shot has to be admired not only for the authenticity of the sets, but also the way Mendes is able to show change in attitude and morale of the soldiers as we get closer to the trench frontline. No man's land is hell itself though- dead horses with files buzzing around, dead soldiers hung up on fences or caked in the mud, craters that much rather be euphemistically called death pits, prowling aircraft waiting to machine gun stragglers, and the rats that are constantly feasting on still festering bodies- there is death everywhere even if the enemy has long left.'You are in no man's land. Which never moves, which never changes, which never grows older, but remains forever, icy and silent.'Blake and Schofield somehow make it through initially because they have each other. The loss of Blake at midpoint in addition to what he has already experienced strengthens Schofield's resolve further as he is on a race against time. And all throughout there are scenes that pay homage to past war classics- the encounter with a German sniper is reminiscent of Enemy at The Gates, the touching moment with the baby calls out to Ayer's 2014 tank classic -Fury, while the knife battle in the shadows again doffs its hat to Saving Private Ryan. It is to Mendes' credit that he makes Schofield's Frodo like journey believable till the end, even as he put his life one final time by sprinting through the battlefield to prevent the homicide.The two main leads do not have come with loads of experience, but they do an excellent job. Pity that the script did not allow for a Game of Thrones reunion. In fact this is perhaps the only film in 2019 where everything comes together in a perfect symphony- music, cinematography, realistic sets, CGI, acting and the script.The list of Oscar nominations for 1917 is a testament- Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, Best Original Score, Best Sound Editing, Best Sound Mixing, Best Cinematography, Best Makeup and Hairstyling, and Best Visual Effects. The best part is that unlike Joker, this is no award baiting movie. This just has a honest story to tell, and Mendes tells that with honesty and style, and that is why it is my pick for all the awards it has got nominated for.This is a mesmerizing movie. Technically brilliant, and shot in a way that kind of immerses the viewer the way Dunkirk never could. Sorry Nolan.Here is a bet- watch the movie, and if you are not running in your mind as Schofield makes his final dash, I will pay for your ticket.",10,8,12,25 January 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Compelling watch!
","We met Luke Skywalker 40 years ago in Star Wars: A New Hope, and while many thought fan favorite Hans Solo would be the central character of the trilogy, it was actually Luke's journey that formed the crux of the original trilogy- from a peasant to a rebel and then to a Jedi. He defeated the Empire back in 1983 and disappeared, only to make an appearance in 2015's Star Wars: The Force Awakens, as the last Jedi. Or not?The Last Jedi picks up from where the Force Awakens ended- Rey meets Luke and wants him to teach her to master the Force, while Leia evacuates the Resistance base in spectacular fashion, as the First Order forces chases them. Both of them are unlucky though- Luke grieves over his failure in teaching Kylo and so has lost his faith in the ways of the Jedi. And Leia loses a huge chunk of her fleet in the initial First Order attack, and is incapacitated later on.The Rebel forces are on the run, and Poe Dameron and Finn devise an alternate plan to escape from the clutches of the First Order. Meanwhile Kylo and Rey develop a telepathic connection which leads to a confrontation between them that has drastic results for everyone, including Snoke. At the same time, a movie titled The Last Jedi has it's final act devoted to the supposed Last Jedi, as Luke finally appears, and lights the spark that keeps the Resistance alive. Star Wars: The Last Jedi is probably the best of all Star Wars movies. It has the right mix of humor, emotion, and action. Light saber duels, X-wing dogfights, messy relations- it is all there. Director Rian Johnson clear direction almost makes it difficult to choose between the dark side, and light. It is impeccably paced, and all the actors do a great job while they are at it. Some of the newer characters are fleshed out- Daisy Ridley, Adam Driver and Oscar Isaacs are rousing. And Mark Hamill gives the performance of his lifetime, and keeping up with the theme of old giving way to the new, gracefully relieves himself from the series, even though we expect him to appear Yoda like in future.It is not all perfect though- the movie is too long, there are plot holes, unanswered questions and questionable logic, and similarities with The Empire Strikes Back abound, but at the end of it, we are left at a far brighter place than The Empire Strikes Back. Change is the only thing that is constant. This is Star Wars, for this generation. And the good news for fans is that there seemingly is no end to the story",9,0,4,17 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Simply Marvel-lous
","Guardians of the Galaxy- Simply MarvellousYes it is a movie of cosmic proportions, an inter-planetary fantasy of epic scale. Yes it has a team of underdogs taking down a Goliath. Yes it has a talking raccoon and a tree as main characters. But what makes Guardians of the Galaxy the best Marvel movie of all times is the fact that it is the closest embodiment of the Marvel comic book ethos- full of wit and charm, spunk and fun, and of course, action.Sample this- somewhere in the universe, in a desolate planet with incessant water fountains, where a once proud culture reigned. A masked man lands in a spaceship, and charts out a path through the devastated surroundings. At one point, he puts on a Walkman, switches on Redbone's 'Come and Get Your Love' and breaks into an impromptu jig. He is in some mood. On his way he encounters small dinosaur like creatures that he either footballs them or treats them as microphones, karoakaying his way and leaping across mortal dangers to steal an Infinity gem, as the credits start to roll. Marvel fans would be aware that the stone is one of the most powerful objects in the universe. This effortless boogey sets the tone for the movie- an irreverent take on universe shattering events.Unlike the Avengers, since the characters are all new, but even more bizarre, they do need a round of formal introductions-'Star-Lord, man, legendary outlaw. Forget it' - Peter QuillPlayed in zany style by Chris Pratt, Peter Quill was kidnapped from earth when he was a child by a gang of bounty hunters. Today he is a galaxy trotting thief and space scavenger who likes to call himself Star-Lord. Tremendously attached to his mother's music, Quill is a Romeo who has survived in this cutthroat profession so far solely because of his improvising skills.'I am a warrior, an assassin. I don't dance' - GomoraActed by Zoe Saldana (this time in a shade of green), Gomora is an adopted daughter of Thanos, surgically enhanced into a killing weapon. Gomora is exactly what she says, but learn to dance, she does, courtesy Star-Lord.'Nothing goes over my head! My reflexes are too fast, i would catch it'- Drax, the DestroyerPlayed by WWE star Dave Bautista, Drax is a naive to the point of stupidity, suicidal, tattooed mountain of a brute with a love for knifes matched only by his thirst for violence. He specifically seeks revenge on Thanos and Ronan, who he holds responsible for the death of his family. 'Ain't no thing like me, except me'- Rocket RaccoonCouldn't be more true. Rocket is like no other thing. Motion captured and voiced in scene stealing style by Bradley Cooper, Rocket is a genetically altered, cybernetic-ally enhanced raccoon with a thing for sarcasm. Happiest when with a big gun and Groot by his side, he is also a master tactician and the technical whiz kid in the team.'I am Groot' - GrootPerhaps the most emotive role ever essayed by Vin Diesel- Groot is an ever growing humanoid plant whose vocabulary is limited to three words. Serves as the muscle for Raccoon with whom he has kind of a telepathic connection.Also in the mix are even zanier characters- Xondu (Michael Rooker), the bounty hunter that trained Quill and was later double crossed by him, carries an arrow that would have changed the course of the Mahabharata battle, the super-villain Thanos (Josh Brolin) who we will see more of in future Marvel productions, Lee Pace as the fearsome, maniacal Ronan the Accuser- a Kree warlord with blind hatred for Xandarians, and Benicio Del Toro as The Collector- an ancient alien. 'We are all standing, a bunch of idiots standing in a circle' The Guardians are an anonymous, friendless lot. They have all been scorned and have suffered loss. Till they come together as a team to defend the planet of Xandar and its 12 billion people against Ronan, they have never known a family. The movie is a VFX extravaganza with superlatively detailed action sequences, but at the same time director James Gunn draws effectively from established scifi franchises such as Star Trek and Star Wars to create an emotional and expressive tale, while at the same time endowing it with oodles of self deprecating humor. The script is a belly full of laughs, the soundtrack is as it claims- awesome, and the acting by all, though caricatured, is top class. The end product is a an amazingly imaginative, visually stunning, frothy, lively, light hearted 'save the universe' romp that wows with its dazzling visual style and at the same time keeps tickling your funny bone. Cannot recommend enough- 11/10",10,15,23,10 August 2014
Evil Dead," high on gore, low on scares
","The gold standard for horror fans all over the world till this date is still the troika of The Evil Dead, The Omen and The Exorcist. The Omen remake could not hold a candle to the original, and to be frank, I was not looking forward to the Evil Dead remake because I never thought anyone could do justice to Sam Raimi's brilliance, Bruce Campbell's class act and the seamless manner in which the movie blended horror with black humor. Having said that, the 2013 Evil Dead remake has its own strengths in relentlessly gratuitous levels of violence and is a worthy homage in itself to a classic- the basic plot remains the same, with 5 youngsters trapped in a cabin with a demon raising book for company. Teenage curiosity is often the staple for the existence of the horror film genre- the demons rise, possessions take place and each of them get to die in imaginative ways. Gore lovers rejoice as there is plentiful to look forward to as director Fede Alvarez shows his creativity where it counts. Dismemberments, burnings, decapitations, bashed in and blown-to- smithereens heads, homicidal nail guns, mountains of vomit- it is all there along with an oversupply of blood. References to the original trilogy in the form of the iconic chainsaw and possessed hand also feature, as does 'that' iconic scene in the woods. At 90 minutes the length of the movie is just right- there is never a dull moment, the editing is tight, and the visual effects are extremely believable. This is a horror film for today's generation bred on Saw and Hostel, it has the capability to jolt you from your chair and turn your face away in disgust. However, one thing this remake cannot do is to make you chuckle now and then, like the original did. This is a very serious movie with lots of shock value, but none of the simultaneous feeling of light heartedness, suspense and fear the classic evoked.To sum up, the 2013 Evil Dead remake is a good horror movie in its own right, which is more of an indictment of the sad state of affairs the genre currently is in. But it is no seminal achievement like the original was. I believe the 70s and 80s produced the best horror, whether it was Italian giallo or standard monster feasts- there was more emotion, fear, a sense of foreboding, less of gore. Now with advances in VFX the gore is more prominent, sometimes all important, while other values get dumped by the wayside. Raimi and Campbell wore producer hats in this, but they could not repeat the ultimate experience in grueling terror once again. The cult classic triumvirate remains intact then. So long, remakes :)",7,2,13,2 July 2013
Elysium," Good, not great!
","How long is capitalism good for global progress and economic growth? Can science help rein in our innate selfishness, and make the world a better place? Or does it just help the moneyed few, and grow the gulf further between the haves and the have nots? Already there are signs of the latter- however the spin doctors may be spinning their numbers, the poor in the world are increasingly getting poorer, and the rich are getting richer. At the same time, global resources are exponentially decreasing- in this kind of a scenario, we might not have to wait till 150 for an Elysium to be created, and it being over-run.The year is 2154, and nothing else highlights the prevalent social and economic inequalities than Elysium-a pristine, man made space station with magical medical facilities, where the wealthy have retired to, while the poor continue to live in servitude in a devastated earth. All it takes though is one small opening to break the boundaries, and Matt Damon as Max Costa is the catalyst for this revolution, as almost single-handedly and improbably so, he brings equality to the system, battling scheming politicians, and blood-thirsty mercenaries.Neill Blomkamp is way down from his stratospheric 2009 debut, District 9 here, but there is no doubting his vision, and mastery over action, thrills and visual effects. But the script is not half as good, the characters not interesting enough, and the acting is ho hum too. Matt Damon is almost trans-humanly serene, Jodie Foster looked disinterested, and Sharlto Copley might do the crazed act passably well enough, but has a unintelligible accent and is utterly predictable. Elysium reminded me so much of Oblivion, similar strengths, similar flaws. In fact, utterly predictable is something you could say for the entire movie, and that is never a good thing to say when it comes to sci-fi flicks. To sum up, Elysium tries to marry social commentary with sci-fi. The aim was honest, the execution, could have been better. See it for it's beautiful imagery and out of the world action set pieces, and brush under the carpet, its improbabilities and lack of emotional connect- 7/10",7,0,1,28 September 2013
The Artist," Pure Class. A masterpiece. Triumphant!
","If you don't understand my silence, you'll never understand my words..I remember with great fondness the good old Charlie Chaplin movies when they used to play on Sundays on Doordashan- silent, yet laced with so much slapstick humor and emotional wallop, that even to this day, they remain my most memorable cinematic experiences. While the introduction of sound was a significant development in the history of cinema changing the level of audience involvement and creating new stars, but it also led to the supposed demise of the silent movie stars. Or did it not? This myth is brought to life in Michel Hazanavicius's The Artist where a silent movie actor -George Valentin finds himself fading from the limelight once silent cinema goes out of vogue. It's strength is in its inspired performances and its seamless updating of the kind of visual storytelling used in the silent era, and its weakness lies in a story that's as predictable as every other modern romantic comedy.It is 1927 and George Valentin (played by Jean Dujardin) is the reigning king of Hollywood, at the apex of his popularity. His movies are in black and white and silent. He is a cross between Gene Kelly with the dazzling smile and Clark Gable with his intense eyes. George is self assured, loves audience attention and in general is soaking in the good times. A fateful day brings young, starry eyed and looking for an opportunity Peppy Miller (played by Bernice Bejo) together with George- that moment in the spotlight sets Peppy on the road to stardom. George does his little bit to create her unique identity, and they begin to lovingly fall in love with each other. He is enraptured on the set as he watches her legs rehearsing a dance behind a backdrop screen, and she puts her arm in an empty jacket sleeve caressing herself in a imaginary embrace. Their connection is instantaneous, and their affection is infectious. They make each other happy, and by the end of the movie, there would be no two thoughts about the fact that they were made for each other. Though their story may look clichéd, the scenes will make you tingle no matter how often you see it.But since George is a mega star, it means he is not prepared for the advent of sound in pictures, and the fact that it will change his life. In a metaphorical scene, when George walks out of his studio and walks down a staircase with a plan to make his magnum opus silent movie, he meets Peppy who is walking her way up. Peppy's film career explodes, and George's career implodes, both spectacularly so. By not accepting the future, George willfully sabotages his own life- he loses his wife, his wealth, his respect, and find solace in the bottle and his adorable Jack Russell terrier. Will Peppy come to the rescue and arrest George's decline into madness, and more importantly, will George allow her to help him? Watch the movie for the answers, but this I have to say that you will come out smiling :) The film has a carefully constructed tone that lingers between comedy and drama, playing alternately with melancholic and playful tones, bordering on light satire. It's both a creative success and a crowd pleasing movie, with the two stars delivering perfect Hollywood characterizations. Dujardin is already a big star in the film industry and here he plays George with terrific magnetism, and in the latter half, excellent poignancy. He has great screen presence, and an irresistible smile, ably complemented by Bernice Bejo who is beautiful, passionate, sassy and exuberant, endowed with positivity and willpower. Last but not the least is the fabulous music score that aptly captures every mood, and George's Jack Russell who often steals the show from his talented master. In this era of slam bang actioners, cacophonous explosions, VFX laden spectacles, remakes and sequels and of course the ubiquitous 3D, it takes extreme gumption to make a silent film that celebrates the old magic of movies. Director Michael Hazanivicius deserves more than a pat on his back for crafting a movie which is deeply reverential of the world of movie making, in addition to stimulating the sense of joy in all of us, making it irresistibly charming and appealing to the modern audience. The film already has 10 Oscar nominations, and already has swept other global awards. The Artist is a triumphant celebration of the artistry in movies, and in that it scores a 10/10. Its a must watch for the viewer with taste. My pick for best director, and best actor for tomorrow's Oscars.",10,6,11,25 February 2012
In Time," good, could have been great!
","Time is money- our parents used to say, and in an era of declining personalization and increasing digitization some of us still bow in reverence to that farsighted thought. In Time takes this concept a step further, to a cacotopian earth, where time IS everything indeed, including money. And it is this subsumption that makes the movie distinct, and watchable.In this world, through genetic technology, everyone stops aging at 25, and from that moment they have 1 year to live. Their life henceforth can be extended if they are able to conjure up deals, trade-offs or of course, crime. And this earth too like ours can provide for everyone's need but not everyone's greed (Gandhi). Hence this presumably utopian society has similar set of problems- an even deeper rich-poor divide where the poor live in ghettos, amid a life of crime and misery, and on borrowed time, while the rich live in opulent mansions, ride swanky cars, and have literally, all the time in the world. The first scene in the movie presents one of the biggest fallouts of this theory- that a 30 something Olivia Wilde playing mother to, well, a 30 something Justin Timberlake. The people here are born with a digital clock in their hands which tells them exactly how much time they have left to live, which, when over, leads to sudden death. This is all a ploy to maintain balance in the world- 'for a few immortals, many people must die'- as one protagonist explains. In this carefully orchestrated world of orderly chaos, Justin Timberlake is Will Salas, who when falsely accused of stealing time from someone rich, starts a chain reaction which ultimately brings down the system. It would be foolish to read between the lines in this type of an alternate world movie- just how does one keep track of global time supply? How can exchange of time, and in essence life, happen just by holding someone's hand without putting into play the intent of the person (which means a criminal doesn't need a gun to kill you, just hold your hand)? And it is fairly obvious that there wasn't a lot of budget to play with in this movie. But what matters here is the amount of thought and detail that the director has been able to put into the story, which is good when it starts, mediocre in the second half, when the film resembles a version of Bonnie and Clyde, with Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried turning modern day Robin Hoods. And while there is not an iota of doubt that both of them look pretty all the time, there is a shocking lack of chemistry and interest in the movie on their part. In other words, they mostly sleepwalk through their role- begs the question, were they paid money for this, or time :PThis year has given us some grand movies- superheroes, aliens, superspys, witches and warriors, all with mega budgets, 3D renditions and little thought. But In Time is perhaps the years first science fiction movie that has some originality, and makes you sit up and cogitate, and in that, the movie is just IN TIME, before the year ends :)",6,0,2,24 December 2011
The Shape of Water," a magical romance
","The Shape of Water is grounded in magical realism, a genre which combines elements of magic in an extremely realistic environment, but in essence is a twisted monster-fairy tale. Most monster stories have featured infatuations with things of beauty, only to end sadly with the monster protagonists, ala King Kong. The Shape of Water though is progressive-it follows through to a happy ending for both it's monster/god central character and it's human lover. And unlike the human converting the monster into another human (Beauty and the Beast) , it has the monster converting the human to, well, it's type. The story is set at the height of the Cold War, 1962, where everything that every American used to do was looked through the filter of being pro-communism. Elisa Esposito, played to Academy award nominated perfection by Sally Hawkins, is a mute cleaning lady working at a top secret research institute in Baltimore. An amphibious creature (called The Asset), and played emotively by Doug Jones, is brought from the Amazon to the lab by Strickland, played in perverse style by Michael Shannon. 'The natives in the Amazon worshipped it. Like a god. We need to take it apart, learn how it works'Merman or god, he is not in for a good time at the research institute, and typical of del Toro movies, humans are more monstrous than conventional monsters. Elisa's lack of speech helps form a bond with the Asset. Speaking of whom, he is curiously similar to del Toro's other amphibious character from Hellboy- Abe Sapien. Love for eggs, and classical music is all there. Understanding the finality of the creature's fate, Elisa, with her friends, hatches a plan to take it away from the institute. 'When he looks at me, the way he looks at me... He does not know, what I lack... Or - how - I am incomplete. He sees me, for what I - am, as I am. He's happy - to see me. Every time. Every day. Now, I can either save him... or let him die.'Soon the bond translates to love, but the creature is dying, and needs open water to survive. After that the plot focuses on racing against the Communists and Strickland to set it free in the sea. The ending is deliciously open ended too- does Elisa survive in the end or that is what the narrator wants us to think? Was she a mermaid in human guise? Does the story have a happy ending, however improbable it may be? Guillermo del Toro is at his best in The Shape of Water. His love for monsters shows in his body of work (Hellboy, Pacific Rim, Pan's Labyrinth, Crimson Peak), and The Shape of Water is no different here. Del Toro creates a fascinating world, full of relatable characters, and drily so, takes digs at today's environment. The central human character is probably a Mexican, the villain is a gun-loving white man, and if a love story between an animal and human isn't awkward enough, there is an old man in the movie who is secretly gay! What would Trump say about that last bit? If the first ace for The Shape of Water was the characters, the next ace is the script. It is delightfully funny, even for those who do not talk and communicate only through expressions and signs. The third ace though is the real deal- he manages to extract superb performances from all the actors. Be it Sally Hawkins, Richard Jenkins, Octavia Spencer, or Michael Shannon. Nominated for 13 Oscars, with 93 wins and 263 other nominations- is the hype real and is The Shape of Water the best film of 2017? Might not be, but seriously, who could have thought that something so unconventional could be so romantic? Here is raising a glass to Elisa Esposito's groundbreaking romance!",9,26,50,4 March 2018
Edge of Tomorrow," Loved it!
","Summer blockbusters have a degree of sameness to them. They are big, loud, comic book sourced, star studded, and graphic heavy, with billions of dollars of marketing muscle ensuring audience interest. But now and then, something like the Edge of Tomorrow comes, reaffirming Hollywood's creativity, intelligence, wit and above all- ability to give the audience a good time. Live. Die. Repeat.These three words beautifully sum up the time twisting plot of Edge of Tomorrow. You die, you wake up, relive the same day, only to die again and repeat the cycle. In this Groundhog Day meeting Starship Troopers adaptation, the world has been invaded by a race of seemingly unstoppable spidery aliens called mimics (their look lifted straight from the Matrix). They are an intelligent breed, being called mimics because of their ability to learn and copy human actions, but for destructive convenience, they are shown to have a hive mentality with a central brain that processes their actions. After being at the receiving end for a long time, earth forces score a victory at Verdun. The enemy seems to be on the defensive as human forces aim for a final offensive D-Day style at Normandy. Is it our endgame or theirs?'I died within five minutes of landing at that beach, along with every other soldier.'Cruise is center stage to yet another war of the worlds, initially as a PR spin doctor, William Cage, who incurs the wrath of a commanding officer to end up in the battle front-line. The offensive, it seems is doomed as the aliens seem to have been expecting them. Moments after landing Cruise dies, but not before being sprayed by some alien blue blood. This action forces him to go into a time loop, and much like a video game character, he keeps reliving the same day again and again. Each time though, he is able to use his memories of the battle to survive longer. No one believes his story though, except ace solder Rita Vrataski (Emily Blunt), who has also been affected in the same way earlier. Together Cage and Rita must locate and destroy the alien brain to end the war.Repetition is the worst thing a movie can have. Watching the same scene, with minor variations over and over is a tedious affair. Director Doug Liman addresses this by showing just enough of a scene to establish the loop, and then moves ahead to scenes where the story begins to change, thus ensuring a rapid pace to the story, and plenty of action, which despite the fact being repeated, does not feel repetitive . It also allows for oodles of macabre humor. People who complain than Tom Cruise always lives will have a field day here. Cruise dies hundreds of times, each one more unexpected, and even funnier than the previous one. At the same time, his budding romantic relationship with Rita is treated with subtlety and thought. For him, it is a growing connection, but for her every day is a new day, like Drew Barrymore in Fifty First Dates, and so she herself kills him many times over. The visual effects are fantastic, and the ending, though generic, is still satisfactory. Humanity owes its existence to Tom Cruise, or so it seems. Once an actor who used to try out diverse roles, today is reduced to just an action hero. It is really hard to keep a count of the number of times he has saved the world. In Edge of Tomorrow though, Cruise is in top form, and for once not taking himself too seriously, but for a change lacing his still charming personality with loads of hilarity. Emily Blunt, Brendon Gleeson and Bill Paxton play great supporting acts. I like any movie that can make me laugh. Edge of Tomorrow did, despite its oh so serious doomsday scenario. it treads the fine line between entertainment and intelligence oh so very well, for that it gets my recommendation. Go on, watch it- 9/10",9,2,4,5 June 2014
The Conjuring," True story, truly scary
","Am not an easy man to scare. Countless movies have gone by, yet rarely have i been scared like the way I was today by The Conjuring. At first glance, it is easy to write it off- haunted house as a horror theme has been ground to dust. But oh so much dust it does raise, because together with the well constructed chills inter-spaced with wry humor and excellent acting, surely, this must rank as one of the finest horror movies of this decade.'Something awful happened here'The Conjuring has all the staples of a horror movie- innocent victims, statuesque haunted farmhouse complete with a tree to 'hang on', oak wardrobes, wooden dolls, creaky floorboards, foul odors, Salem witches, cellars and other dark places. Set in the fashionable 70s, the Warrens, Ed(Patrick Wilson) and Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) are successful and well respected ghost hunters. Together they are a good team- Ed is all authoritative, Lorraine is all empathy. They are contacted by the Perrons to investigate paranormal occurrences in Massachusetts, a close investigation of which reveal a generations old evil that begins acting up as the movie progresses. Director James Wan already explored this theme is his earlier classic- Insidious. In addition to doffing his cap to classics like Exorcist, Poltergeist, Amityville Horror and The Birds, he exhibits mastery over the most important aspect of a horror movie- its tempo. He allows a slow build up, then the lull, followed by the storm. Walls crash, chairs fly, birds crash into windows, the possessed retch and levitate at will as a phenomenally intense climax builds up. All this is achieved with minimal blood and visual effects, unlike The Evil Dead remake. The acting overall is excellent, you feel what the Perrons are going through- their togetherness, their joy, their shock and later, their terror. The music is sheer class, and a pair of clapping hands never was so creepy. The Conjuring is an ode then to man's primordial joy of getting scared. It's only flaw maybe its predictability, but it's treatment is honest and simple. As a result even the most rational viewer will keep looking back when alone in the dark. Horror fans rejoice- yours prayers have finally been answered, here is a modern day classic at last. PS- if you feel the poster picture is tame, watch the movie to find out what happens right after this scene :)",10,0,3,3 August 2013
Prometheus," The new benchmark in film- making
","Prometheus left me speechless, it also left me feeling cheated, here's why. There is something about science fiction that brings out the best in Ridley Scott, fires up his imagination to deliver spectacles of epic proportions- first it was Alien, then Blade Runner, and now Prometheus. With the Alien franchise having moved into B movie territory with the AVP series, and the need to satisfy the billions of Alien fanboys, Prometheus fuses two sci-fi classics- 2001: A Space Odyssey and Aliens into one- man's search for his creator leading to the encounter with its most insidious enemy, thus creating a feature that not only serves as a prequel of sorts to the first Alien movie, but also on its own emerge as a genre defining, standalone feature overflowing with visual splendor. 'Who does not want to meet his maker'-the starting sequence of the movie sets an appropriately majestic tone-in an apparently lifeless world a long time ago, a humanoid alien sacrifices himself- his body disintegrating and flowing in with the water, and then later forming the first living cells. Is it blasphemy to believe an alien is our creator? The film fast forwards to the year 2089, where archaeologists Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green) discover a number of drawings from different ancient cultures that depict the worship of a set of planets that are about 500 billion miles, or 2 years away from the earth. A few years later, a trillion dollar discovery mission is launched, sponsored by Peter Weyland (Guy Pierce), of Weyland Industries. Because he stole fire from the Gods for man, Prometheus is often toted as the link between man and god. Prometheus, the titular exploratory spaceship in the film is aptly named as the vessel that aims to unite man with his God, his 'Engineer'- as they call the alien species. While the astronauts are in cryosleep, they are watched over by the star of the movie- an android who knows or can figure out anything, named David, played by the guy- who-can-do-nothing-wrong Michael Fassbender. Early in the movie his creator claims that David is his son, but pity he cannot feel anything as he has no soul- there cannot be a wrong-er statement than this one. He is inanimate, but he seems to have more soul than anyone else in the cast. With or without his head, Fassbender plays his android with subtlety, wit, charm and humor Upon landing on the planet, the visitors find out that all but one of the Engineers that they have been seeking are long dead, and that the planet is inhabited by a reptilian parasitic species that spews acid, likes to hug faces, do mouth to mouth (literally), and of course, do the iconic chest bursts. Predictably, one by one the crew members of the Prometheus meet their gruesome deaths. Even though this one is more of a scifi thriller than the slasher horror that Alien was, i loved the gore content, wished there was a bit more too. 'Stop the ship or there won't be any home to go back to- says Shaw, as the sole surviving Engineer sets out to launch the infested alien ship towards earth. Heeding her, the pilots of the Prometheus collide their ship in an electrifying climax. Speaking of Noopi Rapace as Shaw, hers' is a gutsy performance. She is particularly effective in one of the most harrowing scenes in recent movie history- where she conducts an impromptu c-section on herself to take out an alien fetus. However unforgettable this scene is, she still cannot carry a film on her own like tough girl of yesteryear's Sigourney Weaver did.Why the Engineers are set upon destroying what they created is never explained, as is the presence of the lovable face hugging/chest bursting xenomorphs. David says 'who doesn't want to kill their father'- does that mean the Engineers were fearful of their creation, of man coming to destroy them? But then in a different tangent, David muses that sometimes it is necessary to destroy first and then create- so were the Engineers again trying to start a creation cycle by destroying all life on Earth? Does Armageddon consist of chest bursting aliens? Was it necessary to get the origin of man angle?That is the unforgivable thing about Prometheus - that it provokes many questions, but holds back all answers for the sequel. On one hand you have arguably the most gorgeous movie ever made. The attention to detail is fantastic, the direction mostly mesmerizing, and the grandeur of it all is unparalleled. Watch this in the best 3D you have got around you, because like Avatar, in the hands of an intelligent director, 3D morphs into an experience rather than a few tacky shots that come all around you. Ridley Scott literally transports you to new worlds, you can smell it, feel it, fear it even. It has an incredible sense of occasion- the planet and dome exploratory sequences are downright awe-inspiring. There is human on alien, alien on alien and robot on alien action, and of course the fan favorite Alien Queen makes her presence felt. But there are plenty of plot holes and unanswered questions, and however it may try to breakout as an independent franchise, it will always have billions of pounds of expectations.On its own, Prometheus is millions of dollars spent in the right direction to give a maximum cinema experience. Prometheus is all at once entertaining, thrilling, and spiritual and asks thought provoking existential questions- whether all that is too much to absorb from one movie is an individual choice. After a spate of duds, Ridley Scott is back with a bang with a compelling story, and fascinating film-making. He has opened new doors in addition to creating a flow to his original epic, I just wished it answered a few more questions. 9/10- DO NOT MISS!",9,5,9,8 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Wonderful
","In the movie, Wonder Woman saves the world. In real life, Wonder Woman breathes new life into the DC Extended Universe. Marvel has been formulaic but successful when it comes to creating their movie universe, while the Warner Bros/DC approach so far has been flawed, risky and divisive. Director Patty Jenkins though sets everything right with one of the most nuanced superhero origin movies ever made.The plot though stays close to the comics, only trading one war of another. The year is 1918, the war that was meant to end all wars is still on with millions of casualties on both sides. The Amazons are in Themiscyra, hidden from the rest of the world. Diana is the daughter of Zeus, and is just beginning to realize her powers when Steve Trevor, British spy comes knocking into Themiscyra, with a bunch of Germans behind him. After a brief skirmish, the Amazonians come to know of the ongoing confrontation, and the intention of certain people to prolong it. Diana guesses that the God of War Ares is manipulating the war and decides to eliminate him. The rest of the movie is about Diana's understanding that humanity consists of both good and bad and this is what makes them unique, and in the process herself transform from a powerful Amazonian, to a god.Patty Jenkins keeps it simple- a wry script, fast pace, rocking background score, great fight sequences and terrific visuals are key her ingredients. Couple that with her ability to extract excellent performances from the entire star-cast, and no wonder you have a billion $ movie coming right up.As compared to Zack Snyder's gritty dark takes, Wonder Woman is a mood uplifting movie. By the time it ends, you truly believe that there is hope left in this world. And that itself is Diana Prince's true superpower. Go on and enjoy a movie that will truly brighten up your day. 10/10",10,14,30,5 June 2017
The Wolverine," Steel vs Adamantium- scintillating clash
","There is a reason the X Men in the movies are best in a team- none of them are charismatic enough to pull a movie on their own. Except perhaps Wolverine. The very extension of this tortured loner's superpowers is cause for incomparable pain. And his immortality which means living forever with the choices that one makes, can be a curse too. While the 2009 wolverine origins movie was a cartoonish effort, this one though draws from one of the most inspirational arcs in the Wolverine comics lore- the 1983 Claremont/Miller miniseries. Japan's importance may be declining in the world, but Hollywood's fascination with Japan only seems to be rising. Couple of weeks back it was Pacific Rim, and this week it is Wolverine. The time-line is somewhere after the events of X Men Last Stand. Wracked with guilt over killing Jean Grey, Logan renounces his world saving days, he retreats into the Alaskan mountains, to befriend the occasional grizzly, take on errant hunters, stay away from hair and care products and chit chatting with Jean's ghost. His miserable existence takes an unexpected turn when he summoned to Japan by someone whose life he had saved during the Nagasaki bombing in the second world war. Yashida, a humble army commandant then, is now the most powerful man in Japan spearheading an industrial conglomerate. Yashida offers Logan the chance to let go of his superpowers so that he can lead a normal life. Logan refuses but anyways loses his regenerative powers, and quickly gets entangled into a web of blood and deception involving everything Japan- ninjas, yakuzas, katanas, martial arts, bullet trains and steel.This is Hugh Jackman's sixth turn at this character and he looks positively tired, but powers up whenever the action demands. The Japanese characters are stereotype Asian, while the only other mutant in the movie is slinky as a viper. Director James Mangold tries to stick close to the source, with a number of shots that are straight off the graphic comic book's panels. Logan needing a bodyguard takes some time to sink in, while the humor is mostly derived from his devil may care attitude. There is plenty of action though, with Logan slicing off yakuzas and ninjas an intermittent feature. The sequence on top of the bullet train particularly energetic, along with a climactic fight to the finish with the Silver Samurai.As a theme Wolverine eschews global annihilation and explosive set pieces in favor of an intimate take. Think of this as a samurai movie, with the hero wielding adamantium instead of steel. To put things into perspective, the only explosion in the entire movie is the one at the start at Nagasaki, and that too is pictured at a distance. Wolverine in a way is the picture the character always deserved- aptly showcasing his torment, inner struggles and his quest for the meaning of his life. This is more than just popcorn entertainment, it is a solid action thriller. Those seeking a world threatening tale need to wait for the post credits scene.",8,2,6,27 July 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," A fitting end
","What makes the Batman so appealing? Essentially a caped and cowled crusader earning his bread by his ability to strike fear, albeit with lots of cash and technology to boot, Batman is easily the most human of all superheroes. Tormented, often ridiculed, and always looking for relevance, he is but an enhanced everyman.The Dark Knight Rises picks up eight years after the fateful events in The Dark Knight, where the Batman lost his love (Rachel Dawes) and also struck a Faustian deal with Police Commissioner Gordon where he disappeared from the public taking the rap for Harvey Dent's death. Bruce Wayne has become a recluse, only to be drawn out into the world when cat burglar Selina Kyles as Catwoman stirs his fancy. Something is rotten in Gotham, though there is an uneasy peace prevalent, for Commissioner Gordon thinks it is the lull before the storm, and he is prophetically proved as masked terrorist Bane explodes into the scene literally. In a thrilling and audacious opening sequence, Nolan sets the tone by orchestrating a mid air kidnapping. The Batman trilogy deals closely with post 9/11 terrorism than any other movie- and here too the context is evident as Bane destroys first the stock exchange, then a football stadium and cuts off Gotham from the rest of the world, throwing it into complete anarchy. He might not be a jihadi and might speak with a cheerful English accent, but comes from a hell-hole in the subcontinent, and is clearly socialist- wants to turn over power to the people, obliterate the symbol of law and order, Batman, and bomb the living daylights out of Gotham. Like a well orchestrated symphony, Bane sets things in motion that create overwhelming odds for the Batman who now has the fight of his life on his hands, because for the first time he faces an adversary that is more powerful than him and staggeringly smart too. Broken, battered and bloodied, but like an All American hero, the Dark Knight rises up one final time for a fitting climax to the best superhero trilogy ever.But Christopher Nolan is wrapping it all up here, so there are strands from the earlier movies woven in. To his credit, Nolan makes a brilliant crime drama playing out of a superhero movie elevating the genre to art with its entertainment quotient intact- grandiose and emotional at the same time. There are soul searching moments, as there is plenty of action along with super-cool gadgets. This movie is as much about ends as about beginnings. Bane is following what Ra's Al Ghul set out to do in Batman Begins- ie. In a world without redemption, destroy this corrupt society so that a new one can take its place. Alfred wishes Bruce Wayne to start a new life, even the Catwoman is running after for a clean slate. At the same time, The Dark Knight Rises explores recurring themes such a) As a villain instilling fear (Scarecrow through chemicals, Joker through random unpredictability, and Bane through brute force), b) 'what you are in the dark'- Bruce always believes the people of Gotham are inherently good, while his adversaries think the opposite, and c) the Batman's desire to save the city at whatever cost.Key highlight of the movie are powerhouse performances by an eclectic mix of actors from whom we expect, and some new surprises. Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Michael Caine as Alfred are series regulars that like wine kept getting better with age. The newcomers are scene stealers in their own right- Joseph Gordon- Levitt as rookie cop John 'Robin' Blake brings earnestness and gravitas to every scene he is in- a working man hero. And as Selina Kyle/Catwoman, Anna Hathaway just blows apart all her previous wonderful performances by getting just the right amount of catty, ass-kicky and supreme sexy. Hers' is the best character in the movie- ethically and morally ambiguous, you really can't help but keep thinking what she will do next.The movie's weaknesses are in a way linked to its strengths- this is a heavy and dark, nay, almost black film with an apocalyptic future that treads the fine line between entertainment and lessons in morality. And even with a 3 hr running time, too many characters do spoil the broth. Comparisons are inevitable, and this one lacks in intensity as compared to its predecessor. The Dark Knight made me squirm in my seat, and gave sleepless nights. I had kept playing myself on one of those ferries with THAT choice to make, and never found an answer. Any comic film is as good as its villain- Tom Hardy as Bane radiates intensity and presence, but now I realize how crucial Heath Ledger's Joker was to the epic-ness of The Dark Knight. To be fair, it is not right to expect Bane with his mask and one dimensional character to come up trumps when up against the insidious Joker, but I did wish for some more swagger and style from the only man that ever 'broke the bat'. Christian Bale as both Bruce Wayne/Batman looked tired throughout- might be what the script required but it kind of felt that he has had enough. He looked like a rubber stuffed toy in that overdone suit, and after building the sacrifice friendly legend of Batman in the earlier movies, shouldn't it all have ended in an explosion in the sea? Was the final happy moment necessary? Oh, but superheroes never die. Mildly disappointing, but maybe I am nitpicking, but only so because expectations were sky high.To sum up, this is a near perfect effort from currently the best movie-maker in the world at the height of his powers. It is a fitting and satisfying end to a blockbuster series which will inspire future generations of movie makers. Easy to say film of the year and a must watch for all- 9/10",9,1,5,20 July 2012
Black Panther," Marvel-lous
","When the going gets tough, the tough gets going.Not that in the comic book film universe, the going has got tough for Marvel due to DC Comics. We all know how Justice League ended up. The going has got tough for Marvel because of Marvel itself. Civil War and Thor: Ragnarok in their own way set the new gold standards. Also, as new characters enter the MCU, the treatment needs to change too. A comic book blockbuster today needs to be more than just a comic book blockbuster- and that is what makes Black Panther great. With gracious heroes, quipping villains, rocking car chases and fantastic weapons, it is an out and out enjoyable comic book blockbuster for sure. Elements of espionage sagas with homage to 007 Bond, paired with Afro futurist themes along with some Shakespearean twists gives the movie it's own flavor. Marvel movies are increasingly getting interlinked, so for someone who has missed Civil War, there is a lot to catch up. For someone who hasn't, we jump straight into Black Panther roots and origins. 'Ulysses Klaue: Tell me something. What do you know about Wakanda?
Everett K. Ross: It's a Third-World country. Textiles, shepherds, cool outfits.
Ulysses Klaue: All a front. Explorers have searched for it, called it 'El Dorado'. They looked for it in South America, but it was in Africa the whole time. I'm the only one who's seen it, and made it out alive.'Welcome to Wakanda- blessed with mountains of vibranium, it is the most advanced society in the world. Fearful of the world's reaction to it's vibranium reserves, its culture and people, for centuries Wakanda has hidden it's true progress from the rest of the world. So while the motto is not 'America First', but it is 'Wakanda Forever'.While T'Ã‡halla wants to stay the path, there are others who feel Wakanda should share it's success with the rest of Africa, who have been brutalized by invasion, exploitation and colonization. 'To be or not to be the savior of the oppressed world' - this Shakespearean choice for the characters forms the crux of the story. The hunt for Ulysses Klaue sets in motion the plans of Erik Killmonger- an American mercenary wronged in the past by the Wakandan royal family, and scarred by his experiences in the real world. T'Challa will need to draw up on every ounce of strength, and all the friends he has to save Wakanda. Director Ryan Coogler is coming off Creed, and he delivers here too by crafting a movie that isn't about fighting gods and robots, or chasing aliens, but more about the rights to privilege. In Erik Killmonger, he has created a villain to whom at least half the audience will agree too. Wakandans have thrived while the rest of Africa has burned. Killmonger has a point. He has also assembled the finest set of black actors working today- Chadwick Boseman plays Black Panther with pathos, Lupita Nyong'o exudes radiance as Nakia, a covert agent, Michael B. Jordan plays Killmonger with feral intensity, Forest Whitaker plays Zuri, the royal shaman while Angela Bassett plays Ramona, the queen mother. The standout characters though are Shuri, played by Letitia Wright, and Okoyo, played by Danai Gurira. Said to be smarter than Tony Stark, Shuri is the Q to T'Challa's Bond, and goes about her role with vibrancy and style. Okoyo is the badass leader of T'Challa's bodyguards, stars in the action sequences and also delivers some of the funniest lines. And I especially loved Andy Serkis in front of the camera as a maniacal Klaue! Coogler has really soaked up the culture of the continent and let his imagination run wild. Wakanda is a riot of colors, steeped in spirituality and culture and because it was undisturbed by colonization - also a technological marvel. Is this what Africa could have been?Bottomline- Black Panther is not only a fun movie, it is also a very impactful movie. Marvel getting marvelous, really!

Thor: The Dark World," Extremely enjoyable. Grandoise vision. Impeccable execution
","I am a long time fan of comic books, and have really enjoyed Hollywood's current craze with them. Over the past few years, Marvel has reinvented large scale movie spectacles, infusing action and wit with science fiction and fantasy with great effectiveness, and earning top dollar for it. They have hit the bull's-eye again with Thor- The Dark World. As a sequel it belong to a hallowed club- it betters 2011's Thor in every conceivable way- better acting, better plot, better action and way better humor making for one thrilling experience.The story is standard superhero stuff- there is a catastrophic power. Dark forces once wielded it, good guys hid it, somehow it surfaces, dark forces want to reclaim it, and it is time again for the good guys to stand up again to ensure it does not happen. After a lengthy prologue that tell us about events that predates the creation of the universe as we know it, the movie picks up right after the New York invasion in the Avengers. Loki is in Asgard as a prisoner, and Thor and Jane Foster are united again, but only after Jane accidentally stumbles into another dimension and embodies an ancient dark power- the Aether. The dark elf Malekith wants to possess it to, well, turn all universe into darkness. After Asgard is invaded, and the only thing that both Thor and Loki loved is taken away from them, an uneasy alliance between the two remains the only thing that can stop the destruction of the universe. All in all, a premise that requires a lot of popcorn to digest.'I wish i could trust you'- Thor 'Trust my rage'- LokiShoehorning Norse mythology into science fiction is a crazy idea, right? But what execution here. The production values are impeccable, kind of leave The Avengers far behind, even though extensively shot in Marvel's version of Asgard which is an imaginative living, breathing world. Game of Thrones director Alan Taylor is at the helm here, and the mega bucks at his disposal come off strongly. The pace is snappy, there is never a dull moment due to frequent action and the infectious humor- Kat Dennings, Chris O'Dowd, Tom Hiddleston, Stellan Skaarsgaard gets guffaw inducing lines. This is as much Liam Hemsworth's movie as it is Tom Hiddlestons'. If Thor is called as the witless oaf who would punch his way out of a situation, Loki is irresistible as the snarky, duplicitous, conflicted, whimsical trickster, an anti-hero that today's Breaking Bad generation would love to bits. Loki shifts from black to white to grey, and grey is what he will remain in the Marvel universe henceforth- choosing sides that benefit him. And in between comes in Chris Evans in a scene stealing cameo as Captain America lampooning himself ('I can feel the righteousness flowing through me!')It is true that we in India do not have a comic book culture, and the lack of quality source material is evident. A week back we had Krrish 3, which was ambitious no doubt but came out horribly clichéd. Thor-The Dark World is a 2 hour lesson for Rajesh Roshan on how to tell a wacky story that actually captivates the audience. It is goofy, has numerous plot holes but by God i had a great time watching it. Dazzling action, tons of humor (this is the third time i have mentioned the word in the review, i know!), charismatic actors and likable characters- this is the Marvel billion dollar formula and it is at full display here, audiences rejoice. Definitely recommended- 9/10",9,4,9,9 November 2013
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force is strong with this one
","Star Wars: The Force Awakens​ is the Christmas gift we all have been waiting for. JJ Abrams did with Star Wars​ what he did with Star Trek​ - staying within the canons of the franchise and playing safe, yet coming up with a fast paced entertainer that will wipe out all the bad memories of the last three installments of Star Wars.The Force Awakens is basically the same film as the first Star Wars film- A New Hope. There is a deserted planet to start with, along with a mysterious character who does not know that the Force is with her, and of course accompanied with a droid who holds a key secret. The Empire is back in the form of the New Order, the Emperor is back as Lord Snoke, and there is a new Darth Vader in town in the form of Kylo Ren. A beloved character dies at the hands of Ren, just like Obi-Wan did, there is a jumbo sized Death Star, the star-fighters are always the harbinger of good news, and there is a manic pilot to steer things the right way. What makes a stale tale fresh is the treatment. J. J. Abrams​ takes a cue from Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy​ and infuses The Force Awakens with enough energy and humor to power a few star-killer bases, along with stellar casting, superb editing and excellent 3D effects. Old characters appear not only for nostalgic reasons, but also to take the story further, slowly handing over the baton to a new trio of hitherto unknown but talented actors. The Force Awakens is made keeping in mind modern sensibilities- a strong female character, a colored hero, and second chances. Katniss Everdeen, Furiosa, and Beatrice Prior- bye bye. Rey, played in rocking style by Daisy Ridley​- the story rests of her frail shoulders, and this newbie delivers in fine style. Complementing her is John Boyega​'s Finn- a storm-trooper who is on the run, and Oscar Isaac​'s Poe Dameroon, the 'best pilot in the Resistance'. Opposing them is Adam Driver's Ren, who is a villain who needs to work upon being more evil. These four characters are Luke, Leia, Han and Vader for this generation. Will they become as iconic as the last generation? Time will tell, but it sure looks promising.The Force is strong with this one.",9,3,27,25 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," solid sequel
","The Hunger Games- Catching Fire is a worthy sequel to its fine predecessor. A quick flashback on the premise- in a dystopian future, Panem and its decadent elite rules over 12 impoverished and rebellious districts. Panem conducts an annual event- the Hunger Games to enforce their domination. The games are gladiatorial fights to the death and a test of survival between selected representatives from all the districts, and there must be only one winner. Catching fire Picks up right where the first one ended, when Katniss and Peeta were crowned joint victors on choosing to end their own life rather than take each others. 'Remember who the real enemy is'In this edition, they are now unwilling pawns for Panem, who want to use them to bring peace among the districts. When things start getting out of control, and the victors become a symbol of the revolution, a new Hunger Games where only ex victors would fight, is constituted. This time round the going gets a lot tougher as it is not innocent children, but vicious killers and shrewd survivors in the fray. Unlikely alliances need to be made, and bonds are tested to the utmost. The movie is not a slam-bam affair, it gets going slowly, and there is plenty of emotion, drama, and action. The budgets have doubled over the last movie, and it shows in the excellent quality visual effects. And of course there is Jennifer Lawrence playing Katniss with grace, vulnerability, inspiration and steel. In an environment thriving on animal instinct, she brings in a sense of humanity. At the same time, she is also a kid and she learns the hard way that defiance begets repercussions.Catching Fire suffers from the unfortunate case of being the second in a trilogy. Like the Matrix Reloaded or The Empire Strikes Back, it builds up to a point but then ends rather abruptly- as a result, a lot of questions, but no answers. Even then, it is a great lead up, with the bigger picture emerging- the focus of the series shifting away from Katniss, her family and love life, to the revolution, while at the same time probes deeper into the series themes of love, honor, loyalty and freedom.People who have watched 2012's Hunger Games will enjoy this thoroughly. Even though Catching Fire is highly recommended, new viewers will do well to see the prequel or reading the book before going for this. The odds are in its favor, after all- 8/10",8,1,15,7 December 2013
Godzilla," Godzilla movie review- Exhilarating experience!
","The king of monsters, the star of 30 movies, the biggest, baddest reptile is back with a bang. When it first stomped and screeched into the screen in 1954, it was a creature of rampant destruction, born out of nuclear radiation. Over the years Godzilla transformed itself into a savior, ridding the world of other fearsome creatures. Godzilla 2014 was a marvelous experience. This version pays homage to the Japanese versions by aping the look and feel of the monster, in addition to promoting its character of being a hero.The year is 1999, and Japanese scientist Serizawa travels to Philippines to investigate the discovery of fossils believed to be of ancient dinosaurs. It is not only fossils though, as something that hatched escaped and causes a nuclear power plant meltdown . Thousands die, including Sandra Brody, wife of plant engineer Joe Brody while the Japanese government covers up the incident as an earthquake. 15 years pass by, and Joe continues his endeavors to find the truth behind the accident. His son Ford, who is an explosives expert aids him in his latest foray, and they find out that giant creatures, called MUTO that feast on radiation were the cause of the meltdown, and are being contained by the government.'The arrogance of men is in thinking nature is in their control while it is the other way round'Nature is not to be contained then, and when things get out of control, Godzilla rises from the depths of the seas to restore balance in the world, in a spectacular, epic battle. Godzilla in this movie is a god, a primordial alpha predator who lives close to the earth's radioactive core. He does not really love humans but the stability of the world is important for his own survival, and so he fights the good fight, even after being attacked by the military. As far as the outcome goes, we all know what will happen since Godzilla never loses.Godzilla is a very different kind of kaiju film. Unlike last year's stylish, in your face Pacific Rim, the monster does not take center stage. It does not get to show off, and for some people there may be too little of Godzilla in his own film. Rather, most of the violence, chaos and liquidation takes place off-screen, or gets featured in massive tracking shots, the beauty and detail of which certainly require second viewings.Director Gareth Edwards does a fantastic job in doing the unpredictable, and creating a suspense film out of a monster brawl fest, much like Cloverfield or World War Z. Like Steven Spielberg's Jaws, Godzillá faces the camera a long time into the movie, but when it does, it is a goose pimp-ling moment. He has put on weight, but that calls for all the more respect, as his wallop packs even more power. The visual effects are breath-taking, and this is a movie that is a must watch in 3D. Godzilla finally delivering the coup de grace to the female MUTO is iconic.Though the star cast consists of heavyweights such as Bryan Cranston, David Strathairn, Juliette Binoche, Ashley Olsen and Aaron Taylor- Johnson, humans essentially become bystanders in a monster movie. While they all perform competently, there just isn't too much for them to do, but be awestruck most of the time.Godzilla is an excellent effort, and probably this summer's biggest non superhero movie. Go, watch it. Pander the child in you. I was shouting in the theater.There is nothing profound about it, just honest to goodness fun, and an exhilarating cinematic experience. 9/10",9,5,13,17 May 2014
Looper," Brilliant scifi crime thriller
","Disclaimer first- i am a sucker for time travel movies. Ever since Arnold Schwarzenegger's T101 strode on the screen from the distant future in 1984's The Terminator, the fascinating possibilities and impossibilities arising out of this technology has fueled billions of dollars worth sci-fi imagination. Part sci-fi and part gangster flick, Rian Johnson's Looper is easily the best original, non remake time- travel movie in decades- there i have said it.Mostly set in Kansas with a bit of China and Europe thrown in, Looper takes place in two time streams- 2044 and 2074. Time travel has been discovered by 2074 but declared illegal- only the mob has access to it and they use it rather creatively to settle scores. It is very difficult to kill someone in 2074 due to body tagging etc so the mob effectively uses time travel to send their enemies 30 years in the past to be blasted to bits by the Loopers, a group of assassins working in the past for the future crime-lords. Complex? And after a certain point, the 2074 version of a Looper is sent to the 2044 version of himself to be executed. Thus closing the loop and retiring the assassin. More complex? Fear not, that is about it- if the effectiveness of any scifi movie is measured by its ability to take up a seemingly ludicrous idea and get the audience involved without questioning its logic, then Looper is well and truly a blast, just like the blunderbuss used by the Loopers.Joe Simmons, played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is working as a looper dispatching enemies of his - leads the high life, has a stripper girlfriend and looking forward to his retirement in Paris. One fine day, he is faced with his own future self, played by the now ubiquitous Bruce Willis, as his target- he hesitates and sparks a chain of events that will determine his future existence in this world, along with ramifications for the crime syndicates in the future. Gordon Levitt has played the side character in numerous hits and he still may not have the charisma to carry a film on his own yet, but in Looper he takes on a far more challenging role- sheds his boyish charm to take up an action hero role. The amount of makeup they have put on him to make him look like a younger Bruce Willis makes him almost unrecognizable from his usual self. Speaking of Willis- no one, i repeat, no one in the industry still shoots off a gun with more malevolent joy than Bruce. He is super as a tortured assassin from the future, pining away for his murdered wife, willing to kill children to right his wrongs, and he still looks bad-ass enough to take down 20 man single-handedly, like 25 years ago in Die Hard. Emily Blunt as the mother of a child to whom there is more than meets the eye, and Jeff Daniels as the 2044 gang leader put in excellent performances too.Director Rian Johnson deserves tons of accolades- he has made a stylish action movie, with creativity, originality and energy, and at the same time it is thought provoking, affecting. This movie is not about overpowering effects, though the ones that are there are pretty awesome- it is more about people, and he gets us to care for each of them, whether the telekinetic child Cid, or the unstable killer in Kid Blue. There are scenes of gruesome violence that appear poetically along with sequences that intentionally slow down the narrative for the audience to absorb the essence. There are shades of classics such as Terminator and Bladerunner along with Ron Howard's gangster epic, Road to Perdition, but all put together, Looper is one brilliant scifi crime drama thriller that is a must watch for scifi fans- 9/10",9,2,6,13 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," Cloud Atlas movie review- Ambitious, brilliant, epic!
","No movie in 2012 will split audience opinion as diametrically as Cloud Atlas. Some will find it ambitious, exhilarating, brilliant cinema, other will find it a ponderous mismatch of form and substance. Either case, it is a movie that is guaranteed to remain unforgettable, and if you, like me, belong to the former club, it will warrant multiple viewings.Great source material is an essential ingredient to great movies- Cloud Atlas is based upon @David Mitchell's heady 2005 novel that chronicles six stories in different time-lines spanning over 600 years blending genres and tones to show the human soul moving from century to century, and explore how our actions in one life affect the next. While the stories in the book are linear, with one story ending leading to the next, the movie adaption takes liberties in narrative continuity, weaving the different story lines together adroitly to illustrate the interconnectivity of life in a way that may be confusing to start with, but rises to dizzying heights of creativity pretty quickly. Chronologically, the tales start from mid 19th century where a would be slave trader has a life changing experience, to a distant post apocalyptic future where a cowardly tribesman guides a researcher, and segments in between times that include a gay musician trying to make a name for himself, a crooked publisher who gets served, a journalist investigates a nuclear power plant, a clone who seeks self actualization and in effect sparking a revolution in a dystopian Seoul in 2144 (my personal favorite). Not all the stories are outstanding, but all ARE involving in their own way. And what makes the movie more demanding than the book is that the same set of actors plays different characters in different stories as a result of which we see the faces we know so well going through the universal themes of greed, oppression, hatred, and redemption, and personifying that regardless of the time, the core human values of love, courage and freedom remain the same. Much of the movie's genius is due to the actors, and with an A-list ensemble star cast comprising of Tom Hanks, Jim Broadbent, Jim Sturgess, Halle Berry, Hugo Weaving, Susan Sarandon among others, you really cannot go wrong. Sometimes almost unrecognizable due to their excellent make-up, these titans do an excellent job in making the audience feel the range of emotions they go through, and believing in their predicament and the choices they face. My personal favorite here again was Hanks as the evil Dr. Henry Goose and cockney author Dermot Hoggins.The Wachowski brothers, oops, can't say that any more as one of them has had a sex change, - Lana and Andy Wachowski are no strangers to futuristic cinema, but this movie is not just that genre- this is an epic adventure drama played across a canvas spanning many centuries and the sheer orchestration of this scale and characters is a wonder. The Wachowskis paired on this one with Tom Tykwer who gave us the classic Run Lola Run, and this time traveling, globe hopping extravaganza is not only a feast for the eyes, but also has moments of tenderness, humor, and suspense. Bottom-line- Cloud Atlas is surely easier to watch than to explain, so do not feel bad if you walk out of the nearly 3 hour long Cloud Atlas with more questions than answers- this is the kind of cinema that makes you think and ask questions now, and also 10 years down the line. Go on, enjoy some extraordinary quality cinema- 9/10",9,6,17,27 October 2012
The Hangover Part III," Borefest!
","Hangover 3 was the worst sequel to be released this summer. Singularly unfunny, unbearably scripted, and unfeelingly acted, thank god the trilogy ended. I do not even see the reason for this being a Hangover film, considering that none of the characters actually have a single drink, forget about a hangover. Ah, but Todd Philips was seeking closure after all. So we have one last adventure of the Wolf pack, up against their nemesis Chow, Alan finally growing up and only because he finds his lady love. While the headless giraffe at the start pointed to a truly wacky finale, the ride went downhill all throughout. Less of a raunchy comedy and more like a run of the mill action thriller, this is a movie that leads its loyal fans to an endless journey into nothingness. Bradley Cooper sleepwalked through the movie, Zack Galifianikis and Ed Helms put slightly more effort, John Goodman seems to be itching to disappear from every scene he is in, while Ken Jeong is the usual party popper that he is in every movie he acts. There is nothing to even sum up for The Hangover 3, except to say that I am terribly disappointed, and that itself is an understatement- 3/10",3,0,1,20 September 2013
John Wick: Chapter 2," Ferocious Fun
","'The man. The myth. The legend. John Wick. You are not very good at retiring.'Thank god John Wick is not good at retiring. He is back, and obliterates every action movie made in the last 10 years, out of the park. Hollywood history has proved bigger is not necessarily better, but John Wick is one of the few exceptions. 2X bigger budget, but 4X the fun as compared to the original.Speaking of which, the movie starts 5 days after the first movie ended, with Wick tracking down his trusty Mustang at yet another Tarasov's. A brutal fight follows that seems pointless as it ends in a peace offering, but it is not quite pointless- it sets up John Wick's character for the uninitiated. That he is focused, commitment, has sheer fu***ng will, and all the stories about him are watered down versions of actual events. And that is the excellent thing about the characters in John Wick 2. They help grow the mystery around the main character, keep adding to his legend. Because as far as the plot goes, it can be summed up in one line- handguns, shotguns, assault rifles, pencils, knives or hands- Wick will kill lots of people in the most inventive ways possible.'You stabbed the devil in the back. To him this isn't vengeance, this is justice'While director Chad Stahelski might have been a stuntman, but John Wick 2 is not all action. It is funny too, like horror movie funny. Incredible action pieces are followed up by tense, yet funny moments. Think Kill Bill Volume 1 and 2 rolled in one. Keanu Reeves is again perfect as the unkillable assassin, dispatching 128 people in the movie, in elaborately choreographed style, yet seeming lovable and hopeless romantic at the same time. Apparently ex-Special Forces folks trained him and that shows in his physical performance. In current form, close quarter armed or unarmed, he might even take on Bond, Reacher, Hunt and Bourne, all together, and make it out alive. All the while looking way better than those guys.'Tailor: Is this a formal event or a social affair? John Wick: Social. Tailor: How many buttons? John Wick: Two. Tailor: And what style? John Wick: Tactical...'While Wick is stylish, his style has both art and purpose. His impeccably tailored suit serves as his body armor. His moves have a dance like feel. The criminal world he belongs to has the same kind of resources that Bond has access to, yet crazily, has a code of honor. By the time the movie is over, you might be left wondering if there is a thing called 'too much.' Spoiler- The climax doffs its hat to another cult classic action flick- Enter the Dragon. Does Wick go one up on Bruce Lee? Watch it and decide- 10/10",10,9,16,19 February 2017
Rockstar," Everything rocked in Rockstar!
","It is difficult not to like Rockstar. The movie itself transcends many genres- biography, romance, and musical, and yet retains Imtiaz's trademark connect with modern day youth. It begins when a simpleton is told to find pain to succeed in music, who takes it as a joke at first, and in it search, finds his muse. The intensity of the relationship between the main protagonists and their portrayal by Ranbir and Nargis knocks the stuffing out of other purported Bollywood romances. Their chemistry is sizzling, and both do a stupendous job in making their changing relationship- platonic at first and then intimate, believable.The good in the movie is essentially the people behind it. In Nargis, we have an actress who in her very first outing has displayed that god gifted ability to mix sincerity with spice, and us ooglers have an equally ravishing alternative to Katrina. And what a Rockstar we have- Ranbir in probably his toughest assignment yet, plays the titular role with élan- people up North will vouch for the originality of his Jat accent, and he actually gets better as his role becomes multidimensional in the second half- that of a person unconditionally in love with someone unattainable, and a musician trying to find his place in the sun. And then there is this delightful cameo by the first rockstar of Bollywood. AR Rahman's score is worth a million hearings itself- and it would not have been so unless Mohit Chauhan was not singing, oh what talent, what talent (remember Silk Route, anyone?)And then there is Imtiaz who has this rare talent of making ordinary things look extraordinary. The movie itself is a labor of love- like Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Khamoshi, Imtiaz Ali has poured his heart out to make a love story that satiates himself i believe, if not necessarily the audience. I don't know why i like Imtiaz- is it the Jamshedpur connect, or is it because he makes simply beautiful films, which makes you want to be a part of them? In Rockstar we have gorgeous locations- from Hauz Khaas, to Prague, to Kashmir, the scenes stay will stay in your mind for ever. And yet, it is not without flaws. Unlike Jab We Met, I would not look forward to a second viewing, partly because of the movie's inconsistent pace, a 10-15 min shorter version would have made it a lot tighter, and I definitely wanted more of the tub thumping soundtrack because all the songs do not feature in the movie. However, as a musical, and as a love story, Rockstar remains a stellar effort.",8,0,0,23 November 2011
