E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," My favorite movie!
","E.T. is one of those movies that just keeps getting better! Elliott is very lovable and so are his siblings. E.T. is an amazing movie that is highly recommended! It's the story of a lonely boy, who happens to encounter an alien. E.T. can't be sweeter! It's my movie choice whenever I'm bored. After watching the movie for the first time, I was instantly in love! Now, I've watched it so many times, I lost count! Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job on this film. All the actors and actresses are great. Henry Thomas(Elliott)really is just great in this film. Drew Barrymore(Gertie)is adorable in the film! Robert MacNaughton(Michael)is really funny. Dee Wallace(Mary, but know as Mom)is perfect for the role as their mother! Peter Coyote(Keys)is a character that is serious, and keeps me on the edge of my seat! Everything about this movie is pure gold! Highly recommended!",10,0,0,17 July 2016
