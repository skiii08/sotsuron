Black Swan," Visually exciting and offers real horror, but over-scripted/directed and may seem contrived
","First let me start by saying that I didn't like the film much, but didn't dislike it much either. Rating a movie 7 in my benchmark means that I think it's worth watching for many other people, while certain people like me won't like it.While being labeled as a psychological thriller, the film has some horror and fantasy elements, which however, won't be that horrifying for any thriller fan. So it means any average audience is good to go and see this. But as I judge it from my personal view, the film's probably not going to appeal to those who don't like Shutter Island or Muholland Dr. However, it doesn't mean that Black Swan shares the same kind of twist as they do, by which I mean, the story's surely different.The overall feeling that I got from watching this film is that, the director and the script writers put tons of efforts to reflect the main character's psychological inner world. However, it falls flat for some reasons: First, the trick is pretty much a cliché. It's like old wine in a new bottle. The majority of shots telling her psychological responses are a depiction of what she thinks, which don't interact much with and affect the 'real' outside world or real persons out there, and this brings about little true substance to the movie itself and the idea it tries to express. Second, Black Swan sure has got its emotional content but from time to time it seems to be overdone. Though I don't deny the fact that Natalie Portman delivered a good performance, the acting itself seems rather overdone due to the overdone script. And her switch to the black swan that she's been longing for seems kind of tacked on only for the benefit of offering some visual excitement.While looking it on the bright side, many would love to see the inner spirit of a struggling soul. Black Swan did it deeply with a large amount of dedicated scenes. It'd be good as long as you didn't mind the trick being old. The music and shooting are both great, and the final dance sequence is enjoyable, both technically and artistically. Speaking of this, shooting the sequence could be a real tough job, which the crew handled flawlessly. Also, on the whole, the film has a very dark tone, which gets you glued as long as you are inclined to.If you're looking for an emotional journey that might drive you on, going for the film will never be a wrong choice. But if what you prefer is a clever story with witty twists, or something that's truly trying to EXPLORE rather than SHOW the so-called psychological stuff, you have to have a second thought before going to the cinema.",6,2,5,12 January 2011
Fury," Stuffed with one-liners in dialogue, but beyond a typical war epic if you're keen on battlefield depiction
","First allow me to apologize for not being comprehensive in the title, with which said, there's still a possibility that you'll not be satisfied with the depiction on the war zone if it is run-and-gun fight scenes you're looking for. But if you want to watch something rarely done for the war epic category, i.e. tank battles, the film's a lavish treat.There isn't much plot involved, so it's rather easy to follow. For audience unfamiliar with American English, you might want to watch it subtitled considering the concise expressions all over the place. It's not the typical affective drama where you get elegant written conversations, which don't even happen during the sequences meant to be touching, and these sequences strike as clichés whenever they do. Sometimes, you may find it much ado to ruin the pace. But on the other hand, due to the convincing performance from Pitt and Lerman, these emotional scenes get you immersed and care about the characters for the obvious charisma these guys carry along, although the storytelling seldom gets you think on the matters deeply. But it is also thanks to the simplicity that there is no ostentation available for criticism, as it never goes to the extent to preach philosophy overly, which makes the film all the more convincing and pleasant to enjoy.The portrayal of tank battles is definitely the highlight here, partly because of itself being a rarity, standing much oppositely to the more 'conventional' military gunfights or squad-based missions, and, also because of the cunning depiction which really earns a salute. Apart from the delicately built visual which spares no efforts on casting both grittiness and sumptuosity, the best about the battle scenes are the tactics of each battle which are meticulously planned and displayed; this helps develop the characters by rendering these protagonists intelligent and brave, and undoubtedly shows that their supremacy on the battlefield is credited for the wisdom and bravery flowing exclusively in their blood. Editing has been marvelously done, so has shooting, in such a way they, combined, deliver an unparalleled, unique and brutal representation throughout, accompanied by subtle sound effects that never gets in unwelcome. Every battle is staged with care so that they differ from one another, always offering a new flavour.To sum up, Fury is well crafted with attractiveness in mind. It's conscientiously tailored via all that's requisite for film-making for all its exquisite actions packed inside, while effectively shunning superfluous CGI's, which if used, might have abased itself. And if you're the kind of audience who doesn't abide by melodramas but desires pure entertainment, Fury is likely to gratify and surprise you with its great merits that make it outstanding.",9,2,5,22 November 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," A nice switch from the 2nd film and a great end
","As soon as the 1st Bourne film surfaced, it generated a large amount of hype due to its realism, which is rare to be seen in today's action films, not to mention Jason's wisdom is the power that pushes the pace on. And these two factors have since been carried over in the two sequels.First, the pace is incredibly fast and is definitely highlight in this Bourne film. To some degree, it's even set a brand new high bar for action thrillers in future, as IMO, it's probably the fastest-paced movie ever made. However, the way the crew created such a fast pace was more than intelligent. That said, the pace wasn't purely based on the amount of action sequences. Actually when compared to films like James Bond: The World Is Not Enough, the amount of action in Ultimatum is far much fewer, but that's adequate enough to give you real adrenaline. So, the story itself is very fast-paced as a whole. For instance there's one scene in Waterloo Station where there's not much action while it keeps your eyes stuck on the screen cuz the dialog really builds up a dangerous climax.As it's very paced up, not much plot can be expected of it this time around, but it turned out to be a nice decision. Both the 1st and 2nd Bourne films are plot-heavy, and they would've been bad if it was not for the plot. But as the story went clear, we've known enough about Jason's past, his present and what he's up against/to. And that's why I think less plot does right for this final piece.The action sequences were very well done. Hand-to-hand combats look on par with those in the 1st film, much better than these in the 2nd of course. Kali/Jeet Kune Do stuff did fine with nice choreography, no necessary curvy punch done either. Jason's IQ is as high too, which can be seen in many little surprises, which happen when he's met with some situations that normal (wisdom-wise) guys can't work out.The Bourne Ultimatum is a masterpiece for me, also for many ppl. :D It's one of the best films of all time, for its acting, directing, story and stunt works. The only major flaw is the shaky camera work, which gets a lil bit annoying at times, especially during the action sequences. But generally I think it's better done compared to the predecessor.9/10",9,1,2,30 May 2010
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Great violence film, but incredibly slow-paced and lacks story
","Kill Bill is not only a martial arts film, but also one where the violence is depicted in a stylish and bloody way. As a whole, the film was shot in an artistic way with great acting and artistic dialogs. Colors are simply gorgeous and the music is unbelievably profound.However, the pace of the film is incredibly slow. I'm not saying it lacks fight scenes. What it lacks is the story, so there's nothing to fill in the blank between action sequences. Sometimes ridiculously long shots occur with no obvious reason. What's also worth mentioning is, the last fight scene in the film is also slow as hell. Two women fight with sword and it's about ten to eleven hacks, while the fight scene lasts for several minutes due to some weird long shots where the two actresses stand still there doing nothing...As a whole, the film is a piece of art, but don't go looking for deep plot or thrilling pace. And I don't intend to recommend it to any Chinese or Asian audience who are very familiar with martial arts films since it's really slow and lacks story compared to others in the same genre.7/10.",7,4,7,12 July 2010
The Dark Knight," Great story, great visuals and high production value with sub-par action sequences
","Just like I said in my review's title, this film has many great things about it for its own good, while it doesn't serve quite well as an action flick. And let me start by talking about the dark side first.My biggest problem with the film is its relatively poor action sequences. Batman fights a bit slowly, which makes hand-to-hand combats look somewhat contrived at times. But I guess that was a choreograph issue. However, jumping down, flying and car chase sequences are all beyond awesome, among other things.Now here comes the reason why I loved this film. First, the story is considerably great! Even though it's a Sci-Fi movie in which those unbelievable gadgets also contribute to the story's extraordinariness, the plot is miles deeper than that in Bond films. Involving politics, psychological world of criminals, and themes like human nature is what makes it shine above other movies in this genre. As for the storytelling, Jonathan and Christopher Nolan have done a great job again too. There're pretty a lot of dialogs but oddly enough that doesn't feel slow-paced, even considering the lengthy running time.As for the acting, most did well, especially Heath Ledger's vivid, funny and engagingly strange portray of the Joker, who is the highlight of the whole film. And he overshadows Christian Bale's role of Batman in my view, who's only doing average in this film. But in general, this is not another hero-owns-everyone movie, since it puts the same amount of emphasis on bad guys, which is rare to be seen.8.5/10",8,1,3,26 July 2010
Saw," Very underrated. Perhaps the best horror film ever made.
","Overlooked by many so-called film critics as a low-quality horror piece with no taste and no so-called depth, Saw is one of the best horror films ever made and perhaps even the best among the best.The greatest part of the film, on the contrary to what most people believe before seeing it, is its highly logical and carefully arranged ultra-complex story rather than its presentation of blood and gore. It is the kind of movie where there are tons of totally unpredictable twists and the ending itself stands out as one of the most twisted ones in movie history. In my opinion the story is miles better than that in The Silence of the Lambs, and this alone makes Saw one of the greatest mystery drama films ever too, alongside Memento.Acting on the other hand, is sometimes a little contrived, but sometimes it becomes excessively vivid. Almost every actor/actress does average in average scenes but when horror strikes, their performances become highly believable all in a sudden.Despite the fact that it's not trying to teach you something or to educate you something helpful to being a better man (and forget it, because most films don't), it's a classic that everyone who likes plot- heavy dramas and who doesn't dislike gore/blood should see!Story: 9.8/10 Presentaion (sound/visuals): 9.5/10 Acting and directing: 8.3/10 Atmosphere: 9.0/10Overall: 8.8/10",9,2,4,6 October 2010
Inception," A milestone in innovation of cinematic stories, held back by subpar action sequences
","I'm a big fan of Nolan so I watched this movie with high anticipation, and it didn't disappoint. Talking about complexity, Inception's almost on the same level as Memento was. Which being more complex and harder to be understood depends on the audience themselves, because not everyone's able to bring themselves to correctly read the fantasized ideas which work as the whole basic setting of the film.It does have a lot to deal with dreams, subconsciousness, projections etc. However that's not what makes the whole thing standout. Nolan developed lots of his own original ideas that help make the story way more intriguing, such as the idea that time dilation takes place whenever you're dreaming and that drives your mind think faster down there than in reality, and that a dream can be dreamed within a dream; the dreamers can even achieve multiple layers of dreams and so on.Serving as a high fantasy tale, it manages to be a great suspense drama as well. As the story unfolds deeper and deeper, there'll be like two well-arranged big twists, along with some other touching twists, all of which let us see the character development and emotional depths of some characters so it helps to understand the motivation better and makes the film itself a worthy drama with depth.But ultimately, the film was held back by its action sequences, which are, let's say, not that memorable. There's hand-to-hand fight which aims for realism that's quite a good set piece. Apart from that, most action scenes are just plain and not fast-paced. It's kinda like the same problem with The Dark Knight, where the action scenes are just so- so too.Anyway, it's a great film and definitely a milestone in cinema history. And any Nolan's fan or Sci-Fi fan shouldn't miss it.",8,1,7,20 November 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Great fun, solid acting but not a good film
","This is a movie where solid acting, great art direction (costumes, buildings and decoration) and some funny comedy lines happen. There are even some sessions that feel a little bit yaoi-oriented (refer to Wikipedia), which might please Asian fans, especially girls, while for teenager boys and early twenties like me, it doesn't seem that strange due to the way we express our friendship being similar to that shown in this film. On the whole, the performance isn't contrived at all, even when NOT considering the fact that it's a comedy. The old London city looks awfully beautiful with many details that accurately captures and represents the feeling of the streets.But on the other hand, the plot isn't great. You probably won't even take it as 'good' if you like reasoning or logic that's supposed to be essential for detective fictions, you'd probably be disappointed. The reasons lie in two aspects. First, the reasoning portrayed in this movie relies way too much on professional knowledges; almost all the reasonings are built upon the knowledges of chemistry. Second, you don't get as many evidences and clues as Sherlock Holmes does; since the stuff he sees, or more literally, smells, are generally chemistry stuff, you won't know what he sees or smells or tastes until the end of the film. That said, you are totally impossible to solve the puzzle by yourself.So whether it's a film for you depends on your taste. If you're looking for some entertaining dialogs, good acting and beautiful scenes, you won't be let down. What's also worth mentioning is that the hand-to-hand combat in the film looks pretty decent too, but surely not as stunning as that in Bourne films or Matrix series.7.2/10",7,2,3,6 August 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," Touching, heartwarming yet powerful! One of the greatest films ever and one of the greatest novel adaptations ever.
","The Shawshank Redemption is a film telling that a wealthy banker, who's been wrongly prisoned for many years for being suspected of murdering his own wife, finally takes his revenge and redemption with the HOPE that never dies in his heart and his wisdom. The story's based upon Stephen King's novel of the similar name. But there are certain amount of differences.When it comes to the question 'why is it so excellent?', some may say that it's got a so-called great story and unpredictable twist near the end, but I don't take it that way. The plot in my opinion is average in terms of complexity and twists. Actually the twist is predictable from the very start where the film itself already gave you an obvious hint. But in terms of developing and building up the characters, the story's magnificent, while it becomes more epic in this adaption due to the differences from the book. There're some scenes that shock the audience like deaths of certain characters, which didn't happen in the original book. These scenes not only helped render a more hopeless and crueler world than that in the novel, but also built up Andy's and Redd's strong personalities with no doubt.The friendship between the two main characters is a highlight too. What's especially mentioning is that the film doesn't even have a single female character despite a very tiny one at the beginning, who didn't even say a word by the way... This separates it from other mindless Hollywood films which always tend to show women's charm totally. Friendship is the most cherished thing along with 'hope' here in this story, and sometimes friendship pulls us back into form and faith when we're lost - so does this movie!The acting and score are also beyond awesome, accompanied by well- arranged cinematography. Morgan Freeman's narration makes it even more special as it lets you see through the deeper thoughts of characters. At the meantime, the balance of emotion is well controlled so it never gets contrived.Some people who don't like the film either say the idea it's trying to teach us is great but falls simple and obvious, or think the scenes like Mozart's music scene is exaggerating. But I think neither of them makes sense, because great films use extraordinary events to teach you something, and that's what we called emphasis. As for that music scene, people longly prisoned in a hopeless place can be easily touched by the things that we, normal people can get easily, since for them, it's not easy to get.So, this is an honest film that doesn't pretend to be anything hard to understand while having its own depth, about friendship, hope and the spirit of never giving up when life gets tough. It's a must-see for everyone who loves great movies.",8,0,0,7 December 2010
Cube," A great show but feels as if it were coming out of nowhere
","Cube's a very alternative style that totally separates itself from any major horror/suspense drama. That said, you get some really intriguing setting here - some people get trapped in a big big cube and they're trying to get out with using their wisdom together.Along the way, some situation takes place and that's where the human nature of different kinds unfolds. Sure it reaches some depth but is held back by the story's simplicity. However, perhaps nothing way too complicated can be expected from such an adventure set in a cube apart from the outside world. When you look at the bright side, the film offers you a lot of entertaining moments just down in its own special setting and it's rather focused on its topic - being atmospheric. If it were lengthier, it would probably be more classic, though that's just my guessing.The movie does have something to deal with human nature. More specifically speaking, there are selfishness, desire for revenge for some trifles, and warmth in our hearts of course. It's generally believable but sometimes is ruined by certain exaggerated acting. The music score intensifies mood at times but sometimes it feels lacking, when you feel that there should be some...In general it's a great film, especially considering how it explores human nature while serving as a horror film but the setting feels like it's coming out of nowhere and totally unexplained; that's the part where Saw does better. After all, it's a must-see for horror fans.",8,0,1,2 December 2010
Gladiator," Not bad story, some solid acting, crafted with extremely well choreographed martial-arts action sequences
","Back when this movie was born, I didn't get the chance to watch it. I'm glad I did today, of course, the 10th anniversary remastered version.In general, it's a typical action-oriented Hollywood blockbuster, where there's not much plot involved. But this film successfully keeps its pace at a mid rate that doesn't make audience fall asleep, which is good for its genre. Compared to action thrillers like Bourne films, it lacks twists, while compared to formulaic ones like Kill Bill and 300, it still offers you a lot to see; not to mention that it's got a good ending.As for the acting, not THAT much can be pointed out as outstanding since for a historical epic like this, it's mainly about men's bravery and the like. But, Russell Crowe's portrayal as Maximus is beyond awesome! He really brought the character into life as well as some depth. And of course, he's looking handsome as always (said by me, a boy who's not gay :D, LOL). Other characters do well enough to keep the film go on, but perhaps it's due to the simplicity of the parts for them that they do just good but not great on the whole.On the other hand, directing, coloring (post-production), score and staging are all very well done. The colorful cinematography reaches state of art. Everything, ranging from constructions, sceneries, costumes to decorations of rooms, is beautifully colorful. Action sequences are where the film truly stands out. Apart from being well choreographed, there're also many little innovations to them that are very original.The major flaw is certain useless subplots that slow the already-not- fast pace down, especially in the 1st act. But that doesn't hurt much, as the later scenes' intensity makes up for it.8.5/10",8,1,4,6 September 2010
The Bourne Supremacy," Awesome plot, storytelling and some standout logical stuff but not as good as the other two
","The Bourne Supremacy is the least favorite Bourne film of mine so far (you know there's gonna be a forth one). But it still stands higher than most action thrillers out there today.One of the improvements that I really appreciate from it is the bigger amount of scenes that show us Jason Bourne's incredibly high IQ. Scenes such as the trick where Bourne gets to know Pamela Landy's room number secretly and the Berlin foot chase where Jason escapes the police in a very intelligent way are definitely highlights. And they're generally the things we, ordinary people, are able to do, despite the fact that most of us can't bring ourselves to such intelligent solutions. The final car chase in Moscow is also one of the best in movie history in my opinion, which is better than the overrated one in The Dark Knight as I believe.As for the story, it's highly logical and intellectual, aside from only one minor plot hole where we've no idea how that happens (how Jason finds the only alive Treadstone operative besides himself hasn't been explained). Some people found the plot hard to follow, while for me, it's very well written. And depending on your taste, you might prefer it to the story of the first one or not.However, there are certain things that keep it from being an excellent film like The Bourne Identity and The Bourne Ultimatum. First, it lacks the adequate amount of action sequences that keep viewers' eyes glued to the big screen. Also, though I'm by no means an opponent of shaky camera work, it's obviously been overused in this film. In general they don't bother me, but that supposed-to-be-gorgeous martial-arts combat was terribly ruined by this method of shooting. Apart from this one, there're also some weak moments like the car chase in India and the tram scene. The ending of the movie, though not cliffhanger, kind of has an unfinished sense; thus by watching that you'd hunger for a sequel. Above are the factors making this a lesser movie than the other two in the series IMO.The character development on the other hand is well arranged. Bad guys in this film are shown as being corrupted and the motivation for the way they act is believable. While it's less emotional than its predecessor, that however adds to the film-noir style it delivers, which definitely works for its own good.8.0/10",8,3,4,7 August 2010
