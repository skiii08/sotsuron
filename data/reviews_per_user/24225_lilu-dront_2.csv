The Lobster," If you appreciate true art of film
","I don't leave reviews on this site simply because it won't change anything. But in this case I couldn't resist. So many negative reviews.. so much criticism and accusation.. Yes this film is very bizarre and it's not a light comedy when while watching one you don't have to use your brain. Yorgos Lanthimos is a brilliant Greec director and writer. He has very outstanding style which you can recognize. If you liked The Lobster I would highly recommend to watch 'Alps' and 'Dogtooth'.The cast in The Lobster is made of wonderful actors: Farrell (who in my opinion just gets better and better) , Weisz, LÃ©a Seydoux, Whishaw, Reilley. They create this extremely strange world, where being single is like a plague or AIDS.. On the outside it shows the struggle ofsingle people in the outside world, but deeper it simply reveals main issue: how judgmental the society is. All I wanted to say was that this is one of those films which is not for general audience. But it's incredible (that's my personal opinion).",10,3,7,2 June 2016
Requiem for a Dream," The film about our addictions.
","Well, this is my first review(on this site) and i chose 'Requiem..' because i find it utterly underestimated. I'm not a teenager and in fact not a fan of Leto. But i do appreciate Aronofsky's work. For those who haven't seen this film yet i would suggest to think first. If you are 'easy,pleasure,funny or cool movie' kind of viewer then don't waste your time because after you could just one of those who talk sh..t about this film. 'Requiem for a dream' is not a film about a drug addiction, but about addiction - period. We all have one. If someone says that he isn't addicted to anything - he's a terrible lier. We all have this at list one thing which in excess. And excess is vicious, it's self destructing and sometimes dreadful and even disgusting. That's what Darren wanted to show, that was his point. For all deep thinkers and appreciators of high quality cinematography i would highly recommend to see it!",10,0,1,18 August 2012
