The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," what a bad movie!
","I wasn't a fan of the first 2 Hunger Games movies. I thought that the first one was a bad version of Battle Royal (yes, no matter how the writer denies it, there are too many similarities to the story for it to be a coincidence). The second movie I just found terrible. I didn't plan on going to see this third movie, but my friend convinced me to go anyway. I didn't plan on reviewing this movie, but I was so annoyed by it that I had to. The writing for this movie is just awful. I can't blame the actors for their performances, there is only so much they can do with the material. I think they did okay with what they had, but that didn't make it good. Overall the movie was just boring. The pacing was really slow. Not a lot seemed to be happening. And just when I thought it couldn't get worse, Katniss starts to sing a horrible song. And when I thought it couldn't get worse than that, a choir starts to sing along with her! I would never ever recommend this movie to anyone. I must not be the right audience for it. What I would have liked to have seen in this movie was Katniss and Peeta get together and be forever referred to as either KatPee or PeeNiss. I'd settle for any one of those.",4,25,37,18 December 2014
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Great Spider Man movie!
","First off, I'd like to say that I really did not like the first Amazing Spider-Man, so my expectations were really low coming in to part 2. I was pleasantly surprised by it though. This movie has action, comedy and drama in a perfect balance. I was worried that there would be too many bad guys in this movie, but they did it just right. If I had one complaint, it would be that Harry Osborne's transition to the Green Goblin could have been done differently, it felt a bit rushed to me, but the rest of the movie makes up for it. Another highlight for me was the soundtrack and score of the movie. The music when Electro is in Times Square is amazingly well done.Overall I liked this movie a lot because it really felt like the Spider-Man I knew from the comics. There was a mid credits scene of the X-Men: Days of Future Past movie, but I really didn't like that scene.",8,37,65,24 April 2014
Whiplash," exceeded my expectations
","I was really looking forward to seeing this movie and I have to say, it did not disappoint! I have seen a lot of movies this year, but this is the best I've seen so far. The actors all do a great job. Teller is great as an aspiring drummer. His drumming is amazing. J.K. Simmons really steals the show. He is absolutely great in this movie. It won't surprise me if he takes home an Oscar for his performance. The music is great as well, if you like jazz. The movie builds up to a climax and it delivers. The final scene of this movie is the best ending I've seen in a long time. Most of the times movies don't live up to your expectations. I'm glad to say that this one did more than meet my expectations. I recommend it to anyone, even if you don't like jazz.",9,1,4,6 December 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," looks great, story not so...
","First off, I'd like to say that I enjoyed the first Hobbit movie. I didn't think it was great, but it was enjoyable. I had problems with the second movie though. Especially the final scene in the mountain kept dragging on. And this is the first thing that bugged me of this third Hobbit movie. The entire Smaug storyline could have been wrapped up at the end of the second movie. The opening scene with Smaug only lasted a few minutes. They could have kept the final scene of the Desolation of Smaug shorter, thereby making it more interesting, and added the demise of Smaug to the second movie and even have time to set up things for this third movie as a cliff hanger of some sorts.Now, about this third movie. Overall the movie had great visuals. I did have some problems though. In the first scenes with legolas his face looked like it was cgi or something. There was something very off with him. The same goes for the face of Dain. It kind of looked like bad console game cgi. Other than that, I really enjoyed the look of the movie. The landscapes were beautiful. The details in the armours looked great. The story was lacking though. It really shows that the source material wasn't enough for 3 movies. The story could have been told in a better way in just 2 movies. I also had a problem with how the writers tried to connect this story with the Lord of the Rings, by mentioning the Strider to Legolas...That's just bad writing.I also found that the movie was lacking in suspense. The battles looked great, but there wasn't really any feel of suspense in them.I'm not sure if I would recommend this movie to anyone. It wasn't bad, but there are better ways to spend your time...",6,2,5,18 December 2014
Godzilla," was this supposed to be a godzilla movie?
","The movie looked great. Special effects were really well done. The cast was absolutely great, but this didn't feel like it was a monster movie. I came in expecting to see a Godzilla movie. To see monsters fight each other. For some reason the director decided that whenever Godzilla is about to get in a fight it would be better to cut to something else. The first time it happened I was kinda annoyed that they didn't show the fight. The second time it happened it got frustrating. Even the final battle didn't show enough of the monsters fighting. This movie could have been really good had they actually shown the fights. I feel cheated. I came out of the movie not satisfied. If I knew they weren't going to show the fights, then I wouldn't have gone to see the movie in theaters. Too bad really, 'cause the rest of the movie looks great. It's just not a monster movie.The best comparison I can think of is that when you watch a porn movie and just when things are about to get interesting, they show you news or sports clips instead of the action.",4,2,4,22 May 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Now...This is what action movies should be like!
","The movie starts out with a bang and it seems like it never ends. Not that that is a bad thing. It's a thrill ride from beginning to end. The action scenes are amazingly well done. The acting is great, though I did think that some of the wives could have done a better job at it. The characters are really interesting. This movie finally gets the female action hero right. The movie is as much a Mad Max movie as it is a Furiosa movie. The story is not that complicated, but it has layers of deeper meaning to it, which you can choose to ignore and just enjoy an action movie, or give it some thoughts. Either way, it's a very good movie. The desert landscape is beautiful! The vehicles and machines are very detailed and look great. What also stood out to me was the score by Junkie XL. He really outdid himself here. During one of the amazing action scenes I thought to myself: 'Holy sh*t! The score is absolutely amazing!'.I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone! I've seen it in IMAX and it looked amazing. Hope to go see it again soon.",9,5,12,21 May 2015
