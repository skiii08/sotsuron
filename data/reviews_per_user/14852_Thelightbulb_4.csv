The Ring," An unbiased view
","I haven't seen the original Japanese version of this film, so i was able to watch the film without having to compare it to Ringu. As a result i quite liked this film. I found it to be genuinely scary and well acted. Unlike most horrors that are produced in Hollywood nowadays this film turns its back on 'teen horror', and the opening sequence can perhaps be seen as a kind of tongue in cheek rejection of teen based horror movies. The storyline in this movie manages to captivate you into the film; you find yourself caring for the main characters as well as feeling a fascinating mixture of pity and horror for the family featured in the video tape.Overall therefore the film comes across as a decent horror movie, with the director Gore Verbinski wisely using suspense over blood to scare the audience. Verbinski is triumphant in so far as he has created a film whose dark mood manages to leave an unsettling psychological effect on the audience by the end of the film. The main actors too are in good form, in the shape of Australiasians Naomi Watts and Martin Henderson. Another major plus for this film is the cinematic use of colouring. There is a distinct use of dark greenish imagery throughout this film which greatly heightens the gloomy atmosphere that Verbinski clearly wants to create.That said this film is not without criticism. The ending is unsatisfactory and damages much of the good work of the film up until that point. There is also little attempt made at making sense of just who the little girl really was, and why she was doing what she was. The boy too is a bit tedious, his character almost seems to be saying to the audience 'we wanted Haley Joe Osmond but he is now too old and too expensive.' That aside this is a decent horror movie, though had i seen the original, like with so many other Hollywood remakes i suspect i would have been disappointed with this film.",7,2,4,24 October 2003
12 Angry Men," If you only ever see one Black and White movie, make this it.
","I watched this film for the first time, when it was shown at about 1 o'clock in the morning. I made an effort to see it as it is rated as one of the best movies ever made, however I must admit that I watched it with a sense of reluctance as I'm not a great one for old 'classics'. This film blew me away however; how ignorant can I be about old films? How many other pre-1960s gems are there out there that I haven't seen? What strikes me most about this film is how progressive it is for its day. Indeed the issues this film makes about American society of the 1950s, still ring true for western society today. This film concerns twelve jurors debating the sentence of an 18 year old Puerto Rican boy who on the face of it, has no real alibi. However one man, played brilliantly by Henry Fonda, is ill-at ease putting a young boy to death without even debating his case, much to the despair of the other jurors. What follows is a brilliant piece of film making, slowly revealing many of the juror's complex characters to the audience as they react to Fonda's concerns with their own mix of metal scars, prejudices and insecurities. What especially struck me about this film is how ordinary most of the characters are, none of the jurors are shown to be especially bad men, indeed most are portrayed as honest everyman type people. The use of ordinary characters is the films master-stroke because as one by one they begin to question their initial instincts, the flaws of society that have let this Puerto Rican boy down are presented to the audience. Tragically it appears that many of the issues that were beginning to be discussed in the 1950s have only got worse. For me there is one immortal comment in this film: one of the jurors, a man in his 50s says that the youths of today have no respect and have changed so much for the worse since his day. How ironic is it that some grumpy old men of today who may not even of have been born when this films was made, still say exactly the same thing? Finally a quick look at the cast shows that Fonda aside many of the cast were only moderately successful after this film. I think that's a shame as everyone of these actors is excellent and plays their part in making it one of the best films of all time. However within the cast there are a couple of treats; look out for Jack Klugman (Quincy) and John Fieldler who is the voice of many of Disney's characters such as Piglet. I urge you all, if you have not yet seen this film, please do so now.",10,363,405,22 September 2005
Brokeback Mountain," Simply a great love story
","When I came round to watching this film my fear was that this would simply be an average love story that had been massively over-hyped because of the star cast and of course the homo-sexuality that had caused so much controversy. Thankfully this fear turned out to be unfounded as this is in fact a beautiful film. Brokeback Mountain boasts a wonderful story, breathtaking scenery and above all a magnificent cast. While all actors and actresses do a wonderful job in portraying the story of two gay cowboys kept apart by the necessity to live a 'normal' life, it is Heath Ledger who shines above all else in this film. The heart of this film lies in the dilemma that Ernis Del Mar (Ledger) has to face, one life he cannot allow, his love for Jack Twist (Gyllenhall), and the other life, that of a family man, he is not really made for. Ledger is virtually unrecognisable from the pretty boy characters he normally portrays, as he grabs the audiences hearts with his not-so-bright, rugged Texan character, struggling to come to terms with his dual life. Jake Gyllenhall is excellent also, while Ann Hathaway goes along way to prove she is truly an actress of tremendous ability and shake of her teen actress past. Director Ang Lee does a tremendous job of creating a wonderful love story without sensationalising the home-sexuality of Twist and Del Mar. Instead this film is about the love of two human being for each other with a story that put Brokeback Mountain up there with the best romantic films ever made. This film deserves to be viewed as such and not as a bi-polarised political statement pitting 'Liberal' Hollywood against the bible bashers.",9,18,20,29 March 2006
Munich," The cold hard truth
","War and violence are bad, we all know that, but most of us accept that sometimes under the most extreme circumstances it is necessary. Steven Spielberg's Munich explores the actions of the Israeli government's response to the massacre of the Israeli wrestling team at the 1972 Munich Olympic Games, and whether all the subsequent bloodshed was justified. Under the leadership of the patriotic Avner (Eric Banner), a group of five unofficial Mossad operatives (Including Daniel Craig) set out to exact revenge on a list of 11 men that the Israeli government say are responsible for masterminding the 1972 Black September slaughter.This film is truly remarkable, and if not as poignant as Schindler's list it certainly comes close to being one of Spielberg's greatest films. The key to this film being so great is the cold hard truth it tells about the fine line between appropriate response and bloodthirsty vengeance. Many people die in this film both Jewish and Palestinian, but not once is death shown to be glorious or satisfying. Indeed as the Mossad squad go about their duties, the consequences of their actions weigh heavy on them to the extent of breaking point. The real life events that this film are based on could quite conceivably be an action vehicle for a Chuck Norris, or an Arnold Swarznegger type film, killing all the bad guys and helping to make the world a better place, but instead Spielberg gives a balanced and thoughtful insight into the conflict between the Israeli's and the Palestinians.Ultimately Spielberg underlines what many of us fear about the world today, violence breeds violence and solves nothing. The one point this film really rams home is that the actions of Israel did not make the world any safer or better, they made it worse. It is entirely understandable watching Avner's decent into paranoia and despair. We see a Jewish patriot haunted by the fate of the murdered athletes, fail to get any sense of justice or satisfaction from his actions as guilt and fear overcome him. Eric Bana, who was already well regarded for roles in Troy and Chopper amongst other films, is superb portraying Avner and now surely stands up there amongst the greatest Hollywood actors of today. The normally bland Daniel Craig is also surprisingly good as a supporting actor as are all the cast, especially Geoffrey Rush and Michael Lonsdale.If you're looking for some lightweight action entertainment I would suggest you avoid this film at all costs, however if you want to see stark reality on the futile nature of revenge and the dark nature of mankind then this film cannot be missed!",10,4,6,24 April 2006
