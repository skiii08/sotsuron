Hereditary," A24 does it again (not in a good way)
","Looking back on the film, my appreciation for it slowly begins to grow but it has yet to mesmerize me as 'one of the best horror movies in years'. 
I did not see it at all as a horro movie and very much so more a psychological thriller. The movie definitely has its moments of tension but many of them just seem to fall short of the true horror film delivery. 
The acting in the film was phenenonal except for the pathetic attempt of crying from Peter played by Alex Wolff. As for Toni Collete she takes charge and captivates you while on film.
The movie had such capability of being a breathe of fresh air in film but unfortunately A24 yet again managed to fabricate their false hope that they potray in all of their films. They simply attempt to be too artsy and leave it all up for interpretation. Just yet another lackluster and absurd ending from the production studio. I would consider this to be heavily to comparable to 'It Comes At Night' but with much better acting and execution. Hereditary had so much potential to make up for the slow burn that this movie was in the end but fell so short with its nonsense.",5,4,9,13 June 2018
