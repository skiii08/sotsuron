Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Hate this movie
","I'm sorry but i have to say this movie sucks ass. i had high hopes with being a fan of the other three movies but i hated this one. It was not funny at all, the storyline is crap, most of the characters aren't in it that made the other movies good, there was no chemistry between the characters. Penelope Cruz got on my nerves. The ridiculous love story between that guy and the mermaid, what the hell was all that about. One of biggest disappointments for a long time. I'm afraid i won't be rushing to the stores to buy the DVD when its released, because if i have sit through this mickey mouse made movie i will have to kill myself. s**t at it's best.",2,0,1,15 June 2011
