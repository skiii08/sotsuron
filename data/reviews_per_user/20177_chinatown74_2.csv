Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Get over it already
","Dreadfully dull.  Yeah, I was swept up by the Star Wars hype when the original movie was released.  I was just a kid.  I grew up.  Yeah, Star Wars is a fun movie, but the plot is paper thin and that dialogue---yikes! With each subsequent continuation of the story, I was caught up in the hype. Still a kid, mind you.  What happened?  Well, I grew up.  Saw the movies again, took them for what they are...good old fashioned entertainment. I'm not surprised at how hooked people are on this series.  They are fun. Kool-Aid was pretty tasty when I was a kid, too.",1,1,3,14 November 2002
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Great fun.
","There's no need to go on and on about this movie.  It's lighthearted, thanks to Johnny Depp and the occasional nod to the Disney theme park attraction which inspired it, and it's the sort of movie you have in mind when you think of seeing a good, fun pirate/adventure movie.  If you want to see some Academy Award winning film with the requisite brave character who dies from some terrible misunderstood malady, don't waste your time with this movie. If you want to have some fun, a few laughs, and a reminder of good, old-fashioned Saturday matinee popcorn adventure then go see this.  Even better, go get Disney's 'Treasure Island'  classic and watch it before you see 'Pirates of the Caribbean'---really get yourself in the mood.",7,1,2,10 July 2003
