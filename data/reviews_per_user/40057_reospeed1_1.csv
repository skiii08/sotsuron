Sucker Punch," WAY over hyped in Trailer
","I went to see this movie purely for the action sequences and special effects based on the trailer. I ignored the IMDb rating of less than a 7.0 and spent my money at a movie theater to see it ANYway. Bad move. The movie story is drawn out--they have to get 5 things to get out of the asylum. It takes almost the entire movie just to get 3 of them and all of the fighting sequences are just fluff between this story line. They have absolutely no purpose to the actual characters or story line in that they don't further the real life story. Instead, you just get to go into her dream life while she's being 'used/sexually enslaved.' After the second item is captured, these 'going into her alter ego/mind' got very old, very quick. Too bad that only got us to 2 of the 5 items they needed to get out. We still had 3 more left?!!? Sheesh.Lesson learned--don't ignore IMDb's ratings. I was hoping for more--I went to see Avatar JUST for the action and effects; not the lame story line and I thoroughly enjoyed that movie. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for Sucker Punch. The action scenes weren't good enough to overcome such a deplorable story line. The real irony is that the sucker punch is, the actual movie. The first punch is the price of a movie ticket. The sucker punch is giving you a crappy movie after paying so much. BLAH! And the whole story being about women who are being held as sex slaves/forced prostitution--really? It was just too dark and depressing of a story line which D R U G on and onnnnnnnnnnnn. Blyeahgh! Thumbs down!!!! Who wants to watch stuff about fake sex slaves when we see it all the time in the news these days. It's bad enough that it happens in real life. I don't want to have to pay money to go see a movie based on it.There were a FEW good action sequences. But how many times can a woman do twists in the air to avoid being shot by a bullet? I counted 3 in one sequence. 3! Think of a different move already. It was overplayed beFORE the FIRST time you saw it in this movie (thanks to several other movies including the likes of Kung Fu Panda for goodness sakes).",5,3,7,1 April 2011
