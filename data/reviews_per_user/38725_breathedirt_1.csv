The Equalizer," Breathtaking, phenomenal, astounding, remarkable!
","There's always something to improve but I had to give this movie 10/10. It movie was simply remarkable, and even though the story was predictable to an extent, It seemed to me as if every scene of the movie was carefully planned, directed, reviewed and redirected to make it look meaningful and extraordinary. At the very beginning there are several scenes shot at a small cafeteria where Denzel goes to read books and which also a young escort girl frequents. When they are having a conversation, the escort girl surprises Denzel with her knowledge of people - the small clues she learned to observe about people when working as an escort ('I'm Teri.' 'Bob.' 'You don't look like a Bob. You look like a Robert. Robert reads books like this. Bob watches TV.'). When she is severely beaten up by her pimp, Denzel decides to come back from his retirement and bring justice one last time. He then kills her pimp and everyone else in the room who underestimated him because of his age and calm personality. When Nicolai (Marton Csokas) comes to the city to clean up the mess and get rid of the killer (Denzel), he gathers all the information available until he narrows down the suspects to Denzel and pays him a visit impersonating a police officer investigating a murder (when leaving - 'I'll be in touch.' 'Don't you want to leave me your card, officer, in case I remember anything? That's what you policemen usually do, right?' 'Must have given them all out.' 'How did you find me?'). Last but not least, the ending fighting scene was simply phenomenal - it was like Home Alone for adults - Denzel as Kevin and Marton with his mercenaries as the burglars who in this R-rated version didn't end up in jail. By the way, I really don't understand the negative reviews here. Enjoy!",10,1,3,28 June 2018
