The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," Best movie yet
",I am a Huge twilight fan i have read all the books and have seen all the movies. I think that this last one is by Far the Best movie. This movie did an excellent job on making you feel/understand how much Edward and Bella are in love. When you read the books that is one thing that you completely understand. This movie finally gets the point across. i think the honey moon was great...great love scenes. The special effects with Bella being sick. they did an excellent job. I have already gone to the movie twice. and i am going to see it again tonight. I love twilight. and these people are saying 'it took too long' and 'it shows Bella and Edward kissing too much' well than don't go see it. that is what the books are about so there for that is what the movie is about. if you love the books you will love the movie. i could have sat there longer. i think they should remake all the other ones like this one. i cant wait to own this one. i am not sure why the reviews are so bad. i just hope they don't let this effect the next movie. i hope they make it just like this one. i am happy sitting there for 3 hours for the movie. Love it...see it see it again.,Null,3,10,21 November 2011
