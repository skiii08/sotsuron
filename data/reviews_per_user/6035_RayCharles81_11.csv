Walk the Line," One of the Best and Most Beautiful Movies of the 2000s- An Unsung Masterpiece
","This movie is just super. Each scene is perfectly directed and edited with so much depth and beauty in the cinematography, acting, style, and realism. Although this is not an obvious selection to fall into a category of masterpieces, I'm surprised to say that it actually is one, despite it being a genre one wouldn't expect for that label.The performances are just stunning (both Witherspoon and Phoenix actually sang all of those songs), and the story has so much beauty in it. Perhaps the most amazing thing about it is that this is supposed to be a biographical movie, but it catches a modern wave of modern pop culture relation that doesn't make it feel too old or outdated due to its style, yet at the same time you are in awe that this really is Cash and June Carter.In other words, you don't even need to have ever heard of Johnny Cash or June Carter or have been an actual fan of theirs to actually appreciate the fundamental humanity of the story. This is truly in my Top 50 Movies of All Time, and I'm not even a fan of love stories, biopics, or musically-based movies.",9,2,2,26 January 2020
Knives Out," Hilarious Dark Comedy
","Not everyone will love this movie, but I was pleasantly surprised at how hilarious it was. I was not expecting anything really that good, but it had me entertained all the way, and there were parts of it that adhered to classic moviemaking formula. It was a just slightly too silly at times, but it just worked for me. I think this is one I could watch again, but time will tell.",8,4,9,9 January 2020
The Irishman," Most of the Critics of This Movie
","Are revealing everything wrong with society in today's world, and it's tied to the fact that they are also Marvel and DC comic book groupies, as well as Star Wars Episode 73; The Rise of Leah and Episode 91; Jabba the Hut's Background Story anticipators.Rather than respect these accomplished and proven great actors and the director for 5 decades of excellence and classic performances, they long for one of their B-list younger actors to have showed up and made an appearance. There is no respect for character or their elders. They would rather live in fantasy delusion of the Star Wars Empire and planets that don't exist, or live in a city like Gotham or Superman's city...again and again and again. They probably couldn't find Dayton Ohio or Philadelphia Pennsylvania on a map.This movie isn't as fast paced for them as Fast and the Furious part 8 or the remake of Baby Driver. There's no zombies or dragons roaming around to cause them arousal. There's no Knight King and zombie death armies or villains wearing masks, costumes, or capes. So they can't get into it since their reality is too distorted. To compensate, they focus on attacking 3 of the 'proven' greatest actors in the history of cinema for their superficial looks based on the CGI. They would rather have one of the young pretty boys who can't act but is a generic cardboard cutout who just came off of the casting couch play the younger roles. There's no respect for their elders, but only respect for The Emporer, Darth Vader, The Scarecrow, The Joker and whatever other 100th character remake they are looking forward to seeing.Also, some of them don't even like Goodfellas that much, but they are citing it to gain some credibility to their review. They probably dozed off during Goodfellas at many of the quiet conversation parts and husband and wife scenes, but then they woke up for Pesci stabbing somebody and when they jumped the guy at the bar after insulting Pesci, and then they took a nap until the ending when Liotta talks to the camera. But that's it. They were never fans of these guys anyway, and just Goodfellas bandwagoners.In summary, don't watch this if you can't appreciate a realistic, true story and great multi-award winning actors who are icons. This is for mature audiences only. It's a relatively mild-paced movie loaded with attention to detail, truly excellent acting performances, and it's based on a true story during the Kennedy and Nixon presidencies. If you are looking for Caped Crusaders, untalented young B-list actors who can't act, and some cliched horror movie, then you will surely be disappointed.As for Scorcese movies, I will take this over the ridiculously overrated and overhyped 'The Wolf of Wall Street' (just an awfully overrated and almost a bad movie), 'Hugo', 'Shutter Island', and yes, even 'The Departed', which is the best of the four mentioned. The Departed was very good, no doubt, but for me, this is just better than it.",10,12,25,29 November 2019
The Irishman," Don't Listen to the Haters. It's Fine. Compared to What Most Oscar-Buzz Films Have Been the Last Five Years This is Much Better
","Look at the ridiculously boring and horrible films that have been 'acclaimed' over the past five years, or even ten years. It's like the standard of movies has dropped so low that many people, especially pretentious people, actually think that bad movies are good or that slightly above average movies are 'masterpieces'. Yeah, Hollywood is desperate these days in producing quality.Have no fear. The Irishman suffices. It's a little long, but it is not bad at all. Disregard any 1, 2, 3, or 4 star reviews; it is definitely not that bad. Those giving this movies 1-4 stars are probably Marvel comic book fans and Star Wars prequel fans.It's at least a 7 objectively.",10,9,20,29 November 2019
Dunkirk," Don't listen to IMDb trolls reviews. Its a pretty great movie. 86% audience score.
","If you look at the reviews on here, you'll see most people either love it or hate it, and a few people find it good but not great. However, the latter is less pronounced. The reason why is because only the most passionate people write reviews for popular and critically acclaimed movies such as this. I'm just writing this to actually help people who may be on the fence about watching it and like me, may not be sure which reviews to believe to make their decision. However, the audience Cinemascore is very high with an average of about 85%, maybe more, RT is around 83%, and of course here it's 8.7 after 50k + ratings currently. So, analyzing that, you'll find the vast majority of people do not agree with the negative reviews or really any actual rating below an 8. Anyone who rates below an 8 is in the vast minority. And this is not to include a Metacritic score of 94, with about a dozen top critics giving it a perfect score of 100. Nolan movies always attract haters. Heck, on IMDb any critically acclaimed or pop movie attracts lots of trolls, haters, and negative reviews. So don't listen to the MINORITY that vote it below 8 or are highly critical. They're either trolls, Nolan haters, or they didn't see superheroes in capes so we're disappointed a summer movie was actually artistically made.Now, that being said, let me give you my brief review: Visually speaking, Dunkirk is amazing and awesome. It's a little like Gravity in that way that the visuals alone are enough to make it a good movie experience. They're stunning. The film is shot like an old classic, silent war film with very little dialogue, relatively speaking. There is dialogue, but just not nearly as much as most war films you've seen. Simply put, this is visual storytelling, perhaps like silent era films in some ways, but with modern day technology. But not to worry, the film grips you from the opening scene and is riveting with nonstop action sequences. Personally, I found it hard to look away, my eyes glued to the screen. In other words, if you just accept it as a visual war movie and an artistically made one, there is no need for excess dialogue; it's good enough as is to rivet and immerse you in the battle of Dunkirk. Technically, and visually, it's about perfect. You feel right away that this is shot like an Oscar contender, and that is sustained throughout. It very likely will get many nominations including Best Picture and Director. Personally, I thought it was great. There's no wasted scenes, it goes by fast (only about 90 minutes), it's nonstop action, with beautiful scenery and scenes. It plays out like a heroic victory for the allies due to several heroes including a pilot in a dog fight. This is a 4/4 **** movie with no weaknesses other than if you're into artistic writing it doesn't develop characters. But the story's essence is to put you right into the middle of the action. I liked this more than Private Ryan (9/10) and Hacksaw Ridge (8/10). Take that for what you will. It's just more immersive, tight, shorter, and visually astounding. I liked that there were no wasted scenes.So in conclusion, on this one, believe the 10 or so top critics who gave it a perfect 100 score on metacritic, and the audience who gave it an 86% overall. That's telling you most people loved it. Don't listen to the negative critics on IMDb. They made me doubt its worth, but once I started watching it I loved it and knew they were in the wrong. 9/10 (no less than 8)",9,3,11,23 July 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Good, Refreshing, Non-Comic Book-Movie, with Great Acting, Directing, Editing, and Lots of Fun
","I really enjoyed this movie. It's just a lot of fun. It's very interesting and different. Most of the movie is DiCaprio's Rick Dalton struggling to stay relevant and keep getting work as an aging actor, and the realities that occur on the sets of his shows.Pitt is very entertaining as Dalton's carefree stunt double, Cliff Booth, who- legend has it- once challenged Bruce Lee to a fight on set and beat him. And Margot Robbie is delightful, charming, beautiful, and charismatic as young, up-and-coming starlet Sharon Tate, who just got married to famous filmmaker Roman Polanski.You can enjoy a ride through 1969 Los Angeles, passing through the Playboy Mansion, the Hollywood Hills, Burbank, along the freeway, down Ventura, and all the way to Chatsworth, to Spahn Ranch, where a group of hippies are gathering. Rick and Cliff have been in showbusiness and Hollywood for a while, and they have noticed how hippies have begun showing up around town, hitchhiking, and stirring trouble at times.This is one of Tarantino's best films, and it's because he doesn't overindulge as much as usual. His directing is more toned-down and writing more reserved. There is more of a sense of realism in Once Upon a Time than anything sensational, like his last five movies or so. In this way, I guess you can say that the film in his catalogue that comes closest to this one is Jackie Brown.This movie is more concerned with the realities of Hollywood in 1969, and the realities of the industry for a few various different actors getting work. As such, it is a lot of fun and full of laughs, a quirky style, and a good time.It might just be me, but I almost find this kind of movie nonexistent out of Hollywood in recent years; it seems that if it's not CGI, comic book, Star Wars, or other movies with lots of explosions (usually unoriginal, done before, or remakes), then it hardly gets made or any attention.Fortunately, Tarantino has given us something more down to earth, historical, and true-to-life with a cast of great actors who bring their A-games to their roles. This is definitely a movie not to take too seriously, but just to sit back, immerse yourself in the time period/era, and just have a good time. If you get the sense of humor and quirks on display at times, you will definitely do just that.",8,16,35,28 July 2019
1917," Imagine 'Roma' and 'The Revenant' as a War Video Game....All in One Take
","Listen, it's not a 'bad' movie at all; in fact, it is pretty good and pretty well made. Mendes is a good director so you wouldn't expect anything less, but wow this movie has major issues and flaws. I really did like watching it for 'one time', but I won't ever watch it again, and that alone is the sign of a movie that is not very good, certainly not a 'classic'. Some parts are really frustrating, and that's never a good sign.The cinematography is brilliant and ambitious, but the story's implausibilities, poor character development, lack of realism, and deux machina really were a surprise to me since it won the Golden Globe. I was not expecting such an unrealistic film after it won the award. I actually now question the Golden Globe's motives and authority in handing out awards after this won. Cinematography, yes, but story and plot absolutely not.This is a big fail of a movie if they are taking it seriously and pawning it off as award worthy. It just does not suffice. In a nutshell, take 1/2 (half) of Saving Private Ryan for its quality, and nothing more.",5,13,33,10 January 2020
The Dark Knight," Mindblowing
","I thought I was getting a clever comic book movie. Instead, I got a profound, chilling introspection on good vs evil with allegorical references to God vs Satan, good vs evil, and social-political and true life realities that made me cry as the credits rolled at just the powerful, brilliant fil experience it was.I was enthralled and mesmerized with what the director and writers were doing to something that was only supposed to be a Batman movie. I've now seen it at least 10 times, and I still get the same feeling. This is big budget, blockbuster filmmaking at its absolute best for the ages, a top 10 movie of all-time.",10,3,5,24 November 2019
Joker," Worthy Acting Performance By Phoenix Worth a Watch, but This Joker is Not Smart Enough to Become the Joker We've Come to Know
","Here, we have a broken man whose mental instability and illness is the catalyst for what Arthur Fleck eventually becomes, but I mean nowhere in this movie do we witness any kind of intellectual prowess, high intelligence, or even any miniscule reference to his wit and smarts to believe he has what it takes to become the Joker from the previous films.Also, there is merit to the theory that the whole entire movie was a dream playing out in his imagination, and he was conveying that to the psychiatrist the whole movie, which connects to the end since it starts with him meeting a psychiatrist and we know he was making things up by the revelations. In addition, there is no factuality to the idea that he was Thomas Wayne's lovechild. Joker is having a delusion of grandiose throughout the story, connecting himself to powerful people and situations, which would be a semi-trait of his narcissism, as well (although narcissism is far from his predominant psychological problems). I'd prefer this theory because it would explain why Fleck lacked any kind of pragmatism and intelligence we've come to expect throughout this movie.The Joker is playing the psychotherapist the whole time, making her feel sympathy and bad for him (as well as the audience), and that's the joke on her at the end, which enables him to kill her, too. This is Joker's own fantasy origin story, which has little validity.Go ahead and downvote, but there's no way this take on the Joker is intelligent and mentally competent enough to become Ledger's Joker.",6,488,847,7 October 2019
Parasite," Parasite: Is there Really a Such Thing in the Human Definition?
","When people think of a parasite, they obviously associate it with a lesser living creature living off of its larger, more prosperous host. For example, fleas live on dogs and consume their blood.According to society, which is constructed in a way that the most educated are burdened with defining the meaning of words, a parasite is a person who consumes resources off of another without returning anything. At least so it says, right?Well, what if an economic recession hits and people lose their jobs and no longer have a way of making the money they need to in order to repay whoever it is they are working for? What if they experience an illness, injury, or health problem (in addition to that bad economic situation) which deems them unable to even work productively (at least for a while)? What if the 'host' that the so-called 'parasite' human is borrowing resources from is actually a 'bad person' themselves who 'abuses' them both emotionally, verbally, and physically in order to boost their 'egos' to make themselves feel superior to the person they are 'helping'?....Is there actually a parasitic human, or are all people just human?Take for instance someone who is born into poverty, physically or mental abuse, or both. Are they parasites just because of this? Things they had no control over? Just because they are poor? What if this person decides to not make excuses and gets a job, but a recession hits that causes them to lose their job? Were they not a parasite before but now after they lose their job, which they cannot help, they are now?Perhaps most complexly, what if they people 'at the top' are actually the 'Parasites'? (if there was one). Isn't it true that government workers and 'politicians' live off of 'taxpayer money' (aka taxpayer labor)? Isn't it true that a mega-rich corporate leader consumes the labor of their subordinates in order to make exponentially more money off of them?Doesn't this luxurious CEO or executive 'suck the blood' and 'life' out of their workers by forcing them to work harder, work overtime, sometimes work 60 hours a week or more (with the threat they will be demoted or lose their jobs if they do not)? And isn't it true that due to increase production or productivity, the executive makes even more money on the backs of their employees? Furthermore, cannot the corporation hold onto the laborers' paychecks for at least 2 weeks in order to reinvest it in stocks before paying it out to those who earned it two weeks prior as they wait for their paychecks?Many years ago, a very startling and eye opening book came out which actually compared corporations to psychopaths. All of the traits in an empirical psychopath are parallel to exactly how corporations are run, and also how corporate executives operate: they callously mistreat their employees, can care less about their health or well being as long as they are greedily and selfishly getting wealthier and growing. As a corporation becomes bigger, the dichotomy between caring for a small group of employees and eventually becoming indifferent to any humanity and well being of the individuals (which also includes the customers) becomes starker in contrast. All that matters is personal selfish gain in an overabundance unnecessary amount of riches, as their employees struggle to pay their bills each pay period and have to wait two weeks often times for their checks. If they lay people off or if the corporation downsizes or relocates, then the employees are back to barely getting by with no check.So the question again must be asked: who 'really' is the Parasite? Either there are none, or everyone is.",8,5,10,13 February 2020
Hacksaw Ridge," One of the most inspirational movies of the decade and the best film of the year
","Not since Saving Private Ryan has a war movie balanced mainstream appeal with the realism, brutality, and gruesomeness of the battlefield. With Private Ryan, it was D-day and the landing of Normandy beach, France. With Hacksaw Ridge, it's the battle of the escarpment in Okinawa, Japan. Both were pivotal, defining battles towards the end of World War II. The final third of Hacksaw Ridge is pure hell and won't be for the faint of heart. But Mel Gibson knows this is war, and he did his research to make it as realistic as possible while still delivering fan service action scenes. A lofty score backs the action, pulling at the heart strings while these brave heroes sacrifice their lives for the freedom of their wives, children, and future children. Yes, it's a battle between good and evil, and a climactic scene toward the end powerfully juxtaposes the doctrine of the axis leading to suicide-by-sword of their commander with the hero's bible as the ally forces take command of the ridge. Beliefs here matter. This is a far contrast from the first half of the film, which shows the main character and hero, Desmond Doss' more innocent and peaceful upbringing and courtship of his future wife. Although Doss is raised in a relatively normal southern rural community as a 7th day Adventist, his religious faith, his dad is an alcoholic who struggles with his demons from serving in World War I. Hacksaw Ridge draws the line between heaven and hell, peace and war. In both, love is the glue that holds things together and wins battles. Love wins wars. Doss, according to his faith and convictions, chooses not to fight fire with fire, and in doing so, he may get wounded and burnt, but he manages to save his soul and about 75 of his fellow brothers and soldiers in one of the most brutal and unforgiving bloodbaths of the second world war. As a true real life hero, he is given the medal of honor, becoming the first conscientious objector to ever do so, by Harry S. Truman. This movie will move you to tears and will go down as one of the most inspirational and uplifting movies of the decade. While it has its moments of let downs here and there throughout the script (it wasn't written by Gibson, who does superb directing in it) which some people will criticize, many people will label it a masterpiece. It's such a great story to anyone open to receiving it. With strong faith and a good soul, one can be subjected to the depths (and heights) of hell, battle-scarred, bloodied, and broken, and still come out and return whole. Desmond Doss, a real life war hero who saved 75 wounded men without ever firing a gun or resorting to violence, did just that.",10,4,8,26 November 2016
