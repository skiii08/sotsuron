Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," A surprisingly entertaining romp of a movie
","This movie should have been awful. Battlefield Earth awful. I mean, seriously, who has that much of a twisted imagination or has dropped enough acid to come up with a story that makes Abraham Lincoln, one of the greatest Presidents in American history, into someone who hunts vampires? I don't know, because I don't make this stuff up, but this one sounds so off the wall that I had to check it out. And I'm glad I did, because that was one of the best uses of my chronic insomnia I've had in a while. Although the movie took itself seriously, it didn't take itself so seriously as to be unintentionally funny, and while the actors had to have known they weren't making Anthony And Cleopatra, they put themselves into their characters quite well. The visuals were very good, and the action sequences were convincing, if a bit far-fetched in places. All in all, I'm glad I watched it. Sure, it's not Lawrence Of Arabia, but it was never supposed to be; instead, Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is entertainment well done, and as such, it's an enjoyable watch.",8,2,3,5 November 2014
