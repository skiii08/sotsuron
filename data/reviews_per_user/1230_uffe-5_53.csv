The Blair Witch Project," Had to set another comment after reading some of the other comments.
","**Warning for spoilers** **Sorry for some spellingmisstakes** Let's put it this way. You people who don't like this movie has many reasons not to, but no one of them really is fair. I have read almost all comments and I keep seeing the same misstake in the ''bad'' comments: You don't seem to understand it. 1. Is it scary with a pile of rocks? Answer: YES, YES, YES! I bet if you heared some strange noise in the night, and wakes up to find a pile of rocks outside your tent, you would be scared as hell! 2. Heather annoying? Answer: NO, NO, NO! Isn't her reaction pretty realistic? I mean, let's face it: One of your best friends disappear without a trace (you ALSO hear him screaming in the night, but something is wrong, it isn't him) and someones teeths poppes up. Anyone, exept for Superman, would panic and, yes, scream.3. Throw up for the cameras? Answer: This was one of the stupid comments? What did you want them to do? Keep the camera straight, even though the circumstanses? I don't think so. Didn't you know before you saw TBWP, that the camera would be like this through the entire movie? Some other comments think that it's boring, probably just because that it is not like any other horrorfilm. They maybe want to see the actual creature, but HEY! That's the scary thing about a horrormovie isn't it? The unseen evil... You know that something is out there, but you never get to see it, or at least get a clear shot. That freaks, at least me, out. You guys probably wondered where the music were, or ''where did all the gore and effects go? isn't this a horrormovie''? Yes, it is. But it is a horrormovie that is very, very, very, very scary without anything of that in it. Only using a large forest, some voodostuff, and human minds and then making a masterpiece, is pure cinema art. And something we don't see every day.",Null,0,1,16 October 1999
Alien 3," Not very good.
","**Sorry for some spelling-misstakes** (Please read my reviews of ''Alien'' and ''Aliens'' too) This is the worst Alien-movie. Fincher tries to mix the dark feeling in the first movie with the 100 % action of ''Aliens''. I'm sorry Dave, it's simply doesn't work. OK, OK. I can admit it. It is entertaining at some points, but it is just because ''Alien 3'' is more of a copy of the other movies. Now, whats wrong with that picture? Everything is stolen from the other movies and you don't feel as amused of anything any more. The actors was really, really good but that can't save the bad script and the direction. I ( as a pure movielover ) will forever be gratefull for Fincher's job with ''Se7en''. This is though not one of his better movies.",Null,5,7,20 September 1999
Gremlins," Funny and cool mix of cute little pet and slimy, scary, but in some strange way charming monsters.
","The plot is well known. This is a cultmovie that should be seen. At first its warm, sweet and cuddly. Like a christmas-carol. Suddenty you are into a wild chaos with slimy monsters taking over a small town. The sequel never feeled as cool as this one. Critters go to bed... THE GREMLINS ARE TAKING OVER!!!!!!!!! By the way, where is Gremlins 3?????",Null,0,1,28 June 1999
Antz," Very funny, not direct ment for kids, movie!
",Very funny and entertaining. It's about the life for the ants. Simple isn't it? Hornestly I think that ''Antz'' has many disneys behind than in front in the list. The story is about how the ant-worker Z gets into trouble while kidnapping the ant-princess by mistake. After a while a great conspiracy among the ants appear. To be a kids movie ''Antz'' seems more serious and the characters voices sure mix perfect with themselves. Not to be missed by fans of the actors/esses! 4 out of 5,Null,0,0,1 January 2000
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Even better than the originals!!!!!!!!
","I never thought this was ever going to happen! Before I start I would recommend for those who have not seen this movie to skip this comment untill you see it. Then it's finally here. THE movie of all time. I'd sure like to see how Lucas could stand up with all the pressure. Those critics who rated down this movie probably did it with one reason. Not to be eaten up by all the hype around the movie. At first I didn't know what to think. ''Is this really what i've been waiting for''? Five minutes later I was all into it. I mean, what has Star Wars-fans to complain about? This is as good as it gets. Lucas has not added anything new, but lets be frank and honest about this, should he have? No, i really don't think so. This is was SW-fans been waiting for. The same feeling is there and the new effects are as stunning as the first films were back then. Williams music has never been this good. The eternal battle against good and evil. That is what Star Wars is all about! No-one ( specially not the fans ) need anything new. Anything out of the ordernal would be so un-Star Wars. Every character in this movie was geniously made and it really feels like it is alive. Although I must complain about the death of Darth Maul. It would be fun to see Qui-Gon Jin in Episode II, but he will probably appear there as some kind of ghost or something. But killing Darth Maul was not very smart. He was the key villain for gods sake! He hardley got to say anything before he got killed. Although the fight scene really was something! Darth Maul was so cool! Why couldn't he be in on Episode II. It would be better. Everybody did great and you could actually belive that Obi-Wan looked and acted like this as young. I even enjoyed Jar Jar Binks!!! One little miss only. When Qui Gon dies. Shouldn't Jedis disappear when they die? No complaints as a star wars-fan! Simpley the best movie of all time...for now. * * * * * out of * * * * *",Null,0,1,21 August 1999
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Not to be forgotten...
","**Some spelling mistakes**The first Indy-movie is a perfect adventuremovie. Just look at the opening scene! Indiana Jones is, together with Han Solo, his best role. It's great to see him at his best! The enviroments in this movie is from all around the world, and creates the most thrilling safari-feeling ever in a movie (except for some jungle-movies like PREDATOR or JURASSIC PARK). The best thing about the movie is the main score. John Williams is definitly a genius when it comes down to this. All the lines are also fabolus (''Why does it have to be snakes??!!!'', ''Adios Stupido''). This movie is exciting and entertaining, just like the sequels, even though this is miles ahead from them.Rating: 8.5/10",Null,0,0,15 March 2000
Casablanca," Has got it all
","Play it again sam! That is exactly what you can do with this movie. It never really gets bad. Not many movies are that way. Best female performance in my top 10 list ( right before Alexandra Dahlstrom in '' Fucking Åmål '' aka '' Show me love'') !!! Its a total experience and I know that young people will hate it and throw up comments like: I did'nt like it. It was in black & white!!! or This is sooo boring... But hey! Im 13 years old here!!!!

Casablanca," How great can a movie get?
","Maltin sure knew what he was talking about when he said that everything was right with this movie. This must be THE classic in movie making. It doesn't matter how high 'The Godfather' climbs on the film-lists all over the world, how shocking 'Psycho' is, or how many fans 'Star Wars' might have. CASABLANCA will still be the one movie for movielovers. I'm not saying that it's better than all these, but it is the most memorable movie.
Let's go through all the factories:First of all: The scene. You soon get the feeling that Rick's bar is your new favorite place, your second home even if it's just a movie. The score follows the movies perfectly. Acting is obvious. Who'll ever forget Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in the leading roles? Paul Henreid, Claude Rains and Conrad Veidt also very good, and memorable in the side-roles. You don't want this movie to end, but what an ending it is! I really hope everyone can agree that the finale is at least one of the three best scenes ever (''Here's lookin' at you, kid'').Dooley Wilson does ''As time goes by'' as noone else. See this movie more than once, and then... Play it again, Sam!Don't miss for the world!: 10/10",10,0,0,15 March 2000
Se7en," One of the best movies ever created.
","My expectation of Se7en wasn't that big. Maybe that's why i loved it that much. The actors are fantastic, the plot scary, and both the music and directing tops the best X- files episode. This one even gets on top of ''The silence of the lambs'' ( even though the copying from that movie is pretty obvious ). It got me in about the same way as Texas Chainsaw Massacre. It was dark and disgusting. I mean, just the idea of getting a big fat man eat himself to death makes anyone land on your knees and throw up. The city is as dark and rainy as in ''Blade Runner'' and ''The Crow'', the plot at least as good as in Silence of the lambs, and none of the actors have made a better performance than they did in this movie. The best of them was of course Kevin Spacey. This movie is going up to number 4 on my favorite movie-list. I don't think i can describe it any further. Go and watch Se7en now. If you dare that is.",9,0,0,20 April 1999
Alien: Resurrection," Not t h a t bad
","I can't really say I was expecting something great when Alien 3 sucked so bad it went out of saliva, and that the series just got worse for every sequel ( don't get me wrong, i liked ''Aliens'' but it couldn't at all match the original ). But it wasn't that bad at all. It was actually better than Alien 3. Winona Ryder has nothing to do in an Alien movie, but she's doing OK. Weaver does not look like Ripley anymore. Where did  that fighter filled with pain go? The claustrofobia is wiped out and no kind of Alien feeling is left to count on. Even though I must say I kinda liked this movie. 3 out of 5.",Null,0,0,20 September 1999
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Hilarious and very entertaining.
","When I first saw this movie I thought it was so great, that I just wrote a very simple comment. Here I am to leave my point of view.
Right now ''South Park - Bigger, longer and uncut'', is nr.27 of my favorite movies (I have really listed them all) and I must say that this is a comedy-masterpiece. From the start to finish this movie grabs you, and the usual South Park-stuff mixed with a really reasonable plot. Well, as reasonable as it could be. The way Parker & Stone has built the story up like a Brodway-musical, is genius. The songs, from ''Quiet mountain town'' to the final, through ''I can change'', ''Brian Boitano'' and ''I'm Super (thanks for asking)'', are fantastic. This movie was actually the movie that made me interested in musicals of any kind. I guess the plot is known, and is nothing I should grab, but even the smallest and weakest jokes gets fun. The even better thing is that the movie is taking about everything from the TV-series without even feeling something like a repeating, like ''The Flintstones'' for example. Any fans, should have seen it already, but you don't have to be any kind of South Park to like this movie. In fact, where I live, you only have to be 7 years to see it! REAL scandal!
But I still recommend this movie for anyone who can apriciate cartoon blood and violence, sarcasm (plus entertaining song) and still finding it fun.

Batman Returns," Cool...
","The Batman-movie from 1989 is still one of my semi-favorites. This movie might not be as entertaining, but lets face it. It is one hell of a cool movie. Michelle Pfieffer and Danny DeVito are extremely hilarious as the title-baddies. Keaton is as usual a  great Batman, and if that wasn't enough, Christopher Walken is swung in to it all! ''Batman Returns'' brings back some memories about that old 60-series, thinking about the evil Penguin and Catwoman. They are still a bit silly today, my theory, on purpice. Even though the nightmare-background (The Penguin is a freak that has lived in the sewers, since his parents dumped him there) you don't really think about it that much.''Batman Returns'' is in many ways different from the 1989-movie. Well, the comic-action is still around, but the concept has been refreshed in a way I like.Even though the movie itself is quite good, It wouldn't have been the same without Keaton, Pfieffer, DeVito Walken and the great witts.
Thrilling and cool. Rating: 7/10",Null,0,0,1 March 2000
The Terminator," Classic movie, even though the sequel was better.
","''The Terminator'' is a masterpiece. It might not be very much of a ''cinema art'' experience but it sure is entertaining. The actors are perfect ( who can say Schwarzenegger isn't doing a bad job here ) and Cameron gets a great start as a director. Cameron did many good movies later on ( ''Aliens'' and ''Titanic'' of course included ), but his greatest work ever has got to be ''Terminator 2''. It's a lot better, but to be on the safe side, watch this movie first. 4 out of 5.",Null,0,0,25 September 1999
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," YOU CAN'T FIGHT IN HERE! THIS IS THE WAR ROOM!
","This is Stanley Kubrick at his best. When I first saw ''DR. STRANGELOVE'' I laughed a bit. The day after I saw it again, and suddenly it all became clear to me, and now I must say that this is his best movie, together with the incredible A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Just Dr. Strangelove himself is a classic. Sellers is hands down incredible in the three parts he play and without the black & White coloring it wouldn't be the same. This is an average perfect movie. You shouldn't edit it, or add more to it. How I love this holy movie!

Alien," Best of the Alien-movies and ( together with 2001 ) the best sci-fi movie ever made
","**Sorry for some spelling-misstakes**
I must say that this movie is SO, SO great! The script is genious. First building it up slowly, and carefully, nothing really happens it is only a great fog and a mystic feeling lies over everything. Then one person gets injured and the caos starts spreading. Slowly, the crisis gets more and more a fact until there is only one person on the ship left. NO OTHER MOVIE has had this great combination before. It just takes my breath away. None of the other movies had this magic in it. Sure, ''Aliens'' was really great, but it was more of an non-stop actionmovie, ''Alien 3'' was the boring part, and ''Alien Ressurection'' was a bit better, and way more entertaining. But to put it in another way. Many people who loved the three sequels of the movie might just get really dissapointed. This is not at all like the other movies. But if you can accept this kind of slow movies you will love it! 9.5 out of 10!!!!!!",Null,0,1,20 September 1999
Armageddon," A boring movie is closer than you think...
","''Armageddon'' is a stupid and boring movie. The first half is ok and entertaining for fun. But the rest of the movie made me sleep. The same things happened over and over again and it was just so unrealistic and stupid. The story is stupid, some of the dialoges are embarrassing and when the movie is over, all you can think of is the main question: Why bring a mini-gun to space? What, are they afraid of evil moon-people at NASA or what? The plot is silly, and the way everybody brags, ''These are the best oil drillers in the world'', is even more silly. The start, and fine acting raises the grade but it still doesn't worth more than 2 out of 5.",Null,0,1,21 January 2000
Armageddon," Why bring a Mini-gun to outer space?
",I had real good expectations when i sat down at the cinema. I mean after all this is a Jerry Bruckheimer production. BUT.... OK OK OK I can agree that it's an OK movie as long as the characters are keeping their feet on the ground. But it just gets boring in the space-part of the movie. The moment the ''super cool drillers'' gets away from the earth everything that possibly could go wrong GOES WRONG ( i mean if you are going to save the planet the space-craft should be 100% safe )! Sure it has some good actors ( Steve Buscemi rules! ) but Armageddon is still boring and way too long. All that seems to matter to the makers of this movie is the thrilling special-effects. And by the way....why bring a Mini-gun to outer space?????,Null,0,1,19 April 1999
The Shining," Another classic movie from Kubrick.
","Stanley Kubrick can do the topmovies in everything! A cinematic masterpiece in space traveling, a historical epic, men falling in love with young girls, black & white comedies about war, another big epic, two glorious war-movies, an extremely strong hooligan-movie. He even managed to put together two Hollywood-couples as a couple in a crashed marriage, and with the heart pounding super-scary 'THE SHINING' he proves that he even can do 80's horrormovies like no one else. The decoration is scary. Long hallways, room 327, old ladies, spooky bartenders and two extremly chilling twin sisters. Ordinary doors has never seemed this scary before. The music IS one of the best things in the movie and you sure hear it when Wendy finds out what Jack has been writing all this time. THE SHINING is both very entertaining and highly thrilling. A perfect movie for a cold winter midnight. I hope no one will forget the acting? Scatman Crothers, fits like a glove, Danny Lloyd maybe the best child actor yet, Shelly Duvall, it's hard to believe that she is acting, and finally (tamtamtammmm) JACK NICHOLSON! This is together with BATMAN his absolute nr.1 performance.

So many complaining people! What's in your brains?! I mean just look. T2:s got it all.

And the most important part: Extremely well made actionscenes. An example is just when the little girl listen to 'over the rainbow' while the killing is on max. The cinematic experience is cool. It's the same thing Kubrick did in A CLOCKWORK ORANGE. Mixing classic music with intense violence.

Here we are talking action not thriller. The acting is more of the fun kind, while it was a bit more serious in the first one. This is though the second best Alien-movie. The thought of an army of Aliens chocked the most of us back in 86 after experiencing ''Alien''. At first the feeling is a bit like the original movie. But soon you will find out that that is not the case. This is one of the most entertaining movies I have ever seen in my entire life. The special effects are really cool and Cameron really makes it go fast. The tempo is fast just as ''Terminator'' and ''T2''.

While doing three years in prison, his thoughts are changed and he comes home to find his younger brother (Furlong) seeing Norton's older self as an idol.

Die Hard 2," Pure entertainment.
","**Factual spelling mistakes**
Renny Harlin does great action but, usually, he's not doing the best dilalogue-scenes. I was happy to admit that that standard also includes ''Die Hard 2''. The L.A cop John McClane is looking forward to spending the christmas holiday with his beloved wife Holly. The biggest problem seems to be the ticket on mrs.McClane's mother's car. But the problems will surely increase. In the middle of all the christmas-stress a well known dicator is going to land, to be taken care of by the USA. But, of course, a bunch of very evil terrorists has decided to disturb that holiday peace buy taking over the entire airport-control tower. They want the dictator and if someone disobeys they will crash a plane. For John McClane starts an adventure to stop the rat pack from killing innocent, including his wife (again) and starting of a new war. The sequel to John McTiernan's ''Die Hard'' is a highly entertaining movie, sometimes exciting but far from realistic. Everything is the same from the first movie, just doubled. The movie is twice as voilent, the bad guy is twice as evil (but too stoneface), the explosions are more and greater and the speed is even faster. Willis is as usual perfect in the title role and Renny Harlin is doing what he does best. This sequel has that originality that the first one had, but it is still one of my favorite actionmovies. My rating: 8/10",8,1,3,8 February 2000
Die Hard 2," One of the best sequels ever made!
",So John McClane is back. That it is one in a billion that he would actually fall in the same trap again exactly one year later is nothing we will argue about. Renny Harlin does it ALMOOOOOST as good as John McTiernan did it. And as usual a sequel of an explosive action movie got to have more violence and even more action. And Die Hard 2 is surely nothing out of the ordinary. But it has got what mostly action movies don't. A plot. A REAL plot. The story is the same but the building has been changed into an airport. And the movie is for once in a while better than the book. The bad guy in this movie is twice ( if not three double ) as cold and tough as Hans Gruber ever tried to be. But since his face is cuind of a ''stoneface'' he doesn't express the same fun as Rickman. The two planes explosions are two of the most classic in action history. Bruce Willis doesn't play as good as in Die Hard part one but he is so awesome as he could be. As usual the movie is filled with stupid cops and some buddies. And part two in this trilogy is what Die Hard almost was. Non Stop Action. Although the fightscene at the wing of the bad guys plane is very very very un-realistic it goes to watch. Said and done.For thoes who thought Die Hard was the best movie ever will be demolished by disappointment. But those who liked Die Hard but thought it was too tame (or those who have never ever seen Die Hard) will love Die Hard 2. Yippie-Kay-Yeah everybody!!!!!!,8,0,2,4 April 1999
Saving Private Ryan," '' Great gore '' ?????? Show some respect huh? This happened for real!
","I'm getting really tired of some people. Some guys seems to expect entertaining violence in the '' Lethal Weapon '' - way in movies like '' Clockwork Orange '', '' Reservoir Dogs '', and this one. These people, seems to think that when a soldier in this movie picks up an arm that seems to be his own, they should say: '' Hey, that was cool ''. Wrong, wrong, wrong. The meaning of this movie is to make you shocked. In movies that Stallone, Willis, Van Damme, or Schwarzenegger stars in you don't feel shocked at all. if you don't get shocked of this movie then you are extremely stupid. Now for the movie itself. This is one of the best movies ever created and for sure the best war - movie of all times. The cast are spectacular, the realizm shocking ( as it should be ), and the battle scenes incredible exiting. This movie is a top movie. 10 stars.

Saving Private Ryan," Indeed memorable
","Steven Spielberg is back in buissnes again. It has been five years (at the release) with SCHINDLER'S LIST 1993, but now he strikes back better than Darth Vader's empire (who fell in JEDI anyhow). SAVING PRIVATE RYAN might not be anything out of the ordenary (the first scene is of course an exception) but it appeals to me in a strange way. The opening D-day scene is a classic piece of art.Tom Hanks (of course mr.GoodGuy) is an officer, leading Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, among others to find a private Ryan (Matt Damon) wich three brothers has been killed. However you can trust the thin red line that is the plot of the mission is something to discuss, but it doesn't make the movie any worse.The realism is shocking, and the warscenes are just as intense as exciting.

The Evil Dead," I loved it!
","Where I come from, ''The Evil Dead'' is hard to find. So, it was clever luck that I happened to see the uncut version with a friend at my place. You can say what you want about cinema-art but I really liked this movie. It was so simple made, but it got so exciting and entertaining. The cheap (no offense Sam, this is a minimum-budget movie) special effects are a tribute, cause the better the effects in a horrormovie are, the worse the movie itself get. **Minor spoiler** In the end of the movie, when the dawn raises you feel calmed, since Bruce is safe now when the sun is up. That is why you get even more horrofied when something runs up at him from behind. **End of spoiler, keep reading** The movie is very caotic, but realistic enough to think that it is scary.

I wasn't surprised a bit, since I knew I understood it, and I knew that it was movie making at it's purest form. Stanley Kubrick is my favorite director and this movie is one of the main reasons. Because, let's face it, there isn't a film that's quite like 2001. Not in the sci-fi genre or anywhere else. When I sit down to watch this movie, I never try to understand it or take it that serious. I just let it pass. I'll just let it go on, and I see the movie just because the pleasure of it. The pleasure of seeing something that beats everyone else, when it comes to being original.

Toy Story 2," The best animated film ever
","**Warning for minor spoilers and spelling mistakes**I didn't really liked the first Toy Story-movie. Everybody said that it was great, but I thought (and I still do today) that the movie missed a spirit. It was only a show. A wide production of breathtaking animations. And, sure, the animation was impressive, but we have to review movies for what they are, right?Therefore, the sequel surprised me like no other movie.Toy Story 2 mixes some usual children's humour, most of it in the beginning, and ''real'' laughs, making it charming and entertaining like no other movie. At least not for kids.The story seems simple, but still gets quite genious. People should not avoid this film, just because the animation. Lately, the animated movie has grown, to more adult-fitting. Not much, Toy Story 2 for example is not really an adult movie, but still some ingredients in ''Prince of Egypt'' and ''Antz''. Toy Story 2 is a movie for all ages. Really!The characters are entertaining and no one is annoying. Some of the highlights (they are many) is definitely the encounter with Buzz Lightyear and another Buzz-action hero who really think he is a space hero, the car stop at the Barbie-section and the great ending scene at the airport. Like other sequels to movies like ''Home Alone'' and ''Austin Powers'' this sequel is not a remake of the original, where all the jokes has been easily uppdated and refreshed. Every lack the first movie had has been smoothely fixed up and the movie has a heart, wich, in my opinion, the original missed.The adventure in the movie is a whole lot more entertaining than before, and it is a whole lot funnier than ''Toy Story''. Both the opening scene, the incounter with Woody and his round up-gang and the rescue-patrol is highly enjoyable. Quite a little masterpiece.My rating: 9/10",9,0,1,22 February 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Definitely Kubrick's best movie.
","This movie is amazing. One of the best movies I have ever seen.Violent, gross, strong, powerful, and the most uncomfortable movie in the world. McDowall as the Beethoven-loving hooligan-leader is perfect and disgusting, when he and his pack of 'droogs' is going around and rape, kills and as he says commiting 'ultra-violence'. His mates sets him up, he gets brainwashed and is thrown back in the society as a new person. But is he? And how does the world treat him nowadays?This movie is VERY disturbing. It's so tragic and powerful.Just the feeling you get when the droogs rings the bell on mr.Alexander's door. You don't feel safe in your house anymore. I don't think I could sleep for a week after seeing this movie. Actually, I kind of hide it. I have seen it two times, maybe three, no more. The main reason is... I don't dare. It isn't just a movie you slack upon a Sunday morning. Just as in other Kubrick movies you will have to be ready for something different. 2001 (you can't say I'm wrong), DR. STRANGELOVE (verrryyy bizarre), Barry Lyndon (is there a longer movie?), The Shining (it IS scary!!!) and Full Metal Jacket (about the same as this one). I haven't seen EYES WIDE SHUT yet, but I will be prepared.I love Stanley Kubrick, he is my nr.1-director (even though he's dead) and A CLOCKWORK ORANGE is his best movie ever made.The scariest movie in the world. 10/10",Null,1,2,31 March 2000
Reservoir Dogs," Perfect movie. One of the greatest.
","Even though 'Pulp Fiction' is quite better, 'Reservoir Dogs' tops most movies. Although the acting is so chemical, under it you can see that the team really enjoys to working together. Their teamwork is the main attraction to the movie. But, good acting is not really a savior. The directing, debuting Tarantino, and script, also QT, is what people will refer to as 'the old fashion Tarantino-style'. The movie is soaked up with blood. It is horrible, as in explicit content, but still, in a way cool and quite funny (if you can look closer?).This is simply a gangster movie that is out of the ordernal. 'Reservoir Dogs' doesn't get predictable, from the fact that the story has been rollercoastered around and the scenes are all in a great mess. But that is also a main attraction. I love this movie, because it has got a hidden meaning deep under the very intensive pulse of this gangster-classic.Harvey Keitel and co starring Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Quentin Tarantino and Edward Bunker as the gangsters they would stick up on (nah, not really, but, kind of) are fantastic titles and brings this cult-movie up even higher, as I've said.The absolutely gross torture-scene (Michael Madsen, Kirk Baltz) should nobody miss. It's a classic.Rating: 9/10",Null,2,5,10 March 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," The final chapter...
","Stanley Kubrick's final hours of movie making, is here I'm afraid. And when the ending credits roll for the last time signed Stanley Kubrick, you feel abandoned from magical moments in your life. EYES WIDE SHUT shines Kubrick. All the way through you feel that this is his work. This has also got all the usual things from the loved director. The script is as usual a little bid odd, there are at least a couple of controversial scenes, it's long, and the ending is perfectly surprisingly.The set and score are notable. The acting is great, and different when you know that Cruise and Kidman really are married. Also a number of different side-figures. Even though the long running time, the movie never bores, the desperation of Tom Cruise is something I'll always remember.
Compared to the old classics, EYES WIDE SHUT is not quite as amazing, but it's still a very good movie, signed perfection, that is Stanley Kubrick, another very worthy part in the line of movies Kubrick has made.8/10",Null,0,0,1 April 2000

Die Hard," Classic action movie.
","''Die Hard'' is the one movie wich gave meaning to following movies like ''Speed'', ''Passenger 57'', ''Air Force One''. Yeah, trapped heroes.A tired L.A cop, John McClane, is visiting his wife at a christmas party in the huge Nakatomi-building where she works. They have a certant complicated past (she uses her real name Gennaro), but this will be the twist in their relationship. Meanwhile german terrorists led by mr.Evil, super bad guy Hans Gruber (Alan Rickman) is planning to take over the building for reasons unknown (so far in the story). After some introductions and an argue that McClane finds quite simular to other memories from the past, the terrorists takes the building over and holds a number of people as hostage. McClane realizes that one of the hostages is his wife, so he hides in the building (without any socks or shoes) to fight the bad guys. After a while the policeman Al Powell and a number of others police forces, including the F.B.I, gets involved from the outside. Sgt. Powell creates intimate relations with John McClane on a radio while all the other policemen seem to be nothing but idiots.John McTiernan directed ''Die Hard'' in 1988 and it became a hit that bombed all over the world. This is the breakthrough of Bruce Willis, the tragedy is that he had to get stuck with the role until now (''The Sixth Sense''). The movie is rapid, packed with explosions, very violent and still quite charming. John McClane is the cool guy who responses to Hans just as clever and cocky as any rebellian teenager to a teacher. Best of them all is Alan Rickman as Hans. He is one of the best actors in the world, even though I have seen way too little of his work, but of what I've seen it is superb. Seeing him in an actionmovie might seem strange for some, but for those who grew up with this movie we'll never stop reacting to ''Die Hard'' when we see him.I will never forget the first time I watched ''Die Hard''. When the movie was over, I could'nt move. I was stunned, and through the entire day I WAS John McClane shooting terrorists in a sky scraper. ''Die Hard'' is to date one of my favorite movies. Except from ''Lethal Weapon'' this is probably the best action adventure to get. This is simply the obvious action classic.9/10",9,0,0,8 February 2000
Die Hard," It's gonna take a heck of an action movie to beat Die Hard!
","When i first saw Die Hard....it's one of the many classic moments of my life. Alan Rickman probably the best bad guy ever since ''Hannibal the Caniball''. And Bruce Willis!!!!! This movie is one of the few that really knocked me off my feet. I can't describe the first Die Hard moment in my life but i will try. When it came i wasn't interested of it. But as time passed Bruce Willis came up in a lot of blockbusters and i started to like him. When i looked up his first film it was Blind Date. I had seen it bud i didn't like it very much. But his breakthrough was Die Hard. I held the video in my hand and i was thrilled of expectations. All i've heard about it. I suddently got nervous when i realised that everything but the best action movie ever would be a disappointment. And when i turned off the lights and pressed PLAY i could almost fade out. After i saw the plane-scene ( ''Fist with your toes''-classic line ) i started to realise what it was about. And when i one hour later saw Bruce Willis run around with a machine-gun i was convinced. When the credits where gone i couldn't move. What a movie! When i took control over my self i WAS John McClane with a machine gun in my hands. And it was I who kicked Karls ass, and shot Hans in the head. After that I was the one who saved MY wife and hugged Al Powell. Then I drew away in Argyles Limo. Never ever before i had been so in love with a movie. It was just spectacular. And some of the lines i saw in that movie i still use myself. And for you guys who don't have Die Hard in your movie-shelf. GET IT IN THERE! In one way or another. Coz for you action fans out there. It's an adventure you will never ever forget.",9,0,0,4 April 1999
Psycho," One of the best movies ever made!
","**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!10 out of 10 OF COURSE!!!!!!!!",10,15,28,24 October 1999
Scream 2," Who said sequels suck?
",Scream 2 is a fantastic movie. An overdose of horror and fun stuff.But if you wanted something that would beat Scream 1...BEAT IT! In Scream you just enjoyed. In Scream 2.... Although this is probably the only horror movie that you shouldn't watch alone. Not because it's scary or anything. I had a movienight with two pals. We watched Scream 2 and it was just spectacular. Through the whole movie we couldn't stop talking about who the killer was. Until another murder was in action of course. OK to make a long thing short: If you liked Scream and want Scream 2 to be something special.... IN YOUR DREAMS PAL! But if you don't have so much expectations or haven't even seen Scream you will enjoy this movie reeeeaaaal good!!!,Null,0,0,7 April 1999
Scream 2," Fantastic sequel!
","**Includes spoilers from Scream 1**I remember that I missed ''Scream 2'' when it was on the cinema, cause I thought that the first scream-movie was overrated and bad (after seeing it again I must say it is one of my best ever) so me and my friend who both are huge scream-fanatics rented this movie over a night, both very excited about this new sequel. Most of the time went to figure out who the killer was, and that was incredibly fun to speculate about.The story is about the same as before. A new killer is stalking new victims, well awere of the rules of sequels. Here we have some new butcher-victims to ''slice and dice'' and Craven really follows those sequel-rules. The biggest different between S2 and its original is the amount of blood. This is what you can call a ''blood-show'' where the victims are lined up to get knives stucked up here and there. In the first movie I figured out pretty soon who the killers were (or it was at least my theory all the way out), but here it was so many people to choose from and that made it fun! It is ''Cluedo'' all the way, but when the killer (or killers, maybe killress) got revealed it was a slightly bad pick. Otherwise ''Scream 2'' hits bullseye and for you who liked the first screammovie will NOT be dissapointed on the sequel.4/5",Null,0,0,2 January 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," A heck of an action movie. But can never be as good as the two earlier blowing hits.
","YIPPIE KAY YEAH! John McClane is back for the third time. And i thought Die Hard 2 was explosive! PUUUH Die Hard 3 is ( if possible ) even more explosive. But that doesn't make a good movie. Because even if Bruce Willis is as good as usual, Samuel L Jackson is terrific, and Jeremy Irons is as good as Alan Rickman was Die Hard 3 is the worst of the three. But don't be scared. Die Hard 3 is a terrific action movie. The fall in this movie is in a few things. One of them is the script. The scripts in the last two movies were SO cool. I mean just the idea of trapping an action hero into a building is genius. And the supersonic snowstorm in nr.2 was so spectacular.  But even if the third part in the series doesn't get up to the first and secound it still is a great action movie.",7,0,0,4 April 1999
Con Air," Got what it takes for a summer hit-blockbuster!
",So Jerry Bruckheimer has done it again. For those who didn't know Con Air is a sequel of The Rock. Although Con Air is a better movie in all ways. It's loaded with expected fireworks and glorius actors. And inbetween some fun-lines in the breath of Beverly Hills cop. But to make a REAL good action-movie you must ( believe it or not) have some kind of plot. It can't be the same things all the time without something new explores. Although real action fans will love Con Air. Without a doubt.,Null,0,0,4 April 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Sticks around in your mind a lifetime.
","It's not the easiest thing in the world to describe with words how perfect THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION really is. Well, let's try. It won't take long, read other comments for closer details and views. This is a fantastic unforgettable movie where a banker (Robbins) gets his life changed, when he get a double life-sentence because of the murder of his wife and her lover. The first years gets to be a pure hell, he gets harassed, and he doesn't fit in. When he meet Freeman and his pals and starts a friendly relationship the movie starts up.

Scream," I mean, its so BIG!
","**Small spoilers below, small but they who have not seen the movie should still keep away for best result in the movie****Also includes spelling mistakes, that I know about but I don't have enough energy left to fixe it up**''Scream'' is huge! 'Scream' super-blockbuster! 'Scream 2' naturaly mega-blockbuster! 'Scream 3' will probably be even bigger. Those who love horror (or all related genres) films have so much to thank this movie. ''Scream'' kicked up horrorfilms from the grave. Sure we've seen some real crap, but at the same time some greatness (''The Faculty'', ''The Blair Witch Project'' (I know, its not the same, but really, do you think anyone ever done it if 'Scream' never came`?)). The movie itself then. This movie is my third favorite movie of all time. Its so entertaining and funny. Except for the opening scene you can't buy any mean say that its scary anywhere, can you?
Craven and Williamson has cooked up a standard slasher-film where teens get sliced up by a maniac. But now the teens are prepeared (from all movies of course). The thing that makes ''Scream'' so different from the rest is that we find out about all details, compairs, and rules of scary movie, who we all know existed but never thought about. And if that wasn't enough it is funny! Craven and Williamson makes, among much else, fun about how long the killer can survive (how many can survive two runthroughs in the heart by an umbrella?) and just look at the school-cleaner, Fred. Take a look at his clothes too. Buy the way, he is played by Craven! The acting is very funny (I just loved the super-stupid Dewey), the music is standard-good, but the soundtrack is great (I have it myself).Of course these slashers can't be really called as horrorfilm, so I can say that this is the best slasherfilm ever!10/10",Null,0,0,2 January 2000

","**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes** (no spoilers=))''The Matrix'' is not really what I've expected. Even though some brilliant special effects, it was only towards the end of the movie that it got exciting. The Wachowski-brothers has made a really wellmade movie, but hornestly, John Woo does it better. Everything was better in ''Face/Off'' for example. Keanu Reeves is not one of the best actors in the world, and this movie really tries to confuse us in a way that Terry Gilliam tried in ''Twelve Monkeys'' but it still ends up like an ordinary ''Bye Bye-Brain'' action movie. Only better made. If the brothers just made a more entertaining script, this would be really good!

Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," It's easy to say. It's more difficult to explane: The best movie ever made
","STAR WARS and THE GODFATHER is the god of movies. 
This movie didn't really turn me into a super duper star wars fan. But  I sure must admit that ''Star Wars'', ''The Empire Strikes Back'', and ''Return Of The Jedi'' ( or in another way the ''Star Wars Trilogy'' ) is by far the greatest movie(s) ever created. George Lucas rocks! The actors where good, the effects was ( in the 70:s ) incredible, and the directing very good. It's an adventure beyond everything else. And the other 2 movies were at least as perfect. In the ''first'' Star Wars-movie princess Leia is captured by the evil Space Empire, lead by the even more evil Darth Vader, from their gigantic space station, The Death Star. The rescuers are Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo, C-3PO, R2-D2 and Chewie, but let's not bore you. We all know that.
The best thing about this movie is that it combines so many kinds of genres. Star Wars is filled with action, adventure and absolutly fantastic space scenes. But in the same time the movie is human, sad and the romance is not as flat as in all the 80's action movies. The movie is also a saga. The farmerboy finds the eremite, they take help from the raw cowboy and his sidekicks, and the mission is to rescue a princess. That message was strongest in Episode IV. It is a classic battle between good and evil. And not in a Evil Dead-way nor in a Exorcist-way. It is the Star Wars-way. The best example of the longtime battle. Once again, I can't say that I'm a Star Wars-freak, but this is the greatest movie.",Null,0,0,23 February 2000

At some points it is more of a direct remake of the first movie, but mostly it is new profiles and new stories to experience. I thought the rescuing of an innocent princess was magic. Boy! Here (for those who did not knew) Luke gets to the ''Dagobah-system'' to find the Jedi-master Yoda, Obi Wan's master. There he will learn to suffer hard training, and wild adventures until he finnaly meets the master of darkness, Darth Vader. In the same leap goes Han Solo's adventure in Lando Calrissian's city in the clouds, together with Chewie, Leia, C3PO and R2-D2.
