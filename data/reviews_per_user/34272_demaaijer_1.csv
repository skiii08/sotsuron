50 First Dates," A heartwarming movie
","This is one of the few Adam Sandler movies I wish to recommend everyone to see as a must watch movie. As with all his movies you will see characters from the Saturday Night Live crew who are still close friends after he quit the TV show, and add a little humor to tickle your funny bone. Memory loss is a medical issue that still plague millions of people worldwide after vehicle accidents, which could have been prevented. Unfortunately the prevention issue has not been addressed in this movie, but the after accident solution that this movie successfully portrays has been applied successfully by too few therapists around the world. Hopefully this movie will change that. The soundtrack is another beautiful addition that I also recommend that you purchase along with the DVD to entertain friends and family at home during thanksgiving, Xmas, and other social group gatherings.",Null,0,0,17 May 2006
