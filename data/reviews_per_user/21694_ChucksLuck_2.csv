Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Bad, really bad
","I loved the first Pirates, the 2nd was OK, third was bearable, the forth is just bad, bad, bad. Penelope Cruz was awful in it, so much so I missed Kiera Knightly who I can't stand at the best of times. I've given it a three just because I love Jack Sparrow's character and liked him in this, I think Johnny Depp plays him brilliantly but did show an element of boredom in Pirates 4. The energy just wasn't there. There's no plot really, certainly not an interesting one. It's two hours of one sword fight after another. The acting is ridiculous. It's a waste of time. I'm just happy I didn't pay to see it.",3,2,3,7 October 2011
Bridesmaids," 3 of the 4 points are for Melissa McCarthy
","I'm so, so disappointed. I wasn't that fussed about watching this but all my friends said it was hilarious, so many great reviews etc that in the end I couldn't wait to see it and was really looking forward to it. After renting it on iTunes at the bargain price of Â£3.49(!), I settled down expecting to enjoy a humorous couple of hours. This didn't happen and I feel cheated. I've given the film 4/10, three of these points are for Melissa McCarthy who plays Megan and provides all of the decent comedy moments and is possibly the only likable character in the entire film. The thing with films like this is that you need to like the characters, you need to want to see the downtrodden, unlucky in life and love underdog get their day in the sun and the happy ending. Unfortunately, Annie (Kristen Wiig) was such a bitter, twisted, jealous, vindictive cow that I was hoping more that she'd get hit by a truck. I didn't want to see her get a happy ending, she didn't deserve one. She was vile. I'd usually be laughing my head off in a scene like the one at the bridal shower but because the tone of the film is so nasty (struggling to find a better word but that's just what it is) I was completely stone faced. I didn't find the bathroom scenes offensive but I don't think they worked well at all and again, failed to make me laugh - I think it was a poor attempt to get a giggle and, again, where I'd be laughing in another film, this just didn't work. The writing is pretty bad, the dialogue is rubbish. Looks like a lot is improvised which can be brilliant with some actors, not with these. It just drew out an already boring scene and made me realise how damn irritating Kristen Wiig is.Just a shoddy, hackneyed, poor film. Don't believe the hype!",9,5,10,12 March 2012
