Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," star wars I: the phantom acting
","The spoiler for my _comment_ is that you probably won't read anything in it you've not read in the myriad of other comments on this film ...... with the possible exception that I for one don't think the other installments of _Star Wars_, e.g. the 70s-80s ones, were all that. If that offends you beyond belief, you should probably stop reading right now.In 1977 I was 16 years old and had been reading science fiction for years. I'd heard about _Star Wars_ and had read all the criticisms coming from the 'real science fiction' camp (simplistic plot/philosophy, spectacular but physically impossible -- that is, impossible via the laws of physics -- effects, etc etc etc), so I knew what to expect. I went, turned off my brain and had fun.HOWEVER. Even at that time I did not think I was seeing something 'great.' A lot of people use the word 'epic' to describe these movies and I think that is stretching it - I use the word 'epic' to refer to things that have considerably more, well, _gravitas_ than these large, expensive, moving comic books (don't get me wrong, I love comic books).And so, with that out of the way ... I guess my confusion is not so much about what Lucas has 'lost' or 'forgotten' as about what he ever had to begin with. For example, I agree that Jar Jar is intensely annoying, but I found C3PO annoying, too, in a kind of 'less nefarious Dr. Smith' kind of way.I'd say the big problem with this film is that it is completely unfocused: unfocused story, unfocused acting (good lord, the acting), unfocused visuals): it just keeps throwing brightly colored, ill-thought-out stuff at you and expecting _that alone_ to keep you entertained. Several fine actors are completely and utterly wasted. Most 'epics' have at least one character you can follow and care about - do we really care about any of these people? My own answer is no, and the reason I do not care is that I have no idea what makes any of them tick, what drives any of them. It isn't really the actors' faults, because they are given nothing memorable to do (apart from the brightly colored crap with light sabers and so on) and very little memorable to say. Did any of what transpired in this film come as a surprise? as a revelation of character? This is the complete triumph of spectacle (in an Aristotelean sense) over any other of the six dramatic elements: no plot, no character, no diction, no thought, no music.I'm being somewhat hyperbolic there. Of course there is a plot. A plot ... exists. It's just that here -- as with the other items in that list -- we don't care about it, because it is not made to be intrinsically interesting. The point here is simply the brightly colored crap. Again and again and again and again and again. It is supposed to entertain the kids and keep them quiet, not make them ask questions, for gosh sake.",3,0,1,4 July 2007
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," i'm sorry, i found this film excruciating
","As with so many of Zemeckis' comedies, the overall _feeling_ of this film is akin to having a hebephrenic clown back you into a corner and start pulling things out of his giant bag of tricks: 'does THIS make you laugh? well what about THIS? isn't THIS funny? ha ha ha ha ha! laugh, you bastard, laugh!' And on and on and on.There is no air, no breathing space, nothing to measure all this desperate 'entertainment' against. Even Marx Brothers movies had lulls, not because they were flawed (though they sometimes were) but because the Marxes knew the value of varying the tone. They weren't straight slabs of 'HA! HA! HA! HA! WOW! WOW! HA!'Furthermore, I think the script of this movie stinks. Sorry, I guess. Zemeckis usually revolts me.",Null,1,7,27 October 2004
The Passion of Joan of Arc," on my desert island list
","I can well imagine that a lot of people might be (I shudder to type it) bored by this film. In my memory, it is all faces. And what faces! I don't know where one could find acting even close to this order of excellence today. It will give you an endless distaste -- if you don't already have one -- for the likes of Freddie Prinze Jr. Falconetti is simply beyond belief, and it is also fascinating to see one of Antonin Artaud's too-rare screen appearances. Absolutely an essential film for all time.",10,2,4,8 December 2002
Watchmen," I can't figure out why I didn't like it
","Watchmen, the graphic novel, was dark, brutal, and frequently thrilling.Watchmen, the movie, is dark, brutal, and ultimately flat and boring.For the life of me, I can't figure out why I feel this way. On a surface level this film seems to have done everything (well, almost everything) it could to be faithful to the universe Moore and Gibbons created. Obviously, a lot of people worked very hard to make this movie what it is.Perhaps it's the fact that none of the actors (with the exception of Jackie Earle Haley, pitch-perfect as Rorschach) seem to be doing very much. In their defense, it must be hard to breathe much life into these characters: who, for example, can find a connection with and breathe life into a god-like glowing blue guy, one of whose chief qualities is that he's feeling disconnected from humanity? I don't know, I confess.Still, they should have (says the former actor) found some way to do it ... and only one of them (Haley) did.I also have an irrational dislike of Patrick Wilson ... so that limits my appreciation of any film with him in it.As has become clich√©: the book was so much better. Sigh.",4,4,6,8 May 2014
Pitch Black," all in good fun
","I first saw _Pitch Black_ when I worked at SCIFI.COM. Attended a pre-release screening, which was a lot of fun.The movie was far better than I anticipated. Sure, in some ways it is a rip-off of _Alien_, but then _Alien_ was a rip-off of _It! The Terror From Beyond Space_ (and much more explicitly, too).Acting is across-the-board solid, though Radha Mitchell has some trouble covering her Aussie accent (it doesn't affect her performance). The effects are good: in a way I have to admire a 'little' film that simply processes various scenes in different-colored light -- to suggest the light of different stars -- as a 'special effect.' :^) I won't say anything about David Twohy's direction except to note that I have a very strong feeling he has a desperate crush on actress Radha Mitchell. The camera quite literally caresses her body, and especially her rear end, in a way that someone (not me) could describe as 'near pornographic.' Or maybe it's just my liking of short-haired blondes.That said, there is no nudity in this film. Lots of blood and cussing and nerve wracking suspense, though. You could easily spend 106 minutes in a less entertaining way. _Pitch Black_ has more surprises and unique twists than a half dozen Hollywood films.",7,0,1,18 June 2005
The Conjuring," no spoilers -- just a quick snark, unfortunately
","Will you think _The Conjuring_ is scary? And by 'scary' I mean something beyond jumping at loud and/or sudden things -- because those kinds of 'scares,' the amusement park kind, are easy to accomplish. There are plenty of those in this movie.Sadly, whether or not this movie finally scares you ultimately depends on whether or not you buy into the Judaeo-Christian mythos. It depends on whether or not you are a traditionally religious person ... because the makers of this film did not leave the 'evil' in this film as some vaguely-defined 'entity' ... noooo, this is a real live demon from a real live Christian Hell who doesn't like crucifixes and holy water a-tall, thank you very much.As a result, this movie scared me about as much as the story of Noah and the Ark scares me._The Conjuring_ is professionally-made entertainment, but so are recordings by Elton John -- and I don't like _those_, either.",4,1,3,23 November 2013
