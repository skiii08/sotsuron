The Ring," and my big sister said i wouldn't like it
","________________________WARING!!! SPOILERS!!!___________________
I saw this on the last day of school for the year with my friend. We were underaged but I SURVIVED THIS MOVIE!!!! my big sister said i'd hate it. sure it had a little girl who wanted to kill everyone and that freaky bit in the tape where she pulls her nail off her finger, but i loved it. and the bit where Samara comes out of the tv screen was pretty good although i thought it was slightly far fetched at first. then she kills the lead male and that shouldn't have happened, i persoanlly think. Beware, you MUST PEE first before u rent this out or see it in a cinema or u'll regret it. i give it 8/10. Great movie but takes at least two days of leaving the light on at night and also expecting to see Samara behind you.",8,0,0,7 December 2002
Snatch," funny as hell
",i couldn't belive how hilarious this movie was. brad pitt and vinnie jones and basically all the cast were awesome. i think this should have gotten more awards though. at least it was highly recommended. guy ritchie has got a quirky sense of humor-the script was funny! i have GOT to go see this again.,Null,1,2,10 April 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," embarresing
","this movie made my friend go to sleep while watching it also, the acting was crap, except for ewan mcgregor. the script was cliched and the only good bit was having little tiny yoda fighting a guy who was five feet bigger than him. and that thing with anakin touching amidala's skin saying how it isn't like sand? what is that??? i was dying to see the phantom menace and loved it, but...this one just sucked. another one of the few good bits was when ewan jumped through the big glass pannel when the alien thing went after amidala. don't see this film. it's not even fit to be called one.",Null,0,1,12 November 2002
54," VERY STYLISH
","i quite liked this movie. But why did they put neve on the front of the cover ? (sorry neve, you were really good though) i think that breckin meyer diserved to go on the front of the cover cause he was one of the main characters. neve was hardly in this at all. this movie isn't really like boogie night to me. boogie nights was about a teen who became a porno star. this is about a teen who starts to work at studio 54. there are some simularities though. the music was great and mike meyers was excellent as the owner of 54. see this film. but watch out, the trailer shows heaps of the neve-ster but really, she's hardly in this.",Null,0,1,3 October 2002
The Exorcist," oh my god!!!!!
","this is soooooooooo scary. but i like it. whatever you do, don't watch this at night time. i didn't, i watched it at 10 in the morning, but it scared the hell outta me! sometimes, i have a feeling that a ragen look alike is gonna come down the stairs at me. still, i like it. in scary movie 2, there is a take off of the exorsist in the beginning AND IT'S SO FUNNY!!!!! even though this was made quite some time ago, it's still the freakiest film around. if you see it, BEWARE. it'll make you waste electricity when you feel the need to leave the lights on after watching it. i didn't leave my lights on, i can't remember what i did...",Null,0,1,29 September 2002
The Green Mile," the acting was really good!
","wow. this film has got to be one of my favourites. I loved it. The actors were so cool. I'm giving it 9/10. An excellent piece of work.I hope Michael Clarke Duncan was nominated for his role, cause it was a winner! This movie's got it all: horror, comedy, romance, you name it. So if you like Stephen King SEE IT!!! And if you don't SEE IT ANYWAY!!",Null,1,2,28 September 2002
Blow," great music, great dvd, great actors
","i wanted to see this movie for awhile and it wasn't as good as i hoped it to be, but i still enjoyed it. Johnny Depp and Paul Ruebens were screen stealers for me as they were damn good. Penelope Cruz did well as Mirtha Jung that i hated the character! I still don't know if that's a good thing or not... i'm giving it 8 out of 10. See it if you like drug movies.",Null,0,1,28 September 2002
