The King's Speech," Chemistry between two of the finest actors on earth spectacular
","My wife and I see over 100 movies a year, having been in the business and now retired. WE DO NOT READ ANY REVIEWS BY ANYONE. WE TRY TO TELL OUR FRIENDS THAT A CRITIC IS ONE PERSON, HE OR SHE IS NOT US. Critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear.Therefore, our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theatre. Many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing room.Not a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction. How can you review a movie without the real deal? Geoffrey Rush is the top actor of our generation with only Daniel Day Lewis as a compliment. The man is superb and Colin Firth is equal to the task. The chemistry between the two is poignant, funny, agonizing and it results in another Academy Award movie and nominations for both.What a positive joy to see this movie with such great actors. Helena Bonham Carter is also her usual fantastic, she is just a fine fine actress. Kudo's to whomever put these guys together. Firth has made quite a few films, but not that approach this one.Enjoy.",10,8,16,1 January 2011

Walk the Line," Surely deserves Academy Award consideration!
","We start all of our reviews with the following information. My wife and I have seen nearly 100 movies per year for the past 15 years. Recently, we were honored by receiving lifetime movie passes to any movie any time at no cost! So we can see whatever we want whenever we want. The point of this is that CRITICS count for ZERO. Your local critics or the national critics like Ebert are really no different than you or me. The only difference is that they get to write about the movie and are forced to see hundreds of movies whether they want to or not.Therefore, it is our belief that if you get your monies worth for two hours of enjoyment that is good enough for us! We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon make this a wonderful movie. They are equally superb. The story is also quite riveting as it covers the life of Johnny Cash including much of the dark side of his life. Both actors sing wonderfully and it is very much worthy of Academy Award consideration for the Movie and each of the lead actors.",9,1,2,14 December 2005

Who wouldn't enjoy it besides the moronic critics. It is meant to be fun and that it is. So go and see it and don't listen to the critics. Who cares what Cruise does off screen. On screen he is terrific and his supporting cast are equal to the task. Enjoy.",8,0,1,8 May 2006
50 First Dates," Super Chemistry Adam and Drew!!
","These two have it going. In this their second movie together it is all that you expect and more from Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore. She looks stunning and this is one very very funny movie for Adam Sandler fans. Rob Schneider is of course part of the cast and he is his usual nutty, terrific self. Everyone in the audience loved the movie when we saw it as a sneak preview. Adam, we thought was extra special in this movie with a bit of a serious side to him in addition to his great form of comedy. Not too miss.  Want to see more movies with these two...",9,0,0,21 February 2004
Catch Me If You Can," Brillant! Tom Hanks absolutely great...Leo does a good job too.
","Wow! What a guy this was. His capers are fantastic and this real life story is portrayed spectacularly by Tom Hanks and DiCapprio pulls off the major role with ease. Steven Spielberg Directed, who can ask for anything more. This guy was simply fantastic and we loved this movie and the Tom Hanks character. Tom doesn't usually play second banana but he does it very well here and in our mind steals the show from Leo who does a very good job, but Hanks is Hanks.  Don't miss it.",8,0,0,31 December 2002
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Now a perfect 10+!
",20 years later the movie is a perfect 10+.  We saw the movie at the first showing on the first day in 1982 and did the same in 2002 with our children and grandchildren.  The new very simple changes have brought E.T. to a new level. The technology and genius of Stephen Spielberg is not to be outdone. My wife and I had the pleasure of watching the movie in 1982 with Stephen at a film festival for very few lucky invitees and we remember it to today.  He is the consumate professional.   You simply are not  movie fan if you don't rate this a perfect 10..... and 20 years later we cried again....,10,1,2,2 April 2002
Minority Report," Spielberg masterpiece!
","This is one of the best Spielberg movies of all time. Spielberg's signature is everywhere. It is simply a masterpiece. I love all the Spielberg touches... the cereal box, the talking billboards, the garden and all the effects. Tom Cruise is great in the movie and it is very suspenseful.  But it is purely and most definitely a Spielberg masterpiece. I continue to marvel at his work for all these years. This movie takes me back to ET which is our favorite movie of all time.  Don't miss it!  In fact see it twice because you will as usual with a Spielberg movie miss a lot of things the first go round.",10,0,0,21 June 2002
Meet the Parents," A perfect 10! for your entertainment dollar.
","Ben Stiller has established himself as a super star. He is so good and so funny and is quickly becoming the 'sane' more likeable version of Jim Carrey (whom I despise). His comedic talent is fantastic. DeNiro is always super and I believe he has launched a new career in his comedic roles. His facial expressions are wonderful, his timing and everything about him is great. We saw a preview of the movie last night and it was sold out and the house roared all the way through the entire movie. It is a must see movie. One of the funniest of the year. Ben continues his great work after keeping the faith and Mary..I can't wait for Meet the Parents II or for those in the know, meet the Maath-a-toon-em!",10,0,0,24 September 2000
Monster," We knew when we saw her in Cider House Rules. Charlize Theron is a genuine A list star.
","Charlize is simply gorgeous, fantastic, spectacular and her role and appearance and 30+ pounds for this movie prove that she can be as versatile as all the A list women. She simply takes your breath away in every movie she makes and in this one. While it is difficult to watch because her character was a real life MONSTER. SHe does a fabulous job as does co star Christina Ricci who has sure grown up. Hands down Oscar winner by far for Charlize.  Now we want to see her in a comedy role. Kudos to all who made this movie.",9,0,0,17 January 2004

Hotel Rwanda," Don Cheadle...Finally will get his calling. Wow!
","As one who feels that there is 'no best performance' for the Oscars but rather, everyone who is nominated is a 'best performance'. How can you possibly compare any one performance against another when the movies and stories are totally different. We loved many movies this year and feel they are worthy of nominations. We have already been rewarded by seeing that Natalie Portman and Clive Owens were honored by the foreign Press for a movie that we loved, but understood some would find it abhorrent. The line is drawn in the sand by Don Cheadle who we have always liked in every role he has played. He has been relegated the usual stereotypical roles for Black actors and it must be frustrating for him and the handful of very talented black actors and actresses who just don't get the great roles. Don Cheadle sets himself apart from every single actor in any movie of 2004. It is done by simply providing the best acting role in a movie about 'real events'. It makes us all ashamed of the fact that we were frozen to the TV watching OJ Simpson at the time that all of this took place. What a disgrace to us. As usual the world stood still and did nothing as in the Holocaust and the few other cases of genocide. The French true to their colors did nothing when they could have and should been first on the site. The English and Americans turned their backs as did the UN. Cheadle brings us to tears and cheers in this fascinating story of 'one man' who defies the odds against genocide of his own people. He is an outstanding actor and he surely deserves not only the nomination but the win as well. True, Leo was great as Hughes, Sideways is still something I cannot understand as to what the hub bub is about, Clint and Morgan were superb in Million Dollar baby, but none come close to Cheadle in this spectacular role of a lifetime. Bravo to Cheadle and those who had the guts to make this movie. Everyone from 8 to 108 should be required to see this movie as much if not equal to Schindlers List.",10,4,6,23 January 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Yes there are some darn good family films.And this should be on your list
","Simply 2 hours of fun, fun, laughter and more fun. The chemistry between this gang is great. It makes you want to have the jobs that they have. Making movies and having a great time and getting paid big dollars for it. Everyone in the movie will make you laugh. No language, no sex.. just plain fun. Julia Roberts is sensational as part of the gang. Catherine Zeta Jones is gorgeous beyond belief. The guys are all great and of course all the women will love them. George Clooney, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt... how can you go wrong. Don CHeadle, Carl Reiner and the remaining cast including a great cameo by Bruce Willis is very funny. Don't miss it or compare it to the other it is a totally different film and judged by itself it is worth taking the entire family.",8,1,6,11 December 2004

The Polar Express," 3D is the only way to see this movie!
","Seeing this movie in 3D with my kids and grandkids was incredible. The technology for the movie itself was incredible. It is impossible to understand or explain how they did it. It is totally different than the equally spectacular TOY STORY. Tom Hanks is the movie. The 3D is the star, it is breathtaking and the best 3D movie I have ever seen. We go to all of the 3D movies at IMAX and this one was simply the best. Anyone is sure to love this movie. Whether you are 3 or 93 you will marvel at the way this movie looks in 3D. It is impossible to explain you have to see it to believe it. What a wonderful surprise.Tom Hanks should be applauded for his involvement in this movie. He is an incredibly gifted actor as we all know, this departure for him was as good as his academy award pictures, but in a very different way. I think they said they made this movie in 35 days? Can that be possible in this age of $50 million movies?",8,3,7,1 January 2005

Closer," Wow! Not for the prim and proper but outstanding.
","CLOSER is nothing like advertised. The language in the movie is over the top compared to just about any movie ever seen. However, it is most appropriate for the story. Julia Roberts is outstanding as usual in this most unusual role for her complete with language that will not be for those of feint heart. We loved it. Natalie Portman is not an innocent beautiful young girl anymore, she is a full fledged Hollywood beauty in a role that even her OB/GYN father would blanch at. She is however fabulous. Jude Law also gives a terrific performance as he normally does. Newcomer Clive Owens is the perverted one, who also gives a very strong and very raw performance. Don't know where he came from but I'll bet he will be around for a long long time.Oscar will have a hard time picking who will it list from this movie. Mike Nichols direction deserves an Oscar. But the movie is bluer than blue and that might scare away some voters. Be prepared for those words that you have not seen very much on screen in a mainstream movie. have fun",9,10,16,4 December 2004

The Intouchables," One of the best movies ever seen in 50 yrs
","This is one of the best movies we have ever seen. My wife and I see 3 movies a week on average over The past 40 years. Saying it is one of the best is quite a statement. This French movie with sub titles is simply Spectacular. The storyline involves a man crippled in An accident, his wife has passed away and he cannot Find adequate help which he requires 24/7. Until he meets the Most unlikely of people to care for him. The acting by Omar Sy & Mr. Cluzet Is the very best. The movie has everything you want in a Movie. It has compassion and is spectacularly Funny. Run to see this movie. The two prime Actors must be recognized for a whole host Of awards. Wow!",10,26,38,3 June 2012
The Pianist," WE MUST NEVER FORGET! This is a spectacular film!
",This film is still another story about the darkest times in our history. It is beautifully done and should receive all the kudos it has been getting.

Million Dollar Baby," How can a movie or a cast be any better?
","2005 has started off with a big big bang for my wife and I. Million Dollar baby is a sure fire Acadamey Award nominee in several categories and how can you possibly choose who and what should win. Everything about this movie from the writing, directing, acting and even the music by Clint Eastwood is brilliant. Hillary Swank is once again one of our best actresses.. Don't know why she doesn't make more movies and do some as a 'real lady' which she certainly is. Her portrayal as a white trash girl from the sticks who wants to be a boxing champion is very believable and she is perfect in the role. The chemistry between her and the fabulous Clint Eastwood who I believe is past 70 years old is wonderful. Clint is simply great in anything that he does, from those old spaghetti westerns, to Dirty Harry to the comedies, acting, directing, singing, you name it and he can do it as good as anyone else. He is a fall back to the greats of Hollywood goneby. What can you say about Morgan Freeman. I can listen to his voice for hours and be satisfied. He is mesmerizing with his tones. As an actor, he too is so versatile and fantastic that he has not gotten the appreciation that he should be getting. He is one of the finest actors in Hollywood who just goes along making movie after movie and each one is of the top caliber. He is great as the go between with Clint Eastwood and Hillary Swank in this movie and he does it with such ease. I would love to see him finally get the recognition he deserves by not only getting nominated but actually winning the academy award which he so richly deserves.",9,4,7,9 January 2005

A riveting two plus hours of entertainment with spectacular scenery and a story that is all too familiar in this terrible world we live in. Djimon Hounson gives a spectacular performance worthy of an Academy Award. Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Connelly are equal to the task. This looks like multi Academy Awards to me. Simply a beautiful yet horrifying movie because of the subject matter. Wow Wow Wow. Kudos to everyone who made this movie possible.",10,1,3,9 December 2006
The Last Samurai," florida
","This is one perfect movie. We have only given a perfect 10 to very very few movies in last few years. Tom Cruise and co start Ken Watanbe are worthy of Oscar buzz and the picture itself is spectacular. The costumes and scenery and everything about this picture are wonderful. Lives up to all the hype and more. Went into the theatre thinking I wouldn't like it, came out raving about it and recommending it to everyone.  Wow! Kudos to Tom and Ken.",10,1,3,5 December 2003

Ron Howard did a great job with everything in the movie from the sets to music. Controversy? I saw none. This is only a movie and it is very suspenseful and makes you think what if? What is wrong with What if? I very much was against the passion movie because I felt it was too bloody and insulting and trash from Mel Gibson. This is a movie from a book that has sold 45,000,000 copies and if you are looking to be entertained for 2 1/2 hours, that is what you will get. The talk after the movie by all of the people in the theater was extremely interesting as the most common thought I heard was. What is the controversy that is so upsetting to the church? It is a movie based on what if? How many people out there have ever wondered if Jesus had a child? How is anyone to know the answer. There is nothing written about Jesus until 70 years after his death. Not one eyewitness took the time to write, draw, scribble or anything about his life. It is all stories made up just as the bible was. The Romans sat and made up rules and regulations and it was just like a senate hearing. So go and have a great time and have an open mind. It is only a movie.",10,1,7,19 May 2006
Mystic River," Superb! Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, entire cast
","The perfect movie. Exciting, entertaining and the performances are oscar worthy. Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, Kevin Bacon, Laura Linney all perfect. Sean Penn may not be your cup of tea in real life, he is ours. He is a superb actor as is Tim RObbins, Kevin Bacon and the entire cast. Clint Eastwood's direction was terrific. Oscar nominations for sure.   And by the way screw the right wing.",10,1,2,19 October 2003

Wedding Crashers," Two Hours of absolute laughter.... One of the best of the year
","We go to the movies for entertainment and enjoyment and a few laughs. This movie is one of the funniest we have ever seen. It is pure fun from start to finish. Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson have a franchise movie here, one that should continue on for many sequels. Christopher Walkin is spectacular as is the very gorgeous Jane Seymour. Belly laughs and toilet humor are simply out of this world and the girls are all gorgeous. I know that every boy and girl of age will absolutely fall in love with these guys and gals. Don't miss it. It is surely one of the funniest movies of the year. The young starlets in the movie are equal to the task as foils for the boys. The concept is brilliant and it works just fine.. Not for those under 13 but a don't miss for those 14-96.. have fun.",10,5,11,15 July 2005
Man on Fire," Denzel and Dakota what a combination! Wow!
","Denzel Washington and Dakota Fanning both deserve consideration for Academy Award nominations for this wonderful chemistry filled movie. They have simply delicious chemistry together, this 10 year old is a veteran of more than 5 movies already and in each and everyone she has done spectacularly. It is time to recognize her work and nominate her for an academy award. She is simply a 30 year old in the body of a 10 year old.  Denzel is his usual academy award level presentation. THe movie is quite suspenseful and violent and delicious at the same time. It is not for children under 13. The first half of the movie shows the great chemistry grow between Denzel and Dakota and the second half is non stop action, violence and the search.  Not for the squemish. We loved it and recommend it to anyone who is a fan of Denzel and should be a fan of the newest hottest little girl in hollywood. go and see it today...",8,0,0,24 April 2004
Hitch," Will Smith certified as biggest box office star at this time!
","Critics, Critics, Critics they are all out of sorts about most every movie. People like us are the ones that count. I only read the reviews here on IMDb to see if I will like a movie or not. Critics who are paid should get a real job. They did not like this movie. What do they expect? I expect to get my monies worth and spend two fun hours. This one does that and more. Will Smith and sexy Eva Mendes are simply wonderful in this very funny movie. All predictable, but who cares. Kevin James is also very funny in his first movie role. We enjoyed it, you will enjoy it. It is plain and simple a fun night out for the entire family. That's right you can even take the kids. No sex, no cursing, just plain ole fun. Kudos to Will Smith who is a very talented young man and stats say he is the most bankable Hollywood star as to the money aspect. We personally hated the MIB series and many of his movies, but this one is just plain fun. So forget the critics, take a look at the reviews right here by your own peers and the box office of more than $50 million in the first two weeks.",9,0,1,19 February 2005

It is shades of the Bush Administraton with a couple of very good digs at them. Kate Mara is gorgeous and a rising star. Don't miss it. Action packed from the minute it starts to the very end.",10,4,11,24 March 2007
The Terminal," Another PERFECT 10 for Spielberg and Hanks
","We have seen 28 movies thus far this year and this one is the very best of the year todate. Certainly worthy of Academy Award nominations for the movie, Spielberg and Hanks.  Only Spielberg could make a movie like this, filmed entirely at the airport that he built completely from scratch including all the stores. Tom Hanks is spectacular in this movie while barely speaking english for the entire movie.  Catherine Zeta is simply wonderful and gorgeous as usual.  The supporting cast of Chi Mc Bride, Stanely Tucci and the others is perfect.  A can't miss film that can be seen by the entire family.  You will laugh hysterically and cry and have a great time. The entire audience stood and applauded as the credits rolled by.There is not better testament to a movie when the people in the audience react like that.   Don't miss it.   Kudos to Spielberg and Hanks and everyone who made and wrote this movie.",10,1,3,11 June 2004

We NEVER EVER listen or read the critics. We only care about our friends and those who we know like the same things as us. Well enough about that.We subscribe to just about anything about Israel and from Israel and we have received many reviews and mostly UNKIND words about this movie. Now after seeing it, we can't understand what in the world they are talking about. I guess interpretation is the only word that comes to mind. But we were not offended by anything in the film and thought it was magnificent. How anyone on the entire planet could ever think that Steven Spielberg who is the #1 supporter of Israel would ever do something that was unkind to Israel is just not worthy of comment. Steven has spent much of his adult life giving and giving and giving to the people of Israel and the Holocaust survivors. This movie was INSPIRED BY EVENTS it is not a documentary. It is simply spectacular and is a wonderful MOVIE. The entire movie is about a group of secretive Israeli's who seek revenge for this disgusting real life murders. In history, there have never been a single word leaked as to who these people were and what exactly they did.... That is not the entire truth is known or will ever be known. Eric Bana deserves academy award nomination and the entire cast are relative unknowns with the exception of Oscar winner Geoffrey Rush who is always terrific. See you at the Academy Awards master Spielberg.",10,2,5,27 December 2005
Shall We Dance," The Perfect Movie!
","Wow! We saw the sneak preview and it was simply spectacular. Richard Gere is simply wonderful as a dancer in this terrific role. He shines throughout the movie as does the one and only J Lo. SHe is gorgeous, sexy a fantastic body and wonderful dancer. And not a single kiss in the entire movie with Gere. The other members of this cast will have you rolling in the aisles. Stanley TUcci shows more of his versatility and is equally wonderful as is Gere in the movie as a closet dancing lawyer. Bobby Cannavale who is beginning to show up everywhere on the small screen in roles as tough guys is a fabulous dancer and comedian in this movie. The very huge Omar Benson Miller who you have seen time and again in a stereotypical 'Black man' role is wonderful and a dancer, comic and just wonderful in this quite a jump from his usual roles where is has been a fine fine serious actor. We loved it and recommend it highly. We hope that it catches the attention of the Academy as it is so refreshing and different that it deserves nominations for any and all of the folks in the movie and I am sure it will garner many golden globe awards because it is a 'musical' love story of sorts... the love of dancing.",10,0,1,2 October 2004
Thirteen Days," Great movie, Glad I didn't know how close we were...Bush?
",What a wonderful piece of history. I am glad that I didn't know how close we were to war at the time. It was frightening enough with what they told us in 1962. As I was riveted to the movie because I knew the characters and the history I drifted away for a moment and thought in horror...about Bush being in that position. Heaven help us! All of the stars were right on in their portrayal. Kevin Costner was great as Kenny O'Donnell as was Bruce Greenwood as President Kennedy and Steven Culp as Bobby Kennedy. If you were there you should not miss this movie. Certainly as Oscan contender.,9,1,2,18 January 2001
The Ugly Truth," Wow! Spectacular and nothing like trailer
","Wow! A huge fantastic surprise not at all like trailers. R rated for language and sexual situations. Another Superbad Knocked Up. Hilarious from start to finish. Audience loved it. Heigl is adorable, beautiful, sexy and damn funny. Gerard Butler is also terrific. This is not the expected Romantic Chick Flick. The guys will love it even mote than the ladies. It is so so funny. Word of mouth should push this movie way over $100 million mark. Quite frankly both my wife and I were not thrilled with Heigl before we saw this for her whiny pissy year on Grey's. This movie brought us back into her corner she is a fantastic actress and will be successful for years. You will love the scene that is so funny and brings to mind Meg Ryan's great scene in Harry meets Sally. So get ready for no holds barred. Sex talk, words u will laugh at and those who are prudish. Don't go! Can you tell we loved it",10,5,24,24 July 2009
Gangs of New York," Wow! Just as the critics said and more
","What a fantastic job done by Scorsese.. The set designs, the story, everything about this movie is great. Daniel Day Lewis is sure to get an academy award nomination and has a great chance to win.

The Fighter," WoW! Mark Wahlberg, Amy Adams and Christian Bale
","My wife and I see over 100 movies a year, having been in the business and now retired. WE DO NOT READ ANY REVIEWS BY ANYONE. WE TRY TO TELL OUR FRIENDS THAT A CRITIC IS ONE PERSON, HE OR SHE IS NOT US. Critics are also a dying breed as newspapers disappear.Therefore, our critique is not biased and based on actually seeing the movie in a theatre. Many critics see the movies 5 at a time in a viewing room.Not a real atmosphere to gauge audience reaction. How can you review a movie without the real deal?A great movie with all three stars giving Academy Award performances Amy Adams,Mark Wahlberg and Christian Bale. One of the best fight films we have ever seen.Amy Adams does her usual fabulous job in still another type of roll. Wahlberg has become a terrific actor and director and Christan Bale steals the movie with his great acting. Don't miss it.",10,2,4,17 December 2010
