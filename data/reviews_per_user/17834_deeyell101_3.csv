The Rock," Don't let appearances fool you
","On the face of it, this just seems to be yet another action movie by Jerry Bruckheimer, with big muscles, and bigger guns. However, it is in fact a pretty good movie, thanks mainly to the fact that the main character, Stanley Goodspeed (played by Nicolas Cage) is not a gung-ho, all American hero. He does not relish being in his position (stuck on Alcatraz with a bunch of crazy SEALS and crazier marines armed with big fat missiles), and has some dry lines which he uses well. I won't reveal the plot, but its not up to much anyway, so no loss there... Sean Connery as usual, delivers a James Bond performance - the only kind of role he can pull off - as an ex-SAS, ex-MI6 agent, who was imprisoned on Alcatraz and escaped. (By the way, isn't it funny how all the British guys in action films seem to be SAS soldiers or spies - you'd think we were trained to trained to whip up a Vodka Martini from birth!) Anyway, the best bit of the movie in my opinion is when Connery says: 'losers always whine about their best. Winners go home and f**k the prom queen'. The only problem I had with the movie, (and it is seriously minor), is that one of the marines punches Sean Connery, and says, 'f**king English prick, did I ever tell you my father was Irish?' Sean Connery is SCOTTISH!!! What an ignorant thing to say! The Irish have got absolutely no problem with the Scots, and it is typical Hollywood attitude to classify all of the UK as England. Next thing we know, they'll be saying that Europe is one country! Anyway, sorry for nattering on; in conclusion, The Rock is an above average action film, and well worth renting out.",Null,2,2,29 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," NO SPOILERS
","If you are a Star Wars fan (like me), you will love this movie. If you aren't you will love it anyway, but on a different level. George Lucas has given just about everyone a light-sabre, and there are some terrific battles, far better then anything in the other Star Wars movies. You see an entire army of Jedis, running forward and smashing aside laser blasts with their light sabres, and then crashing into an army of droids, which is truly satisfying, and the young Anakin Skywalker and Obi-Wan fighting back to back, which is a bit ironic really, considering what will happen in the later movies. Anyway, the battles are brilliant, and Yoda gives everyone a big surprise by turning up and showing us all just why he is the Jedi master. Unfortunately, the acting was pretty rubbish: Natalie Portman, who plays Amidala was completely flat, and Anakin Skywalker just couldn't pull off the bits when he wasn't angry. Samuel L Jackson was a bit of a disappointment too; he is an excellent actor, but was held back by the script. However, Ewan Mcgregor was excellent as Obi-Wan, and acted the part really well. No worries though, as the acting was never Star Wars' strong point, and the battles truly make up for it. There were also lots of references to the later movies: Anakin has his arm chopped off, we are shown how the Bounty Hunter Boba Fett came to be, and there is a brilliant line, when Obi-Wan says to Anakin, 'I have a feeling you will be the death of me.' So anyway, if you have not seen this movie, go and see it, as it is pretty damn good. Well done George Lucas, I can't wait for the next one!",Null,0,0,19 May 2002
Pulp Fiction," Theories for what is in the briefcase (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER)
","A totally amazing film - my favourite, and I've seen it about 10 times because I have it on video. Amazing acting, direction, and the dialogue is the best in any film I've ever seen. But what I'm posting the comment about, is what is in the briefcase that Jules (Samuel L. Jackson) is willing to risk his life to protect. There are many theories, but here is my favourite: Marcellus Wallace (the big black guy) has a plaster on the back of his head. This is because he has had his soul removed and he has sold it to the Devil. The soul is in the briefcase (the code for which is 666). The guys who eat the Tasty Kahuna Burgers are Hell's Angels, transporting the soul in the briefcase to the Devil. Jules and Vincent (Jackson and Travolta) are angels, and are out to intercept the soul and return it to Marcellus Wallace. The theory is more intricate, and I do not know where Bruce Willis and Harvey Keitel etc. fit in, but that is the bare bones. I advise you to watch the film again, bearing this in mind.",Null,1,2,5 July 2002
