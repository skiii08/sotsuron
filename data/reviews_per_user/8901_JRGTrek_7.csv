Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Great Film.
","I've read through a lot of reviews here and I gotta ask what film you people were seeing? I've seen it four times and while the first was exciting beyond belief, the 3 following times were just as fun. This was a good film. Not as good as The Empire Strikes Back, but better than Jedi. I mean the film is good. Here are the things I like the Most about the Film: 1. Qui-Gon Jinn. This guy was awesome. 2. Queen Amidala, She had the same kind of strength and determination as Princesses Leia did in the orginials. 3. Special Effects. God, they were good. Much like A New Hope, Lucas Film Ltd. and ILM has set a new standard in Special Effects. 4. Darth Maul. Unlike Vader, you could see his facial expressions that made him look more evil. This guy would whoop Vader's ass in a lightsaber duel. 5. Pod Race. The Noise pollution was great in this part of the film. 6. Ewan McGregor as Obi-Wan Kenobi. I could swear that was just a computer enhanced Alec Guinness at times. hehe. 7. The Queen's Captain. That guy was awesome too. Who ever he was, was probably the best actor in this movie. He showed concern for the Queen and gave his opinion forcefully. 8. Darth Sidious. Ok, we don't know who he is yet, but hey he had the voice of the Dark Side. 9. Battle Droids. Great Idea, why doesn't the emperor save time and money in the orginals and use battle droids? 10. Watto, he had some great lines and was generally cool. 11. Gungan City. How could such a dippy race have such a cool city. 12. There's gonna be 2 more after this one. Lucas has said that he made this one light hearted, because the next two are gonna be rather dark. 13. C3PO. Ok, in this movie he was the best. 'I find that Jar-Jar to be quite odd in deed.' One of the best lines in the movie. 14. Senator Palpatine talking to Anakin. 'And you young Skywalker, we will watch your career with great interest.' Yep, you bet. 5 things I hated in this movie, just like the orginial 3 there were sucky moments. 1. Anakin's mom. Bleh. Over actress. Terrible job and terrible dialog. 2. Jar-Jar Binks. An inappropriate character for this movie. but wow did he look real. Not as bad as Anakin's Mom. 3. The Gungan-Battle Droid fight. Still better than the Ewok-Stormtropper fight, more believeable too. 4. Miti-clorains? A scientific way to tell if the force is with them, what's with this? 5. No Han Solo. I know he's not even born yet, but man Han was awesome in the other three.",10,0,0,20 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," More than just eye candy!
","So far a lot of reviews have said that a lot of this movie is a lot of mere eye-candy. To me it was that and much more. If this was made in 1977, it wouldn't have been as big of a hit as would be now. But since we love the classics so much, we didn't mind waiting in line for 2 hours or 10 minutes, whatever! It was a good film, and much like other people, I loved the pod-race. It kicked ass. Damn Sand People, ha ha. Jar-Jar and the two headed announcer weren't as bad as people said. Jar-Jar had some funny lines and the announcer was almost as real as those guys on NASCAR races or whatever. Coruscant was an awesome city, so was the under water world. The ending seemed much like A New Hope, no metals, but it was generally happy and a kick-ass party. (Not giving much away there). Now you're probably saying: jeez is there anything you didn't like about the movie? Well, yeah. No Vader and no Solo. Darth Sidious and Darth Maul were cool bad guys, Maul was too quiet he needed to say something. Sidious has a mystery behind him. Who is he? What are his motives? What's he after? Questions to be answered in the next 2 films. C3PO didn't get much time, but he wasn't as emotional as the other movies. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor worked well together. Jake Lloyd is ok for someone who's only 10 years old. Natalie Portman did a good job, but it seemed her accent changed a little too much. For Me: 4 Stars. 2 Thumbs up. 9.5 outta 10. Great Movie. Thank-you George for yet another chapter in Star Wars!",10,0,1,19 May 1999
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," My all time favorite.
","I think people under the age of thirty won't appreciate this film as much as some of us older folks (I'm only 35).Despite the fact that I'm only 19 and that how much I loved Star Trek II, this one will always be my favorite movie. From the beginning to end it was a great movie. I know it's probably not 100% realistic, but the people in it made it a great movie and one that most people have no idea about. I told my friends in high school that I liked this movie and they never heard of it or said that they heard it wasn't good. It's one of the few movies I've watched on AMC. Jerry.",Null,0,3,13 March 1999
Back to the Future Part III," One of the 3 best.
","Of all three of the movies, I saw this one last. I think at times it seemed to stand still and not go anywhere, like when they started to talk about Doc staying in 1885 and the Party just seemed like a filler, just something to fill the movie up with. The best moments where in 1955 and after they saved Clara. It was a good movie, but it didn't really appeal to me the way the other two did.",Null,0,0,27 February 1999
Back to the Future Part II," #1.
","This has been and always will be my favorite out of the trilogy. First, they went to a future that looked much like the pretty cool 30 years later. The Cubs won the World Series, they still have newspapers, everything seems hopeful and optimistic about the future. It looks like everything is going fine until Marty bought that damn book. You could tell this one has a little bit deeper plot compared to the first and third one. I think that this one shows the real trouble of time traveling and why there should be no attempt to do so.",10,1,2,27 February 1999
The Matrix," WHOA!
","When I first saw the trailer for this, I was thinking: 'Oh great, another Sci-Fi film with awesome special effects and probably nothing else good.' I went to see it yesterday. I'm still picking up my jaw a day later. Wow, what a film. It is the best written, best acted Sci-Fi movie since Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back. It was absolutely fantastic. I couldn't believe how great that movie was. It was a 10 from start to finish and the greatest film of the year, until The Phantom Menace comes out in a month. A big thanks for everyone who made a wonderful movie experience.",10,1,1,19 April 1999
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," When I first saw it.
","I was disappointed. I saw Return of the Jedi and The Empire Strikes Back before I ever saw A New Hope. I thought Owen and Beru's dying was a bad way to get Luke off the farm. I wanted a big argument between Luke Obi-Wan and Owen. Then at the end when Luke got the honor of destroying the Death Star was a little cheesy and such. The Light Saber duel was bad, yawn. That was when I was 10 years old. I'm now 19 and I still think A New Hope is not the best out of the 3. It's a great movie and the Special Editions were awesome, it didn't get me hooked like Empire and Jedi did. It made me wonder how this film got well over 300 million in the late 70's.",10,0,2,2 June 1999
