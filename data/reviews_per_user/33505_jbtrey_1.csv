First Man," I'll be brief,
","I wish the movie had been. At 2:21, it's 2:00 too long.No character development at all, just 2:21 of Ryan Gosling performing various space tasks with his 'Stoic Man' face. Boring, boring, boring.i feel that if I take more than 5 minutes to write this review, I have wasted even more minutes of my life than I did in the theatre. Suffice it to say that if you insist on seeing this film, I recommend waiting on the video. Oh, and lesson be learned - you can't make a good space movie without Ed Harris. ðŸ˜ŽðŸ˜Ž",1,22,35,15 October 2018
