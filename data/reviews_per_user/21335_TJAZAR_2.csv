The Blair Witch Project," A masterpiece
","'The Blair Witch Project' is, quite simply, a masterpiece.  It is totally original, and unlike anything you've seen before.  The horror element in this movie is completely different from most other horror movies.  It's what you don't see that scares you.  From the humorous beginning to the shocking end, 'The Blair Witch Project' delivers on all counts.  And, for those who say, 'Since it's not real, it's not scary,' I offer this tidbit.  It may not be real, but, wouldn't you admit the fact that after you saw 'Jaws', you were somewhat afraid of the water?",10,4,8,18 July 1999
Pitch Black," Terrific sci-fi
","'Pitch Black' was a great sci-fi/horror movie.  Vin Diesel displayed a terrific performance as the convict Riddick, being scary and comforting simultaneously.  The story was well crafted, and the beginning showed more than a little resemblance to the PC game 'Unreal,' but quickly paved its own path.  The special effects were excellent, especially in the opening crash scene.  And the musical score was very appropriate, with rapidly pounding drums that got the blood pumping.  I highly recommend seeing this movie, but be prepared to get scared.",7,0,0,19 February 2000
