The Blair Witch Project," Very Creepy!
","Perhaps now the rest of Hollywood will realize that what is scary is what you don't see, not flashy special effects. I saw it the same weekend I saw 'The Haunting' and there was no comparison. 'The Haunting' left me feeling nothing, where the 'Blair Witch' left me thinking all the way and into the evening.",10,1,2,1 August 1999
