The Blair Witch Project," A True classic of psychological horror
","Out of every horror film ever made, nothing has dug itself into my personal fears, to such and extent, as The Blair Witch Project. upon my first viewing i was aware that this documentary style horror film was entirely fiction, yet that didn't stop me from being genuinely frightened. It is a criminally underrated film, often critically snapped for being a giant cheap gimmick or scare tactic, also, the rather grim, terrifying and unrevealing conclusion left some disappointed. Yet having the mystery unrevealed is what makes this titles so compelling, what is hunting down these characters and why, what form does the presence take, what is the meaning of all these signs, rocks and symbols, it is this confusion that creates the claustrophobia and fear. that feeling of impending doom is maintained throughout the piece. The amateur actors are simply fantastic, applying Stanislavski method acting techniques to give their performances vivid realism. This film really has to be seen to be believed, just don't expect a blood bath, or an all out scare fest, this one is a pressure cooker of suspense, tension and claustrophobia, its a slow builder and requires a patient viewer.Verdict: Masterpiece",10,1,3,9 March 2007
Alien 3," An Awkward, but brilliant film
","I've read reviews of this film that called it one of the worst films ever made. I have to disagree. Alien 3 had a troubled production and considering that the script wasn't even completed halfway through it's intense shoot, director David Fincher crafts a great film in his own original style, against commercial mass audience appeal. Exerything from swapping Director of photography in the middle of the shoot and meddling studio executives caused great stress for Fincher. Despite this, his feature film debut is a grueling, dark masterpiece that is stylish, terrifying and deeply moving. I love the ending, emotional, superb, and once again against audience expectation. A strong performance again from Weaver and supporting cast, i loved Charles Dances' sarcastic doctor, all the rest of the characters are generally undesirable I strongly urge that you view it again, naysayers, it might even grow on you, especially considering that audiences have become more accustomed to finishes dark style since SEVEN, FIGHT CLUB and even PANIC ROOM. Yet i do recommend the Directors cut over the Theatrical cut.",8,2,5,19 September 2005
Mission: Impossible III," Huge fun
","I'm pretty sure everyone knew this film wasn't going to be a masterpiece, De Palmer's version definitely came very close. But mi3 just takes you by the collar and doesn't stop shaking. The opening scene of the film is intense and fantastic. Hoffman true to form in a icy performance. The action is great, the pace never slackens. Cruise is back in form, i honestly like the guy and i wish people would stop being so pedantic. Back to the film though, it truly is a tense film, especially the last five minutes, followed by a huge pay off, you simply must see this, not perfect, but so much fun to watch. Old school cruise is back.",10,2,5,20 May 2006
Superbad," Glorious Taboo strippage 'lets get felashed'
","Seth Rogan, talent is all i can say. A cast of talented unknowns, a dynamite script. A damn good time, there are some films that give off no indication as to why they are so loved, like the Rocky Horror Picture Show as an example. Superbad's main card is that it is, strikingly honest in it's comedic situations, it's a film that anyone who was ever a young male, can relate too. Though females may find little humor in this film, men will be in stitches. I can see countless offended viewers that may walk out of this film offended, shocked. It is all an act, it's just too true for them to handle. That policeman may not be entirely perfect, that boys do have penis' and girls do have vagina's. That sex is good, that the moments that the world tells us to forget are the best times of our lives. Enjoy Superbad for it's glorious political incorrectness.Virdict: Bring out the lubricant!!!!",10,17,35,6 October 2007
The Prestige," Nolan not a one trick magician
","My goodness, Christopher Nolan is on a roll, after his stellar, mind-bending debut 'Momento' and his superb Batman Re-invention, Nolan has paused to show his versatility before embarking on The Batman Sequel 'The Dark Knight' to give us 'The Prestige'. It's a dark,almost Shakespearian film about two Magicians, both friend's and rival's, who's passion for the performance of magic turns into a bitter obsession to outwit each other. This obsession becomes a dangerous cat and mouse game of intrigue, jealousy, after a tragic event, but what is illusion in this deadly game, and who is fooling who.The first thing that must be commented on is the magnificent script by the Nolan brothers, complex and impeccably executed. Secondly A superb cast. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cain, Scarlett Johanisson, David Bowie, the cast does a magnificent job, particularly Bale and Jackman. Bale in an intense and cold performance, Jackman flawlessly switching from vulnerability to intensity with ease. It's also nice to see Ziggy Stardust himself working those acting chops in a welcome performance, playing against type.I can't recommend this film enough. Intelligent, sophisticated, Hollywood film-making has returned.",10,2,3,16 November 2006
Silent Hill," Dark, disturbing, operatic and powerful
","Christophe Gans has created a visceral masterpiece. The film has been roughly described by many as Alice in Wonderland meets Dante's Hell, and this is a very appropriate description. The film is simple, it's a journey that satisfies a humans gnawing curiosity about evil, deep down we'd all want to know what purgatory looks like without ending up there. A talented cast including the always great Alice Kridge, Radna Mitchel and Sean bean, and great writing from Academy Award Winner Roger Avery (Pulp Fiction) make for a sublime cinematic trip. Yet i can say most of the credit must go to the awesome production designers who have created a visual feast for the eyes. At times the film can divulge into directors self indulgence but after all the overrated tripe, Hostel, Wolf Creek, Haute tension and a couple of unnecessary, terrible remakes, Silent Hill undoubtedly stands as one of the best horror films of the year.",10,2,4,5 September 2006
28 Weeks Later," Rip roaring, Genre explosion, takes the series to a whole new level
","28 Weeks Later, the sequel to the Danny Boyle art-house horror cult smash, was at the bottom of the list of movies one would look forward to. The first film was, in my opinion, an overlooked classic, it was raw, realistic and the performances from Cillian Murphy and troop where tour-DE-force. The thought of American's invading a British horror film made many worried, and it was quite distracting throughout the film, but it doesn't suffer much from it, and the film-makers wisely don't take it too far. Very much like Aliens (the action packed sequel to Alien) 28 Weeks Later is much more action orientated, and elevates the mythology of the first film to a whole new level. There are some truly thrilling moments in the film, some of the highlights being the napalm detonations, and night vision sequence in the subway, the night vision sequence is easily one of the most terrifying moments in cinema this year. The script is of high caliber, but is does have some frustrating moments, particularly the fact that most of the problems the characters face, are due to lack of communication between the characters. But these quibs are minor. Other impressive mensionables is the two young leads, who have the almighty task of carrying the film, they do a fantastic job. The film also smartly re-uses God Speed You Black Emperor and John Murphy's superb rock score, and the all round style of the first film is maintained, the only difference being the first film was shot on DV, this one on film. If your a fan of the first film, you'll go ga ga over 28 Week's, it's the quintessential blood soaked adrenaline rush, and one of the best sequels i've seen in a long time.Verdict: Bring a seat to hide under.",9,149,294,15 May 2007
The Hills Have Eyes," Technically brilliant...but morally unsound
","I have to say i'm an avid horror fan, i think horror movies are fascinating in the way they satisfy the senses that audiences are unable to admit to. Human beings are fascinated by violence, and not just anyone, all humans, it is in our nature to be violent.The Hills have eye's is the remake of the relatively unknown 70's cult horror film by Wes Craven. The remake has all the ingredients of a great horror film, superb performances, great cinematography, great music. Now tell me what element is missing from that list?I had already heard beforehand of the films graphic content, and had prepared myself for the absolute worst, Cinema is an experience to be had, Jumping into controversial material is a great joy personally.One scene and one scene only spoils this film for me, the rape scene, it is despicable. In fact the whole trailer scene, the first attack, is most awful. It crosses the line. The film is not all that original, and i wasn't having fun while watching the film, i found it to be verging on sadist porn. The final half hour though i thrilling, but it is out weighed to the down points.Recommendation: Well.....Not recommended",6,0,0,19 November 2007
The Machinist," A great ode to the classic days of Polanski and Repulsion
","A great film, albeit a little predictable. Christian Bale is brilliant in this film, his abhorrent weight loss is the most disturbing aspect. The film follows an insomniac, Trevor Reznik, and the paranoid mystery that plagues him. After a horrific work related accident, due to the sudden appearance of a mysterious stranger, Resnik is thrown into a spiral slide to either madness, truth or both. This film is not particularly original, but it does have a soul, at times it is painfully predictable, at other times, terrifying because of it's unpredictability. It won't go down as a classic of the genre, but is instead a nice rental. Recommended!",7,3,5,12 December 2006
Independence Day," A testament to an innocent time, a more Naive America
","Yep... i loved this film as a child, i was awestruck by its effects, yet when i watched it with my parents, i could never figure out why they would roll there eyes and laugh. So here i am, 10 years later, aware and awake in this delicate political time, still shocked in the reality that 9/11 actually happened, and understanding the humor they found in this film. Its pretty simple, it glorifies America in vulgar fashion, when America was an indestructible world power saving themselves from everything, the Cuban missile crisis, German invasion and now, even an Alien invasion..wow. though we won't mention the great tragedy that was the Vietnam war. Americans don't like losing, and don't like to admit it, they are a great country,and maybe in the wake of the last 6 years, they can admit that their country has problems. And that is why i think this film is so special, it reminds me of my childhood mindset, when America ruled the earth with an iron fist, and i wanted to move to LA to become an movie star.... a rock star, Those dreams have past.",8,0,2,6 September 2006
Batman Begins," Works at its best, when it isn't a batman film.
","In my opinion the very fact that this film was a batman film is the element that weakened it. It seem to work so much better when it was character building, in the first 40 minutes. I found as soon as our hero put on the black cape the film didn't work, it lost its attention to detail, sloppily slipping in and out of sentiment. I think Christian Bale is a great performer, his performance in American Psyco and his butt kicking gun carter from the cult hit Equilibrium, have proved his presence. His performance as Bruce Wayne is deep and rooted, but as soon as he plays batman, it becomes a rather cheesy affair. The same can be said for Cillian Murphy, who is suitably sinister as a corrupted Phycologist, but his character nose dives with the cheesy lines of the Scarcrow character. I have to say this now that Katie Holmes is a promising performer yet her performance is rather poor here, not terrible though. Another problem with this film is the music, not denying the prowess of such grand performers as Hans Zimmer(Gladiator) and James Newton Howard (The sixth sense). Unforortunately these two creative forces collide like two power sources canceling each other out. The composers music worked much better when it was separated. Howards sweeping emotional score, with Zimmers synthesized epic quality. Yet personally i would have just gone with Howard, for a strong emotion suspense score. forget Zimmer as he didn't suit this film. Yet not all is lost, this is a great film, and its nice to see major studio's such as Warner issuing such, investment and creative control to a too often ridged and commercial industry. Christopher Noland, director of the masterful 'Momento' brings this film a dark edge. This film isn't perfect, but its miles ahead of most of the crap American studio's are pumping out these days. i can only hope that this is the start of an assent ion from this slump wave been having with originality and quality. 14/11/07: after viewing the film again it's clear this film is a bit of a mildstone. looking forward to the dark knight.",7,4,5,22 October 2005
The Elephant Man," Heartbreaking
","This film really shows off David lynch's versatility as a director, it is both heartfelt and disturbing in it's brutal cruelty. John Hurt is amazing as John Merrick, he injects so much innocence into the character, His first words on screen will absolutely melt your heart. It is a dense film, with some areas hard to sit through, but it is well worth it. It also cleverly layers themes of vanity and the concept of true beauty into the people outside Merrick's world. Hopkins is also brilliant, displaying a great deal of subtlety. The Black and White photography is beautiful and perfectly compliments the story. This is a very moving story, from a very brilliant film-maker. Recommendation: 'Bring a hankie, Masterpiece'",10,0,0,3 February 2007
I Am Legend," Mesmerising, we've seen this before....but not like this
","I am legend is one in a string of brilliant genre pieces to come out this decade, visually stunning, poetic, philosophical, together with a heart wrenching performance from Smith and a genuine curiosity into the human spirit.The story is basic, very basic. And it's Will Smith that really raises it to the level of brilliance from average. It's a very layered performance, darkly funny, haunting and isolating, Smith as usual pulls it off to a tee. The creature effects are decidedly average, it's when they can't been seen and it's dark that they do their best work.Director Francis Lawrence really bring a sensitivity back to the genre film, his stylish debut, 'Constantine' proved him to have exiting potential. One can't wait to see what the future brings.",10,1,3,4 January 2008
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Great Sequel, Get the German Version if you can
","Great sequel, though i did only watch the German extended edition i got over ebay. Extended by over 5 min's, what a difference, more gore, more consistent editing, better story flow. It continues the story from the first film and sets up brilliantly for Resident Evil: Extinction. The atmosphere is spot on, its moody, there is so much action it is almost exhausting. In either case i enjoyed the German version much better than the western cut. There is not much really left to say, only that this trilogy is going strait onto the cult shelf, its all about chicks, guns and monsters. It doesn't waste its time trying to patronize us, just simple fun with likable characters, and great lines. Pure trash fun.Recommendation: Get the German cut!!!!!",10,2,4,7 October 2007
Big Fish," Deeply moving, a wonderful celebration of eccentricity
","Tim Burton is such a rebel with his films, his imagination is so brilliant, he honestly pisses over half the Hollywood crap that comes out these days. I was initially caught up in Matrix fever the year this gem came out, and missed it. But here two years later, i slipped it into my DVD player, i experienced a beautiful movie. Edward Blooms deep naivety to his own brilliance is so brilliantly captured by Ewan Mcreggor, the cast in general are all so brilliant. This film was relatively overlooked when it came out in 2003, undeservedly. I simply can't recommend this movie enough, go out and buy it for goodness sake. A Masterpiece",10,0,1,17 December 2005
The Graduate," Comedy Classic
","Nominated for seven Academy Awards, and winner of Best Director, 'the Graduate' first and most importantly is a very funny film, with historic Career high performances from Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, it's one of those films that is just simply brilliant. The performances were naturalistic, so ahead of there time, and the storytelling is so unpredictable and unorthodox. It's gushing with black humor so subtle you might miss it if you blink. 'The Graduate' is storytelling at its best, thanks to Mike Nichols perfect direction. It really is a hard film to put a lid on, it's a film that re-invents comedy genre to this day and in some ways has not been surpassed yet. Just go see it!!",10,0,0,4 May 2007
The Fly," A psychological horror film about vanity and violation
","This was my first look at a David Cronenburg film. Impressive and similar in style to Paul Verhoevens stylistic use of explicit sex and violence. But its not the horrid make up effects that make this film special, it's its ability to take you inside the mind of these characters to a point of being uncomfortable, going inside our deep seeded obsession with vanity. Not only a horror film, but a tragic love story, The Fly melds genres like no other film i've seen. These really are some of the most disturbing notions made in any horror film i have ever seen since 'Alien'. The film is a masterpiece of psychological sickness, bound to make even the most hard core horror fan weak at the knee's.",10,1,2,7 February 2006
Eyes Wide Shut," Stanley Kubrick's last lavish journey.
","CRUISE, KIDMAN, KUBRICK a sizzle fest of some of the most successful entertainers of the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's would (not surprisingly) be taken as a publicity stunt, luckily the hype and the film are both one in success. It's brash sexuality is sure to deter some, but Kubricks craft is undeniable. Floating tracking shots, lush costumes, colours, images and performances, grace the screen in Kubricks big Arovour film.Cruise plays Dr. William Harford, who becomes ensnared in a dangerous erotic foray after his wife (kidman) admits sexual longings. Harford spends a long night on the town, plunging deeper into doubt, fear, self discovery and eventually a sexual rabbit hole.The picture is drenched in nudity, mostly unnecessary and degrading to the actors, Also the film is slightly too long, and so it loses its punch slightly by its second viewing. EYES WIDE SHUT is by no means Kubrick's best work. But it still stands on its own as a bold masterpiece.",9,2,4,12 December 2006
Inside Man," Gripping, layered and ice cold cool
","Every so often you get a rare cluster of great films. This year has proved to be an example with V for Vendetta and now, Inside Man. An intelligent and thought provoking heist thriller that bounces off your previous conceptions of the negotiator drama, in fact it uses the cliché's to it's advantage. The film also has the benefit of three strong leads (Washington, Foster and Owen) and two great supporters (Defoe, Plummer). Washington is very cool, foster plays against type with an icy performance, Owen is dark and very funny. Great direction with the glorious return of Spike Lee and judging by this film hopefully future joints. Great editing and cinematography, There's nothing more that i can say without spoiling this rare treat, go and see it now.",10,4,8,8 April 2006
The Da Vinci Code," A Thick, fat film, that one must be patient with to enjoy
","It's very rare that a film and or book this daring is released, particularly at the worlds currant state of mind numbing TV and political correctness.I have read many reviews for this film and am, happy to say that i enjoyed the movie more than the book, and what an adaption it is. Critics tend to pounce on things when generally there is a great abound of hype surrounding. I am sure there is a great amount of bias in these reviews,It flopped in Europe, surprise, surprise. and is getting rave reviews in the America's. It would depend on your preference of beliefs.Anyway back to the film, the runtime was perfect, even though i knew what was going to happen next. It is a dialogue heavy film, but it is so compelling. i think currant entertainment is dumbing down audiences, and i think with a few viewings of this film, people will see its true colours.Mckellen displays a brave and colourful portrayal of Leah Teaburg, eccentric, charismatic aristocrat/historian, passionate about the astounding revelations that the puzzle implies.The first scenes in 'code' with Mckellens character are likely the scenes that will divide audience and shock the religious, as he accounts the revelations of Mary Magdalene the sacred feminine and the holy bloodline with spite, it's potent stuff, but Mckellen is so wonderful in his characterization, undoubtedly an Oscar nod is on the horizon.What can i say about The Da Vinci Code, visually rich, a provocative film with brave performances and brilliant direction. Go and see it with an open mind, you might just have some fun, which i really think is the point at the end of the day.",9,2,9,20 May 2006
30 Days of Night," Dark, moody, stylish..IGNORE the haters
","I didn't think i could get exited by watching a vampire movie ever again. All the greats have made fine use of the mythology, Francis Ford Coppola, Neil Jordan, Steven Norrington, Guillermo Del Toro and lets not forget one of the greatest F. W. Murnau. 30 Day of Night, is a delightfully nasty horror, which has once again has wet my appetite to see those whom are fanged back on celluloid. These vampire's are just scary, no sexual innuendo, they are just plain beasts.The films Comic book origins are quite evident through the film, one of its main draw cards is that it looks beautiful, the cinematography is fabulous, the punchy electro rock score used is effectively scarce during the film, silence is the films most potent suspense weapon.The Cast is great, Josh Hartnet Putting probably the best performance of his career, but it's Ben Foster who really steals the show, I've never seen a actor possessed by their own character to that extent since Anthony Hopkins and Lector. Mellisa George is perfectly fine, i wasn't blown away, but Danny Huston was superbly Menacing, his presence in the film was foreboding.Now to the films few flaws, the amazing build up, that incorporated the mystery of what exactly was going on in the town was swiftly ripped away by full on carnage, this was a little distracting, but soon the suspense returned.I have to recommend this film, i don't really understand why people arn't liking the film. It's very old fashioned in its approach, most probably why it is so brilliant. give it a go.Recommendation: If you call yourself a horror fan, you really shouldn't dislike it",9,183,290,14 November 2007
American Gangster," Ridley Scott tackles yet another genre, and re-invents it.
","You won't find a more versatile director than Ridley Scott. Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise, Black Hawk Down, Gladiator, Hannibal, Kingdom of Heaven DC and Now American Gangster. A film that rivals Scarface for Raw Power, and Tightly wound storytelling. As for Versatility, the mans catalogue speaks for itself, each one of those films are acclaimed in their respective genre's.Densel Washington nails the role, giving us a frighting yet like-able characterization of Frank Lucas, Crowe also nails his respective role without a hitch.Not more to be said, its amazing with the subject matter how beautifully it unfolds.Recommendation: GO S E E IT N O W",10,0,3,11 January 2008
The Deer Hunter," A great film, that will leave you speechless
","Realism, is the card that this tour DE force has to play. Its bold juxtaposition of before/after is incredible and effecting. After about an hour of introduction, the wedding scene (which would seem to run too long but is the set up for the emotional conclusion) and the short hunting scene, the film jumps abruptly into Vietnam, and to one of the most powerful scenes in cinema history. The Russian Rullet sequence is possibly one of the finest pieces of acting i have ever seen, absolutely infamous. It is a very sad film, but also a beautiful one, an ode to forgotten hero's.Recommendation: bring a hankie...yes, even the guys.... Masterpiece.",10,0,0,13 December 2006
300," Visually stunning
","Changed from an R18+ to MA two weeks before its release i can see why such a rating as R would have been considered, 300 is many things, a shameless and fun blood bath, an emotional commentary on war, a commentary on currant world events, a piece of history turned into mythology and the ultimate entertainment for bored males, film geeks and fan boys.I won't lie to you, 300's premise is simple, but it is by a masterstroke that all elements come together to make cinematic magic. For starters no one else but Gerard Butler could play the role of Leonidas, secondly butler and the rest of the cast perform wonders, particularly Aussie actor David Wenham, thirdly the digital production design and cinematography have to be seen to be believed.300's is neat little bundle of Adrenaline and testosterone weaved into a two hour package. The emotional last stand of the 300 is rousing and beautiful scene.300 is a fantastic film destined to be a classic, and remembered with 'Sin City' as the cornerstone of digital film-making.Verdict: Just shut up and go see it NOW!!",8,3,9,6 April 2007
