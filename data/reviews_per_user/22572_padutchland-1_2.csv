Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Funny - but perhaps not for all viewers
","Just a few comments on the type of movie itself. You can read about the story from the many other commentaries. Please read to the end before you judge my comments. I had some younger friends of the family drag me to the movies to see this movie. They said it was the funniest they had ever seen and wanted me to see it, since I was a movie buff. OK, they are in their twenties and I am significantly older (enough said). I say this just to put my comments in perspective. Overall, I can say yes, the movie had a good number of funny scenes. However, I would hardly classify it as the funniest movie ever. Anyone who says that has not seen a broad range of comedies. Furthermore, it depends heavily on bathroom type humor (going poo-poo, etc - you get the idea), and a bit of slapstick such as Borat (Sacha Cohen) wrestling around the motel room with a naked, fat, hairy man. Were there funny skits? Sure, and I have nothing against such types of humor if, they are used sparingly to support the thought process involved in enjoying genuine comedy. However, the movie was overloaded with low brow humor. I think it was George Burns (lived to be almost 100) or some other elder statesman of comedy who said: 'anyone can be funny using bathroom humor. But if you have to depend on it, you are no comedian'. There was a scene, probably as a nod to slapstick, where Borat's friend Azamat (Ken Davitian) appears dressed as Oliver Hardy (of Laurel and Hardy fame). He tells Borat 'here's another fine mess you've gotten me into'. Borat says something about him looking like Hitler and it will escape most younger folks who have never heard of Oliver Hardy, once part of the most famous and successful slapstick comedy team in the world. We had a discussion as viewers as to whether the scenes in this movie were staged or real. Did any of these people actually think they were part of a real documentary, not a comedy movie? I honestly don't know. Some parts were obviously staged, but other parts had people on camera who would never want to be part of such a movie, due to their reputation. Were they knowingly part of it or will the company be seeing law suits from them? The scenes of Borat's home village were probably shot in Mexico, not the MidEast. My opinion of the movie is that it is a movie more for younger people (although older people trying to look hip may pretend to wow with it). Humor in the entertainment industry has been going more toward a base humor over many years. So it stands to reason that today's young people (having been less exposed to humor where one has to consider lines and skits to enjoy, versus the over exposure of reflex bathroom type humor) will find the movie funnier than those who have experienced wider types of humor over time. Today's youth is no better or worse than previous generations - give them quality entertainment and they will recognize and enjoy it. While this movie has some laughs, it is not a quality challenge to anyone's funny-bone. So - is it worth seeing? If you are easily offended, don't go. It is often the same humor formerly experienced only in night club acts. And yet, at the same time and in different ways, it offers an unusual approach to presenting humor on the screen. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder after all. Regardless of what youthful viewers are saying, I don't see it as 'the funniest thing ever'. I don't think it will become a classic of comedy. I do think it might develop a kind of cult type status such as Rocky Horror. Although I doubt it will last as long as Rocky Horror (1975). Time will tell. Borat does not have the deeper quality of a Forrest Gump or scenes of the Griswold's vacations or Caddyshack. Still, having presented the negatives the question remains, should you go see it? I'd say yes, what the heck! Go see it, as there are many funny parts to be sure. You will come away with a good number of laughs and some great quotes to quip with your friends. That is certainly worth the price of admission. Enjoy!",Null,2,6,15 November 2006
Casino Royale," A different James Bond - but wow what a show!
","I've been a fan of James Bond movies since the beginning - OK, I'm dating myself. Seeing the new James Bond in previews etc, I wasn't sure I would like it, as he does not resemble the former smooth talking, debonair 007 of the good old days. Don't expect a rehash here of what the movie was about, you will get plenty of recaps in other member commentaries. Right off the bat though, I was surprised to see 007 shoot and kill a man who was not armed, and James knew it. Former James Bonds never took out a bad guy unless he was trying to do in our hero (as unreal as that is in real spy life). The new James Bond is rougher and tougher with no holds barred. OK, you get the idea. Daniel Craig was most believable in the part and the stunt men did a wonderful job, but it looked like Craig also did a lot of hard work himself. Eva Green was perfect for her part as she was both vulnerable and yet matched James quip for quip with her own kind of toughness. Being that beautiful doesn't hurt either. The bad guys and the supporting cast were most outstanding as well. Special effects will wow you. Don't try to compare this with the 1967 Casino Royale. Same title, different movies. Don't try to compare it to other James Bond movies either. Just enjoy each for itself. I hate to give any movie two thumbs up, but that other hand is trying to raise a digit. Go see this one!",9,3,6,23 November 2006
