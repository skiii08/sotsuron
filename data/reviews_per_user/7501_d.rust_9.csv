First Man," Here's to Roger, Ed and Gus.
","I was a nut for spaceflight in the sixties. I had a model Gemini capsule, before that a model X15. I clipped missions from the newspaper. My dad sat with me as we watched Armstrong descend the ladder, live. I knew about the Westinghouse television cameras and I knew about using pure oxygen in a capsule.It's not an historical document. It's not even close. Sure, there are some visual elements and snippets of dialogue that mimic the facts, but it is, after all a movie for entertainment.I was entertained. But it was like watching a movie you had already seen. There is no drama. When the date (January 27) showed up I knew what was going to happen.There are no surprises.",9,2,3,30 April 2019
Aquaman," Are you that Fish-Boy?
","I wasn't a great fan back in the sixties. Not like I was for the rest of DC pantheon. The TV cartoon was part of the Superman Hour (with that guitar dahh-ranggg! sound effect). On the Big Bang Theory, poor Raj was left being Aquaman because everyone else had their hero choice first. The character was a real #luser when it came to popularity. Then came Justice League.'I hear you can talk to fish.'Everything changed. HOLEY UNDERWEAR! It turns out that Aquaman is a BAD ASS!This movie delivers on all points. Aquaman is human, not just some strange Prince Namor Submariner. He likes drinking beer, partying with tough guys, getting tattoos and hangs with his dad. He cracks wise while he cracks heads. He's intensely loyal. And he's very powerful.Visually, it's brilliant with incredible action scenes. Patrick Wilson plays an arrogant leader who rules the Kingdom of Atlantis and has a plan to unite the Undersea against the surface dwellers. Amber Heard is the beautiful daughter of an allied Kingdom. Temuera Morrison and Nicole Kidman play Arthur Curry's parents. Willem Dafoe, Dolph Lundgren round out a name cast lead by Jason Momoa. And yes, CGI is used. And the CGI is extremely effective. It gives a dreamlike appearance to underwater sequences which would be impossible to do as practical effects.The story is top notch: it follows a path that at times makes effective use of flashbacks while advancing the plot. It's very satisfying and concludes heroically. Yes, it's a fairy tale ending, but what did you expect? IT'S A COMIC BOOK-SUPERHERO MOVIE!",10,1,3,26 March 2019
Begin Again," The Magic is in the Music
","I was changing channels, there was nothing playing on the other station. So I literally had no idea what I was getting into, or what I had missed.Oh look, it's Mark Ruffalo ordering some bourbon in a bar. He doesn't even care what label. He looks like he doesn't care when he last changed his underwear. His ears perk up as a pretty singer begins her song. He's immediately rapt while he drunkenly stands before her, waving arms about. We hear what he hears: a violin plays, drums come in, a guitar plays while she sings. Now he has a reason in his being, he is inspired.After her song is finished, they converse a while. It turns out he's a disgraced A&R producer who has hit bottom and he wants to bring her music to life. She's naturally skeptical, but he manages to convince her. And in a moment of clarity, he tells her of his idea of how to bring this about.There is a kind of sadness in this movie, where everyone has had their rock-bottom moment, but participation in the project lifts everyone to a new level. The music is heart-felt. The performances by the cast are right on and enjoyable. Here's hoping you enjoy this as much as I did.",9,1,1,3 April 2018
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," I've got a cool theme song
","Look out! Here's comes the Spider-man!I've been waiting since 1967 for something like this, when Spidey's Toronto-based cartoon came out. For me, it just sounded like home --because it was!I was so pleasantly surprised; I enjoyed 'Spider-verse' immensely: Jake Johnson, Chris Pine, Nick Cage, Liev Schreiber, Hailey Steinfeld and of course, Shameik Moore were all outstanding in their roles.The animators (180!) finally got over the fake look of modern movement which pervades other films. It looks so natural. Yeah, you know what I'm talking about: the uncanny valley. You see it in Pixar films, you see it in Brad Bird's films. They get close, 'Spider-verse' gets spot on.You'll enjoy this film.He's got radioactive blood!",8,1,2,28 March 2019
Before Sunset," Were you there in Vienna?
","The action scenes were astounding! Bullets fly everywhere as Jesse tries to get Celine to her apartment before he must leave to catch his flight back to the US! Celine's grandmother died exactly six months after they last saw each other and there must have been *some* reason. Jean Reno plays a key role as their driver, Phillippe.Oh wait. That never happened. Jean Reno isn't in this film.There is talk of a gun, yes. But no bullets were fired. And yes, Celine's grandmother died six months (less a day) in 1995. And yes, Jesse has to catch his plane. And yes, she has an apartment.But it is a leisurely walk they take through Paris as they effortlessly converse as though they have known each other for a decade. Life has gone on for the both of them. Or did it really stop for them? Are they trapped in the moment after a passionate kiss, a promise at the entrance to a train coach, a declaration of love? Can they pick it up again? Is there time enough?Is love waiting? Is the city of Light also a city of Love?You'll have to see the movie to find out. Be sure to wear Kevlar.",10,0,1,30 March 2019
1917," Carlos Dooley comes to the big screen
","Don't get me wrong, I love films that exhibit long continuous shots, like Birdman, or Touch of Evil or Hitchock's Rope. Even that Goodfellas tracking shot through the club is fascinating from a technical level.Unfortunately, 1917 - although ambitious on many levels is simply not much more than a VideoGame first person shooter run through.It's exhausting watching this effort to carry out a mission, but it fails to really give us substance.Sorry, kids. Only 5 out of 10.",5,7,19,19 January 2020
The Disaster Artist," Everyone who has really lived has had a friend like Tommy Wiseau
","No, I haven't seen <a href='/title/tt0368226/'>The Room (2003)</a>.But I know the director. Not personally, but I know who he his. I've met many of his clones. Some of them are effective duplicates, some just passing similarities.THE DISASTER ARTIST tells the story of a friendship between a young man at the start of his career and a very strange individual who claims to have roots in New Orleans, with a strange way of speaking and a fixation on having talent, despite evidence to the contrary.Greg and Tommy wind up making what many have called the worst movie of the 21st century. Dave Franco plays a heartfelt grounded Sestero, while his brother, a sometime actor by name of James, plays the other-worldly Wiseau.So, whether your version of Tommy is called Zkot Pen, or Ellesar Tetramariner or 'Virgo', your journey through life has crossed paths with him before.Enjoyable for the bizarre characterisation.",Null,0,0,31 March 2018
Black Panther," Egotastic Funtime! NOT
","Crapfest from the first glimmer to the last fade to black, this is a movie you would be proud to throw on the barbecue just to see it melt and dissolve into a gluey mess -- much like its plot, its dialogue and its acting.Back in the late 60s, Black Panther was great. By the time this rolled out of the monstrosity that has become Disney, it turned into a racist mashup of political correctness that relied too heavily on fake 'african' accents, fake 'Afrikaans' accents and thug life posing by Killmonger. Back in the those long-gone decades, Panther was a bad ass. This movie shows him as being weak and unworthy of wearing the Claw Necklace.Hopefully, the film will go the way of the LAST Fantastic 4: forgotten and stillborn.One positive note, the special effects were on the money. The rest of it was unfortunate. I gave it a five just in case you thought I was going trash it.",5,0,0,7 August 2018
Before Sunrise," The Cow can smoke a Cigarette
","Here's proof that you don't need automobiles blowing up or people being ordered into trains or hellfire raining down to have a great movie.Linklater does a fine job of putting this movie together. He got the right people and the right locations. He got the situations and the eventual closeness of his couple right.They hit it off. Their chemistry was perfect. Awkward silences and unabashed laughter. It was unacknowledged love-at-first-sight.Have you walked the streets? Have you seen the people and talked to them? Have you looked at your new-found lover and just known they were as lost in love as you? Did you kiss?At first you count the days. Then you miss a day. And another. Then you realize too late, you can't make it. You won't. You missed. You lost.",10,1,2,29 March 2019
