Casablanca," AS Time Goes By...
","As time goes by, this movie gets better and better. No matter how many times I see this movie, it never gets old. The love story lasts a lifetime as well as the action and suspense. The chemistry between Ingrid Bergman and Humphrey Bogart is incomparable. Bogart's portrayal of Rick is one of the greatest acting roles I have ever witnessed. To see a character so stoic and unemotional and then to know that a single woman is able to break him down to nothing is so groundbreaking to the mind. Beside the amazing acting, my other favorite aspect of this movie is the lighting. The lighting on this set of this movie was so moving, that it was hard to tell that they were trying to tell the emotional and romantic story with just the lighting. For example, the brighter lighting was reserved for when we saw Rick and Isla in France when they were happy and in love. The darker lighting was reserved for when Rick is alone without Isla and especially when he was alone and drinking the night she came back into his life. The lighting also told Rick's mental state as well. Such an amazing movie and deserving of every award given to it.",Null,1,2,5 March 2011
Citizen Kane," My First Welles Movie
","I had never seen a Orson Welles movies before I had seen 'Citizen Kane.' I had heard so much about the movie, I had very high hopes for it, as everyone I talked to said it was a magnificent movie. 'Citizen Kane' tells the story of Charle Foster Kane and his life through flashbacks, as the title character died in the very beginning of the film. The entire movie is an investigative journey through Kane's life trying to figure out what 'Rosebud' means, the last word the man uttered. Welles charted into unknown territory with 'Citizen Kane.' He told the story through flashbacks, something that has never been done before, on account of not wanting to confuse the audience and therefore loose ticket sales. This was a very risky move that Welles made in 1941, however it proved to profitable since many movies since have used the flashback sequence to tell their stories.",Null,0,1,8 May 2011
Taxi Driver," A Very Young Robert DiNero
","No matter how many movies I see Robert DiNero in, I am always left speechless at his performance. I can't remember the first movie I saw him in, but I had never seen this movie. Of course, I had seen that one famous seen - the 'you talking' to me' scene. It has been spoofed and made of in countless films and TV shows, so when I knew I was going to watch it in it's seriousness, I wasn't sure how I was going to feel. Of course, there was no comedic acting in this scene. It was quite terrifying, in the sense that Robert DiNero made me believe he was truly dangerous and psychotic. The fact that this movie came out in 1976 was very important to the context of the movie. People were angry at the government, they became anti-establishment and very vocal about their concerns and this movie gave the people a spokesperson in Bickle.",Null,2,4,6 May 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," The Grapes of Wrath
","'The Grapes of Wrath' is a 1940 adaptation of John Steinbeck's classic novel of the same name. It tells the story of the Joad family trying to make their to California while trying to survive the harsh conditions of the Great Depression. The movie was very political in the sense that it made many references to left sided politics, especially when the preacher, Jim Casey, mentions that he is turning to Communism. Because of this, the movie received a little negative criticism. The movie won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress and Best Directer, as well as nominated for Best Actor, Best Film Editing, Best Picture, Best Sound Recording, and Best Adapted Screenplay.",Null,0,0,8 May 2011
The Exorcist," Terrifying
","What is truly terrifying about this movie is not the effects of the pea soup, or the make-up of Linda Blair, but the unknown. What the person doesn't know will terrify them. In this movie, the characters do not know what is haunting them, and therefore make it more difficult for them to fight it. Amazing acting from 10 year old Linda Blair. The act of possession alone is terrifying, but to hear an innocent 10 year old girl swear and curse they way she did as well as speak and use the cross the way she did was much more terrifying than any effect or make-up. After watching other horror movies, this movie did not scare me as much in effects, especially the scene were Reagan's head spun all the way around. Because I live in a world where any special effect is perfect and flawless, it did not affect me as it did with the people viewing it in the theaters for the first time. Extremely haunting movie.",Null,2,3,6 May 2011
The Graduate," Dustin Hoffman - His First, His Best
","The melancholy, indifferent, and uninterested spirit of the college graduate in the 1960's is portrayed perfectly by Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman plays Benjamin, the college graduate who is not sure what to do with the rest of his life and falls into an affair with a married woman, his neighbor Mrs. Robinson. Benjamin goes on to accidentally falling love with Mrs. Robinson's daughter, Elaine. Their relationship proves to be difficult with Mrs. Robinson still in the picture. What strikes me the most in this movies, besides the acting of Dustin Hoffman and Anne Bancroft, is the use of dark colors versus lights colors, mostly black and white. Black and white is used to show the difference between young and old as well as innocent and guilty. Dark colors on Mrs. Robinson show her as a predator. Benjamin's head in the beginning is in a white background, while it is shown in a black background after he has had sex with Mrs. Robinson. Colors, symbolism, and acting make this movie amazing, especially for the time period.",Null,0,0,6 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Stunning
","What struck me the most about the movie was both the music and the costumes. 'Singin' in the Rain' tells the story of Don, Kathy and their friend Cosmo during the time that Hollywood pictures were beginning to talk, and therefore beginning to sing. I am a lover of musicals, yet I had never seen this one before. I was amazed by the colors of the costumes as well as the musical numbers and the choreography that went with them. Gene Kelly amazed me at his dancing abilities, as I had never seen any man dance like that before and Debbie Reynolds, who I learned was not a dancer, but in fact a gymnast and learned all her dancing on the set. In a age where the only place one can seem to see a musical is on a Broadway, or off Broadway, production, it was refreshing to see a musical as a movie with amazing sound and color.",Null,1,2,7 May 2011
Psycho," Afraid to Shower
","I have seen 'Psycho' many times, and each time I am terrified by both the shower scene and the stairs seen. 'Psycho' tells the story of Marion Crane staying at the Bate's Motel and her Motel owner. Strange things start to happen and the audience as well as Marion become horrified as to what is going on. Hitchcock's genius comes from the sound effects and music , I discovered. Camera angles bring fear to the audience as well. The scene where Hitchcock delivers an ariel shot of Norman Bates coming out of the bedroom with the infamous 'Psycho' soundtrack playing is extremely frighting because of the suddenness with witch it happened. What I had noticed in multiple viewings is that the movie is hardly as scary without the sound, hence Hitchcock's masterful use os sound effects and camera.",Null,0,0,7 May 2011
The Wizard of Oz," Keeps Getting Better and Better
","We can't seem to remember the first time we saw 'The Wizard of Oz.' We just seem to have always known what it was, how the songs go, and each and every character. Whenever we think of the musical genre for movies, some of us automatically think of 'The Wizard of Oz.' This has been one of my favorite movies since I can remember, and every time I watch it, it keeps getting better and better than the last time I watched it. Although the storyline, characters and costumes are all well developed and elaborate, the best parts of this movie was always the music and the effects. I was always blown away from the switch to old time sepia to full blown bright and bold colors. The music and sounds are the key point to the movie. Music is what keeps audience involved and wins hearts as well as the sound effects that drag the audience even deeper into the movie and creating a even stronger relationship with the movie.",9,3,4,16 February 2011
