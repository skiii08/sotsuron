Casablanca," Review for History of Cinema
","'Casablanca' was a total surprise to me. I have heard that it was a great film, even one of the best. I now agree, it is fantastic. The cinematography and lighting are what make this such an amazing and intriguing movie. It was beautiful to watch. quite an artful presentation allows the audience to really get a feel for the characters struggles and triumphs. the art form adds an aspect to the film that modern movies just don't have. i don't believe another will ever hold such an high quality feel as 'Casablanca' has. Of course the story, plot, and characters are also very well done, but in my opinion it is the presentation of everything that really grabs your attention. i'm sure this film was substantially more powerful at the time it was released during the war, but today one can still feel the struggles of the time period in this movie. i really enjoyed all the humor that is tucked in to such a serious subject it takes the edge off.",9,1,2,5 March 2011
The Grapes of Wrath," Review for History of Cinema
","I have been watching many old black and white movies for my history of cinema class and have enjoyed them all. So i did also enjoy 'The Grapes of Wrath' but i was much less intrigued. I liked the story and the plot and do think all other aspects of the film were good. It was a bit dull at times and seemed to drag on in places. i did completely feel for the Joad family throughout the movie and was always rooting for them to find some sort of employment. I understand that the film is meant to show the struggles of families in the midwest during the depression and it certainly did a good job getting that point across.I perked up at the very end when Tom told his mother that he was going to try and do something about the land and attempt to gather protester's, which would have given the movie a bit more action or just a specific direction. But that is probably because I am so accustomed to modern day movies jam packed with non stop action.",7,0,0,7 April 2011
The Graduate," Review for History of Cinema
","I thought this was a very interesting film. the story allows for the new Hollywood style to make a stand, pushing limits that are rarely touched like nudity, a man and a woman in the same bed, even naked together. And then of course an older married woman sleeping with a much younger boy. these happenings were done, i believe, to showcase the potential that future movies have, the lines that can now be crossed and turned into something great. Furthermore i think the film is trying to show young people a few things about life. showing firsthand the ups and downs of a relationship with an older person. another i think is that one should not rush into marriage at such a young age because, as you see in both Ben and Elaine's faces as they ride away on the bus, they have no idea what to do and how they will do it.Its a great movie that is funny and smart while teaching valuable lessons.",9,1,1,11 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Review for History of Cinema
","This was the first time i have seen 'Singin' in the Rain' and I seriously enjoyed the movie. the story was engaging and keeps you interested, but its the dancing that really held my attention. every dance scene was incredible. my favorite was definitely Cosmo Brown's dance solo. It was extremely funny while visually entertaining and show cases how acrobatic he is. I noticed that a lot of his comedic dance moves are quite similar to moves in modern break dancing. At one point he runs up a wall about six feet and back flips off, it was insane. I also of course enjoyed the famous singin' in the rain solo song and dance by Don Lockwood. I actually want to go jump in puddles this summer because of that scene. Great movie and i plan on watching it again sometime.",8,0,1,1 April 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Review for History of Cinema
","i highly enjoyed watching this movie. Jack Nicholson played his character superbly. \I am still uncertain if i think R.P. McMurphy was actually crazy or not. I kind of think he really was faking it the whole time because life was easier in a mental hospital and so was a chance at escape, which he tried a few times. I think the point of the movie is to show that mental patients are not totally incompetent and do not need to be forced into a strict routine. You see in the movie that with a little change in routine, a little excitement, even the patients that are most out of it become more alive and personable. still, it is also shown that too much freedom turns to chaos.This was a great movie with great acting and a powerful message.",9,0,2,13 May 2011
