Lucky Number Slevin," Mediocre
","I saw this movie last night with two friends. One hated it and the other deemed it 'just okay.' Unfortunately, my opinion of 'Lucky Number Slevin' is not much more esteemed.Personally, I found the entire first hour to be a snooze fest; a bore that is plagued by, as my friend said, 'cheesy turns of phrase and plays on words.' Loved the comment one user made about how the dialogue in this movie is comparable to that in 'Gilmore Girls.' The script is cringe-worthy, which for me, was enough alone to dislike this movie.However, I will give kudos to the actors. They did the best they could with such boring, one-dimensional characters. I feel the only people who changed at all by movie's end were Freeman and Kingsley--and they end up dead! That's also assuming their characters learned the error of their ways right before Slevin kills them, and even that assumption is probably a stretch.This A-list cast was wasted. I felt no emotion toward anyone involved and was relieved when the movie finally reached its only somewhat unexpected conclusion.I give this movie three out of ten stars, for a script that is borderline insulting and for a typical, not-so-memorable-or-exciting story of revenge.To its credit, it is mildly entertaining and worth at least some of your time and money. We saw it at the dollar theater last night, if that says anything.",3,78,165,26 May 2006
