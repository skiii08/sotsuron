Conquest 1453," Lame Movie
","I watched the first and the last 45 minutes of the movie and frankly I was so bored of the acting and the historical inaccuracies. UlubatlÄ± Hasan never existed, it was invented by Turkish nationalist and this is a well known fact but we see him in the movie as a hero. After conquering Constantinople, Mehmed II. let his janissary's plunder the city for two days. Because of having lost a lot of soldiers and as a custom, he condone the violations. I know that there is no point in mentioning the real historical facts but I was expecting something better. So much money spent on a lousy movie as this one. A real genius like Sultan Mehmed II., should have been reflected in a better way considering the historical facts.",2,3,7,2 February 2013
