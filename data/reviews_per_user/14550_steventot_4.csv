Sucker Punch," Disappointment in every way
","I don't know why people rate this movie so high. I would say its damn the worst movie I saw this year. Wouldn't spend a penny if I would knew how bad this can be. Maybe the movie itself is trying to be somewhat original or complicated but in the end its too bad. I want my time back i spent watching this trash. For some people it might be entertaining to watch those CGI effects , which i clearly don't seem to understand why the heck are those there ? This movie has nothing to do with action , horror or mystery. Nor i can call it SCI-FI . Its a strange mixed up movie , very mixed up and very strange. It doesn't fit my taste at all...I don't enjoy messed up movies. I would rate it very bad , the acting , the plain plot and the stupid style of presentation. 1/10 for me...very bad and i am very disappointed. Was expecting more ,the only watchable parts are in the trailer....",1,19,41,5 April 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Very boring movie....
","Well what can i say... When i went to watch this movie in the cinema i was excited. The start is great.But then the peace slows down and the movie turns into boring and frustrating hybrid. Yes there are good scenes which are even funny (well considered the brutality,not always ). But then again there are very few and very rare moments which deserve higher rating. This movie is a hit & miss. Some people will comment positive just because they like Tarantino. But for others who seek a good movie,this just isn't it!I don't really like the way the movie tries to tell you a story which just isn't there.The plot is plain and very few actors took it seriously it seems.The movie isn't the worst but nothing special and for me it was just a waste of time...4/10",4,6,12,15 December 2009
Rush," Astonishing piece of cinematography
","This is the movie I have been waiting this year. After having a chance to watch it , I must say that this movie is a true masterpiece. Not only for the great work with effects or the great directing , but the brilliant performance of both main actors and the emotional feel the movie pushes to the audience. If you looking for a movie with 'soul' and 'passion' this is the one you have been looking for. This movie is not just about racing , it is as much about life itself and carries on great weight about decision we make during our lifetime. Some of those might have big weight on our future. Brilliant movie and one of the best movies of this year (2013) if not the best. 'RUSH' got it all ! Now go and watch it yourself !",10,2,3,20 December 2013
Trouble with the Curve," Just brilliant Eastwood
","WOW! I'm not the one who writes lot's of reviews on movies but this one is just great. Really mature motion picture with sense of humor,some drama and lots of good lines. Loved it. If you are tired of 'WOW effects' and 'Good guys always win' style of movies this one is really good fun. Eastwood brings his very good acting and the rest of the actors are very believable too. Amy Adams is very convincing at playing the worrying daughter . At the end the pace is a bit too fast, and ideally the movie could take another 30~45 minutes but that would made it longer to sit through in the theater's for some people. It still kept me entertained during the course of the movie! Recommended!",9,3,7,7 December 2012
