Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Star Wars: An Incredible Beginning
","When I was a small kid, I used to wonder what the Star Wars universe was all about. Imperial soldiers, droids, flying spaceships and starfighters, Jedi Knights, Darth Vader, etc. I was curious with all of these stuff but when I watched all the three Star Wars movies, I began to understand what George Lucas, the creator of the popular sci-fi saga itself, was trying to accomplish: explore the awe and wonders of our ever expanding universe. And now, 22 years after the release of the first movie, George Lucas and his entire crew at Lucasfilm bring the most anticipated movie of 1999, Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. I am truly impressed with this incredible film despite its noticeable flaws. The evil Trade Federation has stopped all shipping to the peaceful planet of Naboo. To resolve that matter, the Galactic Republic decides to dispatch the two Jedi Knights, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Qui-Gon Jinn to the Trade Federation Battleship to arrange a negotiation with the Neimodians. Unfortunately for our heroes, the negotiation never takes place and so they fight face-to-face with thousands of battle droids, escape to Naboo, and there they meet the annoying yet kind-hearted Gungan, Jar Jar Binks as well as the beautiful Queen Amidala (ok, I know some of you out there complaint about her make-up).  Later, our heroes meet Anakin Skywalker, a mysterious boy who is believed to bring the Balance to the Force. In my opinion, Anakin is such a cool person because he is a great podracer who never wins a single match until his recent confrontation with rival Sebulba (he is going to fly a Naboo starfighter too during the battle of Naboo. Bravo to Jake Lloyd!). You need to see the rest of the film if you haven't watched one yet. Episode I: The Phantom Menace is a very enjoyable movie that may even attract those who are not widely known to the Star Wars universe. I especially like the locations on some planets (the Naboo Palace and the wondrous city of Coruscant) as well as its awesome special effects. To heighten up the action, Darth Maul makes an incredible performance during the climatic battle with the Jedi Knights. However, I never say that The Phantom Menace is a 100% perfect movie. The storyline is pretty weak  (gee, I wonder what George Lucas is thinking) and some characters aren't well developed.  Still, this IS just only the beginning, and perhaps there will be a major improvement by the time Episode II is released.",10,67,106,9 March 2001
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," A Pretty Straightforward Movie
","And I really mean it! I have absolutely no idea how this pirate movie manages to enter the IMDb's Top 250 Movie List, but I guess most of you viewers love The Curse of the Black Pearl for some good reasons. However, I don't find it entirely revolutionizing in any sense. First of all, the plot's simply too straightforward in my taste (the script is pretty cheesy and tiring as well) and like any typical Hollywood movies, expect lots of the same old swashbuckling stuff and highlighted special effects without being mesmerized by its overall b-movie context. Aside of these criticisms, Johnny Depp is brilliant as the goofy Jack Sparrow but the rest of the cast is just plain OK. The Curse of the Black Pearl seems to be a no-brainer and doesn't hold my interest any longer now. If you want a quality pirate (or ship) movie, I highly recommend you to watch 'Master and Commander: The Far Side Of The World' instead. It's far better than this dire action movie, for my sake.",7,1,2,14 October 2004
The Mummy," One heck of a ride!
","I have seen lots of action adventure movies ever since I was a little brat. Some are very exciting while others are plain dumb or boring. The Mummy is one of the movies that surpass my expectations and yes, it's really, really fun to watch despite its corny script (hey, all action movies tend to have CORNY dialogues, no doubt). In fact, The Mummy is based on a 1932 movie of the same name. While the original movie is slow and horrifying at its best, this latest incarnation has lots of cool sequences that cause our jaws to drop in amazement. Wow, as I have said a million times, WOW! I mean that it's an AWESOME movie that even make Indiana Jones proud. As I watch it from the beginning to the end of the film, I'm truly speechless.The movie takes in 1923 where several archaeologists stumble upon Imhotep's tomb in Hamunaptra. When the dead priest is finally brought back to life (thanks to Miss Evelyn Carnahan who is obviously curious about the Book of the Living), things get really destructive as Imhotep unleashes incredible powers that would destroy the entire world. So, it is up to our heroic Rick O'Connell to end this madness once and for all.If you wonder what makes the movie enjoyable, there are two reasons: interesting characters and special effects. Brendan Fraser and Rachel Weisz make a perfect couple while the maniacal Beni Gabor (Kevin J. O'Connor) is best suited as a spoilt jester. The rest of the cast members are also truly exceptional especially Oded Fehr as Ardeth Bay. And now for the special effects: they are truly unbelievable, from the falling meteors sequences and hair-raising escape from the sandstorm to a grand showdown with Imhotep, you will not going to miss this one out.If you are satisfied with the first movie, perhaps you want to watch the even more fantastic sequel, the Mummy Returns (I really need to watch this one too!!).",9,0,0,20 July 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the finest movies of the 21st Century
","The first chapter of the Lord of the Rings trilogy based on J.R.R Tolkien's classic novels is definitely one of those grand epics that enthralls, captivates, and even touches the hearts of the audiences around the world and Peter Jackson has done a magnificent job on bringing the Fellowship of the Ring (FOTR) back to life. I actually had gotten the chance to attend the premiere of the movie in Malaysia yesterday, thinking that it would perform like Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. Unlike anything I'd thought, FOTR's storyline is more charming, darker and sometimes even more mind-blowing than Harry Potter is. Unlike the recent summer hit movies, FOTR is one of the intelligent big-budget movies that really make you think and reconsider inside your mind.The One Ring, forged by the evil Dark Lord Sauron, is a tiny, precious yet dangerous item that can unleash terrible powers under the one who bears it. The wearer of the Ring will become corrupted and ultimately face fateful consequences. One of its victims is Isildur who defeated Sauron and took the ring to possess incredible powers, only to die in the hands of his enemy. Turn by turn will the ring be possessed by the new owners, finally obtained by an unlikely protagonist, Frodo Baggins (brilliantly played by Elijah Wood) from his Uncle Bilbo. Sensing the awful upcoming of the dark forces upon Middle-Earth, Gandalf the Grey tells everything about the ring to Frodo, suggesting that it can only be destroyed by throwing it into the volcanic Mount of Doom, but their journey won't be as simple as they've thought. Accompanying with our two heroes are Frodo's cheerful friends, Merry, Pippin and Sam as well as physical warriors from different tribes; Legolas the elf, Gimli the dwarf, Aragorn the Strider and Boromir, a Man who wishes to use the ring personally to revive his long-dead kingdom.From the enchanting prologue and nail-biting battle scenes to an emotional ending that will lead to the events of The Two Towers, Fellowship of the Ring has all the right ingredients. Every single detail of the plot is highlighted and brilliantly executed. The fictional characters too are wonderfully portrayed by well-cast actors, both truly convincing and at the same time memorable. One of my favorite characters is Gandalf the Grey (played by Sir Ian McKellen) a friend of both Bilbo and Frodo Baggins who is also one of the powerful wizards led by his leader, the evil Saruman the White. Medieval sweeping scores contributes to enhance the already legendary story, turning FOTR into a movie of many expressions'.Once again, the Fellowship of the Ring is wonderfully adapted from the original novel, thanks to Peter Jackson's brilliant direction. Despite slight alterations and some missing characters (like the ever cheerful Tom Bombadil), that won't even hinder FOTR from becoming one of the finest masterpieces of the 21st Century!",10,0,0,21 December 2001
The Matrix Revolutions," A Crowning Achievement
","I fully understand that many critics and Matrix fans alike are disappointed by the outcome and quality of The Matrix Revolutions, the final chapter of the Matrix Trilogy. But while they just simply dismiss as a mindless, CGI action-packed thriller, what they don't know is that every weakness has a strength of its own and beyond. The Matrix Revolutions may be the weakest of the series, but it is also provides the most appealing, exhilarating, spiritual and energetic ride I've ever experienced. Also, Revolutions also has the most realistic uses of CGI ever created and the SFX guys really manage to pull this off (I always thought Revolutions would have snatched an Oscar instead of Return of the King. Due to bad press, it never came to fruition).Where many see it as a failure, I see Revolutions as a worthy conclusion to the series. The main reason is that Revolutions is just a fragment of a bigger puzzle. The whole three movies connect and heavily rely on each other since each cannot qualify itself as a contender alone (The first Matrix is an exception but the Wachowski Bros. want to represent each with a theme: Birth, Life and Death, so I abide by it). The first Matrix is merely an introduction, infusing many philosophical 'techno-babbles' while witnessing the bizarre yet subtle effects of the Matrix. Reloaded is a mere extension of the first but with more surprises, balancing its weight between action sequences and mind-bending thoughts. It also serves as act two as the machines impatiently begin to dig down into the cities of Zion. Finally, Revolutions is act three: a grand finale as the Wachowski Bros. demonstrate the outcome of the first two, resulting in massacre and total destruction between the two races while all shrink into a final confrontation. All seem to blend nicely in the entire trilogy, assembled and paced in order like an orchestra. I also suggest to watch the Animatrix DVD, starting off with the two parter The Second Renaissance (you will soon learn the brilliance of the Brothers' storytelling technique).Despite poor script and wooden acting (at least the actors have tried their best), it doesn't really matter. By the time you jack in, The Matrix Saga feels like a wild dream and ends with a bang as we begin to jack out, feeling satisfied with its final premise. I also hope that those who hate Revolutions will reconsider by watching the entire saga again.",10,0,1,14 October 2004
Spirited Away," A Movie Where Many Childhood Dreams Are Reborn...
","It is so ironically tragic that many great movies such as Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away are often overlooked by the public, suggesting that commercialism is the way of reflecting the possibility of achieving blockbuster status in the box-office, even as if most of these recycled products receive poor reviews (remember Shark Tale? It's horribly cliché but millions of viewers still watch it). Is it because of technology that drives its influence to the public without providing any necessity that is its substance? Or is it because Spirited Away is considered another ordinary 2D cartoon that should be suitable for little children and not the rest of us? Sadly, this is reality and we all see as it is right now (providing that we live in a topsy-turvy world with unfair paradoxes) but it doesn't mean that Miyazaki's masterpiece has a chance to change our reflections on life. In fact, there are doses of good reasons on why this movie is so special to us, aside from its family-friendly context.Hayao Miyazaki, who has directed many of the most acclaimed animated movies in animation history (under the banner of Studio Ghibli), has stated that Spirited Away is 'for the people who used to be ten years old and the people who are going to be ten years old'. Perhaps, he really knows how children see things in their own eyes, as he might use to face during his childhood times (that's why most of his movies feature flying ships/creatures, tons of imaginative elements derived from Asian/Western cultures, some preferences from classic fairy tales, etc.) Most importantly, Mr. Miyazaki uses this tagline as an essential plot device to show the innocence, the bizarre, the horror and the wondrous revelation that the main protagonist (Chihiro) sees, feels and experiences throughout her spiritual journey, a path that we all had crossed as children before the madness of the world overwhelms our innocence. Fortunately, movies like Spirited Away succeeds in regaining our former consciousness, pulling us into his imaginative world where our childhood memories have never died; they are merely hidden inside our hearts and Mr. Miyazaki is enable to reshape them with everything this movie has to offer.Instead of the cliché-ridden plots that mar state-of-the-art-animated films of today, Mr. Miyazaki refers to his personal experience in Japan as another plot device while maintaining the classic storytelling technique to create an entirely refreshing concept based on real-life situations. If you think Spirited Away features some of the most incomprehensibly bizarre characters you've never seen, fear not! Like all good movies, despite their oddity, they all are no different from us in terms of how they adapt to life and their functions to keep the company going. That also leads to the fact that Spirited Away is really not a good vs. evil show (like Star Wars); despite its scary images, powerful spells and evil-looking monsters, they are all surprisingly ordinary with mere characteristics of maids, bosses and customers. So don't expect a Darth Vader-like antagonist to cover the whole world with darkness while unleashing a large army of robotic troopers to destroy everything in their sights.The overall animation is simply breathtaking. Even as they are all hand-drawn, the characters' expressions and body postures are all wonderfully done in a very natural way, the same applies to these beautiful background settings painted painstakingly by some of Ghibli's most talented artists in Japan. Speaking of animation, when watching it up close and personal, it does bear some resemblance to Disney's Snow White as well as his classic movies (unlike the new, recycled Disney movies of the early 2000s) in terms of its cel-shaded look and the way most characters move and interact (strangely, though, Mr. Miyazaki is not a big fan of Disney. Ironically, Disney is the only company that understands his movies' significance to moviegoers around the world, so it serves as a distributor to Ghibli's animated movies in North America.). Unlike most current anime that requires CGI to excite the audience, Mr. Miyazaki fortunately decides not to rely much on fancy digital applications (there are some subtle CGI effects, which are cleverly implemented on certain parts of the movie).Disney, in its other matter, has done a good job in translating the movie's original Japanese context to its English counterpart without radically changing the flow and theme of its entire story, thanks to Pixar animator and executive producer John Lasseter (however, Disney's marketing power fails to attract more moviegoers). Despite the audience's varied reactions on English and Japanese tracks, in my opinion, I find both of them outstanding and seem to have a natural pattern to influence the mood of the movie. Once again, Joe Hisashi, the composer of many of Miyazaki's movies, has provided some of the finest and most memorable cues ever to bring grace to the screens (one of my personal favorite is a cue in which Haku finally remembers his original name, shedding its scales in the sky). Without these important audio elements, Spirited Away could have been another uninspiring, lifeless show.It is no doubt that Spirited Away has indeed changed the way we look at animated movies, similar to the way the original Star Wars trilogy, the first two Godfather movies and films by Steven Spielberg did. It is also true that whatever I write in this review, a single picture tells a thousand words; you still need to watch it with your own eyes, feel it as you are still a child and you will understand a thousand reasons why this movie should receive an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. However, like many artistic filmmakers, Mr. Miyazaki is not interested in such glamorous spotlights and moneymaking propaganda, as he continues to inspire newer generations with his latest waves of masterpieces, starting with Howl's Moving Castle.Thank you, Mr. Miyazaki for proving once again that childhood memories will forever endure within our hearts and souls until the end of time.",10,25,45,3 May 2005
X-Men: The Last Stand," Truly X-ceptional
","I've always have been a fan of the X-Men stuff (though not a fanatical comic collector but rather a big kid who was and still is an avid fan of the cartoon show) because of the diversity of its characters, mature storytelling and the sophisticated themes of discrimination and relationships between humans and mutants. I've also recently collected the first two chapters of the X-Men DVD movies (both directed by Bryan Singer) and really enjoyed seeing how Bryan tackles them by implementing some new and clever ideas and taking necessary liberties while maintaining the spirit of the comic books. Now that Bryan's gone to help out the Superman franchise, it's up to Brett Ratner and some of his new crew to complete the final act of the symphony, which definitely seems a little frightening a first, since it usually has a higher chance of changing the mood and the quality of the show entirely. Even recently mixed receptions strengthen its case, so I honestly don't know if X3 would worth a ticket price, so I just hope in with my mom and just try to enjoy.Believe it or not, X-Men 3: The Last Stand, no matter what many critics say, turns out to be a really awesome movie! From the prologue that takes place 20 years ago to a grand climatic battle, the movie succeeds in fulfilling the promises of the first two while extending the trilogy's capability to the fullest. Though Brett could have polished the flow of the story (the sub-plots seem incoherent and cluttered), he really nails it by creating many of the most memorable and emotional pivotal scenes that even the great Bryan can't seem to muster. And if you think all of the emotions have been replaced by special effects and explosions, the critics must have been blind. Indeed, some of the characters DO SHOW THEM IN IMPORTANT CIRCUMSTANCES, even if it's mildly executed! SFX does not only make eye-candy visuals, instead, it helps to strengthen the emotions they express through their powers while at the same time creates metaphors to allow viewers to make their own interpretations.As for acting, like its mood and setting, so far it remains consistent to the previous ones. Expected some fine performances from Patrick Stewart, Halle Barry Kelsay Grammar and the ever magnificent Sir Ian McKellen (Magneto Rules!) but eventually, Hugh Jackman steals the show with some of his finest portrayal of the lone wolf Logan/Wolverine. Sure, we all wish every mutant got a crucial role in the movie but hey, sometimes you can't do everything to make it workable (if you are a filmmaker, what'd you have felt?).Despite its inevitable shortcomings and its lack of Bryan's brilliant input, X3 still proves to be a satisfying conclusion to the series, making way for more possible spin-offs such as Wolverine and Magneto and even possibly X4. Don't be tempted by the critical consensus by the major critics (they are so dead wrong); sometimes it's best to listen to your heart and decide.",9,0,1,27 May 2006
The Incredibles," A darn good show but not nearly as funny or emotional as 'The Iron Giant'
","Since watching Brad Bird's first animated film The Iron Giant, I am immensed with its surprisingly entertaining storyline and brilliant animation depicting the big robot as a child and the boy as his parent (yep, everything's done without irritating sing-along sequences and typical sidekicks). What gives this rare gem a powerful film is an unexpected and sometimes emotional 'twist' somewhere near the end which definitely lets the audience including myself to express our own emotions (hatred and even sympathy) towards the characters involved in this movie. Since then, I always consider this movie a real 'classic' of its own genre.Now, it's been five years since The Iron Giant and Bird once again takes the world finally with The Incredibles, an action-packed family film about the life of a superhero whose recognition as a crime fighter is marred by the public. And so, he marries a woman with elastic powers (hmm, almost reminds me of the 'Fantastic Four') and starts his own family which unfortunately leads to his pathetic days as an ordinary social worker (which is funny because he isn't used to this normal lifestyle since he himself is 'abnormal'!). Unlike any Pixar films, The Incredibles' is more of a bizarre mix of drama and comedy (and lots of family issues too) which, for some people's POV, is a refreshing change from the typical CGI movie fare. Of course, I have nothing against Pixar's awesome animation technique: the character's posture, emotions and facial expressions, despite their cartoony looks, seem more real than the fake-looking Polar Express's 'real' characters. Also, expect some Bird's favorite trademarks (Mr. Incredible banging the malfunctioning car door, the robot invasion, the retro elements and even the ever lovable Frank and Ollie cameos!) which are delicately picked up from The Iron Giant.However, despite the good stuff I have mentioned above, every good movies also need some criticism as well (sorry, adored fans of Pixar). The settings in the middle act are heavily (and obviously) borrowed from the X-Men movies by Bryan Singer (e.g. the futuristic ship, the backgrounds in the hidden base, the sky chase with missiles), ruining the movie's overall originality. Perhaps the sadder part of this sort of criticism is that, despite its incredible premises and technical wizardry Bird is trying to achieve, The Incredibles sadly doesn't capture the emotional and humorous tones of his previous outing The Iron Giant. It's quite surprising that I don't feel the same magical experiences that I earned in Iron Giant. Perhaps reviving the same old magic proves to be harder than expected but anyway, The Incredibles is still an enjoyable movie with great moments with Edna the cloth designer and even the most amazing chase and battle sequences ever created in animation history.Although The Incredibles lacks originality, watching it for the second (third, fourth and so on, thanks to DVD) time only proves how wonderful this movie is (combined with great and sometimes humorous dialogue and brilliant mise-en-scene that reflects its Golden Era atmosphere). Realizing that I can't think of a better storyline on a particular sequence, I congratulate Brad Bird and his entire team at Pixar for making such a serious animated film, not only with 'flexible' and appealing animation, but also with a big heart.",10,0,0,22 November 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Somehow, everything feels like Star Wars again...
","Once upon a time in a land far, far away, there was once a great 'knight' who stood up from his anonymity, learnt everything he saw and conquered all that were then deemed impossible to reach by many. But like any great legends, he too was scarred by the very bitter past that marred his status as a fighter, forcing him to step down and never to come back. However, his sense of determination and enthusiasm was beginning to mend, and like a little child who begins to learn to pick up a stick, he tries to regain his former self, only to stumble several times along his path to redeem himself. At long last, the struggling 'knight' had achieved his goal to become what he used to be many years ago. If you wonder who this 'knight' is, his name is George Lucas, famed director and creator of the popular sci-fi fantasy epic Star Wars, whose 30-year journey has recently ended with a bang with Episode III: Revenge of the Sith. As a treat to fans of the original, they will be delighted that many of the elements that make the original trilogy a classic have returned to this installment to bring a fitting conclusion to one of the most beloved movie sagas in history. That's right, expect the Wookies to make their appearances here, so do the X-Wing/Tie Fighter-like starfighters, Governor Tarkin, the clone troopers that now bear their resemblance to stormtroopers, the blockade runner, Darth Vader, the Death Star, etc. Wow.The movie opens with an incredible space battle over Coruscant (possibly the best I've ever seen so far), followed by series of unexpected fighting sequences and last-minute decisive actions which help build up the anticipation of Sith's overall theme. And if you think these jaw-dropping sequences aren't enough, George has provided some of his greatest tricks yet to be seen. As the Clone Wars reaches its zenith, the Jedi Council senses a far greater threat that originates from the core of the Republic but is unable to determine who the real culprit is. Anakin's relationship with Palpatine has become much closer as the Supreme Chancellor tells many of the Sith's unique qualities to his about-to-be apprentice. This further complicates the Council's worsened matters. Elsewhere, Padme begins to get worried about his beloved Anakin who seems to be troubled by the pressure of the Council itself (he is furious when he is not granted the rank of Master) and the political and corrupted principals of the Senate. These dilemmas eventually lead to a climatic showdown filled with emotional depths, unexpected concussions and terrible consequences so powerful, thought-provoking and satisfying that many fans will definitely change their perspective on the original trilogy (no wonder George twitches some details in the original trilogy DVD set) as well as the first two. And it tends to get better as we move along...Like the previous five, George once again proves his SFX mastery to create compelling worlds and creatures (which in fact look far more realistic this time around), thanks to the talented artists at ILM. Also, the classic John William score remains the significant highlights of Sith with similar tracks from Episodes I, II and IV. Aside from good storyline (we know that already), expect additional improvements including better script, characterizations and acting (thank goodness!). Hayden Christensen, whose portrayal of whining Anakin in Episode II horrifies some fans, finally gets his role right as he manages to express his hatred towards anything that stands in his way. Kudos to Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi) and Natalie Portman (Padme) who seem to feel comfortable with their characters as well. And let's not forget the truly delicious Ian McDiarmid as Darth Sidious/Palpatine (you'll never see anything like that before!). Truthfully, this movie will forever be remembered for its switching montages between Padme and Anakin at the end sequences; in fact, they are really the central pieces of the entire movie, whose inevitable destinies separate them on a sad and melancholic note, making way for a new revelation for Episode IV: A New Hope (thanks to its creative smooth editing). Of course, Revenge of the Sith still suffers from the limitations of the prequel trilogy that plagues the first two but the flow of the movie is so compelling and energetic you will tend to forgive and forget its shortcomings.Due to its political resemblance to the events of 9/11, many viewers wonder if George intends to relate it to the Bush Administration (in which he eventually declines, countering with the fact that democracy usually turns into dictatorship for the sake of power and history tends to repeat itself all over again). Funnily enough, Ronald Reagan once adopted the name Star Wars for promises of peace, so I guess it's a fair exchange.To sum it up, like Darth Vader at the end of Return of the Jedi, George has finally redeemed himself from the critical mistakes he made in the previous two episodes, producing a true masterpiece that is so worthy it eclipses everything the previous Star Wars movies have provided so far (sorry, Sith, The Empire Strikes Back still remains unmatched). Now that the saga is complete, we all leave the cinema with wide smiles all over our faces. I'm sure George will be pleased by the end results.",10,2,7,23 May 2005
The Terminal," Simple but quite charming!
","Although I never expect The Terminal, directed by the all-time genius Steven Spielberg, to feature bombastic special effects and create major attraction amongst the audience, this little gem turns out to be surprisingly funny and heart-warming compared to most movies I have seen this year. The plot is slightly more of a parody of Robert Zemeckis' Cast Away: Tom Hanks was once stranded in an unknown island. In The Terminal, he's once again stranded, this time however, in an airport in New York City. Viktor Navorski (the role that Tom plays) comes to America to accomplish one thing that his father has requested before he died but due to conflicts and government overthrow in Krakozhia, his visa and passport are no longer valid in the US, forcing him to stay put within the terminal. To make matters worse, Navorski's English proves to be a pain in the neck, often causing misinterpretations and confusion. But there lies the brilliance of Tom Hanks: every gesture and expression he made in each scene is naturally flawless and hilarious. As in any Spielberg film, the editing is smooth, the camera angles are creatively used in a rather dynamic way and of course, bits and pieces of clever gags to make sure that the audience don't get bored easily. If some speak of some miscast in this movie, well, that may be half true. Catherine Zeta Jones plays her role nicely, Stanley Tucci fits the role of the 'villain' extremely well and the rest manage to give The Terminal a sense of magic even if it isn't obviously there.I just only hope if Mr. Spielberg spends more time with the romantic relationship between Tom and Catherine but the rest of the production is plain exceptional. Overall, The Terminal is a perfect choice for lovers out there, including those in the airport.",8,0,0,23 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," One of everyone's favorite classics
","Star Wars is one of my favorite films because it has some old and new special effects that really attract me. Although it was made in 1977, it never looks old (the special edition will do it.) and it is nice to see our cult favorites again. Perhaps if I become a film maker, I would produce an awesome sci-fi film(or more) like Star Wars.",10,0,0,20 August 1998
