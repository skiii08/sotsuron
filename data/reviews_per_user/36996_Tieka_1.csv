The Blair Witch Project," The best Movie I have ever seen
","Lately I have become very disillusioned with film and television in general. I think as an audience we have been spoilt by special effects. I thought Blair Witch was a refreshing change and i give Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sanchez (II) points for going against the norm, they have given me faith in the film industry again.Before I saw it I had heard a lot about how good it was, and then about how overhyped it was. I have to tell you I was not disappointed at all. I loved the whole thing, from the very beginning. As for being a really scary movie, however, I did not really buy into that but my sister watched the whole thing through her hands covering her eyes.Most of the complaints I have heard about this movie I just don't find viable. For example there being no soundtrack, aren't we always complaining about how unrealistic movies are? Theres no cue in for music in real life either. I thought this was one of the best features of this excellent film.I also especially loved the shots of when Heather was running around, I really thought they added to atmosphere. They didnt make me feel sick. Heather was annoying but anyone that has worked with a small film project team will know that thats how it really is. I have never heard of an ending quite like hers though. That was great as well.I can see how this movie has achieved cult status, it definately has in my life. I went camping a few days after seeing it and spent a fair bit of time running around with my video camera ( because I also make docos) yelling 'tell me where you are Josh!!!'. My sister did not find this funny at 5 in the morning when she was sneaking back into the tent.Blair Witch is a great movie and very innovative simply because it isn't innovative. I loved it and I can not see why other people don't. It is a fantastic movie, definately worth the hype.",Null,0,1,16 January 2000
