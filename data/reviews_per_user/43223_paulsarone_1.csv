Alien 3," very underrated
","I first watched this film when I was a kid. I used to watch alien and aliens all the time and was so excited when this one came out. I was 13 when I watched it and thought it was crap because there were no guns but I have changed my mind and now rate it very highly. The directors cut is a lot better that the theatrical. The scene where the inmate goes mental and opens the door to release the 'dragon' is special not to mention the class chase scene through the aliens eyes and when the alien grabs Brian Glover from the ceiling. What about Charles Dance's exit? Class. The ending where the real Bishop turns up, again really good. The atmosphere is really downbeat and you think I don't wanna be in this situation. I think it is a fitting ending to a great series. The real travesty is Alien resurrection which doesn't fit into the series at all. This film is miles better than a lot of blockbusters that come out with fantastic fx and action scenes but shocking scripts and story(transformers springs to mind).",8,4,59,11 January 2009
