It," Tim Curry is my only Pennywise
","This was not an awful movie, but it just isn't as good as the 1990 version. I liked the way they updated it to take place in 1989 instead of the 1950's, and the changes they made to the story were rather cool in that there were surprises even though I am familiar with the story, and it showed parts that were left out of the 1990 version. And no disrespect to the guy who played Pennywise here, he was a good creepy clown, but he just didn't bring the magic the way Tim Curry did. I'm still hopeful about the sequel though.. I think doing a story of this size in two parts was the right call.",6,3,9,15 September 2017
Hero," The perfect action/historical fantasy movie?
","Beautiful to watch, past paced, engaging story, poignant at times. It never came of as overwrought or corny, which is a feat because this type of story could easily come off as melodramatic or campy. The cinematography and martial arts sequences were absolutely stunning. This movie was everything I want a historical action flick to be.",9,0,0,10 June 2017
