The Legend of Bagger Vance," Good Film: The Natural Plays A Golf Course
","My, my, what nerves have been touched, judging by the comments.This is a good film, and I appreciate anybody who makes a film about golf. It's lush, beautifully photographed, and well-acted, particularly by the second-tier actors. However, I am always a bit cautious about watching Hollywood do mysticism in sports. It's a bit like reading user comments by people who don't play golf. It's a bit like watching Hollywood do the American South.Bagger Vance is similar to many of the characters you can read about in true-life accounts of mysticsm. If you live long enough and welcome it, you will probably have an experience similar to Matt Damon's character. A strange person enters your life, doesn't seem quite human, seems to have direct knowledge of events and conditions most of us don't, and after helping, he leaves. It isn't so unusual. My guess is, it happens more often than we know. Somebody once went to Boris Pasternak and criticized Dr. Zhivago for having too many amazing events, to many  coincidences. Too many people who hadn't met in years just bumping into each other. Pasternak replied in so many words, if you don't believe in that, it's because you don't know Russia. That's how things are there. You expect them to happen because they're commonplace.So, the Will Smith character is completely reasonable, and the performance properly underplayed. Zen master/yogis generally don't get too excited or loud. There were some nice moments in the editing and sound. In our theater, at least, the movie opens in silence. The Fox logo comes up, and you expect the trumpets, but it's all quiet until we see Jack Lemmon playing golf. The very climax of the golfing also happens in silence. If I had to read anything mystical in that, it might be that our greatest achievement might be to reach the level of the Absolute, which is silence. By the way, I got the impression that Bagger Vance maybe saves the life of the Jack Lemmon character. It's subtle, but it is suggested. This is the kind of film you really want to see in a movie theater. It will lose a lot when it shrinks to the VCR and DVD. I forget the name of the course they shot it on, but the course itself is one of the charcters.
It will be a while before we know if anything spoken in the film drops into our day-to-day usage. Nobody says, 'Be the ball', but the movie does have some good moments. For people who don't play sports, a lot of what Bagger Vance says makes no sense, such as when he says Matt Damon needs to see the field clearly. WHAT? Well, there was a book or article written maybe 20 years ago by George Leonard, in which he discusses how the great basketball players have 'soft eyes', a vision which pulls in much more than the average player can see. It's inherent in us, but rarely developed.
Anyway, this is a good film, but one that challenges the viewer. If you don't believe in things you don't believe in, it's like watching fog. If you have had experiences in athletics or meditating, much of it will make sense.",7,0,1,4 November 2000
Meet the Parents," First Best in Show, and now this. Comedy Returns Big.
","This is a hilarious movie that provoked uncontrolled laughter in the theater, though people standing outside in line for their tickets were generally unamused.Finally, De Niro does a great job in a movie where he isn't a mob boss or a cop. Stiller and everybody else are also quite good in this.
I like the way the De Niro character is revealed bit by bit. We think we know him, and then we see something new. This continues throughout the movie, so things stay interesting. I'll never look at a lie detector again without thinking of this film.One of the most amusing moments is when Ben Stiller has to say grace. The movie telegraphs his prayer, though. Pay attention to the music playing when Stiller and De Niro visit the drugstore, and you'll know what his prayer becomes. It's a pleasure to see what Hollywood can do when talent prevails over pubesence.",Null,0,0,7 October 2000
Unbreakable," It's Okay: Slow Movie, Fast and Unexpected Ending
","I never saw Sixth Sense. Once I read the script and knew the ending, I didn't want to be tricked by a too-clever plot that seemed based upon the dimwittedness of the moviegoer. I went to Unbreakable because the storyline seemed fresh, compared to the sludge that Hollywood wants its moviegoers to pay money for, and to that degree, the movie works. Night builds a relationship between comics, the best in us, the worst in us, and the possibility that the worst in one person can help restore the wholeness of somebody else. That, by the end of the movie, is what has happened to the Bruce Willis character. He evolves in his relationships with his wife and his son, he overcomes his own 'kryptonite' problem, and he discovers his own inner powers. Also, he clears up a loose end or two in his past. He is more whole than before the train wreck. In this way, the story reminds me of the line that a biochemist in the Tom Cruise movie, MI 2, says. Every great hero needs a great villain.
I can't imagine this film developing the audience that Sixth Sense did. Much of this film is bleak, and I have to think the ending will irritate many. Anytime you have to end a film with captions, the way they used to end episodes of Dragnet with verbal captions ('Mr Ramirez was found guilty of selling ice cream cones to diabetics, and is now serving 6-10 at Robbins State Pen'), you know the plot has a problem. I was completely unprepared for it. When it happens, you are likely to think, 'That's it?' It will make sense, but it will feel unsatisfactory. The film is well-acted. I was impressed by Jackson, because he plays a man that few will like. He's an angry man who does angry things to people. Too many actors won't play such a character. Willis was good, and it was good to see Robin Wright Penn. Spencer Treat Clark was good as the son.
Overall, it's a decent sophmore effort. It's like the second album by a rock group. You know it can't be as good as the original hit (leaving aside the Beatles and a few others). Still, this is a good film.",Null,0,1,22 November 2000
American Beauty," See This Film.
","This is a great film. Give the Oscar to Spacey, and probably one to Bening.
This is a hard film to categorize. I'm reminded of Princess Bride, not a similar film, but a film that was also hard to promote because it wasn't just one kind of movie. I didn't know much about the film when I went, but was put off by the only plot line I knew, that a middleage dad falls in love with his daughter's friend. That never dominates the film, fortunately. As Spacey is swept away by his personal life changes, the question of will he or won't he make it with the daughter's friend is put on the back shelf for most of the film.This is a completely wonderful film, but it left me wondering something. Virtually everybody's life in this movie is destroyed. It leaves the viewer to speculate how each character left standing will adapt. Why, then, did I have such a feeling of wonder about it? In many ways, it's Ordinary People with laughs. It works because Spacey shows how somebody can find himself after years in a wasteland. Wes Bentley, the boy next door, has a gift for seeing the beauty in all things, and for feeling a connection with the flow of the universe. The film shows us those gifts, and that's part of its success. The movie also shows on a subtle plane the power of the spoken word. There's this idea that anything we say is broadcast to the mystical universe, then created for us if our intention or power is strong enough. There's a point in the film when Spacey says he will frame the company's management evaluator, Brad, for sexual misconduct. Later in the film, it is Spacey who is framed for sexual misconduct, as seen by the retired Marine colonel. Similarly, Spacey's daughter wants her dad dead, Wes Bentley offers to do it, and even though they both agree it isn't  something they really want, conditions are changed just enough to create that reality.
I hope this film gets the Oscars, but it's dark and risky. I admire the cast for putting so much into this film, knowing that when they entered the project. You can't run ads for it as a feel good movie, but I left the theater wanting to see a plastic bag being whipped around by the wind.",9,0,0,30 September 1999
Mission: Impossible II," Good Summer Action Movie
","Of course it's over the top. Of course it's implausible. Of course it's Woo repeating ideas from his other films. Of course, of course, blah-blah.This is a very good summer action movie. It has so many plot holes, they should have filmed it in Switzerland. Still, it has great action sequences, it is not gratuitously violent, it has a couple of interesting plot twists (usually involving identities), and it's a good travelogue of Australia. Most of all, it does not end with a helicopter chase under the English Channel. Oh, it also civilizes the audience by giving them a little culture about the ancient mythological being, Chimera. So, I give it good marks for doing exactly what it should, and even Anthony Hopkins is there to remind us what real acting is about.Oh, there's no way Tom Cruise did all those stunts. I know, John Woo says he did, and his wife is supposed to have been angry at Tom for doing them. Nope. I think when Woo is quoted as saying, 'Tom did all his own stunts', it really means, he did all the ones that he did. Nevermind, Tom seems to have a lot more fun in this film than in the first, and he even pokes fun at himself;  the evil character complains about the hardest part impersonating Cruise's character once in disguise: it was flashing that silly grin every fifteen minutes. Sean Connery was good as James Bond, but Dr. No wasn't his best acting performance. By Goldfinger and Thunderball, though, he had hit his own tempo wonderfully. Maybe MI3 and MI4 will do the same for Cruise.",Null,0,0,24 May 2000
