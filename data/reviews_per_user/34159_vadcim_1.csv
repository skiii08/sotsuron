Black Swan," Don't waste your time or money...
",Let me start by saying that I'd give this movie 0 starts if it was an option but alas it was not. My wife and I value IMDb as a resource to assist us in deciding which movie to see.Both time and money are hard to waste in this day and age and I feel very surprised that so many folks here missed on this movie. I have never left a theater during a movie in my life and though I seriously considered it I did not. I did however check my watch 15 minutes in and every 15-20 minutes for the duration of this utterly uninspiring film.Black Swan is billed as a Thriller - NOTHING - nothing was thrilling in this movie. In fact there were some laughs in the crowd at some of the overdone/hokey 'Thrilling' scenes.Save your money and your time and go and see something else.,1,29,87,2 January 2011
