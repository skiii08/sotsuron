Lucky Number Slevin," Awful and Infantile writing/directing/acting
","I went to see this movie cause I like a good assassin flick. I checked its rating and it was above 7 so it seemed OK. However I will be less fool hearty next time around. I didn't factor in that the film is still fresh and that its current rating is not a true representation of the movie watching populous. This is the movie writing debut of Jason Smilovic. He comes from a glorious position of writing for 'Karn Sisco', a bad TV show. And that is what this movie resembles most, TV quality writing with so many one/two liners it makes me sick. The writer makes many references to good films in the movie via characters referencing them themselves, which shows he fancies himself a film buff, but too bad he cannot write a good film himself. Over all, half the dialogue was unnecessary and is there just for show. I felt like I was watching Gilmore Girls. WAY too much banter. The plot itself is an elaborate 'revenge fantasy' type movie. With so many twists that by the end you stop caring about them. There is fad growing in movies today where producers think twists=good. Too many movies have this elaborate plot where you think something is going to happen and when it doesn't the movie takes all this time to explain how they 'fooled you' in flash backs(ie. see it wasn't really him, he was over here so he didn't die and then.......). The directing was not very effective either. The movie relied on editing effects that would wow the hip-hop generation who are easily amused with fast motion photography, different filters and stupid little cgi trickery. Furthermore, I hate Josh Hartnett, I didn't know it till today, but I do. What an awful actor. He belongs on TV where he will fit in better. His 'acting'is especially awful when put alongside Ben Kingsly and Morgan Freeman. He is just awwwwwwful. I am sure the movie is OK for those who will like anything with guns in it, but I am not so simple(minded). Mostly I am just mad that I was duped. I should have known better. Usually I trust my instincts but I didn't even use them this time. Poorly conceived and poorly executed sophomoric crap.",3,26,61,11 April 2006
