Catch Me If You Can," another masterpiece of Steven Spielberg
","This movie is in the top 250 list, so I thought that it's a must see movie, also, Leonardo DiCaprio plays the main character, which helped me to made my mind. And I didn't regret watching it. The move is simple, easy to watch, however, the story is extremely interesting. The cast is absolutely amazing, every single character played their role almost flawless. Since it's based on the true story, the script was written very well and even thought the movie was a bit too long, it was not boring at all and it kept me wanting and I was excited to see what other thing Frank (DiCaprio's character) is going to fake next. It's another masterpiece of Steven Spielberg and it's definitely in that list of movies which you must see in your lifetime.",8,0,2,15 November 2016
The Shawshank Redemption," labeled as that 'unique prison movie'
","This movie is the first in the top 250 list and I agree that it's a masterpiece. The actors chosen were incredible and the whole story was extremely interesting and involving. However, there were few flaws. In my opinion, the movie needed more action. Even thought the tension and action was building up as the minutes passed, it was not growing fast enough and after some time it get a little boring. Thankfully, the ending is astonishing and it makes you forget all the bad things that happened before in the movie. It can easily be labeled as that 'unique prison movie' which will never be over-passed in this category because there's never going to me a movie like this. There's no doubt that Morgan Freeman is the hero of the film with his acting and effort. In the end, the movie is a real masterpiece but I cannot call it the best movie ever made.",8,0,1,15 November 2016
