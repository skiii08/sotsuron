The Sound of Music," Do you like roses?
","Inspired by true story but utterly lacking reality, Sound of Music is a beloved and hated musical about Austrian novice (Julie Andrews) who becomes a governess of seven children, falls in love with their widowed father (Christopher Plummer)and eventually escapes Natzis with the family. Beautiful and clean and sweet like chocolate-box, smelling with roses, Sound of music is well-made product of old-fashioned, skill-filled Hollywood. It is totally unrealistic escapism, and, according to Milan Kundera, movies like this are denying of crap. Oh, yes, Milan, so they are... so they indeed are! And that's good, because I prefer roses.",7,2,11,19 September 2008
The Young Victoria," Handsomely produced historical drama
","This movie about young queen Victoria, written by Julian Fellowes and directed by Jean-Marc Vallee, looks handsome in big screen, despite realistically flat lighting - shown especially in outdoor scenes and reminding the 18th century painter Francois Boucher's apt comment of nature being 'badly lit'. The film follows love story between prince Albert and Victoria, and criticizes rightfully Victoria's friend, totally rotten Lord Melbourne. This man did not only think that poor should be forgotten, he also was a murderer: after mistreated poor rioted in Wales in 1831 in so-called Merthyr rising he told a witness to lie so a non-guilty man could be hanged for wounding a soldier. There is pretty dresses, lavish dinners and quite good pacing for such a talkative story - I looked my watch only once. Nothing too impressive visually or drama-wise, but OK film.",6,3,9,8 August 2009
Underworld," Entertainment which does not entertain
","Visually unattractive, Underworld looks like it has been shot as black and white through a blue filter, causing a dull look. Sets are ugly. Kate Beckinsale in leather? Yawn. There is lot of action and posing, but no style, fun or atmosphere. And that's the point of the vampire/werewolf movies, right? Be entertaining? Of course Kate get to do lot of action scenes, and after all, every run-of-the-mill action movie features such heroines so the Hollywood actresses can say: 'It is really surprising to see a film like this - with a strong woman!' But her character does not seem a vampire at all. Sorry, but vampires should be a bit more vampiric. And better dressers. She just run around in her Matrix-inspired wardrobe shooting and killing werewolves like a female reject from John Woo movie. Believe me, I did not expected to see some pretentious artsy crap. But vampire films should not be trashy action movies either. Vampires in modern world? Great! But DO NOT make it this way!",3,1,3,23 April 2008
Sleepy Hollow," Pretty but empty
","This 'free adaptation' of Washington Irving's old tale - and then they say 1992 Dracula was not faithful! - boasts with a very nice-looking Halloween card look, and not much else. The story is simply a bit dull, with some nice shots of Headless horseman riding through the forest and lot of decapitating and sympathetic 18th century geek Ichabod Crane courting prettily dressed pagan heroine Katrina. Nothing too impressive, really. There's also some on-target mockery of squalid Christian conservatism: unlike, let's say, pre-marital sex between lovers, the filth and sadism is OK - at least if it's in Bible and in the name of Bible because, ya know, it's Bible!...",6,0,0,16 April 2008
Alien," Ugliness personified
","I am not much of a sci-fi fan, and this film shows the reason. You get the ugly-as-hell sets - the space-ship can't look too pretty, after all - and the protagonist Sigourney Weaver (who makes a strip tease in the end in hideously ugly T-shirt and equally ugly panties) is dull like all the characters - we don't really know anything about her, except that she outsmarts the monster in the end. The monster is ugly and dull, disgustingly drooling creature which kills humans. Some ugly gore, too. Atmosphere is non-existent. The cute cat is saved, though, and the equally bad - sometimes even worse - sequels were made. Now I probably should go to entertain myself with watching the paint drying...",2,3,33,10 May 2008
Apocalypse Now," Not too impressive
","Artsy, boring movie: the men sail at the river in the midst of the Vietnam war and search the independently lethal Kurtz. The story and all the characters bore me to tears, including Marlon Brando as Kurtz - yes, he is an independent killer in the midst of the war, ah, the irony! Joseph Conrad's early 20th century novella Heart of the Darkness, set in the brutally exploited, Belgian-ruled concentration camp called Kongo, is now a study of the Vietnam War. No, I have not read the original, so I don't know how faithful adaptation of the original and it's themes this is. But why a real movie has a real-life animal killing a'la -10 exploitation excrement?",2,4,12,2 May 2008
Van Helsing," Surprisingly enjoyable
","First, when I read an Empire article, I almost cried. Another Underworld? CGI overkill with the photography through the blue, grey or sickly green filter? The positive tone of that sleazy rag did not really help, either. I mean, USUALLY I avoid the filthy perversions of human flies... err, critics and movie magazine journalists like a John Waters movie, but hey, this was an article of a monster mash, so how could I resist not to buy the rag? Anyway, after seeing the movie I found my fears unwarranted - despite the plot less action, all the CGI, awful cooler-than-thou nods to James Bond (movies I hate) and Kate Beckinsale's strrrong woman I found this Universal homage surprisingly enjoyable. The fairy-tale version of 'late 19th century Tr√§nsylveinia', a place of the aristocratically evil vampires, sinister castles, moonlit forests, the werewolves and Frankenstein's monster, won me over. The gorgeously dressed vampire brides were especially fun, managing to steal the whole show with their looks and fun attitude. The only good Stephen Sommers film.",8,3,4,3 June 2008
Gone with the Wind," Gorgeous movie of trashy people
","Even after 70 years, this film holds it's own pretty well. The jewel-like 1930s Technicolor makes the ornate 19th century sets and lovely gowns look even more stunning, the story has epic sweep, and heroine Scarlett is both lovely and lively, albeit ultimately (and by accident) portrayed as truly ugly human being, just like every member of Southern upper-class. White trash indeed! (And no, this is not racism, I'm white!) All this comes from the source of GWTW, the novel by Margaret Mitchell, which is a love letter to the antebellum South but seems sometimes almost despising the characters. Her book is still quite good romantic drama, if one can stomach the sporadic whining and self-pity - it is thankfully largely cut from this movie.",8,1,3,10 May 2008
The Hurricane," Evil movie
","I give this movie two star and that's generous. This story of mediocre boxer and cold-blooded murderer Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter is lies from beginning to the end - it could be funny if it was so wrong. Leaving out 'antisemitism' of schizophrenic from Beautiful mind is one thing, making a victim of violent young scum as a pedophile is another. (Yes, the pedo beaten by young Carter was not pedophile at all.) The film also vilifies boxer who won Carter - guy must be racist and the match rigged ! - and invents a racist cop who hates Carter. The evidence against Carter is not noticed, nor his habits to beat women. What on Earth screenwriter or anybody else thought?",2,7,12,16 August 2009
Titanic," Wonderful spectacle, uneven script
","This is propably most visually beautiful Titanic film ever made, showing the Gilded Age luxury in Titanic authentically, while the drama of the drowning scenes is heart-wrenching. Score is just perfect icing of the cake (My heart will go on!). But Rose (who looks like that gorgeous flower, but only superficially) is one of those strong, feisty heroines who are actually spoiled, whiny and unsympathetic, attacking the male servants because, ya know, 1st class female passenger is a victim and the male servant an evil patriarch. Sorry, Jim, don't buy it. But it is still one James Cameron film which is not full of ugly hi-tech for plot AND visuals.",7,0,2,7 April 2008
Bram Stoker's Dracula," A cinematic masterpiece
","Journalist asked once from Ernest Hemingway, what he thought now that Hollywood had destructed his books. Hemingway said something like: 'What do you mean 'destructed'? My books are there, on the book-shelf.' Mistitled Bram Stoker's Dracula is not Stoker's 1897 novel, not more than Hammer's wonderful Dracula movies with overrated Christopher Lee. James V. Hart's ambitious, cinematic script follows the plot quite faithfully, but makes changes to the characters and their relationships. Costumes, studio sets and rich colour photography have fruitcake, visually glorious and romantic fairytale quality, mixing a period and the Gothic, and the music score is equally sublime. Mina and Lucy are gorgeous like angels in their dresses, full of lust for life, and Gary Oldman's Dracula is a mix of the vampiric evil and the dark grandeur. Even nicely old-fashioned special effects are lovely. Despite all the negative crap said and written about this movie, Bram Stoker's Dracula is a wonderful movie.",10,1,3,7 March 2008
Halloween," Overrated
","This film has admittedly a great idea: the psycho killer targets his young victims in Halloween! A study of spooky atmosphere, then? Err, no, there is not wonderful Halloween atmosphere here, just lot of waiting, talking and some murders, albeit the movie is thankfully gore-free and the theme music is great. The heroine Laurie is sort of pure and innocent wall-flower type, although she was followed by the irritating parade of the sex-hating, misogynistic slashers with their tomboyish Final girls. Even Carpenter mocked these tomboy virgins as sexually frustrated pervs, who needed the sharp objects to 'penetrate' the body. Such witticism aside, the script by Carpenter and Debra Hill is not too good either, with Carpenter apparently claiming that one of his inspirations was a mentally ill boy he had seen in a psychiatric hospital, a psychotic with 'evil stare'. Gee, Carpenter, isn't it great exploiting a person's illness because he had an Evil Eye? Um, no, it's tasteless and SLEAZY! But that's all too typical to modern horror genre: wallow in the sewer of your own head, but kill the mentally ill 'psycho' in the end of your story!",4,3,7,30 April 2008
The Matrix," Cooler-than-thou, looks awful
","Columbine killers apparently liked this story of computer genius Keanu Reeves who must to save the world from the illusion called Matrix. No, they didn't deserve to be tortured in the school, no one does, and instead of massacre they just should have make their tormentors to taste their own medicine in long and repeated intervals - but gaaawd, the duo's taste was awful. Cooler-than-thou posing and 'action' while bystanders are brutally killed - that's the plot. High-tech imagery is ugly as hell - costumes, sets and photography look AWFUL. No, this is not -10 exploitation sleaze or crap like that, it is a real movie, but it is a bad one. And ugly, if I didn't already mention it.",1,8,22,27 May 2009
