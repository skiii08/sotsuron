Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Entertaining, but 'could do better'
","I've been familiar with the Borat character from Cohen's Ali G shows in the UK, so knew what to expect. He's at his very best with unsuspecting members of authority, from small gun clubs through to government figures, where he can cajole them into saying things they'd rather not, or certainly wouldn't say on national TV. There are some Borat clips available from his time in the US which were not included in the film and I wondered why, because some of these were much funnier than what was included. However, the confrontations with the unsuspecting were still good and worth watching. Maybe not enough of them for me.There are pieces which are obviously set up, and this is where it falls flat because you know the 'unsuspecting' are actually in on it. OK, it needs a rolling story, and the hotel naked fight with his adviser was funny/ridiculous and parts of this made me wonder why on earth he'd put his naked frame up against the anger of a big hotel security guard who may not have had the opportunity to bash someone in a while. He does suffer for his art in places here.In one of early encounters with a genuine 'unsuspector' it's funny that he gets the guy to state that he wants homosexuals hanged! This is the art of making ordinary people be free with their outrageous prejudices, and his TV show was centered completely around this. Here, we don't get enough.Overall, there are some laughs, certainly a lot of laughs if you love him to bits, or have never seen him. I for one, am glad to see such non-PC outrage back on the screen, and it would only be a fool to take him seriously.",7,1,5,10 January 2007
Scary Movie 2," The weakest parody I've ever seen
","This movie is terrible. I struggle to understand how this got commissioned at all. The 'movie parody' parts are hardly parodies at all, and the scenes outside of this are weak, weak, weak on comedy.The very first movie parody is of The Exorcist and I'd love the writers to explain to me how they have expanded the original to make it funny.Whereas movies like Airplane or Naked Gun used killer humour, this goes for a simple 'pie in the face' or 'fart' scenes, some of which are unintelligible to anyone outside of American sub culture.The Wayan brothers certainly have a charmed life in Hollywood.'Airplane' started all of this - but at least that was funny, witty and had some sort of plot.",1,5,11,8 April 2006
Green Street Hooligans," Convaluted. A trite opening, which slips in an OK story later.
","Elijah Wood must have needed the cash. I must admit, when I first heard he was making a film like this, I thought it was bad casting. I thought that on actually seeing the film, but I don't think it was a self-fulling prophecy. He just doesn't look right, feel right or seem right in the role.The first thirty minutes move Wood's character into hooliganism too quickly and unrealistically. He's mentored by a thug who forces the cockney accent so much that it's a parody and at times he (the thug) falls into what can only be described as some sort of West country accent. It is quite unrealistic why Wood's character becomes so fiercely friendly with the thug.Wood's first visit to a game, shows nothing in his apparent instant interest. Compare this to 'Fever Pitch' where the young boy enters the stadium for the first time and sees the crowd, hears the roar and sees the expanse of green pitch. Then we see his expression. It's obvious the boy has been turned to the sport. In Hooligans (Green Street in UK), there is a similar scene which is wasted for such an opportunity.To be fair, the next part introduces some conflict in characters and a twist (of sorts), to make the film vaguely watchable.",3,0,0,10 February 2006
National Treasure," Bargain bin DVD purchase
","But at £5, it wasn't a bargain. The film obviously tries to take from Indiana Jones, but fails miserably. Whereas the Indy films had great characters, plot and action, this film has none of those. A decent cast struggle with such awful dialogue and plot, it made me wonder why they had agreed to it in the first place. A sub DaVinci Code clues/puzzles line is so insipid, and wrapped up in the mediocre, done-so-many-times-before hero gets girl, has a sidekick who provides silly lines, villain (not a very good one) gets comeuppance and (quite ridiculous ending) heroes all get very rich. If you are expecting anything like Raiders, you will be sadly disappointed. If you are pre-teen, you might get a little fun out of it, but otherwise, this is a poorly made, badly constructed and lazily delivered film.",3,2,3,17 October 2008
Signs," A cheap alternative to sleeping pills
","As a sci-fi fan, I looked forward to this film, although being slightly uneasy about the director's previous project 'Unbreakable'.Signs is overall a thinking film, but to get through it, you will need lots of caffine. The dialogue is so slowly whispered throughout and the scenes played even slower. If I had a penny for saying 'get on with it' throughout the film, I'd have Â£1.68.Mel Gibson hardly moves and basically keeps the same dour expression throughout. The kids are robotically weird and the minor characters lifeless.Not once did I see these characters as believeable.As with Unbreakable, the director, M Night Shyamalan, has given a thoroughly boring movie experience.",1,4,7,4 May 2004
