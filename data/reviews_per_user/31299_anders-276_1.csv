Walk the Line," Excellent
","Love is a burning thing and it makes a firery ring bound by wild desire I fell in to a ring of fire...I fell in to a burning ring of fire I went down,down,down and the flames went higher. And it burns,burns,burns the ring of fire the ring of fire.The taste of love is sweet when hearts like our's meet I fell for you like a child oh, but the fire went wild..--- Come and hold my hand I wanna contact the living Not sure I understand This role I've been given I sit and talk to God And he just laughs at my plans My head speaks a language I don't understand.I just wanna feel Real love fill the home that I live in Cos I got too much life Running through my veins Going to waste I don't wanna die But I ain't keen on living either Before I fall in love I'm preparing to leave her.Scare myself to dead That's why I keep on running Before I arrive I can see myself coming.I just wanna feel Real love fill the home that I live in Cos I got too much life Running through my veins Going to waste And I need to feel Real love and the love ever after I can not get enough.I just wanna feel Real love fill the home that I live in I got too much love Running through my veins To go to waste.I just wanna feel Real love and the love ever after There's a hole in my soul You can see it in my face It's a real big place.Come and hold my hand I wanna contact the living Not sure I understand This role I've been given.",10,1,2,6 January 2007
