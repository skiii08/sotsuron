The Blair Witch Project," Very simple. Even YOU can do it. RECIPE below.
","Items need: 1) video camera 2) camping gear 3) timeIf you have gotten lost in the woods you too can relate.  Throw in a hint of Deliverance, a hint of the supernatural, and WALAH! you have yourself a movie.",6,0,1,9 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The more you see it the more you see
","For all the nay-sayers out there, go see Phantom Menace again.  I have seen it, so far, 4 times. With each viewing, I seem to enjoy it more.  Granted the first time I saw it I sort of got lost.  The second time it made a little more sense.  The third time-ahhhh.  The 4th time superb.  This movie is deeper than what you initially see on the screen.  ****1/2 out of *****",8,0,0,1 June 1999
U-571," Action, Loud, more action, louder
","If you like LOUD, testosterone pumping movies this one is for you. That would adequately describe this one. ***1/2 out of *****.",7,0,1,21 April 2000
The Patriot," An excellent movie it is.......
","For all the nay-sayers and nit-pickers, just admit that this is one hell-of-a movie.  As this movie touches on History it does not claim to be a Documentary.  Name one movie that is historically correct.......... If you are thinking about going to see this movie do. As, I was skeptical, I almost made the mistake of not going. Never during the 2 hours and 44 min. does this movie drag or become unbelievable.  If I wanted a History lesson a would take one.  ****1/2 out of *****",9,3,7,16 July 2000
American History X," Not what I expected......
","....and in this case, it was most welcome. American History X should be on the required viewing list for ALL High school students. I am trying to find a weak spot in the film, but I can't. This movie points out, and to, everything that is wrong in America.....'nuff said.... MUST SEE!!  **** out of *****",8,0,0,20 May 1999
Saving Private Ryan," Intense
","Not being a big fan of Tom Hanks or movies that seem to get blown up reviews. I went into this movie prepared for a let down from all the pre-release hype. How can ANYBODY say 'what war is like' unless they have been in one?  If you see SPR you will feel like you have, the only difference is you come back alive. After the first assault on the audiences' senses, SPR tracks a group of 8 men sent out to bring back one. For all the people who say the plot is unbelievable or the characters 'weak', that is hogwash. This is one of the best movies of all time-maybe not THE BEST but it ranks up there with SCHINDLER'S LIST, GONE with the WIND, and all the other academy award winners. Check out the movie, be your own judge. I saw it in SDDS THX and I wouldn't recommend seeing it in anything else.  Invest the $6.00 or $7.00 dollars and YOU determine if 'WAR IS HELL'",10,0,0,5 August 1998
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A Sense of Dejavu
","I went to this movie hoping for a unique experience.  I left with a feeling of I've seen this several times. This movie seems to borrow heavily from several films and the more I think about it it seems to blatantly rip-off several films. This Movie has 1. desciples in training w/ Masters ......hmm   perhaps Star Wars. 2. this movie has  villains JADE FOX a chinese version of DARTH MAUL or DARTH VADER. 3. speaking of Masters notice the similarity of Li Mu Bai and Qui-Gon Jinn. 4. KUNG FU -  'I know KUNG FU'  those moves look really familiar..  hold it that was NEO in THE MATRIX. 5. Did I say KUNG FU.  yes I think they stole something from 'Grasshopper' remember David Carradine???? 6. Those Sword Fights with the placement of the swords. Darth vs. OBI_WAN. This movie Replaced Light Sabers with Swords. I have to stop I will exceed the 1000 word allotment. The only thing I can recommend about Crouching Dragon is some of the effects, although we have seen the same moves and effects in THE MATRIX and in the EPISODE I, they are ok. If you want an excellent martial arts Foreign Flick with originality see SEVEN SAMURAI. This Movie is NOT EVEN the quality or orginality of SEVEN SAMURAI so I will not even compare the two. If anyone can email or tell me why in the Hell is this picture nominated for BEST PICTURE, please do..... ***** out of 10.. for cinematography and effects.",2,0,1,16 February 2001
The Matrix," Very short review
","I don't think I can describe this movie in any short manner.  So, I won't begin.  It is worth checking out. Watch for Agent Smith, he is  one of the highlights.  Don't go to the bathroom or concessions during the movie.... ***1/2 out of *****",9,0,0,1 April 1999
The Wizard of Oz," on The BIG Screen is totally different.
","This was a good movie when I was a kid.  And was UNCOOL in my teens & 20's. Is now --- well-- the movie speaks for itself. The 60 year revamped version on the big screen. WOW. Look at all the things you can see. The details, the little things you can't see on the TV. Impressive. You get the experience and the Magic that is THE WIZARD OF OZ. This is a MUST see on the big screen. Follow the yellow brick road to a theater or you WILL regret it later. ****1/2 out of *****.",8,2,3,9 November 1998
Evil Dead II," I don't believe what it was I think I saw.
","After seeing Evil Dead 1 on DVD.  I thought KICK butt. So, I went out and bought the limited collectors tin of EVIL DEAD 2. I have since put it up for auction on ebay. This movie is bad (and I mean in the awful way). It is far from scary, unlike the 1st. Sam Raimi made it a gore fest and forgot how to make a movie. It tries to spoof, it is far from funny. In fact it is far from everything but bad, and boy does this movie nail that. Now I know why Bruce Campbell wants to be referred to as Bruce 'don't call me Ash' Campbell.  *1/2 out of *****.",3,1,8,31 October 2000
