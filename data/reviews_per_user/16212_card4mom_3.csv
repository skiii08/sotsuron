50 First Dates," Hysterical
",The chemistry was there. Both my husband and myself loved the movie and he is not an Adam Sandler fan.  Some very funny bits in this delightful movie. Drew Barrymore was adorable and the supporting cast was perfect.,9,0,0,13 February 2004
Lost in Translation," Boring
",The worst movie I think I have ever seen.  . Except for two funny moments before I walked out of the room the movie was infuriatingly dull. Bill Murray just walked through his part. Can' imagine how it gets such a good review.,1,7,17,13 February 2004
Gangs of New York," Too violent to be believed. Disgustingly so.
",Over the top graphic violence.  If I wasn't with my husband I would have walked out of the theater. The scenery was wonderful and I did like the costumes.  Daniel Day Lewis and Leo nothing special in the acting department.  Jack Nicholson should get the Oscar for Schmidt.,1,6,14,12 April 2003
