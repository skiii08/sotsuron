Mission: Impossible III," Get Real!
","Okay, here's what I'm tired of: Over the top action films. I told myself I wasn't going to see another MI installment after that ridiculous rock climbing stunt in the last one. Is it not possible to have a regular action movie with regular, BELIEVALBE stunts? You want me to believe that Ethan Hunt gets blasted up against a car and doesn't break his back? He's just able to keep right on going after that, huh? Okay, they needed to put a disclaimer up stating that people are required to suspend their beliefs in order to view the film. I'm actually a Tom Cruise fan but I'm so damn tired of seeing him in these ridiculous action films.",2,2,5,10 May 2006
