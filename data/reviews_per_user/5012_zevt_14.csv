Hereditary," Almost a masterpiece - frustrating writing/ending
","This is an impressive horror movie with a lot going for it, but it is plagued by modern-day lazy writing which will frustrate a thinking audience. Lovers of this movie obviously haven't thought everything through as I will demonstrate below. And the slow-pace seemingly turned off a whole bunch of others, even though the superb gradually-building horror is one of its great strengths. The other impressive aspect is the acting, and this is universally acclaimed.It's about a family plagued by disturbing horror that has made them thoroughly dysfunctional. One death after another, each surrounded by mysterious and strange details, and their lives are constantly made worse by spooky hauntings and strange behavior and events. Suspicions of insanity are conflated with supernatural horror.The movie uses a heavy horror soundtrack and knows how to get under your skin using a mixture of classic horror and disturbing family drama and behavior. It does not resort to cheap jump-scares. (In fact, the movie could have been good even without the supernatural stuff by simply exploring insanity from trauma).*major spoilers follow*The one movie that this can be strongly compared to in terms of ideas and plot is Rosemary's Baby.The stuff that is clearly thought-out:Grandmother was obviously the leader of this cult that was trying to invoke Paimon in the bodies of her grandchildren. Presumably she wanted it done to her offspring for some reason, and they had to be young and 'vulnerable'. The previous attempt failed (Charlie) since she was female and they didn't know that this was important, and they had to kill her by invoking magic to undo it. There was also another failed attempt mentioned in the support meeting performed on Annie's brother. The rest of their efforts concentrated on Peter, whom they had to kill so that Paimon could take over his body. They even used and controlled her daughter (Annie) through 'sleepwalking' and possession to get their way, which is why she did all those strange and disturbing things to Peter.Joan, a cult member, was pure manipulation to get their way through psychological trickery (rather than possession which wasn't working so far). The seance was a distraction just to get her to read the incantation and involve her family and to bring Paimon's spirit into the house by calling Charlie's spirit (which previously hosted Paimon). This worked and escalated the horrors since Paimon was now hanging around the family as a malicious spirit, and it even tried killing Peter in school on its own. So their goal was to kill Peter for Paimon who was only now ready to take him.And now the stuff that wasn't thought through:<ul><li>If all they needed was Peter to die, then why didn't any of the cult members simply kill him in his sleep or some other way after Annie read the incantation? They had free access to the house obviously as is made clear many times. And it didn't require magic since obviously suicide was enough. And it didn't require him being scared and vulnerable since he obviously was petrified many times beforehand.</li></ul><ul><li>If Annie had successfully burned Peter while 'sleepwalking' in the past, wouldn't this have deprived them of his body for Paimon? Plus, they hadn't yet released Paimon from Charlie at that time. So none of this sleepwalking stuff makes sense. Unless it was only her insanity added for random shock value.</li></ul><ul><li>What was the big deal with the book that she tried to burn? It's just stupid pictures. Why did she believe it would help in any way? And why did the father burn down instead of her even though she threw it in the flames? Why did anyone burn at all? Either the book is meaningless in which case her motivation has no logic, or it is meaningful and yet it had no effect except to burn random people. 'Random malicious games by an evil spirit' doesn't explain why she was obsessed with the book to begin with while she was awake.</li></ul><ul><li>What was the point of having Annie decapitate herself at that point towards the end? She was a useful tool until then and still hadn't achieved her purpose. So one can't even attribute this to 'random evil' from a being that likes decapitating people, since it's against their own interests. I mean they obviously were desperately trying to have her kill Peter until now and he still wasn't dead. In fact, what killed him was his own suicide from the surprise-shock of the three naked cult members after that. Which, once again, seems completely random and this from a cult that otherwise made careful plans. Inconsistencies galore!</li></ul><ul><li>What's the point of the headless corpses? They were obviously dead since besides being headless, they were also decomposing and not moving. So why would the cult bother bringing them into the house and have them bow down in the final scene? Just more pointless shock tactics for the audience rather than the plot.</li></ul>In summary: The atmosphere and acting get 9 or even 10. The writing gets 8 or 1 depending on specific aspects of the plot. The problem is that the movie is effectively disturbing and seems like a great horror movie for most of its running time, except that the ending leaves you with unanswerable questions that don't allow the movie to make any sense. It's not just full of random malicious acts, it's also inconsistent with clearly stated motivations. So the frustration trumps the movie. This is a trend with recent horror movies that string together a bunch of creepy or shocking scenes for their own sake without tying them to the plot, or even working out whether they contradict the plot.",7,4,5,6 November 2019
The Prestige," The Final Line of the Movie
","I'm not going to add one more redundant review to the thousands already here, but I do feel the need to make some points about the last line in the movie (without spoilers and without revealing the secret or making it easy).Note that I am not talking about the double twist ending that explains everything - I am talking about the final line that seems to add one more point after the twists are done.Nolan is a very logical writer and makes every detail in his movies fit together like a puzzle. He even made dreams into something very mechanical in Inception. He always plays it straight and gives the audience plenty of clues, allowing us to catch on to everything as long as we focus and use our brains.So the last line in this movie puzzled me because it seemed to just be an ambiguous tease whereas everything before then was made very clear, and this doesn't fit in with Nolan's style.In addition, the sci-fi elements in this movie bothered me. They didn't fit either. But the final line in the movie turns these into something else in a brilliant way.There is a very definite and obvious solution to all this, and the final line is very clear once you understand what it is saying and figure out its secret. But don't forget that the secrets of magic are 'disappointingly simple' once you figure them out.I will not spell it out for you because that would be wrong, but I will give you one clue: Think about the words, and then think about who he is saying it to.Another clue is the speech given by Angier at the end about the reason he does magic for the audience. This speech also seems out of place unless you realize he is saying it for someone else involved in the movie.I thought the movie rated 7-8 until the last line of the movie clicked into place. Then it became a ten.",10,0,1,7 April 2014
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Iron Man Jr.
","The fact that they rebooted Spider-Man three times in the past 15 years is reason enough to scoff at this latest attempt at making more money off the character. But, although nothing comes close to Raimi's definitive Spider-Man trilogy (yes I liked all three), I was surprised and found this movie somewhat enjoyable and much better than the previous two (The Incredible Spider-Man 1 & 2). Except it has one fatal flaw:I can see what they were trying to do here by converting Spider-Man into a wide-eyed, enthusiastic, but very inexperienced kid. The exact problem is not that he is a dork that makes mistakes and doesn't know what he is doing yet. This aspect has a certain charm to it. The problem is that the writers neutered his powers and replaced them with Iron Man powers.Spider-Man is about amazing spider-like physical skills coupled with a spidey-sense and fast reflexes, coupled with a freaky biological ability to spin webs. This movie kills almost all of that: His physical skills are still there except he somehow finds them useless without Iron Man technology, his spidey-sense is nowhere to be seen, and his biological spider-web thing has been thrown out and replaced with ridiculously impossible sci-fi technology from Stark. And then, after they neuter him like this, they replace all of this with more sci-fi Iron-Man-esque magic-suit capabilites, and then have Iron Man bail him out a few times.I don't understand what they were thinking. Why make a 'Spider-Man' movie only to convert him into a silly 'Iron Man Jr'?",6,1,1,29 November 2018
Pitch Black," Lazy movie makes you feel cheated
","A spaceship with various colorful characters crash-lands on an alien world full of monsters who come out in the dark and try to eat them. Lots of chasing and fighting ensues while tensions rise between a law-enforcement man, a criminal, Muslims on a pilgrimage, and a selfish pilot.That's it for the plot. Being a visually exciting sci-fi action movie from Hollywood, you would expect to be entertained. And you are, but you end up feeling like you just had a very cheap one night-stand.The elements of the story are all inferior copies (extreme dark planet cycles from Nightfall, monsters from Alien, dangerous but helpful outsider from Waterworld), there is never any feeling of an impressive imagination at work or that they sat down to work out the ideas. In other words, a copy-paste quick blockbuster.Beware spoilers: The writing is unforgivably lazy and terribly coincidental: They land on a huge planet right next to a previous colony, they land exactly at the end of a 22 year cycle, they crash land on a hard surface but survive, etc.The monsters never make any sense: They are hyper-sensitive to light but pull a man off the surface in broad daylight, they evolve on a planet that is mostly light but can't stand any light, they have nothing to eat except each other, they fight each other when in flight but somehow live in claustrophobic caverns for years, they attack only the people that the writers want to get rid of, and they give birth to light-emitting babies? And on a personal note, any movie that kills off Claudia Black early is simply stupid.",4,1,5,4 April 2008
Coriolanus," Above-average Shakespeare with flaws
","First, this is Shakespeare and it uses his original dialogue, so anyone that doesn't appreciate the rich language shouldn't be watching this, never-mind reviewing it. I find it sad that so many negative reviews here revolve around the difficult (wonderful) language. If anything, too much of Shakespeare's writing was cut out in order to make the movie shorter, and some scenes and characters suffer because of it.Second, it is transported to a modern setting despite the language, in order to demonstrate its universal themes. Sometimes this works quite well (see Richard III with Loncraine/McKellen). Here, the result is a mixed bag. The modern settings with news-rooms, tanks and trucks work very well, but the war-action scenes sometimes feel shoe-horned in just to try to make Shakespeare more thrilling and pander to audiences, and a key plot element that involves the Roman practice of a hero showing the people his physical wounds in order to gain their trust, doesn't work anymore.The acting is generally good, although the wide range of accents are too distracting, and Azabal chews the scenery and ruins her scenes. The direction is passable.As mentioned, some scenes suffer from too much cutting of dialogue. I found the key scene involving the turning of the crowd against Coriolanus, too awkwardly staccato. Where the original writing had speeches that sway people's emotions, this has abrupt statements and declarations, and many of the characters lose their dimensions as a result.But all these can be overlooked and the movie enjoyed despite these flaws. The one flaw I was not able to overcome is Fiennes characterization of Coriolanus. He portrays him as way too contemptuous and angry, a spiteful man beyond sympathy that basically brought the tragedy on himself. Whereas my impression while reading the play was of a socially awkward, hard, but basically honorable and good man led astray by politics and pressure. Including more of Shakespeare's colorful dialogue and soliloquies could have helped.",7,1,2,29 July 2017
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Epic
","Wow this was sooo cool and I think Scott is a hero to all people who have been called dweebs or dorks before. I mean he beats up all these tough ex-boyfriends with all these super-cool moves in order to win this girl, even though she doesn't really do anything or care about anything except coloring her hair... but that's how girls are I think.And this was such a deep movie I mean look how he even learned such a great lesson at the end of the movie when he apologized for cheating on both of his girlfriends and he got 400 points right away and he even got a self-respect sword! It was so inspiring that I think I will visit the last girlfriend I had 10 years ago in high school and tell her I'm sorry I kissed her best friend from band camp.Update: Well that didn't go so well. She flew up 50 feet into the air and did a back-flip and landed her knee in my groin, and my balls exploded into 100 coins. She flipped me the finger, collected the coins and shut the door in my face.Oh well, at least I can always play some more Street Fighter and Nintendo.",4,3,8,1 December 2013
Avengers: Endgame," A mixed bag
","*spoilers*This final massive movie in the massive MCU franchise reaches an end to the massive buildup after 22 movies, and is also the continuation/ending of the Infinity War movie. Obviously, the makers of this movie were given carte blanche to do whatever they like to the superheroes, since a few were killed off or forever changed in ways that cannot be recovered. I'll leave the plot to the Plot Summary section and review the good and bad elements of the movie (as opposed to the many overly-emotional reviews and votes here that see only black or white):Let's start with the time-travel, since most people seem to be having problems with it and it is the major plot point by which they try to fix what Thanos did in Infinity War. In fact, the writers did an interesting job making use of time-travel without it feeling like a cheat. They simply changed the rules of time-travel used in other movies in order to avoid the usual time paradoxes. This may feel like a cheat to some, but, obviously, nobody can claim to know how time travel could work. And if you pay attention, they stick to their own rules consistently, which is good.Here is the explanation for those that missed it: Timelines can be changed, but when they are changed, they split only for the people involved. I.e. You cannot go back in time and 'fix' the timeline for other people because those people would remain in that alternate timeline that you left behind. You can, however, change the timeline for yourself, and the past/future all proceed in the order by which you experience/d it. You can also change the timeline for the people in the past, but, once again, that would not affect the timeline that you left behind in the future.So, to make this clearer with examples, there are at least three timelines for the people in this movie: 1. The one we know according to the superheroes where Thanos wiped out 50% of all life. 2. The timeline for Thanos himself (and his friends) that has now been changed when he jumped forward in time. He didn't wipe out 50% in his timeline and he changed his mind and wanted to wipe out ALL of life this time after he saw how ineffective it was in one possible future. 3. The alternate timeline by the people in the past after Thanos jumped forward. Their timeline split and they experienced no Thanos!There is no problem with changing timelines. The only problem is that they needed to fix their own (#1) for the rest of the world, and going back in time would not do that. They needed to bring something from the past (the stones) in order fix the present timeline for everyone. The only reason Captain America had to go back to return the stones was so that alternate timeline #3 would not be wiped out without the stones. While he was there, he stayed there, which basically created his own personal alternate timeline that followed #1 with #3. All clear now?This new method of timelines achieves something important: It doesn't cheat by going back in time and undoing/changing it. It forces them to be creative and to do something in THIS timeline in order to fix the problem. Thus avoiding the typical cheat of time-travel.Now for the rest:Killing off Black Widow, Iron Man and Captain America (technically he wasn't killed but he lived his whole life elsewhere so he can't continue here and now in a sequel in this timeline so it's the same thing..): This was actually very good and brave. I wish they had done this sooner, then the superheros would actually feel more vulnerable and human. Iron Man gets a strong ending to his character arc and a touching send-off. Cap also gets strong character development here.The mixing of so many superheroes in one movie is bad for several reasons. First of all, it's like mixing fifty of your favorite foods together. They work nicely alone, but together, it becomes an overblown mess that doesn't work. Second, not all superheroes are fun for everyone. So mixing foods you do not like together with the good ones, will simply ruin the whole salad. Third, even with three hours, many of them are neglected.Hulk is ruined. Someone very misguided thought it would be clever to mix Banner and Hulk into one person. Except that the whole fun of Hulk was his uncontrolled fury and his split personality.Thanos became too powerful in this movie. I agree with this complaint. This is inconsistent with what we saw earlier.Captain Marvel has got to be the worst character by far in the MCU. Her personality has all the charm of an angry gnat, her obnoxious feminist attitude is toxic, and her super-powers are so badly defined, they can do anything and everything as needed. Unlimited and/or undefined super-powers are boring and are guaranteed to ruin any super-hero movie (which is why I also dislike Superman). Her presence in this movie almost ruins it completely but thankfully they used her as little as possible (probably because they realized how ridiculous her powers are). Most of the stars I removed were because of this character.They have increasingly made Thor into  the point of ridiculousness in a series of movies. And in this movie he has reached a peak of silly uselessness. It is kinda funny though so I don't hate it. But Thor fans will not be pleased.The final fight is a massive spectacle on one end, but so overblown and full of CGI it makes me yearn for the simpler superhero movies. The inclusion of the whole universe simply isn't as relatable as a local problem in one city. It's just too much. I enjoyed earlier simpler super-hero movies much more than this one.In summary: A mixed bag. It's good that they finally put an end to this overblown series of movies that have gone out of control. It's not anything close to a classic in my book, but it's difficult to ignore since it concludes the series and it does have lots of fun stuff despite its flaws.",6,0,4,9 August 2019
District 9," Overrated, but an entertaining one-time watch
","I'll skip the plot this time and just summarize the pros and cons:Pros: Great seamless special effects. They're done so naturally and shown so offhandedly, that they really look & feel like part of the mockumentary in the beginning of the movie.A good imagination with the aliens, weapons, ships and technology.Several entertaining scenes, with lots of humor and action (except that the blend of these different approaches don't work well with each other - see below).Cons: The movie can't make up its mind about its approach and type of entertainment. First it's a really silly mockumentary that revels in awkward Office-like humor (which also happens to be a genre I don't enjoy) with a dumb bureaucrat trying to handle the moving of very wild aliens. Then there's the more serious sci-fi elements and drama that clashes with the silly approach. Then there's action-scenes for a shoot-em-up ending.The aliens never make sense. They have superior weaponry but allow themselves to be subdued with only a few violent fits, they are extremely dumb, except for one fellow for no particular reason. It's like dogs suddenly invented space travel and weapons - it never makes sense.The movie wants to draw parallels with apartheid and whatnot, but the aliens are so violent, animalistic and disrespectful in their behaviour, it's impossible to sympathize with them.Character development is a mess: We get a bureaucrat who gleefully 'pops' baby aliens, then he is forced to live with them when he starts mutating but still stays a bureaucratic jerk, and he only helps them when he realizes he needs them to save his own skin, killing his own brainlessly violent co-workers for selfish reasons. Not exactly satisfying. And yet it seems the movie wants us to sympathize.Given the above, and the fact that the police also are so cartoonishly fascist and violent, there is no side to take with this movie and nobody that is likable.Therefore, this is a one-time watch only.",6,0,0,6 January 2016
Get Out," Vastly overrated
","This movie seems to have gone viral and has gotten an inordinate amount of views and praises, and there is indeed a lot to like, especially in its atmosphere, some little horror details, and how it was filmed in old-school style, but in the end it is just another sloppily written brainless modern movie with huge plot holes.It is also unoriginal and predictable. It is basically a black version of The Stepford Wives with an added twist.A black guy and his white girlfriend go to meet her family, and gradually uncover very strange goings on, especially with the very bizarre and creepy behaviour by the black people working for the family.*spoilers* First there is the idiotic and obviously ego-driven concept that all white people in this movie worship the black physique enough to want a black body for themselves. I'm sure I don't have to point out how this is untrue and awkwardly egotistical on the part of the film-maker, not to mention the well known statistic that black people have a much higher number of health problems. On top of that, this movie drives the point once again of how badly black people are treated in society, so why on earth would a white person want to become one according to its own logic? Then there's the head-scratching plot point where they transplanted their grandma and grandpa into black people's bodies, except they turned them into brainwashed slaves. Obviously someone switched plots midway through the movie and didn't think things through...These aren't just plot holes, they kill the whole backbone of the movie.Not to mention the happy ending that is in denial. The very next day, obviously he would be arrested for mass murder.P.S. Those of you blindly repeating the complaint about the cotton and how he managed to get it in his ears... This is actually NOT a plot hole. His hands were tied, but his head and upper body clearly weren't and he even visibly bent down towards the cotton at the end of the scene.",5,15,27,15 July 2017
Kick-Ass," What's wrong?
","(This will be food for thought for people that watched it, and not a proper review) I really want to enjoy this movie more, and, in some scenes, the movie actually is great, but it just doesn't work as a whole. Like most people, I thought 'Hit-Girl' stole the movie and found her character great fun... at first.Ebert felt the problem is that this character of an ultra-violent 11 year old girl, trained by her revenge-obsessed dad, that kills dozens of men without blinking an eye, is immoral and sad. Sure, this is true, but only if her character was presented as something to take seriously. And that's exactly what this movie did, unintentionally. Because it made her way too cool, because Chloe was simply too good at making her charming and real, and most of all, because her relationship with her dad and her climactic battle, took an all-too-serious turn.See, you can't go for campy fun, then demand that the audience invest their emotions in a character that is supposed to be a parody, or an over-the-top fun cartoon character. Imagine if Wile E. Coyote was suddenly shown to be a desperate dad trying to bring home food to his dying daughter. What would that do to the Road Runner cartoons? Those cartoons feature ultra-violence and kids watch them all the time, but they don't feel objectionable (at least to some people), because of the point I'm trying to make.Another way of saying this, is what other people said: This movie is too inconsistent in tone. Hit-Girl and her dad are a kick-ass fun duo, but then they are suddenly involved in a very dramatic, painful and sad death scene. The movie starts with a teenager who hopelessly wants to be a super-hero and fails realistically, but then shifts to an unrealistic 11-year-old super-fighter. All these approaches conflict with each other, which is why it doesn't work, and which is why I think Ebert was disturbed by a character that was supposed to be silly fun.Also, both the characters and the events keep veering from realistic to cartoonish. One minute the guy is stabbed by simple street thugs and having sloppy street-brawls realistically, the next, his steel implants after a near-fatal accident make him stronger instead of weaker, and he is flying new untested gadgets in seconds and having elaborate stick-fights. Is this movie about nerds that want to be super heroes, or about nerds that get their wish fulfilled in some kind of alternate fun reality? Either one of these ideas would work, but not both! Make up your minds!And then there's her swearing: I'm not against swearing in movies, but when the writers make her character swear for no reason whatsoever just because she is an 11 year old girl, and when, if you think about it, it wouldn't make sense that her dad would condone or encourage such swearing, it turns the movie into juvenile trash written by writers who would rather insert a juvenile joke into the movie than focus on what they are trying to achieve.",5,1,3,26 April 2016
Eyes Wide Shut," Maddeningly intriguing - it has staying power even if you don't like it
","Like most Kubrick movies, a very unique experience whether you like it or not. My personal opinion of this movie is constantly wavering for years now. Even while I re-watch it, I find myself not liking certain aspects of it, but unable to let it go.Cruise and Kidman, once a couple in real life, act as a couple that has reached a crisis. The crisis involves sex and the issue of sexual fantasies and their dangerous and ignored place in a marriage.It attacks immaturity and the act of burying your head in the sand when it comes to other people's human frailties, flaws and fantasies while accepting your own. Hence the title.Dr. William Harford (Cruise) is a typically naive young husband who thinks a woman, and especially his wife, is faithful because she requires love and stability in a relationship. He flirts at parties, seems faithful, but also seems to be oblivious to the dangers and hypocrisies of his fantasies and the way he sees women.When he fails to show jealousy over a suave man that hits on his wife, she brutally crushes his naiveté by telling him of a time where she was willing to leave him for a fling with a sailor. Although it is an aggressive and rude confession, it's easy to overlook her admissions of fear and conflicting feelings for him, and her message to him, which she does a bad job of conveying, is clear once you think about it with mature sensitivity.(spoilers) He then wanders through the city, staggering with the implications and unpleasant images that this confession triggers, and is so outraged, angry and confused, that he tentatively pushes his flirtations and fantasies a few steps further. This night of strange sexual encounters is almost surreal, with people hitting on him for the strangest reasons, coming close to infidelity with a sweet hooker, all leading to the notorious cult-orgy scene.And then comes the day-after, full of disappointing realism, daylight, and scary repercussions. He finds out how dangerous his encounters could have been. There is a death which may or may not have been caused by his naiveté. There is a plausible explanation, but is it really plausible? The movie doesn't answer this question. It leaves us hanging with our own imaginations, like a fantasy. Instead, it is back to reality for the couple, only this time their eyes are opened to their flaws and responsibilities and possible choices.Given the above way of looking at this movie, her last line becomes clearer. It is a crude awakening that sex is not always a romantic, or harmless fantasy, and that adults don't just make love to their wives, but *uck as well.On the other hand, the movie may just be saying that humans are led by their animalistic drives regardless of dangerous consequences, and it's time to wake up to this fact and accept it the way it is. It doesn't explicitly raise the issue of making responsible choices. That's the kind of movie this is: Ambiguous, but thought-provoking.It is not really an erotic movie. Kidman's nudity in the beginning of the movie is just as engineered as the rest of the movie: She starts as a sex object and a mother, gives us a strange, mysterious look in the mirror, then forcibly becomes a sexual person with flaws and immoral sexual fantasies of her own.There was much hullabaloo over the cult-orgy scene and what it did or didn't show, but whether genitalia was shown or not is irrelevant. I found the whole scene ridiculous and mechanical until I realized that it is exactly the effect it was going for and that it needs to be taken as a surreality, and is only there to involve the audience in a fantasy experience detached from reality and a tangible eroticism, and with unexpected, unknown dangers.Besides the ridiculous orgy, another flaw is Kubrick's ability to drain some scenes of their blood, drawn out with overly-pregnant pauses and slow pacing, possibly due to his famously pedantic multiple takes. But, in some cases, this helps the atmosphere and gives you time to absorb the scene.This movie is a lot of things. It is an art-house movie about sex for adults. It is a horror-thriller for men in a unique sense of the genre. It is definitely a thought-provoking movie. It doesn't seem to appeal to female audiences as much as men though, but perhaps this review will help appreciate it a bit more.I may have explained too much for a movie that wants to be open-ended and provocative. But if nothing else, I wrote this for myself to try to organize my thoughts and figure out why it glued itself to my mind so.",8,6,11,2 March 2013
Hancock," Great first half, ruined by second half
","(Will warn when I get to the spoilers...) The concept is superb: A superhero who acts like a bum and causes just as much damage as he does good, making the whole world hate him, yet he feels compelled to continue saving lives. What's more, Will Smith gives this character depth in a superb acting job, instead of just making him a cartoon character.The first half sets up this character with just the right amount of comedy, and has him meet a PR guy who wants to help him improve his public image and himself as a person, leading to some great comedy.(Major spoilers follow) Then comes the second half that ruins everything. It's not that the second half switches into a different movie. It's that the writers seemed to have been drinking all of the bottles that Hancock left behind, and stopped making any sense whatsoever.First of all, if he was a superhero for 3000 years before they found him in a hospital, then obviously the world knows who he is, so why did no one know him and tell him who he was?! And why would he and his doctors think he became a superhero only after his hospital stay? I don't believe they missed this obvious point. This alone kills the whole setup.Second, if they become mortal every time he gets close to her, why didn't he feel anything during their first long family dinner together? Or worse: When they fought, why didn't they kill each other or cause any damage to each other? According to the ending, all he has to do is put a mere kilometer of distance between them to become immortal again, so obviously it's the distance alone that causes it, contradicting everything that happened before.And what's the deal with the popcorn and tornadoes? Anyone? They get a triple-tornado when they get together and yet they stayed together several times before according to her, and the world didn't notice? And then there's her character. It's like they used a different writer for each segment of the movie. She transitions from normal person to super-bitch, to crazy person who enjoys wrecking the city for no reason, who then claims to be stronger than him just for the feminists in the crowd (and yet the world forgot everything she did for 3000 years?), and finally to a self-sacrificing saint. I kept praying that the movie would switch back to the Hancock character and save itself, but it never did. Huge disappointment. If only they had focused exclusively on his slower transition as a character...",5,0,2,22 January 2016
Arrival," Ending ruins smart sci-fi movie
","Most of this opinion 'review' will contain major spoilers about the ending.This is the kind of sci-fi I really like: Intelligent, challenging, with an exploration of big themes on humanity via a sci-fi element or a tweak to reality.The themes are about language changing the way people think, rather than vice-versa, and it's about a very special tool/weapon that aliens bring to humanity. The story is about a language expert brought to try to communicate with the aliens via their very challenging alien form of language.At first her methods look really sloppy and dumb, as she assumes that pointing to herself with a name card will communicate anything concrete and unambiguous, and that aliens have names. But it improves greatly after that.The majority of the movie is very interesting and well done, including the cinematography, sound and effects. It's the ending that ruins everything.She discovers that their weapon is really the gift of their language, which constructs sentences and concepts instantly without regard for the sequence of events. Thus, by really learning and practicing this language, the human mind gets re-wired and can actually rise above time and see the future. They give this to humanity in a way that will bring them together and cooperate, because they saw a future where the humans will help them in return. And then they leave with their mission accomplished.Which is all very well and interesting, except that what do you think the military and governments that were all ready to kill each other throughout this movie, will do with the super-weapon of seeing the future? And what would the military do with people who can or have developed this ability? Which is why the whole ending stinks and reeks of bleeding-heart, simplistic, childish naivete.A belligerent Chinese general changes his mind just because she told him his wife's dying words, when obviously the only thing he would have assumed would be that someone bugged the room he was in. And even if he believed that she did it because she saw the future, his first priority would be to kill such a dangerous threat! The movie hints that perhaps she is the only one that developed this ability because of her gift with languages and she used it for the good of mankind. Which is impossible to believe. As if the governments wouldn't put thousands of people on it to try to acquire the gift and use it for themselves. And even if they didn't succeed, obviously they wouldn't let her go free, and rival governments would want to kidnap or kill her. But no, this movie wants you to believe that suddenly humanity became peaceful just because someone can see the future. What an unfortunately silly ending.",6,3,7,27 February 2017
The Cabin in the Woods," Sloppy waste of potential
","I usually love Whedon's material, and this meta-horror movie definitely had some good ideas and great potential, but ultimately it disappoints. The sloppiness of the writing simply makes it hard to enjoy.The good stuff is the scattered snippets of Whedon's snappy dialog, and the concept.Spoilers follow.The bad stuff is exemplified by the puff of smoke that makes one character suddenly change his mind, and say the exact thing that they wanted him to say. I mean, I can tolerate the sci-fi approach where they somehow built a huge Truman-like enclosure and somehow invented the technology for an invisible barrier. But brain control that makes people think and say exact illogical things with a puff of smoke, is way too much.And this is the kind of thing I hate with bad sci-fi and fantasy writing: If you are going to invent a superpower or super-technology, don't make believe that it doesn't exist when it isn't convenient. Why didn't they use that puff of smoke to stop them from driving away into the tunnel instead of rushing to blow it up? Or use it to stop them from going into the elevator? Or from killing zombies? And why not make them run into the monster's hands for that matter? Evidently they don't care about freewill after they chose the monster, since they used the puff of smoke. Not to mention that they made most of the characters so dumb that they would ignore things like cellar doors opening by themselves and tunnels blowing up.And what kind of stupid monster facility has a big red button available to guests that brings ALL of the monsters into the facility and frees them? That's really dumb. And why didn't the monsters attack each other? There are several more examples like these of lazy writing that insult the audience.Other flaws include many bland or nonsensical characters in the facility (no one seemed to be bothered by the fact that they are killing people even if it's for the greater good), and there's the weird redneck character that never made any sense (biblical preaching over the phone but afraid of being heard over speaker-phone? why?), all of which makes it impossible to tune into what they were about.And then there are the various rules on how to kill their sacrifices. Obviously, all of the rules are just there so that they will conform to horror movie clichés. But it isn't clever to simply invent a 'system' that conforms to horror clichés if they don't give any reasons why these rules are there! In short, the concept in the movie feels very undeveloped and the writing is too sloppy. Good idea, a moderately entertaining movie, but a poor execution.",5,2,2,2 October 2015
