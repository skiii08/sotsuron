The Devil's Advocate," 2.5 Stars
","Above average thriller staring the devil (Pacino) and his chosen servant (Reeves).  Director Hackford brings us a unique twist in a favorite story, but fails to convince with suspicious ending.  Pacino carries every scene his in, and Reeves has never been better (which might not be saying much).",6,0,1,21 December 2000
The Big Lebowski," 3.5 Stars
","Hilariously funny film brought to us by the Coen brothers.  Centering around 'the Dude' (Bridges), it consists of a series of side-busting sequences involving his bowling friends (Goodman and Buscemi), narcisists, another Lebowski, and the other Lebowski's evil daughter.  Succeeds in comedy where 'Fargo' largely fails.  Great timely acting and a good feel for the random.",8,0,1,20 December 2000
Memento," 4 out of 5 stars
","Inventive, unique, engaging film about a man with short-term memory loss trying to piece together and avenge his wife's rape and murder.  Told backwards, this film makes us feel the confusion, delusion, and frustration of the main character (Guy Pearce) as he tries to determine who he can trust and where to go next.  Pearce is on screen for every scene, and he delivers a strong performance, both chilling and inspirational at the same time. Director Nolan also hits us with a subliminal message about the ultimate futility of revenge and the human desire to make sense of the world around us.  In the end, this film's creative style and backwards motion carry it high above an otherwise everyday noir plot.  Never loses its focus and keeps you thinking well after the credits role-for better or worse.",7,0,1,23 January 2002
Billy Elliot," 3.5 out of 5 stars
","England in the 1980s was the time of Margaret Thatcher, labor unrest, and the political shouting matches-not dancing.  This does little to stop Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), the son and brother of two striking coal miners in a working class town in northern England.  Not cut out for the boxing his father has signed him up for, Elliot realizes he has a special talent for dance and joins a ballet group at the local gym.  Being the only boy in the class and the only male ballet student in town does not bother Billy, but it does bother his macho father (Gary Lewis), who is dealing with the loss of his wife and the downtrodden existence of mining.  While most around him equate dancing with homosexuality, Billy persists in his desire to dance, spurned along by the local dance teacher (Julie Waters) and a desire to make it out of his poor mining town into the Royal Ballet School.  `Billy Elliot' overcomes a slow, formulaic start to provide an inspirational tale about determination and doing what you love.  While some of the characters are given short shrift, Elliot is a wonderfully developed young boy with a talent no one gives him credit for.  It brings some laughs but is more correctly described as an important fable on the pursuit of dreams.",6,0,1,2 February 2002
L.A. Confidential," 2 Stars
","Stylistic recreation of L.A.-based noir pictures of past years.  Struggles under weight of complex, character-driven plot.  Excels in strong performances by Crowe, DeVito, and Basinger.  Overall, however, given too much credit for a genre that has been better addressed in 'Chinatown' among others.  Basinger won Oscar for Best Supporting Actress.",8,1,2,20 December 2000
American Psycho," 1.5 Stars
","Gruesome, unredeeming thriller of a young, egotistical, brash businessman who poses as a serial killer in his free time.  Meant to be a scathing critique of 1980s male business culture but ends up looking more like a lame 'Saturday Night Live' skit.  Bale, in lead role, is over-the-top and ridiculous; tries to be Tom Cruise instead of character in the movie.  This is a film that had promise only to get bogged down in stupidity.",4,1,2,21 December 2000
Face_Off," 2 Stars
","Decent John Woo film about two men, one good and one evil, who switch faces through cosmetic surgery and assume each others lives.  One of Woo's first Hollywood-made films, it doesn't reach the artistic and authenticity of his Chinese action films.  Creative performances by Cage and Travolta save this from being poor.",Null,0,0,20 December 2000
Driven," 2.5 out of 5 stars
","In the first big-budget, Hollywood stab at car racing since `Days of Thunder,' we are given an ESPN-like montage more suitable for SportsCenter than your local multiplex.  Joe Tanto (Sylvester Stallone), a veteran driver with several skeletons in his closet, is brought back to racing by a handicapped, but still shrewd, racing manager (Burt Reynolds) in order to coach a young star (Kip Pardue) to superstardom.  His assignment: teach the kid how to handle the pressures of racing so he can overcome the erstwhile German champion, Beau Brandenburg (Til Schweiger).  Director Renny Harlin gives us a film that is more Hollywood than Daytona: drivers with playboy looks, beautiful women switching sides like WWF sidekicks, and an endless web of soap opera love stories and past feuds.  Shot in a Bruckheimer-like vision of constantly moving cameras and endless jump cuts, the film is a series of car crashes linked together by short, meaningless conversations and annoying broadcast overplays.  Despite all this, for some reason I wanted to like this film, and, in the end, I did not hate it.  Maybe because it allowed itself the break the rules (with a super-ridiculous higher-than-high speed car chase through downtown Chicago) and play with melodrama (with a sexless love-triangle straight out of the 5th grade). Like car racing itself, the entertainment value is higher than any other remotely redeeming quality.",5,0,1,5 February 2002
Bring It On," 1.5 out of 5 stars
","It is doubtful that too many serious cheerleaders enjoyed this one. Revolving around a growing rivalry between an all-white cheerleading squad from a San Diego suburb and an all-black inner-city squad (apparently before desegregation and school busing programs were introduced?), this film makes cheerleaders, and their sport, look dumber than deserved.  Dunst gives an energetic and hard-working performance as the head cheerleader for the all-white squad, and her battle with the ethics of cheerleading is about the only thing that rings true.  The all-black squad (led by Gabrielle Union, who makes the most of a tough situation) is given a fraction of the screen time, reflecting the view in Hollywood that white people are simply more interesting and more deserving to be the focus of most major commercial films.  Plays into every stereotype concerning gender, sexual preference, hair color, race, and athletics; this is not one to bring impressionable kids to.",3,1,2,19 January 2002
The Shawshank Redemption," 4 Stars
","Excellent, powerful drama about two mens' friendship and escape from Shawshank prison.  Robbins and Freeman excel in perfect roles.  Sharp script and touching subplots add to this enduring film.  Freeman's narration illuminates beauty and power of Stephen King short story upon which it is based.  Directed by Frank Darabont ('The Green Mile').",7,0,0,20 December 2000
Blow," 3 out of 5 stars
","This is the MTV version of `Traffic,' the most recent lucid film on America's drug problem.  It follows the rise of Massachusetts-bred George Jung (Johnny Depp) from the working class suburbs of Boston to the live-free beaches of California.  Jung gets started shipping marijuana between Mexico and California, but, after a quick stint in prison, moves on to the more lucrative business of cocaine shipments from Colombia.  Directed Ted Demme (now deceased, probably from drugs) would have us believe that Jung initiated the entire drug trade between Latin America and the United States, starting in the early 1970s.  Disregarding this unlikelihood for the moment still leaves us with a film too intent on being cool and hip to take a critical stance on a man that can be criticized (for his greed, cockiness, and irresponsibility) from here to kingdom come.  Whereas `Traffic' took a very broad, sweeping stab at analyzing the war on drugs, `Blow' is too content focusing on one very uninspiring man and the ways he fell into a very lucrative, and damaging, business.  Depp is good playing the sorry Jung, but Demme does not give any of his actors enough to develop here.",6,0,0,2 February 2002
Shrek," 2.5 stars
","Excellent, cutting edge computer animation is somewhat dulled by a been-there, done-that plot in this film about an ugly ogre (voiced by Mike Myers) and his adventures to save a beautiful princess (voiced by Cameron Diaz).  Eddie Murphy, as the voice for the ogre's donkey sidekick, steals the movie and most of its laughs; Diaz terribly miscast as the voice of an appealing princess.  Film most clever in its satire on past animated movies, most notably of the Disney brand name.",6,0,3,3 June 2001
The Truman Show," 3.5 Stars
","Wonderful, imaginative film by Weir which focuses on Truman (Carrey), a man who has unknowingly lived his entire life as the star of a television show. The film covers his self-realization and delves most creatively into the religious parallels of his life and ours.  Carrey and supporting cast are excellent.  Weir shows a new creative style of filmmaking.",6,0,0,20 December 2000
