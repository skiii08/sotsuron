Hereditary," Flooring.
","Do you know that loose-carpet runner in the living room, or that squeaky cupboard door in the kitchen, or in fact any mundane little chore you can think of. do that, do that before you even ever consider wasting two precious hours of your life on this ridiculous piece of cinematic rubbish. How dare anyone request money for the privilege of sitting through this. Absolutely dreadful, I cannot express enough how awful this was. If you've ever enjoyed a horror film then I this isn't for you, or if you've ever even seen a film. If I've ever meant anything to you at all then please avoid this movie.",1,0,5,25 August 2018
