Child 44," There's no such thing as murder in paradise
","Ostensibly a crime thriller, this film is really a portrayal of what life is like in a totalitarian state, with the 'great leader' telling everyone they live in paradise and forcing them all to agree if they don't want to be persecuted. The result is generalised fear and a perfect breeding ground for cowardly monsters. Fortunately, there are always some with the character and courage to resist.
The acting is perfect, making the film feel very real (if one can ignore the fact that all the Russians are speaking heavily accented English - but to be fair, what sort of a cinema audience would one attract with a film in Russian with English subtitles; it is a business looking for a market, after all).",6,0,0,18 May 2018
Deepwater Horizon," Above all, a tribute to the 11 men who lost their lives
","The film makers wisely focus their main effort on portraying the very real dangers involved in the offshore E&P business (even down to bird strikes that can play havoc with equipment) and how things can so easily go wrong, risking the lives of the people at the front end.
Unfortunately, they did fall into the trap of following the US business and government narrative at the time, throwing all the blame onto a foreign oil company that was making serious inroads into 'their' business. While not wishing to excuse BP from their significant responsibility, subsequent investigations have shown culpability in the series of errors that led to the disaster to be shared among a number of companies involved, most of them American.
Nevertheless, since the film mainly follows the technical complexity of the operations taking place and reactions under the severest stress, it is an action movie that stands as an effective tribute to those 11 men who died so tragically, as well as the heroism and professional competence of many of those who survived.
My main spoiler is to point out that the Wahlberg character, while representing a specific individual, actually incorporated several individuals on the platform and is shown doing numerous things that were actually done by others. Why can't Hollywood just recognise the heroism in most people, working together as a team, instead of concentrating it into a single superhero? This is supposed to be a 'real-world' event, after all!",7,0,1,25 April 2018
Pirate Radio," Rollicking good fun
","This film must have one of the best soundtracks of all time!
I was a teenager living through those times, tuning in to Caroline, Luxembourg and others, so I found it a faithful reflection of the spirit of the pirate radio phenomenon, if not actually adhering strictly to the facts.
I have a lot of sympathy for my parents' generation, as the transition was fast and brutal. We used to listen to classical music, the crooners and of course the wonderful radio comedy served up by the Goons, Tommy Handley, Round the Horn, etc. The opening to 'Listen With Mother' struck an immediate chord - they were gentle relief in a world recovering from the consecutive cataclysms of world war.
Then suddenly we got rock'n'roll, then pop, then progressive rock. The best was still extremely melodic, but the speed and sound volume were turned up sharply.
But it wasn't just the music. Swearing, pre-marital sex (WWII had helped to spread those) and a certain amount of anarchy and disrespect for any kind of authority also proliferated. It was a lot for adults brought up on self-discipline and politeness to take in.
Unlike the film, the government of the time was the Labour Party (history has shown that 'parties of the workers' have a greater tendency towards totalitarian control than conservatives). And the opening up of the radio waves - bear in mind we'd only recently come out of wartime censorship - did occur, by popular demand, without any pirate ships sinking. We can thank pirate radio for that!
So just immerse yourself in the spirit of the times, a marvelous soundtrack and some very funny moments aboard The Boat That Rocked!",7,1,1,2 May 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," A new lease of life for the series
","Although I actually prefer the first two films I have to give credit to this really fun film for having given the entire Thor franchise a new lease of life. Thor's romantic relationship with Jane has run its course and other baggage that limited where the stories could go has been cut away. And crucially, the writers have gone for a strong dose of humour that is thankfully more along the lines of the Avengers and Iron Man franchises (rather than the pre-adolescent level that weakened Guardians 1 and sunk Guardians 2). After all, if the franchise is to be free to follow potentially preposterous directions, it's essential to lace it all with humour that keeps the ball rolling and doesn't take itself too seriously - which I gather spoiled some people's full enjoyment of the first two in the series.",7,0,3,10 March 2018
The Flowers of War," Prepare for streaming eyes at the end
","... but hopefully also inspired by what you have seen.
I am definitely not a Christian Bale fan, as I dislike most of his characterisations, but he can rise to the heights sometimes (as in 'The Big Short'). Here he starts out in typical American capitalist mode, seeking to take advantage from the situation he finds himself in.
But war has an interesting effect on people. It tends to bring out the best and worst in us. And although we see plenty of the worst, mainly from the Japanese invaders, this film is mainly about the best, often deriving from unlikely sources.
The pivot is a group of terrified young girls at a Nanking religious school who have been left (by the death of the priest) under the care of an equally young and scared orphan boy who takes his responsibility extremely seriously (a wonderful performance by Kefan Cao).
They are joined by a group of young prostitutes from a local brothel who suspect what their fate will be if the Japanese find them (borne out later when 2 girls unwisely return to the brothel to pick up a couple of items). There is a standout performance from their leading figure (played by Ni Ni), who understandably captivates the Christian Bale character. 
I won't spoil it by giving more details, but the desire to save the children leads everyone to risk their lives, in the knowledge that if they die they will do so with dignity and in a good cause.
PS: the fact that a German nazi party member (John Rabe) became a Chinese hero through his efforts to prevent Japanese attrocities in China tells you just how bad it got and the time is really long overdue for Japan to follow the German path to redemption by recognising the horrors committed, seeking forgiveness and ceasing to pay homage to the leaders who led them down that awful path. There is no honour in refusing to admit that one's compatriots can be monsters too and such a stance is totally incompatible with Japan's civilized attitude in so many other areas. Indeed it is the one obstacle preventing worldwide admiration of the Japanese for the qualities they possess.",8,2,2,22 June 2018
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Action fun that doesn't take itself too seriously
","I enjoyed this film and look forward to sequels with the same leads. Renner and Atterton get their parts just right. When you're dealing with witch hunting and using very modern upgrades on the weaponry of the time I think violence is going to be inevitable, but it isn't of the sadistic kind shown by Tarrantino. What could be reduced is the swearing. Both Renner and Atterton coming separately upon the original gingerbread house where the baddie has taken refuge and both saying 'You've gotta be kidding' is funny and doesn't need 'fucking' inserted there. Sometimes it was appropriate, but more often it was dispensable - and why limit your audience by alienating people who are fine with violence but don't like gratuitous swearing?",6,1,1,24 February 2018
Dunkirk," Looked and felt like a shoestring budget
","There's only so much mileage one can get out of half a dozen aircraft filmed from all different angles but repeating the same stuff over and over again. If those precious relics weren't capable of safely doing their stuff then I can't think of a better justification for special effects.
Indeed I find myself in full agreement with others who lament how this film totally failed to do justice to the magnificent scale of the achievement of withdrawing well over 300,000 troops from that beach in a matter of days, while under fire. This wasn't DUNKIRK, it was personal glimpses of Dunkirk by some of the people who participated in the evacuation.
My suggestion would be to recut the film to show the intimacy of the different situations portrayed and reissue it under the title 'Personal Stories From The Dunkirk Evacuation'. Then it might be more appreciated and avoid the deserved backlash over the very false banner it was released under.",6,1,2,20 April 2018
Captain America: Civil War," An exciting action pic, but...
","...the underlying theme is the clash between American exceptionalism (we know best and we'll do what we want, when and where we want) and, on the other side, responsibility to the people and the rule of law, both nationally and internationally. And unfortunately the writers appear to have opted for the plot to make the former appear to be the correct attitude, in compliance with the US Republican Party agenda. I believe that is why so many people were profoundly disappointed with this film, despite the opportunity to see their favourite superheroes in action again.
It actually started out on a positive note, reminding people that combating the bad guys should try to take into consideration the citizens they're there to protect and to avoid all the mayhem that has so far been written off as unfortunate collateral damage (too bad, sniff, tear). Remember how Hancock was told: you can't go around doing things like that! And the last time 'that' meant a city being dropped from a considerable height.
Not only does that sort of thing cause serious loss of life - remember the role to 'protect humanity', not spin another sequel (if these films are to have any relevance to humanity beyond simple escapism) - but it also has other consequences, like sparking resentment and a desire for revenge. And that is ostensibly the subject of this exciting episode. But then there's that nasty subplot...",7,1,2,17 July 2018
Toy Story 4," The franchise just keeps getting better!
","I found the 3rd film very moving, but this 4th edition is beautiful in its consistent kindness - but not in a sloppy sentimental way. Even the apparent villain in this one has a moving story that brings everyone closer together in the end. There are no sadistic kids or malevolent toys, yet there is still plenty of exciting action and also a genuine deep emotional connection that takes the audience to another level. If you can sustain this quality Disney/Pixar then keep the sequels coming!",8,0,1,20 December 2019
The Favourite," An absolute travesty!
","The film does not so much distort as completely rewrite history, all for the sake of pandering to 21st century prejudice and titillation. That this was a very important yet little known period of European history most worthy of examination makes this farce a cinematic tragedy.
It gets 3 stars only because Wiesz and Stone turned in good performances with what they'd been given, which yielded a few clever bits of dialogue.
I cannot say the same of the simpering whimpering Olivia Colman, who deserves to be sued for her vaudeville representation of Queen Anne. Though I suppose she cannot be blamed for the fictional rabbit collection nor the invented lesbian relationships, much less the total omission of her devoted husband from the film.",3,6,13,12 February 2019
Get Out," A comedy, not a horror film
","As a comedic satire of AfroAmericans' worst nightmares and fantasies about white people, this film is very funny, especially as our hero is so trusting that he consistently ignores his bff's dire warnings along the path to ruin. That the decrepit white monsters show a preference for virile young black people adds to the humour. 
However, having discovered that this is apparently meant to be a serious horror film cum social commentary I can only give it a thumbs down.
Our leads are both endearing, until we learn the awful truth about her and her family. But everybody else is so absurdly weird (even the bff) that there is no room for belief that this has anything to do with the real world (unless perhaps a real world as reflected in the film Deliverance). 
There is more one can relate to in the films about vampires trying to perpetuate their existence by possessing new bodies full of youthful vitality - which is effectively the same plot but doesn't try to make a racial issue out of it. I am appalled by the potential impact on interracial relations for anybody who takes this film the slightest bit seriously. But for those who can laugh out loud at it there is still hope.",4,1,1,19 July 2018
Call Me by Your Name," What a load of codswallop!
","It's nice that Helio has a clearly affectionate and intellectually stimulating family, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this film.Try changing the roles and having an attractive adult male made welcome in your home and enjoying your hospitality while he proceeds to take advantage of the situation to seduce your confused teenage daughter as she tries to cope with her rampant puberty. That a son cannot get pregnant doesn't make it okay!That the father is okay with this (turns out he's a closet gay) goes a long way to explaining the current backlash against a PC liberalism in which apparently anything goes and ours is the failing if we cannot comprehend. I'm sorry, but a healthy society has standards to live up to and there are limits to tolerance, such as the good reasons why sex with parents, children, siblings, grandparents, and pets is a no-no, however much you may love them. Because loving someone means putting their interests before your own, not having sex with them!As a hetero I know how great sex is within a relationship of shared love. However, that does not make me homophobic, as I have a number of friends who happen to be gay, but I find it disturbing the way we are supposed to embrace homosexuality as the new norm - we mustn't let a sexual preference define us as people!What we should be embracing is LOVE, and that is something that has no gender basis whatsoever. But this film is not about love, it's about sex - which is frequently and grossly treated as a synonym, with the tragic consequences we see all around us. If it was about love, Oliver would not have phoned Helio at the end, on the eve of his wedding - he'd have had more consideration for the boy's feelings. The film merely reinforces the notion that gays and bisexuals are promiscuous and will take sex wherever and whenever they can get it.If we are going to have homosexuality constantly rammed down our throats by the media, let's see the couples that are faithful to one another and have stable relationships that are based on real love and deserve all the civil rights pertaining to any other stable civil relationship (leave religions out of this - they have their own rules, which should be respected as long as no harm is done). Those are the portrayals that are going to convince the antis to give homosexuals the same respect as they would anybody else, not the ones that portray homosexuals as sexual predators that heteros have to be wary of!I'm not sure where I found the 3 stars; maybe the nice location and photography, and perhaps the acting can be said to be ok, given the rubbish they had to deal with.",3,1,17,7 July 2018
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Shame it was the last one in the series
","(because the failed reboot doesn't even count)
I thought this was a very nice sequel to the opening film, which had explained how our heroes gained their strange powers and set the stage for an enduring franchise. So I'm sorry there won't be any more follow ups by this engaging cast, since Chris Evans has become overly identified with the very successful Captain America franchise now. What I don't understand is the hostility of some people towards the film, particularly criticism of the acting by an excellent cast from people weaned on the sort of pap served up on US TV and at Saturday matinees. I could understand it if comic book fans had found glaring differences to the Marvel originals, but as films I think they stand up very well and I'm sure they will be well regarded by posterity. Right now there seem to be far too many people with personal axes to grind, which helps to explain the dire state of the country's political situation.",7,3,3,20 February 2018
Coco," Don't know why this is so highly rated
","Don't get me wrong, it's fun and ticks a lot of boxes - indeed the whole endeavour seems to have been planned with that in mind.
I love cartoons, or animated features, as they are weightily called nowadays, and my earliest cinematic memories are of Peter Pan, Dumbo and Bambi - films that I treasure to this day. And people are doing fantastic things with the medium now, so The Incredibles, Monsters and WALL.E have joined the classics among my favourites.
I like that the film addresses an interesting theme and a culture, but I enjoyed Book Of Life more, although both are refreshing and bring so much colour and liveliness to the screen. 
However, there are a great many animations that I rate more highly, not to mention other films in other areas. So I think 6 is about right for this one. I was enchanted by Inside Out, but only gave it an 8 (the same as classics such as Snow White and Fantasia), since there are aspects of it that are aimed at a younger audience.",6,8,23,13 March 2018
Avatar," Hope the sequel lives up to the first part
","This was a film of two very distinct parts that reminded me of Waterworld. Part one presents a fascinating new world and one learns about its internal logic. Part two is a standard violent US action movie.
The opening part of Avatar is a beautiful film of an alien world that exists on a spiritual level that is beyond the comprehension of the humans sent to exploit the planet's mineral wealth. Consequently, the human efforts to subjugate the population can be seen as the vile and ruthless commercial exploitation that it really is. The willfull destruction of the natives' tree home is one of the most shocking movie moments I have ever seen. Soldier Blue's massacre of Amerindian women and children was considered shocking at the time - and still is, given that it really happened - but one would have hoped that humans reaching out to the stars would've evolved beyond such base drivers as conquest and resource exploitation.
I suppose violence is inevitable in responding to creatures with such base motives and it is to the credit of a handful of humans that they take the other side (traitors to the human cause... really?), but the unequal struggle between primitive and space-age technology was a tragic waste of so many lives.
I won't give away they key about how the tide turned, but in demonstrating their superior ethics and allowing the defeated humans to safely leave the planet, the natives paved the way for the sequel. Sadly, that sequel is most likely to be based on the return of humans with overwhelming force, hellbent on extracting bloodthirsty revenge. I really do hope that Cameron manages to come up with something more spiritually uplifting in Avatar 2.",9,0,0,30 January 2018
The Artist," A beautiful film!
","Would you like to see A Star Is Born with a happy ending? Then don't miss this film!
It was a huge risk to produce a B&W silent movie in this day and age, but they've done a magnificent job. It carries you along with charm and wit, and even plays a little with the silent concept, for added spice. The French leads are delightful and involve one right from the start. The acting is superb, right down to the supporting cast, as indeed it has to be to transmit the message without sound. A special mention for James Cromwell, who can be a really nasty character in some of his roles, but here turns in a wonderfully nuanced performance as the loyal chauffeur.",8,2,5,7 March 2018
La La Land," Not the best 2016 film, but much better than the one that won the Oscar!
","Despite the very obvious contrivances, I enjoyed this film. Let's face it, films where two people singing loudly in one another's ear is not realistic. But often we find we'd like the world to be more like that - look at the opening routine, in response to traffic congestion, for example.
I sympathise with the desire to popularise jazz, which at its best is wonderful music, but all too often sounds like a combo all playing different tunes, or the same indulgence as much late 60s progressive rock, where the performers take a long detour so each instrumentalist can show off what they can do with the instrument. For me music is, essentially, melody and anything else tends to be just showing off (which is why so many young singers over-sing songs today). I also find the ethnic ownership battles foolish, veering on repugnant. The Beatles and Michael Jackson didn't produce music for 'white' or 'black' people! They just produced great music that could be enjoyed by anyone who appreciated the style. So the backlash against a 'white' guy trying to save jazz, and rejection of the film in favour of a much inferior one that had the right skin tone (it might be considered in some spheres to have introduced homosexuality to 'the black audience' but I think that's ludicrous; the guy wasn't gay, he was just grabbing onto affection in the one place he found it - in every other respect he followed the 'black' cliches of drug trafficker with gold teeth and flashy car) really turned me off the whole 'Oscars' crap.
With so many reviews, I'm sure the major aspects have been more than adequately covered by others, so I will limit myself to something that most people who I've talked to about this film have overlooked, in relation to the ending. Of course we all (well most people, surely) wanted them to get together in the end. But what I really liked about the ending and those ironic smiles is that - because they truly loved one another - they were really pleased that each had followed their dream and achieved it. And that's what love is all about - putting somebody else's well-being and success ahead of our own desires. Sadly, those desires are far too often expressed in a desire for ownership and control of the other person, who needs to be constrained within our shadow. That's not love, that's slavery! So it was wonderful to see this film rise up above that and send out the positive message of following our dreams and translating our love into helping and encouraging others to follow their dreams too!",7,2,3,17 February 2018
Snowden," One of the most important films of modern times
","Irrespective of what one may think of the acting and directing (which I found just fine), the actual story sits alongside 'Inside Job' and 'Sicko' as revelations as to how the American way has been subverted in the name of unprincipled profit and corporate world domination. It is hardly surprising that Russia, China and even allies are pulling back from global partnership as they have realised how the USA's leaders cannot be trusted as partners, since their goal is US supremacy and control, vital agreements are discarded from one presidency to the next and cooperation is only interesting as long as it yields advantages (we still remember how the leader of a major nation who acted like that led us all into a global war).
It is tragic, because the ordinary American people are not like that and have always been noted for their willingness to help those in need, at home and abroad. Whistleblowers like Snowden are essential to a healthy society and it is disgraceful that in the USA they fear for their freedom, their jobs, economic well-being and even their lives. 
Watch this film to see how a proud American had his faith that his country's practices matched its espoused values eroded by what he saw in his privileged position within the intelligence community. And be proud of him that once it went too far he did something about it, even knowing that it would be at considerable personal cost.",8,1,1,9 May 2018
Groundhog Day," Keep trying till you get it right
","Some philosophies say that is precisely the purpose of life, but repeated over ensuing incarnations. By a quirk of Hollywood, Bill Murray gets to do it all in one go.
It is funny that an actress I don't rate very highly plays a major role in 2 of my favourite films (the other being 3W&1F; I also liked green card, but the star of that for me was the delightful conservatory). But imho the greatness of the film hinges on the path Murray's character takes when granted apparent immortality, with desperation followed by exploitation followed by despair and suicide attempts, until he finally gets it!
In the process, I don't know how many times he gets his face slapped by the object of his desires... affection... and eventually genuine love, but enough to give him a permanent disability if not for the daily reset button. Wouldn't we all like one of those! But in the meantime, there are a lot of very valuable life lessons in this film, as well as hilarious entertainment.",9,0,0,30 January 2018
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," spoof masquerading as heavyweight sci-fi
","It's FX-laden cannon fodder to be lapped up by US teenagers, but just comes across as pretty darn stupid to adults. I wasn't much taken with the first one, but the Ent figure and Zoe Saldanha provided enough to base a sequel on. Unfortunately, that was a pity, as in the sequel there are no redeeming features (except perhaps 'baby tree'). I won't waste any more time reviewing it, but just wanted to warn film buffs (including Marvel fans) who expect some sort of minimal standards from even their action entertainment.",5,2,5,29 August 2017
The Disaster Artist," weirdness glorified
","This film has only a fraction of the charm of Tim Burton's endearing testimonial to Ed Wood and epitaph to Bela Lugosi. Instead we get mainly plain weird. There were funny moments, but not the sort of rolling in the aisle funny.
 
This is certainly a rare case of 'it would be helpful to read a review beforehand' so that you realise it's actually a film about the making of a weird film (that has somehow become a cult work), plus a bit of backstory, and don't take it entirely at face value (which I did for most of the film and would've rated it lower in consequence). So it's worth a watch but is unlikely to be remembered, except perhaps in a bad joke sort of way.i think the essential difference between this and Ed Wood - and it makes all the difference imho - is that the latter was always working against adversity and lack of funding, which actually inspired a lot of innovation (even if much of it came across as tacky and amateurish). In contast, Wiseau has a secret bottomless fund that means he can bankroll his own film and keep changing personnel on a whim. The only suspense if whether everybody else will be able to put up with him long enough to get the film finished, and I dare say the regular cheques helped a lot in that process.",5,0,1,2 August 2018
American Made," Black comedy
","This film stands as an enjoyable adventure romp in the best TC style, but at heart it is a black comedy, although that may come as a surprise to non-Americans constantly bombarded by the notion that the USA is the bastion of virtuous western civilized values, particularly as, unlike 'Wag The Dog', this is not fiction, but 'alternative facts'. There are sources that will tell you how this film deviates from the true facts, but it is sufficiently close to what actually happened to send out a valuable warning.
And the warning is basically what is likely to happen when an individual with a defective moral compass goes through life saying 'Yeah, sure. That sounds like fun'. The extreme version is provided by Barry's brother-in-law, who has no moral compass whatsoever, but is driven exclusively by the gratification of his own immediate desires, to a degree that even the flawed Barry finds shocking. It is a timely lesson, given the way the Trump presidency and related worldwide turbulence is challenging everybody's values and calling us to reassess the world we want to live in from here on.
It's also a warning about how an 'America First' policy will continue to feed injustice and divide the world along competitive lines, just when we are most needing to work together to solve the problems the planet and human society are facing.
so you can enjoy this film at the most superficial level, or on a much deeper one, but either way it is good entertainment.",6,0,1,11 February 2018
The Holiday," Not a great movie, BUT
","It delivers exactly what it promises, a film for the victims of unrequited love - and who, honestly, has never been there? the message is, get out of your rut and who knows, maybe, just maybe, you will find what you are looking for. Because many people move in circles that are just made for that sort of frustration, but there are many others where you can relate to people on a normal basis (remember Notting Hill?).
The process is set up quite quickly and evolves as one might expect, but what's wrong with that, especially in the sort of seasonal fare that is meant to make us feel cozy and snug?
It is perhaps a sad reflection of our times that the film has been criticised not only for what it is but also what it's not, revealing much determination to be cruel and vile.
Yes, it's predictable, which is the default position for this genre - and tell me how many films are not; Parasite wasn't as good as the moving Shoplifters, but won the Oscar for being full of surprises.
No, it's not 'clever', but it's quite intelligent enough. Leave 'clever' to the thriller genre where it's most appropriate.
This film gives one a warm, sympathetic feeling, and plenty of laughs along the way, many provided by Eli Wallach, in a superb performance that at 90 years of age had the director keep telling him to slow down. That along is worth the price of a ticket or DVD (yes, I'm old-fashioned that way :)",6,0,0,24 May 2020
Munich," Answering two criticisms
","My colleagues here have given us some excellent descriptions and reviews, so i will just focus on these two aspects:
Firstly, there is the creation of the imaginary (?) French organization with international tentacles, which seems like a device that avoids revealing Mossad's real methods of going about occumulating information, including through the infiltration of 'enemy' organizations by operative who may well still have been in place at the time the film was made. It also serves as a useful device to deliver a few messages about ethics and political workings.
Secondly, there is the omission of the Lillyhammer and Salameh assassinations, both of which involved errors on the part of Mossad. But I don't think it was to protect Mossad that Spielberg didn't address them directly. I believe it was because they would detract from the basic point he was making in the film about the way vengeance exacts an emotional and moral price on the perpetrator, regardless of how justified their acts may seem to be. After all, even official state executors are changed fairly regularly, so how much more difficult must it be for agents hunting down their quarry amidst the goings on of ordinary human life? Indeed we would find it monstrous if they didn't suffer from conflicting emotions, since the alternative would be regarded as cold blooded fanaticism.
Spielberg has delivered an excellent work in the thriller genre, but there is a lot more going on here, for those who want to scratch below the surface and study the interweaving of complex psychological and political threads.",7,0,0,12 May 2020
Fantastic Four," Deserved better reviews
","I was sad that the critical reviews made this series such a difficult one to carry through. The cast is immensely likeable and the sequel was even better than the opener, which basically explained how it all started. Of course it didn't help that Chris Evans got dragged away to become a very successful Captain America. Like some other commentators, I suspect these two films will stand the test of time much better than many other superhero movies.",7,6,8,19 February 2018
Incredibles 2," Almost a 9!
","Whatever, this is a very welcome and long overdue sequel to the wonderful first film that is still 2nd among my favourite animations.
As a very good sequel, it loses in freshness but gains in familiarity. Jack-Jack adds much to the hilarity - his encounter with a raccoon is a high spot of the film. The only downside is Dash's hyper behaviour with gadget remote controls, which is both irresponsible and downright disrespectful (when he keeps snatching one out of his father's hand - one longs for some parental discipline there, so the irritation outweighs the humour).
I've seen criticism of the villain as being weak, but I think that's missing the point of the subtlety here. She's not an evil person, but a potentially very decent person whose attitudes have been distorted by resentment over the loss of her parents, which she attributes to the superheroes having abandoned them (whereas their activities had actually just been made illegal, thus taking them out of commission).
Another subtle element addressed in the film is to what extent a dependence on being rescued by superheroes has made ordinary people passive and less able to take care of themselves. It's clearly a Republican message about overdependence on government, but no less valid a question for all that.
Now I'm looking forward to The Incredibles 3 and hope I won't have to wait another 13 years!",8,1,2,8 November 2018
Hacksaw Ridge," A masterpiece of filmmaking!
",Mel Gibson has managed to portray the integrity of an individual standing by his beliefs and insisting on serving his country in the best way he knows - despite that country's sometimes perverse efforts to thwart his intentions and challenge his faith - while simultaneously portraying with frightening realism the savagery of modern warfare that showed up so starkly everything the hero was against. It is nice to see true goodness - as opposed to the fake Hollywood variety - portrayed in film with all the complexity and courage that embodies.,8,2,2,26 April 2018
Me Before You," Wow, how different from Game of Thrones!
","Emilia Clarke is cute and totally lovable in this film, portraying a quirky character who is all heart. And I can understand why girls might swoon over Sam Claflin, even when (SPOILER ALERTS) wheelchair bound.Despite the tragic background, this is a delightful film that, while raising very serious issues, focuses on the personalities and how they interact. The result is often very funny, but also very moving.Consequently, I am saddened by the reaction of some people, but it also helps me to understand the Trumpist backlash against the 'thought police' in American society. Because unfortunately there are some people who are not content to allow others to watch a film and form their own opinions about the issues portrayed. They want to tell them how to feel and how to think and it is heretical if the film allows the viewers to come to conclusions that may differ from their own. If the film does not specifically embrace their own views and values then they will try to harm it at the box office by driving people away through their rabid criticism.Fortunately, this film is way above that putrid level and can be enjoyed both as entertainment (comedy, drama & romance) and for the meaningful questions about life that it raises. I found it comparable to 'Whose Life Is It Anyway' and even better than 'The Intouchables'.",8,2,2,9 October 2017
