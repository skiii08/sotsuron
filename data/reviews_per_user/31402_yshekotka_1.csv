Catch Me If You Can," Another Hollywood Masterpiece
","There is a popular belief that if a movie is directed by Steven Spielberg and if it stars Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Hanks and Christopher Walken, this movie is bound to be successful. However, these factors weren't the only key factors that had made me watch this movie, but also the fact that the main idea is based on real-life events. I just can't resist such movies. So, proceeding to the story itself, it's about a young man being underaged who has the brass to not only to take on the role of a doctor, pilot, lawyer, etc. but to pull a con game on FBI. If it was possible to say that pulling a con game on FBI and on the country, in general, can be described as being professional, I would definitely say that the main character Frank Abagnale Jr. (Leonardo DiCaprio) did it professionally. Throughout the duration of the plot, he is chased by an experienced and rule-bounded F.B.I. agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks), who several times let the DiCaprio's character slip through the fingers. Nonetheless, agent Hanratty manages to do it and the final Frank's escape fails. Fails, but not for long.
To be honest, I tried to watch this movie twice, but it was kind of impossible for me. The problem was that I really was not able to catch the plot of it. When watching it for the 3rd time I finally managed to understand the whole idea, the whole story, that seemed to me as something uncatchable. So does Frank Abagnale Jr., so tells us the headline of the movie.
I have already noticed that the director is Steven Spielberg. I believe that when you hearing that a movie is going to be made by this great person, you know in advance that it's going to be a masterpiece beginning from the idea and finishing with the way of the picture in general. A great deal of film scenes is considered to be a masterpiece. Also, I like that the story, at first sight, is a criminal, but at the same time, it is sprinkled with romance and humour. I cannot help but notice an amazing. Actually, the director collected all the actors, who you cannot expect less from. Each one fit into an image of their characters.
Finally, if you are a fan of true-story movies and tangled storylines with an unexpected run-out, this movie has been created for you. Enjoy watching!",10,0,1,19 February 2019
