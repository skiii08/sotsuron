Child 44," Another overlooked movie the film buff must see.
","I really enjoyed this movie. A little bit of everything for those who like this genre of fiction. It is another movie that deserves so many awards and yet will be overlooked by so many American film viewers. Noomi Rapace is really good. She seems to nail every role she takes. Agnieszka Grochowska is nice to see, again, and will hopefully do more fine films. I also enjoyed Fares Fares' performance and would like to see him do much more films. For those who enjoyed this movie I highly recommend watching a made for television movie called Citizen X which was based on a true story and Child 44 seems to mirror in some ways. Stephen Rea was superb in Citizen X. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0112681/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1",8,2,7,24 July 2015
