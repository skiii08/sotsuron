Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Maul and Qui Gon dying in the same scene
",I think that the only bad thing about the Phantom Menace is that Darth Maul and Qui Gon died in the same scene. I just think that Locus should've saved Maul for Episode 2 and had Dooku fight Qui Gon and Kenobi. I know that Dooku was a jedi in The Phantom Menace and fell to Dark Side between The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones.,9,2,4,8 August 2017
Die Hard," Great job with the dialogue.
","I think that Die Hard was a great action movie for the 80's and the 90's because most of the action movies made in the 80's, the main character was the villain of the movie. For example, Arnold Schwarzenegger was the villain in the Terminator series. I mean I know he was kind of a hero in some parts of the movies, but overall, he was the villain. So I think that Die Hard was a really great action movie because it was great on how it was 1 cop against 13 terrorists. And I think that Bruce Willis was the perfect choice to play John McClaine.",10,0,1,8 August 2017
