I am Iron Man!There is no way that I could describe my emotions for this movie. I'm totally speechless.I'm fully on my emotion, there are so many tears of joy and loss. Amazing story, the acting is outstanding, epic action, great CGI, the best storytelling ever told in a superhero movie, amazing performance. I love it more than 3000.It's not just a superhero movie, it's more than that.#ReadyOrNot #WhateverItTakes.Go watch it for yourself.",10,0,3,26 April 2019
