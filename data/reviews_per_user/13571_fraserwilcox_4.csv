Raiders of the Lost Ark," One of the greatest action movies ever made
","Some of the most memorable and most referenced scenes and sequences were immortalised by this triumph in film-making. Indiana Jones is a superbly crafted and superbly portrayed character in this classic action flick that deserves its reputation and love among fans of film.Right, now I've said that, I'd like to get to the real reason I'm writing this review. I am getting thoroughly frustrated and annoyed by all the tedious people pointing out the 'gaping plot-hole' that supposedly resides in this movie's story. This apparent 'flaw' goes something along the lines of (cue whiny and irritating nerd voice): 'Indiana Jones is irrelevant to the story. If he wasn't in it the movie would pan out in exactly the same way.' And occasionally people would add: 'He adds nothing to the movie'; 'You can't consider him a hero'.Shut the f*ck up, all of you!While it can definitely be argued that if Harrison Ford's whip-wielding, gun-toting, lovable adventurer were taken out of the story, the movie would still end with (spoiler alert, everyone) the Nazis opening the Ark of the Covenant and all being killed, but how people conclude that that makes Indiana Jones an inessential asset to the movie is frankly idiotic.If it weren't for Indy's presence throughout each scene, what would this movie be? It would essentially be just a documentary about a Nazi excavation team searching for an ancient religious artifact and then all dying (except it wouldn't actually be a documentary because it never f*cking happened). There would be no conflict or tension because all the characters would be the Nazis and wouldn't do anything interesting (at least, not until September 1939). Thematically, Indy is in nearly every scene of the film because, funnily enough, he is the main character and we are seeing the story play out through his eyes and from his experiences. He's the one to root for in the story. He's the character the audience likes and wants to see come out the other end of the story victorious. Who would you root for without him? None of the other protagonists would even be there if it weren't for Jones and don't say you'd be rooting for the Nazis because of obvious f*cking reasons.Aside from him being the inadvertent story-teller, he's also the cause of nearly every great f*cking scene. What would the movie be without the giant boulder chase, the fist fight by the aeroplane or the frankly brilliant scene where Indy shoots his way out of getting into a sword fight. People must realise that without Indy this movie would be about ten minutes long, not to mention without its iconic charm and straight up fun.So Indiana's absence from the film does take something from this masterpiece; about 95% of it to be honest. I honestly believe that (and I can feel hate coming my way for making this accusation) the only people who give a f*ck over this moronic and non-existent plot-hole are the people who get agitated when film-makers diverge from the norm of film-making, as if that's too much for them to comprehend. 'No I'll stick to what I know, what I'm comfortable with already'. Just because a film doesn't involve a main character with the same kind of impact to a film that's been used in media countless times before does not mean it should be criticised.Above all stop calling this minute detail a 'plot-hole'. It's not one. A plot-hole is something that causes the plot to be inconsistent or contradictory or just simply events that wouldn't ever happen. And to all those people who don't consider it a plot-hole, stop pointing it out anyway and just enjoy the f*cking film, because it's actually really good.",Null,2,4,6 April 2016
Suicide Squad," Suicide Squad: an appropriate name for something so suicide-inducing...
","Here we go again. You thought Batman vs Superman was pretty bad (and if you don't then please reconsider) but this is... this is... something else. I hope this isn't the start of a trend with the new DC universe; making movies that polarise audiences into those who love and those who hate, especially seeing as I always seem to be falling on the 'hate' side of every argument.This movie is really quite sad. Such a waste of such great potential (BvS much?). There's a good movie in here somewhere, but it's a prime example of studio interference getting in the way of vision and direction. For those who aren't aware already, just months prior to its release Suicide Squad underwent inordinate amounts of reordering and re-shooting. Why? Because the studio saw the success of films like Deadpool and disappointments like BvS earlier in the year and decided that Suicide Squad needed to be 'funnier' and 'quirkier'. Was it made funnier? Well it's not funny anyway, so no. Is it quirkier? Well I'll probably never know how quirky it was originally, so how the f*ck would I know?! Writer and director David Ayer must feel pretty cheated. I really don't think this is the result he had envisioned. Please don't pin the blame on him. At least not all of it. I mean, he still let this monstrosity happen.I'll say one thing in defense of the people at Warner Brothers responsible for Suicide Squad: fantastic work at marketing this schlock. The trailers actually looked rather promising and people really were excited to see the strange and relatively unknown characters come alive on the big screen. Apart from Harley Quinn (who I only knew by name and nothing else at the time) I'd never heard of any of the Squad's members prior to the movie's announcement, but teasers and trailers piqued my interest effectively enough to want to learn more. However it was curiosity that killed the cat. In this case, the cat saw Suicide Squad, hated it, took its title a little too literally and shot itself. Lucky cat.It's difficult to get across just what it is about some of the scenes in this film that is just so insulting and displeasing to watch. But I think fellow IMDb reviewers and I can generally agree that a lot of this movie is BORING. I don't mean boring in the sense that nothing is going on, because things are definitely happening, but the 'things' that are happening are so unstimulating and stilted it's impossible to find anything engaging. Well shot action gives off an impression the viewer is physically involved and every punch, every bone-break, every landed bullet has an impact (literally and figuratively). Most of the action pieces feel like you're viewing them through a telescope; there's no real sense of presence half the time and it makes the action feel like there's no payoff at the end. I'm not saying I could do better, but the people making these shots SHOULD do better. They're the one's getting paid extortionate amounts to do this job. You wouldn't give a glazier a million dollars to smash all your windows.On the subject of action sequences, the finale to this sh*tty movie is honest to Christ one of the most laughable, most poorly executed scenes I've ever seen. That's not a hyperbole, I seriously mean that. I really don't think I've ever seen slow motion used so shoddily in a movie; it made me audibly cry out in pain over how agonisingly out of place it was. Also it made me realise that the ending was not coming as fast as it ought to. SPOILER ALERT: they win, surprise surprise. SPOILER ALERT: no one cares.But badly shot action is not the only chunk of semi-digested sweetcorn in this clogged cesspit. Pacing was all off. Oh this movie definitely has pacing. It's nothing f*cking but. It's a chore to keep up with the cacophonous cascade of plot points, exposition, and character introductions (many of which were pretty damn pointless, especially Slipknot's; he dies immediately). I'd quite like to watch this film again, but only to time how many scenes actually last longer than three minutes. Seriously, if you have ADD, I strongly recommend you go see Suicide Squad.There are many other points I could make to condemn this movie's production, but there are myriad arguments and I'm tired.Let's face it, nearly all of those who liked this farcical crap have got what I like to call 'BvS-syndrome', where they wished so hard to enjoy Suicide Squad that they began to believe their own delusion and actually managed to do it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to discourage anybody from enjoying this film. That's what its intended purpose was and if you're able to do that, good on you. But, for f*ck's sake, do not go out of your way to try and convince the quote- unquote 'haters' that they're wrong to dislike it, or that they didn't get it, or that they're just being cynical for the sake of it. Why would I, a supposed 'hater', deliberately go out of my own way to dislike something just to... what... make a statement?! No one gives a f*ck what I think (he says whilst writing a forty-nine line long review on IMDb). I wanted to like Suicide Squad. I really did. But wanting to like something should not be my soul reason for liking it. A good reason to admire something is... you know... that something actually earning my admiration. Yeah?Also, f*ck Zack Snyder...",Null,4,8,13 September 2016
Divergent," Forgettable, Clich√©d and Bland
","Oh God, where to begin?This is yet another one of those dull teen films that literally exists only because money-grabbing film-makers realised the books were kind of popular with the teenagers at the time, and, as a result, only teenage book-fans would ever claim that they actually enjoyed this tedious waste of everyone's time.You can tell that the premise for this 'story' came before anything else did; credit where it's due, the idea that society in the future is split into multiple different factions designed for a specific purpose to help the whole community is quite a convincing and interesting idea for a movie's setting (if only it's not one that's been used fifty f*cking times already).So our main character is Tris, played (though I hate to say it) rather badly by Shaylene Woodley and she's a 'Divergent'. Her (awkward and forced) love interest is Four, played (also rather badly) by Theo James and he's also a Divergent... I think. I wasn't really paying attention. And our main villain is Jeanine, played by Kate Winslet and she might be a Divergent, who knows. Who cares. I certainly don't.To put it as concisely and bluntly as possible, this film is BLAND. You'll come away from it having not given a single f*ck about any one of the characters because they're so boring and two-dimensional. I can't tell if that's down to poor acting or a poor script, but it's almost definitely both.I can't stress how little I felt for the (and I use this word loosely) characters, because they lacked so little actual 'character'. Even when (spoiler alert, everyone) Tris' mother died, just nothing. No emotion was felt. And that's not just because I'm a heartless bastard, it's because she, like practically everyone else in this blank canvas of a movie, had no major impact on or off camera and also her total screen time was about five minutes. But I guess it's really emotional because mothers dying is really, really sad(!) Then her dad died and I somehow managed to give even fewer f*cks than when her mum died; and I gave no f*cks for that. Even Tris didn't seem to care that much. Come on, Tris, how can I feel bad for you if you quite blatantly don't give a sh*t.Seriously, the only person in this entire movie I felt anything for was Miles Teller's portrayal of Peter, but only because Peter was a complete d*ck who unnecessarily insulted everyone else and that made it fun to hate him. At least being a massive d*ck is some sort of character trait, something everyone else in this film just doesn't have. When your favourite character is the one you hated the most, what does that say for the film he/she's in?I can't go into details about the main protagonists and antagonists and their respective personalities because, like I've probably said too many times already, they don't really have any. I wasn't even entirely sure what the main villain's motivation was because it was never properly explained. Oh well, I guess just being evil is motivation enough for these writers(!)It's easy to see that the only reason this franchise is getting the success and attention it's receiving is the fact it's piggybacking on the success and attention of the Hunger Games franchise. I mean, for f*ck's sake, the similarities between the plot and premise of the two is ridiculous. The main difference is this movie is filled with a lot more contrivances, tropes and story clich√©s. Oh yeah, and it's so much more f*cking BORING.So if you're thinking of watching this movie, I recommend you don't...",4,1,2,6 April 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," A bad movie that people only say is good because they desperately want it to be.
","Well done Zack Snyder and all those involved for creating what is certainly one of the most polarising films... ever. This really is one huge Marmite sandwich you've given us, with people either liking this movie to such a huge extent that they'll personally attack anyone who criticises it, contrasted with those who hated it to such a great measure that they'll personally attack anyone who gives it praise. There seems to be no middle ground, no grey with people's opinions of this movie; it's just black and white. Fitting, seeing as this movie was so dreary and sullen at times that it could have almost benefited from a neo-noir aesthetic. And where do I stand in this divisive spectrum? Well, look at the rating out of ten I gave this piece and you should work it out from there.Let's start from the beginning. The title to this movie is just plain wrong. It's misleading and manipulative, making cinema-goers believe they're in for an epic showdown between two of some of the greatest, most recognisable, most iconic figures in comic book history. And yes, it does happen... after an hour and a half of waiting around... and it only lasts five minutes... and it's boring. It only lasts five minutes AND it's f*cking boring! For a movie that is two and a half hours long to have the main theme, the main purpose, to constitute to about 3% of its total run-time makes it disappointing and leaves the audience feeling cheated. It would be like calling the entire Harry Potter franchise 'The Death of Dobby'. More of this movie's run time is devoted to the 'exposition via timely news reports' trope than actual superhero combat, for f*ck's sake. F*ck the writers for those lazy bits of screen writing and all.No word of a lie, so much of this film rendered me physically angered.Don't get me started on the f*cking 'Martha' topic. People from both sides of the argument for this 'plot-point' seem to get it wrong, but the reason for it is to cause Batman to see a shred of humanity in Superman through learning that he has a human family, thus deterring Batman from killing him. Also, since Martha was also Bruce Wayne's mother's name, he decides to aid Superman in preventing his mother's demise as he knows the crushing emotional feeling of parental loss. Once put like that, it's quite a neat little bit of narrative... But that doesn't stop the film's execution of the scene from being so bloody, f*cking stupid! Bruce Wayne despised Superman. The fact his mother was in peril wouldn't stay his hand, because of the pain and destruction Superman had caused, not just to thousands of members of the public, but to Bruce personally as well. If your mother's name was Klara, would that stop you from murdering Adolf Hitler? And it's not like Martha was Clark Kent's biological mother; Superman's parents were Kryptonians, just like him. Seconds before killing Superman, Batman even references the notion that Superman has parents, so it's not like the discovery of a mother is any surprise to him. Defend this segment of the film all you want, but it's poorly done and just plain, f*cking idiotic.One of the most frustrating things I associate with this movie are quotes from some of the cast and crew, who, during interviews, had stated that Dawn of Justice may put off certain theatre-goers as the film may prove 'too smart' for them. You pretentious, condescending, little c*nts. I suppose the writers' definition of 'intelligent narrative' is the same as my definition for 'too many themes and plot points cobbled into one scene, resulting in dialogue and pacing sounding out of place, vapid and causing confusion as to why it takes place at all'. But it's not as if the themes are difficult to comprehend: Bruce Wayne dislikes Superman because he causes destruction despite heroic actions (a common notion held by multiple characters that is blatantly explained throughout most of the film); Superman often feels the same way, and... that's pretty much his personality in its entirety for the film, 'nuff said. It doesn't take a genius to suss this one out, Jesus Christ! This movie takes itself way too seriously, as do its rabid fans.I probably would have given this movie a higher rating (maybe five stars, or four and a half if IMDb would let me) had it not been for the fact that this is one of the most anticipated movies ever and had so much potential for greatness, but ended up as a drawn out, messily put together, confusing bore, that appears to think itself as being far smarter than it really is and that seemed more preoccupied in setting up future DC movies to come than in actually succeeding as an entertaining stand-alone.But there is some hope to glean from 'Dawn of Boring': the hope that maybe people will stop entrusting their movie products with Zack Snyder; that people will realise his style is bland and dated by today's standards (which is a shame, because his style is the only thing he really has going for him in terms of movie-making, as he's already proved that he can't write) and he'll be forced to reevaluate his credibility as a director. This isn't a personal dig at you with the intention of insulting you, Zack. I'm just saying you're in the wrong line of work.Do quit your day job...",Null,1,4,31 August 2016
