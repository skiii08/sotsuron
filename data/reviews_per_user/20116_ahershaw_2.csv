The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Satisfying Build-up to the Grand Finale
","The Hunger Games-Mockingjay Part 1 is an immensely moving first half of the conclusion to this successful franchise.Jennifer Lawrence delivers what she has been delivering throughout The Hunger Games franchise: a strong character whose reactions to certain situations are crystal-clear and performance is un-cringeworthy. She, as always, leads the cast. Another actor who stood out from the crowd for me had to be Josh Hutcherson, due to the dramatic change in atmosphere he added to the story. He and Lawrence work perfectly together, and the scene involving their scuffle was executed well.Despite the great tension that occurs every now and then, the pacing is a little sluggish, saved by Jennifer Lawrence's exceptional acting skills. Personally, I believe that this movie achieves what every first part of a franchise finale should achieve: intrigue the viewer into desiring to watch the second part, which is exactly what it has done for me.",7,0,10,29 December 2014
The Maze Runner," Enjoyably Mysterious Action Movie
","The Maze Runner is a captivating movie centred around Thomas, a young man who awakes in a village populated entirelyby males and has forgotten who he is. He becomes fascinated by the immoral maze surrounding the village, eventually leading to him entering it against the warnings of the inhabitants of the village.Dylan O'Brien brings the character of Thomas to life and makes him likable. The other actors played their roles well.However, when Teresa appeared, the plot seemed to tumble downhill. Teresa does not contribute a great deal to the story. Plus considering the young men had been trapped together for years with not a single female in sight, they didn't seem to be that shocked when she showed up and I was expecting some of them to be throwing themselves on top of her. Additionally, the plot was predictable at times-everyone knew that Thomas would rebel and stride into the maze soon enough, and everyone knew that Thomas would be the one who 'changes the villagers' lives forever.' None-the-less, the story is interesting and the action was fast-paced as well as tense.",7,6,9,29 December 2014
