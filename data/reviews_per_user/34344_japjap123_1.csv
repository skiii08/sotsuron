Mission: Impossible III," Best Mission Impossible !
","I have watched this movie last night and I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised ... I did't like the previous one MI:2 and I think the first was good but nothing special...MI3 does have all the elements of a good action movie : crazy stunts, amazing action scenes and explosions, great locations (Rome, Shanghai,...) very well acted and it never gets boring. Also I like Philip Seymour-Hoffman,he played a very convincing bad guy and I think Tom Cruise played very well and what I also liked in this movie is that the 'team' is more important and not only Ethan Hunt BUT the best thing about this movie were the superb action scenes especially on that bridge ( it reminds me of true lies but just better). In one word I really enjoyed this one and I'm going to see this movie another time.9/10",10,9,19,3 May 2006
