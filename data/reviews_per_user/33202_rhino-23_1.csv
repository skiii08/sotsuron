Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Right on target!!
","What can I say about this movie other than it was just what I thought it would be. I have been a SERIOUS Star Wars fan for 22 years and don't plan on stopping just because of a character like Jar Jar Binks. Enough said on that.The story-line was superb, it sucked me in just like all of the Star wars films and I can hardly wait for the next two installments.",9,0,0,28 May 1999
