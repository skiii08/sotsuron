The Blair Witch Project," Not for everyone.
","I thought Blair Witch Project was a good movie but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone because I have this feeling that everyone I'd recommend it to is going into this movie thinking it's Scream 3. After the movie was over, everyone around me was saying that 'it sucked', 'the ending was lame' and so on. Like other people have said people are going into this movie with the wrong expectations. Also, I'd like to say I had no problems with the hand-held footage because I've seen hand-held footage 20 times worse.",8,0,1,6 August 1999
The Waterboy," Lame, retarded, one of the funniest movies ever !
","Being from a part of Louisiana considered 'Cajun country' and living only a few minutes from bayous and swamps, some members of my family did not want to watch this movie based on the fact 'it made fun of cajuns'. I honestly don't know why, it in no way is a serious movie nor does it try to be. In fact, it has to be one the funniest movies I've ever seen. Rob Schneider plays what has to be the greatest character ever next to Dave Letterman's monkey salesman in 'CabinBoy.'  You Can Do It ! You Can Like This Movie (if you try to).",10,0,2,20 August 1999
