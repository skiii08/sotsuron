Men in Black 3," can the cinema today can get any worse?
","This is one of the baddest movies I have watched, but its nothing different from the other shallowness in todays cinema.. I mean the cinema this days doesn't even surprise me anymore, and yet it surprise me every time, probably because I still think, that there could be some 'light in the end of the tunnel', like Avatar has surprised me years before, because I thought things were finally moving forward.. Well, I guess I was wrong, because here we have the same 'crap' again, only its make more shallower and more superficial than ever. Can the cinema this days get any worse?? And I would be surprised if it can..First lets take with the characters, well take the Jemaine Clement, which plays the main 'evil'-guy and gives probably the most convincing role, but the character he plays is filled so much with 'evil-shallowness', and if it could just be at least something to laugh upon, but I don't find this the case through the movie.. Then its Will Smith, with no jokes upon him(which makes him shine in Prince of Bell Air for instance) and the character he plays is not convincing.. Tommy Lee Jones rude behaviour puts me waaay back. The only that I find at least somehow convincing is Josh Brolin, and I don't know why, but the parts he plays I find the best..And its not about the its the directing part in today movies that gives me the impression that there is somebody always laughing at me, making the 'best' crap of movies they can, and then smiling faces, myself realizing that people would bought that stuff. And I don't know what jokes is upon, but I just don't get it. Every time I see another movie I wonder what drives this people to the cinema(and I am sorry, but its true, and I really don't get it..) Every time I go, like today, I except something 'different', only to be left down again. And thats over and over and over again.. I mean of course this is pop-corn, but its such a bad pop-corn piece of crap... And I am sorry about that but I think I just couldn't find a better word for it. And its its the case of all the Hollywood movies they make this day..I would give it maybe 2/10, or maybe 3/10, if it was for beginning to the close end of the movie, that part I find the most interesting, but it was such a dull experience, I just couldn't get it more than 1 out of 10..",1,11,25,9 June 2012
Apocalypse Now," Good film, but REDUX v. SCREWED it all
","One thing about i liked about the original version is that it is totally version is totally >>political incorrect<< and meaningless. It doesn't gets represented in good guys and bad guys, but get a human as a whole structure, and it gets this really well. Like in example you didn't see Kilgore as a bad person. In fact you didn't see him at all. All you see is his dreams and thoughts, which actually led to his destruction.But what about political incorrectness with the new REDUX version: It licks the French butts, giving the Frech plantage scene on of the crappiest and meaningless IDIOTIC scene ever shot. I give the idiotic term, because it actually destroys the whole point of the movie, which is not about race and condition, but human as a whole!One thing about Redux. The original was >visual astonishing< masterpiece, but what redux adds is A WHOLE LOT OF VISUAL EFFECTS. If this would set to minimum, i would love it, but after watching it, i get a filling of too much candy taste!, and you get that the whole point of this scene...and that...and this is avout This. About candy.Giving this two reasons, i still have the ORIGINAL version in one of my favourite movies of all time and it would be hard to describe this film as a whole of my experience, because i still try to give it out of my head. What I actually liked about original is that it explores the 'dark side' of human, and it did with such a way, that you will remember this film MONTHS or maybe even years after you have been watching it. I watched it more than 20 times already. It's a true classic!Like someone already said, the redux version didn't add nothing to this film, while i would say that it makes this film horrible!! I would too preferred to have two different versions in IMDb, giving viewers a choice, which is actually good and which is a crap. I actually scored the original. With REDUX i would give it minimum.Sorry for my bad English and expression, i am not a native speaker. I still tried my best, to describe my feelings and emotions.",9,0,1,23 November 2006
Beauty and the Beast," Concerning much of the comments made here..
","About Emma Watson really horrible play, everybody said that its for directors and producers to put blame on. Nobody say she is just a bad actress or that she just needs to put some time on characters she is going to play. The problem I hear is it's directors and producers to blame, but that is just great manipulation since No one can add bring life to that lifeless horrible play of her I can tell.. Moreover both Luke Evans as 'Gaston' and Dan Stevens as 'the Beast' played their character well, or at least better then Emma Watson her Belle. That's to say outside of Hollywood it is Expected for characters to bring life to their to add their own originality and to try to understand their characters, but not by Harry Potter and Emma Watson fans, which in my eyes is just stupid and doublefaced..",3,3,9,19 March 2017
Lucy," I must say that was 'over the top'
","Human can only use 10% of the brains, but what if they use more? This sci-fi work asks this question.Throw in The fifth element(1995), add in a guy from a Transporter as a main lead, only this time he is playing a woman, with special superpowers actually a Mix between Neo, from Matrix and Nikita, add the late 90s latest street babble about some new drugs who can seriously affect the brains (in a strange way of course) and a Morgan Freeman as a Serious scientist who is working on some Serious scientific project about 'this stupid humans', who are only limited around the percent of brains they could use simultaneously and tad of some korean guys as a main bad guys and you will probably get what this movie is about.The whole story is really so silly and I also believe it was a Luc Besson take on action heroes movies. Watch it, especially if you are light-hearted and never takes cinema anywhere seriously.",7,6,16,23 August 2014
Godzilla," bored out from this special effects showoff..
","If I would rate this movie on special effects only it would be a perfect 10, but otherwise it's pretty boring. I remember watching Roland Emmerich Godzilla back when I was a kid, and like any other movie in that day, for instance Independence day I loved it, maybe you say, that I was a kid in that time, and I just can't appreciate things or see things as I see thing back then, but the problem is there is nothing even particularly interesting in this new version of Godzilla.I never understand what's with all the action heroes movie frenzy. In Spiderman(2002) you have two heroes in a swimming suit who are fighting, here you have two monsters that are fighting in the same way that in every other action heroes movies.. and 'oh my god' is it booooring.... Movies like, they are called 'thrillers', they were supposed to make you care for the characters and they were supposed to move you out of your seat and here I didn't move even an inch.. And I doubt if its ever possible for me, to get old like that..Like I say If I talk about special effects, characters animations and all that its perfect 10, or maybe 9 out of 10, but otherwise this has been boring as hell.. This movie is all about special effects, so much effort is put into, that whats considered atmosphere is just beauty and awe, it's just so shallow.. And I am not against beauty and awe, when its put to good use, but All aside, it's stable to say you would be more moved just running 3dMark with the new computer, then this movie..",3,3,8,18 May 2014
Sully," Beautifully crafted film
","==THIS REVIEW HERE MIGHT CONTAIN SOME HEAVY SPOILERS. VIEWER DISCRETION IS THEREFOR ADVICED==If you live in the west you probably already heared of this story. Technically speaking 'some' plane make their way through a flock of birds and with both engines hit and unworking, the pilot still managed to make their landing on the river Hudson and all the passenger had been saved. However, hidden to the public eyes there was also a back-story to it. Immidiatelly after the crash there was a federal investigation going on, where investigators run simulation programs to get their point proved. The point was that the pilot could get back to the airport, without putting their passenger on danger by landing on the river. However as we see through the end of the film, the investigators used this programs in the really dirty way, the one that gets their points prooven in the way that only technically speaking is possible, but humanly speaking totally impossible. For instance will the pilot in normal situations really turns around and drive the plane back to the 'base' the same seconds as the birds hit the engine?, as are things presented in the simulations as they ran Wouldn't he first try to run the engines and turned them on, only to realize in shock that the both engines have stopped working, and he is unable to turn them on, which is a really rare case I believe. Or wouldn't he make a call to the airport, checking that its free, for not hitting the other plane, that it's currently rising., and others..The translation of this film in my country is 'Miracle on the river Hudson', which I think is more to the point. As you watch this film you start to believe that is nothing more then a miracle. Or as Sully(Tom Hanks) puts it, when he left with his co-pilot the court, it goes something like that: 'I believe that we get it through very well. But we actually put it through better.' Clint Eastwoodis without a doubt a very respectable director and very respectable to all the characters involved. However this story also gets true to the truth as is humanly possible. There is no big bangs, no big unnecessary explosions, as long as they don't put anything to the Original story. For instance did you notice that when Sully(Tom Hanks) imagined a building hit by an airplane is the same that the women hit during running the second simulations run. You could imagine what Could happen if he listened to flight controllers and not, acted on his own, as he did.Technically speaking this is a beautiful crafted film. however I still have some negative points. Tom Hanks for instance could be in my eyes more livable. The film is also crafted with a dark and depressing tone to it, the darkness in this film is more moderated, but in my eyes could be made more livable. All in all, beautifully crafted film, which puts to the real story, answering some answers that might be risen.",8,1,2,9 September 2016
