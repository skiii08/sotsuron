Antz," Excellent Movie
","Antz, unlike Toy Story is a computer generated movie that is obviously not targeted at a younger audience.  The movie contains themes such as war, death, and adult humor (Woody Allen). The plot centers around one ant named Z who is one of the many 'workers' of the colony. Relaxing at a bar, he bumps into a beautiful ant that turns out to be the princess of the colony.  Unfortunately, he's not allowed to see anyone in the upper class unless he's a 'warrior'.  The rest of the movie follows him on his journey of impersonating a 'warrior' and rescuing the princess. The movie is very funny and the voices of Stallone, Stone, Allen, and Walken, work very well with the characters.  The computer images are amazing, showing things such as soda cans and drinking fountains as gargantuan structures.  Don't miss this movie, it's a movie presently like no other.  You'll get a lot of action, humor, and even romance.  We'll see how A Bug's Life compares to this.  I gave this movie an 8.",8,0,0,19 November 1998
Shakespeare in Love," Charming
","I don't know a lot about Shakespeare or his plays, but this was one pretty good movie.  There is a lot of chemistry between Viola and William, and enough comedy to keep this movie solid throughout.  Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow did an exceptional job playing their roles as did Geoffrey Rush.  Overall, a charming movie that is good for dates. 7/10",7,0,0,5 January 1999
Alien," One of the greatest horror movies of all time.
","Alien was an absolutely brilliantly filmed movie.  Ridley Scott really knew how to create an atmosphere suitable for this movie. The Nostromo was totally desolate, with long hallways and empty rooms.  The music and sound is very quiet, which is perfect for creating suspense and horror.  What really stands out from this movie however, is the Alien itself.  The biology of the Alien is absolutely intriguing; a lifeform perfectly suited for destroying other lifeforms.  A genre defining movie that is one of hollywood's best.  10/10",10,1,2,14 January 1999
Armageddon," BAMMO!!!!!!!
","Wow, what an EXPLOSIVE movie.  This movie was everything I expected it to be: action packed and plot deprived.  There wasn't a very interesting plot to the movie, as it just tells the story about a bunch of oil drillers trying to save the world.  That's the basic plot in a nutshell, and it is quite far fetched if not utterly stupid.  Armageddon makes up for it's lack of plot with it's explosive special effects and action sequences.  This movie provides large doses of suspense and adrenaline leaving the audience breathless or dizzy.  Some of the scenes happen so fast that it's hard to tell what's going on, and vomiting seems like an inevitability.  If action is your thing, and you really want to see things get blown to hell, this movie is your thing.  You will see New York get pummeled by a barrage of meteorites, and beautiful Paris disintegrate before your eyes.  However, if you're looking for a movie with a decent plot and some interesting characters, look elsewhere.  You'll just sit through the movie wishing you brought aspirin.  Because I'm a fan of movies like this, I gave this movie an 8 out of 10.",8,3,5,23 December 1998
Good Will Hunting," Loved It
","I came in to this movie not expecting much, but what I got was a powerful movie that taught me that talent should never be wasted.  Will Hunting is a man gifted with phenomenal intelligence.  He lives alone in Boston and spends his days hanging out with his friends, drinking beer, and beating up old bullies.  He supports himself with part time jobs like janitor work. When a college professor discovers that Will Hunting is a genius like no other, he decides to exploit him by offering him top rate jobs that would give him access to great prestige.  Will Hunting's therapist, played outstandingly by Robin Williams, want's Will to do what he wants and not be forced to go out into the world and change his entire lifestyle.  The movie follows Will Hunting as he matures from a scared defensive kid, to a man able to discover what path to take in his life. Great movie.   9/10",9,0,1,20 January 1999
Meet Joe Black," Death with a heart
","Despite its long running time (3 hours), Meet Joe Black manages to keep the audience enthralled with its captivating characters, and emotional story. Basically this movie is about 'Death' learning about life.  'Death' takes the form of a human in order to learn about life and what are its qualities if any. In doing so, he falls in love with the daughter of the man he's supposed to bring to death.  He must now decide whether to take the woman he loves into death, or leave her on earth to experience the goodness of life he's learned about.Meet Joe Black is a movie loaded with romance and drama.  The former part including scenes with Brad Pitt and Clair Forlani flirting with each other, or making love.  There is a lot of chemistry between the two, and it just brings a smile to your face when they interact with each other.  Anthony Hopkins brings a lot of drama to this movie, by outstandingly playing the part of a loving father with two daughters who must bear the weight of his company on his back.  This movie is well acted, and shouldn't be missed. You'll leave the theater, knowing how precious life is and that love can even conquer 'Death'.",9,0,0,17 November 1998
Grave of the Fireflies," Unbelievable
","Grave of the Fireflies is quite an experience.  I've seen the movie two times already, and the emotion it brings never changes or decreases.  As many times as I see it, I will never get numb to the melancholy mood of the story.  I've tried so very hard not to cry, but it's hopeless.  This movie is an unbelievable piece of work.  The animation is done extremely well, and the soundtrack increases the somberness of the movie. It is an all around outstanding movie, much better than any live action movie I've seen recently.  This is definitely one of Japan's gems, and should not be missed. Rent it at your local Blockbuster.  You won't regret it",10,3,4,11 November 1998
The Waterboy," Watered down comedy
","I'm a big fan of Adam Sandler movies.  When I first saw Billy Madison, I laughed so hard, I nearly choked on my popcorn.  His form of silly comedy was very refreshing to me and I enjoyed every movie he had since then.  His latest movie, The Waterboy, however, wasn't as funny as it's predecessors. Don't get me wrong, the movie has an abundance of laughs, but it seems as if many of them fell short of total hilariousness.  A lot of the comedy was physical, and not vocal.  That's okay, if you're a physical comedy fan, but Adam Sandler tackling everything viciously can be a bit repetitive. I recommend this movie to anybody who likes physical comedy. But don't expect a smorgasborg of uproarious comedy, what you'll get instead is comedy that is 'watered down' but still worth watching.  I gave this movie a 7 out of 10.",7,0,1,14 November 1998
