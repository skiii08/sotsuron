Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," See it again...
","I know that there are several people who have commented already that the new Star Wars is not up to the standards of the previous (or forthcoming, depending upon your perspective) episodes in the series, and I will be the first to admit that after seeing the movie the first time I felt the same way--I felt that it was mediocre at best.  The story was not very compelling, there were far too many digital effects, the actors were rather stiff, and Jar Jar Binks was the most annoying creature ever concocted for a motion picture.But then, I saw it AGAIN--and it was SO much more enjoyable the second time around!  I think it was because I decided the second time around to think of the Phantom Menace separately from the rest of the series and instead judge it according to its own merit.  I stopped looking for comparisons between the new characters and the more familiar ones from the original series as it was, of course, a DIFFERENT story. Even Jar Jar seemed more likable the second time around!  Even though I still felt there were too many computer effects, I thought the film was very enjoyable and more than enough to whet one's appetite for the second episode soon to come.Therefore, I encourage all those who did not enjoy Phantom Menace the first time to see it again--you may be surprised in spite of yourself!",10,0,0,3 June 1999
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Not THAT Bad!
","Though I agree that the original Jurassic Park was far better in terms of story coherence and suspense, I really don't believe that this movie deserves ALL of the flack that it is getting.  I'm pretty sure the whole purpose of this sequel was to throw in more action and excitement, and in those areas it really delivers.  It's supposed to be FUN. I remember when the original came out people bemoaned the fact that there were not enough dinosaurs or dinosaur action, and now that the sequel has provided just that people still seem unsatisfied.  Oh well.I also think I have to defend that infamous 'T-Rex loose in San Diego' sequence that everyone has ripped apart.  I don't think that Spielberg meant that scene to be taken too seriously--anyone who has studied his films knows that he always pays homage to other classic films, and this was his ode to King Kong/Godzilla.Regardless of popular opinion, I still believe that this film is a lot of fun to watch and is a fine continuation of the original rather than being a customary 'remake' sequel.  However, I honestly believe that a Jurassic Park 3 is not necessary--let it suffice that we all know that 'life will find a way.'",10,6,13,29 October 1998
