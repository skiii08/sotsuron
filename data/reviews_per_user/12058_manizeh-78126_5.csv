Ford v Ferrari," My first racing movie!
","I really enjoyed the movie. The racing scenes are awesome and exhilarating. The Ken Miles scenes are funny and enjoyable. I felt sad when he died in the end. The fistfight between Shelby and Miles made me laugh out loud in the theater. I heard some other laughs in the audience. I'm surprised that I understood it, since I don't know much about Le Mans (I'm an F1 mega fan). The scenes with Mollie and Peter are also nice. I especially enjoyed it because I watched it with my dad (another motorsport fan). The jokes are also enjoyable, even if they aren't meant to be jokes. Matt Damon and Christian Bale acted well. My favorite scenes were the ones where after Miles drove a car, he'd go into some mega explaining mode about how the car needs to be improved. He'd say things like 'Oh, the steering is too loose,' or 'The engine needs to be bigger,' or 'The car is way too damn heavy!' Those made me laugh a lot. I recommend this to anyone 13 and up. Really cool. Loved it.",10,1,3,22 November 2019
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Once again, this series never fails to disappoint.
","It seems that as the series progresses, each movie becomes more scary, emotionally hard to take, and more complicated. I like how Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) progresses from a simple girl trying to save her sister to a symbol in a rebellion that could start a civil war. I also liked Peeta's (Josh Hutcherson's) progression in the interviews with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci) as he slowly tries to warn Katniss to think about what she is doing in terms of being a symbol in a revolution. Each character progresses in a different way, even Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks).Firstly, I would like to say that the acting is excellent. Jennifer Lawrence makes Katniss's fear for Peeta's life shine. As she sees the interview with Caesar Flickerman and realizes that Peeta is alive, she runs towards the TV screen and touches it. That is a sign that Katniss truly cares about Peeta at that point, which means that Katniss's love for Peeta becomes more real than it was in the 74th Hunger Games. It was easy to tell when the real Peeta shone through. The real Peeta always had watery eyes.I also could tell that Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) was probably against Alma Coin, (Julianne Moore) who is the president of the supposedly-obliterated District 13. I was actually second-guessing myself on this fact, because at one point, he seems totally on Coin's side. At other times, he seems to disagree.I liked the scene where Plutarch tries to convince Effie to stop feeling as if she's a prisoner. That was funny. I totally cracked up when Effie changed her mind by saying, 'There isn't a soul in here who knows the first thing about Katniss' after Plutarch told her that he'll have to find someone else to be a part of Katniss's propaganda team.I also found it funny when Katniss listed her conditions to President Coin, ending with, 'My sister gets to keep her cat.'I was very excited when the rescue of Peeta, Johanna (Jena Malone), Annie (Stef Dawson), and Enobaria (Meta Golding) was initiated. I was anticipating Katniss's first meeting with Peeta since his capture, since I read the books first. The scene where Peeta chokes Katniss is MUCH more violent than in the book. In the book, Peeta just puts his hands around Katniss's throat. In the movie, he first shoves Katniss against a glass structure, and she breaks it. Then, Katniss falls to the ground and Peeta attempts to choke her. Because Katniss's face actually turned red, I wonder whether Josh Hutcherson actually had to choke Jennifer Lawrence while filming.The last scene is scary and emotional the same time. I felt my eyes growing bigger as Peeta tried, violently, to break the straps that held him down while screaming. I felt so bad for Katniss when she was staring in shock at what the Capitol had done to Peeta.Guide: Recommended for 14 and older, no cuss words, and emotionally hard to take. Peeta screaming as he tries to break free from his restraints might be disturbing to younger kids.",10,0,1,16 December 2018
The Hunger Games," AMAZINGLY AWESOME
","I'm honestly very impressed! At first, I was a bit scared, thinking it might be too violent and filled with profanity. This is the OPPOSITE of that. This and the other movies are excellent.Firstly, I love how well Jennifer Lawrence portrayed Katniss. She truly displayed Katniss's love for hunting and her skill at it. She also showed true fear when Prim (Willow Shields) was reaped for the Hunger Games.Next, after the interviews by Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), I loved how Katniss really put forth her anger towards Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) after he told the audience that he had a crush on Katniss for most of his life.I was absolutely in tears when I saw the scene where Rue died. Katniss was very upset, and that emotion was very realistic. I also love how she sacrificed so much to keep Peeta alive after she found him.Some of the more sweeter scenes were the ones with Katniss and Peeta. When Katniss first found a cave for them to settle in, the scenes following that were the most peaceful. There was a scene when Peeta wanted Katniss's comfort. That was sweet when they simply just cuddled for warmth so Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) would find more sponsors and send them food and medicine. It was also nice when Katniss lies to Peeta about not going to the feast so he could be calm.At the feast, I also liked how Thresh saved Katniss for her alliance with Rue.When Katniss and Peeta were scavenging for food, I liked how Katniss was genuinely scared when she heard the cannon, thinking it was Peeta. She ran over and gave him a meaningful hug. That was very sweet.Overall, the movie was AWESOME. They don't mention Katniss's prep team, Delly Cartwright, nor the mayor's family though. They don't mention Peeta's stylist, Portia, either.Guide: For ages 12 and over. Only profanity mentioned: 'damn' twice and 'hell' once. Lots of bodies, but hardly as much blood as I expected. Very straightforward, and very true to the book.",10,0,0,14 December 2018
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," I was on the verge of tears...
","I've read the books, and the movies aren't without its flaws, but this movie is a damn good conclusion to a wonderful movie series. The casting of Snape and McGonagall were absolutely brilliant, and the main trio matured quite well over the years.When I was watching Snape's memories, which revealed his true side, I was literally on the verge of tears. The part where Snape is crying and grieving over Lily's dead body is quite a tear-jerker.That's all I got to say. See you!",9,0,0,24 April 2020
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Loved it!
","As with the other movies, this installment is one of the best so far.For starters, I love how Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) actually become closer as friends. I absolutely love how Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks) shows her real personality when she says to Katniss and Peeta, 'You deserved...SO much better.' One of my favorite scenes from the movie is this:PEETA: You see, Katniss, the how whole friend thing works is that you have to tell each other the deep stuff.KATNISS: The deep stuff?PEETA: The deep stuff.KATNISS: Uh oh. Like what?PEETA: Like, um...what's your favorite color?KATNISS: Oh, NOW you stepped over the line.That's probably the funniest thing in the whole movie. Ever. Another funny scene is the one where Katniss meets Finnick (Sam Claflin).During the Victory Tour, the poor old man being shot and Katniss's rage at that event is VERY emotionally disturbing, but necessary to add in the movie. It shows how much trauma Katniss goes through.It sweet when in the train, Katniss wakes up screaming, and Peeta comes to check on her. As Peeta is about to leave, Katniss asks if he could stay with her. He agrees with no question, saying, 'Yeah.' That's nice.One thing I could say over and over again is the word 'eyes'. Eyes tell you everything, and the fact that I could see the fear in Katniss's eyes, the hatred, and the love, too is amazing. If these actors and actresses can accomplish such realistic emotions, they are excellent at their jobs.I like how serious Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) is when he tells Katniss and Peeta instructions to stay alive.In the arena, I like the scene where Finnick used CPR when Peeta ran into a force field. That was probably one of the most sweetest scenes in the movie. After Finnick rescues Peeta, Katniss starts sobbing, saying, 'You were dead!' She gives him a big hug. It's not disgustingly romantic, but it's the sweet kind.I feel sad when Katniss and Haymitch's friendship turns into hatred for Katniss when she realizes Peeta was captured by the Capitol, and Haymitch had broken his promise to keep Peeta alive and safe.I got a little scared when Johanna (Jena Malone) dug her knife into Katniss's arm to get the tracker out.Lastly, I like how after Gale (Liam Hemsworth) tells Katniss that District 12 had been destroyed, she looks into the camera with shock, which gradually turns into realization, and then into anger. That smooth transition between emotions is a nice touch to the movie.Overall, I love this movie. It's compelling, and the storyline is, yet again, amazingly true to the book.Guide: Not too much profanity. Just once use of 'sh*t' by Haymitch. Much more bloody and scary than the first movie. Recommended for 14 and older.",10,1,1,14 December 2018
