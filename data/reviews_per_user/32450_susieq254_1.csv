Deja Vu," Mind Candy
","Anyone who is interested in the possibility of time travel should definitely see this movie. It is spellbinding. Makes you wonder just how much of the government technology used in the movie is based on reality and how much is science fiction. I have seen it twice. I may even see it a third time. I rarely feel that strongly about a movie. I overheard a man walking out of the movie saying. 'I am really confused.' This is a thought provoking movie that woke me in the night thinking about it. Parallel universes, time lines, is it possible to undo horrible atrocities that have been committed - to change the past? Amazing mind candy! What the Bleep do we know anyway? Very little, as quantum physics is showing us. It may not a movie for people who are happy living on the surface of reality, people who aren't interested in questioning it. Oh, and it is a love movie also. The acting is superb. Denzel Washington and Paula Patton, and all the others, play their roles to perfection. The end is shocking yet fulfilling and brought tears to my eyes.",9,2,4,11 December 2006
