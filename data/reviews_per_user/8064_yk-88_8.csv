The King's Speech," King's hard work
","This story is about George VI who is to be king of England. However, he has very serious problem 'stuttering'. He and people around him work very hard in order to overcome this problem. What is going to wait for the climax? This film is based on the royal people. Actually I haven't seen such a movie to be pointed on 'Royal', so this time I really came to know how hard it is to be king. I learned a lot of things from this film. What I like in this film is that the cooperation of George VI and people around him. It is very moving, and I thought that people who create this film are amazing. I should have seen this at the movie theater! On the whole, for me, it is very touching!",8,0,0,1 October 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," interesting and moving
","The reason why I chose this film to watch is that this is very famous one in the world. Actually my mother recommends me to watch, so I picked this up. The story is about alien coming to the earth and living with people. At the beginning, a boy met the alien called ET, then they come to live together at his house with his brother, sister and mother. The boy named Eliot can understand ET's feelings. Through the days when they live together, they become good friends and have strong tie. In the end, what happens to ET? I completely like this film, because I enjoyed some different feelings like happy and sad. Also I laughed at ET, because he is cute enough to talk like human. Of course children can enjoy, but I think their parents also can enjoy this too. I really thought ET is very pretty. I think I should recommend people around me like my mother did if they haven't seen this.",9,1,2,1 October 2013
500 Days of Summer," Love?
","At the beginning of the story, a man named Tom and a woman named Summer meet in their workplace. Tom thinks she is very attractive, and he comes to like her. However, Summer is not like him. She thinks he is just a good friend, and not a boyfriend. As the title tells us, this film shows us the things happened until 500 days comes. They are to be very friendly, and their distance is getting closer and closer. What happens to the end? Is the relationship between them going to change into something different? I think this film is so interesting, and makes us think about love. It does not go well in every case. Through watching this film, I understood the difficulty of it too. Compared to some other films, this is a rare one I think. To sum up, I enjoyed watching this so that I want to recommend my family or friends to see it. I hope almost people will like it.",8,0,0,1 October 2013
The Terminator," Wow
","A strange man comes to the earth from somewhere. We all think he is crazy, because he does not wear any clothes. He has much power, and people can't fight against him. Some women are killed by him, and one lady is being target of him even she does nothing. Is she alright? Who is going to save her and stop him? This story is very thrilling, but has some emotional parts. I like the way to show that the strange man is very strong. He is in good shape, and also does not smile at all. When I thought of the time that this man comes to the real word, I could help feeling fearful. However, this happening is never occurred in this world, so I could enjoy watching the film. On the other hand, the content is a little bit complicated for me, especially, the relationships among people. One more thing I was surprised to see is that there are some grotesque scenes in the film. If you don't want to see blood or this kind of scenes, I recommend you to close your eyes, actually I did so. On the whole, it was thrilling, so for me, person who likes sort of this, it made me enjoy.",7,1,4,1 October 2013
Life of Pi," It's like a real
","This story is about the life of a man and a lion. They drift, and survive together. At first, there are some animals like chimpanzee, zebra and hyena, but they don't have any other way to survive except killing each other. The life of the man 'Pi' and the lion start. In this story, there are three religions which Pi believes. He believes in Christianity, Hinduism and Islam. Through watching them surviving, we can find some religious things. I mean we can learn about religions. It's worth watching, because there is a scene which Pie is forced to kill fish by himself and eat it even though he is vegetarian. I think this scene makes us think of the situation deeply. In fact I thought that if I were him, what I would do. I want to know other people's opinions about these religious things, because I am Japanese, and don't have any religions to believe. On the whole, it is worth thinking by watching this film. I hope I can recommend this to my friends.",9,1,3,1 October 2013
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Scary
","In this film, two terminators are appeared. One is the same person as the first one. The new terminator is trying to catch 'John' who is the son of the woman who appeared on the previous one. This strong terminator also looks like human, but actually he is made by metal, so he is not killed easily. The previous terminator must save John. Can he succeed to save him? How do they try to kill the new one? Through this film, I felt a little bit fear, because so many people are killed by guns. I should not do, but since I watched the first terminator, I cannot help comparing these two. They have lots of similarities even the story is different. If you will see this, please try to look for some similarities. I wrote the same thing on the review of the first terminator, but there are some grotesque scenes. It is very interesting to watch, but please be careful. The reason why I think it is grotesque is that the way to express how scary is very good. I think people can enjoy watching it because the quality is high.Of course I enjoyed it too.",8,1,1,1 October 2013
Inception," Complicated!
","This film is very complicated and difficult story I have ever seen. Secret agent that has advanced technical skill gets into people's dream to steal other people's ideas. One day an impossible mission comes to them and try to succeed the mission 'Inception' In the ending, we need to guess what's going to happen. The main actor is Leonardo Dicaprio, and from Japan, Ken Watanabe acts the most important role. As I said at the beginning, it is too hard for me to understand the story completely, because this story shows the real world and future. I sometimes did not understand which world I'm watching. I watched it with my friend, so we asked each other 'Is it a dream?' like this. However, it is very high quality so that I could not follow the plot of the story. If I were clever, I could have got the story! Totally it's worth watching, so if I can, I want to watch it again.",7,0,1,1 October 2013
The Social Network," Great thing
","This film is about how facebook is created. A main person is Mark Zuckerberg, and he goes to Harvard University. The start of making facebook is a small thing. However, the story is based on the real story, so I thought it is worth watching it. So many people in the world have their own facebook now, and so do I, so after I watched this film, I was glad to know the progress of it. Also I understood that Mark is such a great person to make facebook, because it spread all over the world like I said. It is about the man going to university, so there are of course Mark's friends appeared. The cooperate to create it. It's very unbelievable that they make them and earn so much money. Actually now I am an university student and almost same age as them. However I don' t have any confidence to do. After I watched it, I thought I have to be thankful to them for making these kind of very interesting Social Network.",Null,0,1,1 October 2013
