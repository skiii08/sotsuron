Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino is a genius.
","Kill Bill Volume 2 shows the continuation of the Bride's (Uma Thurman) quest to kill Bill (David Carradine) as well as the rest of his deadly viper assasination squad: Budd (Michael Madsen) and Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah).  The movie has great cinematic style as it harkens back to the '70's Kung fu flicks as well as many of the elements prevalent in the spaghetti westerns.  Tarantino seems to draw the best out of the actors that he directs witness the return of David Carradine.  He also has a unique storytelling style that never seems to lose steam or viewer interest.  The fight choreograhpy while not as prevalent as Volume 1 is still masterful and a wonder to watch.  The music, which was done by the RZA of the Wu Tang Clan, is awesome and helps to create the kung fu atmosphere.",Null,0,1,27 April 2004
Alexander," Troy was more entertaining
","This film was fairly accurate to most historical accounts but as far as entertainment, which should be the purpose of all movies (in other words you shouldn't be going to the movies to learn about history Hollywood while remaining fairly accurate does take dramatic liberties with certain things that can distort what actually happens) this movie fails miserably. I sat in my seat for most of the movies three hour length wondering when it was going to end. Probably the most controversy being raised over the movie is of the so called homosexual scenes. First, it is important to remember that the idea of homosexuality did not exist in the lexicon of ancient times. It was not uncommon in ancient Greece for men to have male lovers but they did not for the most part forsake their wives for these male lovers. So yes Alexander probably had a male lover, was it a dramatic event between he and his wife when she finds out, most definitely not. Colin Farrel does a fair job of playing Alexander and seems to channel a range of emotions that we have never seen in a character that Farrell has played. A particularly good scene occurs when Alexanders army is threatening to desert him and he lashes out at his men. Colin Farrell does however seem to overact in certain scenes that could have been more low key. In some respects he plays Alexander as though he is constantly on the battlefield. Angelina Jolie channels her inner psychopath (this seems to be fairly regular for her now) playing Alexanders mother Olympus. She is a constant reminder in Alexanders life that whatever he achieves he will never be good enough. She would have it were he to rule the entire world. Angelina Jolie does a good job for the most part in her character. The best actor in the movie with probably the most realistic portrayal is Val Kilmer as Alexanders father Philip of Macedonia. His scenes are well acted especially those where he is teaching Alexander the ways to be a good king. The movie as directed by Oliver Stone comes off as one big surreal experience. Stone attempts way to much imagery in the film leaving the viewer confused as to what the heck these symbols actually are supposed to represent. Stone does have an interesting way of telling the story. The story is not so much told chronologically but rather events are expressed as they become important to the life of Alexander and as far as that goes Stone does a wonderful job. However overall the portrayal that Stone presents of Alexander seems just a bit too dramatic rather than a purely historical viewpoint. The problem is that we never become attached to Alexander as a character in the way that Stone wants us to. In short if you're looking for an entertaining movie dealing with the ancient greeks I would recommend Troy. If you enjoy over the top acting and dramatic crying scenes with odd imagery then by all means see this movie. I give it 6/10",Null,0,1,30 November 2004
Snatch," movie was one of the best action/comedies in years
","This movie was the best film by Guy Ritchie, although Lock Stock was a very good movie as well.  Jason Statham and Dennis Farina both turn in awesome performances. The one performance that I feel is of note though is that of Brad Pitt as Mickey.  He defintely makes the movie much more entertaining.  Guy Ritchie is defintely the British version of Quentin Tarantino, I won't count the Swept Away which I feel was just a way for Guy Ritchie to score points with his wife by putting him in one of his films.  The story in Snatch is also fantastic and is not hard to follow at all.  The editing in the movie was also superb and helped the movie to move along rather smoothly.",Null,0,1,1 December 2003
American Beauty," Makes You Think
","The thing that I like about this movie is that it challenges us as viewers to look past what is presented directly to our eyes and see a deeper meaning or truth.  The events in the actual movie seem to just further this plot and to connect us to those themes of love after marriage, and happiness in adulthood.  Kevin Spacey does a phenomenal job as Lester Burnham, an unhappily married man seeking to relive some of the joy he experienced when he was young and everything seemed so innocent.  The one downside I would say is that Annette Benning does not play good as disgruntled aspiring career woman Carolyn Burnham.  She seems to be overacting and like she really has to reach for the scenes when she is expected to conjure a natural emotion.  Sam Mendes did a wonderful job directing the movie and the editing and use of the color red in the film was awesome.  I give this move an 8 out of 10",Null,0,1,9 May 2004
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," Not as good as the first but not as bad as the third
","The book wasnt as good as Jurassic Park so why on earth would they make a movie out of it.  They could have just left well enough alone but no that wouldn't be very Hollywood of them.  Anyway lets focus on the good aspects of the movie. They introduce alot of different dinosaurs in this one which makes for some pretty cool action sequences. The theme that life finds a way continues into this movie making for discoveries of how the animals have survived untouched on this Site B when they should have died due to the way they were bred. Some of the dialogue is funny although most of it was not supposed to be. It comes off as funny when spoken by the characters. Now for the bad, there is nary a well acted part in this movie especially not from Julianne Moore whom I have never been a big fan of.  The entire dinosaur in the city sequence was not that great and in hindsight was probably a little too godzilla-ish. This movie is worth seeing at least once.",Null,0,0,3 August 2004
Black Hawk Down," More Relevant Today than Ever.
","ahh the paralells that can be drawn between this film and the situation in Iraq.  This film could have been a documentary using Hollywood actors as the camera work is superb as well as the editing. The film focuses on the U.S. invasion of Somalia to capture a warlord who is starving his people in a vicious civil war. What the movie basically shows though is that war is indeed hell and that anything can happen at any given moment.  The camera herks and jerks around to follow the action and even if it is not, the camera appears to be hand held.  The movie also is edited to build dramatic tension and on the other hand to show in full video the horrors that American soldiers face even today.  This film deserves a 6 out of 10.",Null,0,0,2 May 2004
Love Actually," Good in its genre
",the movie was definitely a solid effort when you look at it simply as a romantic comedy.  The story was well formulated and I think that some of the actors did a tremendous job especially Colin Firth and AlanRickman.  There are few great laugh out loud moments in the film but it does present important themes about love that are not present in similiar films in its genre.  However there are a number of story lines where the plot is so cliche such as in the scene where Hugh Grant and his assistant pander back and forth in several meaningless scenes through out the film.  The film is still a solid first directorial piece by Richard Curtis and is definitely worth looking into.  I give this movie 7 out of 10 stars,Null,0,2,9 May 2004
The Matrix," Has changed Movies forever.
",This film is definitely the Star Wars of this generation.  The plot of the movie revolving around perception versus reality draws all types of paralells ranging from philosophy to religion.  The motion effect that was used in the film adds intensity to the action and makes the action  almost surreal.  The writing is fantastic and the story line draws viewers. The only downside is that because of it's success we not get the ever present copycat syndrome where every movie tries to be just like the matrix.  The movie does have plenty of action and the gun fights and martial arts are choreographed to perfection.  The lobby scene is one that people will remember long after the film itself has become irrelevant.,Null,0,1,27 April 2004
Jurassic Park," Dinosaurs done right
","Finally, when this movie was made in the early 1990's we finally had the computer technology to create a dinosaur that didn't look like some guy in a rubber suit. The realistic dinosaurs or at least what we can guess is as real as we will ever see are what makes this movie great. The cast isn't that great with the lone stand alone being Sam Neill as Dr. Alan Grant.  The rest of the cast arent really academy award material.  This movie only pulls off because it is a great idea dinosaurs and humans together and the chaos that ensues.  The animal effects are great especially the velociraptor scenes in the kitchen and the visitor center.  All this things are part of a greater whole that at the time was something bigger than any movie goer had seen at the time. That is what makes movies great is the ability to amazie everyone in the theater and to touch everyone no matter what the age.",Null,0,1,3 August 2004
