3:10 to Yuma," Too many holes
","This movie gets three points (out of ten) from me because I am inclined to give Westerns two points more than they actually deserve.What was Russel Crowe thinking when he accepted this role? The script has so many holes that you'll go insane. Never mind the the plot, the characters, the laughable attempts at psychology, because you will be continuously wondering 'Ok, so they are bringing a dangerous criminal to justice, so why in the name of everything sacred don't they tie up and gag the man properly?!' PS: Should you have any braincells left after watching this movie on DVD, be sure to to check out the Deleted Scenes. That way you will at least end this experience on a high note, laughing at the ordeal of the scriptdoctors who must have known they were flogging a dead horse.",3,2,6,16 January 2008
Fight Club," Sleepy
","In the company of my brother and a friend we started to watch this film. The friend left, bored, and went to bed. My brother fell asleep. I barely managed keep my eyes open and see it through. We must've missed something, considering the raving reviews of other users... or maybe we were just very tired.",5,1,4,30 March 2000
Shakespeare in Love," Americanized to the max...
","If your brain is more than 3 percent active during the first 60 seconds of this film, your general Hollywood-crap-detection-alarm will sound: Take notice of the man in the street shouting something like 'What's in a name...' (followed by a reference to a theatre called or renamed 'The Rose'). Of course, you see the young Shakespeare dude making a mental note: 'Why, that's not a bad one liner for my next play... What's in a name.. quite good, jolly good, in fact.. Must remember that.. Might come in handy'Need I say more!?",4,4,9,6 May 2000
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Boring, plastic people
","LOVE STORY: unbelievably unconvincing and boringPLOT: n/aGRAPHICS: not very inspired this timeACTION: occasionally good, most of the time you think 'what's the point'.
LIGHT SABRE USAGE: MOST UNCOOL!!SPOILER: expect to see a muppet and a senior citizen battle it out with telekinesis and neon signs.",1,56,115,23 December 2002
Being John Malkovich," SURPRISE... !!
","When I finally went to see this movie, I wasn't aware of the plot and I hadn't read any reviews.Therefore it TOTALLY and UTTERLY surprised me, being the BRILLIANT movie that it is!Unfortunately, I'm sorry to say, it won't be such a surprise for *you* anymore, having read this spoiler-review... :-)I think we may have touched on one of the few disadvantages of checking out a movie before you go see it.",9,0,1,15 July 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Dear God! War *is* hell...
","My god, the first 30 minutes are... indescribable. There are so many horrible details that come back to haunt your mind later.. The shouts.. the blood... Hits you right between the eyes, or in the heart, burns scars into your memory...After this, who can watch starspangled movies like 'The Longest Day' or the 'Guns of Navarone' without laughing at those pathetic attempts to describe war?",10,0,0,6 May 2000
The Game," No high score for me in this game
","Well, to put it on the table: I hate this movie. It is utterly unlikely and boring. It is also very, very, very American. You must be American (or paranoid) to believe that this sort of manipulation of someone's life is at all possible.Having said this, I must admit that I have a friend who would have loved this movie. But he is a fan of Stephen King. So that doesn't count.",1,16,35,19 October 1998
The Truman Show," Must see-again movie
","I would like to mention the fun I had, watching the little details in the background, such as the poster that depicts a plane being hit by lighting.The caption below it is : 'This could happen to you!The funny thing is of course that it happens to be hanging on the wall inside a travel agency.",9,0,0,15 July 2000
