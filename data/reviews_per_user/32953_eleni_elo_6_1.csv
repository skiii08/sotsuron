","The movie was not what I expected at first. By watching it , I really thought it was a good action movie. Most action movies I have seen I thought this was one of my top movies. By using the actors Whedon has used made this movie even better.. The actors that played Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Hulk( Mark Ruffalo), Captain America(Chris Evans ) , Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr. ), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye( Jeremy Renner )and Loki(Tom Hiddleston ) . Worked really well together and got to show their own strength in the movie. The evil Loki didn't really get to show that much of his evil. I think they should of showed more of his evil side. It mostly looked like it followed the story line of Thor because it was mostly about him and Loki. When I watched this Black Widow and Haweye I didn't really know because they didn't have their own movie outside of this movie and I don't really read comics but by seeing this movie it made me want to watch more of this kind of movies. I would watch this movie again. The special effects were really good it went well with catching the audience's attention and to keep watching it. I think they should of changed the setting of the battle that happened in Manhattan, where the bad guys went against the heroes .The ending kind of made you think there was going to be a second one coming out, and not leave you hanging like most other movies. The best scene I think was the best in the movie was when all of them were stopping the portal thing that Loki had opened and they all came together.It showed how even though they have different techniques on fighting there enemy that can still help each other and defeat the enemy. Most people would like to watch this movie even if they aren't into action movies.",9,1,4,15 November 2012
