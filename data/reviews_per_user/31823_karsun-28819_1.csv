Blade Runner 2049," Wow! Loved it! Visually stunning!
","This movie is not for people who love mindless car/space ship chases, over the top action sequences, cheesy dialogues and opulent costumes and sets. This is a slow, introspective, highly engrossing SF masterpiece. I watched in one sitting which I hardly do with any other movie. BTW, I fall asleep with almost all super-hero movies.
I wish our world was something as abstract as the movie. Everyone acted beautifully. Two days after, I am still thinking about the movie. Love it!",10,3,11,18 March 2018
