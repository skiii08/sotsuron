Walk the Line," Hats Off To Mr.Mangold
","I didn't know what to expect whilst buying this movie in my local media shop. I made my decision entirely upon the critics making a fuss of this 'movie epic', not knowing what to expect i decided to take a chance not expecting much greatness.However I was blown away by this touching, personal and painful portrait of Johnny Cash's life. He is a musician i know little about and have been recommended by many others but never have been adventurous enough to buy his LPs And CDs. With fantastic performances from both Joaquin Pheonix and Reese Witherspoon, Walk The Line was brought to life. Telling the tale of his life starting on a cotton farm in Arkansas to worldwide fame. Through love, through pain, through the music Walk The Line is a sure winner for all.",8,2,2,26 March 2008
Saving Private Ryan," Fantastic, Engaging, Emotional But Still A Little Empty
","Mr. Spielberg used all of his directing skill and research into the picture to perfect true war experience. A real feat for a man who had never tasted the terror and insanity of war before, even fire live rounds into hunks of meat to create the best sound of getting shot. Now thats devotion. The story line is a heroic one, a day for all American citizens to stand up proud on veterans day 60 years on, Yet Saving Private Ryan lacks that story line that delivers on all aspects. Maybe I'm being untrue comparing a movie to a TV series, but Band Of Brothers also by Spielberg is a better fulfilling, satisfying storyline, A company of soldiers travelling from Curahee in Georgia USA to Berlin. The ones who made it, the ones who didn't. You remembered. So Saving Private Ryan has changed war films forever. Thank you",Null,2,3,27 March 2008
Million Dollar Baby," Dreams, Hopes and Loss, Million Dollar Baby is a sure winner
","Million Dollar Baby was watched by myself and my mum just last night. Between us we knew nothing of boxing or the world that lived within its grasp, so we were anxious of the outcome of a boxing movie that had fantastic reviews. But Clint Eastwood didn't let us down. Million Dollar proved an insightful, honest and beautifully captured picture. With top-notch performances all round especially from Hillary Swank getting Best Lead Female Role in a film at the Oscars and Best Supporting Male Actor from Morgan Freeman also at the Oscars. The point is don't be discouraged from watching this film from your lack of boxing knowledge, this film perhaps from a point of view like myself is critical of the sport saying how barbaric and inhuman hitting each other is. Million Dollar Baby is a sure winner for all.",9,3,4,26 March 2008
The Shawshank Redemption," The Honest, The Emotional, The Best
","My family told me this film was a deeply philosophical film which required mature minds to be able to understand. I couldn't disagree more. The Shawshank Redemption is about a man going to prison after being found guilty of murder of his wife, later to be discovered he was wrongly convicted. The story goes from Robbins being a small fish in a big pond in the prison to being a respected figure throughout the film and various events happening along the way. This picture is the only to make me lie awake at night thinking about life and its dreams. I cried during Shawshank and I'm proud of it, I've never felt so passionate about life and its important things. The Shawshank Redemption is about Love For Friends, Hope, Death, Humanity and Loss. Thank You",10,0,0,26 March 2008
