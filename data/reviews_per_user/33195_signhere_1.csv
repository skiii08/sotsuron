The Blair Witch Project," Finally! A Scary Horror Film... PURELY Brilliant
","It's great to see a smart Horror film made. This film will have you laughing out loud and will scare the crap out of you... That is HARD TO DO!This film will have you becoming friends with the 'stars' and you will feel that you are with them along their trip into the woods, and when things start to get weird you are feeling them getting weird too.The film style is Brilliant.There is not much I can think of to say to keep you away from this film, EVERYONE should see it. Our group drove two and a half hours to see it and would drive 20 hours if we had to, to see it again.Forget about Eyes Wide Shut, your Eyes will be WIDE OPEN while watching this Masterpiece! Find it in a theater now and go see it!",10,1,2,17 July 1999
