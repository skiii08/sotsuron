50 First Dates," I thought the movie was sweet and the love shared in the movie was beautiful....
","This was an EXCELLENT movie.I just wish that i had the love that Henry (Adam Sandler) and Lucy (Drew Barrymore) had,I'd do anything for that love.I thought that was sweet how even though he knew that she would never remember him he kept making her fall in love with him over and over,it truly was one of the best movies of the year.The actors did a wonderful job portraying their characters.Drew Barrymore made the story seem so real with her acting skills.As for Adam Sandler...His movies always are the best,and this one is no exception.The other actors/actresses who were in this movie also added to the comedy of the film.Anyone who hasn't seen this movie it is a true-must-see film.I've seen it once and plan to go buy it soon.I rated this movie a 10/10.I gave it a higher rating than i normally give movies because this movie was special...it had romance,comedy,and everything all mixed into one awesome movie.So please if you haven't seen this movie..rent it,watch it,enjoy it....and then go buy it.",10,0,0,28 July 2004
