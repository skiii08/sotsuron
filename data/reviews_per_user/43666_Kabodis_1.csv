The Blair Witch Project," most over-hyped flick on the face of the planet!
","Everybody told me I gotta see this movie. They told me, 'Man! the end is so scary, you gotta see it!'.Well, I just saw this movie last night, and I tell yah I was far from impressed.I dunno. Maybe trees can be a pretty scary thing to someone who was born and has since then, lived their entire life in a city. While I watched this thing all I see is a bunch of city-slickers making fools out of themselves out in the bush somewhere. I mean, maybe the witch was able to alter the geography or somethin, but I'm sayin if you got a fuctioning compass, you would have to be pretty dim to loose yourself out in the bush.As for the realism, the non-acting method of the three main characters is somewhat effective but I would hardly commend it. I mean people with this kind of ability are a dime a dozen.And as for the budget, I dunno maybe these guys got swindled by whoever did the film transfer and the scene editing, but $30 000 seems kind of high.If you want to see a truly effective use of a low-budget watch El Mariachi instead.The fact that this film was in the theaters is also a sign of the state of decay that hollywood is now in. Movie production costs have gotten out of control. Actors believe it is their birth-right to receive 10s of millions of dollars per picture. And the studios while managing this kind of money, are now too timid to make anything that is ground-breaking anymore. I mean 'blair witch' Is a decent indy-flick and it did make its rounds and got some praise at the film festivals, but I believe it has no place at the multiplexes.I'm sayin this film was a good first attempt by the director(s) and could have been used as a stepping into the mainstream, however, this film on it's own just don't cut it.thats all I have tuh say about that.",Null,1,2,29 October 2001
