The Avengers," A for Absolutely Awesome
","I was quite worried about the early trailers and storyline behind this film, after continuing a story line based on the cube in the movie Captain America first avenger, which was an atrocious movie. I was also worried about the casting of captain America, i was afraid that he would ruin the entire movie for me if he wasn't given good lines and action sequences. But i had faith in Joss Whedon having been a fan of the firefly, i believed if anyone could make the avengers it would be him...........and he did! The movie was a complete both in pleasing the viewers and the an earning millions of dollars profit. Already it has beaten harry potter DH part 2 and Avatar in both opening nights and weekends and box office records. Alright now to the movie itself. The acting was fabulous in most parts, Robert Downey doing showing us once again what a great choice it was to cast him as Ironman, delivering hilarious lies and portraying tony stark brilliantly. Chris Hemsworth, loved him. Not much credit goes to this young star but i think he does Thor brilliantly. Mark Ruffalo was great as the roll of Bruce banner, though i probably prefer Ed Norton, the lines were specifically chosen to fit Mark Ruffalo(Thanks to Joss Whedon). The hulk itself was quite cool, though at parts looked fake was a good CGI impersonation of mark Ruffalo, the hulk was sensational character and hilarious at parts as well. Tom Hiddleston, the villain Loki, was sensational as well. He was a well crafted villain from the start, though i wish at some parts they made more of a confident bad guy who feared nothing rather than a crazy villain at parts. Chris Evans, finally came into the roll of captain America( due to good lines and development of his character. The other characters fitted in there part not overly special though. OK fight scenes, wonderfully crafted and directed. Hulk vs Thor was an epic fight scene which it should have been having the two most powerful marvel characters in a fight against each other. The Thor vs Ironman was very good except that Ironman would not stand a chance against Thor in the comics, However nothing compares to the action sequence at the end, with this epic action scene comes some cool and lines and comedy moments the avengers must defend the city against an alien attack. beautifully directed again and incredible graphics come together to make this awesome fight which was one of the best action sequences iv seen. So don't sit around, get 10 bucks and go down to the cinema and watch this movie and enjoy the action scenes,the wonderful script and comedy.",9,3,8,2 June 2012
