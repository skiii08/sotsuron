Vertigo," The first hour drags, just a little. But then it picks up and keeps gaining speed.
","Vertigo, I feel takes a bit too long to get where it's going in the first half. (Although I may feel differently when I watch it again). But to me a lot of it, (the first half) felt kind of like 'character set up' material from a TV series, that would be put in between other scenes of other characters doing other stuff, so interest would be maintained. Whilst I didn't get bored exactly, I went from completely intrigued in the first 30 minutes to less and less until the death from the church tower.The cinematography is brilliant, but does anyone need to point that out, it is Hitchcock after all. But I loved the way he shot San Francisco, he really truly knows how to romanticize cities by shooting them beautifully. Sure the fact that now this is more then 50 years on, so it's 'San Fran 50 years ago' adds to the romanticism, but it's still wouldn't soar to the levels it does without the cinematography.I'm not sure if James Stewart was supposed to be a bit of a jerk, but when he pulls Novak up the stairs in the end and the argue, then they kiss. It sure wasn't a 'Happily Ever After' kiss, which would've made the ending ALL the more effective.The end, even the way it was is just brilliant though, unexpected and dark. People went on and on about 'The Mists' ending, which I feel just make the characters in it idiots, but this was shocking.Great, deserving of it's accliam and will be an eternal classic.9/10(Reviewed after first Viewing)",9,2,3,24 July 2008
Spider-Man 3," Definitely enjoyable, but a pretty big letdown.
","Seven is being generous. I want to give this 6.5, but I can't. 6 seems too little though.I'm not going to say anything that hasn't been said by lets face it every review on here, so I'm just going to write this in point form.The action sequences were AWESOME, but some of the effects weren't. Like parts with Spidey getting thrown through the buildings, and the glass just looks lame. Although I understand that this is because the parts that look good, look REALLY good. (Birth of Sandman, certain parts with the black suit).Obviously there was just too much going on. Besides the multiple enemy's, there was the MJ conflict too. If it was just Sandman, Green Goblin and Harry playing games with MJ and Peter as well as the Gwen Stacey stuff, it could've surpassed Spidey 2 easily.In relation to the last point, Eddie Brock could've just been introduced in this to set up a fourth movie. They could've also keep that under wraps so the fan boys could've eaten it up upon their first viewing.The actual SPIDERMAN (text) logo used for the films was used IN the movie. During the parade for him, above the stage, and I believe that in the message Venom wrote for him in the black web, the Spidey Animated Series logo was used. Seriously God damn cheesy!!.Yeah, I can't be bothered writing anymore. Just wish this was all it could've been.*Shakes Fist*7/10(reviewed after first viewing)",6,0,1,15 July 2008
Silent Hill," The Good Bits Were Good. But As A Whole, It Doesn't Keep Up With The Good Bits.
","Halfway through watching this for the second time (late at night on cable, having seen it a couple of years ago in the cinema when it first came out). I found myself thinking 'I remember this being a lot better'. It definitely picks up later on in the film, with some VERY well shot scenes of creepy goodness. As well as the story coming together in an acceptable way.Parts that stand out, being the scene in the toilets when 'the darkness' comes, and the paint/reality peels away, and the wired up guy crawls out. The dude with the big sword...the dragging sound was supringly effective. And of course the hot dead nurses.The bad... The fact that Radah Mitchelles character doesn't seem overly concerned that she's lost her daughter in this demon world. I know I'd be running around in hysterics if I was in that situation. This is especially cringe worthy as it is after all, a film based on a video game, and it really should try at ALL costs to maintain it's credibility.I also didn't quite dig the characterisation of the cop. When she cuffs Radah's character, and then doesn't take them off AS SOON as she realises that not everything is quite right. (The road that she drove into silent hill on no longer being there). Your meant to like her, and this makes you dislike her, especially if you have a disdain for cops in the real world as it is already.Overall, it's decent with some great scenes, but the film falls far from greatness all together. Will probably buy it one day when I see it for $10-$15.P.S. Radah Mitchell's Aussie accent was really obvious, when she was screaming 'Sharon, Sharon!'. Perhaps not the best word for an Aussie trying to maintain an American accent to say repeatedly. And I think I should mention the very opening shot, just of Mitchell, calling out for her daughter, it kind of jolts you into the film in a not-so-blatant way, but extremely effective. (I think her accent was good in that part too, it's more so when she first gets to Silent Hill that it falls apart)7/10(reviewed after second viewing)",7,0,0,20 July 2008
Knocked Up," Elements of Realism Abound.
","Wow, I love this movie.The one thing I really feel for Apatows movies is that, he captures little moments of realism. Along with realism to do with relationships as a whole, be it sexual, marriage or friendship.I don't know why more people haven't said that.From the part where Leslie Mann is screaming at the door man and see screams 'door man, door man'. To when Paul Rudd and Rogan are on mushrooms and their back and forward banter shows that they've definitely had psychedelics before.I've read a whole bunch of reviews that complain about the unrealisticness of a guy like rogans character getting a girl Heigel's. But people, it really isn't all that unrealistic at all.The movie has a whole lot of 'classic moments'. A lot of them being in the last half an hour, being one of the main strenghts of the movie, especially in terms of re-watch value.Truly a bad review, sorry. But ultimately I love this movie because of the realistic HUMAN elements to it.9/10(reviewed after fifth or sixth viewing)",8,2,2,5 July 2008
The Dark Knight," Bringing back credibility to the action blockbuster...
","Just got back from seeing this, I was originally going to see it after the w/e, but I was bored today so I watched 'Begins', then I had to go see this as soon as I could.There is very little that's bad with this movie. The acting, the pacing, the score (including the levels at which it played at the suitable times), the lack of CGI messing up scenes, a MUCH better Rachel Dawes, it goes on....quite a bit. But what would be the point of repeating such praise again and again in these IMDb user comments.The only things that I didn't dig so much, and this one goes for Begins as well, is that Gotham City doesn't look right. Pretty much the only thing Burton did right was gotham city (and I also liked the way he portrayed it's inhabitants), I do have a feeling that it was done as to not mirror the Burton films though. Also Two Face actually becoming fully bad could've been kept until the third movie too. It would've gone really well with the whole flow of the saga, because unlike ALL other (superhero) comic book film adaptions, the villains carry on and the films are linked by them. It's not just new villain who dies at the end, because thats not how the comics work. So yeah, he could've just crawled from the wreck after he shot the driver, and left the audience unsure of what exactly happened to him.I'll have to wait and see how it flows into the third installment though, it may end up working really well.I liked the way you expected the BatCave, but it wasn't there, which again adds to the flow of the saga....I like the fact that the 'batmobile' was destroyed, so hopefully there's a new design for three cos I really disliked this Batmobile even though it sounded awesome.I'll have to see it again to make up my mind on the, sonar phone watching centre. Not because of the plausibility of it, but more-so the morality. I need to see if Batman was pained by having to do that, because in my opinion, loss of civil rights/human rights is much much worse then death. The scene seemed to say that if it's necessary, it's necessary which is blergghh. They could've just had all the phones in Gotham being monitored, but just by audio, had a continuous track on the Jokers voice print (which are much more unique then fingerprints) and then for it to come up only when it was found, and then only on that call as to not destroy individuals privacy.Even with all the negatives I mentioned it still deserves a 9.5 . God I wish you could give half points, I want to give many things half points.....10 perhaps if it wasn't for the phone issue, but yeah. Great film.9/10(Reviewed after first viewing)",9,4,9,18 July 2008
Jaws," Thankfully, Spielberg hasn't re-released this, replacing Jaws teeth with walkie talkies.
","Jaws is great. There's not much else to say. Everything works, the location, the actors and their chemistry with one another, the way it's was shot...everything.The only thing that one can complain about, is that there should've been more talk about how this was an anomaly in nature. Sharks don't purposefully attack people. Obviously the whole point of the movie is that there is a shark that attacks people willfully. To maintain credibility it should've really driven that point home on a few occasions.This was the movie that started the BIGGG Hollywood blockbuster. It's too bad that not even 50% of the big summer blockbusters released today even come close to touching the quality of the film making in 'Jaws'.9/10 (It'd be ten if it had given itself full credibility).(reviewed after 5+ (at least) viewings)",9,1,3,25 July 2008
Rear Window," Even if just for the first shot of Grace Kelly. Watch Rear Window.
","I saw Rear Window when I was about twelve for the first time. I remember thinking it was good, I liked the story itself as well as realising that a huge chunk of the films awesomeness stems from it's ability to put you right there in the apartment with Mr Jefferies.I just watched it again last night, and now being 24 I see a whole lot more. This film is so finely crafted, I'd say it's perfect shot for shot. If there are any qualms that I have with the movie, it's just that Thorwald doesn't cover his eyes after the second or even the third flash that Jimmy Stewart sends his way.I think for many people my age, the mood to watch many of these pre 60's films, comes about much differently then the feeling of wanting to watch something newer. I don't know, perhaps it's the sass of the jaw droppingly hot female leads (Kelly in this being a GREAT example, holding her self as a proud woman when it wasn't so common, makes you think many many dirty dirty thoughts(but in a good way, lol)). The pacing the colouring, the dialog, etc. Pretty much, American artistic produce was just so damn good in the 50's. The original EC comics(Tales From the Crypt, Vault of Horror, ShockSuspenStories etc.), the cars, the clothes(for girls, it's weird how stuff that was supposed to be modest, seems so hot today, the way it showed of curves etc. Pretty much more sexual then a really short mini skirt)OK, now I'm off topic. Good movie. One that EVERYONE that has ever enjoyed any film should watch. 10/10(reviewed after third (maybe only second, but first time within ten years at least anyway) viewing)",10,1,4,2 July 2008
