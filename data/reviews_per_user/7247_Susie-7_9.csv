The Blair Witch Project," Wow.
","First, I'd like to say that there are spoilers in this review, although I will warn again right before I give them.This movie scared the crap out of me, which is very unusual.  I am usually only creeped out if I watch a movie at home alone in the dark in the middle of the night; in this case, I saw the movie with friends in a crowded theatre and it was still light out when we exited the theatre.  Admittedly, I wasn't petrified at first.  When we really got scared was when we were walking back to our hotel (as we were visiting a friend of mine) in an area that seemed to have an aversion to street lights.  It was very dark and it did not help that we were walking by bushes.  We were all totally freaked out and kept looking around behind us.  We had the last scene of the movie stuck in our heads, and it stayed there.  I am somewhat embarrassed to admit that I had to leave a light on when I went to sleep.  I haven't done that since I was 7 and saw an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, where the almost-final image of a girl hung outside on the door of her home stayed with me for days.  Any movie that can have this kind of an effect on me is pretty unusual.  Even now, when I'm thinking about the final scene of this movie, I am getting somewhat creeped out.  The movie was highly disturbing, simply because it seemed so real and we DON'T actually know what happened. I am also with the group that thinks the acting was good; I think that in many cases they weren't acting.  For example [WARNING: spoilers ahead!!!], when that one guy disappeared in the middle of the night, I would not be surprised at all if the other two did not know that was going to happen. Likewise, at the very end of the film, I wouldn't be surprised if the girl didn't know when she'd enter the basement, Mike would be standing in the corner.  It really seemed to me like she was having a massive panic attack, at more than one point in the movie.In any case, I highly recommend this film to anyone that wants to be scared out of their wits.",8,1,1,23 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," To the critical people: Star Wars had the same supposed flaws.
","The things I have to say have already been said here, but because of the huge number of comments on here, I'm sure many people don't read beyond the last day posted or so.  So I am going to repeat what I feel and what others have already said, in hopes that someone will actually read this.Yes, the acting was not particularly good.  But does anyone remember the acting in Star Wars? Hello, they cut a scene with Luke in it (with Biggs) because his acting was so bad.  And if I had to judge Harrison Ford's acting merits on that one movie, I'd have said his career wouldn't go very far. The dialogue often left something to be desired.  But since when did Star Wars ever have amazing, thought-provoking dialogue? If you want a movie with lots of talking, go see a romantic comedy.As far as comments that the special effects were not much better than those in the original Star Wars movies...  What bloody movie are you watching? Are you trying to tell us that Lucas could have created an underwater world in 1977? Are you trying to say that a Greedo, who looks like his head is made out of plastic, is as realistic-looking as Jar-Jar, or that the virtually immobile Jabba is as good as the new computer-generated one? Sorry, but I prefer my aliens to look like something out of this world, not someone in a costume.No plot? This movie is one of three, so Lucas took the chance to use Episode 1 largely as a set up for the next two movies.  It's not really meant as a stand-alone.  It's supposed to leave unanswered questions, like who the REAL menace is (note the title, 'PHANTOM Menace', for those who haven't figured out that the Trade Federation was not the enemy and who the enemy really is).  I also find it strange that some complain about no plot while others complain the plot is too complex- so which is it? Formulaic plot and characters? Of course.  But what was Star Wars, if not the ultimate formula movie? Polarized good versus evil, bad guy all in black, good guy in white, scoundrel-with-a-heart-of-gold, etc.  Star Wars was not original in any of its individual elements, only in the way it strung them together.  In any case, lack of originality does not make a movie bad; what is important is the way the story is told, not the events within it.I think over the last 22 years or so, some have developed an inaccurate view of Star Wars.  It seems like many people who loved Star Wars but didn't like the Phantom Menace have convinced themselves that all of these 'undesirable' characteristics weren't present in the original Star Wars.  This notion of Star Wars as a perfect movie seems to have developed simply because people enjoy it so much, and to acknowledge the deficits it has, if one insists that such things detract from a movie, would make them question just why they think this movie from their childhood is so wonderful.  But it is easy to do this with a new movie that doesn't have two decades of warm fuzzy memories built around it.Has anyone ever seen the English Patient? Well, there was a movie that was supposed to be about characters and dialogue and it was awful.  All they did was create characters I cared nothing about and even disdained.  The acting was good, but the plot lacked originality, and the dialogue clearly failed in making me feel for the characters.  Yet few say these things about a movie they liked.  Perhaps what is really happening is people don't like a movie and are simply looking for reasons, and it just so happens that some of the reasons they cite exist in the very movies they love so dearly. But then, maybe that's just my opinion.",8,7,9,12 June 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is NOT about the Trade Federation (and other misconceptions)
","I would just like to say, to all of those that seem to have missed the point of this movie, Episode I is NOT about the Trade Federation! However, I can understand why those not extremely familiar with the Star Wars universe would think that.  After the next two movies, I am sure that many will look back and go, 'Oh, I get it now'.  This movie begins the formation of the evil Empire that is so central to Episodes 4-6.  For those who may not have taken this away from the movie, I suggest you look at the cast from this movie and the cast from Jedi and note who the Emperor is, and it should become clear why this movie was only superficially about the Trade Federation.Aside from beginning the tale of the formation of the Empire, this movie also serves to introduce us to the next 2 movies, and this should be taken into consideration with respect to plot and character development.  This movie isn't meant as a stand-alone movie, though I enjoyed it in this respect anyway.As far as poor character development is concerned, it's true that none of the characters was greatly delved into, given that a large cast was introduced.  But let's look at the original Star Wars, shall we? Let's see... in the first movie, all we see of Luke is that he is whiny, Darth Vader is just bad without any apparent reason, and Leia and Han are primarily argumentative and stubborn.  It's not until Empire that any of the characters is truly flushed out, in my own opinion.  That is the compromise of a 2- hour movie that is only one of 3 parts; it is not possible to give us great insight into ten different characters' personalities within 2 hours in a movie that isn't dominated by dialogue.It has been mentioned by some that the Star Wars movies are contradicting themselves, because the Jedi council says that Anakin, at 10, is too old to begin his Jedi training, but Luke, at twice that age, becomes a Jedi.  I thought this was strange too, until my fiance (who is a rabid Star Wars fan; I'm not) that Yoda did, in either Empire or Jedi complain that Luke was too old.  And yes, it does take years to become a Jedi, but Luke a) did not finish his training (that I do remember Yoda complaining about), and b) is the Chosen One, so I'd assume he doesn't need as much training as an 'ordinary' Jedi.I also don't see why a 10 year-old Anakin needs to show some of the evil of Darth Vader.  As I understand from the Star Wars fans I'm surrounded by, Anakin does not turn to the Dark Side because of evil intent anyway, but out of impatience or something like that, and it is more that in turning to the Dark Side he is corrupted (any Star Wars fans who know this isn't the case or is inaccurate, please clarify for us lay folk).Anyway, I thought this was a good movie, and I think our opinions of it will improve once the trilogy is completed.",8,0,0,24 May 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Racism?
","This is just a little comment about the supposed racism in this film.  I personally did not find any of the characterizations very offensive, and enjoyed this movie quite a bit.  It is true that Lucas bestowed on some of the races a very Earth-like culture, some of which were not flattering. However, I did not find the characterizations of Jar-Jar and his people racist, because I did not feel that they were portrayed in a negative way. They were supposed to be brave warriors, they weren't stupid, and Jar-Jar's clumsiness and ineptness did not afflict the entire race.  It is true they were supposed to be somewhat primitive, but come on! How primitive can people with shield generators and spaceship-like boats that can go through the planet core be?The characterizations of the Huts as mobster Italians can certainly be construed as racist, but if a person says that, then they must also condemn dozens of other movies where the gangster types are all Italians.  I view the Huts Italian-ness is Lucas' way of instilling in the Huts a culture (or cultural stereotype) that we all know and understand, thus making it easy for us to understand the Huts.To me, the most racist characterization in the film is that of the members of the Trade Federation, whatever race they are.  It appears as if the inspiration behind their on-film culture is Japanese.  Yet the members of the Trade Federation do not show any admirable characteristics.  In fact, they don't seem to have much personality at all, other than obviously wanting to expand their territory at the expense of others, and being lackies to the future Emperor.  Still, I don't believe we're supposed to think they're rotten and evil, so much as opportunists.  But I may be wrong on that; maybe they are supposed to be dastardly.However, I am still not offended.  It seems to me that Lucas just wanted to make his different creatures distinct from each other in some respect other than appearance.  To do this, he imparted Earth cultures onto them, rather than creating new ones, which would no doubt resemble Earth cultures anyway. The problem in doing this is he has to pick cultures that we can recognise, that are distinct from our own Western culture, and consequently, when his creatures do bad things, some people associate these fictious creatures with real cultures and cry racism.  All I can say is that the main characters, i.e. Obi-Wan, Anakin etc., are pretty western, and they aren't all good. Anakin goes on to slaughter all kinds of people, as does the Emperor. However, because there are so many of these western characters in the films, one bad one does not get generalised to the entire group.  No one screams that the movies are sexist because all the bad guys are men either.  I don't think people should take movies so seriously.  Put the Political Correctness alarm away for 2 hours, and you'll find movies are much more enjoyable. If there is something absolutely despicable in a movie, then fine, complain about racism.  But I don't think that applies to this movie.  But then, I'm just some western white girl, so what would i know?",8,0,1,6 June 1999
12 Angry Men," Fantastic.
","I am not big on watching old movies, for many reasons.  Black and white does not bother me, but the poor film quality and the cheesy special effects (like using iguanas with stuff taped to them for dinosaurs), when there are any, are very distracting.  However, my biggest problems, and really the only ones that prevents me from watching a lot of them, are the overacting and the hokey dialogue.  This movie is one of the few of its day that I have seen that does not suffer from these problems (the others being mainly Hitchcock films- there was never any hokeyness in those).  Instead, it is a great character study.  The dialogue is believable.  Really the only thing that makes this movie unrealistic if it were to be set in the present day is the absence of non-white jurors (of which the remake took care of) and of women (which the remake did not address).  Other than that, this movie could easily have been made in 1999 instead of 1957.So for those who shy away from old movies, don't avoid this one, because it is easily one of the best films ever made (hence its ranking in the Top 250 on this site).  Yeah, so it's in black and white- so was Schindler's List, and parts of the Blair Witch Project.  There are no phony special effects to make fun of, no stilted dialogue, and no bad acting.  All in all, I give it a 9 (the only movie I've given a 10 to is Schindler's List).  That's saying something from a person who tends to abhor old films.Do not watch the remake: watch the original.",9,0,0,13 August 1999
The English Patient," Boring, boring, boring
","I cannot believe this movie won best picture.  Yes, it has nice cinematography and the acting is good, but it was far too long (for what the telling of the story accomplished) and very, very boring.  I thought the story focused too much on the relationship between Ralph Fiennes and Kristin Scott Thomas- a relationship I found myself not caring about at all, partly because Kristin Scott Thomas' character was not very likable- and not enough time on the relationship between Juliette Binoche and Naveen Andrews- characters I did like and was interested in.  Someone told me that in the novel, this relationship is stressed more than it is in the movie.  I don't know why, then, it was not really shown in the movie- if this was a matter of keeping the time down or if it was because they were unsure how the public would react to a multi-racial relationship, because for some reason there are still a lot of people out there that have problems with interracial relationships.  I really hope this wasn't the reason, because that would mean that not only did this movie suck, the creators also lacked integrity.  Anyway, like I said, the movie was too long, yet it seemed to do nothing with this time.  There were far too many shots where we apparently were supposed to gush at the scenery, time which could have been spent on, say, the relationship between Binoche and Andrews, or one making Kristin Scott Thomas' character seem less shallow.I cannot understand how this movie got nominated for best picture, never mind how it won.  I don't remember every movie that came out in 1996, but the other nominated pictures were better by far, even if they were not amazing films themselves.  Jerry Maguire was not a spectacular film, but it was certainly better than The English Patient.  Hey, even Independence Day and The Rock were more deserving of Oscars, because they at least were not boring. Twister had nifty special effects, such that even with its nonexistent storyline, it was more entertaining. There are very few movies I have seen that are as boring as The English Patient.  The only reason I didn't leave is because I paid to see it, that and I kept expecting it to get better, because of its accolades.  Instead I wound up very disappointed. This movie reminded me of reading a textbook- tedious and hard to pay attention to, with only odd bits of interest.  If you're the kind of person who enjoys reading textbooks in your spare time, this movie is for you. If not, pass this one over for better works by these talented actors, such as Schindler's List, Quiz Show, or Four Weddings and a Funeral.",2,7,14,21 March 1999
A Clockwork Orange," Be prepared for what you're going to get.
","It may seem strange that I'm writing a comment here, as I never watched the entire film.  I started watching the film and ended up feeling quite ill after a half hour.  I do intend one day to sit down and try watching this film again, because I am sure that, characteristic of Kubrick's work (as well as consistent with the other reviews contained on this site), there is an important message to be had.  My problem was that a friend grabbed the video out of her parents' collection; we had no clue whatsoever as to what this movie was about, and I was caught off guard.  If I'm going to handle being deeply disturbed for an entire film, I need to be prepared for it. That is my point: if you are going to watch this film for the first time, please realise what you're going to get.  This is not like '2001' or 'The Shining', where I don't think it matters if a person knows what to expect or not.  I do understand that part of the impact of a film comes from being caught off guard; if a person is too prepared for what is to come, the punch may lose all its force.  However, the point has no impact at all if a person can't stomach watching the movie long enough to get it.  So don't let your movie experience be ruined like mine: know what you're in for.For those people who think that people who enjoy movies like this are sick and deranged, I think it's important to consider how the word 'enjoy' is being used.  I don't use it myself when it comes to disturbing movies; I think Schindler's List is the best movie ever made, but I would not say I enjoyed it, in the sense of deriving pleasure from viewing it.  But others will use the word 'enjoy' to describe their experiences of such films, and that shouldn't be taken as them 'enjoying' murder, rape, genocide, or whatever other despicable act may be occurring on the screen.  I enjoy psychology, but that's not to say I enjoy others experiencing depression, schizophrenia, psychopathy, or anything else; it is a matter of enjoying the intellectual stimulation as well as the hope that out of studying such things something good will come, and I think this applies to movies.  To watch Schindler's List may give some empathy for victims of the Holocaust that they never had before, and I'm sure in watching this film there's some profound understanding of what humans are capable of given certain circumstances.  There is nothing sick about discovering such things, as long as one doesn't emulate them.  Too often people seem to confuse what happens on the screen with real life, and assume that anyone who watches violent films is bound for violence themselves.  I don't know how much violence on the screen motivates others' violence, but a movie like A Clockwork Orange does not glorify it.  As long as violence is depicted in a responsible way, I think it may even be beneficial for it to be viewed, lest we forget how rotten people can be.  Anyone who maintains that it is movies like this that lead to so much of the violence in our society needs to take a little look at history and stop pointing the fingers at people who've never committed a truly violent act in their lives but who happen to enjoy films that are violent.Okay, that got rather political.  But this movie does have political and sociological implications- that much was clear from my brief viewing of it. It is important to note that this movie was not meant as a blueprint of how to behave, and anyone who thinks it is has problems that are going to arise without the movie.  So for all those people who call fans of this movie depraved: why not focus your energy on something that really matters, like getting guns off the street or children out of abusive homes or abusive parents and spouses into counseling, and leave movie fans alone.",Null,0,0,18 July 1999
Eyes Wide Shut," Hit and miss
","This movie needed more editing.  I know they wanted to keep the film the way Kubrick made it, but it seems unlikely to me that he wasn't going to edit it anymore after other people actually saw it.  Some of the transitions between scenes are absolutely horrible, and there is a lot of wasted space, though that likely would've stayed in the film; Kubrick always liked to plod along.Which brings me to my second criticism of this film.  At times I found it, well, boring, which seems strange, since it was billed as some kind of sex-fest; instead, there isn't that much sex in it, although in my opinion, that is probably a better thing.  I also thought the scenes with LeeLee Sobieski were quite irrelevant.  At most, they were amusing but added nothing to the story at all.My fourth problem was those stupid added-in figures in the orgy scene.  It's not that I need to see what they're obscuring; the problem is that the figures were extremely distracting and really stood out. 
My fifth problem also relates to the orgy scene: why were most of the women so skinny? The piano player talks about how amazing the women are there, and then they turn out to be a bunch of sticks.  I'm sorry, but if I can see all the bones in someone's back, even those in the lower back, bulging out, that person is too thin.  And people wonder why women sometimes feel so much pressure to lose weight.  In the case of the thighless woman who warns Cruise, I suppose it makes some amount of sense, because she's supposed to be a drug addict.  The only thing I can figure out, other than perhaps the casting director having some serious issues relating to body image in other people, is that the sometimes twisted attendants at the orgy prefer for some reason women who are highly abnormal.My last problem was the sometimes gratuitous use of the word f*ck.  I realise that many people use that word frequently. My problem with it is that, at least among people I know, when you're talking about sex with your (potential) life partner, you don't usually use such a crude word to describe having sex with that person.  Yet it is used frequently in this movie in that context.  'F*ck' is a word that fits very well to Kidman's fantasy about the naval guy, but not to her having sex with Cruise.  I suppose this is just my opinion, but I did have a problem with that, although it didn't affect my view of this film much.What I DID like about this film was that the basic idea of the film should provoke discussion among couples.  In perhaps a strange phenomenon, Person A knows that he or she is attracted to people other than Person B, and may even have been seriously tempted to act on such feelings, but it doesn't occur to him or her that Person B is in exactly the same situation.  And sometimes it bothers Person A immensely, just like in this film.  I suppose this is because we all know what goes on in our own heads, but we have to guess at what goes on in other people's; we don't know just HOW tempted they were, or if they acted on the impulse and just aren't admitting it.  It seems to me that this is a subject matter that every couple needs to discuss, rather than assuming something and living in a fantasy world, until it all comes crashing down when the illusion is shattered (like in the film- all that stiff about women being 'different' than men).Warning: slight spoiler ahead.  Some people, including those I saw this movie with, seem to have missed the point of the HIV+ hooker.  My take on that was to show just what Cruise could have lost by acting on his jealous, untrusting, and perhaps vengeful impulses.  Instead, he got lucky- not in the way one usually would with a hooker, but because his wife called him on his cell right before he did the deed.  Would he have gone through with it had she not called? I would not have been sure he would, except that the next evening, he was already to get it on with hooker number 2, until she informed him of Domino's bad news.  This to me is another good point of discussion: should such things count as infidelity, when a person did not commit the deed but would have if he had not been interrupted (in the first case)? And in the case of Kidman's fantasy with the naval guy: should her insistence that, had the evening gone by a little differently, she would have had sex with him, be taken as an act of infidelity on her part,or should she be given the benefit of the doubt that she wouldn't have been able to go through with it? I think it is important for both parties in a relationship to know where the line gets drawn.I also thought that acting was, for the most part, good.  I did not find Kidman's laughing fit remotely unbelievably; it was perfectly consisted with my experience, however limited, with pot smokers. So basically, I thought this movie could have been substantially better (especially considering the number of retakes Kubrick insisted on), but it is still worth watching because it is thought provoking; it makes a person ponder both his or her own boundaries as well as those of his or her partner.",6,1,2,2 September 1999
Pulp Fiction," Decent, but what's all the fuss about?
","Most people I know who have seen this movie either think it's the best movie ever or the worst piece of trash ever produced.  I happen to fall in the middle.  I enjoyed this film, though not immensely.  I found it funny, which actually kind of disturbs me in a way.  Should it be funny when someone accidentally gets blown away? Yet I found it to be.  Still, I think the extreme amount of violence got to me, since it mostly did not have much of a point; it is really only the one scene of violence that I thought was amusing.  I thought the Bruce Willis storyline could have been done without, instead focusing on Travolta and Jackson.  Instead, the 'story' meanders and seems largely without purpose.  Despite that, though, it was still an enjoyable film.  I recommend it as long as people realise what they're in for, and don't just watch it because of the hype surrounding it; when someone expects perfection and they don't get it, they tend to over-compensate and react more negatively than they otherwise would have, and end up giving this film a 1 instead of the 5 they might have given it had they not been shocked by the content.I give this film a 6.5, mainly for the dark humor.  This movie is not for everyone.  Don't watch this movie with blinders on, and hopefully it will be worth the 2 hours and (possibly) the $3-4 you spent to rent it (although in Canada, I know you can watch an unedited version of it on Showcase- that channel is great for films they can't show on the networks without such severe editing that part of the story is lost).  The other thing I liked about this movie was the characters themselves; Tarantino is very good at taking what would from the outside seem like despicable, inhumane creatures and making them human.  While I don't know how many hitmen are actually nice guys, it is nice to see films sometimes that have normal people doing bad things, instead of just evil, rotten, flat characters.  This film is thus a good character study, for those interested in the workings of the human mind.",6,4,10,13 August 1999
