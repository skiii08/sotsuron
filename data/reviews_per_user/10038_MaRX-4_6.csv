The Blair Witch Project," Depressingly DISAPPOINTING.
","Definitely over-hyped and disappointing. The film which was set to scare the hell out of everyone, failed to even earn a flinch, let alone a closing of the eyes. . .The light glimmer of fear it did manage to winkle out of me came from my fear of what I THOUGHT might happen. Which always ended up NOT happening.The hand-held filming and 'realistic' style of it also proved to be not as effective as I'd thought it might be.I also dare to say, at times it tetered on the edge of being boring.
As I said, DEPRESSINGLY DISAPPOINTING.",Null,0,1,8 December 1999
Se7en," Become WRATH. . .
","Se7en left me hollow.Se7en enlightened me.Se7en opened my eyes.Se7en will TEACH you.'. . .because, we see a deadly sin, on every corner, in every home, and we tolerate it, because it's common, because it's trivial. We tolerate it morning noon and night. Well, not any more. I'm setting the example. And what I've done, is going to be puzzled over, and remembered forever, and FOLLOWED. . .'-John DoeThese words not only sent a chill down my spine, but also opened my eyes to the sins of the world we live in.ABSOLUTELY TERRIFYING.Philosophical to the root.People who haven't seen this film, I admire you.I mean it, I ADMIRE YOU.I ENVY YOU.I guess ENVY is MY sin. . .",8,0,0,29 January 1999
Forrest Gump," LOVED, or HATED.
","Well, this is a film, which sees, to be either LOVED or HATED.To me, this film appealed to me for it's story-line, and the way it is 'different' from other films. I also liked the fact that a lot 'happened' in the film.The idea of the film separates it from any other. From childhood bullies to  The Vietnam War, this film is a real pleaser.At times sad, funny, confusing, this trip through Forrest Gump's life is a heart warming experience.Absolutely, 'Vundabar'!",8,0,2,30 January 1999
American Pie," Seriously, THIS IS ONE OF THE WORST.
","This would have to be one of THE worst films ever. Yep, it's down there with Saving Private Ryan.Although amusing AT TIMES, at others, this really has you staring at the ceiling. I would go as far as to say that Stalin's 1950's propaganda films would be more enthralling than American Pie.Definietly one for teenage girls.2/10.",Null,0,1,25 September 1999
Saving Private Ryan," BORING. That is all.
","Unbelievably hyped-up, this pathetic attempt to make THE (unbias) War Movie, in my opinion, FAILED.Steven SPEILBERG: Mission FAILED.After 2 hours of irrelevant, continous, meaningless fighting, bloodshed and gore, one finds Saving Private Ryan BORING. The first scene of battle is effective, but when this is followed by another 2 hours of similar material, well, you're not left with much.With the first and last scene being an American Flag waving in the wind, one realises that indeed, 'this is another load of American patriotic RUBBISH'.Lacking a story-line, this is a hollow tree.2/10 for Saving Private Ryan.",1,8,17,21 January 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," FORREST GUMP AIN'T THAT BAD. . .
","Well, everyone seems to mention Forrest Gump in their bit about Shawshank.So, maybe I will, too.As a Terminator 2 fan, I feel naturally fascinated by The Shawshank Redemption. This film pushes all the buttons of a person with a caring heart.With a brilliant cast, story line, director and set, this is a master piece rivaled only by T2, Titanic, The Rock, and perhaps Dances with Wolves.A 8.5/10 from MaRX.",10,1,1,22 January 1999
