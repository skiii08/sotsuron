Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Entertaining if Untraditional take on Sherlock Holmes
","I loved it. This is definitely a guy flick but not completely so. The explosions, the stop action sequences, the special effects, the gadgetry and the alternative reality sequences owe something to the CSI Las Vegas and to that wonderful old TV program 'Wild Wild West' where the Robert Conrad and his sidekick Artemis Gordon traveled in Victorian elegance in a private train car and dealt with evil genius strangely similar to Dr. Moriarty, if only in an old West context.While it is not in keeping with the Holmes and Watson created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the wonder of the characters is that they are larger than any one writer's conception. Doyle himself grew tired of Sherlock Holmes and did his best ultimately to kill him off, but such characters have steadfastly refused to die. It is fitting therefore that generations of writers have seen fit to provide their take of the classic Holmes and Watson.The movie is a joy to watch, the period costumes, the lush photography, the locations, the historical context and the extremely complex tapestry of narrative in all of its confusion of pieces which in the end do well fitting together in the final scenes. The manic genius of the Downey Holmes meshes well with the somewhat more normal Watson, and the touches of humor are just right.",9,1,2,9 January 2012
The Machinist," An effective psychological thriller
","The Machinist stars Christian Bale in one of the weirdest and creepiest movies I think I have ever seen. Cue the theremin. It makes Hitchcock's Psycho look tame by comparison. Bale plays Trevor Reznik, who works in a gloomy machine shop from hell, one that apparently never heard of OSHA. The whole thing is filmed in a kind of high contrast off color monochrome. His whole life seems to revolve around visiting his prostitute/girlfriend and the girl whom he has come to know serving him at the Airport coffee shop. The guy is haunted and paranoid. He keeps getting post it notes in the form of a game of hangman on his refrigerator which creep him out. He also pursues a strange bullet-headed fellow with some fingers missing, who drives a red convertible and seems always there with a cheerful demeanor whenever something horrible happens, such as when a machine malfunctions and his co-worker loses an arm. Only Trevor seems to see him and is clearly going from bad to worse. Trevor claims to not have been able to sleep in a year. His weight is plummeting and he looks like a concentration camp survivor. The mystery to be solved is why all this is happening.All in all, I thought it was an effective psychological thriller in the spirit of Alfred Hitchcock at his creepiest.",8,1,1,21 November 2015
28 Days Later...," Yet another Killer Virus
","There are some themes, like the end of the world, that works of the imagination keep returning to over and over again. Rod Taylor in the 1959 classic film 'The Time Machine' sees the human race destroying itself in a nuclear war only to reemerge with subterranean carnivorous morlocks farming a race of dumb blondes as a source of food while they greenly lurk underground. Charlton Heston in 'The Omega Man' hides out in a heavily fortified compound, cruising the empty streets of the heavily fortified city while crazed, light-averse survivors of a plague wait until dark to pounce and destroy. Stephen King's film adaptation of his book 'The Stand' shows us a world decimated by a killer influenza which has the survivors ending up in Las Vegas. And Michael Crichton has the demon agent coming from outer space in 'The Andromeda Strain' and doing bad things to rubber and turning human blood to red dust. And now once again in the UK this time, '28 Days After' those generally untrustworthy scientists in secret labs are playing deadly games with germ warfare agents only to be unwittingly set free by animal rights guerillas. Having seen so many of these films before, I think '28 Days Later' does an excellent job of conveying the weird and horrible world of survivors of a holocaust.As a microbiologist I am in a somewhat better than average position to judge the scientific merits of such events. Certainly viruses and plagues have decimated populations in the past, from the Black Plagues of the middle ages, to the 1918 influenza pandemic, and the AIDS pandemic of today. The Ebola outbreaks of central Africa are perhaps the most mysterious and horrifying in recent memory, and in this era of worldwide air travel or of natural migrations of infected birds, it isn't far from reality. It is a good thing that public health officials maintain a certain vigilance.What sets '28 Days Later' apart is its 'realism' (while of course being quite a work of imagination) however the virus is not the only heavy of the piece. While I could have told them not to take the tunnel, and would have probably put the car in reverse at the sight of all the wrecked cars underneath, and tried a bridge, and while I wonder at the tendency of contagion to turn normal people into murdering zombies who like rabid dogs attack and infect others, the curious turns of the plot where the characters make their way through a post-apocalyptic world where not all the villains are 'the infecteds' made it a truly effective film in the horror genre. It was an excellent film.",9,2,3,5 October 2008
Blade Runner," A classic in the Sci Fi genre
","This movie is great on so many levels. In terms of an urban dystopia it reminds me a lot of Terry Gilliam's 'Brazil' (Or should I say it foreshadowed 'Brazil' since it was made three years earlier). It is one of the rare films that does not paint all in black and white, and in the end you feel mixed emotions, sorry for the replicants and realize perhaps the villain of the piece was actually Dr. Tyrrel playing God with increasingly human-like androids which, like beautiful but flawed automobiles, are cursed with 'planned obsolescence.' And who hasn't been in an interview situation like that with which the film opens where some slick, supercilious HR type is trying to pigeonhole you with a few questions? I couldn't help but cheer for Leon as he blows him away. The Tyrrel corporation is evil, as the way they are playing God with the replicants makes clear.The other, less prosperous techno-nerds of the piece come off somewhat better. The Chinese eye designer in the cold room, and J.F. Sebastian, the ultimate nerd, who lives alone with his 'toys' in a crumbling run down apartment building called 'The Bradbury' in a tip of the hat to another great science Fiction writer. (I guess you couldn't have called the apartment building 'The Dick' after Phillip K. Dick, the writer from whose novel this film was drawn.) Sebastian (William Sanderson) is a prematurely old genetic engineer who has created his own phantasmagorical world in his large flat. Like his creations the replicants, he has a limited life span, only in his case it is a medical condition and not as withthe Nexus 6 model replicants caused by a pre-determined limitation on their life span.In the middle of this is the title character, the Blade Runner, otherwise known as Deckard (Harrison Ford) and Gaff (Edward James Olmos) who keeps Deckard from wandering off in disgust, and who has a strange habit of leaving samples of origami wherever he goes. The Blade Runner falls in love with a beautiful replicant (Sean Young) who doesn't even know she is a replicant, at first. Deckard dutifully goes about his business, tracking down and 'retiring' the outlaw replicants, but clearly seems in the end caught in the middle of a moral dilemma.In the end the story is a parable of the sadness and shortness of life, which for those of us in middle life becomes ever more poignant. It seems clear we are all programmed to die by our maker.",10,0,2,10 November 2009
