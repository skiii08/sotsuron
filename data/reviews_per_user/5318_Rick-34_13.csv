Kill Bill: Vol. 2," completion of Vol 1 is worth it
","I felt compelled to write something, as the comment on the main page at this moment is a negative review.  Now, I can understand negative reviews, but this reviewer preferred Vol. 1, and that's not a viewpoint I can understand.In contrast to Vol. 1, Vol. 2 has a better storyline.  The characters are fleshed out a lot more, and the plot starts to make sense.  Important details missing from Vol. 1 appear and tie the entire story together. Whereas Vol. 1 got bogged down a bit in overlong sequences regarding O-Ren Ishii, the pacing in Vol. 2 is much better.  Uma Thurman is really on the top of her game in the Kill Bill series.  She projects strength and intelligence that is often missing in female leads (I'm thinking, for example, of Kidman in Cold Mountain).  Michael Madsen, David Carradine, and Gordon Liu are terrific, and Darryl Hannah is simply dastardly.   Samuel L. Jackson has a cameo that is very difficult to spot! The action and dialogue are both terrific, as we've come to expect from a Tarantino movie.  A mixture of cinematographic techniques keeps the viewer on edge, and the background music harkens back to the tradition of melodramatic '70s TV (esp. the 'Ironsides' music).  On the whole, a very enjoyable film.",Null,0,1,18 April 2004
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Jennifer Lawrence makes this work
","When the producers decided to break Mockingjay into two films, we were pretty much fixed on a course where Part One was going to be anti-climactic compared to the rest of the series. So, no, it's not quite as good as Catching Fire (and thus, nowhere near the level of The Hunger Games). But still, this edition does a good job expanding the Penam universe, and developing the story of our heroine Katniss.Katniss works so well because she's authentic, free of the practiced cynicism that permeates President Snow and even the leaders of the rebellion. A key moment is when Haymitch Abernathy explains this fact to them. And it's really hard to imagine any young actress pulling this off as well as Jennifer Lawrence, who exudes authenticity herself. So Mockingjay has the emotional pull, it has a solid story line, it has a well-constructed dystopian world, and it has a solid cast with an exceptionally talented lead. It lacks only a satisfying conclusion, but as Part One, that can hardly be a surprise.",8,17,49,20 November 2014
Erin Brockovich," Same old triumph over the big, evil corporations
","This movie was ok, but certainly didn't break any new ground. Except, perhaps, in the whole relationship between Erin and her boyfriend, in which he's the one taking care of the kids all the time.I imagine that very quickly this movie will become known only for Julia Roberts' cleavage.  It could be close to being a good movie, but the Erin character is a little too perfect, too cliched in her 'I'm the poor, uneducated woman trying to take care of three kids and fight the evil power company.' A little more subtlety would be in order.",6,0,2,29 March 2000
World War Z," Decent addition to the genre - go in without expectations
","World War Z is an exciting zombie film that, while it doesn't break new ground in the genre like 28 Days Later, still fares well in terms of entertaining the audience with action sequences and smooth zombie movement. The acting, however, is what makes the film. Brad Pitt gives an understated performance and the supporting cast is excellent, especially Mireille Enos as his wife and Daniella Kertesz as an Israeli soldier. I've read a good number of reviews from people who read the book and found the film disappointing. I have not read the book and did not have expectations as high as that - perhaps that is why I wasn't disappointed. Yes, there were a few weak points in the plot, but on the other hand I found action sequences very well put together, and given the logic of what the Pitt character was thinking, I found the scenes in Wales well designed and quite exciting.So, no, it wasn't up to the level of 28 Days Later, but I thought it was at least as good as 28 Weeks Later, a film that lost its way halfway through.",7,0,3,13 July 2013
American Beauty," is it really that great to work in a burger joint?
","#2 movie of all-time on this database?  That's a bit hard to swallow.Yes, this movie is quite good.  But it is also quite flawed. The central message of this movie seems to be that one need not be afraid of anything.  There's also some overtones to suggest that irresponsibility can be more than an amusing tangential for a middle-aged man, but that it can be a reasonable goal for this person.  Lester is portrayed as a hero for blackmailing his boss, threatening his wife, ignoring his daughter, smoking dope, and generally fighting back against his feelings of powerlessness.  Yes, it's great to fight back against a feeling of powerlessness, but Lester's solution rings false.  The answer to the problems of adult life is not to behave like a 16-year old, up to and including the job at the local burger joint.The movie could have been interesting had Lester been forced to get his way out of the messes he was developing.  But instead, he's just killed off.  (This is no spoiler, you learn this in the first minute of the film.)This might sound moralistic, but that's not really my intention. Lester has problems and he's not dealing with them at all. He's regressing.  The really interesting movie would be how he adjusted himself to fit back into society.",8,0,0,25 March 2000
Caddyshack," yes a classic
","Caddyshack is (a) the funniest sports comedy ever, and (b) possibly the funniest movie of the 80s.  Perhaps one had to be a teenager in the 80s to really appreciate the brilliance of this movie.  But I can recall no other movie that had four comedians at the top of their games - Dangerfield, Murray, Chase, and Knight all are excellent.  And none of them is the 'lead character'! 
The classic moments of this movie include Carl Spackler recounting his trip to Tibet caddying for the Dalai Lama ('Gunga galunga, no.., gunga gunga lagunga'), the 'Cinderella story', the caddies shouting 'miss it Noonan, miss it', the 'doodie', the Havercamps, the betting on whether 'the Smails kid picks his nose', Ty Webb's golf lessons for Danny Noonan, and the many confrontations between Al Czervik and Judge Smails...the list goes on and on.Definitely a movie that stands the test of time.  Every five minutes, another hilarious scenes unfolds!",9,1,2,21 August 2003
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Kaufman keeps up the excellent work
","*spoilers? I don't think so*'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind' is an excellent consideration of the implications of memory loss.  Or rather, memory erasure.  I imagine most readers know the basic plot elements by now: Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet play a pair of lovers who have decided that their relationship has gotten so awful that it would be better to not be able to remember it at all.  Or, to be more accurate, she wipes him from her memory after a vicious comment he makes in an argument, and, despondent, he follows suit.The main part of the movie consists of Carrey's character Joel Barrish in a pseudo-dream sequence as the technicians from the memory erasure clinic slowly remove his important memories involving his girlfriend Clementine (Winslet), one by one.  The nonchalance of the technicians, played by Mark Ruffalo and Elijah Wood, contrasts strongly with Joel's increasing despondence, as he realizes to his horror that he wishes to hold onto his memories, as the good memories reflect the best times of his otherwise miserable life.These sequences hit deep emotional chords.  One of the nice things about Charlie Kaufman films (I'm thinking of this film, 'Being John Malkovich', and 'Adaptation'), is that his characters are not brimming with glamour as happens so often in Hollywood.  Cusack is pathetic in 'Malkovich', Cage is lumpy and detached in 'Adaptation', and in this film, Carrey is a bit grimy, while Winslet is deeply flighty.  The supporting cast is also excellent; in addition to Ruffalo and Wood, Tom Wilkinson and Kirsten Dunst do excellent jobs as the memory removal doctor and his receptionist, respectively. 
This movie is science fiction at its best.  Science fiction, when the genre started, was not so much about flying through space and killing aliens, but rather about working with a simple concept, in this case memory erasure, and tugging on that thread, so to speak, to see how such a possibility would change our lives.  While other films in recent years, most notably Memento and Vanilla Sky, have tackled this subject, none have done it with the appreciation of grubby humanity that Kaufman brings to the topic.Some reviewers have complained that the movie was confusing in direction, and weighed down by Kaufman's eccentricities.  I could not disagree more! For me, the eccentricities are essential!",9,0,1,6 April 2004
The Artist," Well, the dog was pretty good
","There are a lot of good things about this film. The acting is good, and the cinematography is good. And the dog is terrific. But something is missing: an interesting story. I saw this film in a theater with less than 30 people watching. It's not making a lot of money. People are not very interested because there's very little to relate to here. The story is about a silent film star who refuses to make 'talkies' and whose career hits the skids as a result. Um, duh? Get a job? Make an adjustment? Apparently the worst possible fate in the world is to not be able to work as a movie star. It's a shame because the main characters are likable. But there's almost no story here. The story that they do have is ridden with mawkish over- simplicity.",6,1,6,28 January 2012
Inside Man," some clever idea and great cast
","It's curious to see Spike Lee do a straight caper movie. The movie is absent Lee's usual politics, though there are occasional glimpses of his sensibilities. At one point a Sikh has his turban taken away and complains at ends how Sikhs are not Arabs and he's tired of getting harassed all the time.Anyway, the cast is great - Denzel Washington, Clive Owen, Jodie Foster, and Christopher Plummer are all top-drawer actors. Willem Dafoe has a smaller part that doesn't use all of his talents, unfortunately. The clever twist the plot adds is that the bank robbers dress everybody up in the same masks and jump suits that they themselves are wearing. So if the police raid the bank, they'll have a difficult time figuring who the bad guys are. (This isn't a spoiler - it's in the trailers.) Clive Owen and the robbers are clearly up to something that becomes apparent during the course of the film. They are particularly interested in the safety deposit box of the bank CEO, played by Christopher Plummer. Jodie Foster is brought in by him to protect 'his interests'. Her existence is amusing in that it reveals a bit about what Spike Lee thinks the corridors of white power are like. (Here's a hint, Spike: rich white folks don't swear at each other quite as much as you make them do, and in particular the word used by the Mayor to describe Jodie Foster's character is way beyond the pale. A real woman with as much influence as her character had would retaliate massively after being so described. But Spike Lee has never quite managed to capture any female character correctly, dating all the way back to Nola Darling. I digress.) The good parts of the film involve the interactions between Washington and Owen. Also, the many small man-on-the-street conversations are great. This aspect of observing street life has always been one of Lee's strongest points.It was interesting watching a Spike Lee caper film. I kinda like the idea. It's better than the formulaic caper films that are the rage, and features some of Lee's trademark shots, like when he puts an actor on a dolly to create non-walking walking movement. I recommend the film.",8,133,205,19 March 2006
The Matrix Reloaded," Not bad - for a sequel
","OK, first things first.  People don't go to see a Matrix movie expecting high art.  They expect to see action:  chases, fights, explosions, etc.  To that extent, Matrix II delivers.  But there is more here to think about. 
The Matrix movies are presenting the philosophical conundrum:  what if everything we think we see is not actually 'real'?  In Matrix I, we are exposed to the idea that the mundane daily experience is actually a shared illusion created by machines who are using the biochemical energy of humans, and keeping their minds busy while doing so.  This sci-fi explanation seemed laughable at the time (surely there must be a better way to generate energy), but Matrix II starts to go in a new direction that makes the first explanation more palatable, though it itself leaves one waiting for the third film.  The barriers between the Matrix and the 'real world' start to collapse in Matrix II - and the implications are quite interesting to consider.The acting in Matrix II is solid.  Fishburne is dominating as Morpheus, Reeves is at his best with the kind of understated character he has here, and Carrie-Anne Moss is quite good, also.  Hugo Weaving is starting to grow on me as Agent Smith, who in this version has broken free of the Matrix structure and has become an independent agent, so to speak. 
For a long section of the movie, our heroes are on a quest to track down the 'Keymaker'.  It is very hard not to think of Rick Moranis barking like a dog in Central Park when this happens!  The action sequences in the middle of the film are the best, with notable performances by a pair of albino dreadlocked matrix wraiths. Finally, one point I liked, and which I'm stunned to find criticized by another reviewer, is that a relatively large proportion of the main characters are black.  This is somehow offensive?  I found it noteworthy, and I liked it.  Why must we always assume that sci-fi populations demographically resemble a Connecticut suburb?  The great thing about the racial melange in Matrix II is that it is not mentioned at all.  They are not trumpeting 'hey, look at us, we're mutli-cultural!'  They seem to not care about race at all.  Isn't this a good thing?",7,0,0,19 May 2003
Iron Man," excellent adaptation of a comic
","Really, the best adaptation of a comic I've seen in years - much, much better than Ang Lee's Hulk, Batman Begins, or Superman Returns. I'd even say it's a bit better than the Spiderman series.The plot contains most of the necessary elements for the first story of any superhero. There is an origin story, how Iron Man is created, as well as the motivation for the main character, and the eventual discovery of worthy villains.What separates Iron Man are a few things. The script is excellent, the effects are excellent, the technology is at least mildly plausible (to the point the suspension of disbelief isn't absurd, as with Superman), the plot involves contemporary elements (terrorism, arms merchants), and most importantly, the acting is superb.Robert Downey Jr. is superbly cast as Tony Stark. I cannot imagine anybody else playing this role. But the supporting cast is good, esp. Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, the latter of whom is hardly recognizable as Stark's longtime partner.Some advice for anybody seeing this film: stay through the entirety of the credits.",9,1,3,1 May 2008
Mother!," Disappointed...in reviewers
","I swear, 90% of the people writing negative reviews seem to have made no effort to understand that the entire film is metaphorical. Also, as metaphors work, a film like this isn't designed to have simple explanations.The movie is about humanity's abuse of Mother Earth. But it also works at the level presented, where it's about a wife who suffers emotional cruelty at the hands of her emotionally unengaged husband. To a great extent the film is a commentary on the emotional abuse of women. And yes, it goes straight into fantasy from the start.Viewers who only like realistic films should not see Mother! They will hate it. Having said that, Mother! is not like Rosemary's Baby. That comparison misses the point completely.Also, Rex Reed is a doofus.",8,3,10,23 September 2017
Cube," pretentious pseudo-intellectual existentialism
","The worst thing about this movie was that I had a good idea of exactly where it was going after the first five minutes. OK, the premise is not terrible, but nor is it very original. You've got a bunch of people trapped in some kind of three-dimensional mazea - they don't know why they are there or whether they can get out.  Shades of the legendary 'Prisoner' TV program, or 'No Exit' by Sartre.  Typical existentialist themes: why are we here, what can we do, how do we solve our problems, is there any reason to have hope?The themes are reasonable, but the execution is terrible.  What one expects is a thematic pursuit about what people want to live for, some psychological exploration, etc.  What we get is inconsistent character development and insulting plot twists.My main problem with this movie is that the Worth and Quentin characters are very inconsistently drawn.  In the first half of the movie, the Quentin character provides leadership qualities, getting people motivated and moving, keeping up hope, while the Worth character is moody and generally acts like a coward and an ass. Suddenly, in the middle of the movie, each undergoes a magical transformation.  Worth is now the moral force behind the group, while Quentin becomes violent and rageful, ultimately reaching a state where he is a typical movie bad guy.  His psychosis appears suddenly without rhyme or reason.  Any hope I had for this movie went out the window when it appeared.  The movie was no longer even a half-decent treatment of existentialist themes, but rather had degenerated into 'watch out for the bad guy' stuff.  Very disappointing.One minor quibble: the Leaven character is somehow easily able to tell if a three-digit number is prime or not, but then is paralyzed if she has to decide whether a number is a prime power.  As a professional mathematician, I have to say this plot twist is laughable.  Factoring three-digit numbers is a simple trick for a mathematician of Leaven's supposed caliber. The number of prime powers less than 1000 which are not themselves prime is really quite small.  One doesn't need a Rainman-type savant to solve this problem.  (Had they been factoring the full 9-digit numbers, well, that would have been much more impressive.)  Ultimately, I was disappointed as the theme and the setting lent themselves to a very interesting movie.  But it just didn't happen.  Too bad.",6,0,1,28 July 2000
