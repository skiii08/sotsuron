Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Maybe it's just me, but this movie stunk
","If being a great technical achievement is basis for being a great movie, then let's give out 10's to all those 3-D flicks from the Fifties and Sixties. Don't want to do that? Then, let's judge it as a movie. OK, I just did, and it gets a 1 out of 10.Maybe it's just me... But, I found NO appeal in Roger himself. None. In fact, I hated him. Annoying voice, annoying personality, NEVER a funny line, movement, or gesture. Well, if he was not funny, then he was likable? No. Not funny plus annoying is not a good start in a title character. And, Jessica Rabbit, how did Roger ever marry her. Why would he want to, no personality, flirt, just a sleazy trouble magnet. Further, why would she want to marry him?. A nerdy, screw-up. And, why was she drawn with such dripping sexuality? I was torn between hoping her gown would slip off, and wondering why I was thinking such thoughts about a cartoon. Weird. Sick. Yuck. Hoskins did a yeoman's job, but most of his accomplishment was acting to the animated characters. As a character in a drama, I thought he came off a little flat.  His character was ultimately very predictable.
You know, I don't even remember Christopher Lloyd... I guess he was an over-the-top bad guy. Shocker. Now, there is something every great movie should have:  A cardboard bad guy, and an very unfunny cartoon as the good guy. NOT.   Now, the ratio between 1 and 10 ratings  (a stat I check all the time) was almost 10:1. So maybe it was just me... If you rent it, make sure you have someone to talk to, because you won't want to waste time following the story.  Just talk over it.",1,28,75,27 March 2003
The Piano," Long, dry, and dry.
","How long was this movie? 4 hours. No, it seemed like it was longer.  All the characters were very hard to like. Plot sorta of hard to relate to. 2 strikes and you are out for me. I am sure the filmwork was good, I forced it out of my mindWhy did people like it, cause they were supposed to? I don't know. Oscar for the girl? Must have been a thin crop of competitors.  Watch this movie at home with a glass of wine so you feel arty and sophisticated.  But be sure you have a magazine in your lap so the whole evening isn't wasted. Long, dry, and long. And dry.",2,6,12,2 August 2002
A Night at the Roxbury," Sorry. Not funny.
","The ratings don't lie.  This movie is not funny.  4.8 is a gift; I gave it a 1. It is one of the worst I have ever seen.  Any movie where the leading characters are really, really stupid starts off with one foot in the grave. Bad gags and lousy writing will push where it belongs, 6 feet under.  The music is decent and the memories, well you are supplying them, cause this isn't evoking them.  This is the punch line here: any movie with really dumb characters has to make you like them, or it has to make you bust out laughing, otherwise you will quickly despise the characters. These two brothers here are not likable, where is the sympathy in two clueless oafs? How can we play along if the jokes are bad?Dumb and Dumber I almost liked--same scenario: 2 really dumb guys.  But the jokes were funny and the guys almost sympathetic. I hated Something About Mary for this same reason as this movie: no one to like; many to despise. If you liked that movie (for some reason) then take that into consideration. But I recommend you keep the 99 cents in your pocket and rent Princess Bride or something.",2,1,7,10 May 2002
