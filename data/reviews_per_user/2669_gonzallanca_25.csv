Blade Runner 2049," Disappointing
","Blade Runner: 2049The sequel to one of the most inspiring films of the science fiction genre, with one of the best directors that currently has the cinema, makes this film in one of the most anticipated of the year.After 30 years, Deckard (Harrison Ford), we begin with the story of a young Blade Runner, called 'K'. You will have to investigate a story very mysterious, that will be intertwined with their past, too.Let's start with the actors. Ryan Gosling, as 'K', is the best part of the movie. Sademos that Gosling is one of the best actors of the film, currently. Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, also is the best part of the movie. It is a pleasure to see a character after 35 years. And for me, those were the most important actors of the film. The truth is that none surpasses the other. The two are very uneven.'Nostalgia, a feeling of pity for the remoteness, the absence, the deprivation or loss of someone or something dear.' In this film they exploit this. But not exploit it for evil, exploit it for good. The photography and cinematography is very close to its predecessor. And that is something that I liked a lot.The film does not abuse of special effects, like its predecessor. The truth that it does not bother me. The truth is that I quite like.Here we start with the bad. The duration of the movie. The movie lasts 2:43 minutes, easily last 2:00. I do not know if this is a SPOILER but I warn you. The film is passed 2 hours in a character in the film that to us does not interest us both. We want to see Deckard not to 'K'. If they had done a Spinn-Off. And the film feels a bit boring without Deckard.Dennis Villanue is one of the best current directors, I said it before... But the film makes it very long. Unreasonably long. Although the feeling of nostalgia that puts you, it works very well for the film.8/10 Disepcionante. Expected much more from this director.",7,1,7,7 October 2017
Train to Busan," Very Cool
","Opinion about Train to Busan (2016) Train to Busan is a film of the year 2016. Directed by Sang-ho Yeon. Seok-woo (Yoo Gong) an entrepreneur goes on a train to base to see the mother of his daughter (Soo-an). But u zombie apocalypse to prevent them. Passing along with other people must survive on the train. What will? The movie in general I liked a lot. I was as usual with the theme of the zombies. But throughout the film increases the fear of the zombies. The movements of the zombies i found it very good, such as robotic to be transformed.Another important point of the film is the closeness that one has with the main characters, a don't know not how is called but just as you want it. And that is difficult to do. That closeness to the characters are shown in a trilogy, but here we only have one movie to love them.The deaths in the film seem to me to be sooooooooo unexpected, which gives a touch of surprise. Not as The Walking Dead, you say 'Not that cannot die because it is the protagonist' here that doesn't happen. Anyone can die.What I liked the most of the film is the pace you take. From start to finish. Sitting quietly on the train, to be fighting against zombies. You should not take your eyes to the screen, because you will miss out on something incredible.What I found stupid in the movie, is that if the zombies don't see you don't eat. I found it ridiculous. But it gives a new twist to the movie, something more radical.I liked a lot 8/10",8,1,2,2 May 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," Good
","Rogue One: A Star Wars Story He introduces us to Yyn Erso, a fugitive from the empire. That after being trapped in a prison of the Empire, is rescued by the rebels with a mission for her, steal the planes of the death star.First the actors. Felicity Jones in her role as Jyn Erso does it well, not for an Oscar nomination, but does well. Diego Luna also liked me, on the same level as Felicity. And the one that surprised me was Donnie Yen who enchanted me his role in this film, as an attractive to the force but without saber laser.The effects of this movie are incredible. As they show the Death Star is imposing. From the trailers we predicted that Darth Vader would appear, but the way he did it in Rogue One is epic with the voice of James Earl Jones. Well deserved the Oscar nomination.Great 9/10",8,2,4,20 February 2017
Thor: Ragnarok," Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3
","Thor: RagnarokThor (Chris Hemsworth) had dreams of the destruction of their beloved people, Asgard, by an abominable monster called Surtur. For this reason, Thor and the 'ReAvengers', they will have to stop to Surtur to destroy Asgard.Let's start with the actors. Chris Hemsworth as Thor does not show much change, not saying that it is bad acting makes it very well, but does not exceed inside the cast. On the other hand, Tom Hiddleston as Loki, we are amazed each time that appeared in a film of Marvel, and this is no exception. Tessa Thompson, as Valkyrie, didn't have much hope in the film, but really surprised me. And the actor/actress that surpasses the cast is Cate Blanchett, playing Hella the Goddess of Death. I thought it was a very interesting character, costume design, their way of fighting, and, above all, how good it looks Cate Blanchett in the suit, are the best of the film.I thought it was very good the work of Taika Waititi, director of the film, photographically speaking.The film focuses more comedy than the revelation of Asgars. I think it was a very risky, but well taken. Because it clearly did not fare well in previous deliveries, making the story more dark (Thor: The Dark World). But, many times in the movie comedy, jokes, etc, to outweigh the same story. Changing the story to a background.The truth is that the colors, both in the poster as in the movie, not bothered me. On the contrary, I liked it. I found that what made marvel with this film, in addition to prepare couple Infinity War, is to do something different to what they did the previous films. That's why I liked it so much this movie.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 9/10",8,11,19,6 November 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Very Very Funny
","Spider-man Man: Homecoming or Spider-man: back to home.Peter Parker (Tom Holland) after being called by Tony Stark to his side in Captain America: Civil War, must deal life in high school and in his own house, and at the same time become little by little in an avenger.Let's start with the actors. Tom Holland as Peter Parker/Spider-Man is a great success for the film. Holland has the character, personality, age, (not like the others...), and when I discovered that Holland was groin, causing it to explode, I did not expect it, his accent is almost perfect. Michael Keaton (Batman) as Adrian Tooms or the Vulture, is the best part of the movie. Before the premiere we had all the hope in this villain, and exceeded expectations. It is a great character, their reasons are comprendibles, until some (the audience) are characterized with the character. And the truth is that Zendaya was OK, not outstanding, but well, like Jacob Whole Battalion as Ned, very funny. And Aunt May that is one of my favorite parts of the movie, with all that is sexy on the streets, in the restaurant, until they tell Peter in the school. I liked the character of Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man (obviously)Thanks Sony for giving the rights, if not we would not have this movie. The sub machine gun of jokes, jokes, references in the film is impeccable, i think i saw 1 or 2 jokes out of place, but all (which were many) were very gracious and place each one of them. Marvel knows how to move these characters (for example Spider-Man) not as Sony does not know how to exploit to the maximum (The Amazing Spider-Man: The threat of electro)Very funny 9/10",8,0,4,14 July 2017
Alien," A Classic
","Alien: The eighth passenger.It tells the story of 7 passengers in the ship nostromo going direct to earth after a mission. But when the ship receives a signal of life on a planet debited, the ship wakes his passengers to go to investigate. But when one of the passengers is infected by a weirdo. They will not know what it is.Let's start with the actors... or only with Segourney Weaver. It is a great actress who feels his fear... to be alone... and the Alien... That. The other actors is not that I don't import is that nothing in the film as well that would equal to each one. This is called the fill, baby.This film for MUUUUCHOOOOOS is cultured. For me it is.The effects in this film are very good. Not as much as Star Wars: A New Hope. And in addition the direction of Ridley Scoot is very good is very good. Those scenes when Ripley escapes of alien, the camera will not look at the Alien if not that Ripley running. The art of the film is also very good. How is made the Alien or the egg of the alien, the scenarios.Then let us hope Alien: Covenant to see how it is.8/10",8,1,2,25 May 2017
Baby Driver," Dynamic
","Baby Driver or Baby: The Apprentice of the Crime A talented driver, Baby (Ansel Elgort), a criminal gang, headed by Doc (Kevin Spacey), want to get out of this criminal life to have a normal life with Deborah (Lily James). Let's start with the actors. Ansel Elgort falls like ring to the finger to this movie, I couldn't imagine anyone else doing this role. As with Kevin Spacey, because the character she plays... is Kevin Spacey. Is the interpreting itself. Is this wrong? No... is the best part of the movie. Like Jon Hamm, the best of the film. The film is super hyper dynamic, you cannot close the eyes at any moment in the film. Or if you do not have to re-read it. A great direction, under the command of Edgar Wright, which forces you to look at all the time the screen. The action is dynamic with a very moving story, and funny sometimes. What makes a movie many enjoyable. The music in impeccable. Impeccable With the protagonist. With the action. But in some moments of the movie I drowned the music. But I think that was the idea. But to me it bothered me. If you are going to see a movie that I have a very deep meaning in a movie, this is not such a film. With this comes to see how to kill Kevin Spacey a bunch of times, not to win the Oscar for best film. Dynamic 9/10",9,2,7,19 August 2017
Collateral," Sorprising
","CollateralAt the wrong time and in the wrong place, Max the taxi driver (Jamie Fox), has as crew to Vincent (Tom Cruise), who until Now he seemed to be a common passenger. But Max discovers that Is a hit man. This is how Max will have to escape from Vincent.Let's start with the actors. Jamie Fix was nominated for an Oscar for this paper. The truth is that at first I saw him as the character type Silly and pathetic, as we see in The Amazing Spiderman 2, but at To advance the film we see him as a more mature character Moment in which it is. But the one that overcame Jamie Fox, and I do not understand Because it does not have an Oscar in this film, is Tom Cruise, interpreting To Vincent. He is a type that in a part of the film is the good one, does Friendship with Max, but there other times we see him as the bad guy. Y Especially this role suits Tom Cruise very well. That by the way is very good.The truth is that this movie I liked not because of its history, It means that it is bad, but for its characters and actors. They Mold the movie to your liking.I also liked the detail that did not want to make a sequel, or Trilogy, with this story, is just a movie.",8,0,2,16 August 2017
Dunkirk," The best of the year
","Dunkirk After a ship, with 400,000 soldiers, English and French, was attacked by the enemy, it had run aground in Dunkirk (France). With the enemy in the face, and the end of the war just around the corner, our soldiers must survive.Let's start with the actors. The actors who choose Nolan, I don't know where taken out but, are very good. Fionn Whitehead is very good, just talking, but that does not imply that it is a good actor. But those who steal the film, most, are Kenneth Branagh, Oscar winner Mark Rylance and Tom Hardy. Most of the latter. The film gives its own time, because Nolan admires him as an actor. It is a very nice character to their principles as a soldier, and his duty as such.The truth is that Christopher Nolan is my favorite director, I must admit. Although i also like others like Anthony and John Russo, Trantino and ultimately Matt Reeves. But I am inclined by Nolan.The effects are very good. I don't know if the planes are real or are effects, cannot be differentiated. And you also have to give a big round of applause to the sound effects. The aircraft, the shots, even breathing of the soldiers. But sometimes the music you saturated too. These 10 minutes with the same music of the violin, to me it doesn't bother me so much, but for the rest of the audience can be very unpleasant and annoying.The story is divided into 3. In the spring (1 week), in the sea (1 day) and in the air (1 hour). I liked this format. Transforms the movie much more difficult to understand (Nothing is easy in the case of Nolan, Inseption Interstellar or example). Because I can easily have been a story very slow. But Nolan transforms it into something witty.Uuslmente Nolan was characterized by making films of fiction, but this time in favor of the real.The truth is that this film, can be one of my best this year. But nothing is going to overcome The Dark Knight and Inception.The best of the year 9/10",9,3,11,6 August 2017

Django (Jamie Foxx), a black slave, is freed by a Bounty Hunter (Christoph Waltz) to catch a type and collect their reward. The reward is a friend of the former slave and travel throughout North America looking for the wife of Django, while charge rewards for the country.Let's start by the actors. Jamie Foxx as Django is a great success. I this actor was known more for The Amazing Spider Man 2: The Threat of Electro, and to see (before the movie) to the main actor gave me less anxious to see it. But this was not the case. I liked. Christoph Waltz as Dr. King Schultz is incredible its role. I didn't know that you could achieve a character with so much bipolarity and so much sympathy, was achieved. From the first moment that appeared i liked the character, what found very cartoons. These love to me. Leonardo Di Caprio as Calvin Candie is the cursed God. His character is a big that is only interested in the money. Peliando blacks when they were on their own, instead of stopping them cheered the damn.Samuel L. Jackson didn't like as much as the others. I believe that with more development I would like more. But I like the way you die XD.The screenplay is impeccable, I wonder how that would be us without Tarantino? With twists in the plot (very typical of Tarantino), characters endearing (as others do not) and villains.With one of the best executive in the world of cinema, this is one of my favorite movies of the.9/10 So Good Men",9,0,2,20 April 2017
Hidden Figures," Good
","Hidden Figures In the racist year of 1961, three African-American women will be crucial for the first man to reach space. But given the racism produced in these years they do not believe them much, even if they are brilliant women.First let's talk about the actors. The protagonist for me is Khaterine G. Johnson, played by Taraji P. Hensen, who tries to be more useful than the little that brings his brilliant mind. Like Janelle Monáe interpreting to Mary Jackson, that in the film looks for its title of university to be Engineer. But the one that I liked more was Octavia Spencer interpreting to Dorothy Vaughan, that looks for that its black companions are more the center of attention. And Kevin Costner plays Al Harrison, who after the results for space are not the necessary to advance.Personal information. The character played by ... Sheldon (Jim Parson) is good, which annoys the protagonist throughout the movie but interesting. The music in this movie is very good, very much the style that blacks listen to at that time, until it reaches the credits and the editor of the music was Pharrel Williams and Hans Zimmers there I realized the Why?The few effects you see are very good, you feel the atmosphere of the Aussies. I also like the mathematical side of the movie (that's why this and this). I liked that detail.9/10 Good",8,1,7,22 February 2017

And after finding a girl with the same skills as him, he should save her from the hands of the government.First let's talk about the actors. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is extra-ordinary as he has done for 17 years, as Patrick Steward has interpreted it the same amount of years. The ones that surprised me were Dafne Keen, playing Laura - X-23, I thought very good, and the other I liked was Boyd Holbrook, playing Pierce, nice, friendly but with a lot of government power.The address of James Mangold I found GOOD, the guide also. Many thanks to James Mangold for faithfully relying on The Old Man Logan comic.I would have liked them to explore a little more of the past, which happened to Logan and Charles before reaching this.Magenta 10/10",8,1,5,5 March 2017

The two do not do very well in their respective careers.First let's talk about the actors. Ryan Gosling does well on his character, as does Emma Stone. But it was Ryan's job for his role, in case Ryan Gosling did not have to learn all the songs that had the piano included. And Emma Stone ... it only counts and does it very well.The montage of the scenes are impeccable, very good. Especially in the scene of the bridge. Damian Chazelle deserves the Oscar because he does these kinds of scenes. But I do not think Emma Stone and Ryan Gosling do not think they deserve the Oscar.8/10 Good",9,4,8,19 February 2017
Beauty and the Beast," Beutuful
","Beauty and the Beast It tells the classic story of Disney, in which a Bella (Emma Watson) after its father (Kevin Kline) was imprisoned by the Beast (Dan Stevens). After exchanging roles with her father, Bella, is imprisoned by the Evil Beast?Let's start with the actors. Emma Watson as Bella is a Disney hacienda, unfortunately I went to see her in Spanish. For me the English seat is the best there is. Dan Stevens as the Beast can not be said any more. Because most of the work was done by the effects. But the character I liked the most was Le Fou, interjected by Gosh Gad, after realizing that he is on the bad side change sides, for a few moments. Ian Mackellen and Ewwan McGregor (Cogsworth and Lumière respectively) seemed very good, a very important impulse to the film.The music is very well used, I would put one point less than La La Land. It should also be said that La La Land and La Bella y la Bestia have different styles of music. This very well used music in this movie, it would not seem strange that I had an Oscar nomination for best song or best soundtrack.Beautiful 7/10",7,0,4,1 April 2017
Pulp Fiction," Good
","Pulp Fiction or in Spanish as 'Violent Times' The film has stories, which are crossed between them. In the first we have 2 types (Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta) working to Marcellus Wallace, and must retrieve a golden suitcase. The second is a boxer (Bruce Willis) who after winning a fight, that Marcellus Wallace said that lose, escapes with the money. And the third tells a story of the wife of Marcellus Walace (Uma Thurman) and of his addiction to drugs.Let's start with the actors. The truth is that we all were excellent. John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames. But, for me, the one that stood out from the other was Samuel L. Jackson, who with his first scene of 'I Dare You' left me crazy.Now we are talking about really baby. The script and how they are connected the stories, is the most amazing thing i've seen in the cinema. Because you can easily you do a movie with the story of Bruce Willis, or with John Travolta And Samuel L. Jackson. But all this is what we owe to a Mr Quentin Tarantino, and his partner Roger Avary.As I am of the new school of Trantino (Bastards without glory, Django, the hateful 8) and I'm used to die all (or almost all) and in this film does not pass. And it is for this reason that this film left me with a kind of hollow, wanting more, of failure, of the movie.Also i think that the actors not involved in both the film, with all the money you gave them. The film focuses more on Vincent and Jules, who were those who participated more in the movie.Good 8/10",9,0,0,10 June 2017

","Guardians of the GalaxyMonths after saving the world, The Guardians of the Galaxy will do so again. Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) located in one of his adventures to his father, Ego (Kurt Russell). He and his team must know if ego is his father or a phony.Let's start with the actors. It is part of one of the bad things. The proceedings during the movie is not in the film, as well as the interactions between them are very poor or unnecessary. But the character I liked the most was Drax (Dave Bautista). The first was the worst of the film for his performance. But in this film I don't know if your character has improved but I'm better now than in the first. His voice sarcastic, his jokes out of place... words out of place.The proceedings were not so much because of the effects, good. The effects in the film, the colors are impressive in the film. Especially in the planet Ego, all very beautiful.The GREAT! Problem that I have with the film, is that the protagonists do not have a clear objective. Already,Star-Lord knows his daddy and must discover who he is. OK, what then? Hence the film creates unnecessary interactions between the main characters with the Drax-Mantis Rocket-Yondu, side effects, and what interested us most was the Gamora-Nebula interaction. This interaction becomes a bit rare, of love and hatred. Returning to the subject of Limbo after meeting the pope of Star-Lord, our heroes are is this 'Limbo' in that unnecessary interactions were executed. But after that time (which is almost the entire film) The film returns to be moved.The jokes in the film... In all sides!!At the post-credits scenes (if they are 5) have a lot of eye...Infinity War...Very Funny 8/10",7,1,5,29 April 2017

","KONG: THE SKULL ISLAND The story goes back in 1973, when some scientists go to a deserted island to unmask the strange happenings that happen on the island.Let's start with the actors. Tom Hiddleston seemed very good in his role, I found the character a little lively. Brie Larson was the most x of the actors, their interpretation did not strengthen the film, but neither is bad. The actor that I liked a lot is John C. Reilly, like crazy, with sanity, that has been more than 30 years in the island next to the natives. John Goodman is the one presenting the plan to the government to investigate the island. The strange thing about all this is that he knew there were strange things on the island. Why did he try so hard for many people to die? And Samuel L. Jackson seemed like the typical villain of the movie that wants to kill the monkey, a villain that works well.And here come the bad things ... The initials 30 minutes found them exhausting, very boring. The leadership of the characters seemed very poor, Tom Hiddleston and Brie Larson are for more ...But all that I forget after seeing the effects of this movie, the action scenes and the design of ... of ... those things.8/10 Good",7,9,17,11 March 2017
Inception," Spectacular
",", written and directed by the magnificent Christopher Nolan. Cobb (Leonardo Di Caprio) and his friend Arthur (Joshep Gordon-Levitt) are a few bounty that next to a machine of sleep you can get into the minds of others... I think what I said well... Or something like that.Let's start with the actors. Leonardo Di Caprio is the success of the film. This type is large. You feel what he feels, on their children about everything. The film focuses on these children. And i like your experience of the subject, as expressed in the film. As if it was obvious. Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur is the friendliest of the film (With Tom Hardy). Note that after the explanations of Cobb, and we did not understand, Arthur we finished off the idea with something funny and dynamic. Ellen Page i thought it was a weird, but necessary. This is what leads us to tell us the story. Tom Hardy playing Eames is the most likable character of the film. The funnier the more caricatured. The more friendly.The special effects, for the time, are very good. That's why he won the Oscar for best effects, like the other 4 who won.The movie in general is MUUUUY complicated at first, but after seeing it 1000 times (I) understand more things. (But in my defense, I understood it to the second)The end of the movie leaves you wanting more, as all the films of Nolan.Spectacular 10/10",9,0,2,17 May 2017

Kenneth Branagh as detective Hercule Poirot, is by far the best of the film. The incomprehensible accent complicated and very sophisticated type makes it to be the center of attention in the film. The truth is that takes all of the movie, there is none that exceeds or character of the character, or in acting. All the actors, and their respective roles, they are very good. Michelle Pfeiffer, Daisy Ridley, Josh Gad, Johnny Deep, Jody Dench, Willem Dafoe, wow what a great cast!The characters in the movie are many, and it is very difficult to make that each one has his argument in the film. But this film does very well the difference between the characters, none is simple to decipher. The other detail that I liked that anyone could have been the killer, either.The bad... The explanations of the detective Hercule Poirot, are very fast and difficult to eat for the hearing. (I am already accustomed to, thanks to Sherlock) and the actions taken by the detective are very fast, and impulsive. There are also very, very uncomfortable to the director (that is the same Kenneth Branagh) that makes the movie super uncomfortable.The end, oh my God, the end is the most unexpected in the world.Entertaining 7/10",6,1,3,27 November 2017

Diana could not believe it, so it follows that the God of War, Ares, therefore Diana with Steve van at the center of all the war to defeat Ares.Let's start with the actors. Gal Gadot as Diana Prince is the best part of the film (along with Chris Pine). In addition to the action that was very good, the character is a completely incorruptible. I'm a big fan of the comic, but Wonder Woman never interested me as a character, I really don't have so many expectations for this film, therefore i saw her on the Internet... eh... to follow. As i said before i had so much interest in Wonder Woman, but to see the film and how you think the character inspired me to follow this character. Let us continue with Chris Pine as Steve Trevor. Has Chris Pine you know very well of the Spinnoff/prequel trilogy of Star Trek (directed by J.J Abrams). It is a type that I, as an actor, and this character is everything expected of him. Great character with a great personality.Dc at the end makes a good film. I without exaggeration i left vomiting of the hundred, after seeing Batman v Superman and Suicide Squad. But with this film... surprisingly... no.I like very much the meaning of war that have in the movie, as if there was a God to do that peleasen between them/us. I really liked that part of the movie.The villains I liked. But Ares I liked much more than the other villain.

What I dislike of the personage is that it killed, it kills without thinking, very furious. Henry Cavil, the actor of Clark Kent, and costs a little more than Afleck.SPOILER ALERTAnd what I did not like at all about the movie is that they killed Superman, because they kill him if it's going to cost them to relive it !? And because they did not choose Bryan Cranston than Jessie Aimsemberg, because they had to put the son with spasms that the great father !?Bad step for the second Dc Comics 7/10 movie, I was thinking of putting it in 6, but then I thought about the effects.",5,1,5,1 December 2016

It gives a Sense of seriousness to the character, proving that he is a hard man. Aaron Eckhart is very well not like Tom Hanks, but very well. The Actor's ability to level off better actors than he is very Good. The script is very well done, very well structured. Their Flashbacks are very sudden but efficient to tell us very well The story, well done Todd Komarnicki! The bad of this movie are Small things in good parts that are added, are few. He Character that plays the actress Valerie Mahaffey I think very Unnecessary, obviously should appear, but not for so long. The Needed from the North American Aeronautical Bureau to sue They seemed very forced, they would have talked more on that subject.And one Personal opinion that may or may not be part of the opinion, when Birds are flying ahead of the plane YOU WILL NOT HAVE HAPPENED TO ROTATE OR DO SOMETHING!

When they reach their destination, they can not believe what they find.Let's start with the actors. I'll try not to give them any spoilers. Or at least try it. Let's start with Katherine Waterston, Daniels. It's a weird prospect, who went through most of the movie crying, I'm not saying that Waterson's performance did it wrong made him excellent. But the character I did not like, and talking about this no character I liked. And the stupidest character I've ever seen is a blonde who's Tennessee's wife, for God's very bad and the first to die. Also tendency has this topic, I saw critics about this movie where they said that there is no connection Characters-Spectator. But the characters made for it. And I think it gives points to the movie. Returning to the actors, the only actor who excels, I think you are already imagining, Michael Fassbender as his characters steal the movie.The effects ... the effects are INCREDIBLE !!! Since the Alien is made, even the ship or the transformations of the characters in the same Aliens are beautiful.The end will leave you with your hair on end. You're going to ask, 'Who was this?' And I'm going to answer that he is the master teacher Ridley Scoot. Scoot already has experiences with these movies. Cof Cof not like others (James Cameron) I liked 8/10",7,16,32,27 May 2017
