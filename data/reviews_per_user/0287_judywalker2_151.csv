The Avengers," Another mediocre superhero movie
","I couldn't wait to see th Avengers. I thought that it would be on the same level as the Iron Man movies, Thor and Captain America. Sadly its more on par with the two Hulk movies instead. I have to admit that I am a fan of superheroes but I really wasn't into the Avengers as the cartoons contains too many whiny characters, well the movie is no different. There is too much preaching by Nick Fury, Captain America is too angry (angrier than the Hulk in fact), way too much Tony Stark and too much exposition about science that we really don't care about. The only characters that really shine on screen are Black Widow (wonderful kick ass fight screens, woman with power without superpowers), Hawkeye, Thor, Loki (until he starts getting boring) and Agent Colson. Joss Whedon usually knows how to temper his characters better but in this movie he really put together some awful dialog. Yes some of the jokes were funny but in between there were long periods of just boring stuff. It's too bad I know this will make a lot of money but it could have been so much better. It could have been a real classic but instead its not worth viewing more than once.",6,5,18,5 May 2012
National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Another mediocre movie
","Well Hollywood has done it again. Produced another mediocre action, adventure movie that people will flock to because there's nothing else to see. I thought the first one was much ado about nothing and this second edition follows suit. This movie was dull, dull, dull. All the action was ridiculous especially one long arduous chase with vehicles. Come on now no historian or bad guy can drive that great. The pivotal we're going to die seen was ripe and ready for the video game. Now I/m a history buff and the history wasn't even interesting. And I might be mistaken the movie has a decidedly adult overtone yet there were a lot of kids in the theater I went to and the short before the movie was much too disneyish but again adult oriented. Too bad for Hollywood they can't make anything but C's. 5/10",5,7,29,21 December 2007
Blade Runner 2049," Pretentious, slow and boring
","I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but I didn't expect awful. I'm old enough to remember the original movie which was innovative and interesting. Most of the acting in the original was stellar and it wasn't gimmicky. I can't say the same for this sequel (which might just be a set up for a third unfortunately). Ryan Goslings character was interesting, most of the other replicants were not. Jared Leto's character was just annoying. Robin Wright's small but interesting part was maybe the highlight of the whole film. You notice I haven't said much about Harrison Ford who is Indiana Jones old man mode.The most annoying part of the was the visuals and the music (at least I this that's what they're calling it). I though of 2001 Space Odessy but that music was actually good. It was suppose to post-war California but the sets were so dark you couldn't see the characters. In one scene I kept thinking of Mad Max and not Blade Runner. Totally a missed opportunity to make an interesting sequel.",1,60,128,7 October 2017
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," too long and boring
","Went to see this latest chapter of the Hunger Games because I hate to leave things unfinished. I saw the last film and was disappointed with the story and I felt the same about this tale. I do believe that the producers pulled together a stellar cast who definitely make the material seem better than it probably is. Donald Sutherland, Woody Harrelson, Philip Seymore Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright and Elizabeth Banks are all great, elevating every scene that they're in. I still don't care for the character of Katniss always having to be prompted to do the right thing. Well I guess I'll see the next part since I have to know how the story ends cause I just don't think I want to read the books.",6,14,27,26 November 2014
Black Swan," Beautiful, Mesmerizing but weak ending
","The Black Swan is a beautiful movie. Natalie Portman is Oscar worthy for her performance. She definitely looked and acted the part of a ballerina with great technical skills but no personal confidence. Barbra Hershey is also great as her overbearing mother. Mila Kunis is good as the supposed nemesis. The movie itself is mesmerizing. You can't take your eyes off the screen because you can't believe what's happening and you can't wait to see what's happening next. The movie only has one problem. You wait and you wait and then you see Natalie's great performance as the Black Swan. Then you get to the end and you're disappointed. For me the movie should have stopped with the Black Swan's performance, there was no need to go further. The movie is perfect up and through that point and then the bubble burst and you're left wondering what happened.",8,0,4,22 December 2010
Changeling," Felt long, but in the end I understood why
","I've been waiting to see this movie since I first saw a trailer and then I read some of the critics reviews when it opened; I was concerned. But never one to listen to critics (thank God) I went to see for myself and I was pleased. This is a good movie with a good story. Angelina Jolie is good in the role of Christine Collins, even though I find it hard to look at her blown up lips. John Malkovic and Jeff Donovan (Officer Johnson) were also good, though I couldn't find Donovan's name in the IMDb character list.I was a little annoyed as the movie seemed to go on and on but then I understood why Clint Eastwood wanted to finish the story. Though a few scenes could have been easily cut, especially on in particular. 8/10",8,16,33,31 October 2008
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Please shoot me.
","I gave up on the Pirates after the second movie but my daughter wanted to see this and I wanted popcorn. I was hoping by the end that they would just kill everyone including me for sitting through this mess. Jack Sparrow was interesting in the first movie, with a kind of strangely intriguing but yet intelligent characterization. They left the character a mystery that we hoped would be explored in subsequent films to create an interesting story. We loved the love story between Elizabeth Swan and 'searching for his self worth' Will Turner. Though the second film was a mess, the third at least gave them a closure.This film does nothing to enhance Jack's character it's just another meaningless quest of him to regain his ship again (so tired of this). Only Barbosa gets any kind of cohesive storyline and once again his character shines. Maybe he should be the3 star of the pirates instead of Jack Sparrow, then at least we might be entertained. I won't even begin to talk about how god awful all of the secondary characters were including Penelope Cruz and Ian McShane as boring Blackbeard. I also won't say anything about the pitiful secondary, poorly written so called love story between a mermaid and a member of Blackbeard's crew. It was laughable and not in a good way. I couldn't stop laughing when all I was thinking is that I wanted the poor lovesick boy to just die. Pitiful Pirates.",3,4,5,2 June 2011
Men in Black 3," Okay but could have been better
","Went to MIB III because it got a fresh ratings on Rottentomatoe.com (well just barely). This movie was just okay. It's too bad to since it has good actors in it: Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Emma Thompson and Josh Brolin. Speaking of Josh Brolin, he practically steals the whole movie from both Jones and Smith. His young agent K is one of the movie's highlights. The villain, Boris the animal is also a bright spot. What wasn't so bright was the humor. The jokes just weren't punching and no one in the audience was laughing. That's bad for a movie like this. The aliens were so so. The best in fact was the one who looked most human, Griffen. The special effects were all things we'd seen before and the time travel stuff also wasn't that innovative. Incorporating a certain historical event could also have been done better and it seems that in 1969 people weren't really very observant cause I might have noticed a few things and they didn't neuralize everyone who should have seen things.",6,10,19,26 May 2012
The New World," A waste of film
","This movie so called beautifully filmed is a total waste of film. Too much like a history lesson than a lesson about the New World, an explorer, an Indian princess and the man who would truly love her. The Indians catch on too quick but still can do nothing about the settlers that have come to drive them off the land. The come out to investigate too easily. I don't know about you but if someone shot someone from my tribe I be a little more caution to approach them. The music is nice but if I wanted to see a visual concert I do see the LOTR which is a far better movie experience. They tried but failed at an epic, too much narration, not enough character emphasis.",1,1,6,22 November 2006
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Good but we expected much better
","I loved the first Sherlock Holmes movie and couldn't wait to see this one. Before I went to the theater I was worried by some of the reviews that I saw posted, but I went into the film with an open mind. Well after the first couple of scenes I could see why the critics downgraded this movie and that's ashame. I think that Robert Downey Jr. is the perfect Holmes and in the first film, yes he was quirky but not annoying. In this film he has moments where annoying comes through. The film makers are making the same mistake that way made with the Pirates movies. In the first Pirate movie Jack Sparrow was quirky brilliant and in the second some of the brilliance remained but the quirkiness was starting to take the forefront. In the last two film quirky had taken over, especially the last. This is the same thing I see happening to Sherlock Holmes. He is a brilliant detective with a few idiocracies but they are staring to change him into a clown.I also didn't like all of the choppy camera work and there was way too much of the slow motion. It works in the last scenes with Holmes and the Professor but by that time you've had so much that you might be ready to tune out and thus the meaning of the mental battle is lost. I hope that if they decide on doing another (I don't think the box office will be as big as it was for the first movie though) I hope they go back to the brilliant Holmes and leave the quirky at home.",7,1,6,19 December 2011
The Incredible Hulk," Quality actors in an empty story
","I was surprised that they tried to do the HULK again after the previous disaster, but when I saw that they were able to get Norton to sign on I was hopeful that It might turn out okay....it didn't. I hear that Norton attempted to help them with the script; they probably should have listened to him a little more. The dialog, as with most of the recent movies was terrible. You'd think they might write something interesting when two people who haven't seen each other for a while reunite, but no. And you'd think that they might spend sometime letting us know the motivation behind a few of the characters like Blounsky, but that would be too much like, good storytelling to please Hollywood. I only gave it a 6/10 for a decent effort.",6,2,7,16 June 2008
3:10 to Yuma," And what was the point?
","My husband takes me to the movies and most of the time we see what I want. So I wanted to pay him back by seeing something he might like. And so we went to see this movie. Well, he didn't like it. Said it was dumb, wanted to walk out.This movie was like a really bad episode of a modern TV western, you know like Wild, Wild, West or The Adventures of Bristol County Jr.; something very close to those really bad B pictures in black and white that they show on the Western cable channels. Yes Russell Crowe's dialog was full of witticisms but Christian Bale's down on his luck farmer, well he was just annoying. I spent the entire movie waiting for it all to be over.This movie is another example of what's wrong with Hollywood these days. Two many actors and not enough writers. 4/10",4,4,10,15 September 2007
Source Code," Wow
","Source Code is a great movie, the best I've seen in a long while. The plot has been talked about and I think unfortunately that has turned people off as it has been compared to Ground Hog Day and Twelve Monkeys. I don't think it's like either one of those movies. It's much better than they were. The dilemma that Colter Stevens faces is very different and unique. It's more akin to Jacob's Ladder. I think that Jake was fantastic so was Jeffrey Wright. Vera Farmiga was also very good and she and Michelle Monayhan had difficult roles.I have to tell you that the ending to this movie is not inconsistent with the theme of the movie and it's not stupid either It's an ending will be talked about for years. Everyone should see this movie, but I fear only the most intelligent sci-fi buffs will go. 10/10",10,5,15,1 April 2011
Skyfall," Ian Fleming might be happy but overall a bore
","I have been waiting all weekend to see Skyfall. I know most people either love or hate Daniel Craig as James Bond but I like him a lot. He is more hard edged and I think that's what the film makers intended. This movie come on the celebration of 50th years of Bond and I think the film makers wanted to come up with the real Bond the one Ian Fleming imagined..but ultimately Bond and the film are a lore. I know now if it has to do with the modern era of technology or what we expect more from our spies and Bond has always given us more, but not this time. They should have know that they we're going to get away with this kind of cerebral, soapy story after the failure of 'Tinker, Tailor,Soldier Spy.' Audiences want to keep somethings about their flawed heroes a secret. What did I like about Skyfall? The opening was great and Daniel Craig inhabits his character as does Judi Dench, Ralph Fiennes didn't do a bad job either. Javier Bardem tore up the scream and really had me liking his bad guy character until they ruin him in the end. What I didn't like? The story was okay but the lack of gadgets hurt and the new Q was boring. I know they believed that all of the high tech computer play would suffice but it just didn't. Now the thing I hated most was the lack of realism with the final battle, too ridiculous even for a Bond movie. Bond movies always have the international calvary riding in to help showing us that England is not alone in the battle against evil, I miss that. Lastly there was no Bond girl, the dumb Naoemi Harris and the beautiful, yet meaningless Berenice Marlohe could have been written out and no one would have noticed. A Bond girl has beautiful, charm, a story of her own and she lingers past the credits but these two are totally forgettable. Too bad I really wanted to like this movie a lot. I wanted it to be a 9 or 10. I gave it a 7 for Craig, Dench and Bardem. It might make a lot of money in the first week but it will take a big and final drop quickly. You know a movie should make you feel something so that you are talking about it afterward, the audience should be chattering while leaving the theater. Well when we left Bond there was only silence.",7,2,9,12 November 2012
Iron Man 3," No so great as it could have been
","I guess I just hate female characters in Marvel movies. They just constantly get in the way and never die even if they should. I know that Robert Downey Jr enjoys playing his quirky Tony Stark but this movie showcased that quirkiness way too much (i.e. the second, third and fourth Pirates make the same mistake for Johnny Depp). The story had a nice setup and the action was of course first rate, but it just to me falls flat because some of the story elements that didn't fit together. If you're going to have the main character have angst about something then at least explain more thoroughly what he has angst about and then allow him to work through that in the end. This movie introduces Tony's anxieties but really they don't make any sense and he doesn't really resolve them in the end. I also really didn't care for the great reveal of Ben Kingsley's character, why too cartoony and dumb. So all in all OK but not great. Hope they bring the avengers back soon and I'm personally waiting for Thor cause he and Loki are a much better team than Tony Stark and Rhodie.",6,3,6,6 May 2013
Deja Vu," Deja phooey
","I love Denzel and most of his movies, but this one was, like most of them this year was mediocre at best and ridiculous at worse. A cross between Timecop and Terminator, but at least the Terminator kept going back trying to get it right. The movie was interesting until he started falling for the girl and before the girl started getting in the way. I hate it when movies cast a female for distraction. I hate it when the female does the opposite of what she's told to do. The whole surveillance and possibility of changing the past was interesting, but like Timecop it would have been more interesting if alittle reality had crept in for the ending and not the ridiculous man being able to control everything ending that we got. Just one more thing I don't know about most people but I kind of getting tried of things blowing up and the whole terrorist, patriot thing. People who do things like blow up people are mentally disturbed and we should stop making them seem anything but that in the movies.",6,5,17,22 November 2006
Finding Neverland," Beautiful film
","This is beautiful simple story of people, personal tragedy and dealing with grief. It is also a story about marital expectations and how when those expectations don't come true people don't learn to adapt in order to save their marriage. Plus it's a story about always keeping the child inside us alive no matter how old we get. Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual and Kate Winslet is extremely good. I was also impressed with Julie Christies' character. She could have been all bad but the writer decided to strike a good balance. The boys were delightful and the play actors were fun to watch as they struggled with their parts. Dustin Hoffman was good in a very small part. It's a magical film and worth at least a wonderful Saturday afternoon matinée with someone you love.",9,2,3,26 December 2004
John Wick," Just an average shoot em up
","Went to see John Wick cause I like Keanu and I had read the reviews and they were mostly positive, but I wasn't expecting much (even used my free movie tickets just to make sure I wouldn't be too disappointed if it sucked...well it almost sucked.) John Wick is your basic shoot em up that doesn't take itself too seriously and that's what makes it average. You know what you're getting from the start and you get a lot of it.There are some interesting characters (Marcus, Ms. Perkins) but for the most part you know what's going to happen to everyone, except maybe John Wick. You can sit through it but the stylized violence starts to repeat itself over and over and by the end you kind of lose interest.",5,42,92,25 October 2014
Gravity," Ridiculously average
","I went to see this movie because of its multitude of positive reviews and the fact that I like the movie The Fountain. So of course I went into this with great expectations and got very, very disappointed. The reason that the Fountain worked with its metaphysical exploration of life and death is because you got to know and liked the two leads. In this movie you quickly like George Clooney's character and quickly dislike Sandra Bullock's character. She is whiny and incompetent. She needed a longer training time. I would have quickly left her to die. She just didn't garner any sympathy because of the way her character was written, Well, now for the good things. The visuals were stunning for sure. But the drama seemed force, almost horror movie like. I wish Cuaron had done better.",5,5,10,8 October 2013
Wind River," Like an extended episode of Longmire
","I saw the trailer for this movie and thought it might be interesting (and frankly there was nothing else at the movies to see). The plot was difficult to figure out and the characters less compelling than I had hoped. The acting, for what the material gave them, was good. Jeremy Rinner was okay as the sad hero figure, Graham Greene is always great and Elizabeth Olsen as the out of place FBI agent was probably the most well-drawn character in the movie. I just didn't think it was enough for high cinema and for the reviews I had seen. The scenery was nice if you like a lot of snow and people flying around on snow mobiles. I understood the larger point the movie was making but I think the series Longmire did it so much better.",5,5,16,14 September 2017
Star Trek," Star Trek the comedy, pitiful
","First let me say I'm an old Trekkie. I liked the old series, hated most of the movies, except Star Trek II (which far surpasses this mess), hated most of the TV rip-offs except Enterprise, which could have been interesting if they hadn't fallen prey to the need to create a single villainous species to fight. This movie was pure garbage. Yes it looks quite pretty but it has the worse movie score and, quite frankly, the worst dialog I've ever endured. It was nonsensical, loud, mindless and with so many Kirk gets beat up fight scenes that I wanted to puck! The characters were comedic without any decorum at all. The continuous banter just amped up the mindlessness of the so called story. You know when a movie is going bad when they resort to Alien monsters and Tyler Perry substituting for a Morgan Freeman like character. After seeing those two things I was done and just wanted it to be over. I wish I could give this movie a 0, but you don't have one. Too bad there will be a sequel.",1,29,62,15 May 2009
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," overly melodramatic
","This Star Wars movie is for all those who didn't see the original episodes IV, V and V, because if they did they would already know how the rebels got the information about how to destroy the Death Star. This is a made up, not so great story, that was just average. The saga on film is getting old (I didn't like the other most recent installment either). Once you seen one imperial walker and X-wing fighter battle you've seen them all.I felt really bad for Forest Whitaker, this is a terrible role; good thing he wasn't on screen long. The only good performances were by dead Peter Cushing and the re-purposed imperial droid. It's time for some new ideas Hollywood.",5,17,34,18 December 2016
Captain Marvel," Typical Marvel superhero movie
","This was the typical Marvel superhero movie. They have always done a good job with their casts and characters (better than DC). The lead characters were interesting, who doesn't love Samuel L as Nick Fury and Agent Colson. The interplanetary stuff was interesting. Of course the cat was cute. The characters backstory was a little weak but I guess it had to go along with what they were trying to achieve. The movie telegraphed itself way too much which kind of took the suspense out of it. I wish it had been harder to know who were the bad guys and who were the good guys. All in all worth the trip to the overly pricey theater.",6,0,4,10 March 2019
Iron Man 2," All superheroes have Daddy issues
","I really didn't care that much for the first Iron Man. I like Robert Downey Jr, think he's a great actor. But in this gig he's just playing himself and most of the time it's not very interesting. The dialog is full the quirky one liners and maybe a little too much comic relief. And that's all fine and good, but the movie is better when Stark is silent, pensive, and not talking so much. The same can be said of Pepper. The banter between her and Stark is just irritating. She's seems to be there in the movie just for window dressing anyway. Now Black Widow (Scarlett Johanssen) could have been an interesting character if she had been allowed to really form a relationship with Stark, but no go. Samuel L. popped in and out to give great wisdom, almost like a Jedi Master. And poor Don Cheadle is given every little to do but look lost.Why did I give this 8 stars, well Downey is Downey and when he's quiet and in the groove the movie is good. And it is almost great when combined with Mickey Rourke (who just keeps getting better, banged up face and all) and Sam Rockwell who hits every note as the rival weapons manufacturer Hammer. Those three are what keeps the movie interesting.",8,0,4,7 May 2010
The Hunger Games," Very unsatisfying ending for such a good heroine
","I really wasn't sure if I wanted to see this movie as I am not a teenage girl, nor am I a reader of teen books or familiar with any of the actors in this film, but I hadn't had any popcorn for a while so I went with my too young adult daughters. The premise of course has been done before, several times i.e. running man, Logan's run and I think even an episode of star trek dealt with a similar theme. It started out pretty okay though I wish that Katniss' story had not been forced into flashbacks as it would have gave her and Peter a more sympathetic storyline. The movie was cinematically pretty and directed OK. But it got only five stars from me because the Games themselves were boring and the ending was completely unsatisfying. For a movie with such a strong heroine the audience should have been cheering in the end; but there was nothing but silence and a rush to leave the theater. Why? Because we were all stunned by the terrible last half and the completely 'this is all for nothing' ending. Too bad.",5,9,18,24 March 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Some of the critics were right, Pirates#1=fun, Pirates #2=dumb
","When I saw the first teaser trailer I definitely had my doubts about this movie. Whe I saw the full trailer I had more. I read some of the early critics opinions and had even more. When it opened and I saw the rest of the review I took heart in the fact that a lot of the critics like it (just goes to show you) and of course when it beat the records I just knew I should hurry to see it. Well I was wrong. This movie was just dumb it was really bad. From the opening shot to the closely 'to be continued' I just wanted to yell, 'let me out of this HELL!' You know the Mummy and The Mummy Returns at least had the good sense to keep in the sequel what we liked about the first movie; it even built upon it, a little. This movie not only threw away everything we liked about the first movie, it then had the nerve to add everything we hate about movies period. Let me list them: No Decent Plot, No worthwhile villain (unless you count Norington), Stupid Effects, Creature features and Teenager gross-outs. And not to mention no decent romance. I didn't give too hoots for any of these characters. Banish them all to Davy Jones Locker, please. 3/10",3,7,12,11 July 2006
Star Trek Into Darkness," dumb and repetitious
","I guess this new Star Trek if for those who no nothing about the TV series or the older movies. We who are ready know these characters and know what they would do and did aren't supposed to pay money to see this ridiculous rendition of the classic, unforgettable Star Trek with Shatner, Nimoy and Kelley. And yet this movie dovetails itself into everything thing people like me know about the old show. They say that imitation is the greatest form of flattery well this movie imitates a lot but does flatter anyone. In fact there was so much imitation that there's no movie at all just an endless series of 'Oh we're going to die moments' sandwiched in between bad dialog and dumb over the top acting. I didn't care for the first Star Trek because didn't believe that any of the actor embodied the crew of the Enterprise that does double for this movie. This movie was so bad I was bored and kept hoping the entire time that this movie would be over.",4,2,6,8 June 2013
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Don't listen to the critics, go enjoy the popcorn fare
","I didn't go into Prince of Persia with any expectations and I came out really enjoying this popcorn flix. It doesn't take itself too seriously but it's not silly either. I don't know anything about the video game and I guess that's good because I wasn't biased by it. The acting is mostly very good. Ben Kingsley always makes a good villain and Jake Gyllenhaal makes a decent action hero. The sword fighting scenes are really good and it moves along really well. The plot is simple to follow and at least doesn't insult your intelligence. It's also a nice love story that doesn't get in the way of the action. It's about out makes a family, blood isn't everything and true love does conquer all.",7,8,15,31 May 2010

X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Loud and boring
","I think the superhero is coming to an end; especially if Hollywood writers can't come up with anything better than this. Once again I have stopped blaming the actors for mediocre movies and have started placing the blame where it belongs- with the writers. There seems to be no real imagination in Hollywood. I have to admit that I don't know the whole Wolverine story and frankly I don't care. Hugh Jackman and Liev Schrieber are very credible actors in anything that they do. But the story is old and boring. The visuals were nice and of course it was loud and action packed for the fan boys. Lots of Ah!, Wow! stuff for them. But in the end just another empty, loud, boring movie about a loner with super powers.",5,7,41,1 May 2009
Constantine," pitiful
","I generally don't like this genre, horror, supernatural but I heard about the character of Constantine and thought the movie would be interesting. I am not a comic book reader so I had no preconceived notions about the story, but I did expect to be entertained...I wasn't. This is a really bad movie in all aspects, story, affects, dialogue, etc,etc,etc. And from one who is easily scared I was only shocked by the beginning sequence and not ever after that. If you want to have fun rent The Prophecy at list Viggo Mortensen played a fun Satan and Christopher Walken was a good Gabriel. If you want to be scared rent something else, but skip this movie.",2,8,28,20 February 2005
Rise of the Guardians," Nice animation but not the best story
","I saw this movie with my daughters and grandchildren and I really liked the animation but the story was a little silly. A movie like this definitely depends on its animation and like I already stated they did a really great job with that. But it also depends on its story and it was an imaginative take on some of Holiday's Mythical characters ie the tooth fairy, Easter bunny, Santa and Jack Frost (who by the way doesn't have a Holiday)and kind of a Avengers light premise. These type of story's also depend a lot on there villain and though Judd Law's voice is great and the Booeyman aka Pitch starts off interesting in the end they didn't really darken his ending as much as they could have.",7,2,6,23 November 2012
Troy," Great vistas do not an epic make
","It's sad that the screenplay for this film is really bad. I like the actors, they deserved a lot better script. I think the director should have fired whoever wrote such lousy dialog. Though I don't think you can compare this so called epic with others, you can say that has far as an interesting storyline it really lacked a lot. No redeeming character, say for Hector. People playing characters that came from no where and went no where i.e. Sean Bean's Odysseus. And a really lame love story. Unfortunately the hunk, muscles tactic didn't work, especially for an entire three hours. Also the hunk characters, except for Hector and some scenes with Achilles make you want all of the characters to just die and get it over with. As a side note, it's obvious they intended for Brad to be the star. They should have named the movie 'Achilles', maybe then I could forgive the stupid ending. No this is no epic. I was really glad when it was over. Too bad 4/10",4,0,2,17 May 2004
Terminator Salvation," Not too bad, just not very good
","I have enjoyed most of the Terminator franchise especially the first one and the last one; but this one definitely had some problems. Christian Bale is becoming a one note actor; unchanged in voice, demeanor or anything no matter what character he is playing. The poor actress who played Mrs. John Connor also got a raw deal. She's given absolutely nothing to do. It is Worthington (Marcus) and Bloodgood who have real characters to work with. I agree with some who are tried of the terminators trying to do 'retroactive abortions' on John Connor; enough!. This movie should have been about this new terminator; the missing link between machine-man-machine. Too bad the writers didn't use this to better advantage.",6,0,2,3 December 2009
Concussion," Very much like the Insider, Will Smith does good
","This film is very much like The Insider, thought provoking. Will Smith does a great job; so do Alec Baldwin and Albert Brooks. This film like so many others should give us pause; but America refuses to learn its lesson. 'No lie can live forever.' When we will we concede that just because something is the American Way doesn't make it beyond criticism. Omaulu exposed our Gladiatorial attitudes about our sports. Well back to the film. It does get a little slow toward the middle and it doesn't have the high drama of the Insider; which is kind of interesting since Football is a lot more popular and lucrative than cigarettes. I guess the NFL has successfully been able to bury this controversy as does soccer.",7,2,7,30 December 2015
The Day After Tomorrow," worse CGI wolves I have ever seen
","I guess the person who wrote this film ready wanted it to be all dramatic and scary. Something that might make people think about the environment and surviving natural disaster of prehistoric magnitude. But all they achieved was a laughable movie with the worse CGI wolves I have ever seen. Most of the characters were down right dumb especially the people in Los Angeles. I don't' remember people acting that stupid during any of the major earthquakes. The things these people did were just preposterous. Ian Holm's talent was utterly wasted in this farce. Just another special effect laden disaster for which people were suppose to fork over their hard earned money. I'll so glad I didn't, saw it on cable and after seeing this film I'm mad that my money got used to air it.",2,0,2,16 May 2005
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," redeemed by a decent ending
","I like the first movie a lot. It was fun and different. The second movie I hated. It was dull and confusing. This third movie I went to because I had nothing else to do on a Friday afternoon and I thought I would hate it. I didn't. I didn't love it, but I didn't hate it. It's hard not to write spoilers but I won't I will just say that I really hated Keirra's character in the second movie, in the first movie she made sense but in the second she didn't and in the third she doesn't until almost the end. If this movie is trying to show women in power, I say we just keep the men if Elizabeth Swann in the best we can do. Jack Sparrow continues to be Jack Sparrow just nuttier and the plots and double crosses just keep getting more stupid and confusing. In the end the plot itself only makes sense for Will and Boot strap Bill. Chow Yun-Fat and Keith Richards are wasted. Only Barbossa's characterization is worth watching, he and Jack Sparrow together are fun. Poor Norington, unlike in the second film, is also wasted. The Jamaican accented Naomi Harris' character is interesting for most of the film and then wasted in the end, as is Davey Jones. I did say I liked this film didn't I. The CGI got to be too much but the end was sweet and noble so 7/10 for that.",7,0,1,25 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Poor Jesus and James
","Both Jesus and James Brown are turning over, where ever they are. Both are missed used in this poor excuse for an enjoyable movie. I guess I should admit upfront that I didn't really care for any of the previous Spidey movies. I just can't get into Tobey as Spidey and the really nerdy behavior the writer made up for him. I prefer the comic book Spidey, no super smooth hero, but no nerd either. The Mary Jane character just continues to get on my nerves. These are the two most dysfunctional people on the planet. Raimi is good at comic relief, he should have inserted alittle more and I would have liked the film better (I missed his wife, Lucy Lawless. He should have given her a cameo, too). The special effects were okay but if you've seen one computer generated scene you've seen them all. The villains, of course are exceedingly more interesting than our hero or his whiny girl friend. And on another more serious note, there were a lot of little kids in our theater and they were in a word bored. The violence was way too much for them, the parents should have screened it first. The fight scenes were in fact on necessarily violent. I wondered after this movie was over whether or not Raimi realized how ridiculous his premise was, so its okay for Spidey by his actions allowing people to die but its not okay for villains to kill people. I know that there are a lot of people in prison today who wish they could just say they were sorry and get out, maybe we should start a movement in this country. If you're poor and steal or kill, which is about 80-90% of AA men in prison, if you say you're sorry we'll let you out to be with your daughter too. I like that Raimi but you should have used a black guy.",3,1,2,6 May 2007
Resident Evil: Extinction," Pitiful movie
","I saw Resident evil I and II on DVD I would never pay big money to watch this mess. Mostly I saw the second and third films for Oded Fehr. Too bad they were stupid enough to kill him off. This movie is all action, stupid action and no plot. But that's all you can expect from a video game and a model turned actress. Too bad the writers refuse to give you anything or anybody to truly like in these movies. And of course they left it open ended. You don't know whether the others got out of Vegas to their final destination and of course Alice swears she'll be bad to finish off the board of bad guys who started the whole thing. Well I won't be seeing Resident Evil IV unless they clone Carlos. 3/10",3,0,1,12 January 2008
The Prestige," Much better than the usual fair
","This was an unusual story, told and acted very well. It took me awhile (and I'm usually very quick) to see where it was going. Like the Illusionist it opens up many a moral dilemma for the audience. The cutting back and forth, at first, is a little hard to follow but then suddenly it becomes much easier and clearer as the movie slows down. The critics who thought that it was too slow in parts were wrong. It has to slow down in order to let the audience catch up. this movie allowed itself to be suspenseful, sad, funny and thought provoking all at the same time. It might not be Number #1 this week at the box office but it's interesting enough that people will go see if for week after week.",8,4,7,21 October 2006
Hotel Rwanda," I couldn't stop crying
","I almost didn't go see this movie. It's so hard for me to sit through things like this. It is very, very good, but you can only see it once if you have a heart or a soul. You can only go through the experience one time because you can't do it again, at least I can't. Don Cheadle was exceptional. Nick Nolte and Jaoquin Phoenix had very difficult roles. I was also happy to see Jean Reno has the hotel president. The good people anguished and the bad people schemed. The woman who played Don Cheadle's wife was also very good I really felt her fear. I agree with the critics that this movie had a message without being preachy. It should teach us a lesson, but I know the world won't listen.",10,5,8,26 January 2005
The Adventures of Tintin," Nice animation, boring story
","I knew Tintin from childhood cartoons so I was excited to see the movie version. I was sadly disappointed with this film and I hope Spielberg won't make another. The only reason I gave this film a 4/10 was for the animation. That being said, the computer generated characters were probably great to some but to me they seemed creepy. I story was corny and telegraphed itself to all but the feeble of mind. I wish they had updated the story a little. I also forgot how annoying the two comic relief characters could be. This movie's story was so bad that any small child would be bored to death. Too bad, Tintin had potential but I hope this is the end.",4,20,35,29 December 2011
Moana," Just average
",I took my grand daughters to see this Disney film hoping it would be good. It was just average with forgettable songs and a forgettable hero. They created a reasonable back story but the execution and dialog just lagged. One of my grand daughters fidgeted the entire movie out of boredom. The ending is the only thing that redeemed the movie from total disaster. Disney really should have done better with this film. They seem to have trouble when their not dealing with an already created fairy tale. I will have to say that the animation was stellar as usual which made the lack of story and character engagement the more sad. I guess they might sell a few toys but Moana in not a princess that young girls are going to remember.,6,9,25,5 December 2016
Crash," For the most part like real life
","This is a very hard movie to sit through especially for African Americans. So much of it makes you mad, then you get sad. There were only a few things that didn't ring true for me, but judging by the world today I guess you can never predict what human beings will do. It was nice to see the supposed bad guys do something good, but it wasn't as comfortable to see the good guy not take responsibility for doing something bad. My husband and I were the only African Americans in the theater when we saw this movie and we laughed a lot while the rest of the theater was silent. But at the end I kept waiting for something Hollywood to happen and it didn't; then I remembered this is suppose to be like real life, nothing Hollywood happens in real life.",9,1,10,18 May 2005
BlacKkKlansman," Timely and effective
","I didn't know exactly what to expect from this Spike Lee joint but I found the movie timely and effective. There were funny moments and moments that were hard to watch, especially for African Americans. The acting is stellar. But some of the scenes could have been better, especially in the beginning of the film. Some just seemed like empty space. We all know who this movie was directed to, it was an interesting lesson in the history we still have yet to resolve in this country. 
I'd like to address some critism of the film's portrayal of the police, I for one found it spot on. We all know there are some really bad cops and some good ones and this movie shows that sometimes they step up. I hope some of the police are this film and remember that.",7,4,7,1 September 2018
Pan's Labyrinth," Interesting
",I thought this film from a technical perspective was very well done. But I have to say that the adult characters were much more interesting than watching the antics of Ofelia (especially in her Alice in Wonderland dress). Her story was all too familiar and I knew exactly what was going to happen before it happen. It was the same for the adult characters and its too bad that the fantasy that Ofelia had didn't incorporate more of what was happening around her. The only connection appeared to be with her mother and that's ashame. Also the task that the faun had her do seemed to say nothing about her situation or the situation of those around her. It also would have been nice to know more about the Captain and his relationship to his father and why a son was so important to him. All in all a good technical film with story flaws. 7/10,7,1,3,16 May 2007
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Agree, Good but
","I admit never seeing the play Sweeney Todd so I guess I was a bit naive going into this film; I thought the play was a comedy and so I thought the movie would be the same- murder and mayhem with humor. Sadly this isn't. Yes Johnny Depp is his usual good, somber self and Helena Bonham Carter matches him and get the few laughs there are. But the movie leaves you as cold and the many slit throat bodies that pile up and it gets very tiresome very quickly. In fact what could have been a great love story, Sweeney and Mrs. Lovett, Sweeney and his former wife, Anthony and Johanna is reduced to slick blood and blank stares. Tim Burton is too much in love with his one sided view of Johnny Depp. He needs to look a little deeper and he should have looked a little deeper into this story as well. Then he could have made a great movie and we could sure use one this year.",6,1,6,25 December 2007
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Weak
",So another superhero movie. I was hoping it might be at least as good as the first if not better but alas this was really weak (just like Thor II). Some one needs to let movie directors know that action sequences (lots of sequences) do not make up for a really weak plot and exceptionally bad dialog. I agree with a lot of others that they should have developed Cap's story more. His time with his old girl was short and amounted to nothing but I guess they didn't know how not to make it too sad. You know that you're in trouble when the supporting characters are more interesting than your hero and all of your villains. Samuel L again rocks Nick Fury and we all know that Black Widow desires a movie of her own. I could have cared less about the Winter Soldier and poor Robert Redford was really out of place. Everyone should be glad that Shield folded because they really need to start over with some better guys. I hope the next one is a while cause I'm not looking forward to anymore action sequences.,5,36,78,8 April 2014
Tangled," What all movies should be.
","Disney is back with Tangled and they have finally found themselves again. First I have to say as much as I loved Tangled it made me sad and angry that Disney could not accomplish the same thing for The Princess and the Frog. Here was there one chance to showcase a Black princess and they missed the mark by a football field. Well so much for that.Back to Tangled. The animation is more than great. The characters are well drawn and thought out, especially the true villain-the old lady. Disney movies are only as good as their villains and heroines; this movie does a great job at both while also giving you a good hero. It is funny and bright, cute and sad. Everyone should spend an afternoon with Tangled. Though the music is not the 'knock your socks off' great it is good and goes well with the plot. 10/10",10,146,196,24 November 2010
Interstellar," Not as good as I thought it would be
",A friend recommended this movie to me (I have to admit I didn't want to see it in theaters after seeing the trailers) so I gave it a shot as a Amazon rental. I turned on my big screen and surround sound like my friend recommended and sat back hoping to have a good time. Well I should have but I didn't. May I should have also prefaced the fact that I hated Gravity. I like Sci fi but I guess I just don't get metaphysical because this movie could have been a whole lot better it they had left a lot of that silly stuff out. It would have been great contrast the search for a new home for human kind and the struggles of the people left on earth. It also would have been great to be honest about hard choices and letting go of anger in favor of understanding. Coop is no much about science and having his children achieve that it would have been nice to have spent more time on a world where innovation has ceased in favor of food and hopelessness. Too bad.,5,3,6,21 April 2015
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Mediocre ending to a mediocre saga
","The ending again suffers from the same problem the whole series of Rey's story suffers from, uninteresting characters, jumping from one space fight scene to another and really bad dialog. The only interesting characters are the so called villains. Poe and Finn have always been poor characters just talking and running around the scene haphazardly. Ben Solo had the most interesting story and it is hadn't been for him the movie would not be worth watching. I hope Stars Wars is over now. Enough.",4,10,16,1 January 2020
Pacific Rim," Just OK
","Took my grandson to see this movie because I thought he would like it and I saw that the critics thought it was worth seeing. It started out right, character back story, monsters, robots etc. But about halfway through it deteriorated into this muttled, mindless, silly movie with two of the most annoying characters since Transformers Revenge of the Fallen silly robot cars. They were so annoying that I wanted both of them to die. I also really hated the ending I really thought that the people they let die were arbitrary and a little stupid. The movie also didn't leave itself anywhere to go if the studio (like most of them) was looking toward a sequel.",5,1,6,18 July 2013
Gone Baby Gone," Very good and interesting, Both Afflecks proved their worth
","I wanted to see this movie as it was getting very good reviews and they were right. This is a very good and interesting movie with both Ben and Casey Affleck doing a very good job. I have to say I was put off by all of the profanity. I wish that Hollywood didn't always believe that people ( even those on the lower end of the socioeconomic ladder) go around talking like that all of the time. And if the people of Boston talk like that all of the time I'm glad I don't live there.The plot was exceptional and the cast was great. Of course the veteran actors Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Amy Madigan did their usual great job and they had so much great material to work with. But the not so famous also were right on key.There was also exceptional writing which has been missing in Hollywood of late. I am usually good at guessing what will happen next but they got me a little at the end. This movie is thought-provoking and my husband an I talked about it for a long time after it was over. This is an Oscar worthy piece that everyone should see. 9/10",9,3,7,21 October 2007
Captain America: The First Avenger," Okay popcorn flick
","Didn't think I wanted to see Captain American but I had a taste for popcorn so I went. This is just that an okay popcorn flick. The beginning is done very well and sticks close to the comic. They do well with Steve Rogers story, making it very personal. Tommy Lee Jones steals the show as usual. Hugo Weaving is also good as the Red Skull. The female lead for once doesn't get in the way like the annoying Pepper Potts or all of the Batman female love interests. Howard Stark is also an interesting character, almost like Tony (maybe too much). That's the good, now the bad. The action is sometimes well over the top and the fight scenes often go way too long. The ending is done well with an appearance by you know who.",6,6,19,24 July 2011
The Bourne Ultimatum," Could have been much better
","I have to start by agreeing with another person's comment: the casting of Matt Damon was genius and is probably the reason people enjoy these movies as much as they do. This movie started out very well and it takes some skill to start a movie out well. Very few people can achieve a good start just think about the Bourne Supremacy; I don't think that movie began well. But after the great beginning The Bourne Ultimatum deteriorates into the same old, same old, CIA, NSA bad guys against the rogue covert ops hero. Boring! Too bad they didn't use more intelligence when they wrote the script. Sure car chases and fight scenes are nice, if you're a 17-25 year old male, but come on the rest of us want to see a little more than the camera swinging around as someone gets killed. They had some great opportunities to do something really smart but they failed to do it. And let me say one more thing, the character Marie was used very well in the first movie and even Pam Landy (well played by Joan Allen) in the second, but this time both female roles (Niki and Landy)were wasted. Come on women might not need to fight but we can certainly use our brains. I got so tired of the closeups of Niki doing and saying absolutely nothing. And poor Pam Landy though heroic we never get to see how she thinks. Too bad 7/10",7,2,5,11 August 2007
Burn After Reading," Finally something satisfying
","I've waited all year for a movie that was simply satisfying. Anyone who doesn't think this movie is funny and surprising is just one of those morons that Obsorne Cox has been fighting against all of his life. I should, just for the record, admit that I have never been a Coen Brothers fan. Didn't understand Fargo and didn't even attempt to see No Country for Old Men. So after reading a few negative reviews I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but I was very pleasantly surprised and surprising is exactly what it is. I think the fact that it plays like a suspense thriller or a drama is part of the fun. When we're laughing out loud the audience really understands that they are witnessing a unique comedy. I mean people clapped in our theater and that has been rare to nonexistent this year, even for the Dark Knight they didn't clap. My husband laughed so hard he couldn't catch his breath. So I warn you be careful in this movie you might be laughing uncontrollably and choke on your popcorn or worse spit out your drink. Enjoy. 9/10",9,5,11,13 September 2008
Watchmen," Interesting but just not my cup of tea
","I went out and bought Watchmen the complete 12 episode comic so I guess I actually saw this movie before I saw this movie. It was interesting but just not my cup of tea. I knew I'd have difficulty with it having no named Hollywood stars to draw me into the characters. The acting was okay but how good an actor do you have to be to say most of the dialog. I have to agree with those who say sometimes sticking strictly to the comic is a mistake. Cronenberg took a graphic novel ie History of Violence and gave a cohesive story with a character, Tom Stahl, that we could root for. This is a disconnected group of people none of whom have any redeeming values and we're suppose to think that's great because they're 'real human beings'. Well being a hero isn't about being a human being, its about being more than you think you could be, and I don't mean more self serving.The visuals were okay but the fight scenes were overly stylized, violent and make these so called non superheroes look like they had real powers. Probably will do big business this weekend but will fade away like so many of these flicks do ie Sin City, 300 etc. By the way there was a mass exodus from the theater where I saw the movie as soon as the credits started to roll.",6,3,5,6 March 2009
Justice League," Worst movie ever
","I have come to the conclusion that the writers, directors and producers of DC movies don't like the characters. The Batman movies (not the ones with Affleck) were okay, but the villains and minor characters were more interesting than Batman. Green Lantern was ruined by silliness. Superman was a good start ruined by the introduction in Batman versus Superman of Affleck and the worst Lex Luther ever. Now JL the worst movie every made. Bad story, dumb villain and bad acting by everyone. DC for some reason thinks if they just made everything dark and video game quality that they will make a successful movie. Their wrong. Marvel has bested them because they care about the characters. Makes the audience care by letting you get to know them. Yes they have humor but its appropriate, not annoying. I feel sorry for Gal Gadot who is good as Wonder Woman and the Amazon women who are great. I also feel sorry for Henry Cavil who is a great Superman, but really wasted and acted poorly in this film. I wish DC would just stop. Wait a few years and find someone who really likes their characters. They also need to find better Batman and stick with a real good JL beginning story, maybe with Martian man hunter. Who ever they pick needs to go back and watch the animated series and not spend so much time on obscure comic books. Its the series that endured JL to its fans.",1,1,1,17 March 2018
Man of Steel," Good movie filled with poor choices
","I have been looking forward to seeing Man Of Steel for lots of reasons: 1. Henry Cavill, I think he embodies who we see when we see Superman. 2. Russell Crowe as Jar-El and Kevin Kostner as Jonathan Kent, great actors who really bring something to their roles. I also liked the casting of Diane Lane and Lawrenece Fishburne. In fact casting is something this movie does really right. The beginning is great with lots of time spent setting up the new Kryptonian story. I think this was a good choice it gave Russell Crowe some great scene time and set the tone for the movie. I think the Kal-El, Clark story told in real time and flashbacks was also a good choice. It worked really well even though it was non linear. The scene's with Jonathan Kent are good but I feel that Diane Lane's acting talents were wasted for the most part during the whole movie. But this movie is all about the Fathers so I guess I can understand it a little. At first I had trouble with the introduction of Lois Lane but I kind of got into it after awhile and thought that it took some imagination to come up with this. It was definitely different. I also enjoyed the whole fish out of water feel for Superman, for the first time the movie really showed what it must be like to be an alien, not a bad thing at all. All the good being said there were some really poor choices in this movie. One of which might just doom any franchise expectations. One was too many redundant fight scenes. Too much destruction. It was totally unnecessary and started to get boring which really blew the wind out of an otherwise enjoyable film. Again poor choice on what to do with your villain. I just really can't understand why writers make this really dumb choice over and over again. It just doesn't make any sense and really hurts future stories. The end (which I guess will be much talked about) was the worse choice and I think many will be very put off by it. It is the total destruction of the Superman image. Too bad because the rest of the movie has great promise. I gave it a 7/10 for Henry Cavill and the other great actors.",7,2,4,15 June 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," Not as fun as the first one but OK
",I took my grandson to see kung fu panda because I really enjoyed the first one. This one unfortunately is not as fun as that one but it passes. The animation again is stellar and Jack Black again does a good job as Po. I am going to disagree with the critics the story is coherent and both stories (Po's search and the peacock's) do work if you are intelligent enough to see it. What I found irritating though is that it seemed to go on longer than the 90 minutes. I think it was because on like the first one it took too long for the Po to get it. Also the fight scenes were way too long and draw out for me. Yes the kung fu was good but it seemed to go on forever. The movie did redeem itself in the end and that's why I gave it 7/10.,7,1,2,17 June 2011
"I, Robot"," Like getting a present wrapped with $100 wrapping paper with $5 bill inside
","You know that you're in trouble when only two people in the whole theatre are laughing at the jokes. I, Robot is the latest Hollywood action movie. Though I loved Will Smith in MIB, ID4 and even Enemy of the State, his acting in this movie was less than memorable. Or maybe is was just the really, really bad dialog. Except for Will's movie grandmother everyone else was forgettable at best. The plot was more than poor it was juvenile and having Will be angry because a robot saved him instead of someone else was silly, especially when we find out that he has benefited from robotics.Most of all I hated the ending. Human pride took over, so Will gets to save everyone inspite of the fact that we know that Sonny could have done it just as well. No imagination whatsoever on the part of the writers. A better ending would have been for Sonny to have saved them both. I liked the Terminator robots take over the world movies better.",3,3,6,19 July 2004
Wanted," Stylized violence meets nerdy white boy dreams
","The Matrix was a great movie. Why? Because it had a premise we could buy into. Yes it also had a nerdy white boy, but his transformation was to be a sign of a new world to come, now I take no responsibility for the mess that was made of the sequels, but the original was fun. I bring up the Matrix because I also blame that movie for the long litany of movies that came after glorifying violence in ways that make most your people numb and the rest of us just sick. Wanted is another one of those movies. It wants to be taken seriously and yet it gives too simplistic an explanation for what Wesley(James McAvoy) does. For a while I thought that it was going to dwell deeper but then of course the filmmakers pull back and revert again to stylized violence. So to every nerdy white boy who sees this movie and thinks all he needs is his own brand of assassin training, a big gun, some special bullets that shots around things from long distances and I can be in control,treating everyone that I feel wronged me. I say maybe you need to ask yourself that question they kept asking Wesley. Too bad he couldn't figure out a better, more productive answer.",5,5,12,1 July 2008
Salt," Just a little bit better than okay
","I love Angelina Jolie as a 'kick-ass' female superhero. She usually fits the bill just great i.e. Tomb Raider and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, but there was something missing in her performance in this film. Maybe it was too serious. Instead of her normal tongue and cheek were just got more and more close ups of her big, bigger lips. She has no good dialog after the opening interrogation scenes and I agree with some of the others who say she look extremely thin, almost anorexic. The supporting cast is okay mostly just giving out one liners between the action sequences. I wish they had copied the Bourne movies a little more and gave Salt more character, though the many flashbacks help some, we only learn her motivation at the very end. That makes for a long, even though it's short- 100 minutes, less than satisfying movie experience.",6,3,7,25 July 2010
Ender's Game," Another dull scifi flick
","After seeing a few of these teenager movies I know why I don't read these books. These movies are made for adolescent boys and adults will have no interest in them. Ender's Game about a gifted strategist teen is about as interesting as any XBox video game. All have plastic characters that move predictably to a predictably dumb ending. I wonder if the writers of these movies realize that the dialog gives the characters nothing to do but recite lines in order. I felt really sorry for Viola Davis for being in the movie because she was the only one that gave her lines some life and emotion. For the first time since Harrison Fords' worst movie, Six day seven nights, I could barely stand to watch him on screen. The character Bonzo was the only other one who brought some real tension to this slow and boring movie. Yes like Gravity this movie is cinematically pretty but I am so tired of movies that just look good but don't feel good, sound good or make you want to see more. I can stay home and watch cool technology on TV I want something more when I leave my warm house and shell out big bucks at the theater.",5,3,14,3 November 2013
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," predictable, but the troll was good
","Saw this movie because my daughter wanted to. I like the two lead characters but from the moment the movie started I knew where it was going. The story is dull and predictable with more profanity than I think would have been the case for the period. Some wisecracking is okay but really, this is modern dialog in a setting of 15th century. Everything in this movie is over the top from the witches to the weapons used by Hansel and Gretel; with a little too modern science thrown in. This movie stole from so many other more successful films that weren't even in the same genre. I guessed most of the story before the ending. All of the actors did the best they could with this mess. On one positive note I think the Troll design was great, better than the stupid trolls in the Hobbit.",5,3,9,27 January 2013
Dreamgirls," How did Jennifer Hudson lose on American Idol?
","This movie was much better than I had expected. I knew of the Broadway Musical 'Dreamgirls' and of course Jennifer Holiday's famous rendition of the signature song but I had expected Hollywood to mess it up like so many other things i.e. Chicago, Rent. This time they mostly got it right. This is a movie White folks will like but Black Folks hopefully will identified the true essence of the story. In fact we are living it daily if you look at the kind of musical artists that are in the spotlight now, Beyonce is a perfect example. I wonder if she ever stood back during the filming and saw her own life right in front of her. She is the acceptable Black Woman. The one that can cross-over to please the White audience. Jennifer, not Beyonce, desires the applause. Her Effie is true to life and the struggle for Black, real Black artist. Go Girl, hope Hollywood stands up and sees that you can sell, because that was the other point everything is really about the cash.",8,0,3,29 December 2006
The Amazing Spider-Man," Another mediocre marvel movie
","Saw this Spiderman reboot because my daughters were interested. Frankly I had enough with Spidey III. Probably that was because I never could get into Tobey McQuire as Peter Parker nor Kristen Dunst as annoying Mary Jane. Of course this Spiderman was suppose to be different, darker, like Batman (which by the way worked for the first movie and only worked for the second because of the brilliant acting of the Late Heath Ledger). Well it was darker and gave somewhat more of an emotional impact but that was only when we saw Peter Parker. Unfortunately the Spidey bits were the same old web-slinger, endless fight, guy getting hurt nonsense. I do have to say that I liked this new guy better than McQuire. I also think the banter between Martin Sheen (who I miss in movies) and Sally Fields was nice but poor Sally was at a disadvantage and I really didn't care for her as Aunt Mae. The villain was okay and Dennis Leary is always great. I also have to say that Emma Stone got luck, as they didn't give her the stupid female role, Gwen was actually smart, yeah.Now here's the *Spoiler Alert* and I have never written a Spoiler in my life but I am just sick and tired of Spidey having to reveal himself. He's suppose to have a secret identity people, well if he let's everyone know who he is it's no longer a secret. So can we just cute it out already.It is a movie that will make big money for a few days and be quickly forgotten like most of the summer films. But we know that they'll do a sequel now don't we.",5,2,6,5 July 2012
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Just okay
",Saw X men today and I was really expecting something great if you read the reviews but I have to say it was just okay. I guess I must be suffering from superhero overload because I just can't get in to one movie after another that is about wanted destruction of some city. I guess my biggest gripe about this movie is that once again it's just the Wolverine show. Yes Professor X and Magneto are in the movie along with Beast and few others (yes the speedy guy was funny) but most are just window dressing for another Wolverine story. I wish we had gotten to see more of the Sentinels. I wish we had been about to see them from inception to the end. That might have been a halfway decent movie plot instead we get lets go back in time to save ourselves from these really cool robots. Too bad.,7,1,2,26 May 2014
Avengers: Endgame," Mediocre and say too long
","I was kind of looking forward to the end of the Avengers, more of Captain Marvel and seeing my favorites from Wakonda possibly return. But this wasn't the great movie i expected. For one it was too soppy. Good nostalgic emotion is one thing saying and doing the same things over and over with each character is too much. Barton's story was the most interesting because it was new, the rest were rehashes. Second issue sparse Captain Marvel. She might as well not have been in the movie. The total unnecessary death of one character, even though I was glad, the death was silly especially in light of the way the story was set up. I won't even get into all the time travel rules they broke or the arrogant anti environmental stance this movie takes as they never address what Thanos thought he was doing. Just didn't sit well with me.",5,4,9,1 May 2019
Quantum of Solace," Yes, at little too much Bourne, action hero than Bond
","I want to congratulate Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace for revitalizing Bond. Hollywood hasn't had an original idea in years and seeing them do a good retool of James Bond has been refreshing. That said Quantum of Solace good have been a better film. Casino Royale was all about the new cerebral Bond and this one was about the violent Bond; it was a little too much Bourne. That is to say it was like an action hero movie, moving from one chase, fight-scene too the next with very little connection. Daniel Craig is fantastic in the role and Judi Dench has been a welcome addition since she first appeared replace the old M. Craig's scenes with Jeffrey Wright and Giancarlo Gianinni (who are both always good) also stood out. I didn't care much for the Bond Girl, in fact I like Ms. Fields better; they should have used her instead of Ms. Broodface. One brooding agent at a time. Yes, I miss the gadgets and the humor of the old series, but that was the old series, that's gone and people like Roger Ebert need to get over it. Today when Hollywood is giving us very little to leave our homes for seeing a new Bond isn't that bad. I would have given it an 8 if it hadn't been for the final sequence, which was very irritating. 7/10",7,0,3,15 November 2008
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Really makes you long for the better movies
","I really didn't care for the first installment of the Hobbit so I was hoping that the second would be better....well it wasn't. From the beginning seen (the one that I had to explain to my grandson, seeing as the two characters had already met) to the end so called cliffhanger this was a really poor attempt to make a dramatic movie. I have been saying from the beginning that Jackson bit off more than he could chew trying to stretch this simple book into more than one movie. This middle movie is a perfect example of this stories short coming as a series. It was boring, then there was a battle, then more boredom. The dialog was a rehash and the music. I just couldn't get past the really awful music. Must is supposed to enhance a movie not work against it. I am really not looking forward to the next one. Maybe I'll wait till its on DVD or cable if this keeps up. Going home to watch the good movies.",3,19,39,13 December 2013
Batman Begins," the problem with this movie is too many villains
","I'll start by saying that I like Christian Bale as Batman and also the supporting cast was very good, Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Liam Neesom, and Rutger Hauer. I did have a problem with Katie Holmes. she just seemed too young for an assistant DA and lacked the vigor needed in the character. This could have been a good movie, the first serious, real look at Batman. It was very true to the character but there were too many villains. Dealing with Gotham's city's corruption and Dr. Crane would have been enough. They should have saved Ra's Al Gul for another episode. Just as a side note I loved the Batmobile. It was realistic and very cool. 6/10",6,2,8,15 June 2005
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," A good ending makes up for a bad beginning
","I for one am one of those who thought that Peter Jackson should have done The Hobbit first or not at all. After seeing this movie I am still of that opinion. The Hobbit is the first of the Tolkien books that I read but it was the LOTR trilogy that I fell in love with. I knew when I heard that Jackson was making this movie that he would have to embellish but I didn't know how far he would go. Others have written that he sticks to the book but on closer examination he's changed the story quite a bit to make it more dramatic for adults. Some of it works and some of it doesn't. The beginning could have been better; too much exposition. I was really a bit disappointed by the Troll segment; this is an important part of the story and I don't think it he handled it very well.Also I was disappointed with the music. I guess when you have scored so many battles you run out of ideas, I feel for Howard Shore.Yes there were somethings I liked a lot. Some of the dwarfs are okay and Ian McKellan is always great. Martin Freeman takes over Bilbo very well. Seeing Rivendell again was also nice. Jackson always manages to save himself with a good ending so I gave it a 7 instead of a 5. Here's hoping the second and third (hate that he broke it up into three) will be better.",7,3,12,15 December 2012
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Good but lacking
","I loved the first How to Train your Dragon and I was really upset when it didn't win the Oscar that year; I still say it go robbed by the sentimental favorite Toy Story 3. So I couldn't wait until they did it again. The first promo looked promising but the more I saw the subsequent trailers the more I worry about Hiccup and Toothless story getting lost in endless dragon battles. For the record I agree with a lot that they really need to rethink trailers that give away crucial surprises in the story; it's getting to be quite irritating. Also I feel that things they mistake for drama and heart really seem to fall flat and that is the case with this sequel. It really kind of turned into a sappy, preach feast that really lacked the emotional impact of the first movie. And the ending monologue by Hiccup was really awful; it sounded like he was giving a political speech instead of wrapping up a kids film. I do have to say that the visuals and animation are still the best I've ever seen second to Frozen. They really do a great job with the aerial sequences and they kept some of my favorite music from the first film, though I would have like to have had more great new music. Again some his and some misses but we still love the characters and the dragons.",8,0,3,16 June 2014
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Irritating movie
","MI-4 is another irritating action movie that thinks its cool because it has Tom Cruise climbing on a building and concept cars. This movie lacked any type of plausible story. Of course it makes it's adversaries look like idiots and has a really annoying comic relief electronics man. I really hate when script writers think that making everything go wrong builds tension. Tension is built by having smart characters do smart things and still the hero comes out on top. This movie makes it look like spies go into the field with lots of faulty equipment. These items would be throw away by Bond's Q. I guess it's just par for the course for these movies, the first one was the only one that carried any weight in the spy genre.",4,3,8,12 August 2012
Avengers: Infinity War," Just okay
","I guess I didn't really know what to expect from Infinity War but like everyone else I was stoked to see it. I must be getting tired of the Marvel Universe because I thought this movie was very mediocre. I didn't get what they were trying to do with Thanos and the kind of ridiculous ending. After the extra post credit stuff I kind of left the theater with an 'Do I really care anymore.' I kind of got the feeling that the rest of the silent audience were either confused, stunned or didn't care either.",6,7,18,30 April 2018
Django Unchained," Not a fan of Tarantino but it was OK
","I went to see Django unchained because the trailer intrigued me. To see Leonardo DiCarpio as a bad guy and Jamie Foxx as a good guy I thought that would be fun. First I have to say that I am African American and I am not a Tarantino fan (never saw pulp fiction or kill bill), plus I don't really go in for gratuitous violence but I was able to sit through the film because the violence was so cartoonish and over the top (except I chose not to look at the screen during one particular scene). No this is not a history of slavery, no this is not an accurate depiction of anything having to do with slavery. It is a conglomeration of everything the film maker knows about the period with lots of fiction thrown in. Was I offended as a Black Person, No. I liked seeing Jamie Foxx as the hero. I also enjoyed watching Samuel L act up a storm. I also really enjoyed Christoph Waltz as the German dentist turned Bounty Hunter. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Kerri Washington had so little to do during the film. Leo was a hoot as Candie the vicious slave owner. I gave it a 7/10 for the story.",7,3,9,28 December 2012
Drive," Total waste of time and driving.
","Went to see this movie with my daughter hoping it would be better than the movie I saw the previous day. It wasn't. Drive, should have been about a driver. You know a Steve McQueen type guy who is a stunt driver by day and a getaway drive by night. It should have been sequence after sequence of cool getaway driving or cool stunt driving with an interesting character study of a man who drives and loves cars in between. It wasn't and that's the problem with the movie. Between endless sequences of silence we get bad dialog by stupid, old, white gangsters and stylized violence; which put together produced one boring movie where the only character we actually care about for a second is in the movie for a second. What a waste, this should have been a good movie.",1,50,108,18 September 2011
Frozen," Nowhere close to Disney classic
","Went to see Frozen because I heard that it got some good reviews and it looked like it might be something enjoyable. As far as Disney movies go it looked great. This animation on was par with Tangled which I really thought was beautiful. The movie started well and the first musical number was good so I thought that it would just get better. But then something happened the story just started to fall flat. The story began getting less interesting and the music started to get really forgettable. In fact when I left the theater I couldn't remember a single melody, that's unfortunate. On a side note I agree with some who feel that the story was slanted too much toward the uninteresting sister Anna instead of Elsa who was the Snow Queen. It was like they were afraid to talk about her struggles and went down the happier, easier path of Anna, love and perkiness. This was a real missed opportunity for Disney to do something memorable for kids who through no fault of their own are different than others. They could have used Elsa's story more effectively and the music could have reflected her beauty and danger better. Too bad. I gave it a 7 for the animation mostly. It's not a classic but it's pretty to look at.",7,7,15,28 November 2013
2012," Worst movie ever
","I got 2012 from Netflix cause I knew I didn't want to buy it or pay to rent it (free month on Netflix). This is the worst movie ever (never saw Battlefield Earth, but this writer should apologize too.) This movie has the worse plot, the worst acting, the worst special effects. I mean the special effects are so bad that I wonder if they even used modern technology to do them and if they did they should sue the company that produced them. I really felt for only one character during the entire movie and that was Danny Glover playing the president. I wonder how in hell he got talked into being in this movie. I didn't really have high hopes when I first saw the trailer but I thought it might be a least fun, it wasn't.",1,5,7,1 April 2010
The Lion King," Somethings should be left alone
","There are some movies that are just great, like the original Lion King (animation). This great movie was followed by an even greater stage play. Well Disney should have left well-enough alone. This movie is a poor third. Unlike Planet of the Apes, Disney didn't get any emotion out of their CGI animals. Their faces are blank when their mouths are moving. Yes the cinematography is great and the music sounds okay but just doesn't go with the these computer generated characters.",5,1,3,20 July 2019
The Bourne Legacy," Dull and pointless
","The first Bourne movie was really the high point for this now foursome. Matt Damon was quiet and controlled in his portrayal of a man who had loss his identity. Like a lot of the fans of the books I was disappointed that the second movie didn't use the book's story and the third movie except for Matt Damon and Joan Allen was forgettable. So now comes this reboot and frankly I was hoping for more but not expecting it. Jason Renner is okay in his role but his role is part of the problem. Jason Bourne you cared about, Jason Bourne you could identify with and that's probably due to Matt Damon's performance but also it was due to the fact that they made Jason Bourne a real flesh and blood man. The same cannot be said for this new 'Outcome agent'. They hint at his back story but their so concerned with leaving themselves something to talk about in the next film that the audience frankly doesn't get this new character. Yes he fights great, runs and jumps but you've seen it all before. Inbetween those moments there is a lot of nothing from him. In fact his chatty nature really works against the whole character persona of these guys who exist but don't exist. The behind the scenes in Washington with, the brilliant Edward Norton and Stacey Keach (who I was glad to see) is far more intriguing but they the story doesn't allow for what could have been some really great stuff. Poor Rachel Weitz who I also think is a great actress is totally wasted until the end of the movie I really wanted her to die. Well I'd say that this is the end of Bourne but I know that's not true.",4,4,12,11 August 2012
Cars 2," The first misstep for Pixar
",I love Pixar movies and shorts and I enjoyed the first Cars. But I can honestly say that this is Pixar's first misstep. Let me start with the excessive violence that this movie presents. It's opening sequence alone makes me question some of the decisions Pixar make of this movie. The graphics continue to be stellar but the story is subpar and that's what we go to Pixar movies for. Also with Pixar their previous films are as entertaining for adults and children which is not the case for this story at all. It has too many adult themes and is kind of boring for children. Lastly this movie is preachy and lacks the usual heart found in previous Pixar films.,4,7,14,27 June 2011
Hero," Universal themes
","I gave it 7/10 just because I don't care that much for martial arts movies with a lot of needless fighting and choreographed encounters. But I do think that this was a better told story than Crouching Tiger, easier to understand. It also had universal themes, unifying a country, self sacrifice and warriors having to put down their swords to become leaders. These are not communist or socialist themes as some have said. Seems to me unifying a country was the theme of 'Manifest Destiny' on this continent. I liked the story of Snow and Broken sword, seems to be it was truly their story more than nameless'. Also I liked the ending even though if was a little melodramatic.",7,0,0,4 September 2004
X-Men: Apocalypse," Another boring superhero movie
",I had heard that this X-men movie was good. I did enjoy the last one but I thought this was just a rehash of the same old thing. Aliens have always seemed to have a fascination with Egypt at least that's what the movies would like us to believe. So here comes another mutant creature here to take over the world followed by fight scene etc. The actors were good even though my daughter was a little confused by Storm you'd have to know a lot about the comics to understand why she would be in Egypt. I did feel sorry for Magneto and Mc Avoy's professor X has always been good. It was nice I guess that they included Wolverine. I just wasn't blown away by the story; well how many times can you take over the world and not get bored.,3,11,23,30 May 2016
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Excellent start that quickly deteriorates to silliness
","The Amazing Spiderman 2 starts with one of the best opening sequences that I have seen in a longtime. We get so much information concerning the Peter Parkers' parents (I don't think that saying this is a spoiler). I was really glad that they included this part as the first movie left us confused about what Peter's father had really done. But after that the movie quickly deteriorates into one stupid action sequence after another interspersed with an annoying love story between Peter and Gwen. It's really too bad because Gwen was a decent unobtrusive character is the first movie but in this movie you really want her to go away. There were a few good things Chris Cooper as Norman Osborn. The introduction of Harry Osborn could have been better as I think his story was really rushed. I have mixed feelings about Jamie Fox's Electro, he certainly is much less annoying as Electro than the stupid Max character. All in all this movie is just average just like many of the sequels have been. On another note I really think we're getting into superhero saturation, too many movies with the same plot over and over, enough already.",5,10,21,3 May 2014
The Illusionist," A beautiful movie
","More people should have seen this movie, it's far better than the garbage Hollywood has given us lately. It's a beautiful movie with superb performances by Edward Norton, Paul Giamati and Rufus Sewell. It reminded me of the movies Hollywood use to make before blockbusters and unnecessary special effects. The effects in this movie served a purpose and didn't overshadow the actors and their story. It would have been nice to know what happen to Paul Giamati's character, a good man caught in politics, but maybe that was the point. Maybe the moral of the story is that you can't be a 'good man' and be involved with politics or monarchs or presidents.",7,1,1,22 September 2006
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," 5/10 for the Surfer
","Lame, lame, lame. That's the only word that comes to mind when I think of this movie. I went mostly because I wanted some real popcorn. I grew up with super heroes like Batman, Superman and the Fantastic Four. It's just too bad that number one Hollywood has become so devoid of original ideas that they have to keep doing the same thing over and over again and number two its too bad that if they are going to use Marvel material that they don't take the time to get it right. The other thing that really ticks me off is that Hollywood also seems to be devoid of good writing. If a good writer had been on this film it might have been much better. The subplot might have been interesting to explore if it hadn't been messed up by cheesy, stupid dialog. The whole issue of fame is a much needed discussion for our times. Too bad that a good writer couldn't be found within hundred miles of Hollywood. I am so tired of bad to mediocre I could barf.",5,1,3,25 June 2007
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Talk about boring
","Rented this movie on DVD because I knew I wouldn't have paid big bucks to see it. Let's just say I have never been so bored in my entire life. This movie moves so slowly that I almost turned it off before it was over. It was like watching Forest Grump in slow motion. Yes Brad was his beautiful self, even when he was old and Cate Blanchett was good, I guess though I really hated her character at lot. Also I guessed the ending before it happened and the old this is happening during a hurricane thing didn't work for me. Also the clock was just a distraction that really did n't add anything to the story. I wished I had read the original story to see exactly what the author was trying to say about life. I have a feeling that the story about the clock maker was better explained as I think his reasoning for making the clock was the real point; but I think the film maker missed it. He was too busy making Brad Pitt age backward.",5,5,9,17 June 2009
Transformers," Pretty good until the ending
","I am a huge fan of the old cartoons and was kind of excited when I saw the trailers for this movie. Not being a great fan of Shia LeBeouf I was really afraid that he would turn me off to the flix. Well lucky for me and the star the character actually fit his quirkiness to a tea. I can't say the same for the female interest of the film, who appeared much to old and sophisticated for this supposed High School geek. Of course the CGI on the autobots and decepticons was fantastic but some of the fight screens went by so fast you couldn't really see what was going on. I am also glad the movie didn't take itself too seriously. There's a lot of humor and it makes for a better movie because come on who would take this plot seriously. That's why I was so disappointed in the final battle sequences when all of a sudden everything was so serious and well dull because of it. But up until the end it's great popcorn fun 8/10.",8,1,3,4 July 2007
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Not as good as I had hoped
","I really wanted to see this movie. I really thought it would be cute and that my grandson would love it. But after seeing it all I can say is that it was okay. If started out extremely promising and the animation is really great. I really enjoyed the character of Flint, Steve and Flint's father. I really didn't get into the weather lady, Sam that much. I was enjoying the film until the last 30 minutes. Somewhere it got stupid and really slow. All I kept thinking was let's just get this over with, how much longer can they stretch this out. My grandson was getting as fidgety as I was. Then finally it redeemed itself partly with a okay ending. Too bad it was so uneven.",6,3,9,31 October 2009
Children of Men," I just wanted it to be over
","I went to this movie after reading the critics lavish reviews. I went reluctantly. Why? Because when I first saw the trailers I knew that I wouldn't like it. But being a fan of the cinema I thought I'd give it a chance. I love Sci Fi and I have come to like Clive Owens- but I hated this pitiful movie. Number one I guess its a British movie thing, yes I know we ignorant Americans, but gee all of the Brit speak without explanation kind of got on my nerves. Along with the endless ethnic chatter amounting to nothing. And then there is Clive mumbling just like he did in Closer. He was cool in Sin City because he spoke clearly for the first time in his career. This was a movie with no emotional connection to the characters, a really stupid story with people doing just plan stupid things for apparently no reason and an ending that didn't leave me at all hopeful for the human race.",2,7,14,12 January 2007
Million Dollar Baby," I can't figure out why people thought this was so good
","I think Clint is a fine actor and director and certainly Hilary Swank is a good actress. Of course I love everything Morgan Freeman has ever been in, he's the always great. But I can't understand why people thought this movie was so great. Sure we feel sorry for Frankie and Maggie but the story is a story we've all seen before. Poor girl finds grumpy old man and they both learn to love each other. So what. I also thought that the ending was totally made up. I work in the medical profession and I can tell you it would never happen like it was portrayed. A competent adult, especially one who can speak as clearly as she could with a tracheostomy tube in, would be allowed to make her own medical decisions. So though the performances were good the movie itself was just like the rest okay.",4,0,3,28 January 2006
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Bad legacy for Star Wars
","Starting with Episodes I, II and III Star Wars lost something. This trend toward poor storytelling, unnecessary characters and repetition. This continues with the new episodes. This episode was not only redundant but irritating. The plot was telescoped a mile away, the villain (both villians) weak. If the writers of the new movies want to just repeating the same old thing this trend will continue. Fight scenes for nothing, creatures for nothing, excessive silliness and dialog so bad a child could have written it. Star Wars is about imagination and these movies lack imagination totally. It's too bad because this series could have gone on for a while. The writers should have taken a lesson from the animated clone wars.",3,3,4,27 December 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Better than I expected
","I took my daughter and grandson to see this movie; I hadn't planned on going but I read the reviews and thought it was worth a shot. It was better than I expected. The story was pretty much the same old Marvel stuff; mostly predictable but the characters were good and humorous. The integration of 80's music was also fun. I do have to say one thing this movie was visually stunning but I'm still glad that I don't do these in 3D, I would have probably been sick afterward. I do think that the human characters were upstaged by the raccoon and the tree (can't believe Vin Diesel was paid money in this film and only said probably ten words during the whole two hours). One post note skip the after credits piece it doesn't add anything to the story or the marvel universe; just really dumb.",8,1,2,10 August 2014
Clash of the Titans," Boring, not even a shadow of the original
","I guess Sam Worthington's the new darling of Hollywood. Well he better start picking some better projects. I mean, Terminator Salvation, Avatar and now this snooze fest, Clash Of the Titans. This movie had the worst dialog I've ever heard in my life. The writers should be ashame to put out something as bad as this. The story was lame and I think poor Perseus must have said the same thing about fifty times. Ralph Fiennes also needs to find a new agent, between Harry Potter and this mess people are going to start forgetting that this is the same man who starred in the English patient. The same can be said of Liam Neeson too. Both of these actors are too good for this kind of mess. I was relieved when this movie was over. Hopefully they won't make a sequel.",4,2,6,6 April 2010
The Adjustment Bureau," Cinematically pretty but ultimately lame
","I read several reviews before I saw the Adjustment Bureau so I already knew that it would not please my scifi or fantasy needs. I had already heard that those elements were limited and that the story was basically about love. Well I consider myself a hopeless romantic so I thought I would at least be pleased with that aspect of the movie. Alas I was not. This movie is cinematically pretty, mostly well acted, a bit humorous at times, but ultimately very lame. Again as has been the case with so many movies the past several years, the writing is poor. We're still waiting for a story that will blow our socks off. And that doesn't just mean a thrilling story, it means an interesting story or an ordinary story told in an interesting way. This movie was so telegraphed that I just wanted them to get to the ending that I knew was coming so I could do home. Too bad once again. Don't even think I want to see this one again on DVD.",6,3,6,4 March 2011
Black Snake Moan," Could have been a lot better
","Went to see this movie because my husband loves the Blues. We had seen the trailers and didn't expect much. My husband liked it; I didn't. The movie is difficult for women, especially Black women to sit through. The story is really incomplete and would have been a lot more interesting if they had focused on Lazarus' story more than Rae and her husbands marital, sexual and anxiety problems. I would have liked to know what happened between Lazarus and his wife, beside what he told us. What was his marriage really like? Was he really the innocent victim he makes himself out to be? I seriously doubt it. That would have been very interesting if the writers had chose to pursue it. 4/10",4,10,23,4 March 2007
Prisoners," Not great but not bad
","I have been waiting to see Prisoners since I saw the trailers. I do agree with others that for the first time in a long time the trailers do not give everything away. I believe that the acting was top notch, I was disappointed that the black characters had so little to do as Viola Davis and Terrance Howard are great talents. I can usually guess most of where a movie is going and I have to say that I did guess most of this one but that didn't keep me from liking the movie and there were a few things that surprise me (which is very rare). It is a movie that will make you think some and for that its a good movie.It's suppose to be high drama but there were some humorous parts and even with the gravity of the end I found myself laughing at it. I'm not sure if I was suppose to but it was funny, the expression on Det. Loki's face.",7,1,2,23 September 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Too much of the same
","I will have to admit before starting this review I am one of the ones who wished that DC had bet Marvel out of the gate. That being said I enjoyed the first two Iron man movies, the first Thor, the first and second Captain America but The last Iron man, Thor and now this its just too much of the same thing. I wasn't going to go see this movie because I knew that after you destroy one city you've destroyed them all but I was interested in hearing James Spader do Ultron and to see what they were going to do with Jarvis. The more the movie went on the less I cared about even those two things and I really didn't like the whole Black Widow/Banner/Hulk thing. And the Hawkeye story was just unnecessary and pointless. I really hope that this is the end of the Avengers for a while but if the ending is any kind of hint I guess they'll be back.",5,12,25,4 May 2015
The Dark Knight," Not really sure what to call it, but it's no masterpiece
","I went into The Dark Knight with great anticipation. Of all the superheroes, I love the character Batman (at least the one in the comics and the more famous cartoon series, even Batman Beyond). This movie starts very slow, so I waited and waited and waited for this great, awesome masterpiece...but it never came.The reason Batman is such a great character is that he like Two face has two sides. In this movie we never see them. He one sided, one dimensional overshadowed by every other character in the movie, especially Heath Ledger's joker and Gary Oldman's Jim Gordon. We see real emotion in these characters, we even see emotion in Micheal Caine and Morgan Freeman's characters but no emotion from our hero/antihero Batman. All we get is a long convoluted story to catch a madman and a horribly, over the top raspy voiced super human, thug. The writers don't ever take the time to dwell into the psychology of this man who night after night goes out to fight crime. Even when he confronted with copycats we see little emotion from Bruce Wayne, just dumb dialog.Now I thought Katie Holmes was bad in the Batman Begins but Ms. Gyllenhaal is worse and sorry to say this but I was glad when they killed her. She was pitiful looking and annoying. Aaron Eckhart is okay as Harvey Dent but I wish they had the guts to use a Black man like the original Dent.Lastly I want to say a few things about the so called message. Good writers can make a point without smashing you in the face with it. Obviously these weren't good writers. The film reverts to suspenseful music in the place of real suspense and give us two boats filled with plastic characters, when they should have spent that time not showing us what they were doing but what Bruce Wayne/Batman was thinking and feeling. But instead we got long-winded preachy speeches and an obviously wounded hero running off like nothing was hurt. By the look on most of the patrons faces in my theater, they were disappointed too. Too bad, Ledger's Joker steals the show and Batman is buried by him.",7,3,7,21 July 2008
Blood Diamond," Good for DiCaprio, bad for Djimon
","Blood Diamond (as well as Departed) certainly proved that Leonardo can act. His character of course was the most developed, well he was the star. Too bad the other characters were not as well done, especially poor Djimon. When is someone going to figure out that this guy can do more than just scream. I mean, come on, he's handsome and appears to be talented. Why not give him something else to do. Ona another note as an African American I am sick and tired of the White man saving the African movie storyline. How come Africans can't save themselves like in Hotel Rwanda. Poor Jennifer Connelly was under used and what were the producers thinking when there was no sex between Leo and Jennifer, no wonder this movie didn't do well at the box office. Well Hollywood lacks imagination. 5/10",5,1,4,28 March 2007
Avatar," A boring cliché of too many other movies
","I went in not expecting very much from Avatar having seen the trailers and reading about the story and of course I was right not to expect much. This movie is a bad Saturday morning cartoon. It's too long and too boring. It rips off too many other movies. If you're going to use a story that has been done too many times i.e Pocohontas, Dances with Wolves, The Matrix,even District Nine you'd better have either a compelling star (that is someone we want to see in this movie) or a twist that is interesting. This movie didn't have either of those things. Also you know I wish that writers would really take a good look at their material before they turn it over for use. The dialog was terrible. Too much narration, you know you're in trouble with a story when you need narration to move the story along. The visuals were nice but we've seen if all before, nothing new here at all. I only gave it a six for the pretty colors.",6,5,11,20 December 2009
Super 8," Definitely could have been a lot better
",For a film by two good storytellers (Spielberg and Abrams)this movie lacked a compelling story. The actors were very good I have to say they did the best they could with the material they had. It was slow and really didn't get going until well after the train derailed (not a spoiler since it's in every trailer). The human story was okay but the monster story sucked. On another note I wish that writers could find a way to write stories that didn't have unnecessary foul language in it. The way these young kids talked was ridiculous and really turned me off. This is a scary movie and really isn't appropriate for kids under ten and that's part of what's wrong with it. It should have been more ET and Close Encounters and less Lost. 6/10,6,2,8,13 June 2011
Up," Sometimes I think Pixar is more for adults than kids
","I saw Up today and I've been waiting for it to come out. But sadly I thought I would enjoy it more than I really did. It started out great. I agree with most of the critics that the montage showing the two lovers growing together and the loss of the wife was really something akin to the 'When she loved me' scene in Toy Story 2. And the end of the movie was very touching but in between it was predictable and I have to say very boring. Needless to say the animation was, well PIXAR, can't say anything bad about it. The colors were brilliant and the characters lifelike as usual. But the last two movies made by PIXAR were more for adults than kids. My grandson was bored with this movie and WALL-E especially after all of the popcorn was gone.",7,2,5,31 May 2009
National Treasure," Indiana Jones with one interesting character
","This is a Saturday afternoon popcorn flick at best. Another one of the mediocre movies of 2004. An unimaginative version of the last Indiana Jones movie without a single memorable character. There were a few good lines but so many cheesy ones that the poor good ones are easily forgotten. A movie filled with plot wholes, inept villains and FBI agents. A really predictable and unsatisfying ending. In fact (my spoiler is next) I think it would have been so much better if they hadn't found any gold or monetary treasure just more history like in the Indiana Jones movies. What's treasure to an historian is information about the past, not fast car and big houses. Even the Mummy movies knew that.",5,2,4,28 December 2004
Limitless," Ultimately limited and disappointed
","Limitless could have been a great story that highlights addiction in our society. Addiction to pharmaceuticals and to power. Here is a guy like a lot of people in our society, supposedly down and out who then is given a drug that makes him smarter. What does he do with it, well what every man in this capitalistic society would do-he finds a way to make lots of money. The story does a good job of making you feel his addiction which I guess is because of some decent acting. The problem is the ending of the movie. Everyone who has become addicted to this drug is faced with the consequences except for the principle character. This is a mistake. There are always consequences when you are addicted to something whether it be drugs or power. There are always consequences when your actions are nothing but selfish. The movie should have had the guts to show that.",4,43,65,27 July 2011
Inside Man," Quite good and unusual
","Well this was quite good and very unusual. I went into this film hoping for a good flix, since I hadn't seen one is a long, long, longtime and I was very pleasantly surprised that I actually got one. This film is interesting in that it felt quite real so I guess the acting must have been good. Most of the characters felt right. Spike Lee did a good job at choosing his cast. It was more of an ensemble than a true Denzel vehicle and that was okay. Loved the cultural, what we feel and think about people undertone. Also I loved the smartness of the dialogue especially among the policemen, that was a first. All in all a good adult movie. As a sideline I wonder if theater owners will ever get enough gumption to tell parents when it isn't appropriate for them to bring their children to R rated movies. If they can't find a babysitter they should chose another film to see, as a family. Just my opinion. My husband and I, both adults, really enjoyed this movie.",8,1,2,28 March 2006
Les Misérables," Big Budget Bore
","Saw this movie because my daughter liked the music, grant it she had never seen any previous adaptations of Les Mes and I knew that when she found out what it was really about that she's hate it...and she did. I really have never understood what people thought was so great about this story or its music and this movie really brought that home for me. The whole thing was predictable and really kind of stupid. The music was repetitive and anti-melodic . The only good characters were the innkeeper and his wife because at least they were well drawn out and their song made sense. None of the singing was that great, but I expected that but the music made the bad singing even worse. I guess there are some who will say that I am crazy and that this is the greatest musical ever, well I'd say to this that I wished I had enjoyed it. No one likes to pay good money for something they hate.",5,3,10,30 December 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Not much fun
","I loved the first Guardians for its mix of action and comedy; but this movie substitutes comedy and silliness for a decent story. I don't know much at the Guardians from the comics, but I hope their story on paper was better than this. I was excited to see them introduce Kurt Russell as Peter's father but come on they couldn't do anything more interested with him. The story was kind of childish with too much forced family melodrama and dumb jokes. Also for a movie you'd like to bring you kids to there were too many adult references and too much violence. These characters were interesting in the first movie but a whole lot less interesting in this one.",4,1,3,7 May 2017
The Da Vinci Code," Not interesting enough for me to read the book
","I have to confess right up front I didn't read the best selling book and this movie is not interesting enough to make me go out and buy it. I could never understand how this news concerning Jesus would 'shake the world'. Once again it seemed to me the same old thing, man's desire to bring everything down to his level. The characters, with the exception of the 'Teacher' are not very well hashed out in the movie. Ron Howard, who usually does a good job< really doesn't let the characters grow on you before they are running for their lives. Doesn't really set up much of a connection. I agree with everyone who said that Tom Hanks was really, really, really wrong for the part of Langdon. He has no, I repeat no charisma at all in this movie. He's really out of place. All in all it was boring.",5,5,9,22 November 2006
Thor," Wasn't great but it wasn't bad
","Went to see Thor because the trailers made it look interesting. I will start with the look of the film which really was very good. The Asgardian planet was impressive and the effects were mostly believable (except for one particular scene on a bridge). The beginning sequence offered a lot of promise as it was pretty quick to get going and quick to set up the concept and the characters place in the story. Maybe it was too quick because the rest of the film seemed to take that quickness lead much to the detriment of the last portion of the film. I have to say the dialog was snappy and the humor was not over the top or silly. What turned out to look silly were some of the more dramatic parts; the dialog there failed in a lot of the most important scenes. Also I agree with a lot of the critics that Thor's transformation into egoless, humble guy was way too quick. Again this speaks to the rush the movie was in to get to the next fight scene or special effect. All in all it was worth seeing once but not multiple times. 7/10",7,0,2,9 May 2011
The Fountain," You have to have some HEART to enjoy this film
","I vacillated on whether or not to see this film. I read lots of reviews and synopses; then I decided to see for myself. I like it. I think you have to be a person who deals with death a lot to understand this film, I do and I did, right from the start. It is visually beautiful but it also make s a good point. Yes it seem overly dramatic like something you'd find of Lifetime or the Hallmark channel, kind of a 'Touched By An Angel' episode without the angels. I liked the multi-layered storyline, even though it really wasn't multi-layered, it was the same story told through two other points of view. I thought the acting was superb and the beauty was in the quiet and yes predictable ending. But so what even a predictable movie can be good.",7,1,3,7 December 2006
War of the Worlds," Shame on Spielberg
","I rented this movie because my local video store sent me a 99 cent coupon and I knew that was all it was worth. I was right. Spielberg should be ashame that he attached his name to this junk. The screenwriter should be drawn and quartered, tarred and feathered and then burned at the stake. Too harsh, well we laughed through the first hour as stupid people stood around while others were being disintegrate. Then we cringed ourselves as Dakota Fanning just kept screaming. Then we just wanted to shut them all up. At the end we sat in disbelief when a character thought dead shows up miraculously. What major ridiculous junk.",1,8,16,22 January 2006
There Will Be Blood," And the point was?
","I am somewhat a fan of Daniel Day Lewis, even though I only liked him in Last of the Mohicans, so I went into this movie with a certain set of reservations. I didn't mind the lack of dialog in the first half because the story told itself very well. But as I watched more and more I got a funny feeling. And then at the end I knew what it was. Though riveting to watch from a visual perspective this movie is empty. I kept waiting for something important to happen between the major characters, something really revealing, something worthy of an Oscar winning performance...but it didn't happen. Beside that fact the music was more than annoying. 5/10",5,3,8,18 April 2008
Man on Fire," Meaningless stylized violence
","I love Denzel Washington but I really disliked this movie. First and foremost all of the camera movement gave me a headache and made the story too fragmented. That type of choppy cinematography was okay in Traffic but it didn't help here. Seems they were so busy moving the camera around they forgot about building up a relationship between the characters. The story was easy enough to guess about well before things happened and some of the actors are truly wasted i.e. Mickey Rourke and Marc Anthony who I thought did a good job with a very limited part. Christopher Walken just seemed to be window dressing and hello but who was the true villain, everyone? Too depressing for my taste the poor child is saved for what?. Her family is destroyed. Her new friend is gone. Nice try but no cigar.",5,1,2,15 September 2004
The Last King of Scotland," Good Movie in General
","I went to this movie specifically to see the performance of Forrest Whitaker and came away liking all of the other performances too. Forrest did a fantastic job playing Idi Amin. He captured his mannerisms and personality to a tea. The young doctor was very good too and his character of course is written in such a way that you dislike him but grow to feel sorry for him as the movie progresses. I personally thought that Gillian Anderson and Kerry Washington were mostly wasted in this movie with the same macho, male silliness that is always prescribed to women in these movies. They don't just fall into bed with the first man that is nice to them and I wish Hollywood would start recognizing that it turns the female audience off immediately. The violence was a little excessive, everyone know that Amin regimen killed people and it would have been nice if they had focused more on what made the man.",8,2,3,22 January 2007
August Rush," Tries to hard to tug on the heart but not the soul
","This movie should have been one that got into your soul; something like Mr. Holland's Opus. But instead it tries too hard to tug on your heart. The main characters motivations aren't well explained so though you like these two young people you don't connect with them. The same thing could be said for August/Evan. The only truly well explored characters are minor ie Wizard and Arthur. At least you understand and appreciate their motivation. Also the movie leaves you weepy but empty. Music should move your soul and it doesn't. The music is melodic but weak; I can't remember a single song. Also music should be transforming to the people that it touches and the movie doesn't show this transformation for Wizard and it is a missed opportunity. In his soul he is a musician who can't play music, a sad creature praying on others because the music inside him is gone. August the prodigy should have been able to make him hear it again. 6/10",6,1,2,25 March 2008
Hancock," Good beginning and premise and then, disaster
","I love Will Smith. I love Charlize Theron and Justin Bateman as actors. But this movie left me so cold I didn't wait till the extras after the credits cause I'd had enough. This movie is typical of all the recent Hollywood movies...it suffers from bad writing. Hancock has an excellent premise, antisuperhero who doesn't know what to do with the fact that he has been given special abilities. In most of the other superhero stories some mentor helps the hero learn who he is, but in this movie it's an Ad man, which is kind of cute. Will Smith does a great job as the antihero so what's the problem. The problem is the unimaginative writing that ruins a good experience by writing in some ridiculous relationship and back story for the characters. My god I just wanted to walk out when this whole stupid story emerged. But I suffered through till the end hoping something better would come of the mistake...that they would take if somewhere wonderful, but of course it didn't happen and I was left mad, empty and knowing that there would be a sequel.",5,3,6,3 July 2008
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Jackson has made a Star Wars I-III
","It's sad to see Hobbiton go out like this but I never really had high hopes for the movie of this beloved children's, and I emphasis children's, story. Why? Because Jackson apparently didn't understand the difference between the Hobbit and the LOTR's trilogy. The Hobbit is a lighter book, a grand adventure of a little man going out into the world for the first time. It is also the story of a King trapped in the mistakes of his ancestors. The LOTR was a massive tale of friendship, loyalty, royalty, failure and triumph which needed to be told over a series of books. The Hobbit was not that kind of story and so the movie just seems overstuffed, fabricated from multiple other sources, long and boring. Too much fighting, not enough about characters that we're supposed to care about, bad writing overall and even worse score. Beside the song from the first movie there is no decent music at all. I was just amazed at how awful the score really was even compared to other movies. I gave it 2/10 and those two stars are for Freeman's performance as Bilbo and the Ian McKellen who is always good. They were the only two who tried their darn est to rise above this grotesque material.",2,31,59,19 December 2014
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Boring and painful
","I do not have words to describe how painful was to watch this movie. I admire Lucas for his innovation and I pity a man with such tremendously imaginative technical talents who cannot but two good words of dialog or story together. It's ashame that everyone with rush to see this movie (kind of reminds me of the the second two Matrix movies, lots of money spent before we all realized how truly bad they were compared to the original). I think the real problem with these prequels is that Lucas didn't allow the story to take him somewhere he had it two laid out beforehand. Any good writer will tell you that most of the time it's not good to have too much of your story already laid out that leaves your characters nothing to do and no surprises for the reader. The characters tell the good stories and guide the writer to good plot and dialog. We still do not have any good characters in any of theses three movies including ObiWan and Yoda. Even the even Emperor is reduced to a single note. And poor Christopher Lee if he thought he got the shaft in ROTK boy was he in for a big letdown in this movie. At least Peter Jackson let him die with dignity in the ROTKEE, with Lucas he had no chance. I have to admit that I haven't liked any of the prequels. I hated EpI, I tolerated II and I really hate this one. When my daughter leaned over and suggested we walk out I knew that I wasn't just being biased. My husband thought the problem was the love interest interfered with the story but then Jedi had a love interest that didn't internee. Poor Natalie such a good actress reduced to support and crying scenes but Lucas painted himself if a corner with her overt pregnancy though with a little imagination he could have done better by her. And finally for the assertion that this would be 'Titanic in space', he was right, it's a real disaster from beginning to end. No emotion (and I have extremely emotional). Yes I wanted to cry, from anger at my wasted money and sore butt. Sorry James Earl they ruined Drth Vader the moment his mask came off in EpVI and we saw what a whinny man he was. 1/10",1,21,43,22 May 2005
Ray," Incomplete story
","Though filled with great performances especially from Jamie Foxx and Regina King, Ray is an incomplete movie. It would have been nice if the director had added an epilogue so that we could understand a little more about what he his ex-girlfriend overdosed. The music was good and the movie really captures the infectious nature of Ray Charles' music. I especially like the way they did 'What I say'. My husband immediately wanted to know if there was going to be a soundtrack. Foxx also did a good job with the piano playing(whether he was really playing or not wasn't even important), you believe it. Overall an interesting story but could have been better.",7,0,2,1 November 2004
Inception," Interesting but it could have been better
","Like everyone else I was expecting a lot from Inception. I was a great fan of Dark City and the Matrix and felt that this movie would have the same flavor. In some ways it did and in some it didn't. The beginning is fast paced and sets up the characters well. You care some about Cobb but I just couldn't start feeling that this was just a rehash of DiCarpio's 'Shutter Island' as far as the plot was concerned. All of the acting is first rate but the story just doesn't engage you and you really don't care what is dream and what is reality in the end. And the middle of this movie is so slow that both my husband and I fell asleep, now that's shameful for a film that suppose to be intelligent and get into your mind. Again Hollywood has not lack of special effects but they are devoid of story once again. I think that Pixar seems to be the only ones who really look closely at the story before they do all the extras.",7,3,8,20 July 2010
The Secret Life of Pets," Pretty looking film but not the best story
","My daughter was looking forward to PETS as she just go herself a new rescue dog. I thought it might be fun too; it was a little. The animation was great as usual. You really got the sense that these were real live creatures. The initial storyline was a little slow to get started and when it did I thought I was watching a remake of Toy Story 2. A lot was borrowed from other things; so much for originality. The voices were okay for the characters I especially enjoyed Khloe the cat. What I really didn't care for was the villain of the film. There was some development of his character but he was just a loud talking, annoying character. Of course the human were all but window dressing and that's too bad, a little more human interaction might have helped this film.",6,1,4,11 July 2016
WALL·E," Looks good but no Incredibles
","Don't get me wrong WALL-E was a good movie, but it wasn't on the same level as The Incredibles or Toy Story/Toy Story2. The story centering around this lonely robot was cute but not the kind of thing that would keep a kid enthralled long enough to sit through it. I also take issues with the humans in the story; they were a little over the top 'stupid'. I don't think we are mindless as robots content to do the same thing as someone else. We are too individual to just follow the leader. The animation was gorgeous but no better than any of the other Pixar films. The images of Earth really were no as mesmerizing as the critics seemed to think they were. So a good effort but not great. Waiting for the Incredibles 2 and more Edna Moes.",7,3,11,3 July 2008
The Good Shepherd," Could have been very interesting if it had been more focused
",The Good Shephard could have been more interesting if it had focused more on the relationship between fathers and sons. This movie by Robert DeNiro was trying to be a historical account of the CIA inception which is nice but not exactly the kind of subject to keep people interested for almost three hours. My husband I think was really disappointed when nothing blew up every five minutes and I tried to tell him before we went to the theater that this movie was not Spygames or James Bond. It was interesting and Matt Damon's character was nice to follow but it would have been better is they had cut out the husband-wife ridiculousness and concentrated more on the father and son relationship. In fact it should have focused on all the father and son relationships as more of the Lilly White Men in the movie were following after their fathers.,6,2,4,4 January 2007
Rango," Kinda funny, but ultimately too slow to be enjoyable
",Saw Rango tonight and I was really expecting a lot more than I got. The film to me is not for kids and I know some others have said the same thing. Too many of the funny parts would just go over their heads. I also agree with others that some of the characters are really scary and weird. I guess that was good for the filmmakers as it brought people end just to see what the movie was like. Ultimately though it was predictable and really kind of slow. I found myself moving around in my seat hoping that it would be over soon. Johnny Depp voiced his usual recent characterization and I have to be honest I getting a little tired of it. He'd better switch gears quick after the next pirates cause I think everyone else is getting tired of it too. He needs another movie like 'From Hell' in which he was really good.,5,6,15,14 March 2011
Prometheus," Nice looking film with a stupid story
","I'm not really a horror movie fan but I am a SciFi fan. I personally think that aliens is more SciFi than horror. I liked Alien and Aliens, but number three just was dumb and unfortunately this prequel follows suit. Let me start with the good. The movie is visually very nice looking and it starts with a Moon like isolation of David(Fassbender) which is brilliant. The next character is also strong, Charlize Theron; she has really kicked ass as far as acting this summer. Then they start to wake up everyone else and the movie takes a dive that it never recovers from. Not only do really smart people do dumb things in this movie but some of the dialog, especially some of Iris Elba's lines are just poorly written. Durting the film I wanted to like Noomi Rapace's character but I just couldn't and her partner Logan Marshall Green was such a jerk that it was really hard to root for him. The rest of the cast were generic again this really hurts the film.Now I have to say I was a fan of the original Lost all the way up until it became the John Locke show and this movie suffers from the same tunnel vision that the ending episodes of Lost suffers from. Its hard to go somewhere when you've given yourself no where to go. Prometheus quickly reveals itself to have no where to go and yet sets itself up for a sequel. We can only hope that someone else takes over the story.",5,3,7,10 June 2012
Wonder Woman," Could have been a lot better
","Though DC has the best superheroes, they seemed to be having a really hard time presenting good characters and stories for their live action movies, and its really too bad that wonder woman is no exception. I was really looking forward to this movie and after stellar reviews I really thought I would enjoy it. Sadly I didn't. Like Man of Steel, the opening is done well. But once Steve Trevor reaches Paradise island it all goes to pot. Everything they tried to keep 'secret' was telegraphed from the beginning and the silly story-line just made me mad. In Batman versus Superman, Gadot was the only shining light. She was again the point of interest in this story with Chris Pine's doing a good job. The Amazons were great characters. But one character proved totally out of place for his role in the film. The special effects were kind of sucky with everything looking fake. With all its stellar reviews, the audience was silent after the movie was over and everyone rushed for the exits; that's not a good sign. I know the film will make money but DC will continue to follow Marvel instead of leading.",5,8,24,4 June 2017
X-Men: First Class," Quite boring
","I am really surprised that so many people liked this movie. I found it quite boring. Maybe they thought it was a good idea to cast Kevin Bacon as a psycho ex Nazi mutant scientist but I think it was really, really a bad idea. The two leads were okay but for the most part the story was just so, so and really didn't help define the characters at all. In fact some of Erik (ultimately Magneto's) actions are inconsistent to what he should have done with all of his power. Again the character of Charles Xavier is a weakling who is way too emotional about his friends to be effective as a leader. The comic book Xavier has always been better than anything they have put on screen, small or large.",4,7,13,25 September 2011
The Wolverine," Ridiculously boring
","If you read the critics you would think that this Wolverine movie was better than the last; well they're wrong. I had high hopes after reading mostly positive reviews but after actually watching the movie I have to say that it was ridiculously boring. I am so tired of superhero movies that go from one fight scene to the next without any explanation, character or plot development. This movie suffered greatly from overkill with fighting. Also this movie suffers from confusing female characters. Mariko who we are suppose to like comes off as annoying. The Viper comes off as creepy. The only good female character is Yukio who steals the movie from wolverine every time they appear together. The plot was thin and any ending surprises projected themselves almost from the beginning of the movie. Poor Hugh Jackman, poor wolverine.",5,14,29,2 August 2013
The Dark Knight Rises," Long, preachy, predictable and dumb.
","I didn't have high expectations for this movie. I thought they should have stopped after The Dark Knight. This movie is longer than it needed to be. The dialog was preachy, long ridiculous speeches about nothing. It was predictable for anyone who knows the Batman story and parts of it were really dumb. I hate movies about people who are supposed to be smart and then have them do really dumb things. There were some standout characters: Gordon, Blake. I would say Bane but the length of the movie hurt his character has his pontificating became boring. Both female characters were disposal even the one who sparks the so called surprise ending (which by the way was not a surprise). I really didn't like Anne Hathaway as Selena Kyle. She as so little sex appeal. Sure the gadgets were kind of cool but again I hate that they didn't use the sleeker designs in this movie. The music also hurt the film; it was terrible.As a side note, Christian Bale is just not old enough nor does he have screen presence enough to play this more mature Batman or Bruce Wayne that was a problem for me in the Dark Knight. He was a good starting character in Batman Begins but he just doesn't have a good Batman physique or manner to play this character older. So while everyone else is drooling over this film I'm saying mediocre at best.",5,3,10,28 July 2012
Black Panther," Wonderful film
","I was waiting with great anticipation for this film and it was not disappointing. Though some of the dialog wasn't the greatest and there were some missed opportunities to do more The Black Panther lived up to its hype. It was great to see so many black actors doing a stellar job in this film. Chadwick Boseman and Michael Jordan are terrific. It was great to see Sterling Brown, even in a minor role. But the women were the standouts, sorry guys; it is great to see so many film coming out with strong women characters. Watching them was the most fun I'd had at a movie for a while. I hope to see more of them in the future.",8,7,20,24 February 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The death of DC, too bad
","I went to this movie with very low expectations and got exactly what I thought. You know what was so great about the LOTR's? Well it was Peter Jackson loving the story and the characters, his ability to bring that story, not some random piece of the trilogy, to life. This is the failure of DC. Unlike their success on TV they continue to let movie makers who don't care about their heroes make their films. They continue to let people make movies about a broody Batman who wasn't so brooding in the comics or Justice league cartoons (some of the best stories and animation of all time). They had a pretty good Superman until the end of his first movie and I wont' say anything about the ending of this travesty. The others (Green lantern, this upcoming dumb suicide squad) they're just going to ruin outright. So let me just go through why its too bad that DC will never make it to the heights of Marvel. Too many villains who are nothing like their personas in the comics, too much Lois Lane, too much silly dialog, too fragmented, too much unwarranted destruction, too little sticking to the stories that people know really well. Even the music was bad. I have been waiting for DC to learn what Marvel learned but I guess not. So Marvel will continue to thrive by not insulting the audiences' intelligence or love for superheroes. They will continue to thrive by making their heroes interesting and well more human which is what we have always looked for in our heroes.",1,7,16,27 March 2016
Casino Royale," Bond is Bond, same formula different guy, same results-fun
","After seeing the first trailers I knew that all of the nay-sayers would be silenced soon. Craig is just as good as Bond as all of the rest. Everyone is comparing this Bond version to Batman Begins but I think not. Yes it might be a little of a Connery like reversal but it's still the same old Bond. Same formula, same ugly bad guy, same angry boss (even if she is a woman; which kind of like). But that's good cause the Bond movies are always lots of fun, this one included. Some of the chase scenes were way over the top. Also if you know the Bond formula you know what's going to happen before it ever happens especially with the girl. Though there was one scene that I wasn't expecting. Poor Jeffrey Wright was totally wasted. I kept wondering the whole time what he was doing in this movie. I'm still wondering. They could have gotten any Joe Blow to play Felix. Good, no great actors such as he should have been given a lot better part. I hope he didn't sign up for three films like Craig, but if he did, he seriously needs to talk to the writer about something better for Felix next time. If this is the beginning of Bond at least we know they can't kill Felix off in the other two movies.",8,0,2,17 November 2006
Thor: The Dark World," suffers from superhero saturation
","I was hoping that the second installment of Thor might be memorable, well it wasn't. This movie(and all of the rest of the Marvel trailers I saw) suffers from superhero saturation. Let's just face it how many times can an alien being destroy a city, put the hero and his friends in jeopardy before you just get tired. This is the problem with Thor, you just get tired while watching it. Thor just isn't drawn in this installment interesting enough. He was a great fish out of water in the first movie, a egoist brought down by kindness and guilt. In this movie he's just sad and mopey. It doesn't help that his lady love is silly and not very supportive. Jane Foster is window dressing instead of partner. Yes Loki steals the scenes, but in the end it's all for nothing but another chance to do it all again.",6,2,4,11 November 2013
Lucy," Good start but predictable ending
","Lucy is equivalent to lawnmower man for females. This movie starts out well with Scarlett Johannson showing her chops again as a female superhero. Most of the plot defies explanation and most of the rest of the cast are just there for window dressing. This movie has some interesting visuals, especially in the beginning and throughout most of the movie. Then the mayhem starts and guns and blood start flying and any sense of plot just goes by the wayside. In the end we get what we expect and leave scratching our heads and laughing about the hour we wasted watching this movie. With a little more imagination and writing ability this might have been an interesting and visually stunning movie.",6,0,7,29 July 2014
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," Trite and redundant
","Well I really didn't expect much when I saw that they were going to try and make another Star Wars and I didn't get much. This movie is trite and redundant. You know there is definitely room in movies made from previous films for references to its predecessor but this film just has the same thing happen that happened in the previous films (just bigger)and thinks you won't notice. Finn is a terrible character. You don't know why he does what he does and he really has no reason at all to be in the movie except to be annoying. Ray would have been an interesting character if you knew more about her from the beginning. And who is God's name came up with the villains in this movie. At first when I saw the big bad I thought I was in a Marvel film and not Star Wars, come on people. And the Darth Vader substitute is just some whiny boy in black clothes. This movie has the worse dialog that I have ever heard. Listening to Harrison Ford speak became almost painful and Carrie Fisher was worse. When the movie was over my daughter asked me where the real Star Wars characters were? I was asking the same question.",5,17,25,20 December 2015
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Better than the first and a lot less violent
",I went to see the first Hunger Games and though I liked the character of Katniss I was really put off by the excessive violence (especially concerning children) in the movie. I am glad that this continuation of the tale toned some of the violence down and was mostly about grown ups which probably made it more interesting to me. I like the continued political overtones but in this movie I liked Katniss less and felt that everyone else around her seemed more noble than she would ever be. That's kind of bad for a so called heroine. Woody Harrelson was great again and Donald Sutherland always plays evil well. Josh Hutherson excels in the role of Peeta and is as much a focal point of the movie as Katniss. I really don't understand the continued focus of Katniss and Gale's relationship; someone will have to explain that one to me. Though I'm not waiting with baited breath for the next installment I will probably stick with it till the end.,7,2,15,28 November 2013
Looper," Dumb and excessively violent
",I love SF and time travel movies and I like Bruce Willis so I thought this might be a good movie to catch. Boy was I wrong. This movie is dumb from beginning to ending. It has no redeeming characters to attach yourself too and it is excessively violent especially toward young children. I find it hard to believe that critics and others liked this ridiculous premise of a film. I wanted to get up and leave but I was half hoping that the movie would get better or at least amount to something in the end. Sadly it just continued on with needless exposition and a ridiculously predictable ending. I wish I had my 1hr and 58 minutes back.,3,7,18,21 October 2012
300," Undone by Arrogance
","Well I knew going in to 300 that I was probably going to dislike it. I disliked Sin City. I went because I do like comic books but the guess the violence on the page just isn't as visceral as the violence translated to screen. On screen it just seems ridiculous especially when their is no story behind it. Comic books are one thing; they're short the narrator and the characters tell their story through pictures. For some reason the directors and producers of these movies just can't seem to translate that storytelling of the characters to the big screen. The narration on screen just falls flat. The whole time I was watching the movie I had to wonder whether David Wenham ever said to the director and the writer, 'you're kidding right, you really expect me to say this!' The narration and well, most of the dialog was laughable. There was too much of what we have seen before. Muted tones, wheat fields, blustering speeches of glory and death done far better in other movies. The arrogance of the King, his political and deformed adversaries plus the filmmakers is the undoing the all of us.The only saving grace of the whole movie was the Queen. If all of the roles had been written as well as her's the film would have been far better.On another note I think that parents should be extremely caution before taking their young male children to this movie. There isn't just violence in it; there is a lot of sexual content(nudity) and expect for the role of the Queen at lack of respect toward women. 1/10",1,48,149,9 March 2007
John Wick: Chapter 2," Pitiful and violent
","Whatever was fun about the first movie is totally lost and forever forgotten in this one. I am okay with a certain amount of 'stylized violence' and but that was not why I enjoyed the first John Wick. I enjoyed the first because it didn't take itself seriously. These types of movies can't afford to be serious, because when they are their terrible. And so it the problem with John Wick Chapter 2, it takes itself way too seriously, including its over the top, ridiculous, crude violence. Such violence just turns everyone off. If I disliked it so much I guess people will wonder why I gave it a '3'. There were a few good moments; mostly when they Reeves stops shooting so much. There also were a few rich characters, Fishburne, Common (a little), Ian Shane, Claudia Berini and Lance Reddick. Wish the rest of the film had been as interesting as they were.",3,14,36,12 February 2017
Sin City," Sometimes sticking too close to the source material hurts
","I like comic books. I think they are beautiful pieces of art but where sticking to the book literally helps some stories i.e. LOTR (and even Peter Jackson new that some creative license was needed) the director of Sin City should have thought more about the possible audience for his film. I stories would have been good just in and of themselves without the naked women, endless violence and voice over. The characters were also interesting but if appealing to a wider audience is a consideration then sticking with the comic book violence and sex is a no, no. This film should as it stands if for seventeen year old boys who can't get real women and play hour after hour of ultra-violent video games. And since I'm not one of those I was disappointed.",6,1,4,3 April 2005
Spectre," Not the best Bond but certainly not the worse
","I still like seeing Daniel Craig as Bond but I think, unless they can think of some other more interesting villain, the formulaic Bond films are coming to their end. This movie from the opening to the close had the same thing happening over and over again. Explanation, flight, fight love scene. The action was okay, the car chase being the best, but the fight scenes just got to be too much. Ralph Fiennes does an admirable job as M but I miss Judy Dench. She and Craig had a chemistry all their own. This Bond does give some shout outs to the past and that was fun. Also gives us some more disposable Bond girls and a villains who weren't at all interesting But for the most part it's forgettable and that's too bad.",8,1,8,8 November 2015
Coach Carter," Good movie with believable characters
","I think that Coach Carter was a good movie for Samuel L. Most of the time he plays the real heavy and it was nice to see him take interest in these 'Richmen' that he was teaching and coaching. My husband thought and I agree that the Coach also learned something from his players. I didn't like the one side story, the girl and her boy friend. But I did like the way it ended positively. The most compelling story was of course Cruz. The actor who played this role was very good. I was glad his story also ended positively. Though the movie was mostly predictable I still enjoyed watching the characters and the basketball games. Nice movie for young black kids to see.",7,0,0,28 January 2006
Happy Feet," Didn't make my feet happy
",Happy Feet the winner of the Academy award for best animated film didn't make my feet happy. It started cute but soon became very boring. I hope Savion Glover like dancing for the CGI animation but it didn't go over very well since you couldn't really see the penguin's feet. Robin Williams probably had a good time but the longer the movie went the less funny these characters became. Especially when the whole environmental theme kicked in. The movie tried to do too much. They should have stuck to a cute story about accepting each others differences and not veered off into the whole fishing fiasco. I would have like the film better if the dancing and gone on longer and the talking had been shorter. 3/10,3,1,3,28 March 2007
Donnie Darko," Beautiful, engaging, sad and thought provoking
","I was interested in this film after viewing the trailers online. I found it beautiful, engaging, sad and thought provoking. The world of a paranoid schizophrenic teenager who appears to be having insomnia along with nighttime and daytime hallucinations, but is he? Jake Gyllenhall makes this troubled teen into a likable character as soon as he smiles and opens his mouth to speak his first line. We don't know if he's really sick or just really brilliant as he seems to be when he answers his teachers question, and questions them in marvelous fashion. I'm not sure what to make of the ending but maybe there is some heroism or self sacrifice involved, I'm not sure. I'll have to think on it some more or maybe watch the movie again.",8,2,5,18 June 2010
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Pitiful excuse to show off an ugly blonde
","I knew Transformers 3 would be bad as no one had reviewed it in advance. That's always a bad sign. Also all the talk about Megan Fox not being in the movie and Shia shooting his mouth off also was tip off. This movie seems to be an excuse to show off an ugly blonde woman who seems not to know that there is any other color clothing but white and wears inappropriate attire to work. Every time I say Rosie Huntington- Whiteley on the screen all I could think of was Edna Mose and her summation of super models 'stupid little stick figures with poofy lips'. Not only is she ugly but she's the worst actress I have ever seen. She and Shia have absolutely no chemistry but Michael Bay must have been in love with her as he shot so many scenes of just her and her body that it started becoming ridiculous.Let me just say from a females perspective, Megan Fox might not have been great but her character was at least well written and we women appreciated the fact that she could get herself out of trouble without Sam. She didn't slow him down and she sure as hell would never have tried to stop him from saving his best and most trusted friend-Bumble Bee. Just for that he should have kicked Carly to the curb.As far as the plot, well we all know there wasn't one. Just one robot battle scene after another. As far as the humor and annoying characters were concerned, it wasn't as bad as Transformers 2. And these characters weren't half as annoying as the supermodel girlfriend. John Malkovich was wasted. Turturro was his usual. Tudyk and Jeong were funny. I really was disappointed that they used Leonard Nimoy the way they did. Some of the special effects were nice.The whole movie just makes you have to ask yourself what was Steven Spielberg thinking when he saw the finished product, hard to believe that he's sunk this far with his craft.3/10",3,6,15,29 June 2011
The Pursuit of Happyness," Should have been called The Pursuit of the White man
","I knew when I saw trailers for this movie that I didn't really want to see it. But I bought the DVD for my daughter who liked the movie and wanted me to watch it. My the way I an an African American Woman and I think this movie was shameful. I no doubt hope that Chris Gardner is a good man in real life. I hear he still goes to the missions and feeds the poor, I certainly hope that true. Why? Because the business he so pursued is the business of liars and hustlers. That's what the movie portraits a man who lied his way to the top. He was a clown, a kiss butt, a slave to the white men in the office and the good Negro landed the job, rah, rah. I couldn't even applaud his dedication to his son which came off more as selfishness than real love. To love someone is to sometimes let them go. Too bad. I gave it a 5/10 only because Will and Jayden did a bang up job of acting.",5,1,3,1 April 2007
Law Abiding Citizen," Could have been an interesting film
","Law Abiding Citizen could have been an interesting film that asked an important moral question; instead we get a violent, holey mess with a stupid ending. No character is redeeming but the wounded husband and father garners the most sympathy till he starts killing lots of people to make his point (not a spoilers since all of the trailers clearly show this fact). The movie would have been much better if he had put the officials in the corrupt criminal justice system under their own knives instead of just killing them. It had the potential to be a movie similar to Absence of Malice or Runaway Jury. But the story is poor, a perfect example being Foxx's character running around like a cop instead of a prosecuting attorney. You don't see the guys in Law and Order running around the streets catching criminals.",2,4,6,10 July 2010
V for Vendetta," Pitiful piece of film making
","Wow I wish I had seen the same film that the people who gave this an average of 8.3/10 and put it in the top 250 films. I tried to keep an open mind as I sat through the worse action scenes I'd ever seen. I tried to find some redeeming qualities for the poor actors, I like Natalie Portman and Hugo Weaving, who had to spit out the worse duologue I've heard in years. The Brothers Wachowski must have still been taking their psychedelic drugs, you know the ones they were on when they made the second and third Matrix films. This movie suffers from the same types of issues as Aeon Flux, no story or a poorly told story. Even a bad story can be made good by a storyteller who knows how to pull out all of the best elements. Too bad 1/10",1,22,45,28 February 2007
