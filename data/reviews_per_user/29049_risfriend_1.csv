Skyfall," Not a true bond movie, just okay
","This movie doesn't seem to be made with the Bond character in mind. Diverted theme. The only thing seemingly common with Bond saga is the naming of characters and MI6 is British. A bit of 'almost realistic' gadgets are thrown in, don't expect anything fancy, nothing Bond-like. Hell you don't even get some good length of Bond music. Pierce Brosnan was the last known icon for Bond fans. The slick skills of Bond are not there at all. Well, that said, there are a few good action scenes, which save the movie somewhat. If you are looking for more, skip this one. This is just a thriller movie, can't say its not a good thriller, but imprinting Bond's name on the package is false presentation. Lastly, for the next attempt, we need an actor who actually exudes character of Bond, at least the directors so far haven't made Daniel Craig come along like one.",7,2,9,4 November 2012
