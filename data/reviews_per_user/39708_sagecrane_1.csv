United 93," Exceptional realism
","I was very impressed with United 93...it was not at all what I expected; it was like watching a documentary, especially as many of the people in supporting roles were 'real' (non-actor) people, and some had actually been there, (in the Air traffic control rooms etc.) on 9-11. I watched it a second time, with the commentary. Very good. My only criticism, and it is probably one that will cause some irritation, is that in the commentary the director NEVER mentions the very fine actors who played the roles of the terrorists. I would also like to have seen some brief interviews with them in the special features. It would be extremely interesting (to me) to know how they, as actors, and men of Middle Eastern background, felt about the roles, the whole situation, and the movie. I came to IMDb to at least find out their names. Why are they ignored? They did a great job, playing horrific roles. I give them credit, given everything that transpired, it must have taken a lot of courage to take those parts.",9,1,2,13 March 2007
