Skyfall," Best 007 yet
","First, I like to talk about Sam Mendes, he comes to direct the third movie of Bond with Daniel Craig. And let me tell you something, he is great as a director, I never though that Skyfall was going to be that good. Daniel Craig is an awesome actor and so is every one who is in this movie. The script for this movie is so good, it has some connections with the previous movies that are really funny. Skyfall is a well elaborated film, with a lot of suspense in it and it is totally worth watching. It is the best James Bond movie that I have ever seen, and let me tell you that I have seen the previous 22 and this one is the best. Skyfall is a cinematographic jewel and it is just perfect. Congratulations Sam Mendes you did a great job.",10,2,18,2 November 2012
