The Devil's Advocate," cerebral satan movie
","An ambitious young lawyer in an important law firm is mentored by a boss who is more than he appears to be.  Devil film invites comparison to the more current 'End of Days' but is much better. Well acted and scripted, fewer shocks in favor of more suspense and sinister atmosphere.  (Rating: A-minus)",Null,0,0,19 September 2000
The Blair Witch Project," adolescent fare
","Three student documentary film makers are stalked by unseen assailants when they lose their way in a forest.  Very low budget suspense film fails to generate tension due to unsympathetic main characters, paper-thin plot and foul-mouthed script. (Rating: B)",Null,0,1,27 October 2000
Chicken Run," witty, humorous
","A group of desperate chickens on a brutal farm enlist the aid of a visiting rooster to escape.  Claymation movie sends up 50's and 60's escape films but has plenty of original material.  Clever script and plot, non-stop action and remarkable cinematography.  Similar to Toy Story, both adults and kids can enjoy the fun. (Rating: B+)",Null,0,0,15 September 2000
Sleepy Hollow," slick and spooky
","In 1799, an eccentric police constable employs scientific methods to investigate apparently supernatural murders.  Adaptation of Washington Irving story succeeds with quirky, interesting main character, reasonable script and intense atmosphere to distract from pedestrian plot.  (Rating: B+)",Null,0,0,6 November 2000
Catch-22," MASH fans might like this one
","An American bomber pilot in the Second World War tries to avoid flying missions by declaring himself insane. Satirical, anti-war film is filled with absurd characters and subplots blended with serious drama. Heavy handed and overly long but strong character development and stylish direction make it worthwhile. Fans of the Joseph Heller book will be disappointed. (Rating: A-minus)",Null,0,1,22 June 2000
The Killing Fields," mandatory viewing for history film buffs
","A Cambodian translator saves the lives of a group of foreign reporters in Cambodia during the 1975 revolution.  Graphic portrayal of the events leading up to the communist Khymer Rouge revolution and the genocide that followed.  True-to-life performances by actors (one is a Cambodian who escaped the prison camps), myriad historical details and 'newsreel' style create authentic feel. Similar to 1982 films 'Missing' and 'Year of Living Dangerously' (Rating: A)",Null,2,4,4 July 2000
American Beauty," best picture?
","Well-made look at suburban decay in America.  Middle-aged executive abandons his frustrating job and materialistic wife in a pique of mid-life crisis. Interesting mix of black humor and grim drama, but nothing really new here. (Rating: A-minus)",Null,0,1,16 June 2000
Being John Malkovich," pushing the cinematic envelope
","A man takes a menial job at a mysterious corporation and discovers a means to enter and control the mind of a famous actor.  Bizarre blend of sci-fi, drama, comedy and suspense defies film categorization. (Rating: A)",Null,0,1,21 June 2000
From Dusk Till Dawn," gorefest worth a look
",A pair of criminal brothers hide out in an all-night bar where the employees are not what they appear to be.  Explicitly violent action-horror-comedy film does not take itself too seriously.  Surprising performances from a few of the actors. (Rating: B+),Null,0,0,21 August 2000
The Insider," good potential
","A former employee is threatened by the tobacco industry when he exposes widespread illegal practices to the media.  Fine cast and a story based upon actual events are wasted due to constant, annoying camera jitter; anti-nauseants taken one hour before viewing should help. (Rating: B+)",Null,0,0,19 June 2000
Titanic," great movie for adolescent girls
","Love story with a famous historical backdrop.  An astonishly well-groomed steerage class passenger catches the eye of a beautiful, haughty first class passenger aboard a doomed ocean liner.  Technically excellent film sunk by soap opera script, inane plot and television-quality acting.  But if you're a fifteen-year old girl, who cares?  (Rating: B)",Null,1,2,16 June 2000
Army of Darkness," horrific fun
",Ultra-campy swipe at the dynamation and claymation sword-and-sorcery flicks of the 50's and early 60's.  A self-centered discount store clerk is transported to a nightmarish world of demons and black magic and becomes a reluctant hero.  Stranger-in-a-strange-land theme carried to new limits. (Rating: B+),Null,1,1,16 June 2000
The Green Mile," could be better
",A death row prison guard witnesses miracles that lead him to question the guilt of a prisoner. Similar in directorial style and quality of acting to 'Shawshank Redemption' but marred by hokey 'miracle' subplot. (Rating: A-minus),Null,0,1,21 June 2000
The Shawshank Redemption," well done prison film
","An intelligent, resourceful man survives in a brutal prison during the 1950's and 60's. Emphasis on character development rather than enviroment place this film ahead of others in this genre.  A fine example of the triumph-of-human-spirit-over-adversity theme. (Rating: A)",Null,0,0,19 June 2000
The Matrix," Johnny Mnemonic revisited
","A computer hacker attempts to destroy a seemingly invincible artificial intelligence that is controlling human life.  Potentially intelligent, philosophical plot and some fine supporting acting sunk by comic book script, undeveloped main character and excessive special effects. (Rating: B)",Null,0,0,12 October 2000
Gladiator," uneven
","A general in ancient Rome is betrayed by a corrupt emperor and sent to die in an arena as a gladiator. Potentially good Indomitable Human Spirit film is marred by inconsistent direction, somewhat primitive special effects and holes in the plot. Brisk pacing and decent character development work in its favor.  (Rating B+)",Null,0,0,19 June 2000
