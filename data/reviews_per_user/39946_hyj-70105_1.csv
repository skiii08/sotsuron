Your Name.," A Piece of Art
","But I really came here to ask fans of the story, the animation and the feeling to boycott Jar Jar Abrams' version. As we all know the Hollywood hack remaker was given a contract to make an 'American version' of Your Name.
Please boycott it. Do not watch it. Certainly do not pay to go to the theater to watch it. Send a message.Kimi No Na Wa was emotional and entertaining and the legacy should be preserved.",Null,230,250,24 August 2018
