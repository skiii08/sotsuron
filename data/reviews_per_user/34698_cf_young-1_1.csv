Walk the Line," Awards
","Joaquin Phoenix was robbed at the Academy Awards. If ever an actor deserved an Oscar for best actor, Joaquin was Johnny Cash in this movie. I am saddened he was not awarded the Oscar. Joaquin had the same movements as Johnny Cash that I have seen on television and movies that featured Johnny Cash. Even his expressions were great copies of JC. I am a long time fan of Johnny Cash and this movie was great, one of the best bios of a person that I have ever attended. I understand that most of the script was taken from JC's own autobiography so it must have followed his life pretty closely. Reese was good also in this movie but if she deserved an Oscar so did Joaquin only 20 times more so. He did (as she did) his own singing and playing of the instruments. I just loved the movie and Joaquin.",10,0,1,19 September 2006
