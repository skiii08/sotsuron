Ghost," One of my mother's favorite films!
","My mother frequently has this in her VCR, and I don't blame her. The film has so many things going for it, besides the casting and story. There are so many film themes running here. It is a romance, a murder mystery, a supernatural thriller and a comedy (Whoopi Goldberg's performance as Oda Mae the Fortune Teller is priceless, and well-deserving of her Oscar). Yes, the ending is tear-jerking, but it is done so WELL! I find myself reaching for the Kleenex each time I watch it. Enjoy this film when you need a good cry, along with a happy ending.",Null,1,2,18 August 2001
The Birth of a Nation," Love it or hate it, maybe both.
","The problem about this film is that both sides are right.Yes, it is a historical treasure because it is one of the first long-form motion pictures, and the prototype of the epic format that so many films later incorporated.Yes, it is a piece of unmitigated racism, that glorifies the KKK and depicts blacks as sub-human beasts.Watch it for it's historical value, and be appalled by it's racist content.

Ed Wood," Hollywood's Holy Fool
","A touching look at the life of one of filmdom's most confusing figures. Ed Wood, the man, the struggling film-maker, the transvestite, wanted so dearly to be recognized as a Hollywood film-maker, but his works came out so warped and inferior, that they almost seemed like practical jokes. He spent his later years writing pornographic novels, forgotten by the film industry he had embraced, only to become the Holy Fool of Hollywood after his death.The cast is flawless. Bill Murray's performance as transvestite entertainer Bunny Breckenridge is hysterical, Lisa Marie as the icy Vampira is wonderful, but it's Martin Landau's Oscar winning performance as the near-forgotten Bela Lugosi that brings the film it's dramatic and tragic nuances (Many say that Landau earned Lugosi his Oscar by proxy).The scenes with Wood and his entourage are to be cherished. The riot that happens at the premier of 'Bride of the Monster' leaves the party running for their lives. They escape in a taxi, literally at the last possible second, as the mob of unruly teenagers nearly overtake them. Lugosi comments, 'Now THAT was a premier!' Priceless! This is recommended to be watched before seeing 'Plan Nine From Outer Space'. You'll swear the same actors are in both films!An odd yet touching tribute to an odd film-maker, and a sign that despite all the negative press and cold shoulders he received in his life, Ed Wood has finally been justified and venerated.",Null,0,0,13 December 2000
The Iron Giant," The 'Citizen Kane' of animated features?
","Warner Brothers was trying to cut it's 1999 losses from the monumental flop 'Wild Wild West', and ended up putting very little money in the promotion of what may be one of the finest animated features ever made.This is a tragedy, since the film has so much to provide. It is insightful, touching, whimsical, and nostalgic. And there isn't a single musical song-and-dance number or annoying sidekick in sight. The perfect film for the family, including the adults. The kids will associate with young Hogarth, especially if they feel they don't fit in. The adults will appreciate the touches of nostalgia for the 1950's and early 1960's.
The animation is top quality. A brilliant fusion of cel and CGI creating a sense of realism and depth that you don't expect from a cartoon. The vocal performances, especially from Harry Connick, Jr., are flawless.My only complaints are the anti-hunting/anti-gun message and the slightly sweet ending that seemed to be written as an obligation. But these can be overlooked when the quality of the work is taken into consideration.Many say that Orson Welles' 'Citizen Kane' is the finest American film ever made, but it struggled at the box office, and wasn't appreciated for it's genius until many years later. I strongly feel that 'The Iron Giant' will follow the same path. Years from now, this will be the standard that animated features will be judged by. I can only hope that the support of this film on video this will spark a new interest in animation as a serious media, as 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit?' spawned a new interest in animation in general. There are a great number of serious animated features produced in Japan, and there is no reason why this cannot happen in the USA.Part fantasy, part morality play, 'The Iron Giant' is a remarkable work. It didn't get a fare shot at the box office, but it may reach it's intended audience on home video. If you're going to buy the VHS copy, get the widescreen edition. Yes, it IS that good!",Null,0,1,27 March 2000
Blade Runner," The standard by which others are measured
","I still remember seeing this film in a dark, dingy cinema in New York City's Manhattan borough. It is a facinating dystopian view of the future, all with a single burning question at the forefront: What makes us human?Ridley Scott's vision of a Los Angeles in 2019 still haunts me. The first time I saw the LA skyline at night driving down Interstate 5, the images of the first frames of this film came to mind, and I nearly wrecked my car!If you have not seen this film yet, watch the 'original' version first, complete with running narrative and happy ending (forget the 'extended version' with gratuitious violence). Then watch (and savor) the letterboxed (widescreen) Director's Cut, and see how a great film was made better. There's less blood and guts, no narration, and, yes, the dream sequence (with the unicorn) plays an important part. Take note as to the origami folding Deckart finds at the end of the film! It answers (as well as asks) many questions that were never mentioned in the original version.The two most impressive moments for me are Leon Kowalsaki (Brion James)'s classic paradox ('Wake up! Time to die!'), and Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)'s death speech. Hauer literally stole the scene (the words 'like tears in rain' were ad-libbed!), and the sylloquy literally moved me to tears. After all these years, and all the times I've seen this film, it still does! All Roy wanted was to be human, and he could only find his humanity in death.To hell with what Leonard Maltin thinks of this film! For me, it ranks with '2001: A Space Odyssey' as one of the most ambitious views of the future without any hype and schlock normally associated with science fiction. Everything has a worn, grimy feel to it, unlike the bright, shiny props in so many films. The colors are unusual. Most of the interior scenes have sepia or tan backgrounds. The camera angles and lighting are incredible, and Harrison Ford's acting is totally believable.The film isn't perfection, but dammit, it reaches out and touches it!(Take note as to how many of the gadgets and themes are now commonplace. Retrofitted buildings, laptop computers, digital video, on-board computers in cars, the heavy influence of Asian pop culture and cuisine in the USA, all in a film made in 1982!)",Null,0,0,5 June 1999
The Producers," Painfully, jaw-dropping-ly hysterical
","Mel Brooks' genius has rarely shown as brightly as it did in this 1968 film that was roasted by the critics, and later won two Oscars and would be lauded for the masterpiece it is.Zero Mostel (in one of his finest comic performances ever) plays a crooked Broadway producer, and Gene Wilder his mousey, high-strung accountant. After going over the books of several plays, they realize the best way to make money is to oversell investment of a play that is destined to flop.The play chosen is a musical comedy entitled 'Springtime For Hitler', written by a wanted Nazi on the run (played over the hilt by Kenneth Mars). The play is cast with the worst possable actors (Dick Shawn, playing a very bad Jim Morrison wanna-be, is cast as Hitler), the worst costumers are hired, and the rest of the play is staffed by the worst talent money can buy.On opening night, the play is so bad (the Busby Berkley-style musical number that opens the play, complete with dancers goose-stepping to form a swastika, is so kitchy as to boggle the mind...and the expressions on the faces of the audience are priceless) that everyone thinks it's a farce...and, horror of horrors, becomes a monumental hit!Now, how do you repay the investors after you've sold 25,000% of the play?There are lines in this film that are priceless, and the film never lowers to the level of slapstick or profanity. Just surreal situations, incredible writing, and a scathing lampoon of the most evil man in history (Mel Brooks deserves accolades for presenting Adolf Hitler, a man who nearly ended civilization, as a half-crazed beatnik).Highly, highly recommended!",Null,1,2,25 May 2000
