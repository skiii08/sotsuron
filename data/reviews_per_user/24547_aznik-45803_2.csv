Black Swan," Jocker's eyes wide whiplash
","It's a pretty perfect mix of Joker (2019), Eyes Wide Shut (1999) and Whiplash (2013).
Are you shocked?
Relax! It's just about my association after watching. I described in detail how each of this movie connects with 'Black Swan' below.1) Eyes Wide Shut (1999)
Oddly enough, I noticed the most connections have with this movie. And it's all about atmosphere. I watched this movie by one shot and it was like a dream. I think it was made on purpose. I saw the world by Inna's (Portman's cast) eyes. Gorgeous filming, impressive editing - this and others tools immerse you to fantastic surreal atmosphere.
But there is another one connection with 'Eyes Wide Shut'. This about atmosphere too. It's a theme of passion and seduce. This film touches a subjects of lust, transcendence and honor for the duration of film.2) Whiplash (2013)
This paragraph is too obvious. Main character of this movie obsessed by her work. You'll know it for first few minutes of film.3) Joker (2019)
The connection between 'Joker' and 'Black Swan' is the main idea of film.
It's the awakening the evil inside yourself.
Look at the title of movie. Why it's called 'Black Swan' while in 'Swan Lake' there are white swans as well?",8,0,0,24 January 2020

3. Logical construction of story and understandable dramatic end.
4. Incredible cast.
5. Car's theme.
6. Cult soundtrack that was created extremely appropriateBut when we add there a portion of art-house we eventually have a cult masterpiece.
Details that took it:1. Brand-new type of main character (mix of Taxi Driver, Rambo, Terminator and Forest Gump)
2. Unique and unrepeatable style of filming, editing and graphic design.
3. Probably the best neo-noir film in 21 fox.I think the last paragraph is the main secret of success. It's the first neo-noir since «Se7en» that all details come together and we took a real cult movie.",8,0,1,26 January 2020
