The Incredible Hulk," Underrated
",Overall I think this an underrated MCU movie. Hulks transformation is done really well and the storyline that you follow is quite interesting. I also think the third act is awesome as you get to see two big monsters (Hulk and Abomination) battle it out!,8,0,0,7 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Good
",The first film in the prequel trilogy is good overall but has some flaws. On the good side of things it's cool to see Obi Wan being trained by Qui Gon as they both have great characters. Darth Maul is a really cool villain and the end fight scene is awesome! On the down side of things Anakin and Jar Jar are pretty annoying and distracting which really takes away from the movie.,7,0,0,6 July 2020
Iron Man 3," Solid end to the trilogy
",Iron Man 3 is a very controversial end to the Iron Man trilogy. There is good action in this film and I find the storyline with Tony struggling with PTSD interesting. I don't really care for the twist in the film but I don't hate it! I think Iron Man 3 is a solid end to a solid trilogy!,8,0,0,28 June 2020
John Wick," Very good highly recommend!
",Keanu Reeves stars in a brilliant action film! The concept of the movie may seem weird on paper but this film totally delivered. Making the story of John Wick (Keanu Reeves) getting revenge on the people that killed his dog and stole his car worked great and the action sequences were very satisfying making for a very good movie.,9,0,0,6 June 2020
Iron Man 2," Worst Mcu movie in my opinion but still good
",Overall rating 6.9/10. Iron Man 2 is the worst Mcu film for me but still isn't that bad. It's cool to see Iron Man back in action as well as the cool addition of Black Widow. There's some pretty good fight scenes and the acting is good as well. On the downside of things Whiplash is a weak villain and the film has way to many plot lines making the film feeling overstuffed. Overall Iron Man 2 is a pretty good film but has it's problems.,7,0,0,26 June 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Fun Movie
",This is a really fun movie! The original is just a little bit better but this movie is close. There is lots of great action and comedy and it's nice to see the return of characters that you may not expect to come back. I highly recommend this sequel as it surpasses expectations!,8,0,0,22 June 2020
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Good
",This is a good movie overall. There is a pretty intriguing story with some pretty good visuals and likeable characters. Personally I thought it was a little long but other than that the first Narnia remains a fun one.,7,0,0,1 July 2020
Spider-Man 2," A sequel better than its predecessor
",I think the second Spider-Man is better than the first one. It takes the characters and develops them more bringing good plot lines and brings the diabolical Doctor Octopus to the big screen in a great performance. It has really awesome action sequences like the one on the train. Overall this is a solid entry in the Sam Raimi Spider-Man trilogy.,9,0,0,6 June 2020
Aquaman," Jason Mamoa is cool but the most of the film is dull.
","Jason Mamoa does a really good job of playing Aquaman in this film but there isn't much else that's really that great about this movie. This movie relies on CGI way to much and lots of the movie is cheesy, boring and dull. The movie gets points for the 3rd act but overall this is another forgettable DCEU film.",6,0,7,6 June 2020
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Solid Movie
",This is a pretty solid and action packed film! Davy Jones returns as a solid villain and Johnny Depp returns in his fantastic role as Captain Jack Sparrow. This film improves with the CGI and there is many good action scenes but the movie does feel a little to long.,8,0,0,22 June 2020
X-Men," A good film
",X-Men is one of the first good superhero films in my opinion. I really enjoy the characters and storyline in this movie. Hugh Jackman is the perfect actor for the Wolverine and his performance was top notch. I liked how the film incorporated the Brotherhood led by Magneto as the main villains of the film. The film may not have aged the best with some of the effects compared to today's superhero films but the original X-Men movie remains one of the most rewatchable superhero movies!,7,1,1,6 June 2020
Spider-Man 3," Entertaining
",Overall this is a very entertaining Spider-Man film with some good action sequences. Out of the first 3 movies in Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy this one has the best visuals. I don't mind the villains in this film. This film does get cheesy at times and Emo Peter Parker certainly does not work.,8,0,0,6 June 2020
Ready Player One," Ready Player One
",I don't really have much to say about this film. I think the idea is really cool and some of the scenes work well like the Shining one. But I think overall this film drags a lot and is boring some of the time making it not as rewatchable.,6,0,0,26 June 2020
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Amazing
",Spider-Man Homecoming is a refreshing Mcu film. It's very fun and lighthearted with great characters and entertaining scenes. The action sequences are very good and the movie knows when to be goofy and when not to be.,10,0,0,6 June 2020
Fast & Furious 6," Cool Movie
",This is a pretty good Furious entry. There is some good action sequences and characters. This film also has some really cool cars like the other films but I don't find Furious 6 as enjoyable and rewatchable as some of the other films.,7,0,0,6 June 2020
Suicide Squad," Just a mess
",Suicide Squad is a huge missed opportunity! The film seems to only focus on Harley and Deadshot while the other characters are just there in the background. The plot is very messy and some of the characters choices are kinda dumb. Enchantress is a terrible villain I don't know her motive or what her powers are. The pacing in this film is not good either. On the plus side of things Deadshot and Harley are good characters but other than that Suicide Squad has nothing else going for it.,4,0,0,25 June 2020
Doctor Strange," Visually Stunning
",This is one of the best MCU movies visually in my opinion. I really enjoyed Benedict Cumberbatch as Doctor Strange and thought the movies plot worked well. The villain was a little forgettable but overall this is a soldi entry in the MCU,9,0,0,6 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Disappointed
",This isn't that bad of a movie it's just disappointing. The story seems a little out of place and lots of the characters choices don't seem like something they'd actually do! Aside from the problems you still get good emotional Star Wars scenes and some really good battles making for a disappointing final movie with some good sequences!,7,0,7,7 June 2020
Ant-Man," Fun film
",The MCU delivered another great movie with Ant-Man. I love the origin story behind Ant-Man and how they told it in this movie was awesome. It's a really touching lighthearted movie that works really well as a soft entry in the MCU. Add to that the final battle with the toys was a genius idea making for an awesome movie!,9,0,0,7 June 2020
Justice League," Bland
",Justice League is a pretty bland and forgettable film. The plot was weak and the villain is boring. The good parts of the film come with the action scenes which aren't bad and seeing all of the heroes is nice but there isn't much else going for the movie. The Avengers is the much better superhero team up movie that I'd watch over Justice League any day.,6,0,0,7 June 2020
Spider-Man," Good Movie
",This is a very enjoyable comic book movie. As one of the first comic book movies Spider-Man forms a film showing what comic book movies should look like. It has good characters and performances and formulates a solid villain as the Green Goblin,8,0,0,6 June 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man," Good Movie
",I actually really like this Spider-Man film. I like the serious tone of this film and really enjoy Lizard as the villain. The casting for Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) and Gwen Stacey (Emma Stone) is perfect making for a solid Spider-Man reboot.,8,0,0,6 June 2020
The Fast and the Furious," It's fun
",The Fast and the furious is a good start which would turn into a long running franchise. It introduces cool characters sweet cars and a plot that works. It's a small scale film but it sure has some very fun car sequences and classy early 2000s cheesey scenes.,7,0,0,6 June 2020
Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them," I debated to give this movie a 7 or 8
",Overall this is a pretty good movie returning to the magic world that Harry Potter brought us. I enjoy the new characters and their performances quite a lot but the film comes with problems to. My problem with this film is how uneven the storyline is and it doesn't know what it wants to be. One moment of the film will be focusing on the cute fantastic beasts but then the film switches tones to talk about child abuse. Overall it's an enjoyable film with problematic storytelling.,7,0,0,6 June 2020
Aladdin," Will Smith is awesome!
",This whole movie is pretty fun for me. The music is performed well and the adventure is interesting but who really stole the show was Will Smith as the genie. He did a wonderful job as he was hilarious energetic and a lot of fun to watch on screen!,8,0,0,7 June 2020
Ghost Rider," It's fun
",Ghost Rider is a pretty cheesy film and the script may not be the best but it is still a fun comic book film! You are captivated enough in the story and the film is never boring making for a pretty decent film!,6,0,0,2 July 2020
X-Men: The Last Stand," Ok but it is entertaining
",The movie itself surely isn't the greatest. The ever expanding brotherhood doesn't work very well with this film. Juggernauts performance is really disappointing comparing him to the comics. There is a lot of cheesy dialogue and some of the characters feel out of place. Although this is a pretty problematic film it's still has some good entertainment with fast paced action sequences and some not bad acting although it comes across as cheesy.,6,1,1,7 June 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," Debated to give it a 6 or a 7
",This is a really strange movie for me. It is a lot less serious than its predecessor which doesn't work for me. There was some interesting sequences like the fight with Green Goblin at the end which turns out to be a very emotional scene and even the other fight scenes work to. I also liked the chemistry between Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone. The plot to me was ok but I'd probably put the villains on the weaker side of the scale making for a not bad sequel to The Amazing Spider-Man duology.,7,0,0,6 June 2020
Transformers," Good Action Film
",Overall the first Transformers film is a pretty good movie. The acting is pretty decent there's a cool concept and seeing robots battle it out is pretty fun. I really don't have anything bad to say or anything great to say about the film. It's just a fun movie to watch!,7,0,0,25 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Debated a 6 or 7
",I was so hyped with this movie and the end result is just good. Some parts drag a just a little and this type of story has been told before but at the end of the day there is some cool ideas and action scenes presented in this movie.,7,1,7,7 June 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy," Favourite MCU film
",I absolutely love this movie. This was one of the MCUs biggest risks yet. Taking a talking raccoon and a tree and pairing them up with a group of misfits seems like a wacky idea but boy did it payoff. The comedy is balanced throughout the movie brilliantly and the acting is top notch. The plot also works really well in this movie. As funny as this movie is it can even get emotional when it needs to be without coming across as goofy. I highly recommend this film for anyone!,10,0,0,7 June 2020
Mission: Impossible II," Nothing Special
",There really isn't anything to good about this movie. Everything just seems ok except for there is some good Tom Cruise action and stunts. The rest of the movie drags a little bit to me.,6,0,1,7 June 2020
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Don't Understand The Hate
","I think Avengers Age of Ultron is a great follow up to the original Avengers. It brings action, story, comedy and a compelling villain. It has everything you want in a superhero movie. I also really like Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver although they ended up wasting Quicksilver's character. I recommend Age of Ultron for any action movie fans!",9,0,0,30 June 2020
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The 5th film delivers!
",This is an awesome movie! The trio of friends is great like usual and very well played! Dolores Umbridge is played very well making you hate her character so much. The third act is emotional and has a great action sequence setting up for bigger plots in the 6th movie,9,1,1,7 June 2020
Mission: Impossible," Good spy film
",This is a classic spy film. There is some really cool stunts and spy action within this movie. I don't think this is the best movie but I sure think it's good!,7,0,0,7 June 2020
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," A Classic
",This movie is truly magical. The world building is fantastic and the characters are very enjoyable. It starts off this incredible movie series really well. The plot works well for the first movie and overall this movie is delightful from start to finish!,9,0,0,6 June 2020
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Solid Entry
",Chamber of secrets is a solid sequel to the first film. It stays true to the novel which isn't a bad thing but is a little bit to long. Aside from that it's a fun movie with good action scenes good character development and an interesting plot.,8,0,0,6 June 2020
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," A decent film
",The second Transformers movie is decent but has its issues. The action scenes were explosive and the film is never boring but some scenes seem a little out of place and just plain out weird. The story has its moments but the romance part of it just dose not work. Revenge of the Fallen does have some really good sequences but also has some weird out of place moments.,6,0,0,26 June 2020
Scream 2," Awesome Sequel
",Scream 2 is an underrated movie in my opinion. There is really good Ghostface sequences and you get to learn more about the main character. This film really keeps you guessing who is behind the acts of Ghostface!,8,0,0,7 June 2020
Scream," Great
",This is the best horror movie for me. This movie is amazing for me. I love the parody aspect of the film and how it doesn't try to be scary. I love the idea of Ghostface and the mystery of who's behind the mask. There is some really cool scenes in this movie making for a really satisfying film.,10,1,1,6 June 2020
Wonder Woman," Good
",This isn't a bad movie at all but it isn't great either. The war plot line is interesting and the first and second acts work really well. I actually find Dr. Poison to also be an interesting villain. I thought Wonder Woman was portrayed pretty well and really liked Steve's performance. Once this movie reaches the third act it kind of falls apart. The final act seems awkward out of place and to mention that Ares is a bad villain. While most of the movie is pretty good where Wonder Woman falters is at its bad third act.,7,3,14,7 June 2020
Shrek," Awesome Film!
",I always get a kick out of Shrek! There is so many hilarious moments for all ages! The plot is really fun with Shrek going to save the princess and all of the characters have really fun moments! The villain is also a pretty fun addition in this film. I really like this movie and recommend for everyone!,9,1,1,26 June 2020
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It's good
",I find this movie good but not great. My main problem with this movie is that it's hard to follow a lot of the time for being a superhero movie. But there is some really good action scenes like the warehouse one and some good character moments.,7,1,2,7 June 2020
X2: X-Men United," X-2
",X-2 is a solid entry in the X-men franchise. It delivers another clever story with good action scenes. I also thought that Stryker and Lady Deathstrike worked really well as unique villains and the addition of Nightcrawler was a nice touch.,7,0,0,7 June 2020
The Purge," Underrated
",This is an underrated movie in my opinion. I get people's issues with the film like the direction they took but after watching the sequels it makes me appreciate this one more. It's a solid home invasion thriller with some creepy moments making for a pretty good entry in the Purge franchise!,7,0,0,6 June 2020
