50 First Dates," hopelessly cute
","Sean Astin and Schnieder steal this film. The movie is cute, Sandler is charming, Barrymore is her normal self, but the role players really bring it. Sandler is known for bringing quirky characters to his movie. This one brings in a bunch of the old actors, and adds several unique characters to the picture. My wife really enjoyed it so I recommend it as a date movie. Laughed outloud about 3 times, far less than Sandlers other movies but this one is rewarding because your hopes get fulfilled. Not as repetitious as Groundhog Day, not as interesting or as intriguing as Memento, not as funny as Happy Gilmore, but definitely worth the time. Rent it, watch it, and forget it, but enjoy it while its happening.",7,0,0,23 July 2004
