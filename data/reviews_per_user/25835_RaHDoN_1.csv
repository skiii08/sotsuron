The Blair Witch Project," Frightfully Delightful! An Epic Ghost Story
","For the Past 2 months I have been waiting to see this film.  I thought that the story behind the movie was outstanding.  The way they set it up with the webpage gave the movie a very real feel.  The acting throughout the entire film was outstanding, not once did it seem that the actors were not actually part of the situation.  As the situation became more complex it drew me to the edge of my seat.  I wasn't spooked entirely until the movie was drawing near to the end.  The ending was incredible.  I will let you find out the ending for yourself.  I had chills for 10 minutes after I left the theater! Even now it still gives me chills thinking about it.  One thing is for sure, I won't go camping for a while!",9,1,1,1 August 1999
