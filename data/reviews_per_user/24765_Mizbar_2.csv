Skyfall," Great Action but less Classic Bond
","Skyfall is definitely an action packed movie.The stunts were amazing and the action shots were fast and thrilling. All actors did a wonderful job. But unfortunately I did not really sense the classic 'BOND' element which one would really expect in a Bond movie. It's more of a character focused movie, venturing into some childhood details of Bond and the relationship with M. It didn't really show any cool Gadgets, and disappointingly, scenarios with the Bond girls were't sexy enough. The Music and technical details were superb. Great Direction. But in a Bond movie, we are used to see some fantasy dreamy silly stuff....i missed that. Overall the movie is a fantastic action movie, I enjoyed it. But it was very easy for me to forget that this was actually a James Bond 007 Movie I was watching.",6,1,4,27 January 2013
Life of Pi," Enchanting Story with Beautiful Visuals
","Ang Lee is a Master story teller. He has succeeded yet again to deliver us with an astounding piece of work. Beautiful story and incredible visual effects and scenery. The cast was wonderful. Life of Pi takes the viewer to a journey of magic and wonder. It also depicts the vivid and colorful world of India especially during the colonial period. I would have wished the script had been a bit better, and honestly speaking there were few moments it felt a bit too dragging...perhaps overly emphasized on emotional acting. This movie could have been totally perfect with a few improvements. However it still is a sensational movie and Ang Lee deserves all the credit and salute!!!",7,2,5,27 January 2013
