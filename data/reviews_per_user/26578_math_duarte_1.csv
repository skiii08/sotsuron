Skyfall," James Bond has evolved
","I think many were expecting to see 'explosive pens', invisible cars, fights in outer space ... Well, that James Bond is dead! And died to birth a Bond more interesting. Today, James Bond returned to being a spy realistic and serious, referring to the good times of Sean Connery (Dr. No, From Russia With Love, Goldfinger and Thunderball) and Timothy Dalton (in his two films), moving away from the stereotype created with Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan (Brosnan even gave us entertaining movies, but without any content). Daniel Craig is James Bond like the books by Ian Fleming. It is a believable hero, not limited to sequences and surreal excesses of jokes and nasty beats. And Craig has, in this film, his best performance as 007, well being stronger on paper. Javier Bardem gives life to the best villain of the franchise and the first conversation between Bond and Silva is to devote himself as one of the best moments of the film. In fact, the entire cast is wonderful. The speeches of Q are spectacular, the participation of M is fantastic and Eve gives a more seasoned in history. The strength of the film comes from the able direction of Sam Mendes who knew very well condense action scenes and dialogs. The film is packed with action scenes without a brain. They happen when it is necessary. The final part of 'Skyfall' is to cause nostalgia to any fan of James Bond. In short: very careful if you want to see this movie! If you watch it expecting a lot of action unnecessary, you will be disappointed greatly. As the Q said in the film, James Bond has evolved!!",9,3,6,19 January 2013
