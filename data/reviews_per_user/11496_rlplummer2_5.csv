The Avengers," A smart, slick, special-effects-stacked, super smash!
","I'm not sure if 'The Avengers' is the best superhero movie ever, but I can't think of one that tops it! Big kudos to director Joss Whedon (screenplay), Zak Penn (script), and the other scribes for writing such an intelligent movie.This film is MUCH more than bad guy wants to beat the good guys and rule the world. The movie expertly weaves together plot elements of recent Marvel movies 'Thor', 'Captain America', and 'Iron Man 2'. I enjoyed how each of the Avengers had scenes that enhanced their characterizations. I appreciated how the tesseract/Cosmic Cube figured into different people's motivations for securing it, so as to do evil or do good. (And not everyone agrees about which is which).The dialogue in 'The Avengers' is excellent. Robert Downey Jr. (Tony Stark/Iron Man) and Tom Hiddleston (Loki) are especially good at delivering their lines.And what's a superhero movie without punches and explosions? The fight sequences are great and the special effects are fantastic! Congrats to the several hundred artists who made cities, landscapes, alien hordes, and the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier look so realistic.I will be seeing 'The Avengers' again at a theater soon, and I'm already looking forward to Marvel Studios making 'Avengers 2'. You don't have to be a genius like Tony Stark to know THAT'S going to happen!",9,2,6,7 May 2012
Unbreakable," A 'Comic Book' Story With Maturity and Suspense
","Do not dismiss 'Unbreakable' as a comic book movie. Director M. Night Shyamalan uses many of the techniques that made 'The Sixth Sense' so successful. Instead of graphic violence and lots of blood, he makes cameras slowly pan around corners or through slightly opened doors. He cleverly uses shadows. And in this film, Shayamalan even uses the same moody lead actor: Bruce Willis! (In one of the DVD's features, Willis says he agreed to make 'Unbreakable' without even knowing what the movie was about). In this fine suspense/mystery, David Dunn (Willis) starts learning and remembering some unusual things about himself after he's involved in a major accident. Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson) is a quirky, brooding stranger who wants David to discover what these revelations mean. I think Jackson enjoys wearing unusual wigs (see 'Pulp Fiction, 'Formula 51/The 51st State', 'Soul Men'). And Elijah Price's hair truly is unique! 'Unbreakable' strikes the right balance in its seriousness while still telling a cool comic-style story. Great acting performances by David's wife Audrey (Robin Wright Penn) and his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). One scene that the family shares in the kitchen is truly harrowing. Willis and Jackson are top-notch as acquaintances/adversaries/allies. And like other Shayamalan movies, what you THINK is going to happen often doesn't. A cool and creepy comic caper. *8 out of 10*",8,0,0,10 November 2009
42," An Inspiring Baseball Movie That Touches All the Bases
","As Jackie Robinson was an excellent, multi-faceted baseball player, '42' is an excellent multi-faceted movie. Writer-director Brian Helgeland manages to artfully mix elements of drama, baseball action, humor and romance[!] while telling an important story about recent American history.I thought it was wise for the film to focus on just a few years of Robinson's career, so that more time could be given to important scenes both on and off the field.'42' is not called the 'Jackie Robinson Story' for a reason. The movie is about more than just one man. The film shows the roles that Brooklyn Dodgers owner Branch Rickey (Harrison Ford), Robinson's wife Rachel (Nicole Beharie), and journalist Wendell Smith (Andre Holland) played in Robinson's career and life. All the actors give fine performances. And Chadwick Boseman is fantastic in portraying Robinson's determination, anxiety, anger, athleticism and courage.I also appreciated the scenes that touched on the cultural climate in the nation. Watch for what happens between a father and his son when Robinson is introduced at a game in Cincinnati.I thoroughly enjoyed '42'. It's a film that that should be a game-winning hit with baseball fans, and those who appreciate civil rights and American history.",9,68,86,12 April 2013
Salt," 'SALT' has spicy action and acting, but the script and writing is bland.
","As a fan of action movies, I found 'SALT' to be quite entertaining. The chase scenes and fight scenes are intricate and exciting. As a fan of good acting, I was impressed by Angelina Jolie, who I think is underrated as an actress because so much attention is focused on her beauty and celebrity status. Her strong and believable presence carries the movie. Kudos also to Liev Schreiber and Chiwetel Ejiofor for making their characters interesting and very believable. Good acting greatly helps me 'buy in' to the story. However, as a fan of good writing, 'SALT' left me somewhat disappointed. I enjoyed the premise of the film and some of the plot twists, but the script is so full of holes, you'd think Evelyn Salt had blasted it with a machine gun! I will not mention any specific plot faults, so as to not spoil the movie for you. In conclusion, 'SALT' earns an '8' for action; an '8' for acting; but only a '5' for writing. That's an average of 7, which makes 'SALT' a tasty action movie worth watching.",7,9,11,4 January 2011
Avatar," Visually groundbreaking with sometimes spotty storytelling
","'Wow!' That's what I first thought just before removing my 3D glasses after having seen 'Avatar'. This film is a feast for the eyes. I know the Navi and their homeland don't really exist, but the special effects make it pretty hard for one to refute it. 'Avatar' reminded me of how I felt after seeing 'Star Wars' back in the Summer of 1977. For better or worse, 'Avatar' will change the way big budget Sci-Fi movies are made from now on.As for the storytelling, that left me with both admiration and confusion. Earthlings want the Navi's 'unobtanium' (what a lame name!), but why do humans need this natural resource so desperately that they're willing to possibly destroy a race of beings to do so? And if you didn't know that 'Avatar' director James Cameron is a super pro-ecology, ultra anti-war guy, then get ready to be hit over the head with his ideology.Fortunately, the acting is quite good. Sam Worthington was excellent portraying Jake Sully. He presented a genuine character arc. Acting kudos also to Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Giovanni Ribisi and Stephen Lang as the hyper-hawkish U.S. colonel.When 'Avatar' is ready to be released on HD Blue Ray disc, that might be the day I finally break down and buy a Blue Ray Player! Will 'Avatar' become the Sci-Fi icon that 'Star Wars' is? I don't know. However, when you're the biggest box office hit in the history of movies, I believe 'The Force' to become a classic is strong with 'Avatar'.",9,3,5,9 March 2010
