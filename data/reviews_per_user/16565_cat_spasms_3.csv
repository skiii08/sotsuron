The Ring," A fascinating, hair-raising movie that most people can enjoy.
","For those who have not seen this movie, I would recommend it. It will be worthwhile and make good entertainment if you watch it late at night...most likely. With that said, I also believe this movie is not meant for everyone who watches it. Some people who I've discussed this movie with hated it, simply because it was too weird for them. The movie is extremely imaginative and fairly surreal, so if you go into the theater expecting the ending to have every single question answered and a solid ending, you'll probably not get what you want. You need to be more open minded than that, and be able to think of it more as an idea or a philosophy than a story. After all, the movie is supposed to be an Urban Legend.Personally, I saw this movie in theaters 2 years ago exactly (on Halloween Night), and had a great time! But for me personally, there was more to the movie than just chills and frights. Rather, for some who may pick up on the ideas the movie presents, it can be quite an experience to see it.I voted for this movie as a 10. Others of you may feel it is a 8, 7, or 6...some may be completely unable to grasp the movie's abstract concepts and would rate it a 2 or 1, calling it a waste of time. However, if you are able to approach this movie at a different angle and can accept it's world, you will be in store for a great adventure!If you liked the movies 'Unbreakable' or 'Kill Bill (both volumes)', and can enjoy horror movies, I think you will love this movie from start to finish.",10,1,1,31 October 2004
The Usual Suspects," An Amazing Production: You'll never see the full ending coming!
","This movie is an American classic in many ways already. I just watched it now from the comfort of my home, and instantly came here to comment. I would call this one of the top 10 American movies made. Ever. Hands down.The movie's plot is the story of 5 ex-criminals, who since having cleaned up some find their selves accused of a crime none of them appear to have committed. They begin to believe that the police simply chose them as scapegoats for the crime, so they would have somebody to accuse. Angered by this and the corruption within the NYPD, they decide to take radical action against the cops. This soon leads them all back into the world of crime, and to the shocking truth: that it wasn't coincidence that made their paths cross, but rather a set up. Their story is told by the one surviving man, Verbal Kint, who is pounded by the police, as they try to find out if he is telling the truth or a pack of lies.There are far too many things to love about this movie. It has got lots of action, an intriguing, winding, mysterious plot, and probably the most shocking ending for any movie I've seen in the last 3 years. The movie also, seemingly like the much more recent Kill Bill, manages to create a world of assassins and crime, a setting that will engross the audience. However, one thing this movie has that other movies don't have is that it makes a point of evil winning. The Usual Suspects appears to be a slap in the face towards the police force in many lights, as it reveals just how they could let a bunch of vicious criminals get away so easily! I would personally recommend this movie to anyone who loves twisted action, yet suspenseful, movies...however, I think anyone who can withstand a good amount of violence in a movie will still enjoy it. And anyone is bound to love this ending, I only knew half of what was going to come, and it still left me shocked!",9,0,2,19 December 2004
Mulholland Drive," Was this film really necessary?
","I watched this movie a while back, and haven't taken the time to comment on it until now.Before I begin my rant, I must say: This movie is a VERY great idea and concept. It had a nice plot and a good amount of potential, but more importantly it did have what I feel was a great concept and way of portraying Hollywood.That was the ONLY reason why I gave this a 6/10...and that was being nice.The movie is so confusing and tries so hard to be something greater and awwing that it ends up a disaster. You could analyze the film for hours, and still not truly 'get' it. People keep on trying to 'get' this movie just because they 'get' the idea. Let me tell you now...just give up.You can look at this movie from a million different angles, perspectives, over-analyze every single detail. It still will only lead you to the main theme about Hollywood, and won't really give you any further insight.When making a movie like this, a point does need to be made, yes. However, at the same time, that point needs to be made clear and concise, not overflowing with randomly inserted scenes that not only remain confusing, but won't contribute to any greater knowledge of the movie's main point. As a result of the telephone sequences, the boss, the homeless man that looks like a monster...all of these scenes present interesting ideas, but it is just redundant and restating it. Not emphasizing, but literally restating it in another way.We don't need 2 hours of reiteration of a main point. We would prefer to have a good movie. I'm not even asking for it to entirely make sense...I'm just asking for it to add something new, something interesting that can be analyzed and gained from.I personally feel that there isn't anything that could be added after the main point that Hollywood is a dream that becomes a nightmare...it could have just been a story of two lesbian actresses, one with amnesia and one who fails in Hollywood, yada yada yada...it could have NOT had the excessive scenes that amount to nothing. Was it all really necessary?Personally, I think not. This movie could have easily been a half hour shorter if it had been edited, but instead it had to be dragged out. It destroys the movie, leaves the viewer confused, and ends up making Lynch's entire point worthless. By the end, we don't CARE what great ideas the movie may present. We just want it to be over so we can go home and go on with our lives as far as possible from the nightmare of Hollywood that presents movies just like this.",6,2,5,31 October 2004
