Ford v Ferrari," Quite possibly the worst racing movie ever made.
",I am a motorsports professional . . . network radio and print . . . and have personally covered both the 24 Hours of Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring . . . and endurance racing is nothing like what was presented in this movie. I'm sorry . . . this was a complete load of utter crap.,4,1,4,2 May 2020
Independence Day," Absolutely NO STARS!!!
","Possibly the worst big budget film I've ever seen. Ludicrous. To anyone over the age of 14, this is an insult to one's intelligence. What a stinker!!!IMDb says I have to write ten lines of text for this to be posted . . . OK . . . I'll keep writing. That's five so far.This is a major piece of crap. A fried of mine . . . who says that this is one of her favorite movies . . . asked me to rent it from Blockbuster Online or Netflix . . . one of them . . . so I did.Wow . . . I'll have to get my thesaurus out to find more synonyms for yuck. And, I'm trying to keep it PG here!!!Get the airsick bags out.With Thanksgiving coming up, I am thinking about . . . turkey!!! And, I like turkey . . . but not this movie.Phew!!!!Did I get my point across???",1,18,34,24 October 2010
