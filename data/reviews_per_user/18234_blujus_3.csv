Walk the Line," Great performances from the leads, but not much else going for it.
","I watched Walk the Line a couple of evenings ago and thought I'd check out the IMDb response to the film and I just want to ask one thing: Has the world gone mad? 8.1/10? Did you all watch the movie and think 'well I liked the singing in it, so that must mean it's one of the best films of all time'? I mean seriously, if it wasn't for great performances from the two leads, is this film really anything more than a mid-afternoon TV Movie? I thought Reese Witherspoon was fantastic and Joaquim Phoenix, despite not really sounding that much like Johnny Cash, was pretty damn good too - but that's all the film has going for it. Remove them and you've got 'Daydream Believers: The Monkees Story'. Nothing wrong with this film - in fact I seem to remember having quite an amusing time watching it stoned at about 3.30 in the afternoon when I was a student (just after I woke up) - but it's not in the top 100 films of all time and neither is 'Walk the Line: The Johnny Cash Story' It's a 'Well at least that's another two hours of my life enjoyably wasted' 6 out of 10 at best. Or perhaps everyone who reviewed this film had just smoked a fat one before viewing?",6,3,7,9 September 2006
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," Think you might have to be American to get this one....
","If I was American, I'm sure I would have enjoyed this film - it's beautifully made, has incredible effects, great acting, amusing characters and an intriguing story.But... it's just a bit too sickly sweet and schmaltzy - and presents a far too rose-tinted, American-nostalgia-focused account of twentieth century history for a foreigner like me to appreciate. This isn't a criticism - it's an American film after all - more an observation from an outsider's perspective.I suppose a British equivalent might be the film 'Zulu' - great fun to watch if you're a Brit, but kind of insulting if you're a Zulu - and complete pap as far as history goes.It also didn't need to be three hours long. I'm guessing that pretty much half the run time of the film could have been left on the cutting room floor without any effect on the continuity of the story-line - and we would have been spared the inanities of scenes like the series of coincidences leading up to the road accident: pointless, flashy film making all to make a trite point summed up by the phrase 'stuff happens'.Anyway, I can definitely imagine bigger wastes of three hours of my life and there's always the amusement of waiting to see if the baby Brad Pitt will end up disappearing forcibly into someone's womb at the end of the film....",6,4,8,17 February 2009
Children of Men," A beautiful and thought-provoking journey into a near-future dystopia
","If, by going to see this film, you're expecting a slick, action-packed, Hollywood-style thriller, you will be disappointed. There's no flashy CGI, Bruce Willis does not appear in a vest and the hero and the villain do not mysteriously lose their projectile weapons at the end of the movie, in order to be forced to take each other on in hand-to-hand combat.However, if you would like to witness an idea of what a world might be like twenty years from now, if we don't successfully address current issues such as population migration, industrial farming practises, our falling birth-rate, global warming, our poisoning of the seas etc, then this film is worth a watch.Yes it's dark, gritty and depressing and no, there isn't any explanation given as to why the world in the film has ended up the way it is (some people have criticised the film because of this) - but read the news and use your intelligence and it's not hard to imagine how it might happen.*Possible Spoiler* The sequence in the refugee town is one of the most beautiful pieces of cinematography I've ever seen - imagine the grimy, battle-torn city at the end of Full Metal Jacket, combine it with a fire-fight sequence on a par with the start of Saving Private Ryan and check out the looks of utter stunned disbelief on the faces of the soldiers as they hear the sound of a baby crying for (probably) the first time in their lives. The film is worth the price of admission for this scene alone.",Null,4,8,11 October 2006
