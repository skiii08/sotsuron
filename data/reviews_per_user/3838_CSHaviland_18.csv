Blade Runner 2049," A masterpiece for our time, a reflection of our future
","Bladerunner 2049, like the original, is a concept art movie whose DNA is pure introspection wrapped tightly in a silk of ambiance. Various other movies have attempted to introspect on what it means to be human... What humanity is... Bladerunner is among the best of those, but it doesn't stop with just that question. When you analyze the Bladerunner movies together you find yourself sensing metaphors and symbols and outright injections of racism, sexism, elitism, commercialism, and 'isms' I haven't even thought of; exploitation, environmental negligence, invasion of privacy, neglect, police corruption, and abuse of power. It was a frightening glimpse at ourselves today, at our inner nature, at fears ranging from xenophobia to claustrophobia to phobias that haven't been invented yet. Those are the negative things, but you can also find human ingenuity, art, innocence, and the need for love and nostalgia, all but lost like tears in the rain. The pacing of the movie was ponderous because it needed you to digest all of this brain food and eye candy, and it used the music and sound effects and visual effects to keep your attention. The music helped to glue you to the thoughts the movie was injecting you with - and some of them were on the level of subliminal advertising.It remained consistent with the original movie, in continuity with the atmospheric theme but allowing us a more diverse glimpse outside the urban waste-cage and the clutch of overpopulation. But there is no improvement to be found outside the city: it is a lonely place with or without the crowds. The barren desert landscapes, the angry ocean waters, the garbage heaps of San Diego littered with desperate children, and the decadent remains of a sepia-baked Las Vegas were no improvements, and yet the eyes drink it all. The assault of personal space and by unregulated advertisement and human debauchery that sticks to you in like filthy grime was set in stark contrast with a distinct isolation on the outside, no better and no worse, and all welded together with stunning sounds. Both Bladerunner movies are a war between perfection and imperfection: our struggle to create a perfect world for ourselves results in a world decidedly imperfect. This is a world- build set on the unstable ground of organic, cultural, technological and industrial blemishes, the kind we turn our eyes from and pretend they don't exist. Watch both movies and you find yourself buried in things that fail or do not work quite right... Shorting out, dying, rotting, falling into disrepair, scraped up, beaten up... It is the future through the lens of today, rather than through the rosy glasses of yesteryear.There are scenes in the Bladerunner movies (and others) in which the characters really aren't doing anything but thinking or taking a journey. The plot doesn't move and the characters don't develop. When that's done on purpose (see Under the Skin for more-than-enough of that technique) and when the actors and Director of Photography and Sound Designer and Composer aren't on board with what the director is trying to do, it fails. Even if they ARE on board it could fail, so it's a risky art, especially with an enormous amount of studio money, in a system where the studio people can intercede to 'protect' their investment. I felt that this cut could use a little trimming here and there, as we lingered on a person thinking for a few seconds too many, or waiting (without any suspense) for Deckard to finally say, 'Rachel,' and as I waited, in my mind that police loudspeaker was saying: 'Move-on... Move-on... Movie-on...'The question of Deckard's humanity, and the ambiguity that drives everyone to debate it, is the metaphor of ourselves. He is the 'everyman.' What makes us human? Aren't' we all machines, striving for perfection, losing to imperfection, tangled in a war against death for a life of despair we can't seem to win? The unicorn has been used in mythology to symbolize the incarnation of Christ, able to bring back the dead and offer immortality. It did not make an appearance in the second movie. Or did it?",10,6,14,16 October 2017
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," An unspectacular follow-up
","On Stranger Tides wasn't nearly as 'strange' as the third installment, At World's End, nearly as crippled with plot holes, and not even half as spectacular as Dead Man's Chest. While it brings back everyone's favorite two battling pirates, Jack Sparrow and Hector Barbossa, who were played out in all their colorful glory, none of the supporting characters were of great interest at all. Probably most disappointing was Blackbeard, who looked like any other pirate and didn't stand out to me as being a very imposing villain. Compare him with Barbossa when he was a ghost, Tia Dalma and especially Davy Jones. Lots of missed opportunities here. First of all I would have made his beard BLACK, and something you can't take your eyes off of (hence the name), and I would have given him more magical power and sinister dialog. He should have been made into the nastiest, least honorable pirate alive. And I would NEVER have given him a girly daughter.The mermaids were interesting as an idea, but as characters they played too small a role to sustain my attention. The Fountain of Youth was promising when they crossed into it but failed to deliver after they arrived. It was about as visually appealing as... well, an ordinary cave spring, only with a hint of ruins standing within.The movie had many amusing moments, but they were strung together by the traditional pirate clichés and more sword fights that offered nothing we haven't seen before. The background pirates were hardly even noticeable. No lovable sidekick pirates like Ragetti and Pintel or mascots like the undead monkey.All in all it was fun to see Johnny Depp play Jack again, one of his most compelling characters, and Geoffrey Rush's ingenious Barbossa, but if you're looking for something to top Gore Verbinski's trilogy you'll be disappointed.",6,2,5,21 May 2011
World War Z," It was worth seeing, but was it worth making?
","When I first saw the trailers for World War Z, I thought, 'Seriously? More zombies?' Just when I thought the genre had been done to death. I figured the TV series The Walking Dead pretty much capped it. Can't get much better than that for a zombies-are-taking-over-the-world scenario, not because there is anything about the zombies that hasn't been done before, but because The Walking Dead is a very well scripted survival series with an excellent cast playing well developed characters.I honestly had not read the novel on which this movie was based, itself a sequel. And I was quite surprised that there was a bidding war over the rights to it. Could it be really that different from everything else? Well, it's not remarkably different. There is nothing particularly unique about these zombies, or in the story. They have their own particular spin, and set of rules. They bite, and that spreads some kind of disease. Seen that before. They're quick. Seen that before too, but I think this is the most tireless I've ever seen them portrayed.But they aren't technically zombies... That is, you don't have to die first, and they don't seem to be 'eating' people, just biting them. It's more like a super-virus with zombie-like characteristics, infecting people extremely fast (within seconds), while they are still alive. Once zombified, the victim exerts energy that would make the world's greatest athletes jealous. They are fast, tireless, feel no pain or emotion, somewhat strong, and really hard to 'kill.' There is also a way to walk among the zombies without being attacked, which is slightly unique. In some zombie movies you just have to act like a zombie, or disguise yourself with zombie stench, but World War Z introduced its own take.At any rate, it's a fast-moving plot with several visually spectacular sequences. Brad Pitt carries the film.As a writer myself, I think the screenplay missed the opportunity to vastly increase tension. They should have kept his family on the brink of danger. Instead, his family was given relative safety. I wouldn't have done that. There is nothing more stressful to a father and husband than to put his children and wife in danger and keep him from helping them. This would have been much more suspenseful and emotionally engaging.World War Z was a fun movie to watch, and while it didn't 'redefine' the subgenre, it moved the needle a little bit by creating EXTREME zombie energy. (These guys are DESPERATE to bite people! They reminded me of a blend of army ant and killer bee behavior.) So it was worth seeing, but I have to wonder why it was worth making? Did the genre really need this? Was it worth the risk for Plan B (Pitt's company) to win the bidding war? Not so sure.For Pitt's sake I hope it does well enough for him but I would sure like to sunset the zombie subgenre because I'm getting fairly tired of it.",7,0,7,21 June 2013
Alien," Classic Gothic Horror
","Alien (by Ridley Scott), despite some opinions to the contrary, is an exceptional piece of film-making. It is, in fact, an icon of horror science fiction, better than anything of its kind until that date (1979). Bad films are ignored, and this portrait of character has been anything but ignored. It is therefore by popular opinion a significant and memorable work of Gothic horror. Those who disapprove of Alien are generally eager for action horror, and this is not an action horror. Aliens (by James Cameron) was an action horror - a very different kind of movie. Alien 3 was a Gothic horror once more, but not even comparable in quality as Ridley Scott's vision. Alien Resurrection was an action horror, but not even comparable in quality as James Cameron's vision. If you are interested in the *aesthetic* use of film in this sub-genre, there are few movies that surpass this one. Prove me wrong.",10,1,3,1 August 2009
Pacific Rim," Sappiness dragged down an otherwise cool concept
","Ever since the original Gojira in 1954, a serious movie about a giant monster tearing down our civilized world, I've been hungry for an epic movie with the same treatment.The wait goes on. And the reason is because the subject matter is rarely taken seriously. In fact movies of this ilk are intentionally goofy or tongue-in-cheek, and Pacific Rim is well within that range. It's as if the storytellers feel that there is no way to treat the subject matter in a serious way. After all, it's ridiculous to have giant monsters rise out of the sea and knock down buildings, right? So why not make movies about it that are just as ridiculous?Really bad thinking.All of the Godzilla movies made by Toho since the 1954 movie were dumbed down, made for kids. The Roland Emmerich Godzilla in 1998 was full of ham. Cloverfield was serious, but the found-footage hyper-POV format killed the epic, global flavor that I wanted.I had high hopes for Pacific Rim, but I was very disappointed. The scientists really killed it. They were so ridiculous I was embarrassed every time they had a scene.Also, Pacific Rim is as much about giant fighting robots as about the giant monsters. The movie began by summarizing an entire history wherein these creatures attacked us, with a few glimpses of them, and jumped forward to begin our story when we already were at war with them using giant robots. It rubs me the wrong way to tell stories in this manner, but I keep an open mind on a case-by-case basis. District 9 used that format, wherein it started long after the aliens have already arrived, rather than chronicling the arrival itself. But I was fine with it. But in Pacific Rim I felt like I was watching a sequel to a movie that was never made.The battles between robot and monster were very hard to see. There was always darkness, pouring rain, splashing ocean water... I felt like I rarely got a good view of the monsters.But all of that I would have forgiven if they had expunged it of sappy scientists acting like cocaine addicts and spouting things that made no sense.I look forward to Gareth Edwards' Godzilla treatment next year to see if he finally breaks the trend.",7,6,15,14 July 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," Even better than the original
","Po is a kung fu legend who can't seem to act like one. He's a goofball with a good heart, and tries hard to fill a serious role, but he thinks that also means being cool, which unfortunately never works out for him. You have to give him credit for lack of embarrassment. He's not ashamed of himself, because he knows he's doing the best he can, and people look up at him anyway.The story naturally fills a gap left by the first movie that we didn't realize was there, so it did not feel as though it was repeating itself. His lesson is a new one, and the lessons fits well with the adventure that has been thrust upon him this time. Funniest animated feature since Tangled, and well worth an afternoon with your kids!",9,0,3,29 May 2011
Bad Teacher," Bad Teacher, Worse Movie
","A truly uninspired comedy with lackluster writing, weak plotting, and very little comedy. Apparently conceived to capitalize on the bathroom-humor fad, this entry by the makers of The Office should have gone through more rewrites, and perhaps -- dare I suggest it -- given to some other writers for some fresher comedy and character arcs that actually make sense. Cameron Diaz plays Elizabeth Halsey who has no interest in teaching. When the movie opens, she's already been there a full year. I can't imagine how she made it through the first year without anyone realizing how horrible she was. She quits the job because she's found a rich boyfriend and is using him for his money, but her boyfriend's mother wises up and their pending wedding is canceled. So she must return to her dreaded job, and based on what we see on screen she's so incompetent that it seems ridiculous that the principal and the school board never notice. It would have been far more believable if she had been a new teacher who was forced into the role for some clever reason. Maybe she should have been trying to make moves on the principal, who became love blind and pulled strings to get her the position -- which she didn't want but needed to take in order to get something out of the principal she needed. She's a user in the extreme, superficial to the last, with no moral values that I can see. So it makes no sense for her to have ever pursued teaching as a career.Now, it is normal for characters to grow and transform as the story progresses. That is what story's are all about, in fact. But Halsey doesn't grow or transform at all. She only 'tries harder' at teaching so that she can win a contest to get money to pay for a boob-job, which she believes she needs to attract another teacher who comes from a wealthy family. When her students seem to be failing to meet the standards she needs, she finds a way to steal the answers to the school tests so that she can train up her students on how to pass it (they don't show how she manages this). This plot works, but she is caught by another teacher. Does this teach her a lesson? No, she adds blackmail and other tricks to her list of crimes and wins that battle too. By the end of the movie she has not redeemed herself at all, and I had to wonder how these writers can consider themselves professionals.I'm giving the movie a 5, which is being nice. Cameron Diaz is too good for roles like this, she needs to choose more carefully.",5,2,7,30 June 2011
Saw III," Can't say as the posters make me want to see these movies, but the movies are great fun!
","As I have said before, I am not a big fan of chop horror... There are very few exceptions. The Saw series is just brilliant for its genre, because the 'bad guy' is completely opposite the expected norm. He's a dying man who doesn't 'directly' kill anyone, but is so brilliant that he knows how to manipulate people into killing others by not sacrificing themselves. He is, of course, a murderer in any court of law, but he doesn't think of himself as one. He says he despises murderers. That is what is smart about this franchise, because the character of JigSaw is not unlike some psychopathic murderers in the real world, who do not see that they are really doing anything wrong. In contrast they may even see themselves as doing something very right.This unconventional series continues to engage in suspenseful plot twists that keep you wondering what JigSaw has up his other sleeve.As for the posters, which are intended to attract people into the theater? GASP. I did not watch Saw II and III at the theater precisely because I thought the poster was revolting and I have no interest in torture-fests (ala Hostel, which was dreadful). Gosh, you'd think I didn't have to say that torture is not entertainment, but I guess for some people it is. It's not the torture that is good about Saw III, it's the plot twisting and the character of JigSaw himself. But except for the first one, I managed to catch up on the series on DVD.",8,0,0,1 August 2009
Unknown," Worth your money
","An ingenious script that echoes concepts, plotting, pace and intrigue from mysteries such as Nowhere Man, Frantic and The Bourne Identity. Once again, Liam Neeson shows his prowess in choosing projects of high interest and executes a performance that connects well with his audience.To put this in context, mystery thrillers are very hard to pull off anymore. Filmmakers must create layers of mysteries that the audience cannot easily second guess, peel them back one by one to reveal answers that themselves sometimes turn into mysteries later, and resolve all of them in 2 hours without seeming contrived or obvious. To make it more challenging, the characters must be empathetic, the action sequences satisfying, the pace agreeable, the dialog convincing, and the setting compelling.Director Jaume Collet-Serra has pulled it off again, following on the heels of another successful thriller, Orphan. This director is a rising star.",9,43,84,19 February 2011
Super 8," Fun, Sweet, Funny, Scary, Nostalgic SF
","Coming out of Super 8, I felt as though it was the early 80's again, or sometime in my own childhood. That is not because it was set in the early 80's, however. It's because J.J. Abrams engineered a style of film that reminded me of a monster movie formula of the 60's combined with a science fiction formula of the 70's and early 80's. It definitely has a Spielbergian echo, with thematic homages to movies Spielberg directed like E.T., Close Encounters of the Third Kind, and Jaws, and produced in his early years like Poltergeist, Gremlins, and The Goonies (when he was more creatively involved). Monster movie motifs were found all over the place, ranging from zombie flicks (the type of Super 8 movie the kids were making) to Them and Earth vs The Spider, as well as cult SF alien invasion movies like Invaders From Mars.Abrams thankfully avoids the shaky-cam trend of modern movie making and takes more time setting up shots and angles that work in the moment, another Spielberg and Hitchcock style I wish more directors would adapt.That is not to say that Super 8 isn't original. Every child carries genes of his or her parents, grandparents and ancestors, but is still unique. It is a great adventure movie featuring a group of kids doing things not unlike what I tried to do when I was young (but with a lot better resources than were available to me), and so it reached me personally not only in style but in content.For younger audiences, who may not have even been born until the mid-80's (or later), and who haven't taken the time to watch movies from earlier years, should find it fresh, fun and interesting, and unlike your typical Michael Bay action film, easy to watch.No matter how it performs in today's box office climate, I think Super 8 will prove to be a classic in later years.",9,3,7,11 June 2011
Thor," A surprising superhero movie, but could have been better
","I had often wondered how they would introduce Thor at the movies, because unlike most of the other Marvel superheroes thus far, Thor in his comic origins has a basis in mythology rather than science fiction (or science fantasy, if you take my meaning) and originates off- world. Like Superman, he comes from a fantastic planet whose science and physics are so beyond ours that from our viewpoint it is magic. (This does not explain why they all look human, but let's not go there.)What I imagined from the movie was that they would feature Asgard at the beginning, for an origin sequence, and the rest would take place on Earth. Turns out, Kenneth Branagh and the writers plotted the movie on Asgard for at least 50% of the screen time. This, I think, saved the movie. The otherworldly sequences were the most interesting and important elements of the story, and looked fantastic. This not a movie about Thor on Earth, it's a movie about Thor's conflicts with his father Odin and his sneaky step-brother Loki, wherein his banishment to Earth was just a part of the story arc. Part of the problem with the Earth-side story is that it's boring. It's set in a very small New Mexico town in the desert. Thor befriends an ambitious astronomical researcher Jane Foster, played by Natalie Portman, whose character seems to have no real depth because we never get to know her personally. In fact somehow he falls in love with her, but I'm not sure how or why this happened. At any rate, the major battle scene on Earth takes place between Thor (with his entourage, who comes to fetch him) and a powerful golem from Asgard that seems remotely controlled by Loki (somehow). The golem (the Destroyer from the comics) was great, but he trashes nothing more than a tiny desert town. Or more specifically, main street in the tiny town (although I don't think there are many other streets to trash). Thor defeats him, end of the Destroyer. That's it? To me this missed a huge opportunity for a more epic battle. It should have taken place in a huge metropolis. Perhaps a Northern European city (because why does it always happen in America?) closer to where apparently the wormholes interacted with the Norse (resulting in the mythology). In fact if Thor crashed in New Mexico, fine, but I would have had his hammer land in Scandinavia or thereabouts, which would have made for a much nicer backdrop, and thus drawing our characters and the conflict to that region. I would have had the Destroyer toppling skyscrapers and smashing castles before Thor could stop him, leaving a path of destruction several hundred miles long through Europe. Not little old Western stores and a café. And the Destroyer should have made a much bigger mess of his friends.So had the movie spent all its time in a little New Mexico town and its surrounding desert and not returned to Asgard or Jotunheim (the world of the Frost Giants, enemies of the Asgardians) for action, the movie would have fallen flat on its face. I suppose there could have been a budgetary reason why they didn't 'go urban' on the Earth- side, because special effects of this rendering scale are not cheap, and they did front-load quite a bit on Asgard.Chris Hemsworth was okay as Thor, but the character seemed a little too winky and toothy at times. I would have had him cocky and snobby, but not so chipper. His friends seemed a little too much like a bunch of 'hang-out dudes' (plus childhood gal-pal) than a band of adventurers. I would have made them a little more serious. Chris Hemsworth in particular does look like Thor -- well chiseled and sufficiently Scandinavian looking -- but his acting doesn't have a lot of believable range. He'll need to work on that.All in all it was a good, but not great, movie. It will not come close to the success of Iron Man or Iron Man 2. But it wasn't a flawed mess like the first Hulk movie was.BTW: the 3d is worth it for the space sequences and Asgard. And as with all the Avengers-era movies, need I mention, wait for the Easter Egg at the tail of the end credits.",7,1,4,7 May 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," A good but dry film, igniting overreactions from all sides
","Zero Dark Thirty was a gritty, docudrama-like movie much in the flavor of Black Hawk Down and Munich. Unlike the Hollywood fiction formula of old, you won't find a 'love interest' and 'comic relief.' It is a dry film - meaning the plot had very little bandwidth and the characters were all business.As such, it is a not a theme that greatly interests me, or attracts me to the theater. In fact I go to the theater to escape dwelling on these types of realities, not immerse myself in them.Nonetheless I'm compelled to voice my opinion on this one because the film is harshly criticized for an assortment of reasons. possibly some even conflicting. I thought the film portrayed itself exactly as Katheryn Bigelow (whose career I've followed since Near Dark, not since The Hurt Locker like most younger people) advertised. 'Boots on the ground.' The story is very zoomed in, not zoomed out.I avoid movies like this because I have very little interest in the political opinions of Hollywood (or of anyone else for that matter). Opinions are opinions, and I give none more or less weight than my own, frankly. Harlan Ellison is quoted of saying, 'You are not entitled to your opinion. You are entitled to your informed opinion.' Which is an agreeable notion, but it depends on the quality of the information, doesn't it? And how can you confirm that information? If one is misinformed, his or her 'informed' opinion may be of nor more value than an ignorant one.I never felt that Zero Dark Thirty was taking any stand for or against torture. There were no debates or analysis or reflection between the characters on the merits or ethics of water boarding and other methods of duress interrogation. It's only risk was to choose to depict members of the CIA using torture as it is commonly defined, and there are strong opinions that we did no such thing. Those opinions, I daresay, are based entirely on what one wants to believe, not on facts. The facts, unfortunately, are elusive. I assume we did torture, based on my gut feeling on how various officials reacted to the question, especially President Bush. But it's just an assumption on my part - I am not informed, and neither are most people.So Zero Dark Thirty made some assumptions, based largely on information fed by the Obama Administration (which is an eyebrow-raiser for most Republicans of course) and built a story about the long and arduous hunt for Osama Bin Laden. Despite claims to the contrary, there was nothing political about how the movie played this out. I was actually quite relieved. It didn't point accusing fingers, act ashamed, or express pride. Intelligence mistakes that occurred were human ones. It was an extremely difficult hunt, with CIA members sometimes chasing bad information that looked pretty good at the time. In fact, the final attack on Osama's compound (which was amazingly powerful) was itself an exercise in probability, not fact. We didn't know for sure Osama was that compound, but there were lots of compelling reasons to think he was. Similarly, the CIA didn't know for sure that Iraq wasn't hiding WMD production, but there were lots of compelling reasons to think they were. In one case we made a judgment call and lost, in another we made a judgment call and won. I'm sorry to say, that's the way the game is usually played.So if you like this genre, this is a movie well worth seeing. If you flatly refuse to believe we tortured anybody in the war against al qaeda, probably you will be angered by the film, but I'm betting you haven't a shred of proof one way or the other. I don't, and neither do the filmmakers. So put your crystal balls down and try to enjoy.",7,6,13,12 January 2013
The Conjuring," Much better horror than the usual fare
","There has been a lot of horror in the past 5 years. A lot of it seems to be in love with the 'found footage' format which frankly is getting very tiring. I'm happy to see that not everyone thinks horror has to have a shaky first-person camera.James Wan is a terrific horror director with very good instincts. He is old-school. I never caught Saw in a theater, because I'm not usually attracted to horrors that aren't fantasy (slasher-based horrors), with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre being a rare exception. But when I did catch up to Saw I was struck by its wonderful suspense and plot twisting. I am surprised, however, that Wan's directing career took a long hiatus. It seems to be firing up better now.Like the rest of Wan's work, The Conjuring has strong character and plot building, and careful camera work. I've seen so many horror movies that nothing really scares me anymore, and yet Wan's Insidious chilled me in a few scenes, so I was really looking forward to The Conjuring. While I didn't feel it was quite as scary for me as Insidious, it has its moments. Sure got some screams out of the audience! And that's what's fun about seeing horrors at the theater anyway.The Conjuring is alleged to be based on a true story, and I really liked the attention Wan gave not just to the victims but to the investigators, weaving the personal lives of two families around the events in a classic haunted house.I will always be looking out for another James Wan movie to see!",8,0,1,1 August 2013
X-Men: First Class," Pretty good contextual movie
","Better scripted than X-Men: The Last Stand, and about equal with X-Men Origins: Wolverine. So by that rule of thumb if you hated the Wolverine movie then you'll probably hate this one; if you really enjoyed the Wolverine movie (as I did) then you have a good chance of enjoying this one. It created a good context for Magneto's behavioral origins, as well as his use of power. I thought that was well thought out. Unfortunately they compromised their quality script with a glaring continuity problem -- Charles Xavier is in a wheelchair by the end of this movie, which takes place in the 60's, but he was seen in another movie as a much older Professor X (Patrick Stewart) walking... I'm not referring to his walking in a telepathic state, as in the original X-Men movie, but actually walking in a flashback to the '80's in X-Men: The Last Stand, when he and Magneto discovered Phoenix. So either the filmmakers were ignorant of this issue (which is surprisingly possible -- you'd be frightened to learn how little some filmmakers know about the material they are assigned to direct or produce or even write!), or they chose to ignore this continuity problem (as many filmmakers do), or they plan on having him walk temporarily at some point later in life, in some fashion that will be explained... But I doubt the latter. It's more likely that the filmmakers decided to do what ever they wanted to do, and believe that their own story shouldn't be confined by any franchise continuity -- it's an ego thing, not a logical thing. Happened in Star Trek all the time. Could also be that they decided they hated X-Men: The Last Stand and chose to ignore just that particular movie, which is also not unprecedented. (The makers of Jaws: The Revenge chose to ignore Jaws 3-d, but it was just as terrible.)But if you are willing to look past that, this is well worth seeing at the theater.",7,1,5,3 June 2011
The Wolverine," Worth seeing for a deep dive into Wolverine
","I appreciated this movie on a number of levels. For one, it tried to be different from its predecessors by not getting carried away by spectacle. I like epic super-hero movies but they don't all have to be that way. Sometimes they just need a little quiet time, to reflect on who they are and where they are going. For another, it maintained continuity with both X-Men Origins: Wolverine and X-Men III: The Last Stand, so that we don't feel like the filmmakers are re-inventing the character and thumbing what other directors have done with him.This movie was introspective. Wolverine knows basically where he came from now. He joined Professor X but obviously didn't stick around the school. He suffers from chronic nightmares. And he suffers from a sense of purposelessness, which is what leads a lot of people to MDD (major depressive disorder) and suicide. But Wolverine doesn't age (at least not like most people), and heals so quickly that he's very hard to kill. What to do? The movie helps to reset him, to remind them that his fate is tied to a purpose. He just needs to stop moping around about his condition and own it.Some of the action sequences are tremendous, especially the train. You don't have to knock down skyscrapers to have a breathtaking fight scene.Hugh Jackman takes his role very seriously. He always trains for the part, and his physique is really killer now. Unlike other actors like Christian Bale, who give up interest in playing the same super-hero, Jackman has no problem returning to the role over and over and building something new out of it. He'll be back again for X-Men: Days of Future Past. He is the only actor to appear in all of the X-Men movies playing Wolverine, with only a few seconds in X-Men First Class (which itself was a great film, but with continuity problems otherwise), and it helps to tie the franchise together. (Days of Future Past is rumored to try to fix some of the continuity errors, but we'll see.) I am to the point that I want to see a Hugh Jackman movie, no matter what it is. He's arrived as a great action star.",7,0,2,1 August 2013
The Purge," Questionable psychology, contrived plot, repetitive thrills
","I almost never give any movies less than 5 stars unless the filmmakers clearly dismiss the art and science of movie storytelling (such as what you might find from the likes of Charles Band, Ed Wood, or Troma). Movies in which the filmmakers are trying but fail will get something from 4-6 stars from me.Reviewers who give even movies like this '1 star' are abusing the rating system. To think that there could be no movies worse than this is ridiculous. Just watch the SyFy channel's original monster movies, like Mansquito. I dare you. The Purge does not rate at THAT level.The Purge has a provocative idea: what if one day a year there was almost no law enforcement, so people were allowed to steal, commit violence, murder, rape, etc, without any police or legal interference? The movie takes that a step further and suggests that our culture evolves to promote this behavior as somehow patriotic, as it supposedly helped to rid our nation of violence for the rest of the year.There are some precedents in history for barbaric annual festivals of this kind, but not to the effect that they created peace for the rest of the year.The problem with the movie is that it misunderstands human psychology. The idea is that we all have a violent nature, and that violence in any culture can be attributed to our need to vent that nature, as if it were pressure building up in us like a tea kettle. This is not the case.While every human has the capacity for violence, this is quite different from having a drive to be violent, even if the situation presents itself. There are some interesting studies on mob behavior, which has a bizarre counter-active effect on typical individual personality and behavior. And I think there is a genetic disposition toward competition, which is what drives people to love sports. And there are some who have a desire to hunt, which is mainly an echo from the millions of years of human survival strategy, especially before we learned how to farm. But it is not correct to presuppose that most humans would choose to go out and commit extreme recreational violence and harm against others, even murder, just to support a national holiday or purge themselves of some instinctive pressure to be violent.Cultures that exhibit wanton violence are the result of being taught that violence is expected or required of them from a very early age. Vikings and Spartans are well known examples of such societies. A misguided and hateful culture can steer collective human behavior for some time before it is 'normalized.' Surely the Nazis have shown how dangerous this can be.But without cultural pressure, humans have a high capacity for feeling shame. I think more than any other organism, possibly in Earth's history, humans indulge in a sort of psychological self-flagellation, a self-loathing that extends not just to one's self but one's gender, one's country, even one's race. I am hearing people complaining that humans are evil rubbish, comparing us to viruses (which is ironic considering how successful viruses are, and how most viruses are harmless and some have even contributed to the evolutionary advancement of life), and that we deserve to be 'wiped out' before we 'destroy the planet.' People with these feelings might envision a movie like this as being completely accurate. In fact, they prove the movie is not - because self shame would neutralize self-indulgent violence toward others. Most humans who are not sociopathic also have a tendency toward high empathy, not only to other humans but to other creatures. This also tilts the balance toward non-violence.The movie, as shown in the trailers, attempted to demonstrate a family that did not choose to participate in this festival. They hunkered down to ride out the storm. But the point of the movie seems to be that a majority of people seem to choose violence because they feel it helps them and helps society for the rest of the year. Not just violence but weird, psychotic behavior.(If you wait to the credits you'll hear the suggestion that Dallas, Texas has the highest number of participants. A thinly veiled political stab?) I am growing ever-so-tired of Hollywood's cock-eyed perception that the 'upper class' is made up of unsympathetic, selfish, elitist bigots. It's almost as tiresome as the idea that the military is nothing but a legal mob of evil warmongers, and that our democratic republic is a group of rights-violating conspirators intending to take advantage of the 'underprivileged.' These clichés are overused and their logic is unimpressive. At least The Purge chose main characters who were among that so-called 'upper-class' who do not behave that way. Had they been some poor family fighting to survive attacks by the rich, I would have dropped the movie to four stars... Maybe three.Shoving all that aside and looking at it as a popcorn movie, there are other problems. The plot was too contrived, and full of thriller clichés.Example: do you remember a moment from any movie in which an important character is about to be killed by a bad guy, but suddenly the bad guy is killed in the last second, saving our hero's life? I'll bet you've seen that dozens of times over the last 20 years, right? Well in The Purge you'll see it not once, not twice, but at least three times! Even a new untested screenwriter shouldn't be making mistakes like that.I could go on. The point is: this movie is made up of gratuitous well-worn thrills based on a spurious psychology.I would pass on this one.",5,2,3,9 June 2013
Moon," Great SF
","In a year so many weak and disappointing movies, this is a gem. It not only stands out among movies released in 2009, it stands out among science fiction movies in general. And let's make sure we're on the same page with the term 'science fiction.' Lord of the Rings is not science fiction! It's fantasy. Why people would confuse that I have no idea. Star Wars is a gray line. Space Opera (which is how Star Wars is defined) is fantasy in the guise of science fiction, because it's not about scientific concepts, it just uses motifs borrowed from science fiction in a fantasy context. Fantasy is all about magic and the impossible, science fiction (that is hard science fiction) is all about what is possible or may be possible within the realm of science as we currently understand it. Moon is science fiction, and it's a rarity. It's very simply a story about a guy up on the moon by himself. Which on paper looks like it would be very boring. But it's not. Actor Sam Rockwell carries the entire film by himself and does an amazing job at building a very suspenseful plot.This is a limited release, so you have to hunt it down, but it's worth it.",8,5,8,1 August 2009
The Proposal," Charming though Predictable
","Most charming Sandra Bullock movie since While You Were Sleeping, though quite a bit more predictable. (Anyone who knows the general premise can guess how the movie is going to play out.) But it was funny and sweet, and if you need to choose something to take your wife/girlfriend to, choose this one.Sandy's attempting a Miranda Priestly-type character (Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada) which doesn't actually suit her acting style very well, but when you get used to her she's fun to watch. And she has great comic timing. So does Ryan Reynolds for that matter, who has a way of just looking perplexed that can make you snicker.",7,43,61,1 August 2009
