The Blair Witch Project," very chilling movie!!
","I saw 'The Blair Witch Project' in Memphis yesterday, and let me tell you, you have to see this!! It is one of the creepiest movies ever made. The final 30 seconds of the movie is the best part, and it is one of the best endings I have ever seen in a movie, and definitely the best in a horror movie. The final scene is so creepy, it makes me scared just thinking about it. It's a totally original movie (well, almost). The atmosphere of the movie reminds me of 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre', which, by the way, is my favorite horror movie. The movie has a lot of profanity in it, but it is worth watching again just to see the ending again. To fully understand the ending, you have to understand the stories at the beginning. I was actually scared last night before I went to bed, and it's been a long time since I was that scared after a movie.I went into this movie thinking it was a true story, and I think this is the best way to approach the movie. I had a unique, unsettling experience unlike any I've had in watching a movie before. A warning: this movie will not work for you unless you use a lot of imagination during and after the movie.
After the movie, you are not likely to say, 'Wow, that was a really scary movie.' It is in the hours that follow after the movie when you think about the ending and the rest of the movie when the horror really sets in. This is no 'Scream', 'Halloween', or 'Friday the 13th.' It is a refreshing turn for the better for the horror genre after a recent raft of hip teen horror flicks like 'Scream', 'I Know What you did', and 'Carrie 2'.
Just don't turn the lights off when you get home.",8,1,1,1 August 1999
