The King's Speech," The Majestic Roar of THE KING'S SPEECH
","As a document of a little known history of pre-World War II England, The King's Speech is a fascinating, heart rending dramatization of King George VI, who assumed the throne despite a debilitating speech problem at a time when his country needed him the most. Well directed by TV veteran Tom Hooper (John Adams) from a lifelong project by screenwriter David Seidler, it boasts Colin Firth's (Bridget Jones Diary, A Single Man) best performance as the beleaguered king and award caliber support by Geoffrey Rush (Shine, Elizabeth) and Helena Bonham Carter (Alice in Wonderland, Room With a View).In 1925, Prince Albert (Colin Firth), who is second in line to the throne, gives a speech through BBC radio at Wembley Stadium in England, and it goes poorly as he hesitates and stumbles his words much to the astonishment of the crowd. He has a stuttering problem that is revealed in the most public and humiliating way. By the 1930's in London, Albert is subjected to a multitude of therapies and remedies that range from speaking with a mouthful of marbles to smoking! His frustration grows until he abandons any hope of solving his affliction. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), seeks out an obscure, Australian speech therapist, Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), who feels confident he can cure the prince. A struggling actor himself, Logue has a playful sense of humor that does not ingratiate himself with the future King of England. It is a humbling process, but he slowly brings the prince out of his timid and isolated shell. They work on a progression of methods which includes utilizing recordings and headphones and delves into Albert's childhood. The therapy sessions are not without setbacks but a bond develops into a strong friendship. As 1936 approaches, King George V dies, and when The Prince of Wales (Guy Pierce) abdicates the throne to be with an American divorcée, the title and responsibility fall on Prince Albert who is desperate not to be placed in this position when England needs a leader. As the clouds of war approach Europe, Prince Albert is named King George VI on December 12, 1936. With England on the brink of declaring war on Germany, and a radio broadcast to all of England and the world, George summons Logue to coach him through the most important speech of his life. With Logue at his side to guide his every word, George speaks to the nation.Hooper does a very straightforward job without having to resort to flashy camera-work but instead lets his actors do what they do best-act! This long gestating screenplay started with Seidler as a child stutterer listening to radio broadcasts of the king, and it was not until his widow, the Queen Mother, died that he had her conditional consent to tackle the story. It does play a bit with facts but never loses sight of the core relationship of the two disparate men and how a common actor taught a prince to be king. Technical production is excellent all around from the impressive period costumes and art direction to the dramatic score and dark hued cinematography.It is the interplay and war of wills between Firth and Rush that is the delicious center of this relationship based story. Reunited after having costarred in Shakespeare in Love, both actors are at the top of their game, and part of the fun is that despite the seriousness of the therapy, there are humorous moments to savor. Carter plays 'less is more' in one of her more conventional roles, and she is quite convincing as royalty. Some nice turns are made by acting royalty, Michael Gambon, Guy Pierce, Derek Jacobi, and Claire Bloom among others.The story adds texture in the family details by revealing George V as a domineering father. The troubles of George VI are shown in intimate scenes with his children as he tries to read a story but is handicapped by his impediment. The documentary footage of Hitler's mastery of public speaking is studied with fascination and almost envy by George. It is an ironic yet telling scene. Logue adores his own family, and his down to earth persona is in sharp contrast to George VI's more formal yet heartfelt affections for his family. There is a good contrast made of the King's life from that of the common man. In the scene where George VI is crowned King, he must address his court and realizes that everyone, even his own family, will now treat him differently. Life will never be the same again. When George VI makes his speech at the end, we see that he is learning to be a king.As a piece of history, The King's Speech is thoroughly engaging, but what makes it affecting is one man's triumph over adversity with the support of a loving wife and the friendship of a unique therapist.",10,0,2,25 February 2011
Moneyball," The Remarkable Lessons of MONEYBALL
","Truth may be stranger than fiction, but when the sports world is shaken by a methodology that will revolutionize the business of baseball, it becomes an amazing story born out of need. Adapted from the Michael Lewis' bestseller by Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network) and Steven Zaillian (Schindler's List) and directed by Bennett Miller (Capote), Moneyball is a fascinating look at how the sport of baseball was turned on its head and its implications that reverberate to this day. It's also about the bond a father has with his daughter that is stronger than any contract.In 2001, Oakland Athletics general manager and former player Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is trying to keep his star players from being bought by financially wealthier teams like the New York Yankees. Desperate to field a winning team with a hopelessly limited budget, he happens upon an analyst for the Cleveland Indians named Peter Brand (a winning Jonah Hill) who has statistics to back up his theory that the best players are not necessarily the costliest ones. Rather than compete with the big teams, Beane realizes that the underrated players who are statistically on base the most will translate into runs scored and ultimately wins. The remarkable thing is that these players can be obtained at bargain basement salaries. The concept goes against conventional wisdom and immediately creates friction among the veteran scouts and even the A's manager (played to perfection by Philip Seymour Hoffman). A former star recruit himself, Beane blew his chance for stardom at an early age and is now sharing custody of his teenage daughter with his ex-wife (Robin Wright). He loves his girl and fears that losing his job will force him to move farther away from her. As the team begins to show signs of becoming a winning organization, a remarkable string of wins begins that will make history and have far reaching consequences for the game of baseball.This is one of the best roles Pitt has ever had. The dialogue is perfectly suited to him, and he delivers flawlessly. It's the kind of role you could easily picture with a younger Robert Redford. When he says things that stun his personnel staff by deviating from common practice and status quo, it is a hoot. I mean he really shakes things up because he is willing to try just about anything to win games, and it also means changing a culture of losing into a winning attitude. Just watching the negotiations and deal making behind the scenes is fascinating. You also get a realistic perspective from the clubhouse as players come and go, but these are people too with families, and the film does not shortchange this point of view.What elevates this film from its novel plot line is the genuine relationship between Billy and his daughter that influences his priorities. He isn't just a general manager but a father, and the film never loses this perspective to its credit. When the team's fortunes change dramatically by the end, an astonishing opportunity presents itself to Billy that puts him at a career crossroads, and the baseball world takes notice.Even non-baseball enthusiasts may find this a fascinating story because it is character driven with strong performances by its cast. (Sports movies get made with semi-regularity, but when did a studio make a film about personnel management of a major sports team?) When you think about the recent championship success of teams like the Boston Red Sox and look at this film, the connections are mind boggling. And while this new age in personnel management is a story onto itself, the one constant through it all is a father's love for his daughter. Top notch all the way.",10,0,1,24 February 2012
The Avengers," Whedon Assembles a Mighty AVENGERS
","In the 1960s, Marvel Comics pioneered mature story lines for its super heroes, of whom many have been successfully adapted into blockbuster films (Spiderman). The Avengers were a group with individual icons like Iron Man who had already established identities contrary to The Fantastic Four and X Men. Marvel began to feature stand alone films that methodically built this core of characters, and several years later, it has culminated in The Avengers, a thoroughly entertaining adventure that never fails to engage and 'marvel' its intended audience. As orchestrated by versatile writer/director and comic book fan Joss Whedon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer), the results set a high standard in filmic super heroics; it's nirvana, a comic lover's dream come true.The Tesseract is a cube with unknown powers and coveted by the fiendish Loki, Thor's half brother. Kept for study by SHIELD, the elite security agency, (and once possessed by The Red Skull in Captain America: The First Avenger), the cube can open a doorway to another dimension. When Loki steals the cube to unleash a demon army and conquer the earth, the SHIELD agents are no match for his supernatural powers. What to do? Who ya gonna call? Well, there's nothing like 'puttin' the band together' for the first time. Assembled by SHIELD director Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson) and aided by Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg), the Avengers Initiative sought to collect special operatives in the event of an insurmountable threat that was beyond human response. These Avengers comprise of six extraordinary individuals: an otherworldly warrior, Thor (Chris Hemsworth), a genetically enhanced superhuman from the past, Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans), a meek scientist, Dr. Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and his anger induced, gamma radiated monster, The Hulk; inventor Tony Stark, in super armor as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), and two SHIELD agents, master archer Hawkeye, Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner), and top assassin Black Widow, Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson). When Loki's legion of soldiers descend on Manhattan, it's 'Avengers Assemble' time. Drawn by remarkable circumstances and led by Captain America, it's teamwork at its finest as The Avengers battle these nasty hordes to save the earth. After initially bickering and fighting each other, it is fascinating to witness such disparate personalities coalesce into a fighting unit as they flow from self to selflessness. This film can stand on its own for newbies not familiar with the previous films, but it certainly does not hurt to have seen Captain America: The First Avenger, Thor, Iron Man, and The Incredible Hulk. Whedon and company neatly tie the threads of those films together with sufficient focus given to each hero's personal life. We learn some interesting background on Romanoff and Barton, who you think would be outmatched by their superhuman colleagues, but they more than hold their own and figure prominently in the explosive climax. Rogers, the honorable, idyllic soldier, has to adjust to a world like a modern day Rip Van Winkle. Dr. Banner keeps his anger at bay, but what will that mean for the Avengers if it can't be controlled? Whedon also cleverly includes familiar supporting characters e.g. Stark's assistant, Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow), from other the films.All the stars perform ably including Tom Hiddleston who is appropriately devious as Loki. Downey, who clearly improvised much of his dialogue, has a rousing, good time. Jackson embodies Fury as the manipulative leader who does whatever it takes to safeguard humanity.This is the third movie version of The Hulk, and while Ruffalo does a very good job as the sensitive and haunted Banner, his alter ego beast actually behaves so unpredictably that some of his actions become comedic and the results are a riot. To say more would spoil some hilarious moments. The filmmakers got this Hulk right. A couple things don't quite add up like how does The Hulk decide to be a do-gooder at a critical moment? Who is the mysterious Council (resembling the Syndicate from The X Files) that SHIELD answers to, and what are their intentions? There are, however, nice touches like the Stark building in the finale and what is left of its logo as an obvious tribute to the Avengers. When the grand showdown is imminent, there is a marvelous circular shot of the Avengers that is iconic. When the evil army attacks, one is reminded of Ghostbusters and the apocalyptic scenes of Superman II and any Transformers film. Whedon, though, never forgets to include intimate moments and details. Although each Avenger gets a heroic moment to shine, the film never loses sight of personal loss amid the spectacle. The film is also about self sacrifice, and people do perish in this film including a major character. Despite a 143 minute running time, the film is full of subplots and well-paced action, and every bit of the enormous, effects laden budget is on the big screen. The Avengers is perhaps not the best super hero film ever made, The Dark Knight being the apex, but it is the most complete, entertaining, multi-hero film to date. The question now is what do you do for an encore, and how can anyone hope to top let alone match this achievement? It would require the abilities of a James Cameron or Peter Jackson, or maybe studio executives can plead for Whedon's return. Let's hope so. (Do stay for the end credits for a double dose treat.)",9,1,4,16 May 2012
Angels & Demons," Angels and Demons-An Improvement
","Dan Brown's phenomenal bestseller, The DaVinci Code was made into an equally successful film adaptation. Angels and Demons, while actually a prequel to that book, has been adapted into a movie sequel, and the results are certainly more promising. Director Ron Howard and actor Tom Hanks reteam for a better telling of intrigue, murder, and suspense amid a historic and religious setting. Essentially an almost real-time thriller which jumps from ancient landmark to landmark, this film actually works pretty well within its own confines and is thus a satisfying entertainment without getting sidetracked on the holy mission of revelatory discovery and truth that its predecessor got tangled in.A scientific breakthrough in a Swiss laboratory generates powerful, anti-matter particles. When a mysterious group steals this deadly material, they threaten Vatican City with annihilation. The plot thickens when four Cardinals, in consideration to succeed the recently deceased Pope, are kidnapped and threatened with hourly execution at a holy site. Despite his purely scientific, empirical measure of the world, symbologist Robert Langdon (Tom Hanks with a normal hairdo this time) is whisked from Harvard campus to Vatican City where he is joined by Dr. Vittoria Vetra (Ayelet Zurer) whose lab created the stolen particles. Together, they attempt to locate the Cardinals and the anti-matter particles. We meet the Vatican Police guard and their protocols and protectiveness over not only the church and its members, but its archives which are at the heart of Langdon's quest for clues. The Pope's assistant, Camerlengo Patrick McKenna (Ewan McGregor), the Vatican Guard Commander Richter (Stellan Skarsgard), and elder Cardinal Strauss (Armin Mueller-Stahl) participate in the investigation. History (according to Dan Brown) has it that in 1668, four scientists or free-thinkers known as the Illuminati were kidnapped, branded and executed by the church. Now a darker version of the Illuminati is ready to exact an 'eye-for-an-eye' revenge on the church, and they intend to finish the job with one big bang of anti-matter. The clues lead to the four elements of fire, water, air and earth, and perhaps more. What do these have to with actual church locations? Complicating the proceedings is a mysterious assassin who carries out the lethal agenda with unerring accuracy even as Langdon, Dr. Vetra, and the police attempt to prevent further bloodshed. Should Vatican City be evacuated as thousands of people hold a vigil for the new Pope? Can everyone be trusted even in the most sensitive and elite of holy circles? These questions are raised as Langdon desperately searches for answers to save the Vatican.Having not read the original novel, I feel the film does work on its own which is more than can be said of its predecessor which got lost in self importance and confusing exposition. Screenwriters David Koepp (Jurassic Park, Spiderman) and Akiva Goldsman (A Beautiful Mind) have tried to streamline and condense Brown's immense, detailed novel into a serviceable story, which focuses on a race against time and is a pretty decent mystery without having the 'holier than thou' agenda. References are made to Langdon's previous adventure with The DaVinci Code, but the film wisely stays on course almost in actual-time so that the suspense level is ratcheted up progressively until the potentially explosive climax.There are some shortcomings to the film. There is a lot of material covered here so it seems a bit episodic, and plot details that beg for a more patient explanation are raced over. The characters are not sufficiently fleshed out to give more meaning to what happens later. All we get are some brief notes of each person's background to go forward; that is a missed opportunity. Perhaps Dan Brown's book did not give much in the way of detailed history for his players, but that does not excuse the filmmakers from trying to make a stronger, more emotional connection. Further, elements of the plot strain credibility, and you need to make a leap of faith so to speak to accept some pretty amazing coincidences and key events. In particular, the climax is full of major surprises and a stunning turn of events that require a suspension of disbelief.Production values are impressive particularly in the art direction and visual effects to recreate Vatican City (since permission for location shooting was denied). The camera work shows great fluidity, and seldom have visuals been more kinetic as in this film or for that matter any other recent adventure/mystery. This helps in the pacing and overall flow of the story.It's nice for a change to see male and female leads working together without resorting to the obligatory romance. Here, it's strictly business. In fact the film plays almost like a chapter of TV's 24 or The X Files which may determine whether the plot twists and turns are surprising or satisfyingly fresh to the uninitiated viewer. If you have seen The Godfather III, the storyline conspiracies may also seem a bit familiar. Still, you get the feeling that Howard and Hanks have gotten the hang of things this time around. What you get is a moderately interesting mystery in an elaborate, big budget setting. The visuals are impressive but the story itself is nothing special to write home about.",7,2,3,25 May 2009
Black Swan," Darkness at the Soul of BLACK SWAN
","Director Darren Aronofsky (The Wrestler, Requiem for a Dream) has done some offbeat films but has always elicited strong performances from his leads. Perhaps his greatest achievement is getting an Oscar worthy performance from Natalie Portman in Black Swan, a film that does an impressive job of depicting a psychological downward spiral of a competitive ballerina in the role of a lifetime.Nina Sayers (Portman) works hard at her craft and gets the coveted starring role in Swan Lake. Doted on by her mother (Barbara Hershey in an unusual role) and pushed to extremes by her ballet director, Thomas Leroy (Vincent Cassel), she begins to feel threatened and becomes delusional and loses touch with reality. A new arrival, Lily (Mila Kunis), understudies her and becomes not only her friend and night scene companion, but also her main competitor and threat. Is she undermining her on purpose or is Nina just imagining it all? As opening night approached, the visions become even more disturbing to the point that Nina is at the brink of her sanity and the curtain opens on the most important moment of her life.Portman projects a complex series of conflicting emotions including anxiety, jealousy, and even guilt as if she does not deserve the lead. Guided by Aronofsky, she soars as she has never done before. Not only does she perform a substantial amount of physically demanding ballet, but we see things through her eyes and feel her pains. Does she really commit the horrible acts she thinks she may have done or is it all in her warped mind? It's not a pleasant journey. There is extremely disturbing use of mirror images that reflect Nina's face and become Lily in the next instant in jarring and unexpected fashion. Is Nina seeing Lily or is it a reflection of her own self? A moment that shows the various pieces of wall art at her home coming alive in nightmarish figures is truly unnerving.Kunis as Lily brings enough menace to her role. Winona Ryder has a supporting role of a retiring, vindictive ballerina, Beth MacIntyre, who ends up in the hospital. A scene where Nina worships Beth is reminiscent of Anne Baxter and Bette Davis in the dressing room scene of All About Eve. Beth is bitter and even self abusive which kind of foreshadows what awaits Nina. Cassell is effective as the ballet director whose sexism and unusual methods are suspect but never his quest for the absolute best for his production. Hershey registers as an overly concerned, controlling mom.The film does a good job of showing the mental and physical toll that rehearsal and practice take on a performer, and to make matters worse, the angst exhibits itself seemingly on Nina's body in distorted and grotesque manifestations. The physical mutations would probably amuse and please the likes of David Cronenberg and David Lynch. As Leroy demands more than what she shows in technique, she knows she has to give everything in her soul and more to satisfy the ballet's demands. There is an interesting dichotomy showing two sides of a ballerina's psyche with the repressed, uptight Nina whose frigidity is counterpointed by the free spirited and sensual Lily. Lily evens brings out her sexuality and inner yearning that seems all too real, or is it a dream? Something that is never mentioned or shown is if Nina is a virgin or ever had a real boyfriend. Then there is the duality within Nina of White and Black Swans in which the dark side must emerge if she is to fully inhabit the lead role.Much of the film recalls other memorable films that bend reality like The Fight Club or Affliction, and Nina's descent into madness has striking similarities to Roman Polanski's classic Repulsion whose woman descends into psychological delusions and paranoia.Aronofsky's use of camera work is startling as it works in concert with Portman's performance, and when you see the change in her eyes near the end, it is stunning. The film employs lots of hand-held shots with cinematographer Matthew Libatique to visualize a subjective viewpoint for Nina. The score by Clint Mansell is well done with a touch of foreboding. Both of them are Aronofsky veterans. The final scene as Nina readies to perform the last act as she morphs into the Black Swan to complete her transformation is haunting. The final shot is unforgettable. Some viewers may be turned off by its repellent imagery but others will be astonished by a powerful depiction of madness at any price.",9,2,4,25 February 2011
Walk the Line," Johnny Cash is Humanized in WALK THE LINE
","It seems biographies of well known figures of the twentieth century have become an ever increasing source material for high drama (Ray, Beyond the Sea). Singer and songwriter Johnny Cash and his true love June Carter are realized by some honest, heartfelt performances and vivid period settings in Walk the Line. Directed by James Mangold (Girl Interrupted) from a screenplay by himself and Gill Dennis, the film draws material from autobiographies The Man in Black and Cash: An Autobiography. An impending concert by Johnny Cash at Folsom State Prison is the point the story begins as it flashes back to 1944 in the South where the struggling Cash family works on a plantation. As a young boy, Johnny idolizes his older brother Jack and wishes for something special in life. Their mother gives Johnny the love for singing hymns while their father (Robert Patrick) is an alcoholic, stern figure. When tragedy strikes the family, an emotional, dark cloud hangs over Johnny (Joaquin Phoenix) through the years even as he serves military duty in Germany and begins to find solace in writing music. He marries his sweetheart, Vivian (Ginnifer Goodwin), and the two have a family and struggle to stay afloat financially while Johnny tinkers with gospel music and forms a trio. When a fateful audition starts badly, he reverts to his more personal, angry music, and the rest is history. Johnny begins cutting records, dressing in his fabled black outfits, and touring with the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis Presley, and June Carter (Reese Witherspoon). Cash begins an infatuation and life long obsession for June who is also married at the time. Before long, Cash develops a dependency on drugs with unfortunate results. His career at a crossroads and his home life a shambles, he descends into a self-destructive path with only June Carter as his true love and salvation. Let's face it, the reason for seeing this film is to see how good the performances are by Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon, and they deliver the goods. There is definitely chemistry between the two especially in their duets as both of them show vocal abilities by singing their own songs (as in films like Coal Miner's Daughter and The Buddy Holly Story). It would require a strong actor to play a legend, and Phoenix proves to be adept. He gets his vocals in a deep, low range to the point you are convinced that he is young Johnny Cash! Kudos should also go to Witherspoon who also shows a gift for warbling with a country twang and acting all at once, not a feat to be taken lightly. Goodwin shines in her moments as the first Mrs. Cash, and it's a shame we don't see more of her in the film. The concert scenes are restaged with authenticity while simultaneously involving us with fluid close-ups and sharp cutting. It's nice to hear some famous songs recreated for today's audience. Even if you weren't a fan, the songs strike a memory chord regardless. Like Ray, Walk the Line shows how familial loss can have a lasting impact creatively and emotionally. The story manages to move ahead a few years at a time and important moments are rendered realistically. It is amusing in these pop music biographies to see a Who's Who of Rock n' Roll greats in their career infancies. Just seeing Cash pal around with the likes of Lewis, Presley, and others is fascinating. A lot of ground is covered in a little over two hours, but it doesn't feel too episodic. What the film captures successfully is the affect that his music had on prison inmates and how an overwhelming amount of his fan mail was attributed to prisoners who felt that he spoke to them. (Watch for a cameo by co-producer James Keach as the prison warden.) Cash was a man of the people, and the film takes great pains to show that Cash was not perfect and in fact very human. He succumbs to the temptations of female groupies, gets addicted to drugs, goes to prison, and shows peculiar behavior as he obsesses with June. Although he was smitten with her, Cash was instrumental in getting June into the spotlight to do solos and to stand equal with him. The film's momentum bogs down during Cash's downfall but redeems itself with scenes such as the Thanksgiving dinner in which Johnny confronts his father. Among the movie's few flaws is the failure to develop the strained relationship between Cash and his intimidating father (well played by Patrick), and the resolution of the film with its family reunion doesn't ring true as one would have liked. There is an amusing scene with June and her family scaring off a drug dealer who is trying to see Johnny. More scenes like that would have been welcome.There will naturally be constant comparisons with Ray, but that shortchanges a film that would shine in any year. OK, Ray might be a tad better and Coal Miner's Daughter is the gold standard, but Walk the Line does just fine and Phoenix is terrific.",8,0,1,14 December 2005
Captain Phillips," CAPTAIN PHILLIPS and His Captors
","Based on the real life story and book by Captain Richard Phillips, Captain Phillips is an authentic recreation of the events leading up to the hijacking of an American freighter ship on the high seas by modern day Somali pirates in 2009. Directed by Paul Greengrass (United 93, The Bourne Ultimatum), the film is a non-stop edge of your seat entertainment that puts you in the midst of a seemingly hopeless situation. Tom Hanks and a talented supporting cast bring the participants to life in one of the year's best films.Phillips is a responsible commander of a freighter with a small crew. As he boards his ship and readies to embark at sea, a group of Somali men prepares to search for nearby ships to board and hold hostage for money. As the freighter nears the Somali waters, the pirates give chase and the race is on as Phillips follows a series of procedures to elude and repel the invaders. When the pirates board and take control of the bridge by force, the dynamic has shifted to a hostage situation. As the Somali, who are smart and cautious, search the ship for other crew members, it becomes a tense game of cat and mouse. Led by Muse (Barkhad Abdi), the pirates want money even as US military forces come to the rescue. A tense standoff leads Phillips and his captors to the freighter's life boat and a race against time to save the brave captain.Phillips and his crew take creative steps to make this hijacking as difficult as possible. They even follow a protocol for securing the ship from boarders by running drills and taking extra precautions. Phillips himself proves resourceful even when alone with his captors by making innocent suggestions that have ulterior motives and meaning.The scene where the pirates take over the bridge is well shot and has a real time feel. Nobody shoots docudramas better than Greengrass with his rapid edits and hand-held cameras. He conveys a sense of progressively worsening desperation and hopelessness. Henry Jackman's score matches the intensity of the film.Like the concluding mission in Zero Dark Thirty, the final sequence here is meticulously detailed and ratchets the suspense to an unbearable level even though most people know how these events transpired. The play is the thing, and Greengrass executes the finale like a true, military SEAL operation complete with preparations and tactics. The climax is a brilliantly edited moment of split second timing, patience, and decisive action. It affects the audience on a visceral level where so much is at risk.Hanks (Saving Mr. Banks, Philadelphia) is completely convincing as Phillips. Abdi is authentic and menacing as Muse, all the more impressive since he was a total amateur when cast in the role. You even feel a bit of sympathy for Muse because he comes from a place of poverty where there are few options in life, and you come to realize that he is a person under extreme pressure from his bosses on the mainland. In fact, utilizing mostly unknowns aside from Hanks, works to the film's realism. The other Somali men are each given a chance to shine and have unique personas which makes what happens to them a shared experience.You also wonder how Phillips' wife and family are reacting to the crisis but you never see them despite Catherine Keener's brief role as his wife at the beginning. That could have raised the stakes a bit more emotionally.By the film's stunning resolution, there is an emotional release in Phillips that the audience shares. It is in these last several minutes that Hanks draws you into his heartbreaking trauma. It is here that he excels in an emotional performance in an emotional film, where a brave man said and did the right things under extreme duress.",9,0,1,1 March 2014
3:10 to Yuma," High Noon Time with 3:10 to Yuma
","Although the western film recently experienced a brief resurgence with Unforgiven, the number of quality ones has been few like Open Range. With the remake of the 1956 cult western, 3:10 to Yuma, (itself adapted from a short story by Elmore Leonard), the genre is primed for another comeback with this tense, well acted film.Set in the old west not long after the Civil War, a cattle rancher, Dan Evans (Christian Bale), and his family struggle to make a life for themselves as a local businessman threatens to foreclose on his property and make way for a railroad. His cattle are poached by outlaws led by Ben Wade (Russell Crowe) and his lieutenant, Charlie Prince (Ben Foster in a surly, effective performance). The criminals rob a money wagon (in a scene right out of Heat done western style) and stop at a local town. Wade is captured by local lawmen and is escorted to catch the Yuma prison train, which is hours away from arriving. Evans offers to join the group in return for some valuable reward money that will ultimately help his family's plight. Thus begins a tortuous journey that has potential repercussions for Evans' family and Wade's bid for freedom even as his gang is in pursuit. Will Evans and his motley crew get Wade to the railroad station in time and who will survive? Director James Mangold, fresh from his successful biopic, Walk the Line, again elicits strong performances from his two leads, Crowe and Bale. Crowe is everything we expect him to be, and his role is Oscar worthy. His outlaw is a cultured, Bible-quoting man who effuses an animal magnetism that is appealing to men and women. What is so satisfying here is that Bale is equally up to the task and really shines in a difficult, challenging role. The supporting cast is uniformly sharp with special nod to a grizzled, unrecognizable Peter Fonda as a tough bounty hunter. Logan Lerman is effective as Evans' older son who is ashamed of and gradually realizes a growing respect for his father. Luke Wilson has an amusing bit role as a corrupt railroad hand.The film has a plot similar to the 1950's westerns High Noon and Last Train from Gun Hill, and encompasses elements of the classic western formula, namely the cattleman versus the railroad; only in this case, it is used as a jumping off point to a deeper, more psychological conflict. This is really a movie about what motivates people to do what they do. Most of the dialogue involves Wade's hurling insults and quips at a stoic Evans. We can see that Wade has a respect and growing admiration for Evans' seemingly hopeless quest, and the emerging facts have a strong bearing on what is to come. We learn about Wade's childhood and about what truly guides Evans' reasons for taking such a risky mission. His role in the Union Army during the Civil War comes to the fore. And how did he get his leg maimed? These shades of background and characterization enrich an already tense and interesting plot. The memorable ending, which pushes credibility just a tad, truly tests each man's resolve and sense of justice.Production values are strong with beautiful cinematography by Phedon Papamichael (Walk the Line, The Pursuit of Happiness). The film moves at a deliberate, methodical pace (editor Michael McCusker) and is never boring. It gets to the conflict fairly quickly and reaches its finale, an agonizing chase across town that is quite exciting and riveting right to the startling end.Make no mistake, this is a film that western enthusiasts will love while those who appreciate a strong, tense character study will find much to savor. Although we expect gold performances from Crowe and the ever maturing Bale (hard to believe this was the boy in Spielberg's Empire of the Sun), it is Mangold's prowess in that delicate balance of critically acclaimed, popular film-making, that may become a major force in Hollywood for years to come.",8,2,4,13 September 2007
Skyfall," Bond's Triumphant Return in SKYFALL
","Daniel Craig made an impressive debut as Ian Fleming's super spy James Bond in Casino Royale, but its followup, Quantum of Solace, was a marked drop off which threatened to derail the franchise. Enter director Sam Mendes (American Beauty), a well honed script (Neal Purvis, Robert Wade, and John Logan), and a dream cast. The result is a well acted, emotionally compelling adventure thriller that takes the formula and rips it open to expose Agent 007 as we've never seen before. It is also one of the best films of the year and certainly one of the very best Bond films.British secret service agent James Bond (Daniel Craig) and fellow operative Eve (Naomie Harris) are in pursuit of a killer who has stolen a hard drive containing the names of all NATO agents imbedded in terrorist groups. A fateful decision by MI6 boss M (Judi Dench) leads to Bond being put out of commission. While M is being leveraged into retirement by her supervisor (Ralph Feinnes) and Bond has lost his edge, a mysterious figure (Javier Bardem) from M's past begins a reign of cyber terror and revenge. As agent 007 struggles with his future and his loyalties to M, he must look to his past to reconcile his biggest challenge. There are obvious comparisons to The Dark Knight Rises with a fallen hero searching for his 'mojo'. Most Bond films operated superficially and featured unusual characters, and with rare exceptions (On Her Majesty's Secret Service and of course the more recent Casino Royale) did we delve into the personal side. While early incarnations of the super agent showed him nearly invincible, this Bond is a more humanized reinvention without emasculating its hero. For the first time, Craig's Bond has a sense of humor with puns and quips (a staple of the earlier films). In fact, much of the dialogue is sharp. By delving into the core relationships, the filmmakers have added layers and twists to a conventional formula. The main themes center on loyalty, sins of the past, and tradition clashing with the new order. There are parallels between Bond and M as relics of an age gone by and between Bond and his doppelganger as direct opposites. This is Dench's showcase as M. Although her allegiance to Bond was a recurring theme in the previous two films with Craig, never before has her character been shown in such depth. After seven Bond films, her M has gone from background to foreground as a primary plot point, and she does not disappoint. There is a nice buildup to Bardem's entrance whose psychological motives are questionable including his sexuality. This is not your father's Bond villain. As Silva, a man with a dark past whose methods are bold and brazen, Bardem instills a decided creepiness and cunning that is refreshing. Think of Bardem's character as the black sheep of a dysfunctional family with M in the maternal role. A strong supporting cast includes Ben Whishaw as the new quartermaster Q, a young computer whiz who represents the new breed of spy, Bérénice Marlohe as a stunning beauty who holds the key to her dangerous employer, and Harris in a pivotal role. With splendid global locations (Istanbal, Shanghai, and Scotland), this may be the most beautifully shot Bond film (Roger Deakins) since You Only Live Twice. Some scenes are visual standouts like a sultry shower rendezvous and a moment of hand-to-hand combat all done in shadows and silhouette. In this age of 24, Jason Bourne, and Homeland, the stakes are much higher in depicting realistic action and techie scenes, and Skyfall holds its own with solid set pieces including a subway bombing and a tense climax with echoes of Straw Dogs. There are specific references to the Bond canon including the reappearance of a certain iconic car. It is remarkable how current, top directors have been directly influenced or inspired by these movies. Steven Spielberg did the Indiana Jones movies as homage to Bond films and even cast former Bond, Sean Connery, as Indy's dad! James Cameron did his take on a super spy with True Lies. Christopher Nolan filmed an entire sequence in Inception as tribute to Bond. David Fincher's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has Bond style, opening credits; (Skyfall has terrific credits and a sultry, throwback theme song by Adele). Even Quentin Tarantino suggested several years ago that the Bond films needed to get gritty and basic; think the filmmakers took notice? As J.J. Abrams' Star Trek and Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins showed, a classic franchise can be reinvented or updated while reaping enormous dividends. With the most touching finale to a Bond film, there are big surprises and a distinct familiarity by film's end that sets the series for a grand run. For Bond purists, this is uncharted territory, but by 'shaking' up the mythology, Bond's story has become 'stirring'.",8,1,10,5 December 2012
Iron Man 3," IRON MAN 3 Stands Alone
","Following on the heels of one of the greatest superhero films (The Avengers) ever, Iron Man 3 had the daunting task of being the first film to initiate Phase 2 of the next set of Marvel films. Add to that the fact that third acts rarely do well in these individual film series (Spiderman 3, X-Men 3). Directed this time by Shane Black, (former director Jon Favreau still plays bodyguard Happy Hogan), there was every reason to believe that this installment would fall short of expectations. Surprisingly, this film is pretty good and benefits from a strong plot and the usual Robert Downey Jr. performance. By keeping the audience guessing, this action packed film not only kick starts the next set of films in the Marvel plan, but sets new expectations going forward in the series.Tony Stark (Downey) has been traumatized by his near death experience in The Avengers with a little help from his friends and must contend with trying to find some normalcy in his life, and that includes his relationship with girlfriend Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow). Stark recalls a past relationship with a female scientist, whose potentially revolutionary, regenerative process called Extremis is found to have explosive side effects. At the same time, a young genius name Aldrich (Guy Pierce) proposes an idea for high tech think tank, Advanced Idea Mechanics (A.I.M.), which will later have severe implications. Further, a terrorist named The Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) is hijacking the airwaves and threatening catastrophic events. Are these events related? The story takes Stark out of his comfort zone and drops him in a nowhere town in Tennessee, and he is thus forced to improvise, relying upon his skills and wit to battle a formidable opponent while forging an unlikely bond with a local boy. A deadly, convoluted plot begins to take shape which has far reaching consequences to not only Stark's home but the world.Downey owns this character, and he gets nice support from Paltrow in an expanded role. Pierce makes a worthy antagonist with tricks up his sleeve so to speak, and Kingsley is a hoot playing up his mysterious role as The Mandarin. Paul Bettany again amusingly voices Stark's computer Jarvis.Shane Black's talent was notable in the screenplay for Lethal Weapon, and it shows in the dialogue especially between Stark and Pepper and his interactions with the boy. He also was astute enough to challenge his main character by stripping him of his closest allies (no sign of S.H.I.E.L.D either) and his armor and stranding him in the middle of nowhere.What set Marvel characters apart from most other super hero comics was that they experienced real, personal problems, and that, combined with a real threat, formed an emotional response from the audience. It's nice for comic book fans to see the Marvel films incorporate the established comic book lore including A.I.M. and pushing the ante on supporting characters like Colonel Rhodes (Don Cheadle) as The Iron Patriot. At times you feel a bit of James Bond influence and then a bit of The X-Files which is not bad thing. There are some clever plot twists and unexpected surprises in characters including one revelation that may upset some comic book purists. The standout highlight is a spectacular action sequence in midair as Air Force One is attacked and its passengers are thrown out helplessly. What's a superhero to do? The result is a terrific, beautifully shot maneuver that raises hairs. Then there is that magnificent armor that Start is constantly perfecting to the point that he can remotely get suited up by sections. Special visual effects are top of the line as witnessed in the pyrotechnic climax at a shipyard.Not content to paint by numbers, Black and Downey have fashioned an entertaining, superior third film that is almost as good as Iron Man 1. There's a certain finality in the way it ends which makes one wonder how will they do another Iron Man film. This is Downey's last contractual Iron Man for now and it would be a shame to deny fans another go at a fascinating character especially with The Avengers 2 in the not too distant horizon. And yes, do stay through the lengthy credits for a brief but amusing scene and cameo.",8,0,2,27 May 2013
Finding Neverland," Believe in Finding Neverland
","If you truly believe, anything is possible, and that sums up the theme of Finding Neverland, a wonderful, emotional journey of the heart. Suggested by actual events at the turn of the century in England, the story follows James M. Barrie, the man who would go on to write Peter Pan. How he got to that creative place serves as the fascinating backdrop to a story about people who are drawn together and bond amid interesting circumstances.There is a bull's eye performance by Johnny Depp as Barrie who by chance meets a widow Sylvia Davies (enchanting Kate Winslet) and her four young sons who have recently lost their father from cancer. A younger son, Peter, is the focal point of the growing relationship between Barrie and the family. Barrie's childlike fascination with the magic of believing and the innocence of children is a recurring theme. At his summer cottage, he develops the story and characters that will ultimately become Peter Pan. An added subplot is Barrie's own marriage which is in the throes of deterioration. As the plot reaches its finale, Peter Pan, the play is ready for its premiere and real-life relationships mature.Despite a slow, deliberately paced beginning, the film manages to deposit bits of layers of feeling, motivation and pathos that by film's end result in a mountain of emotion and connection. There is indeed a magical feeling of wanting to believe amid the love Barrie feels for his adopted family. The feelings are not unlike the end of Field of Dreams or Big Fish, and that's a good thing. The final frame is not easily forgotten. How dare Miramax produce an intelligent film that has no violence, profanity, or sex? Even the screenplay is well written (Allan Knee and David Magee) with memorable lines that ring true. Production values are strong including crisp cinematography and period costume/set designs. The film looks like 1903 without being in your face. The pacing is very deliberate and steady, and there is nice intercutting of Barrie's real world and his interspersed fantasy world. Johnny Depp underplays the role of Barrie in a measured, subtle way without losing sight of the creative, unique self who stirred his creative juices and shared his vision with those closest to him. Constantly fascinating to watch, Depp has moments which recall his previous roles in Ed Wood and Pirates of the Caribbean. He is hitting his stride as a strong lead and acting force, and Oscar nominations are waiting for him and others in the cast. Kate Winslet is good as always and has had a great one-two punch this year with The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. There is droll support from Dustin Hoffman as a theater producer who is given the best throwaway lines including a cute reference to his past role as Captain Hook in Spielberg's Hook. An older Julie Christie registers a strong supporting performance as Winslet's stern mother who dislikes Barrie's influence on her family. Special mention should go to Freddie Highmore who is terrific as the young Peter whose namesake serves as the title Barrie's masterpiece.2004 is shaping up to be the year of the biopics what with De-Lovely, Ray, Beyond the Sea, Alexander, Kinsey, and Vera Drake among others. It would be safe to say that Finding Neverland is not only one of the best biography films but also one of the best films of the year. (Just be patient and let the magic do its work.)",Null,0,0,9 November 2004
Kung Fu Panda," The Wisdom of KUNG FU PANDA
","Looking for an animated film that the whole family can watch and enjoy? Then the summer has a good selection in Kung Fu Panda, a magical tale of talking animals, martial arts, eastern philosophy, and good versus evil. It is also voiced by several well known stars not the least of which is the force of nature that is Jack Black.Panda bear Po (Jack Black) works for his father's noodle business in ancient China but yearns for something more. His interest in martial arts leads him to being an accidental selection as the 'chosen one' to defend the local town from a vengeful leopard Tai Lung (Ian McShane), a former student of the wise, martial arts teacher, Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). As the 'chosen one', Po is given the sacred Dragon Scrolls and is trained by Shifu in the ways and technique of Kung Fu much to the consternation of the Furious Five, the current crop of warriors. Po presents the ultimate challenge both physically and mentally to Shifu until the master hits on an unorthodox idea. As Tai Lung approaches and the Furious Five attempt to defend the town, Po must learn the ways of the true warrior. As he begins to mature and learn about himself, he becomes the last line of defense.This story nicely blends serious themes with moments of comedic fun. What is refreshing in the humor is that it is organic and timeless without resorting to pop references (as in Shrek)-no small feat. It also depicts the ancient Chinese warriors with not only martial arts prowess, but abilities to defy gravity as in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Children will find a wondrous, far away land populated by real people in the guise of animal characters. It is a believable world with real feelings of yearning, tradition, envy, and bravery.A somewhat more subdued Jack Black does a fine job emoting and realizing the young Po. Dustin Hoffman is quite good as the wise sage, a sort of Asian Yoda (or the other way around). It's rather hard to believe the star power behind the other voices including Angelina Jolie, Jackie Chan, and Seth Rogen. The movie could have worked just as well without them.The movie actually gets better in the middle and toward the end, not that long a wait. Its basic themes of destiny and loyalty are universal. As Master Shifu says, 'there are no accidents.' The animation and creative use of camera angles and zooms are breath taking at times. You kind of wish the script had just a bit more substance and this would have become a treasured classic. As it is, Kung Fu Panda is a delightful, inoffensive adventure with something for all ages.",7,2,5,23 June 2008
Gravity," GRAVITY Soars
","Some films (Castaway, 127 Hours) have a simple premise, a basic tale of survival, devoid of large casts and complicated plot lines. Co-written with his son Jonás Cuarón, director and co-writer Alfonso Cuarón (Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, Y Tu Mamá También) has combined state of the art technology and remarkable acting by Sandra Bullock in a spectacular, tension-filled adventure, Gravity.American astronauts Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) and Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), work on repairs to the Hubble space telescope as news of a nearby Russian satellite explosion is reported. The quiet serenity is suddenly displaced by hurtling debris that decimates the repair mission and causes great damage to the telescope and more. Caught up in a life threatening disaster and stranded in space without any hope of rescue, the two must improvise and utilize survival skills to survive under impossible circumstances. As hope fades and oxygen running low, the astronauts must make difficult choices to make it home alive. Caurón successfully conveys the emptiness and vastness of space and how isolated it can be. What is remarkable is that this film could not have been made so convincingly until now because of recent technological developments. Even director James Cameron (Avatar), who was consulted early on, championed the film's ambitions for space realism that was years in the making. A ground breaking achievement in visual effects, not since Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey or Apollo 13 has a film so realistically depicted space travel. Even the realistic use of sound or lack of it enhances the authenticity. Great care and research obviously went into the production. The film boldly starts with a continuous panning shot for thirteen minutes with nary a cut. When was the last time a major Hollywood film did that? There are some remarkable shots in space like the one instance where Bullock is in a womb-like position which acts as a metaphor of life. Gravity deserves to be seen in 3D (perhaps the best 3D film since Avatar) which opens up the magnitude of the visual effects. When did any 3D film show a person's tears? This one does. The realism and emptiness of space will be hard to match so convincingly in future films. Cuarón establishes a basic premise and creates a major conflict while continually upping the ante of impending danger. The suspense is palpable as we feel as if we are there with Bullock and must figure a way to first get out of harm's way and then to go home to earth. The one film this reminds you of is Marooned. This is Bullock's (The Blind Side) show all the way as you feel her fears amid every threat; she is in virtually every shot. We learn to understand her feelings and get a glimpse into her past about her regrets in life. Paradoxically, space becomes a place to escape her past or prove to be her death. One major theme for her character is learning to let go whether it be a painful past memory or letting go of something in the here and now. It's about finding a reason to live and finding a deeply personal redemption under the most trying circumstances. Clooney lends strong support as her veteran colleague and voice of reason who offers instructions and calm amid tragedy. You will never guess who voices mission control, but here's a hint- see Apollo 13.Sure, despite convenient coincidences that facilitate some plot points and a couple situations that are a bit hard to believe, Bullock sells it with her conviction and desperation; you buy into the situation regardless even if it may be hallucination or a dream. What should be noteworthy is the fact that Gravity is rated PG in an era when PG13 and R rated major releases dominate the marketplace. And it runs a lean 90 minutes. How such a simple tale of survival and hope becomes not only totally engaging but such a compelling, landmark work of cinema is the lasting legacy of Gravity.",10,7,10,1 March 2014
Star Trek," Star Trek Redux Exhilerates
","Continuing the trend of reinventing sixties iconic figures such as Batman and James Bond, Star Trek was inevitably next in line. For those who fretted that the new incarnation of creator Gene Roddenberry's beloved franchise of 'Wagon Train to the Stars' would be dishonored or ignored, they needn't worry. This new version, intended to reboot the franchise that was so popular in TV reruns and subsequently in a series of big budget films, is a remarkably balanced take on the origins of the classic Enterprise crew. It is designed to appeal to the non-initiated audience while referencing the existing canon of Star Trek lore. Director J. J. Abrams (Fringe, Alias, Mission Impossible III) brings a fresh vision abetted by Trekkie fan/writers, Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman.James T. Kirk is born as his father rescues a starship crew during a Romulan attack led by the mysterious Nero (Eric Bana). A young rebel who grows into a brash, thrill seeking adventurer, young Kirk (Chris Pine) is recruited into Star Fleet Academy by Captain Christopher Pike (Bruce Greenwood). Meanwhile the half Vulcan / half human Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) has matured amid bullying kids and decides his destiny lies with The Federation as a cadet instead of his home planet Vulcan. Kirk strikes up a friendship with an ornery young Doctor Leonard McCoy (Karl Urban is a hoot) whose distrust of space and things not medical will become legendary. It is McCoy who devises a way for Kirk to become a crew member of the newly commissioned starship Enterprise. In fact, most of what will become the core crew is assembled including communications officer Uhura (Zoe Saldana), helmsmen Sulu (John Cho) and Chekov (Anton Yelchin), and later, engineer Scotty (Simon Pegg). Seeking vengeance against the Federation, Nero has traveled through time to exact pain and destruction with a planet killing device that will draw the Enterprise to Vulcan and ultimately Earth. With the Universe in the balance, Kirk and Spock must decide if they can work together (with the help of a certain mentor).The parallel life paths of Kirk and Spock are marked contrasts of two men who will clash and reconcile their future relationship. Kirk smacks of hawkish, shoot-from-the-hip reactionary while Spock is the logical, think-inside-the-box good soldier. Nero reminds us a bit of Khan from Wrath of Khan. The character of Uhura is a major upgrade. She is a multi-talented officer who has romantic longings for a certain Vulcan. Greenwood shines as the veteran Pike. Leonard Nimoy makes a welcome, pivotal appearance as an elder Spock who figures prominently in the history that is to come. The cast makes the most of iconic roles and excels at recreating the personas of what we remember; each crew member gets an opportunity to shine. It is nice to see this group working and improvising together for the first time to solve a crisis. Further, this story takes it for granted as does its audience that this crew is not only multicultural, but multi-species, a far cry from the novelty of the integrated crew of classic Trek.The screenplay has some well written dialogue and clever Trek references sprinkled throughout, and age old lines of the classic show are introduced for the first time. When McCoy utters, 'I'm a doctor, not a physicist', it's a riot. Part of the fun is watching two heavyweights like Kirk and Spock faceoff and slowly bond and seeing how Kirk ascends to the captain's chair. We finally get to learn what the 'Kobayashi Maru' wargame really is and how Kirk manages to defeat the test.Sure, the plot has some gaping holes if you think about continuity and the fate of a certain venerable, classic character. Nero's motives are explained in time, but they don't make total sense. This film also does not have the gravitas of deep themes as previous films which is perhaps its only true failing, but instead, we get a strong character study that more than compensates.Technical effects are quite impressive although Abrams seems to favor close-ups and tight camera setups that put the viewer in the middle of action scenes. Fortunately, there are no jarring Cloverfield hand-held camera moves. There is a good fight sequence on a weapons platform and a surprise on an ice planet. You want phasers shooting back and forth in space battle? You've got them here. In fact the energy level keeps this voyage bouncing along.The Enterprise is stunning-it has never looked quite this way ever, and it is cool how they depict the starship going into warp drive. There are imaginative points of view when showing off the ship's exterior, and the interior is brimming with activity and sound, which is in stark contrast to the more antiseptic views from the earlier show. The costumes (complete with female miniskirts) harken back to that period and yet seem fresh. At credits' end, there is a nice dedication to the Roddenberrys, Gene and Majel Barrett (who voices the Federation computer one last time).Fans of the old show may tear up at how faithful and creative Abrams and his screenwriters are with Trek lore and how they set everything up nicely going forward. This is their alternate universe now, and we are game for the experience. This crew, baptized under fire, is ready for new missions, and they cannot come soon enough. Way to go, Mr. Abrams. This Trek rocks! ***1/2 of **** stars",9,4,12,13 May 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Tarantino Reinvents War in INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS
","Quentin Tarantino has been working on this World War II script for many years, and what is ostensibly a revenge film with moments of terrific dialogue and parallel subplots is a bit undone with untidy displays of violence and a fantasy denouement. Nevertheless, the play is the thing and few writer/directors could fashion such an entertaining if mean spirited film like Inglourious Basterds with bravura performances particularly by Christoph Waltz as a most charming and lethal Nazi.Once upon a time during World War II a French man is questioned about the whereabouts of local French Jews by a polite German SS officer, Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) whose silky, sinister approach gets remarkable, deadly results from which one teenage French girl barely escapes.Next we meet Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt giving a Chad Everett by way of Clark Gable impression) who has recruited Jewish soldiers to hunt down and terrorize the Nazis in an Apache Indian way. Any survivors do not escape unscathed but have a Swastika cross carved into their foreheads, their mark for life.In 1944, a young French woman, Emmanuelle, owns a movie theater and is wooed by a German war hero, Fredrick, whose film, Nation's Pride, is premiering in Paris. Fredrick gets Joseph Goebbels, head of German Propaganda to move the premiere to Emmanuelle's smaller theater. She is in fact the young French girl (Shosanna) who escaped a massacre and is plotting to take revenge by killing all the Nazi attendees.At the same time, British Lt. Archie Hicox is sent to meet a double agent in France and, with Raine's men, attend the Nation's Pride premiere to blowup the theater and kill high level Nazis including Hitler. Hicox meets the agent who is a famous German actress, Bridget von Hammersmark (Diane Kruger is glamorous) in a basement café. German soldiers and an SS officer complicate things, and a Mexican standoff ensues with explosive results. Having to alter plans, Raine substitutes himself and the surviving Basterds into the mission.At the premiere, as head of security, Col. Landa discovers the Allied plot, and Raine is arrested and interrogated in another building. There, Landa makes a startling proposal even as Emmanuelle plots to ignite the film nitrate stored in her theater and the other 'basterds' in the audience execute their part of the plan. Seemingly spared the finale at the theater and having manipulated his own fate, Col. Landa and Lt. Raine have a day of reckoning.The usual Tarantino touches are here including excruciating scenes with gunshots, scalpings, stabbings, and bat beatings. The film is structured in five chapters, and his love for movies is evident in references to German cinema icons, and, no doubt, major filmic influences from The Dirty Dozen (especially in the recruitment scene and the high octane finale), Where Eagles Dare, and any number of spaghetti westerns. Imaginative use is made of fluid camera movement and rapid edits.While the cast is in fine form with Til Schweiger as a Charles Bronson-type, director Eli Roth as the Bear Jew, and Mélanie Laurent, radiant as the haunted Emmanuelle, the standout is Waltz. Pitt is a hoot as Raine (whose name is a play on actor Aldo Ray), and when he tries to spout Italian phrases, it is outrageous. Veteran Rod Taylor and comedian Mike Myers have fleeting cameos.Some criticism of the film is warranted. Infamous figures get killed at the premiere; if you are going to rewrite history even in a fable, don't take something that is so ingrained as to make an utter mockery of it. Also, any sympathetic characters pretty much go out the window, so don't get too attached to anyone.No Tarantino film would be complete without wonderfully written set pieces especially the one in the basement café that is very reminiscent of the final standoff in Reservoir Dogs. While his words are sublime and he is adept at setting up such scenes, he does not take full advantage of the possibilities of others which are given relatively short shrift like the arrest of Raine and the confrontation of Bridget by Col. Landa.For fans of the talented director, this one is a must, but for the average moviegoer, the snappy screenplay may not be fully appreciated in the overall context of an entertaining story that drips a bit too much blood. Two things are for sure: A glass of milk will never seem the same again, and Brad Pitt looks fabulous in a white tuxedo.",8,0,5,5 March 2010
Iron Man 2," IRON MAN 2 The Same Man
","After a spectacular start with Iron Man a couple summers ago, one would have hoped for an even better sequel, considering the fortunes of the Spiderman, X Men, and Batman franchises of late, whose sophomore efforts took their series to dizzying new heights. Not so here, although Iron Man 2 is definitely not a step down either. Consider it on par with the original film and as such, a pretty entertaining, well made Marvel Comics screen entry, and it boasts another strong performance by Robert Downey, Jr. as the hero.Picking up where industrialist genius, Tony Stark, reveals himself to be Iron Man, the folks in Washington D.C., namely the military and Congress want the technology. He defies the Senate panel by declaring the armor as private property that has brought world peace. Stark's competitor, Justin Hammer (Sam Rockwell) is desperate to claim the military's approval for armored weaponry. Stark's main girl, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) is trying to help him run Stark Enterprises despite Tony's childish antics and thrill seeking. His buddy, Lt. Col. Jim Rhodes (Don Cheadle taking over for Terrence Howard), is under pressure by the military to get the Iron Man technology. A new assistant, Natalie Rushman (Scarlett Johansson), has a mysterious background. All this as Starks' blood is beginning to get poisoned by his ebbing, artificial heart.Enter the Russian, Ivan Vanko (Mickey Rourke), whose father was snubbed by Stark's dad. He has developed a body armor that has electric whips, while Hammer provides him the resources to exact revenge. Stark must come to terms with the distant relationship with his late father as he desperately searches for an answer to his failing heart. As Hammer presents his new military hardware to an audience, Ivan and Tony engage in a battle royal.What the filmmakers needed to do (and could have done a bit more) was to let Downey carry the film on his shoulders; he's certainly earned the right to flex his acting muscles after Iron Man. Here, he shows off his flair for being a bad boy whose arrogance is matched by his tech savvy, and he is a hero confronting his inner demons and pain which are directly related to the fallout with his father. It is interesting how poppa Stark is portrayed in newsreel footage as a kind of Industrial version of Walt Disney complete with a topographic industrial plan instead of a theme park.Downey and Paltrow have good repartee and a smooth chemistry even when they argue. The dialogue is snappy and at times funny courtesy of screenwriter Justin Theroux (Tropic Thunder) and director Jon Favreau who still knows how to convey the fantasy world of super heroes, and there are enough twists and surprises to keep things humming along.Rourke is sufficiently menacing as Ivan, spouting Russian and a dark, defiant persona. Samuel Jackson repeats as Nick Fury, the head of S.H.I.E.L.D., a secret organization that is attempting to assemble 'The Avengers Initiative'. Johansson is on screen too briefly but there is a nice payoff where she comes through in fine form, or should I say fighting form. As a US Senator, comedian Garry Shandling is stunt casting but proves a bit of a distraction; you just can't take his character seriously. Marvel co-creator Stan Lee makes another brief cameo, and Favreau is amusing in a larger supporting role of Happy Hogan.Special effects are impressive and ably serve the story. That suit of armor still wows and functions in true comic book form. There is a familiar, circular prop that appears in a crucial scene that Marvel fans will want to note! Stunt work and the fight choreography that involves Johansson's character is fun to watch but you wish there were more.Favreau has shown a knack for comic heroes, but he has not made the big step to improve on his franchise. Perhaps in Iron Man 3 he can break the curse that has plagued super hero franchises that fell down in their third films. By the way, do stay after the credits for an interesting clip that hints at the ever growing Marvel Universe.",8,1,2,17 May 2010
World War Z," World War Z Takes Zombies to a New Level
","Brad Pitt has gone from youthful sex symbol to versatile actor and producer. His biggest project to date is this filmic adaptation of Max (Mel's son) Brooks' novel, World War Z, chronicling a massive, worldwide zombie apocalypse. For a subgenre that has ranged from classic horror, (Night of the Living Dead), to science fiction, (Resident Evil), to modern updates, (Dawn of the Dead remake), and parodies, (Zombieland and Shaun of the Dead), this film represents a rare depiction of the zombie invasion as a global, mass annihilation. Previously, these films focused on a small group of survivors (TV's The Walking Dead) with a news blackout and no idea as to the magnitude of the infection. After publicized problems with the screenplay and director Mark Forster's (Monsters Ball, Finding Neverland) rough cut (particularly a climactic battle scene), a new ending was shot, and the result is a remarkably engaging film. Gerry (Brad Pitt) and his wife, Karin (Mireille Enos), ready their two daughters for school and get caught in a traffic jam in downtown Philadelphia. Suddenly all hell breaks loose and panic sets in amid an invasion of zombies who are bent on mindlessly attacking and converting humans into the undead. As cities fall worldwide, the infection spreads exponentially with startling speed as the family flees to Newark for supplies and a lifeline from Gerry's former UN boss, but while the family finds a brief refuge aboard a US Navy ship, Gerry is called into service to find the source of the infection or risk having his family kicked off the ship as non-essential personnel. Tracking down random clues across the globe in such disparate locales as South Korea, Israel, and Wales, the trail for a cause and potential cure proves challenging as time runs out on humanity. In many ways, this film, which shares much in common with pandemic tales as Contagion, Outbreak, and The Andromeda Strain, is more a thriller than horror, and that's not a bad thing. Rather than relying on gross out murders and graphic blood spattered effects, this film looks at the bigger picture without sacrificing the more intimate moments of sheer terror, not an easy balance. Don't let that PG13 rating fool you! Some scenes are suspenseful and agonizing as the threat of zombies is ever present. The film, particularly in the Newark apartment scenes and an unbearable moment of truth at a World Health Organization lab, is like one big funhouse ride where the scares are just around the corner. Other memorable set pieces include the opening pandemonium in Philly, which is well crafted and builds to an alarming level, a walled in city of Jerusalem stunningly challenged by a growing sea of undead, and perhaps the best moment, a horrifying passenger plane flight from hell that starts innocently enough but quickly devolves into an impossible situation.The film takes the scary notion of fast running zombies from 28 Days Later and adds even more lethal traits as in their ability to not only swarm like insects, but to hurl themselves with great ferocity at their intended victims even through car windshields. Their victims aren't devoured as in other films, but rather a bite turns them into more zombies almost instantaneously. They are also real sensitive to sound as Gerry learns at the worst possible moment.What distinguishes this film above most others is its smarts. The script, while written by many hands, still shows an intelligent approach to a devastating crisis, and the dialogue never sounds phony. Further, the film is like one big mystery with nature's clues in full view waiting for Gerry to piece together a solution. Some of the plot points are a bit open ended and push the limits of plausibility, but things move so swiftly and convincingly, that most won't mind. The supporting cast is effective in brief roles with a strong turn by Daniella Kertesz as a soldier. But this is Pitt's show, and he is the right leading man who has the presence and charisma to carry even a zombie film. Being able to improvise and display cool under pressure, he is the ideal savior that the world needs. Perhaps his Gerry is guilty of being too perfect, but he does it so well.(It is amusing to note that Gerry and his family become guardians of an orphaned boy, and one wonders if Angelina Jolie was smiling at the parallels with her and Pitt's real life, nuclear family.)With a mega-budgeted production, the CG effects are a standout especially when creating the hoards of zombies, and there are many effective camera shots with some particularly startling, overhead views. There is also great use of sound effects that add to the visceral chills while the brooding, pulsing music score (Marco Beltrami) complements the tension. A thrill ride from beginning to end, World War Z is a thoroughly entertaining, scary epic that takes the zombie lore and heightens the stakes with an impressive budget and a star turn by an actor/producer at the top of his game.",9,7,17,26 June 2013
The Hunger Games," The Bloodsport of THE HUNGER GAMES
","A mega-best selling trilogy by Suzanne Collins has spawned this first installment, The Hunger Games, adapted by Collins, Billy Ray, and director Gary Ross for the big screen as a satisfying adventure thriller featuring a terrific performance by budding superstar, Jennifer Lawrence. The film avoids the pitfalls of previous best-sellers turned into films that lacked a sound structure for the uninitiated readers (as in The Da Vinci Code); it works quite well for newbies. The filmmakers have kept the main storyline compelling and emotional within the framework of an action film.In the not too distant future, a group of twelve districts has been punished for 74 years for a failed rebellion. Each year, they must participate in a random lottery or 'reaping' of their youth for a lethal competition, a fight to the death with only one winner. The games are grand, lavish events that are in essence, public executions in the guise of entertainment. There are specific rules and boundaries except when they suit the whims of the game masters. Food, weapons, and supplies are made available but not without an accompanying danger, and there are sponsors who can provide life saving assistance and support in timely ways.In one district, Katniss (Lawrence) is a teenage girl who is good with a bow and arrow and dotes after her younger sister, Primrose, and their mother. She is close to a boy, Gale (Liam Hemsworth), who has strong feelings for her. When Primrose and a boy, Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), are chosen for reaping, it sets off a surprising series of events including a desperate sacrifice by Katniss as the chosen few must train for their lives in a competition that is televised nationwide. The contestants are feted like celebrities and are mentored by a former survivor named Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) with support from Cinnas (Lenny Kravitz effective in a brief role). When these modern day gladiators are released into the wild, loyalties are tested and survival instincts take over, and a grand spectacle is replaced by a grim fate that awaits all but one survivor.Director Ross (Seabiscuit) knows how to tell a good story and he is aided immensely by a strong cast that melds newcomers with seasoned veterans like Harrelson, Wes Bentley, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland. Special mention goes to Elizabeth Banks as a macabre emcee. Lawrence (Winter's Bone) shines in a physically demanding role, but she never shortchanges her ability to show feelings and angst in a convincing way. You root for her and feel her pain. Her portrayal of Katniss has a genuine decency and soul which, despite the savage nature of the games, reveals her humanity for the world to see. Might her actions and deeds register among the masses and have far reaching consequences? This brave new world of deadly sport (that plays like a perverted version of TV's Survivor), is authentically realized by impressive set designs and costumes which contrast two disparate worlds-a pauper class of citizens and the gaudy elite. If much of this film's storyline sounds familiar, it draws from pop culture sources as Shirley Jackson's short story, The Lottery, and films like The Most Dangerous Game, The Truman Show, and The Running Man. Even elements of Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 and George Orwell's 1984 come to mind with its oppressed societies and ever watchful video screens, and when cannon fire signals a fallen victim, it echoes moments from Capricorn One. The sacrificial humans are dubbed 'tributes', a contradiction of terms not unlike Orwellian propaganda and its mixed meanings e.g. 'War is Peace'.While The Hunger Games ends in a manner that could be considered a conclusion, it does leave events open to a followup. Strong, emotional ties that are formed during the games have powerful implications at home, and the outcome sets the stage for the germination of a movement. I for one am very curious what will happen next.",8,3,10,11 April 2012
Argo," Truth Is Better Than Fiction in ARGO
","Ben Affleck has been a leading man with credibility behind the camera as the Oscar-winning co-writer (with Matt Damon) of Good Will Hunting. Having shown promise as a director in Gone Baby Gone and then excelling in The Town, he has peaked in his craft with Argo, a thoroughly engaging, real life thriller grounded in historic fact and abetted by a superior screenplay (Chris Terrio from a news article).On November 4, 1979 in revolutionary Iran, angry students storm the US embassy and take civilian and military hostages, but unknown to the public, six Americans escape to a nearby Canadian's home where they remain stranded with no hope of rescue. Despite a myriad of standard tactics to spirit them out of Iran, every plan has a serious flaw, and each passing day heightens the probability of the Americans' discovery, capture, and possible execution as spies. Enter Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck), an expert at ex-filtration or the liberating of valuable government assets for the CIA. His plan is a bold, imaginative conceit: a Hollywood movie crew scouting locations in Iran while sneaking the Americans out as part of the film crew. Despite the misgivings of highly skeptical State Department and CIA officials led by Jack O'Donnell (Bryan Cranston), the mission is given a 'go' with little hope of success. Compounding things is the fact that the Iranians are painstakingly sifting through the embassy's hastily shredded documents. With the assistance of an Oscar winning makeup artist, John Chambers (John Goodman), and producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), Mendez creates an elaborate, fake science fiction movie named Argo complete with a script and cast. Will this movie cover work and can Mendez get the six Americans to freedom in time? As a true story only recently declassified by the US government, these actual events lead to a breathtaking finish.The authentic reenactment of the embassy takeover is expertly, vividly intercut seamlessly with real news footage. Affleck has a keen eye for detail, and he convincingly captures the chaos and paranoia that grips the trapped Americans. Good use of hand-held camera-work adds to the authentic feel of this quasi-documentary narrative. It's like an episode of TV's Mission Impossible, and, in fact, this could easily have been a made-for-TV movie, but it works better on the big screen where it has maximum impact. There are more than passing similarities to Wag the Dog and its phony movie ruse. The Anti-American sentiment and mistrust fosters a claustrophobic atmosphere as the six Americans are under great pressure. The film depicts the real threats and atrocities in the city streets including random executions. Not knowing who to trust, the Americans bicker amongst themselves with some expressing serious reservations about this unusual rescue premise while others are feeling despondent. Their fear is not unlike those of pursued Holocaust civilians in World War II. Mendez, who risks his life to save these strangers, is also a father, and it is that relationship that frames his character in the film emotionally. Chambers and Siegel (a composite character) are patriots with big egos, and while their comic relief is welcome (including a running gag: an off-color play on the word Argo,) in an otherwise suspense-filled narrative, one wonders what truly motivates them? The final airport sequence is unbearably tense as it ratchets up the threat, and such a relatively basic situation is executed to great effect. We know how the story will end yet it affects us in a visceral way. If the filmmakers take some dramatic license at the end, the film has earned the right to embellish the facts a bit further. After seeing their story, to see the images of the actors and their real life counterparts in the closing credits adds poignancy and credibility.One can only hope that Affleck can excel to loftier heights with his next project. He is already in rarified air, and an Oscar nomination awaits. In Argo, he has fashioned a nail-biter that never ignores the humanity that binds us together, whether it be father and son, husband and wife, or a rescuer and his newly found friends.",9,0,1,5 December 2012
Star Trek Into Darkness," The Brilliance of STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS
","J. J. Abrams (Super 8, Alias, Fringe, Lost) has excelled in television and movies particularly resurrecting Star Trek by reinventing its essence for new audiences while respecting its origins. In Star Trek Into Darkness, he expands on keys characters and continues his mastery of plot and non-stop action. As summer entertainment, it is a class act and sends the science fiction/adventure series on a spectacular trajectory. It is also the best Star Trek movie since The Wrath of Khan.Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) and Dr. McCoy (Karl Urban) are pursued by a primitive tribe on an alien planet as Mr. Spock (Zachary Quinto) attempts to prevent a catastrophic volcanic explosion from within. Their activities call into the question The Prime Directive where nothing should alter a civilization from without. In fact, Kirk's outrageous, rule-breaking behavior gets him in hot water with mentor, Captain Pike (Bruce Greenwood) and Starfleet. At the same time, a horrifying explosion in London reveals the presence of a mysterious man (Benedict Cumberbatch) named John Harrison, who exhibits a remarkable intellect and physical prowess. The cryptic Harrison is pursued to Kronos, home planet to the warrior race of Klingons and the threat of all out war. Overseeing the mission directive is Admiral Marcus (Peter Weller) whose presence is felt in unexpected ways. It all leads to a revelation that threatens not only the Enterprise, but Starfleet and Earth.As the original TV series often dealt with contemporary issues, there are strong parallels with current headlines in the form of terrorism. In fact much of the film has a grim, dark tone as the crew must face a superior, ruthless adversary, and a couple scenes of mass destruction have a 9/11 feel. There are a number of references to the old TV series and original Trek films as names, locales, music, and even dialogue are lifted and cleverly interjected. Tribbles, anyone? And you've got to love those retro uniforms especially Saldana's! Pike and Kirk have what amounts to a father-son relationship, and this is tested in a pivotal moment. We witness this relatively new crew as it becomes more cohesive under duress, and that is part of the fun as we watch McCoy's character and the beginnings of his amusing, trademark gripes. There are plenty of heroics from our stars, and Scotty (Simon Pegg) and Uhura (Zoe Saldana) shine in key moments. You only wish to see if the classic trio (Kirk, Spock, and McCoy) could mix it up more, but you do see the core beginnings of their dynamic bond. There are strong, recurring themes of loyalty and sacrifice for the good of the majority, or in other words, 'the needs of the many' Cumberbatch, (TVs current Sherlock Holmes) is outstanding as a powerful adversary. Weller is particularly effective as the imposing Admiral with a hidden agenda.The visual effects are impressively on display when the starship Enterprise explodes into warp speed and when devastating terrorist acts decimate a major city. The pacing is quite good, so don't think too hard on credibility gaps. Where does Harrison come from? Anybody check his blood type? Why is Starfleet headquarters virtually unguarded? And what's the deal on those torpedoes? Abrams is a master showman and he knows how to engineer cliffhangers upon cliffhangers. The film has a memorable climax that will ring déjà vu with a twist, but is nonetheless quite emotional. It solidifies the Kirk-Spock relationship forever and could have served as one of the best endings in Trekdom, but the filmmakers chose to springboard to another exciting moment which leaves the door open for future adventures of the five year kind. To say any more would spoil things. A third film in this installment would be hard pressed to surpass the energy and sheer acumen he demonstrates in this sequel, but Abrams has proved he can followup a directing gig by remaining the producer with another talented director taking the reigns and still achieve spectacular results (see Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol). For the man who has been chosen to take over Star Wars franchise, the sky's the limit.",9,5,9,27 May 2013
Public Enemies," PUBLIC ENEMIES Rekindles Gangster Era
","Johnny Depp is hitting his stride in recent years with his Pirates of the Caribbean films and character roles. Director/writer Michael Mann has been a respected stylist of the crime genre with such notables as Heat, Thief, and TV's Miami Vice. The union of these two super talents results in a more than satisfactory retelling of the legendary bank robber, John Dillinger, in Public Enemies. This violent tale focuses on the free spirit of Dillinger and his infamous robberies in the Midwest at the height of the Great Depression.In 1933, the country is in the midst of the Great Depression and bank robber John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) captures the public's fascination and even folk hero worship. Having helped to break his friends out of prison, he continues his robberies in and around Chicago. As the crime wave sweeps the Midwest, the FBI's J. Edgar Hoover enlists up and coming agent, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale), (who has just nailed Pretty Boy Floyd,) to capture Dillinger, Public Enemy Number One. Purvis employs a variety of sophisticated listening devices and police work to track him. Dillinger thinks he is invincible and executes even more daring bank robberies. He dates hat check girl Billie Frechette (Marion Cotillard) and travels with her to Florida for horse races and then to Arizona, where lawmen recognize and arrest him. Transported to Indiana State Penitentiary, an easier place to breakout than a federal prison thanks to his mob lawyer, he uses a fake gun to engineer an escape. He is joined by notorious hothead robber, Baby Faced Nelson, and they score more violent robberies. Purvis insists on recruiting a crack force of Texas lawmen who assist him in closing in on the Dillinger gang leading to a memorable shootout in Little Bohemia. As Dillinger crosses the state line, he violates federal laws and brings pressure on organized criminals, who turn on the fugitive. Billie's fear that John will be caught or killed is tempered by her love for him, and when she is captured by local law enforcement, Purvis intercedes. When a call girl comes forward with information about Dillinger, Purvis sets up a fateful ambush at The Biograph Theater where the FBI will be waiting.It is interesting that Dillinger's relationship with organized crime syndicates helped him with a legal infrastructure that disappeared once the mob deemed him a risk to their lucrative business. Further, Hoover's political agenda was desperate to make headlines and build the FBI into a future powerhouse of law. It is also fascinating how technically proficient the FBI was on its use of wire taps and eavesdropping devices while being relatively incompetent in conducting a simple arrest or taking part in a shootout.What is refreshing is the core romance between Dillinger and Billie Frechette. Dillinger is presented as bold, charismatic and at times ruthless. It is his bravado that attracts fellow criminals and Billie to him. Cotillard gets a strong role that is considerably more than window dressing. Her performance is convincing, and her chemistry with Depp's Dillinger makes this romance believable and heartbreaking thus lending an emotion subtext to the typical gangster movie. Bales's Purvis is portrayed as an obsessed, determined lawman who is dry and dull in sharp contrast to the devil may care attitude of the freewheeling Dillinger. Billy Crudup registers effectively as the young Hoover. Mann favorite Stephen Lang, barely recognizable, registers a solid performance as a hardened Texas lawman who is critical to the end of the film.Besides the usual set designs and costumes to mimic the depression era, heavy use is made of period music. The Little Bohemia shootout is a major set piece with heavy use of hand-held cameras. Although a detailed montage of action, it still does not have the visceral impact of John Milius' Dillinger or even the classic, G-Men. There is also an extended bank heist reminiscent of Mann's Heat in its boldness and precision of execution. The climactic ambush at the Biograph Theater is depicted in excruciating detail and still carries a great deal of tension.The last scene at a women's prison may never actually have happened, and it is curious that Lang's lawman and not Purvis serves as the catalyst for this key moment. The subsequent, final shot of Cotillard after getting a special message is quite memorable. It almost raises this film to another level.Public Enemies is not the best of Michael Mann, but it is a solid entry in his canon of crime films. What is notable is another star turn by Depp, an actor at his creative peak.",7,4,6,30 August 2009
Spider-Man 2," Spiderman 2 casts a strong web
","My spider senses are tingling over the next installment of Spiderman, number 2 to be exact. If only all sequels were half as good. Not only does it rock, but it also has oodles of heart and feeling to make this the best comic book adaptation to date. Yes, that's saying a lot but it just shows a healthy appreciation of the effort and results of doing a superior sequel to one of the most successful super hero films ever. Spiderman set box office opening records and garnered solid reviews. Just as X Men 2 improved on its original film, Spiderman 2 does an even better job with some significant enhancements to storyline and plot. In this story, Peter Parker, AKA Spiderman, is experiencing self-doubts about his purpose in life. His heroics are mocked and capitalized by the local newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson (J. K. Simmons is a hoot) while his personal life takes a heavy toll. His love for Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) must take a back seat to his heroics lest she be in harm's way. Eventually he goes through what might be called super hero depression and starts to lose his powers. Meanwhile his best friend, Harry (James Franco), still vengeful about Spiderman supposedly murdering his dad in the previous film, is now head of the same technology firm and readying a new fusion power device with a scientist Dr. Octavius (played with gusto and depth by Alfred Molina). Naturally the experiment goes bad and Dr. Octavius is now part man and part machine dubbed Doc Octopus. Seeking more power, he trades the safe delivery of Spiderman to Franco in exchange for more nuclear elements to power a bigger fusion reaction. Add to this the kidnapping of Mary Jane in the clutches of Doc Oc and, well you get the picture, except it is done so well.Virtually the entire cast reappears from the original film whether in dream sequences or cameos, and they are refreshing to see again in the context of this film. Stan Lee makes his obligatory cameo as well as Ted Raimi (director Raimi's brother) as assistant to Jameson. Bruce Campbell (a long time Raimi crony) has an amusing cameo as a theater usher. Director John Landis is almost unrecognizable as Peter's doctor. (Trivia- Landis and director Raimi had cameos in the television adaptation of Stephen King's The Stand.) The villain, Doc Oc, is well played by Alfred Molina. James Franco's character does move forward is his character's arc, and there is a nice setup to the next film (which is certain). Rosemary Murphy as Peter's Aunt May has a significant presence in this film-her speech to Peter Parker midway through the story is truly a highlight as it marks the basic theme. Kirsten Dunst is adorable as ever. Tobey Maguire IS SpidermanÂ–who else can engender the right mix of pathos and super heroics?The first half of the film is identical to the first film but it is in the second half where it takes the initial themes developed in first half and develops them to an emotional punch. And boy what a second half! Not only suspenseful and dramatic, Spiderman 2 is also wildly funny in places. There are some poignant moments of revelation and the story keeps upping the ante in really satisfying fashion. After all, Marvel Comics, the source for Spiderman, was unique when it imbued its heroes with emotions and problems. The spirit of Marvel lives on in this film's structure. Credit goes to a battery of writers especially Oscar-winning writer Alvin Sargent (Julia) who really delivers a first class script. The film doesn't feel the need to constantly bombard the viewer with nonstop explosions and chases. What's nice is that it takes its deliberate time to flesh out the storyline and characters without skimping on the appropriate action scenes. There is a tremendous set piece on an above ground New York subway train, which climaxes in a rousing and touching finish. Just that scene would have saved any movie. In this, it is one of several.As a treat for fans, references abound throughout the film to previous Spiderman incarnations such as the musical theme from the 60's animated show, the main title credits include key scenes from the first film, and, in particular, the memorable rain soaked kiss in the first film figures heavily here. Production values are good but the special effects are exceedingly impressive (better than before) especially the Doc Octopus sequences. Sam Raimi has made the perfect comic book for adults. The second half reaches levels that many films let alone comic book adaptations have aspired to but rarely reach. Raimi and company have set the bar extremely high for the next sequel.",Null,0,0,30 June 2004
127 Hours," The Agony and Ecstasy of 127 HOURS
","Based on the harrowing tale of survival by Aron Ralston and adapted by Simon Beaufoy and director Danny Boyle (Slumdog Millionaire, 28 Days Later), 127 Hours challenges the viewer to share in a difficult, life changing event that most people could never contemplate. It's quite a feat to engage and emotionally move an audience focused solely on one person in one place. For an actor to pull this off is a great testament to James Franco's acting skills and physical prowess as well as Boyle's ingenuity behind the camera. In April, 2003, Aron Ralston (Franco) escapes the rat race of the city to go hiking in a remote terrain. After parking his car, he goes mountain biking and then by foot deeper into isolation. There, he comes upon two hikers, Megan and Kristi, who are a bit lost. He tells them that the earth with its rocks and mountains is always moving. How prophetic! Aron guides the women and puts them on the right track after a brief adventure in a cave and a sparkling pool of water. Later, he proceeds on his trek of solitude and, while climbing between a narrow ravine, slips, and as he falls, a large bolder tumbles and pins his arm against the wall. Trying everything possible to dislodge the rock, he finds he is hopelessly trapped with limited supplies. No one knows where he is because he was didn't care enough to mention it to family or friends. He is a confident, even cocky explorer whose cavalier attitude changes through this ordeal. He displays some amazing resourcefulness in such moments as when he erects a mini tent to protect his head from the elements. As he waits in vain for help that is not coming, he contemplates his survival skills and evaluates his life and relationships. Life is precious, and he must do whatever he can to survive even if it means the unthinkable. The entire film works despite the fact it centers exclusively on one actor. (The Spirit of St. Louis is another that comes to mind.) Franco accomplishes the difficult task by making us care for an arrogant, free spirit who knows no fear. The film focuses on minute details that could easily be glossed over. The simplest of acts become a tortuous struggle as when his pocket knife falls and he must retrieve it while still pinned. A drink of water from his ever shrinking supply becomes an agonizing death watch. The flashback scenes give us some background into his family life and a former girlfriend. He even fantasizes a vision of a boy, a son that he will perhaps have someday? He regrets the things left undone or unsaid and resolves to make changes in his life if he makes it out alive. The fact that we know the outcome does not at all diminish the agony we feel for him in close quarters and his determination to survive. In a way the big rock is a kind of metaphor for his life. What should be a liberating journey becomes a test of survival, and as the hours go by and one day bleeds into the next, we become a part of his limited world complete with cracks of sunlight and an occasional bird or insect. After awhile you wonder if we really see images he is seeing, or if it is nothing more than a mirage or hallucination. During his ordeal he uses his mini video camera to document his plight and to report on his situation and feelings. The camera becomes a sort of confessor for him. Yes, the scene where he must separate himself from the rock is excruciating but never exploitive. The subsequent scenes where he makes his way back to civilization and encounters other hikers are powerfully heart wrenching yet life affirming. It packs a punch and wrings you emotionally as Franco finds salvation when all hope is seemingly lost. By film's end we breathe a collective sigh of relief. Yet it is the cumulative effect of emotions and our shared experience with him that are truly affecting. Boyle utilizes hand-held cameras and crisp editing to keep things moving along in a methodically paced narrative. It is ironic at how the beautiful landscape is in sharp contrast to the horror that Aron must experience. The film may set a record for having the longest running time before displaying its first title card. There is a nice epilogue which alludes to his prophetic visions from before. This is not a morbid exercise in claustrophobia or grossness but rather a realistic recreation of the triumph of the human spirit against impossible odds and the bleakest of settings.",8,0,1,25 February 2011
Juno," Juno's Touching, Growing Pains
","An interesting phenomenon is happening slowly in Hollywood. The offspring of some of the movie industry's best directors have begun to assert themselves with their own, distinct voices. Sofia Coppola (Lost in Translation), whose father is Francis Coppola of The Godfather fame, Nick Cassavetes (The Notebook) whose father John Cassavetes pioneered independent films, and now Jason Reitman whose father is Ivan Reitman of Ghostbusters fame, have all proved that talent can be in the genes. Reitman has perfectly realized his vision of a coming-of-age drama, Juno, based on a fabulous script by newbie, Diablo Cody. This small, original film has enough intelligence and creative film-making to stand among bigger budgeted studio releases as among the best of 2007.Juno MacGuff (Ellen Page) is a sixteen year old high schooler whose planned sexual encounter results in an unplanned pregnancy that causes a sensation among her classmates and at home with her dad and step mom. A smart, sassy-mouthed loner, Juno, after deliberating on whether or not to abort the unborn, takes matters in her own hands and decides to donate her baby to an adopting, yuppie couple, Mark and Vanessa. Life is not so easy as situations change suddenly, and the dynamics of Mark and Vanessa throw everything into a tailspin as Juno's life becomes much more complicated. Wondering if couples can ever really stay together and if true love can exist, Juno makes some hard, mature choices in her life.The movie is presented in a unique format with actual, script lines subtitling the bottom of every shot. It's almost as if the DVD extras are being used on screen. This device, while interesting, can be a bit annoying too. A series of ballads punctuate and underscore the narrative much like Cat Stevens did in Harold and Maude. It does enhance the story and mood. The structure of the narrative is sectioned by the seasons beginning with autumn.High school life is portrayed in a convincing manner with the behaviors and interplay dead on target. Some individual scenes like Juno's parents first hearing and fearing what big announcement Juno has in store for them, or the confrontation with the ultrasound technician are pretty amusing. And there are quiet, introspective moments like between Juno and her dad or with her 'boyfriend' Bleeker that are quite touching.Ellen Page already made her mark with the recent Hard Candy and showed her versatility in X Men-The Last Stand, but to exhibit that rare combination of drama and humor in a believable manner is quite a feat. There is not one false note in her impressive performance. You begin to place yourself in her position and empathize through her joy and pain. The rest of the cast is strong, and each has good portions of dialogue to capitalize upon. J .K. Simmons is quickly becoming a go-to character actor as Juno's dad, and you wish Allison Janney had a bit juicier part to fly with as the step mom. Jennifer Garner and Jason Bateman are quite good as the prospective, adoptive parents. Michael Cera (Superbad) and Olivia Thirlby make convincing schoolmates.We discover with Juno that life can be full of unexpected surprises and twists, and it is how we deal with those events that can have a profound and lasting effect on one's future and happiness. (I can't wait for writer Cody's next story.) When you think about it, the screenplay rings true throughout without being preachy or awkward; it just sounds like it could really happen. That's what makes Juno a terrific slice of life tale, a deceptively simple story with a rich core of acting and words. Oscars love this kind of independent jewel.",9,1,8,21 January 2008
Midnight in Paris," MIDNIGHT IN Paris-A Valentine to the City of Lights
","One of the most productive and sought after directors (by actors), Woody Allen, has made dozens of films that deal with the often turbulent relationships between men and women. Almost exclusively a New Yorker by heart, Allen has begun a renaissance of sorts with his exploration of European settings in particular Paris, France, and although his films of the past decade have varied in quality, his latest, Midnight in Paris, is a standout and represents the writer/director at the top of his game.Opening with a spectacular collage of vignettes, Paris never looked more enticing or romantic (Manhattan redux). At the fabled Giverny, Monet's source of inspiration, an American couple, Gil (Owen Wilson) and Inez (Rachel McAdams) are engaged to be married and yet squabble constantly. An idealist, He is smitten by the culture and history of Paris, and one night while strolling the streets alone, a vintage car drives by and gives him a ride to a café. Gil realizes that he has been transported to 1920's Paris and is mingling with the celebrities of its heyday including some famous American ex-patriots like Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Gil is struggling with a novel and needs some advice, so who better than Gertrude Stein (amusingly played by Kathy Bates) to critique the manuscript? Upon his return to present day Paris, Gil wonders if it was all a dream but the scene repeats itself the next evening at midnight when he meets Pablo Picasso and the beautiful Adriana (Marion Cotillard), who captures Gil's fancy. Thinking that Gil has lost his mind, Inez begins to show interest in another male friend. Meanwhile Gil is obsessed with Adriana, and as the couple visits the Moulin Rouge, they find themselves transported to an even earlier, romantic period in French history. Gil finds that Adriana has her own ideas about life, and he is about to find true love in the unlikeliest of places.This is Allen in high gear and, though it does not necessarily rank among his best, it certainly is a throwback to his vintage period of Manhattan and the film that this will be most compared to The Purple Rose of Cairo, with its similar combination of wistful fantasy, storybook romance, and sophisticated comedy. You do wonder how Gil and Inez could ever become a couple considering how much they bicker about most everything. It's also interesting how Allen uses a bit of sleight of hand by focusing our attention on Gil and Adriana that we miss an obvious connection. Such is love.Gil is a surrogate for Allen's inner voice. (One could even picture a younger Allen actually performing the role.) He is also a romantic in contrast to Inez's friends who are intellectuals. As for Paris, it plays a supporting role as its landmarks are adoringly featured throughout the film without detracting from the characters or story. It is clear Allen is smitten with the City of Lights as he was with his home base of New York City.There are some amusing scenes including the fate of a private investigator hired to follow Gil and ends up caught up in a different time running for his life. When Gil listens to old Cole Porter recordings or sees Picasso paintings in a museum, the joke is that he actually has met these men in real life! In another scene, Gil suggests to a young director, Luis Bunuel, a film idea which is the plot to The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie that he will make many years later (and win an Oscar). As Salvador Dali, Adrien Brody hams it up to great effect in a brief scene.Sure Allen has made some good films recently like Match Point and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, but it's been a long while since he made anything as imaginative, comedic, and romantic at the same time. Vive le Woody Allen!",9,1,2,24 February 2012
Hotel Rwanda," Hotel Rwanda honors a man who made a difference
","A decade ago, the country of Rwanda underwent a costly civil war which claimed countless lives while a whole world stood by. In the true story of Hotel Rwanda, one ordinary man took it upon himself to save as many people as he could even risking his own life and the lives of his family.This hotel is a luxurious venue for travelers (mostly white) to spend a pleasant trip while attended to by the staff and its manager, Paul Rusesabagina (Don Cheadle). Ominous signs in the news and rumors point to growing hostilities between two ethnic groups, the minority and former ruling group of Tutsis and the majority group of Hutus. A militaristic movement among the Hutus begins to form even as an impending peace treaty is brokered. When one leader is assassinated, all hell breaks loose. This is civil war at its worst as the Hutus begins to attack and kill the Tutsis en masse. It is the beginning of a genocide that will claim close to a million lives as the United Nations does relatively little to intervene.As the white guests are escorted to safety by United Nations troops, things grow desperate for those left behind. Paul starts to shelter a few people including his own family and then more refugees until over 1200 fearful souls seek safety in the hotel. In some instances, it is out of necessity that he take in people who have nowhere to go. Pretty soon he realizes that he must do all he can to save his people and himself. This means calling on favors and relationships with any and all who can help, and frequently it means the difference between life and death. There are numerous occasions where the military is ready to take the refugees away or execute them and Paul on the spot. There is stark evidence of the increasing atrocities as homes are burned and bodies litter the roads. Bribes and supplies begin to run short, and as the outnumbered UN forces return to escort only a limited number to safety, the rebels begin to descend on them and the hotel.As a shameful, cautionary tale of what happened when the world ignored its most needy, Hotel Rwanda serves its purpose, but the main thrust of the story is the love Paul has for his wife and children and the determination to save them. The important thing is how he responds to the horrific events and how he must think his way out of seemingly impossible situations. It is truly remarkable how resourceful the real Paul Rusesabagina was in staving off doom.As portrayed by Don Cheadle, we understand his thought processes and feel his pain. He never loses his humanity and compassion for his fellow man. It is a splendid job of acting. Ironically, Cheadle (who was not considered box office leading material by the studios) has leaped into the forefront of leading men for good after having spent most of his career in strong supporting parts (Bulworth, Oceans 11, Out of Sight). Sophie Okonedo is quite good as the wife who must fight for her family and support her beleaguered husband. Nick Nolte plays a recurring part as a UN officer whose units of soldiers are virtually powerless to help. Joaquin Phoenix has a small role as a news cameraman witnessing the beginning slaughter and Jean Reno has a good cameo as a hotel executive in France who proves to be a valuable ally.Although, there was initial difficulty in securing financing for this project, director Terry George (who also wrote the screenplay with Keir Pearson) does not seem to have skimped on his visuals. The massive crowd scenes and evidence of mass execution are thorough and impressive. It is as if we are living a real life documentary about war. He does a nice job of contrasting the chaos in the countryside with the peaceful, relative calm inside the hotel. He also manages to balance the tension and terror with a few effective moments of honest humor especially with Paul's family-quite a feat.While there are obvious similarities in theme to Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda's protagonist is not only the benefactor, but he becomes a potential victim, thus raising the stakes. Even with a PG-13 rating compared to Schindler's R rating, this is no less compelling history and the events no less despicable. George does not have the directorial flourishes of Spielberg, but his film succeeds on an emotional level.Although the subject matter may cause potential audiences to pause, those who want an intelligent, honest depiction of one man's remarkable acts of heroism amid an unthinkable tragedy will not be disappointed. It is a courageous film that teaches the audience about individual responsibility and choice. It is about one man making a difference for over a thousand of his countrymen amid the horror and chaos even as the world turned its back.**** out of **** (every bit as good as the five Oscar nominated Best Pictures of 2004)",Null,5,7,26 January 2005
Crash," Real People Collide in Crash
","Based on his screenplay with Robert Moresco, Paul Haggis makes what is essentially his feature film debut with a thoroughly involving drama of disparate characters in a series of seemingly unrelated events in and around Los AngelesOne evening culminates in a car accident being investigated by police and a grim discovery for one of the detectives. Flashback to the day before as a dozen characters deal with urban survival. A couple of idealistic, black youths carjack an upper class couple who turn out to be the district attorney and his shallow wife. A proud, Persian shop keeper and his wife struggle to keep their business open and safe. A locksmith, who is Hispanic, is also a loving, protective father to his precious five year old daughter. A repressed movie director and his combative wife are pulled over by an aggressive, angry cop and his younger, moral partner. These are people who are haunted by guilt and fear as they strive for some kind of happiness. As events unfold, each set of characters is affected by an apparently random act by another group which has long lasting consequences for all of them.To detail exactly what happens will spoil a delicate web of plot lines that are mutually supporting one another in almost operatic fashion. Haggis, who adapted the heartbreaking gem, 'Million Dollar Baby' (and honed his writing skills on many a television series), has devised an intricate, multi-layered morality play on a grand scale. Borrowing liberally from the story structures of his contemporaries like Paul Thomas Anderson ('Magnolia') and veterans like Robert Altman ('Nashville'), he masters the form with surprising ease and to the audience's edification. He does not dumb down the script but rather treats his audience with intelligence. The dialogue is on occasion wordy and blatant commentary while other times the words carry a bite and sting as they ring true to the human condition. Any edgier dialogue would start to become Tarantino like. Although there are several references to racial intolerance and conflict, these serve as more of a springboard to broader ideas and relationships. Haggis wisely avoids clichés thus keeping the events and actions fresh and original. When a scene looks like it will end expectedly, something different happens to change its direction in interesting ways. None of the characters is truly good or evil; instead they are full blooded characters who yearn for a better life while tarnished by their current affliction be it economic, physical, or emotional. Just when you think the film will go down a dark path with tragic results, it throws another wrinkle to keep you guessing and pleasantly surprise you. And when tragedy does strike, it happens in an unexpected, ironic way. Don Cheadle is part of a well cast group of emsemble players, many of whom reduced their payscales to take on what amounted to be supporting work. It doesn't hurt if the script is as strong and well conceived as this one. Cheadle is excellent as the detective who tries to help his mother and his often absent brother. Brandon Fraser and Sandra Bullock play the D.A. and his wife. Terrence Dashon Howard and Thandie Newton play a glamorous Hollywood couple who must confront racial and emotional issues. Matt Dillon and Ryan Phillippe are the policemen whose portrayals begin on opposite ends of the moral spectrum and wind up switching places. Special mention goes to Michael Pena as the locksmith. The city scenes are photographed with a gritty realism and the music, predominantly led by New Age composer Mark Isham, lends a dreamlike, aura to the film's mood. All the major story lines are followed through by movie's end with hardly a loose end. It is ironic that the film is reminiscent of a lesser, 1970's made-for television drama, 'Smashup on Interstate 5'.There are times early in the film that one thinks it will degenerate into a racially charged statement, but it never loses course. The roles both large and small seem more than sketches after awhile. You care about what happens to all of them, even the more criminal elements because they are real people. The film plays like a mosaic or puzzle of fragments and pieces that slowly but satisfyingly come together. Although there are more than a couple of coincidental events and incidents including car accidents that link many of the characters, the improbable happenings are easy to forgive since we are in the hands of a good storyteller. These chance encounters serve as a catalyst or storytelling device to propel the story further. Crash is an ambitious film with lofty goals that it attains with great frequency. Haggis should be commended for weaving an ambitious tapestry of lives and fate without resorting to easy, simplistic answers.",9,3,12,6 May 2005
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Captain America : The Winter Soldier and the Paranoia of Fear
","Directed with the sure hands of brothers Anthony and Joe Russo (TV's Community) from an excellent screenplay by Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely, Captain America: The Winter Soldier is easily the best of the stand alone Marvel films and a thrilling action film full of big surprises and twists with far reaching consequences. A superior sequel like X Men 2 and The Dark Knight, it raises the stakes of good story telling and intricate plotting of comic book adaptations in the guise of a political thriller.Steve Rogers AKA Captain America (Chris Evans) continues his adjustment to 21st century life after his thaw from the deep freeze (in Captain America: The First Avenger) and befriends a fellow veteran, Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie). On a typical mission for S.H.I.E.L.D., Cap and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) lead a team of agents to rescue a pirated ship which turns up an interesting bit of information. Meanwhile, as S.H.I.E.L.D. readies the major launch of a defense system in Washington, D.C., there are growing concerns expressed by boss Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) to his superior, Alexander Pierce (Robert Redford). As suspicions multiply, all hell breaks loose when there is an assassination attempt on one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s own. The conspiracy leads Captain America to a confrontation with a mysterious, formidable figure, The Winter Soldier (Sebastian Stan), whose strength and skills are extraordinary. With only a small circle of comrades, everything Cap has come to value comes crashing down. Loyalties are tested and just who will survive a major shift in the world order is just the beginning of an insidious plot.For fans of Cap, these are grand times as the filmmakers have chosen a major story arc (The Winter Soldier) from his comic annals and incorporated Silver Age characters, e.g. The Falcon (Mackie) and Batroc. Recently, super hero films have chosen to bend the rules and take chances with tradition. This film goes much further than any previous Marvel adaptation. It features a good mystery, topical subject matter on individual privacy, and significant plot twists so much so that it is essential for the viewer to watch them unfold without any spoilers. The smart script contains witty lines amid a pervasive feeling of mistrust and paranoia. When Cap responds to Fury's state of the art weaponry to combat threats and says, 'This isn't freedom. This is fear,' it sums up the theme of the story. Think of this as homage to 1970s conspiracy classics like Three Days of the Condor, The Parallax View, and Marathon Man. The film also employs moments that references Mission Impossible, The X Files, RoboCop, and 24.Acting is uniformly strong as some old, familiar faces return, and a few new ones get introduced. By now Evans has become the embodiment of the iconic hero, retaining his sense of justice, duty, and morals, virtues which are downright refreshing in a post 9/11 world. Rogers is a Rip Van Winkle out of his time and still learning to assimilate the world changes and cultural references with amusing results. Evans' chemistry with Johansson is believable yet ironic since their two characters have vastly different backgrounds. In a costarring role, Johansson's Black Widow is resourceful, smart, and deadly as a S.H.I.E.L.D. operative whose history is only beginning to be scratched. Perhaps Black Widow should have her own film! Jackson's Fury has an expanded role and reveals more facets of his mysterious background. Robert Redford (All the President's Men) has a significant, atypical role as a high level official, and he is outstanding. His presence alone adds legitimacy and authority to the film. Mackie (The Hurt Locker) is an ideal buddy in arms to Evans. Emily VanCamp makes a good first impression as a young agent, and Cobie Smulders (returning as Agent Maria Hill) provides solid backup.The many impressive action sequences are noteworthy for their ferocity and meticulous detail, but the standouts are a mad, opening car chase through the streets of D.C., and a remarkable fight in a glass elevator that surpasses the gem in Die Hard: With a Vengeance. There are moments of intense hand to hand combat that recall the best moments of the Bourne films on steroids. You've also got to love that shield; the film wisely displays all the creative ways Cap's shield is employed in combat. The violence here is realistically depicted and not cartoonish which pushes its PG-13 rating. Extensive use of hand-held cameras and more live action special effects than CGI lend a stronger sense of realism. D.C. locations make a splendid backdrop for much of the film.Taking super hero filmmaking to new heights, Captain America: The Winter Soldier successfully interconnects what we know from previous films and effectively challenges you to reevaluate everything in the Marvel Universe. It certainly helps to have seen the previous films, but there is sufficient background and context that a casual outsider would still enjoy it. (Fans of TV's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will have a field day as the events tie directly with the show.) Though the film ends with open ended story threads that beg for another sequel, consider this as The Empire Strikes Back of Captain America. That's not such a bad place to be.(As usual, don't forget two post credit scenes which are significant.)",9,5,9,17 April 2014
Life of Pi," The Meaning of Existence in LIFE OF PI
","Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, had long been considered unfilmable until Oscar-winning director, Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), did the impossible. He (with an adaptation by screenwriter David Magee) has made a visually stunning adventure about ultimate survival and the meaning of existence in the universe. It is a unique film experience and one that requires openness and a certain suspension of disbelief.Pi is an impressionable young boy whose exposure to religion develops into an embracing of more than one faith much to the consternation of his father. The family owns a zoo in the French part of India and one day are forced to uproot their lives and head to Canada by cargo ship. During a powerful storm, the ship sinks and all hands are lost except Pi, orphaned and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with no help and a lifeboat filled with an unlikely manifest: wild animals including a tiger, oddly named Richard Parker. An unusual dynamic plays out as Pi struggles to stay alive in the elements and contend with the ferocious beast. As the hours turn into days and then weeks, Pi, left with only his instincts and ingenuity, is forced to improvise and utilize all his survival skills amid dwindling supplies. When hope begins to fade for rescue, some unlikely, awe inspiring events occur that mean the difference between life and death.Lee, no stranger to computer generated effects (Hulk, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), has done a major accomplishment here by adapting the challenging logistics of the source material and making it accessible and compelling to an audience. He is no doubt aided by incredible advancements in special visual effects that form a significant portion of the film and recreate unforgettable moments including the fatal storm and the sinking cargo ship, the wondrous, luminescent phenomenon at night, and the depiction of animals in the lifeboat especially the tiger, Richard Parker, who becomes a major character. Some of the imagery is remarkable in 3-D.Suraj Sharma is quite convincing as the young Pi; it's a one man show for a majority of the film. The story, told in a flashback, is about Pi's ascension to manhood, and he is in essence is a citizen of the world, not having been bound to any one religion. His curiosity and spiritual journey serve to make this an allegorical tale, and it is his relationship with Richard Parker that serves as a foundation to the story. He wonders about his deadly companion and ponders the question, 'Do animals have souls?' In essence, Parker is Pi's Wilson (from Castaway) but with a soul. Pi's interaction with the ocean is not unlike the solitary figures in The Old Man and the Sea and 127 Hours, in which mother nature can be lovely and deadly, giving and taking, a sort of protagonist and antagonist.There are unanswered questions. What really becomes of Richard Parker? And are we to believe this fantastic tale as fact or fiction or a warped truth? Is there a more plausible explanation? Maybe that's just the point of the story: that life is full of questions and wonder, and sometimes truth is stranger than fiction no matter how unlikely it may appear. Audiences who are willing to completely open their hearts and minds, will find a rewarding experience in this tragic yet fascinating exploration into the miracle of life. And the movie does look hauntingly beautiful.",9,2,5,11 March 2013
Pacific Rim," Pacific Rim Is a Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Thrill Ride
","Director Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth) has always had a fascination with fantasy and science fiction stories populated with unusual, colorful characters amid macabre settings. Originally set to direct The Hobbit films, he has, instead, switched gears and created a new film populated with mega monsters and super robotic warriors in an exciting, action spectacle, Pacific Rim. What sets this apart from most apocalyptic battles is its well developed characters and relationships. While its subject matter may not be for all tastes, it should satisfy most action and comic fans to the hilt.Set in the not too distant future, a growing threat emerges from an ocean breach in the form of enormous monsters (think Godzilla types) called Kaijus which ravage world cities. To combat these powerful creatures, world leaders construct giant war machines dubbed Jaegers which are controlled from within by a set of mind linked co-pilots. But the threat increases, and the creatures, who have remarkable, adaptive powers, duel with an ever dwindling number of outmatched Jaegers. While mentally linked, the copilots share each other's thoughts and memories. Ace pilot Raleigh Becket (Charlie Hunnam) has traumatic memories of loss from an earlier battle and must learn to overcome this while the prospect of a new co-pilot in the form of Mako Mori (Rinko Kikuchi) brings her own horrible past. As relationships are revealed and challenged, the monstrous Kaijus must be met in a last stand not only on land but at its mysterious source beneath the sea.While there is undeniable sexual tension between Becket and Mori, the filmmakers do not settle for clichéd romantic scenes, which a nice change of pace. The film deals primarily with facing and conquering one's own demons. Themes of loyalty, duty and sacrifice crop up. There are super mind melds and a nice dash of samurai mentality in the training and battle scenes, and there are elements of other action films like The Matrix and Top Gun especially towards the end. These Jaegers have some awesome, cool weaponry, and the high tech hardware is detailed and impressive yet well used and realistic. Movies such as The Transformers and the recent super hero films have raised the stakes of massive battle sequences in an urban setting, but Pacific Rim enlarges the playing field even more. And these monsters have tricks up their sleeve that would make even Godzilla envious. Although the scale of the film is breathtaking, del Toro always keeps things grounded in reality and honest emotions. These characters have a camaraderie that evolves throughout the storyline. Just like Peter Jackson in The Lord of the Rings films, del Toro demonstrates an impressive ability to marshal large set pieces while throwing in minute details or intimate moments. These things add to the texture of the story and its players; you begin to care for them. Idris Elba is fast becoming the actor of choice (from his start on TV's The Wire through the recent Prometheus). His role as the leader of the Jaegers, is critical to the storyline, and he even gets to have his own Independence Day/Henry V rallying speech. Charlie Day and Burn Gorman are a riot as rival scientists who bicker while trying to find solutions to the crises. Long time del Toro repertory stalwart Ron Perlman has an amusing supporting role as a black marketeer.Production credits are outstanding on all facets. Special effects are through the roof, and the score by Ramin Djawadi is appropriately heroic and pulsating. Do stay for the initial end credits for an amusing bonus scene.If this is not your cup of tea, it is best avoided. It is true there are perhaps too many climactic battles of these titans (Del Toro even displays a hint of shoe fetish). Yet for those who are game, it is a fun ride and a cut above typical sci-fi fare. For fans and geeks, it is nirvana. If you're going to make a film about giant war machines fighting larger-than-life evil to save the earth and instill the requisite human element, this is a textbook example of how to do it right. Imagine that: a sci-fi blockbuster that moves you! Boy, they are going to sell a lot of toys with this one!",8,21,33,21 July 2013
Corpse Bride," Real Emotions Breathe Life in THE CORPSE BRIDE
","Don't let the creepy title of this animated, musical tale throw you off. In the tradition of other excellent, animated features of recent years, The Corpse Bride will surely rank as one of the best. Granted, this kind of film may not be for all tastes, but if you can get past the title and are game for a wondrous, haunting world of fantasy and love, then this is your meal ticket.Victor and his parents meet Victoria and her family to attend a wedding rehearsal. Unbeknownst to Victor's family, it seems Victoria's parents are broke and desperately need the marriage to secure their future. Yet, marriage is new to the nervous Victor, and when he gets jittery at the church, he runs off and into the woods to collect his thoughts. There, he jokingly recites his wedding vows and slips his wedding band on a finger shaped piece of what appears to be wood. The next thing he knows, the wooden finger is a real finger belonging to a former bride, and she has sprung 'alive' to his offer of marriage. As Victor reels in horror and confusion at his 'corpse bride', he is whisked away to another world of people who have died. While the corpse bride is partly decomposed, she retains much of her former beauty. Yet others in this strange land are mere skeletons and rotted flesh. It turns out that the corpse bride was to be married, but her groom had evil plans for her. She has been waiting for her true love ever since her demise. Meanwhile, Victoria's parents are approached by a mysterious, handsome suitor who wants to marry Victoria. Victor must make a fateful decision and choose between the two brides even as the dead descend on the land of the living for a wedding ceremony like none other. One groom and two brides-what to do? This is Tim Burton's latest foray into stop motion animation, and he and Mike Johnson direct with economy from a relatively simple screenplay by John August, Pamela Pettler, and Caroline Thompson. The characters, especially Victor and the corpse bride, are well etched and create an emotional bond with the audience. Although we want Victor to marry his love Victoria, we grow to feel sympathy and attachment to the corpse bride as well. As for the images of the dead, Burton and company do a delightful job of making what, on the outset, could be grotesque and turning them into energized, playful souls. There is a terrific Peter Lorre homage with a worm who keeps popping in and out of the bride's eye socket. After a short time, the skeletal limbs and discolored dead no longer seem frightening or gross. Ironically the most colorful sequences involve the world of the dead while the living are painted in austere, lifeless mutes of gray.Much of the production team are veterans of other Burton films. Longtime collaborator Danny Elfman again provides an atmospheric score and a handful of nifty, little songs to move things along. Even the voices of the principals are Burton alumni, Johnny Depp and Helena Bonham Carter (Burton's significant other). Give Depp credit for voicing a British sounding character convincingly while others like Emily Watson, Albert Finney, Christopher Lee and Tracey Ullman, to name a few, are quite effective at bringing their figures to life. It's a testament to Burton's imaginative appeal that twice the usual number of major acting talents contributed to this work.For all those who loved Burton's earlier produced efforts, The Nightmare Before Christmas (whose ghoulish nature is quite similar) and James and the Giant Peach, this is a worthy followup. The animation itself is virtually seamless, and the characters and figures move as in real life. It is a far cry from the Rankin-Bass Christmas specials of the 1960's. The set designs and costumes are very much Gothic in style. It seems that Burton is drawing from his own films or is perpetuating his influences as evidenced in his previous films like Beetlejuice, Batman, and Edward Scissorhands particularly in his obsession with the good and evil in man. It also delves into the perception of life versus death. Who is really alive and who acts like the nonliving? It is evident that the true antecedent of The Corpse Bride is Burton's own version of Washington Irving's Sleepy Hollow with a nod toward Dickens (with its contrast in class distinction and its unsavory characters), especially the Miss Havisham character in Great Expectations.The Corpse Bride marks a continuing peak in the current revival of animated feature films which was signaled by Toy Story a decade earlier and has been raised to new heights with such recent triumphs as Shrek and Finding Nemo. The final shot is a wondrous, memorable end that recalls the transformation scene in Disney's classic, Beauty and the Beast. In fact, so good is its animation and technique that it is easy to forgive any shortcomings in what is basically a one act, one note story albeit told with sincerity. With just a bit more pathos and storyline, Burton's team would have had an instant classic. It's a near miss, but its status as the best animated film of the year is secure.",9,84,111,26 September 2005
American Hustle," American HUSTLE -the Art of Seduction and Survival
","Suggested by actual events of the Abscam sting in the 1970s, the FBI plans to setup and arrest corrupt politicians. How they get the officials and the professional con artists that help the sting operation are the basis of a nostalgic film. As directed and co-written by David O. Russell (Silver Linings Playbook, The Fighter), American Hustle is an acting clinic highlighting a convoluted tale of men and women who are looking for a big score.In 1978, ambitious FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), forces con man Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) and his mistress, Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), to help arrange a con on white collar crime, specifically targeting corrupt politicians. Richie wants to make a name for himself, and he is immediately attracted to Sydney and has designs on her beyond the con. Starting with a local, beloved mayor, Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), high level political figures are drawn in, and there is the possible organized crime connection. Further, Irving's wife, Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence), threatens to derail the sting. As Richie's grand plan comes together, things get more complicated and risky, and Irving and Sydney must rely on their skills to survive.These are very well etched characters. Each has something to gain, and each has an angle to exploit, whether it's Richie's dreams of a big bust or Rosalyn's threats to expose the operation. Kindred souls and survivors, Irving and Sydney have mastered the art of deception and manipulation. You feel a degree of sympathy for Irving despite his criminal past and his marital discord. Not only does he love his women, but he tries to save a friend from jail. Irving turns out to be someone to root for. In fact the world is not black and white especially when an FBI agent breaks the rules and gets involved with one of the principals. Carmine is the noble, elected official who truly believes in doing good for his community. Just who are the good guys and bad guys? Just who is conning who? Memorable scenes include a catty confrontation in a women's restroom, the face off between Richie and his beleaguered boss (played to great effect by Louis C. K.), and an incredibly tense meeting with a head mobster (Robert DeNiro in a lethal cameo).Acting is superior throughout as expected in a Russell ensemble with the principals at the top of their game. Bale transforms his physical appearance as an overweight, balding schlep (a far cry from The Dark Knight's Batman). A sultry Adams (Doubt, Her) has a great time playing a kindred con artist with a British accent. Cooper (Limitless, The Hangover) has a ball as the gung ho agent with a 1970s perm who will step over his boss to get his time in the sun. Lawrence (The Hunger Games, Winter's Bone) excels as the wife who exhibits a bold brashness in public which delights her onlookers but risks blowing the sting.There is liberal use of 1970's pop songs which blend with the costumes and hair styles seamlessly. The camera work is fluid and is reminiscent of early Martin Scorsese films. There is a very carefree attitude in the film's look and feel which is consistent with this loose, uninhibited decade.A slice of the seventies with freewheeling hustlers and loose morals, at its core, American Hustle is a love story centering on Irving, an imperfect con artist and the women in his life. The film is essentially a con within a con and keeps you guessing until the end. Although the film's narrative is not as tight as it could have been, Russell has sacrificed a tiny bit of substance for style. Do admire this film for the many scenes that pit flawed characters against each other. Acting does not get much better than this.",9,2,8,1 March 2014
The Aviator," The Aviator Flies High
","Billionaire Howard Hughes is the subject of an epic biography, The Aviator, and it is just big enough to encompass the early adult years of a reclusive, eccentric original who battles the doubters and his own inner demons. Spearheaded by Leonardo DiCaprio, who plays Hughes, this project started with Michael Mann (who remains a producer) and was ushered to realization by director Martin Scorsese.The film wisely settles on Hughes' life particularly between 1927 and 1947. A brief opening scene shows Hughes as a boy being washed by his mother while preaching quarantine and cleanliness. Cut to Hughes in the late 1920's as a young man with a tool company in Texas who is trying to film a large scale war film, Hell's Angels. A perfectionist, Hughes is determined to capture great aerial scenes no matter the time and cost. He hires Noah Dietrich (John C. Reilly) to watch the company's finances as he begins to explore the limits of airplane design and travel. He discovers a young starlet, Jean Harlow, and begins romancing some of Hollywood's female glamour stars like Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner. Gradually, his compulsive disorders worsen and are complicated by his failed relationships and a couple of near fatal air disasters. His urge to fly and create bigger and faster planes puts him on a collision course with a competitor from Pan Am and ultimately the U.S. Congress.While Howard Hughes' life has been the stuff of movie material for decades, this big budget film finally marshals the appropriate talent and resources to do it justice. Previously, 1964's The Carpetbaggers seemed inspired by Hughes' film career. In 1977, a TV movie called The Amazing Howard Hughes featuring Tommy Lee Jones did a good job of spanning his life. Even the fanciful comedy/drama Melvin and Howard played on a thread of Hughes' supposed encounter with a stranger. Yet it took the combined might of Miramax and Warner Brothers to give the story the needed blockbuster budget. And if having Scorsese direct a biography is like asking Picasso to do a Superman comic, then so be it. He does an admirable job of depicting intimate scenes and set pieces intermixed with period and story. It is a solid piece of storytelling by a master director working off a good script by John Logan (Gladiator).What is compelling about Hughes is how reckless and human he was while at the same time becoming a sympathetic victim of his afflictions. As his ticks and behavior become increasingly obsessive, there is a genuine sense of inevitability as we watch the beginnings of his legendary, sanitized lifestyle to come. The scenes involving his clash with the U.S. Senate are like watching a newsreel come to life. It is fascinating stuff even as we are rooting for Hughes to prevail. In the end, Hughes is a slice of the American Dream crossed with the American Tragedy.DiCaprio is quite good as the aviator and while those that remember the real Hughes may never have dreamed of young Leonardo playing this role, he has embodied the spirit and behavior quite convincingly; he gets the feel and angst of the man. In the latter half of the film, he looks like a dead ringer for Hughes right down to his arched eyebrow.The rest of the supporting cast is strong. Cate Blanchett is excellent as Katharine Hepburn. She not only has Kate's appearance and vocal quality down, but she has made her a vivid, intelligent human whose relationship with Hughes is the focus for much of his life. This is no mere cardboard impersonation. Kate Beckinsale plays Ava Gardner and does credible job in a role which is also important in Hughes' later life. Alan Alda is a standout as an unscrupulous U.S. Senator who is a henchman for air exec, Alec Baldwin. Even the smaller parts are a hoot with such stars as Jude Law playing Errol Flynn and Gwen Stefani as Jean Harlow. Willem Dafoe (The Last Temptation of Christ) has a bit role of a tabloid writer.As said before, the production is big and splashy. The set designs are top notch from nightclub recreations to air hangars to a congressional hearing room. Costume design (Sandy Powell-Gangs of New York) is like Edith Head reborn. The dramatic musical score (Howard Shore-The Lord of the Rings) is unobtrusive and well integrated in the story. Cinematography (Robert Richardson-Casino) and editing (Thelma Schoonmaker-Raging Bull) in a Scorsese film is always imaginative and unique without calling self attention. The air scenes whether in Hells Angels or the test flights are exhilarating and through live action and special effects, recall some of the exciting moments of The Right Stuff. What are just as impressive are the details in this larger than life production. For example, when Hughes emerges from a self imposed quarantine, his staffers are going about their work wearing white gloves. Film purists will enjoy the clips or references to other Hughes productions like Scarface (1932) and The Outlaw.Ultimately, this ambitious tale is not only well told, but you get a true sense of the man, and that is no mean feat. Sure, the film is lengthy and drags a little in the second half as it probes his illness, but it isn't long before another scene picks up the plot, and the film moves to a grand scale again. It has been a good year in 2004 for movie biographies, and while The Aviator is the biggest of the bunch it is also one of the best.***1/2 out of **** stars",Null,1,4,9 January 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Not the perfect ending but repeated viewing may be in order
","Matrix Revolutions is not the ideal ending to the cyber hip saga of a Messiah amid a ruling machine world and simulated reality.  Moviegoers need to remember that the first Matrix was fresh and unique, a hard act to follow without seemingly rehashing or repeating certain imagery and themes.
The race to save Zion from Sentinels and the self discovery by Neo of his destiny are the compelling reasons to watch this film. There are subplots involving a rescue of Neo by Trinity and the final confrontation between Neo and Smith.  There are spectacular battle scenes the likes which may never be duplicated again on this scale for decades to come.  Neo and Smith show how super heroes may battle in future films via astounding effects.  The Oracle figures strongly here courtesy of Mary Alice who does a credible job taking over from the late Gloria Foster.What are the problems with this film that has critics and fans underwhelmed? The effects do seem to overwhelm at times and there is a feeling that the answers to the burning questions from Reloaded are not sufficiently addressed in more than cryptic fashion.  And, of course, there is a pressing demand for a higher wow factor (or at least a satisfying bookend )which is virtually impossible to meet. Now this is not unheard of-see Star Wars, Back to the Future, and I suspect Lord of the Rings.Should you go see this epic? Yes, and it will entertain you.  But do not expect anything more than what it will give you. Allow it to unfold in its own fashion.  The Matrix, while special, was a good film that improved upon repeated viewing via DVD-it is perhaps one of the most successful DVD films in history.  Reloaded is not the dog it has been made out to be once you see the DVD a few times.  I suspect Revolutions may benefit similarly.  But no question the original is still the best.  Now go enjoy.",Null,0,0,5 November 2003
Man of Steel," Man of Steel Sets the Stage for New Adventures
","DC Comics has rivaled and preceded Marvel Comics for many decades with its roster of super heroes and is now attempting to reestablish their greatest character, Superman. Having been previously depicted in movies and television, Man of Steel is the biggest production to date. Is it any good, and is it better than Superman Returns? Yes and yes. Despite a darker tone, (courtesy of the creative tandem of producer Christopher Nolan and writer David Goyer from The Dark Knight films and director Zach Snyder of Watchmen), this adventure is an entertaining action piece with a deep psychological subtext. The planet Krypton is dying, and scientist Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and his wife Lara launch a spacecraft to send their newborn son, Kal-El, to a promising world, Earth. General Zod (Michael Shannon), whose attempted coup is thwarted, is banished into a wormhole. When Krypton is destroyed, Kal-El lands on earth, and through a series of flashback vignettes, we see the school boy named Clark struggling with growing pains and the values instilled by his adoptive human parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (Kevin Costner and Diane Lane) who try to hide his superhuman strength and abilities. As an adult, Clark (Henry Cavill) takes a series of jobs and remains anonymous, off the grid until odd reports begin to circulate of a mysterious man who saves lives with remarkable powers which brings reporter Lois Lane (Amy Adams) hot on his trail. The setting shifts from the cornfields of Midwest America to Metropolis. As General Zod reappears to claim earth for his race, the stage is set for a grand battle with the fate of the world in the hands of a true blue hero.There are some fine moments such as the young Clark befriending a former bully and being repaid in kind. There is the tornado scene that brings Clark's non-use of his powers to a turning point. Later, when the military first meet Superman and question his intentions, he responds by rescuing scores of people and is vindicated in a touching moment. This Superman (with more than a passing parallel with Jesus) is depicted as an emotionally vulnerable soul, and although he possesses great powers and invincibility, he does feel pain especially when meted out by his own kind. The whole film is ultimately a moral struggle and contrast between two fathers and whether their son's powers are meant for good or to be kept hidden no matter what the cost. It's also about his personal journey to find his purpose amid a normal life and search for his origins. Can he embody the best of both worlds, and to what lengths will Superman go to save humanity? Cavill is quite convincing as Superman, certainly an improvement on Brandon Routh's turn in Superman Returns. Adams shows a thoroughly capable yet vulnerable Lane, a strong reporter and Pulitzer Prize winner to boot! Her scenes with Superman work quite well especially in the quieter, intimate moments which one hopes will lead to much more in future installments.The supporting cast excels. Crowe lends gravitas to a subordinate role, and he registers every time he appears. Diane Lane is good as the compassionate Momma Kent. (Ironically Lane starred in Hollywoodland about TV's Superman, George Reeves). Costner makes a strong impression as the resolute, adoptive dad who is willing to risk his life for a principal. Laurence Fishburne is a more three-dimensional Perry White, and Christopher Meloni is effective as a hardnosed military commander.Special visual effects have come a long way since 1978's Superman when the slogan was, 'You'll Believe a Man Can Fly!' Some of the effects show incredibly fast motion which makes you wonder how cool it would be to realize such DC Comic characters as The Flash. While Hans Zimmer has the appropriate, heroic musical score in place here, John Williams truly memorable theme song is a hard act to follow.The action is not the cartoon variety; people do get hurt and some perish. Regarding that final battle in the streets of Metropolis (previously depicted in Superman II), enough already! We've seen The Avengers decimate New York City and The Transformers wreak havoc on a massive scale. These scenes are becoming old hat (even in a post 9/11 world), and are starting to seem repetitive overkill. Don't get me started on the obvious product placement; when it begins to be noticeable, it becomes annoying. Perhaps the only disappointment here is the lack of much humor or lightheartedness. There are a couple funny moments; the film could have used a few more. One hopes a lighter tone is in store for the next chapter. Maybe we will see Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen who are both missing here. You barely see Clark Kent get his gig at The Daily Planet before the credits roll. Oh, and contrary to the Marvel films, do not bother staying through the credits in hope of a post credit tease. The film's greatest accomplishment is setting a strong foundation for the next Superman adventure and possibly the beginnings of a Justice League of America (emulating Marvel's The Avengers). Wouldn't that be cool?",8,1,3,26 June 2013
Hugo," A Genius Is Rediscovered in HUGO
","Martin Scorsese has a deep love for movie history and film preservation. Both passions are imbued in Hugo, a charming tale of a child's personal search that leads to a treasure of memories and redemption.At a Paris train station in 1931 a young boy, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives a solitary existence. The train inspector (Sacha Baron Cohen) lurks about looking for stray children to send to the local orphanage. One day Hugo notices an elderly watchmaker (Ben Kingsley) who sits lonely and silent. Joined by a curious girl, Isabelle (Chloe Grace Moretz), the two join forces to investigate the old man and learn that there is much more to him than meets the eye. Add to this a mysterious mechanical man built by Hugo's father and known as an automaton whose cryptic writings may provide clues to the past. But how to unlock these secrets? What the young couple finds will lead them back to the old man as there seem to be a surprising connection, and through the old man, a remarkable past is rejuvenated that will harken back to the birth of movies.As the mysterious, old man, Ben Kingsley provides the gravitas to flesh out a character that at first seems dull and lonely, whose past catches up and reveals a lifetime of hope and genius heretofore forgotten by the public until Hugo and Isabelle rediscover it. The kids are well cast although Hugo comes across a bit of an oddball whereas Isabelle is a sweet girl who compliments him. Cohen, quite effective in a villainous role, is properly mean and threatening until he has a change of heart near the end, and you wish there had been more of him because his character evolves toward the end.In fact the whole heart concept permeates Hugo. There is the budding love between Hugo and Isabelle, the old man's romance in his past, and even the hint of love from a flower girl. There is the heart shaped key that unlocks the automaton's mechanism. The automaton serves as a static character, a kind of Pinocchio in scenes where Hugo talks to it in the absence of his father. Above all, it's all about a love for movies past and present.It is clear how much Scorsese loves movies in smaller, intimate scenes as when Hugo and Isabelle sneak into a Harold Lloyd film or when he shows snippets from earlier moving images. The main thrust of Hugo's plot provides Scorsese the excuse to restage classic kinescope and film clips. It's like reliving history. Film buffs will love these moments as Scorsese lovingly and painstakingly recreates early silent film. We see history and magic being made simultaneously! A minor problem with the film is that it feels a bit uneven at times, and you never feel fully engaged with the characters as much as you want to be. Hugo and his friend Isabelle should be the focus all the way, but the film seems to occasionally stray from their journey. As a couple, they are more tentative and reserved than Harry Potter and his friend Hermione in the Harry Potter series. It lacks a strong emotional center. One wonders how a director like Steven Spielberg or Tim Burton would have interpreted the story.Technical and production quality are superb. This is a fully realized fantasy world especially with the overall design and art direction and costumes within the train station and immediate neighborhood. Even the visual effects work well within the story without being a distraction.The film does works for both children and adults. Hugo in a way represents the painful and joyous past that people keep hidden until it is released by patience and love.",8,3,4,24 February 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," a worthy sequel rejuvenates the series
","Jonathan Mostow did a decent action film U-571, and he basically weaved together a pretty darn good action film here in T3 and an homage to the previous James Cameron classics. In fact it would be hard pressed for anyone to have made a better sequel! Film starts about ten years after events of T2 with an adult John Connor (well played by Nick Stahl) who by fate intersects with former schoolmate Kate Brewster (Claire Danes also quite good). Enter the Terminatrix who is a bad ass female top-of-the-line cyborg who can do the liquid metal thing and ALSO control other machines. In fact, the whole premise of the movie's title is faithfully developed as the dreaded Skynet (alluded to in the first films) begins to take shape as a new defense net with some bugs to work out. Arnold Schwarzenegger returns as the original Terminator sent back in time to rescue Connor AND Brewster! The plot thickens a bit to a surprising conclusion that is open for, dare I say-T4?Special effects are outstanding. The $170 million budget is all up there. And there are some cute references to the previous films with Arnold getting the best lines and retorts.  He looks great and does what amounts to a comeback film.  The pace of the film is steady and interesting. In fact,unless you were a hardcore fan, the average moviegoer might not detect that almost none of the principals of the first two films signed for this one. OK, James Cameron set the bar very high especially with T2, but you have to give credit to a fine effort here. Kudos to the filmmakers for making a satisfying film on its own merits and succeeding where others this summer have not.",Null,0,0,1 July 2003
Silver Linings Playbook," The Game of Life in SILVER LININGS PLAYBOOK
","Director David O. Russell (Three Kings) has taken Matthew Quick's novel, Silver Linings Playbook, and adapted it for the screen. It is a topic near and dear to him as his own son has bipolar disorder like the lead character. By balancing dramatic situations with comedic overtones, Russell has accomplished a rare feat, an excellent drama with a superior cast that treads the fine line of humor. By making such a delicate subject accessible to the masses, he has made a really entertaining, crowd pleaser.Pat (Bradley Cooper) suffers from bipolar disorder and, following a breakdown over a failed marriage and confinement to a psychiatric facility in Baltimore, has just been released to his parents' care. Now back in Philadelphia and living with his parents, Dolores (Jacki Weaver), his doting mother, and Pat, Sr. (Robert DeNiro), a sports addict, Pat is determined to get his wife back despite a restraining order. He is so obsessed with getting back with his wife that he boils over on occasion with emotional outbursts which threaten to send him back to confinement. When he is not taking his meds or visiting his therapist, he runs in his neighborhood to get into shape in anticipation of repatriating with his wife, or so he thinks. One day he runs into Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), another troubled soul who not only has been widowed recently, but now sleeps with anyone. Their uneasy interactions lead to an unusual offer by Tiffany for him to partner with her in a dance contest in exchange for her being an intermediary and backdoor link to his wife. What follows are the revelations of emotional scars and the realities of finding happiness in the most unlikely places.The cast is excellent, particularly the four lead actors. Lawrence portrays Tiffany as a seemingly naïve, young woman, but she turns out to be a bright, perceptive person who is not afraid to stand toe-to-toe with anyone. DeNiro has not had such a strong role in many years, and he shows just how good he still is. Even Chris Tucker, in an unusual supporting role, registers as Pat's buddy from his psych group.The film is about how people, who are trapped in their own patterns of behavior, are afraid or unable to reach out and take a chance in life. The depictions of mental illness are portrayed with realism. When Pat undergoes mood swings, it can manifest itself as uncontrollable rage brought on by a simple trigger. He has no filter to his reactions and responses which can be quite awkward and downright offensive. Much as Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as It Gets laments if 'this really is as good as it gets', Cooper's Pat tries to find the 'silver lining' in his life.It is interesting to note that virtually every major character in the story has emotional issues in varying degrees. At one point Pat actually thinks Tiffany is crazier than he is. Pat's father, a superstitious gambler and bookie, has his own issues with obsessive-compulsive disorder. His belief that having his son nearby to ensure the Eagles football team a victory, leads to an amusing confrontation with Tiffany.When you have a cast that is this good, you have to look at the director, Russell, who orchestrates like a master conductor. Despite an uneven filmography in his early career, he is rapidly becoming the actors' go-to director. His attention to minor details like the simple act of tying a tie, a quick reaction shot, or hand gesture enriches the texture of a characterization. His recent films (The Fighter) have taken noteworthy, acting ensembles and elicited superior, Oscar worthy performances amid strong story lines. Somewhere, directing legends, George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story) and William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives), are smiling broadly.",10,2,3,10 March 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN is Naughty Fun
","Steve Carell has been a fixture on Comedy Central for years and had scene stealing minor roles in feature films like Anchorman and Bruce Almighty, but with his first starring role as The 40 Year Old Virgin, he has struck pay dirt. Although crude in its humor and at times graphic in its display of sexual conduct, the film has a core story that elevates it above most gross out comedies and does keep the funny lines coming fast enough to amuse most.Andy Stitzer, a painfully shy 40 year old, works as a service tech at an electronic entertainment showroom. He is friends with three salesmen who soon find during a poker game that Andy is a virgin, never having had sex with a woman before. It seems Andy never got around to that experience although his attempts are hilariously recalled. Because Andy is humiliated and embarrassed at the barbs and jokes at his expense, his buddies band together to help their fledgling. The aid comes in the forms of speed dating, roaming the singles bars, hitting on book store clerks, and propositioning the showroom's customers where Andy meets an attractive woman, Trish (Catherine Keener), a single mother who has a small business. The two instantly hit it off, but when it comes time to consummate the relationship, things go awry and Andy becomes more despondent when he cannot bear to reveal his deep secret to the woman he loves. It's time for a momentous decision in Andy's life.Carell co produced and stars in what is his pet project. Judd Apatow (The Larry Sanders Show) directs the script he co-wrote with Carell. True, some of the jokes crash and burn badly or misfire and fizzle, but enough keeps coming to raise some good roaring fun. As Andy, Carell plays an everyman kind of role, and his friends who on surface seem like chauvinistic frat boys, do care and come to his aid in an endearing spirit. He is so adept at the nuances and exaggerated movements of physical comedy that he needs to exploit them further (as he will in the big screen remake of the TV spy show, Get Smart). Among the numerous scenes, the standout and most talked about one is the infamous hair removal at a waxing clinic where Andy attempts to make himself more physically appealing. The results are disastrous, and it is well known that Carell performed the scene for real and suffered for his 'art'. Catherine Keener is a breath of fresh air and quite appealing in her realistic role of a single mother looking for love in the most unlikely of places. The relationship between Trish and Andy develops earnestly and serves to anchor the sillier aspects of the storyline. And there is silly aplenty with some outrageous lines of dialogue and vulgar asides. In some ways, this is about a man who finds his own sense of manhood and maturity after being a boy for a long time. There are subplots involving each of the guys that are amusing but don't really add anything to the story. Also good is the developing relationship Andy has with Trish's daughter. The final scene is pretty nutty and clever as the credits roll.On the surface, this film would appear to have all the ingredients for an over-the-top comedy like Animal House or American Pie. Indeed, there are a couple of scenes that are quite sexually explicit. It takes its R rating seriously. Don't be misled. This is not a one note comedy but rather a romantic tale. At its heart, it has a well intentioned theme of longing and frustration with some genuine compassion. If you go in knowing you may be grossed out at times but still induced to laughter, then that pretty much sums up the appeal of this energetic film. In a star making turn, Carell is one to watch for quite some time.",8,0,1,12 October 2005
Jarhead," JARHEAD's Dogs of War
","The first Gulf War in Iraq has been an occasional subject matter of films, but not until Jarhead has a bona fide story emerged which captures the experience and heartache as told by director Sam Mendes. Although Mendes has never been able to match the heights of American Beauty, he does an effective job of making the audience a participant in the rigors of desert warfare.Raw recruits are thrust into rough, basic training (at times with tragic results) as they are prepared for duty in Iraq. Among them are Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Troy (Peter Sarsgaard). Drill Sgt. Siek (Jamie Foxx) whips the young men into soldiers as they are deployed in the Persian Gulf with the imminent threat of war. This is a rough life with constant humiliation and hazing. Then comes Operation Desert Shield with the endless training, waiting, monotony, and more time away from family and home where wives and girlfriends lose touch or stray. Such is the hapless life of the grunt. A hostile terrain such as dirty oil fields adds to the isolation and need for rebellious acts to mitigate frustration. Swofford and Troy are groomed to be snipers, and when their opportunity comes in Operation Desert Storm, they are more than ready until they are dealt an unexpected turn of events.The recurring phrase or motif in the film is 'Welcome to the suck.' That about sums up what these men are put through. Adapted by William Broyles Jr. from Swofford's own real life experiences, it is an uncompromising recreation of 'the suck'. Mendes is content to show you what it was like but never dwells on any one scene longer than needed to get his point across.Told essentially from his point of view, the film opens and closes with a telling monologue by Swofford that sums up his experience. He and Troy form the nucleus of the film's conscience and soul. Swofford made the mistake of signing up while Troy is the ironic soldier who wants to fight a war but is thwarted by bureaucracy. The film does ring true in its depiction of the preparation for warfare with the heavy toll it takes on the soldiers and their personal lives. Periodically, an on screen tag will appear to list the number of days the surging numbers of troops were in Iraq (5000 troops increases to 575,000 troops in 175 days), which helps put the events in perspective. This film demythologizes war and instead presents war as a difficult and often life changing experience resulting not from actual combat, but from the tedium and loneliness.It is important to note that although Swofford shows a dislike for this man's army, he continues to do as he is told. This apolitical film does not really take a stance on the war. We really don't get enough background on Swofford or Troy to understand what makes these men tick. Rather, we are left with what they experience and how they respond on a superficial level. Troy comes across as inconsistent and his motivations are questionable. While the evolution of their relationship doesn't always make sense, the film still packs an emotional punch. About two-thirds through, the film's momentum begins to lose some steam and direction. There is also a sad event toward the end that is never fully explained.Gyllenhaal (Proof, Donnie Darko) is showing good maturity as an actor, and Sarsgaard (Kinsey) is effective as his closest buddy. Jamie Foxx (Ray) registers quite convincingly as the leader of this bunch. Dennis Haysbert and Chris Cooper have short but effective moments as commanding officers with axes to grind.Although movies have been set in the Iraqi conflict like Three Kings, this film deals directly with the soldiers who must do the dirty work. In some ways this film shares a pedigree with an ensemble piece like Battleground. There are allusions to the Vietnam War particularly at the end involving a Vietnam veteran and also in clips from Vietnam movies like Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter. The early drills recall some of the most harrowing moments from Full Metal Jacket with the verbal insults and discipline. In fact, some of the vicious lines are hysterically funny. It's certainly a far cry from An Officer and Gentlemen. Like the soldiers at the beginning of Born on the Fourth of July, they go in wide eyed, full of optimism, and ready for action. Instead, what they find is something that beats their spirits down. In a way, the structure of vignettes and random incidents is similar to The Big Red One without the periodic voice-over. Pop songs of the era are matched perfectly to scenes. Technical aspects are good including the camera work and editing. There are some memorable images including an eerie scene where the patrol comes upon a charred caravan of vehicles with burned, Iraqi people.Jarhead is not a perfect film, but it is well acted and pulls no punches on what it must have been like in Iraq. Those looking for an action packed war film will be severely disappointed and let down. Except for some character inconsistencies, it is a realistic study in the psychological toll that military life takes on a human being.",7,2,3,15 November 2005
Collateral," Collateral keeps things on edge
","Director Michael Mann delivers in the guise of an urban thriller, an intriguing character study of contrast between good and evil in Collateral. Tom Cruise changes pace by playing a hitman with a nasty streak, and Jamie Foxx has the straight man role as a cab driver.  Essentially a Hitchcockian premise with a perverse twist, the film begins with Foxx as the innocent bystander-type working one night driving his taxi who picks up Cruise without realizing that the two are embarking on a methodical murder of five targets.  Gradually, the L.A. police led by Mark Ruffalo realize that the growing pile of bodies is connected to a taxicab.  While it goes on a bit too long at one point, Collateral picks up steam in the last one-third of the film and sustains a strong level of suspense and angst as Foxx races against time to prevent one last murder that hits close to home. 
Even with a plot that is quite simple, Mann uses Los Angeles to paint a large canvas in much the way directors Martin Scorsese and Sidney Lumet utilize New York City as almost a third character.  All of the trademark glitz and glitter in cinematography and imaginative editing we have come to expect from Mann are on display.  Has it really been almost two decades since TV's Miami Vice?  As expected, contemporary dance music and evocative mood instrumentals flesh out the scenes effectively.  Mann has always demonstrated a strong command of soundtrack music.  Collateral shares some of the same pedigree as his earlier heist epic, Heat.  In both films, a basic plotline is heightened by interesting character contrasts between two men-one good and the other bad. Although the dialogue between Foxx and Cruise is the crux of the film, it ranges from witty to intense to mediocre at times. One wishes the script had one more pass to punch it up so that by the time the finale rolls around, there is a bit more poignancy and irony which the filmmakers surely intended.  There are a few lapses of logic and credibility especially toward the end but the story moves along sufficiently to keep one engaged.
Cruise is effective as a baddie, but it is Foxx who shines in a more challenging role.  He had a memorable turn in Oliver Stone's football epic, Any Given Sunday, and here he is given ample room to broaden his range as an actor.  It is certain that he will attain more dramatic roles in the future. Jada Pinkett Smith, as an attorney who has a fateful encounter with Foxx, rounds out a solid cast.   Given that the action sequences are brutal yet brief, it is remarkable that for the most part, the film sustains its fatalistic mood and tension while entertaining the audience with its two lead characters.  Tom Cruise fans will find this a curious footnote in his filmography and Michael Mann followers will soak up the riches of his filmmaking prowess.  Collateral is a feast for the eyes and ears with just enough substance and character in between.",Null,0,0,6 August 2004
The Amazing Spider-Man," The Amazing Spider-Man Re-Tingles the Franchise
","For the past decade, Marvel Comics has been churning out film versions of its iconic super heroes, but in this case, Spiderman, only a decade before, had been rendered successfully by director Sam Raimi. Well, a poor third film meant a re-imagining of the franchise, and as The Hulk and Batman series have shown, studios are willing to try to reclaim a tentpole blockbuster. The risk can be a marginal failure as in Superman Returns. Not so here. With well cast leads and strong supporting roles, The Amazing Spider-Man is quite entertaining especially toward the end, and it displays emotional resonance that enhances its storyline.Young Peter Parker (Andrew Garfield) lives with his Aunt May (Sally Field) and Uncle Ben (Martin Sheen) after his parents abandoned him as a child. Now an awkward, bullied high school student, he has a crush on cute blonde, Gwen Stacy (Emma Stone), who has an authoritarian father (Denis Leary). Upon discovering his dad's old files, Peter seeks out his father's former colleague, Dr. Curt Connors (Rhys Ifans), who is researching the regenerative, healing capabilities of reptiles in his lab at Oscorp. Parker snoops around the lab and gets bitten by a genetically enhanced spider, and soon he begins to develop superhuman strength, agility, reflexes, and the ability to crawl on walls as well as shoot a powerful web. His self absorption sets in motion events that will exact personal loss. Guilt stricken, he becomes a masked avenger, catching criminals much to the chagrin of the police who think he is a vigilante. Meanwhile, a desperate Connors is forced to test a serum on himself which transforms him into the Lizard who menaces the city streets and threatens to infect the entire population with the chemical. As Spiderman confronts The Lizard in a grand battle, the fate of the city including Gwen hangs in the balance.How does this compare to the previous Spiderman? It's nearly as good but with a different take and still retains the essential ingredients that made the former film a standout. The film always keeps the focus on the relationships between Peter and Gwen and Peter and his family. Those grounded bonds form the soul of the film and make the film a more enriching experience. There is no Mary Jane Watson or J. Jonah Jameson yet.The filmmakers, director Marc Webb (500 Days of Summer) and screenwriters James Vanderbilt (Zodiac), Alvin Sargent (Ordinary People), and Steve Kloves (Harry Potter series) made the smart choice of starting with a younger version of Peter Parker, perfectly embodied by Garfield, whose adolescence and psychology are part of a fully realized character. Garfield and Stone make an adorable couple and display good chemistry that is endearing. Fields and Sheen are quite effective as Peter's guardians and the screen lights up whenever they appear. Leary, proving he can do drama as well as comedy, makes the most of his role as Stacy's dad who is a police captain in conflict over the rogue Spiderman. Marvel legend Stan 'the Man' Lee has another amusing cameo.Although bereft with open ended plot points by film's end (likely to be resolved in future sequels), there are a couple of nice touches that lift this film above most standard comic book adaptations. In one particularly affecting scene, a construction worker rallies a team of crane operators to assist Spiderman, whose earlier courageous act now pays timely dividends. During the rousing climax, Spiderman is rescued when an unlikely savior intercedes. Even Connors' Lizard is not your stereotypic villain and figures in a surprising and unexpected act at film's end.Special effects were pretty good in the older Spiderman, but they are even better here especially in the trademark web swinging between skyscrapers. If the musical score sounds like a cross between A Beautiful Mind and Aliens, it's because James Horner does the honors on each film.Despite the odds, what is 'amazing' is that lightning has struck twice for the franchise. The Amazing Spider-Man is a familiar yet refreshing take on a formula that works quite well here. And yes, stay for the end credits which reveal a teaser for the next film.",8,1,3,14 July 2012
Dallas Buyers Club," The Art of Survival in DALLAS BUYERS CLUB
","The fact it supposedly took nearly twenty years to bring the true story of Ron Woodroof to the screen is a somber fact which has not muted its impact over time. This heart wrenching chronicle of one man's desperate attempts against all odds features marvelous performances by Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto.It is 1985 in Dallas, Texas, and rodeo rider, Ron Woodroof (Matthew McConaughey), has an accident and ends up in the hospital where he learns he has the HIV virus which causes AIDs, a death sentence which, according to his doctor, gives him thirty days to live and put his affairs in order. Stunned by the news, which heretofore was a sexually transmitted disease among homosexuals, Ron learns the grim truth about AIDs, a growing global epidemic. What's worse is the lack of any effective treatment even as trials for the experimental drug AZT begin via the Food and Drug Administration. Frustrated by ineffective drugs and running out of time, Ron takes matters in his own hands and begins to research the disease and travels to Mexico and other exotic locations for possible answers. He tries drug and vitamin combinations, a kind of AIDs cocktail, and begins to sell these to others. He even finds a way to circumvent the law forbidding his selling drugs by offering memberships. Helped by a fellow AIDs patient, Rayon (Jared Leto), his 'clinic' sees an explosion in membership as his cocktail gains in popularity. As the FDA and the IRS attempt to shut down his operation, he wages a one man fight against the forces that would close his enterprise and a hope for AIDs patients.It is interesting that the world has come a long way in the treatment and survivability of AIDs, but back then there were severely limited resources. Also the stigma and intolerance of being gay was more pronounced. Ron's homophobic reactions evolve over time in a very convincing, realistic way, and he is affected and transformed to the point where he even takes on Rayon as an unlikely business partner and even friend. That relationship, that unlikely pairing, is what makes the story fascinating and at times poignant.That it took a deadly malady to give his a life purpose and definition is the supreme irony. By no means a saint, he has casual sex partners when he isn't snorting cocaine or boozing it up, and when he isn't scamming a buck, utters a plethora of profanities when it suits him. He is a survivor and hustler who proves his resourcefulness in obtaining his drugs and vitamins even resorting to disguises, schmoozing, and legal maneuvering.McConaughey (Contact, The Lincoln Lawyer) lost as much as 47 pounds for this role to depict the AIDs ravaged survivor; it's the role of a lifetime. Leto (Requiem for a Dream) equally excels as the transvestite and drug addict who befriends Ron and provides a window into the world of gays and more potential clients. Jennifer Garner registers a strong performance as a sympathetic doctor caught between treatment controversies.You almost wish that the filmmakers (director Jean-Marc Vallée and screenwriters Craig Borten and Melisa Wallack) had expanded upon the machinations of the FDA and pharmaceutical drug companies which held sway over life and death particularly in a standout scene near the end as Ron confronts the FDA in front of an audience. But this is primarily an intimate portrayal of a rebel, one whose self discovery leads to remarkable action and a profound effect on many others.You do wish some of the plot lines had been more developed. For instance, Ron's police friend, Tucker, has a scene with his elderly father involving a drug; it would have been nice to develop that subplot which figures later when Ron needs help in a sticky situation.The film is a low budget production, but that enhances its realism. A bittersweet story full of the charm and vigor that McConaughey brings to Ron Woodroof, Dallas Buyers Club lingers long after its closing credits as a testament of an imperfect person in an impossible situation who left a memorable mark.",9,2,2,1 March 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," X MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST and Its Bold Mission
","These are remarkable times for Marvel comic fans as film effects have enabled story and imagination to produce a visually stunning, realistic experience. With X Men: Days of Future Past, a strong team of writers and director Bryan Singer have created a highly entertaining quasi-sequel/prequel which reinvents the X Men world from all the previous versions. A logistical challenge from the get go, this film has accomplished the near impossible and approaches the excellence of The Avengers.In a bleak vision of the future, mutants are being hunted down along with any human sympathizers by enhanced, robotic Sentinel hunters. With the last vestiges of hope at a remote location, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Erik Lehnsherr AKA Magneto (Ian McKellen) join forces in a last ditch effort to alter the timeline using Kitty Pryde's (Ellen Page) transferring powers to send Logan AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) back to his body in the 1970s. His desperate mission is to convince the younger Charles (James McAvoy) and Erik (Michael Fassbender) to stop Raven AKA Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence), from carrying out a vendetta against humans including a scientist named Dr. Trask (Peter Dinklage), who holds the key to the Sentinel army. However, tracking Raven is problematic while the younger Charles has lost his purpose having withdrawn into seclusion, and a young, embittered Erik is locked away for a significant crime. How Wolverine can 'put the band back together' is just the beginning of a convoluted storyline that not only involves time travel but exposing old, emotional wounds and the fleeting hope of salvation from a doomed future.From the opening 20th Century Fox fanfare with its highlighted 'X', you know Singer has got his mojo back (after the misfire of Superman Returns). Having started the current Marvel era of filmmaking with X Men (2000), he knows these characters better than anyone, and the screenplay has a strong narrative with some genuinely funny lines. Like X Men: First Class, this film crisscrosses the globe from Vietnam to Paris to Washington D.C., and much of the early period parallels actual historic events and figures as in Watchmen.Fate and destiny: can history be altered and can people change? The film has such a complex plot you wonder if it will shortchange the emotional content. It doesn't. In fact, you could almost have made this a two part film and expanded the possibilities. By trying to link the old with the new into one cohesive plot was challenge enough, but by sprinkling in bits of references to the Marvel canon and providing a great ending, comic fans should be giddy and thrilled. You don't have to have seen every X Men film, but it helps to enrich the experience for fans of Marvel lore by connecting a lot of dots.Once again, the interplay between the younger Charles and Erik forms the core of a paradoxical love/hate relationship. First, Charles must find his way back from his self-imposed exile amid personal loss, and then it becomes a fascinating triangle of wills; Raven may be the target, but Erik and Charles struggle for her soul. Stewart lends authority (as the older Charles) as he narrates in grim tones the opening sequence which has parallels (as in the first X Men) to the Holocaust and human intolerance.The large cast shines especially McAvoy and Lawrence, who gets to speak in Vietnamese much as Fassbender espoused German in First Class. You wish there were more of Stewart and McKellen, who are so good together, and despite relegating some cast members (including Halle Berry as Storm) to brief cameos or short scenes, plenty of familiar faces reappear from previous films to lend an air of continuity, and you feel the casts of both past and present are adequately represented.New characters are introduced with cool powers particularly Evan Peters as Quicksilver, whose rapid speed proves instrumental in the film's standout sequence that ranks up there with X 2's opening White House assault by Nightcrawler. The special effects are that good. Just watching the final showdown where the mutants utilize all their unique powers to do battle with the Sentinels is a treat. Mystique's special morphing powers are on full display along with her acrobatic fighting style, and Magneto's powers are dead on as he literally raises RFK Stadium when the action shifts to DC and The White House.Ambitious and well executed, X Men: Days of Future Past reaches the heights of X 2 and successfully merges two different universes both past and present, resets the timelines and events in a massive reboot, and results in a cohesive, entertaining story with an expanded, marquee cast. By applying equal parts reverence and boldness with the X Men mythology, Singer and company have accomplished a nearly impossible juggling act. With visionary directors like Joss Whedon (whose The Avengers is the gold standard) and Singer, the Marvel brand is likely to be an exemplary force of film entertainment for many years to come.(Yes, stay until the end of the credits for a brief, elaborate setup for the next film!)",9,1,2,11 June 2014
Alien vs. Predator," Alien vs. Predator plays like a video game
","Twentieth Century Fox has taken two of its most popular sci-fi franchises and paired them in a Super Bowl of monsters in Alien vs. Predator. The result is OK entertaining but ultimately a pale version of the original classics, Alien and Predator. It helps to get some useful perspective. The concept, while intriguing, is not entirely new. Quite recently, Jason (Friday the 13th series) and Freddy (the Nightmare on Elm Street) did battle as studios attempted to milk every last drop of revenue from waning sequels. Three-quarters of a century ago, Universal pictures became what would be the greatest horror film studio with Frankenstein, Dracula, Wolfman, The Mummy, and Creature from the Black Lagoon among others. When it became apparent that each franchise was running its course, the natural thought was to pair their monsters in a showdown. Most prominent was Frankenstein Meets Wolfman. So it is no wonder that a clip from that very film shows up at the beginning of Alien vs. Predator.Set on present day earth, a satellite detects a thermal event in Antarctica which triggers a hastily assembled scientific expedition financed by the Weyland Corporation. Its enigmatic head is Charles Bishop Weyland (Lance Henriksen) who wants to leave a legacy as his health begins to fail. Sanaa Lathan is the mountain climber/guide who leads the group to the thermal anomaly and discovers an ancient pyramid beneath the deep ice. Unfortunately, the explorers trigger a sequence of events including the birth of new Aliens via the dreaded facehuggers and the arrival of a group of Predator warriors ready for a new hunt. As the body count rises, the Aliens multiply in number and thus a battle royal is ready to commence. Will there be any humans left? How come nobody told the Nostromo crew in the first Alien movie about these critters? And what happened to the Henriksen character's namesake who reappears in the guise of Bishops 1 and 2 in later films? So many questions are left unanswered. The plot does have plenty of holes and glosses quickly, almost too quickly through the story as characters we barely get to know or want to care about quickly perish. Fans of both film series will appreciate the multitude of references to the Alien life cycle and Predator code. There are a couple of inconsistencies which may nag the purists such as the rapid maturation of the Aliens from egg to adult in record time, and the ease with which the dwindling humans understand the whole scenario. In fact, not only do the humans quickly realize who the Aliens are, namely the ultimate quarry for the Predator hunter warriors, but that human beings have been used like cattle to perpetuate the Aliens every 100 years as game for the returning Predator race. Note that the film Predator 2 hinted at this very concept with a brief glimpse of an Alien skull inside a Predator spaceship. Alien vs. Predator also serves as a kind of prequel to the Alien films and a kind of sequel to the Predator films in its timeline. Sanaa Lathan is actually good in the role of the guide and it is possible a better script and strong direction would have brought echoes of Ripley from the Alien films of old. The set design of the pyramid is fascinating though confusing with all of its ever changing mazes. The creature effects are not bad though reserved for the latter half of the movie. Director Paul W.S. Anderson (Event Horizon) does a serviceable job here and the PG 13 rating is designed for all those fans of the video games and comics featuring the Alien and Predator battles. Business should be brisk though limited to those loyalists who will find this installment diverting and certainly not the disappointment of Alien 3, or is it we've just lowered the bar a bit more?",Null,71,135,12 August 2004
No Country for Old Men," A Bold No Country for Old Men
","Starting with the film noir hit, Blood Simple, co-directors and screenwriters, Joel and Ethan Coen have had a productive output of auteur films that range from manic comedies (O Brother, Where Art Thou?, Raising Arizona) to thoughtful crime dramas (Fargo, Millers Crossing). With their latest, No Country for Old Men, they have excelled at personal film-making that just misses the mark by not delivering a more pronounced ending. Under the trappings of a mystery and then chase thriller, this film is an exercise in movie making at its best while taking chances with conventional characters and plot. It also features splendid performances by Josh Brolin and Javier Bardem. Set in 1980 after the Vietnam War, an aged sheriff, Ed Tom Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), talks of a long line of lawmen in his family. One day, in the desert a welder named Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) comes upon the remnants of a drug deal gone badly and a case of money and decides to take it. It turns out that some Mexicans are on his trail and mean business. So does a mysterious stranger, a clever, psychotic assassin, Anton (Javier Bardem). And the chase is on with Mexicans, the law, and worst of all, Anton, in pursuit. Moss sends his wife Carla to her mom's, and he hightails it to an obscure motel. Apparently a syndicate has hired Anton to get the money and dispatch anyone who gets in the way, but Anton has other ideas and begins to eliminate not just the Mexican competition, but nearly everyone connected with him! Anton's weapons of choice are a lethal air gun and the largest silencer rifle ever. He methodically hunts down Moss through detective work and a tracking device. You know that despite his resourcefulness, Moss is simply overmatched. Meanwhile, the syndicate hires another hit-man, Carson Wells (Woody Harrelson) to recover the money and eliminate Anton. All the while, Bell is adding up the clues and the growing trail of bodies to form an ominous picture of what is happening and what is to become. As much as he tries to help Moss and his wife, he cannot compete with the likes of Anton. By the end, Bell contemplates retirement knowing a killer is on the loose.Josh Brolin really makes a strong impression as the doomed Moss. His character reminds one of a younger Kris Kristofferson. Not since Michael Madsen in Reservoir Dogs has there been a hideously terrifying character as Bardem's hit-man, Anton. His calm, dispassionate killer is surely inspired by past movie villains as the ones in Point Blank and The Terminator. Yet, in his own strange way, Anton has his code and motivation. He even gives his potential victims a second chance based on random luck. And he is most unforgiving if he is crossed. There are a number of well constructed scenes to enjoy including a marvelous one at a convenience store which illustrates Anton's manic state, and a moment in a Mexican hotel that is unbearably tense as Moss is cornered in his room by someone who could be Anton.The cinematography by Roger Deakins (The Shawshank Redemption) is quite effective as it illustrates a desolate, barren landscape in which this cat and mouse game is played out.There are a couple problems with the films narrative, however. While it is good that the film attempts and mostly succeeds at being unique and offbeat, a few things are confusing like what really happens toward the end at a motel as Moss waits for his wife. What happens to the money? Some killings are off screen or suggested, and you have to make assumptions based on the context of a given scene.The abrupt conclusion is a bit baffling; it won't work for most audiences, and even the most ardent cinephile may need to digest the last several minutes to make sense of it. Pay attention to the film's underlying theme. Reread the title of the film and understand that it is about the tradition of the lawmen being displaced by a new world order. Jones does a voice over at the beginning and he concludes it with a melancholy lament and recounting of a disturbing dream. If only the structure of the film could convey that more clearly, there would have been a better narrative flow to its finale. Some may call the device brilliant, but it does not work as it may have been intended. But don't let this slip deny the pleasures of a marvelous ensemble of actors and some great camera-work. It could easily be the Coen brothers' best work to date, and that is something to truly appreciate.",8,2,4,24 February 2008
District 9," DISTRICT 9: Science Fiction as Allegory
","This film is an experiment in relatively low budget film-making based on an interesting concept. Peter Jackson (Lord of the Rings trilogy) acts as producer for newbie director Neill Blomkamp and a script by Blomkamp and Terri Tacthell to create an imaginative, powerful film whose DNA is civil strife in South Africa. Much as High Noon was about the Communist 'witch hunts' of the late 1940's and The Sand Pebbles was a corollary to the Vietnam War, District 9 smacks of Apartheid commentary in its home setting of Johannesburg, South Africa. The results are a well made science fiction film that integrates an important message.A government civil servant worker named Wikus Van De Merwe leads a relocation of an alien race dubbed 'The Prawns' from their current home in District 9 to a camp in a different part of South Africa. The military also wants to make use of the sophisticated alien weaponry that can only be operated by the aliens DNA. Wikus leads a group of soldiers into an alien camp and during the confrontation, he finds a mysterious vile that explodes when opened and splashes his face with an unknown substance. And quicker than you can say, The Fly, he starts to notice some startling changes as his body becomes nauseous and altered. A reunion at home with his wife and friends becomes a tragic start of something ominous and, when the military realizes the unlimited value of Wikus' genetic ability to operate the alien weaponry, he becomes a hunted fugitive. Trying to find refuge in the alien camp, he locates one of the aliens who concocted the substance. And the two devise a plan to steal the liquid now in military custody. The alien needs the material for his ship and, in exchange, he will help Wikus. Can he be trusted? How fast before Wikus changes completely? Back in District 9, the alien attempts to liftoff in his ship with his son, and Wikus has similar plans to escape. Soon the military catches up to them for an explosive climax. At that moment, Wikus makes a momentous decision that will change his life and the fate of his alien companion. The mostly unknown cast is uniformly excellent and capably led by Sharlto Copley as Wikus. Technical credits are superior particularly makeup and visual effects. Good use is made of a periodic timeline to show the passage of time and development of the events. Lots of hand-held cameras and lack of a musical score lend a feeling of immediacy and reality. Told in a quasi-documentary style through flashbacks and interviews, the film takes on a realistic aura grounded in truth. Rarely has a science fiction film (Cloverfield) ever been presented in this convincing manner. This is narrative driven and doesn't let up. Once it begins, you have to hang on for dear life. A number of topics are ever present throughout the film including segregation and racism, military dominance, and ultimately love. Do aliens have rights? Do they have a soul? It's a great premise for a film that the filmmakers take and expand upon. There is the use of private military contractors, and instead of oil, the resource the military seeks is superior technology in weaponry. The film has elements of other films like Alien Nation, Black Hawk Down and Starship Troopers. It's not for all tastes but for those who appreciate this genre with a moral twist, it is a rewarding experience. The action is graphic and unrelenting as the stakes get higher. As violent and startling as some of the scenes are-no punches pulled here, there is a noble theme that is never lost. What comes through in District 9 is its humanity amid the aliens and hardware, and the final shot cannot help but be affecting. Wow, an independent science fiction film with state of the art technical effects and a compelling, intimate story. Where do I sign up?",9,0,4,5 March 2010
Batman Begins," BATMAN BEGINS Jumpstarts the Franchise
","Batman Begins is a reinventing of Bob Kane's original comic book hero, and it is generally a successful transition into the 21st century with some nice wrinkles and updates. The comic book hero from D.C. Comics has captured the imagination of the public in print, television, and film. Director Christopher Nolan's vision cleverly takes threads of the original story and merges them with unique twists and turns.The wealthy Wayne family of Gotham City is well lauded, and young son, Bruce, lives an idyllic, pampered life with childhood friend Rachel. A chance accident lands him in a cave of bats which begins a cycle of trauma that will culminate in the murder of his parents in the city streets. A wayward, lost soul, Bruce (Christian Bale) grows into a young man who remains distant despite the support of family butler, Alfred (Michael Caine). Seeking meaning in his life, he travels the streets of the world to understand the criminal elements until a fateful meeting in Asia with a mentor, Ducard (Liam Neeson), who beckons Wayne to a temple/fortress in a remote mountain. There, he meets a group of avengers who have great fighting skills and unyielding, harsh justice. Bruce learns from Ducard to shed his inner fears of bats and harness the feelings of his parents' death. As Wayne masters his physical and mental prowess, his sense of humanity ultimately collides with the shadow group's ruthless sense of justice.Wayne returns to and assimilates into Gotham City as a 'millionaire playboy' who secretly assumes the symbol of a bat to fight crime as Batman. In a city of increasing corruption and crime enters crime lord Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) and his cohort, Dr. Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy) whose alter ego, Scarecrow, will figure in an ever complicated plot. With support from Rachel (Katie Holmes), who works for the District Attorney, and Detective Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman), Wayne also finds within his corporation an advanced weapons division overseen by Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) who helps to arm Batman with state of the art body armor and sophisticated devices. As Batman commences his crime fighting, Scarecrow and ultimately a figure from Wayne's past will threaten Gotham with ultimate doom. This film stakes a claim to its own vision and resists previous, formulaic blueprints like Spiderman for depicting super heroes. With the most recent Batman films reducing the franchise to an uninspired shadow of its former self, someone had sense enough to let visionary director Nolan (Momento, Insomnia) have a crack at it. He has a great knack for incorporating his nightmarish imagery and integrated flashbacks into a brooding, dark exploration of human paranoia, memories and fear. Nolan cleverly traumatizes young Wayne with bats which ironically will be his salvation. This is a different kind of narrative with more mood, psychological depth, and deliberate pacing. When Batman appears from above, it is an iconic vision of terror and swift justice, the perfect distillation of urban redemption in the guise of a bat facing down evil. Comic book aficionados will revel in a faithful rendering that stays true to the original's roots and at the same time pays homage to recent updates like the critically acclaimed, Frank Miller's The Dark Knight. Fans will also be amused at the new interpretations and somewhat poetic license taken on such established conventions as the bat cave, the bat signal, the coming to be of future Commissioner Gordon, and Alfred the butler. It is refreshing that the hero and villains are not really superhuman like Superman but rather ordinary people who are driven by a psychological bent. The only real letdown is that while it starts out on a promising path, it degenerates into a conventional, by-the-numbers action formula in the last fifteen minutes. The story, which admittedly takes its good time to unfold, starts to run out of steam and momentum about three quarters of the way through and drags a bit until the revved up end. One could almost forgive the obvious teaser at the end which is a deliberate setup for a future sequel. It's ironic that as much as the filmmakers tried to make Batman plausible and grounded in reality, there are credibility gaps especially towards the end. In one scene, Gordon attempts to operate the Bat vehicle, and it just doesn't ring true. A fight aboard an elevated train (and earlier fight scenes) is at best standard fare. Christian Bale (The Machinist) has been perceived as a rising talent whose persona is that of dark intensity; who better to portray the Dark Knight? He is surrounded by an exceptional supporting cast. Caine is effortlessly stoic. It is amusing in one scene to see both veteran pros like he and Freeman counsel Bale. Liam Neeson is good as a mentor but he is in danger of being typecast in these kinds of roles. Oldman is cast against type and quite effectively as a good cop. Ken Watanabe (The Last Samurai) as the leader of the temple is not given much to do unfortunately.The luscious musical score by committee is appropriately strong and heroic without leaning on a catchy title theme as previous Batman scores have popularized e.g. Nelson Riddle on TV and Danny Elfman in film. The art direction and set design are impressive in their own interpretation of Gotham City compared to the earlier Tim Burton films which set a new standard. By the climax, you root for the film to fulfill its promise but it doesn't quite succeed. Although successes like X Men and Spiderman are good examples of mainstream, pop hero entertainment, the makers of Batman Begins for the most part have raised the super hero film to an art film, and that's not a bad thing.",8,0,0,27 July 2005
Bridesmaids," A BRIDESMAIDS To Celebrate
","TV's Saturday Night Live has long been a proving ground for some of the top comedians who have often gone on to greater fame. Witness John Belushi (Animal House), Eddie Murphy (Beverly Hills Cop, Trading Places), Bill Murray (Ghostbusters, Stripes), Will Ferrell (Anchorman), and Tina Fey (30 Rock) among many. Certainly a few have failed in films like Deuce Bigelow, The Ladies Man, and MacGruber. Current female SNL player, Kristen Wiig, joins the ranks of the former with Bridesmaids, an occasionally gross, yet heartfelt tale of self worth and ultimately love. After numerous supporting roles in popular films like Adventureland and Whip It, she has made the big leap into stardom, and she co-wrote the screenplay too! Annie (Wiig) is an insecure, single woman working a miserable job at a jewelry store and whose love life consists of impersonal sexual romps with a narcissistic playboy (Jon Hamm). Her dreams of a bakery having failed recently, she has horrible roommates and a doting mother (Jill Clayburgh) nearby. When her best friend, Lillian (Maya Rudolph) announces her engagement and asks her to be her bridesmaid, Annie prepares the female bridal party for gowns, showers, and the reception. When Lillian's wealthy, 'perfect' friend, Helen (Rose Byrne), elbows her way for attention and begins to take over the wedding preparations, Annie becomes jealous and overdoes things in a display of one-upsmanship (or rather womanship). In a series of confrontational events, Annie sinks further into verbal ineptitude and embarrassment in front of her best friend. Along the way she gets pulled over by an Irish cop, Rhodes (Chris O'Dowd), who takes a fancy to her; what puzzles her is why any man would be nice to her? It all culminates at a pre-wedding reception where Annie unleashes her anger and frustration. Things get worse for her at work and her apartment, and as her world comes crashing down and she becomes an outsider to her best friend's wedding, Annie's fate takes a dramatic turn amid friendship and love.Audiences have been well aware of Wiig's physical and whimsical skills as a skit comedienne. What this film does is show an entirely different spectrum of her abilities as an actress and writer (with Annie Mumolo directed by Paul Feig). By playing a sympathetic character with flaws and yearnings and surrounding herself with a roster of talented actresses, Wiig has positioned herself as an every woman who has had life's ups and downs, but mostly downs and creating such pathos that the payoff at the end is more satisfying. The scenes between Wiig and O'Dowd, who make a terrific couple, are genuine and really hold the story on a firm emotional footing. As one of Lillian's friends, Melissa McCarthy (Mike & Molly) steals every scene she is in and provides the film with some of its funniest moments in support. Even Byrne shines as the manipulative, scheming friend while Ellie Kemper and Wendi McLendon-Covey round out the wedding party. As Annie's mom, Clayburgh performs a sweet, final career note; this was her last film. Jon Hamm is only in a few scenes but is quite effective as a chauvinist jerk.There are numerous funny moments. A toast to Lillian and her fiancé by Annie and Helen develops into dueling testimonials that become silly and outrageous. When Annie gets stopped by a policeman, she displays her talent for physical comedy in conducting a drunk test. A scene where she sits at her mom's home alone watching a video of Castaway's scene of Tom Hanks losing his 'best friend' Wilson is a hoot. On the plane when Annie mixes prescription medication and alcohol, she becomes obnoxiously and amusingly uninhibited, and there is a running gag with McCarthy who thinks her seat companion is really an air marshal. Bridesmaids a film that is honest and direct about its subject matter and its consenting adults, and it has moments that are crude such as the food poisoning scene at the wedding boutique and some sexual gymnastics between Wiig and Hamm.The film is a bit uneven in places but when it hits the right notes especially towards the end, when a major character like Annie undergoes a transformation, it feels genuine and at times heartfelt, and we are the beneficiaries of something more than a pedestrian comedy. When her relationship with Lillian is threatened, Annie reacts in exaggerated, desperate behavior. She even has trouble accepting true intimacy from a good man because she has never been treated so nice. It's really about Annie being able to connect in a meaningful way with another human being. In fact, Annie's plight and desperation shares its DNA with Bridget Jones's Diary.With its predominantly female cast, this Judd Apatow (40 Year Old Virgin, Knocked Up) co-produced film delivers the laughs with feeling. Don't think of this as just a 'chick flick' but rather an entertaining, contemporary comedy that contains just a bit more estrogen. And do stay for the closing credits if you want a bit of raunchy fun.",8,2,6,6 June 2011
Django Unchained," Revisionist History in DJANGO UNCHAINED
","L'infant terrible, Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds), has specialized integrating his encyclopedic knowledge of exploitive movies into reinvented, genre films stocked with top actors and highlighted by dialogue enriched scenes. The ultimate revenge tale in the guise of a slavery drama morphed into a western, Django Unchained is a highly entertaining adventure with a heavy dose of violence.It is the pre-Civil War South where cruel plantation owners treat slaves inhumanely, and guns rule the landscape. A former dentist, Dr Schultz (Christoph Waltz), is a bounty hunter and seeks his quarry by enlisting the aid of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx). It seems bounty hunting is a very lucrative profession, and it facilitates Django's freedom and a means to search for and rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), from a wealthy slave owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). As Schultz and Django devise a plan to win Hildy's freedom, Candie, who relies on the counsel of his slave-confident, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), begins to suspect a ruse and with time running out, it leads to an explosive, bloody end.Although his films tend to function and be appreciated for their parts rather than the whole, there are, of course, the Tarantino trademarks. He knows how to build a scene, and part of the fun is the delicious interplay among the key characters. As in most of his films, his characters are put in situations where there is an inevitability, a destiny if you will as the tension and looming threat of violence gets unbearable at times particularly in the climactic dinner scene. He also has a couple of scenes early on which are meant to fool the audience in which things appear one way but are really a clever misdirection.Foxx is quite the stud as the determined former slave, and DiCaprio is cast convincingly against type. Yet it is Waltz who shines here, and he makes the most of a role written for him.As he has done in all his previous films, Tarantino has resurrected former stars and character actors in numerous supporting roles. Part of the fun is trying to recognize a face under heavy makeup. Try identifying Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Robert Carradine, Bruce Dern, Russ Tamblyn, Don Stroud, Franco Nero (star of the original titled film), Don Johnson, Dennis Christopher, or James Remar.The film is heavily influenced by spaghetti westerns with the long stares and moody musical score. The action scenes are brutal and at times over the top; when has it not been so in a Tarantino film? One day perhaps, he should make a more intimate, gentle film to prove his versatility (like David Lynch demonstrated in The Straight Story).At 165 minutes, the film could use a bit leaner running time, but it is good fun if you aren't put off by the periodic, graphic violence. Tarantino may be a film geek with a nasty streak, but he definitely knows how to put together engaging, crowd pleasers, even if much of the material is cleverly recycled from older, obscure films. He has devised a crackerjack piece of entertainment, and while he says he wants to make a very limited amount of films in his career, if they continue to be as popular and well written as this and his previous work, we may have to wait a couple years or more for the next one. For his fans, it will be worth the wait.",9,2,6,10 March 2013
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Bloody good escapism that leaves you hungry yet satisfied!
","I am not a hard core fan of the Trilogy of The Lord of the Rings but as a movie buff, I can safely say that this installment, The Two Towers, is no less than the second in what appears to be a hat trick by Peter Jackson! It is destined for blockbuster business and a slew of Oscar nominations. It may even surpass the original in many ways.The story starts right into the next chapter without recounting or summarizing the previous feature-bravo for being gutsy enough to trust your audience, Mr Jackson. The film diverges into three parallel storylines following each set of heroes in their quest to merge various groups of people to fight the powerful evil forces.  Without losing the thrust of Frodo and his journey with the dreaded ring, we find several new characters being introduced (including a wonderful computer enhanced creature).Clocking in at 179 minutes, the film is superbly paced and yet methodical in its characterizations and various subplots.  The action is grand and mind boggling. It is almost breathtaking in its sweep and audacity.  A perfect blend of special effects, set design, and natural scenery. 
One can imagine Pater Jackson and his team expanding on the original source novel by enhancing the romantic aspects and the action set pieces, but as true entertainment, it was a shrewd and successful choice.For this type of film and story, it is as close to perfection as they come. The finale cannot come soon enough!",Null,0,0,18 December 2002
The Incredibles," The Incredibles is super for fans
","Pixar Studios has become the premiere animation studio and The Incredibles supports that ranking. With Dreamworks' claim to the mantle through its Shrek films, an interesting battle for best animation film shapes up for the 2004 Oscars. The Incredibles represents Pixar's first animation film to feature human (albeit superhuman) characters.The story starts with superhero Mr. Incredible who, like other superheroes, fights crime until some of the public sues them for super damages. So all the heroes go into a kind of witness protection plan and raise families. Years pass and when a fateful call goes to Mr. Incredible to be a superhero again, he jumps at the chance. But what seems like a great opportunity turns out to be an evil plan by someone from Mr. Incredible's past who wants to eliminate all superheroes until there is no one left to save humanity. What follows is a clever mix of comic book derring-do and a plot lifted from a dozen James Bond films. Even the musical score by Michael Giacchino oozes so much horn and percussion, it is hard to tell that John Barry himself did not repeat his famous scores of past Bond films.The whole family is comprised of super humans (whose powers emulate heroes from the D.C. and Marvel Comics canon.) Mr. Incredible is a super strong hero (like Superman or the Hulk), Elastigirl can stretch her body rubber band thin (like Mr. Fantastic of The Fantastic Four), daughter Violet can turn invisible and use force fields (like Invisible Girl Sue Storm), and son Dash can run very fast (like The Flash). There is also the baby who seems normal, but you just know something's going to happen by movie's end. The only thing missing is maybe a super dog or cat. Syndrome, the bad guy, gives a sort of John Lithgow villainy and even has the hair of TV's Mr. Heat Miser. Throughout the film, there is always the connectivity of family and responsibility. This is not about good versus evil and showing off great animation effects. What the writers do so successfully is to take the hero mythology and turn it on its ear. Fans of super heroes are going to be in heaven here. There are the requisite demonstrations of super powers and the threat of danger and death. The animation is so good and the plot line so full of threads that one wonders what Pixar could do by recreating other superheroes or reanimating classics of television past like Jonny Quest.Craig T. Nelson finds the right intonations to give his Mr. Incredible a sympathetic, yet heroic voice. Holly Hunter has such an attractive lisp of Southern womanhood that she is perfect to voice a strong female who leads the triple life of hero, wife, and mother. Samuel L. Jackson is amusing as Frozone, Mr. Incredible's best friend. Even writer/director Brad Bird (Iron Giant) voices Edna, the costume designer for superheroes, in a deliciously funny turn; imagine Truman Capote crossed with Linda Hunt!The film is almost too sophisticated for young children and yet perfect for adults who are kids at heart. Some of the action scenes, while exciting and intense, may prove a bit too dark for really sensitive youngsters. The film lags a bit in the middles stretches as the story gets more complex. There is also a cute animated short that precedes the film. All in all, although The Incredibles is not the funniest animated film of the year nor necessarily the best, it sure is pretty terrific!",Null,0,1,13 November 2004
Hero," Hero is visually stunning
","After sitting for two years, Hero makes its belated bow in the U.S. after some help from Miramax and Quentin Tarantino (who has been influenced by this genre of Asian Cinema.)  The spoken language is in Chinese Mandarin with English subtitles. Nominated for best foreign film (China) at last year's Oscars, it is a deceptively simple tale of love and sacrifice told with broad strokes and set against actual events.During the reign of the First Emperor of China, a mysterious figure (Jet Li) approaches the king to offer his support after his claim of vanquishing the king's three would-be assassins.  Herein lies the conceit of the film, namely whose version is the truth?  Some things are not what they seem.  The story plays like an epic detective story utilizing Akira Kurosawa's classic, Rashomon, in telling the same story through different versions and points of view, and these scenes are told with strikingly contrasted color schemes in cinematography by Christopher Doyle (kind of reminds one of the hues employed in South Pacific) and costume coordination by Emi Wada. It also has concurrent themes of rivalry and love between two of the principal assassins.Comparisons to Akira Kurosawa's grandeur of Kagemusha and Ran are obvious. In many ways, Hero is a distant cousin of these spectacles in terms of its scope, production values, acting, and themes.  The fight scenes are a dazzling display of the same action prominent in numerous Chinese period action films of the 1960's and 1970's which are only recently getting rediscovered. Tarantino was highly influenced as evident in his Kill Bill bookends.  Better known for his more intimate dramas, director Yimou Zhang (Raise the Red Lantern) knows how to get good performances from his talented veteran cast.  One wishes that Ziyi Zhang (Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon) had a stronger and more substantial role, but that is a small complaint.  The fight sequences are well conceived and choreographed although the Crouching Tiger style of super warriors who can literally fly and walk on water gets a bit repetitive after awhile.  Also, even though the emotions run high, one wonders how many scenes of flowing tears are enough.  As the character Nameless, Jet Li is perfectly cast as a kind of man with no name like the spaghetti westerns of Eastwood.  It is a role which plays to his strengths. One could easily imagine a young Toshiro Mifune excelling in this role. 
By making this visually spectacular film, Zhang has combined a strong degree of human drama with historical events.  In the end, one feels the familiarity of the Star Trek: Wrath of Khan story theme, the good of the many outweigh the few or the one'.  It could easily be said that the film carries a subtle statement about the current state affairs with mainland China and Taiwan.  It may not necessarily win any converts, but fans of this ambitious kind of moviemaking will appreciate the action and sweep of a technically proficient film.",Null,0,0,30 August 2004
The Hurt Locker," THE HURT LOCKER and the Human Essence of War
","Blessed with an insightful script by journalist Mark Boal, director Kathryn Bigelow (Point Break) has finally found superior material to apply her talents, and the result is a seminal war film set in Iraq. This is not the spectacle of war in broad strokes but rather an intimate point of view. As such, it provides a very personal, visceral experience.In the middle of the Iraq War, Sgt. J T Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) welcomes a replacement for a fallen comrade. The new soldier, Sgt. William James (Jeremy Renner), is a quirky soul whose specialty is disarming bombs. 38 days are left for Bravo Company as the group sets out to diffuse a bomb. While an automated robot might be appropriate, James insists on doing the job himself and finds a booby trap in the city streets. After a tense period and an unexpected surprise, he is successful but not before spooking Sanborn and the other soldiers nearby. His boldness and gambling has serious consequences for his comrades.James is a loose cannon, but does he have a death wish? He has the emotional and physical scars from war, and he lives and breathes bombs to the point of keeping bomb parts as souvenirs. He is addicted to the job, and war gives his life meaning. He is the perfect war junkie. It's a high stress existence and the only person a soldier can rely on is his fellow soldier. These men bond amid difficult life and death situations while there is barely a shot fired. This is most definitely not Audie Murphy's kind of war.The risks escalate when a car loaded with explosives is set afire and as James tries to disarm the device, the soldiers attract a lot of attention from the locals who may or may not be innocent observers. It becomes a precarious situation by the minute as James' expertise is tested to the limit. We witness the risks of guerilla warfare as threats come from around any street corner.As days melt down to hours, the tension becomes almost unbearable, and you can feel the anxiety and fear in these men. There is an arduous sequence as the group gets pinned down by deadly sniper fire amid an oppressive sun. Later, a heartbreaking scene has James attempting to defuse a bomb strapped to an innocent civilian pleading for his life. It's a desperate task as the seconds tick away. The emotions and the impossibility of the situation make for a compelling moment.James has a wife and son back home where he discovers some truths about himself. Finding civilian life difficult to adjust to, he realizes the one thing makes him feel alive, and that is a tour of duty.Some notable actors like Ralph Feinnes, Guy Pierce, and Evangeline Lilly appear in what are essentially throwaway cameos. Mackie is good as a soldier whose priorities in life change dramatically through his deployment, and Brian Geraghty registers as a young soldier who cannot wait to return safely to the states. But it is Renner who excels in the difficult role of a gifted, but troubled soldier.Bigelow has always been adept at films (Point Break, Blue Steel) with lead characters under extreme duress, and she milks each bomb sequence with measured, tightly edited cuts to agonizingly prolong and heighten the suspense. She is schooling the public with pure cinematic technique. We feel a bit detached from these men not because they are not well drawn but because the film tries to show events in a semi-documentary way especially in its generous use of hand-held cameras that give the feel of news footage.This is not a perfect film. It feels episodic at times, and perhaps that is the point: that war can be a series of moments of danger and uncertainty. Also, we never fully realize or understand what makes James tick. We know he is drawn to his job and is very good at what he does. But we never see into his psyche's attraction to this profession beyond the adrenaline rush.While the film may not accurately portray military tactics or protocal, it does capture the human emotions of impossibly difficult tasks amid a hostile environment. Credit the filmmakers for exploring a fascinating aspect of warfare. In terms of driving home the fear and effects of war on the common soldier, few films have ever been better.",8,2,8,5 March 2010
Wimbledon," Wimbledon Serves Love
","The sport of tennis serves (no pun intended) as a good background in Strangers on a Train and Pat and Mike. As the focal point of a full feature, it has never produced a solid film. Instead, there would be the occasional lightweight drama like Players (Dean Paul Martin and Ali McGraw) which fizzled back in 1980. Wimbledon, while a marked improvement over the former, does nothing to change the status quo. Primarily a star vehicle for Kirsten Dunst (Spiderman, Bring It On) and rising star Paul Bettany (Master and Commander, A Beautiful Mind), the storyline is the stereotypic budding romance between Dunst who is the up and coming tennis star, and Bettany, the aging midline star who is trying for one last shot at being champion at Wimbledon. Their romance blossoms much to the consternation of Dunst's father (Sam Neill) who fears distractions for his daughter. There are a few subplots involving Bettany's quarreling parents, his playing partner, and his opportunistic agent (Jon Favreau). It's not too hard to figure who might win/lose or where the romance will lead. Stars Dunst and Bettany are likable and have a nice chemistry but not much script to work with. There are a few nice lines and situations piecemealed throughout, but the plot is paper thin and the dialogue is unimaginative. This was from the people who brought us Notting Hill and Four Weddings and a Funeral? Ah, look at the credits more closely and Richard Curtis is missing; not even a Hugh Grant cameo is in sight. Sam Neill, Bernard Hill, and Eleanor Bron (Remember her from the original Bedazzled?) are wasted in minor roles. The tennis scenes are somewhat fun with the stars putting their all in the physical matches, but the tennis balls are almost too perfect as the special effects become too obvious.Bettany is destined for more substantial roles and Dunst won't be hurt by this lightweight comedy/drama. One could only imagine what they could have done with a more lively script and complex characters. Sure it's nice to look at and the stars are a cute couple, but this was a squandered opportunity.",Null,47,74,13 September 2004
Lincoln," LINCOLN Comes Alive
","The subject of many films over the decades, Abraham Lincoln has been portrayed to great effect by such top actors as Raymond Massey, Henry Fonda, and on TV by Hal Holbrook. Steven Spielberg has assembled a great cast headed by Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, a chronicle of the last weeks of his presidency and his final important accomplishment before he was assassinated. As a slice of history, it is a fascinating insight into the political challenges that went into the 13th Amendment. As a portrayal of a historic figure, it could not be any better.In January, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln (Lewis) has been just re-elected and must contend with major issues particularly the ongoing toll of the Civil War. Amid the inequality of the 'colored' soldiers and a growing personal conviction that was marked by his landmark Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Lincoln is passionate about getting the 13th Amendment (which would unequivocally free all slaves) passed in Congress. At odds with his headstrong wife, Mary Todd (Sally Field), and surrounded by a doubting cabinet and strange bedfellows, Lincoln's challenge is to secure enough votes in Congress amid powerful opposition. With the potential of a Confederate signal for an end to the war, Lincoln must weigh the political fallout of ending a costly conflict and achieving lasting freedom for all Americans.Lincoln is not intended as an all encompassing biography but rather a microscope into the President's last great act of his administration, and it illustrates his sheer will and unshakable faith. It demonstrates his disarming sense of humor and philosophy, and he is depicted as an imperfect human whose relationships are depicted as often dysfunctional whether it is with his paranoid wife Mary Todd over the loss of deceased son or his rebellious older son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).Unwilling to compromise on his beliefs, Lincoln realizes that his legacy will be tied to this moment forever. It is revealing how the political challenges in Congress are dealt with in bold strokes or subtle, delicate wording. His battles with Congress have direct parallels with the current political climate.Lincoln had the foresight to look ahead and anticipate his legacy and how the world will look on to this moment in history including the proposed Reconstruction of the South once hostilities ceased. The behind the scenes cajoling and arm twisting make for an interesting insight into the political process. As the momentous day for the important vote arrives, each congressman places his vote in a manner not unlike the founding fathers of 1776.Daniel Day-Lewis has become the Paul Muni of our generation. By being selective with his roles, he has played larger than life period figures that have transcended their respective films. He inhabits this role perfectly, and the makeup work and vocal inflections are outstanding. When the war winds down and has taken an emotional toll on Lincoln, you see the President's line worn face.Sally Field is the perfect foil as Mary Todd, his opinionated wife. Tommy Lee Jones is a standout in an impressive cast of well known actors (including Holbrook as an influential citizen). His Thaddeus Stevens, whose support was instrumental in Congress, is an intimidating figure with an imposing demeanor. He gets some of the best lines. James Spader makes a fine, slimy operative for Seward, who is played with stern conviction by David Strathairn. Spielberg consistently gives a slave's point of view to put things in perspective. The war and the amendment are seen through the eyes of former slaves particularly Gloria Reuben's servant to Mrs. Lincoln.The film is magnificently shot by Janusz Kaminski in a manner that emulates the iconic pictures of the period. You feel at times that you are witness to actual, historic events. We don't actually see much of the Civil War battles but rather the aftermath in the bodies and limbs that are testimonials to the horror of warfare. Indeed, such themes recur in Spielberg films depicting World War I (War Horse) and World War II (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Empire of the Sun).There is a certain reverence and awe when you watch this film because the details are recreated vividly. Tony Kushner's screenplay is the blueprint that enables Spielberg to add to a body of work that contains some of the best documentations of American history (Amistad). There will be future film versions on the life of this remarkable historic figure, but it is difficult to imagine a better impersonation, period.",10,0,2,10 March 2013
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby is rich in emotion
","Million Dollar Baby is rich in emotion Clint Eastwood's latest directorial effort, Million Dollar Baby, is a drama that starts in the boxing ring and ends in the heart. It is a poignant tale about hope, failure, and old ghosts. It is also the best film Eastwood has ever made.Frankie Dunn is an aging owner of a boxing gym who trains a boxer to the brink of a title fight only to miss a timely opportunity. When an aspiring female boxer, Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank), approaches him for training, he rebuffs her as just a girl boxer and too old at 31 years. Maggie is a waitress whose desire to fight is her ultimate dream as she attempts to make something of her life that has been a rural, backwoods existence. Dunn's best friend, Eddie Dupris (Morgan Freeman), takes a liking to the boxer's heart and work ethic, and eventually the two win Frankie over. Frankie's rules are to never question him in training and to always protect oneself in the ring. A slow but gradual learning curve ensues as Maggie becomes a polished boxer who displays a stunning record of wins, mostly by knockouts. Meanwhile, Frankie takes a liking to his protégé and begins to become attached to her. Their relationship is a contrast to his personal demons. His soul struggles with doubt and guilt as he attends church with constant regularity and the letters he sends to his estranged daughter are always returned unopened.Maggie becomes the focal point of Frankie's world as she attracts boxing matches from top competition which leads to a possible championship in Las Vegas. It is at this point that the story takes a path that is unexpected and startling. It is here that two lives are changed forever and boxing seems trivial in light of subsequent events. And it is here that hard choices and decisions are made.Based on a group of stories by the late F. X. Toole, Paul Haggis's screenplay is a beauty, filled with memorable dialogue and a story arc that takes its audience on a journey of humanity. The leading cast makes the most of the material. The scenes between Eastwood and Freeman ring true and validate two characters that go way back. Most actors pale in comparison to these two consummate pros at the height of their powers. Morgan Freeman, whose character narrates the story much as he did in Shawshank Redemption, lends strong support. Hilary Swank, who won an Oscar in Boys Don't Cry, is outstanding in a role which required rigorous training while etching a vivid character whose life takes a dramatic shift. Eastwood has always been a solid director and producer. While his early films took advantage of his tough guy image and did not require much thespian range, he filled those roles quite successfully. In recent years, he has grown as director and as a performer by allowing himself some choice dramatic projects (Unforgiven and Bridges of Madison County). But this is without a doubt his greatest piece of acting. He has allowed himself to let go and get to his inner self, and the results are touching and impressive.As a director, Eastwood has proved with films like Unforgiven and Mystic River that he has a strong, disciplined vision. His work here is most assured and it is very evident that he has matched if not surpassed his previous highs. He is patient and methodical in how he adds layers upon layers of dialogue and scenes to develop his characters into full blooded people. When Maggie approaches Frankie at first, he has no interest in training her, but you know these two will somehow end up working together. Eastwood does not go for easy clichés as she tries to win him over with help from Eddie. Even when he uses tried and true formulas, he does them well. And when Frankie decides to give her a chance, the journey is earned believably. Eastwood's direction is economic and lean. In fact, the pacing is deliberate and there is really no extraneous material (as in earlier good efforts like The Outlaw Josie Wales) to cut or trim. It may be the best job of directing this past year.Technical categories are strong particularly in cinematography with the darkly lit scenes that add so much to the mood and texture of the moment, and the editing which lends much urgency to the fights and offers unique transitions in the dramatic scenes. (It is interesting that as Maggie ascends to bigger fight venues, the crowds are more affluent and better dressed by the costume department.) Eastwood does a pretty good job of composing some eloquent music. What a multitalented threat he is becoming! There is not much to quibble with this film. Sure, Maggie's white trash family is a bit too stereotypical and one dimensional. We don't get to the bottom of Frankie's family background as much as we'd like. Some of the fights are bloody and violent but not particularly gratuitous or self serving as in Raging Bull.What ostensibly starts out as a pretty darn good boxing story becomes transformed into a powerful human drama that eschews even its fighting pedigree. Boxing is just a pretext for a much larger canvas. There is the drama of individual struggle and achievement, yet the story aims much higher and raises the ante in tone and direction in ways the audience can't quite anticipate. Eastwood challenges himself and the audience with a story that is not easy and pat. It is a movie that dares to go to areas that are controversial and gut wrenching. While audiences may have a tough time sitting through Million Dollar Baby a second or third time, they sure as hell will be grateful they did just once.**** out of ****",Null,1,2,20 January 2005
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," America on Trial in GOOD NIGHT, AND GOOD LUCK
","Actor/Director George Clooney pays tribute to truth and decency amid distrust and uncertainty in the Communist witchhunts with his recreation of its greatest hero, the newsman of newsmen, Edward R. Murrow, in Good Night, and Good Luck.In the early 1950's, the Communist scare and the subsequent subversion of citizens' rights was at its apex with blacklists and rampant accusations resulting in ruined lives and careers. Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) was the grand master of the news airwaves in the infantile medium of television. With his show's director, Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and his production team, he picks one obscure news item regarding an Air Force serviceman who is dismissed due to unspecified charges. Murrow and CBS essentially take on the US Air Force amid this climate of suspicion and presumed guilt. Later, Murrow's team takes on Senator Joseph McCarthy by making critical comments of the senator's own words and contradictions. McCarthy retaliates with accusations of Murrow's supposed association with un-American groups just as the parent network, CBS, reels under sponsorship pressure and the unpredictable whims of network president William Paley (Frank Langella). As Murrow and his own staff come under tense scrutiny by McCarthy and even CBS, public reaction and the response of the print media come to the forefront.Nothing can compare to the words that were written and spoken with such conviction and honesty as those uttered by Murrow. The title of the movie is a direct quote that Murrow employed to sign off each week at the close of his interview shows. The filmmakers (including director Clooney and writers Clooney and Grant Heslov) were wise to let the text stand on its own. They also benefit from good performances from a cast headed by Strathairn (L.A. Confidential, A League of Their Own), a journeyman actor who has finally found a core role to call his own, and he makes the most of it. He gets the mannerisms and cadence down quite convincingly, and while Strathairn may not look exactly like Murrow, he has the persona nailed. Frank Langella (Dave) is excellent as the mercurial Paley whose support of Murrow was tenuous at best. Ray Wise (Twin Peaks) registers in what could have been a more defined role as a doomed newsman whose guilt by association triggers some life changing events. Patricia Clarkson (The Station Agent) and Robert Downey Jr. (Chaplin) as secretly married staffers, Joe and Shirley, round out the cast. Ironically, perhaps the best performance can be attributed to McCarthy himself as newsreels offer a fascinating, perverse glance at the infamous politician whose flamboyance and dogged theatrics doomed the careers of many government officials and film or television actors. The duel between Murrow and McCarthy seems like two heavyweights going at it verbally in the public arena.The cinematography by Robert Elswit (Magnolia) is crisp and starkly lit in black and white to evoke the past. The production design and costumes are consistent with the period. Just the sight of newsmen typing on old style typewriters or production assistants carrying around film reels instead of videotape or discs is amusing. The editing by Stephen Mirrione (Traffic, 21 Grams) is tight and well paced. At times the studio broadcasts of a female blues singer bridges various sequences in theme and mood. The broadcast of a live network news program is staged with realism and with the frenzy and excitement that only live television could bring. One wonders what TV veterans like Sidney Lumet or Robert Altman could have brought to the table.Murrow's show was kind of a precursor to the current granddaddy of all prime time news shows, 60 Minutes. It was interesting to see that his was not a perfect career having to mix fluffy showbiz interviews with such personalities as Liberace on his Person-to-Person show with legitimate news reports. At 93 minutes, the film surprisingly seems a bit short. You almost feel like this is a big budget episode of the famous You Are There reenactment shows. The story ends almost abruptly as it begins being bookended by a formal event honoring Murrow in 1958.A couple of things don't quite work in the film. The characters of Joe and Shirley must come to terms with the network's policy forbidding marriage among its coworkers, but this subplot doesn't significantly serve to move the story forward. Clooney shows a workman-like approach to directing the film but it just doesn't grab you as emotionally as you would like. You sit there entranced by the history but are never fully given to the pathos of its characters. Instead, the film becomes almost a quasi-documentary bereft of much feeling.As previous films have dealt with the Red Scare and blacklists, this film compares favorably with The Front and the great television movie Fear on Trial. Although the Soviet Union was a major threat to the United States during the Cold War, the accusatory enemy from within was perhaps as great a menace. The implications and parallels to today's political climate and the role television has in shaping perception are clearly the point Clooney and gang are trying to make. Murrow's formal speech, which begins and ends the film's story, is itself a prophetic and sobering commentary and indictment of the possibilities of television and foreshadows the future with amazing prescience. It shows that one man made a difference. Such is the testament to a heroic reporter whose integrity this film manages to capture, albeit in a brief history lesson.",8,223,265,12 October 2005
The Dark Knight," The Masterpiece That Is THE DARK KNIGHT
","When Batman Begins (2005) reenergized the franchise with its dark, brooding vision and Zen beginnings, it looked like the followup could be primed for even better results. The higher expectations have not only been met, but are exceeded in The Dark Knight. Featuring a diabolical performance by the late Heath Ledger, this is a terrific film that takes the franchise to darker places, and it is a milestone in comic adaptations and certain to alter the course of such films in the future.An elaborate bank heist is engineered by the ruthless Joker who is stealing from and toying with the mobsters of Gotham City. Batman (Christian Bale), the caped crusader, watches over the city aiding police Lt. James Gordon (Gary Oldman). Although Batman is an outcast in society, his true identity is billionaire Bruce Wayne, Gotham's revered benefactor. A new 'face' in the form of District Attorney Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), has arrived to clean up crime. Dent is a supremely confident, dynamic 'white knight' who means business, and he is dating Wayne's former love, Rachel Dawes (Maggie Gyllenhaal). As Wayne Enterprise's Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman) upgrades his armor and weaponry, Batman must confront the Joker, who consolidates his power and rule over Gotham's mobs and begins to target city officials including Dent for assassination. When Dent sets himself as bait for The Joker, Batman must chase down and save the district attorney and Rachel from certain death. Meanwhile, a new villain emerges from an unlikely source. Racing against time, Batman is forced into a life and death choice, and he must decide if he should make a sacrifice that will forever change the course of Gotham's heroic avenger.Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Momento) in arguably his most accomplished work, this mature, psychological movie takes its themes seriously and weaves subplots upon subplots. For instance, how does a group of people respond when its morality and survival instincts are tested to the limit? You may be surprised and thrilled by the answers. The plot twists are so numerous, you wonder, 'am I really watching an action picture?' By the end, the franchise is launched into a new, uncertain direction. Bravo to the filmmakers for not playing it safe.Whenever Ledger is on screen, he is simply terrific. There is not one false note or boring moment as he lights up the screen. With his body language, every inflection and facial expression all working in concert to create a horrifying persona, he is so convincing, you cannot imagine that it is Heath Ledger. He is complemented, as are the other leads, with a well written script full of memorable lines. This Joker is a far cry from previous incarnations (Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson) of the clown prince of crime. When Wayne tries to fathom The Joker's motivations, Alfred counsels him and states, 'Some men want to watch the world burn.' This Joker is grounded in real evil and is thus all the more menacing. We get bits and pieces of Joker's sordid, traumatic past, which are totally credible in explaining his origins. Essentially an urban terrorist, he threatens the innocent and causes them to live in fear, and he kills with no remorse. There is no logic to his acts, and yet he is a brilliant, clever strategist. Batman follows his own set of rules, but must he sink to Joker's level in order to combat him? If The Joker is like the devil, then Batman is almost a Christ-like figure, one with self doubt and who is willing to protect the innocent even if it means taking on or absorbing the sins and pain of the world around him. Christian Bale continues to impress by portraying dual characters (Bruce Wayne/Batman) effectively and playing off the likes of Freeman and Caine, who make the most of their supporting roles. Eckhart is convincing as Dent, a role much more developed and utilized than in Batman Forever. Gyllenhaal (replacing Katie Holmes) does quite well as Wayne's former flame. Oldman is very good as Gordon which is quite the change of pace from having previously played evil villains (JFK). In fact, Oldman, Freeman, and Caine form the moral compass of the film.With a talented cast bringing well rounded characters to the screen, Nolan keeps things grounded and never loses track of his story. A Gotham car chase and Hong Kong escape are breathtaking sequences yet wholly believable. You don't think of anything as computer generated or overdone, which is remarkable in this age of special effects. Are you listening Michael Bay (Armageddon, Con Air)? There are several well composed shots that are iconic and haunting. The hardware is eye-catchy including the Batmobile and a scooter like none you've ever seen. Pacing is methodical but it seems a bit choppy and jumpy by cramming in so much narrative material into a 2.5 hour running time. The camera-work is at times quite fluid and dazzling by enhancing the mood or (in The Joker's case) madness.There are a couple of moments that are a bit misleading or confusing such as an assassination attempt that may have claimed a key character's life. And the villain's fate is sort of, how shall I put this, left hanging? But these are tiny quibbles in a film vastly richer than any comic book adaptation (Spiderman 2 and Iron Man are in this elite company) to date. Rated PG-13, this is essentially an R rated film in spirit and not for younger children. It is creepy and sustains an overall dark, violent mood throughout. Go see The Dark Knight for a multi-layered story that challenges and surprises. Go see the wonderful acting and writing led by maestro Nolan. But most of all go see a burst of genius that was Ledger's brilliant, last hurrah.",9,1,4,25 July 2008
Pride & Prejudice," Literary Classic Shines in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE
","Author Jane Austen has been a popular source of material for recent films and television miniseries. Her free spirited, individual women who search for happiness amid ignorance and old fashioned conduct are refreshing even by today's standards. What's pleasantly surprising is that Austen's stories about manners, loyalty, honor, love, and betrayal have a universal appeal and a timeless quality amid a vivid period setting. A good example is Pride and Prejudice, which features thoughtful direction, a strong cast, and an impressive turn by its star, Keira Knightley.In 18th century England, the Bennet family consists of a mother, (Brenda Blethyn), father (Donald Sutherland), and their many daughters including eldest Jane (Rosamund Pike) and the most independent-minded, Elizabeth (Keira Knightley). Desperate to marry her daughters to wealthy bachelors, mom will manipulate an event like the upcoming ball to play matchmaker. Enter the mysterious Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen) and his friend, Mr. Bingley, who are well-to-do and seeking a female date for the latter. Jane and Bingley seem to hit it off and another ball ensues at the Bingley estate. Meanwhile, the seemingly indifferent Darcy takes note of the free spirited Elizabeth. Gossip and rumors abound. When a soldier, Mr. Wickham, appears to woo Elizabeth and relays a tale of betrayal at the hands of Darcy, Elizabeth begins to despise Darcy. There later appears a cousin, Mr. Collins, who is heir to the Bennet fortunes and is searching for a bride to be. The problem is that Collins is hopelessly unappealing especially to the object of his affection, Elizabeth, much to the annoyance of Mrs. Bennet. Elizabeth finds herself still seemingly attracted again to Mr. Darcy when their paths cross by accident. Add to the complications the intentions of wealthy Lady Catherine de Bourg (Judi Dench), who has designs on Darcy for her younger girl, and you have a dramatic interweaving of a complex study of romance in which lovers fall from grace and reconnect.Numerous versions of Austen's novel have been filmed including the Laurence Olivier version from 1940 and a British television series with Colin Firth (ironically cast as a similarly named and etched character, Mark Darcy, from Bridget Jones's Diary). TV veterans, director Joe Wright and screenwriter Deborah Moggach, do an impressive job of adapting the novel with good clarity of drama and moments of humor. It doesn't feel like a book but rather an organic, filmic event, no small feat. This is not a 'dumbed' down version but a contemporary translation done with the right balance of reverence to the source material while making it accessible to modern day audiences.Elizabeth is the kind of heroine who can think for herself at a time when women were not accorded many freedoms. She is cool as a proverbial cucumber as she makes a first impression on Darcy, and you feel an interest in how these two souls will come together despite some formidable obstacles along the way. It's a delightful premise, and part of the fun is how this storyline and several other threads will develop. It is refreshing in any film to see how major characters will challenge an audience by evolving over the course of the story instead of remaining static.Keira Knightley (Pirates of the Caribbean) at 20 is displaying the beginnings of a long, versatile career as a dependable actress who can tackle such prestigious material as this. In fact, her performance is not unlike the impressive turn of young Kate Winslet in Sense and Sensibility. MacFadyen is effective as Darcy, an aloof, cold fish when we first meet him. Blethyn (Secrets and Lies) is always good, and here she romps as the scheming mother. Sutherland, as the oblivious father, seems to fit period pieces quite well (Start the Revolution Without Me). Dench is always in command whenever she is on screen although it is a minor role. Rosamund Pike (Die Another Day) shows she can do more than action films.Sure, there are minor plot holes and some inconsistencies in the characters, but the main themes work. The dialogue is proper, old English, and it takes a little time to get up to speed in deciphering the accents. The pace drags slightly toward the end, but it finishes with a nice flourish of resolution and optimism. Its dreamy ending will set hearts swooning and minds wandering to an elegant, romantic era.The film has a natural, vivid sense of time and place. People bow and curtsey displaying all the proper mannerisms of the time. The cinematography is beautiful amid the English countryside and mansions. The extras are a realistic mixture of handsome faces and plain ones. Likewise, the interiors of the homes look worn and lived in. The balls are realistically choreographed in a manner reminiscent of TV's Hill Street Blues where people come and go out of frame and others move throughout a fluid camera shot. Transitions that show a passage of time are cleverly done.Pride and Prejudice is a worthy companion to 1995's Sense and Sensibility. Don't expect a boring film but rather a well paced drama with dashes of humor and heartfelt relationships. It not only proves that older, literary material can be brought to life cinematically without being stuffy, but that Knightley has emerged as a force to be reckoned with.",8,2,4,15 November 2005
Avatar," AVATAR and Cameron's Magnificent Obsession
","You would think that the man who redefined science fiction and action films over the past quarter century (Terminator, True Lies) and culminated with the best hat trick in movie history with Titanic garnering superlative reviews, earning the all-time box office, and winning a record 11 Oscars, would be satisfied and perhaps go on cruise control with a smaller film. But no, Cameron aims higher with a thrilling adventure that combines game changing special effects that have to be seen on the big screen in 3-D. In the not too distant future, Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a physically challenged soldier, volunteers for an unusual mission on a far away planet, Pandora, a beautiful yet dangerous world where the blue skinned Na'vi are a primitive, enlightened race who are at one with nature and its balance of life as epitomized by the Tree of Souls, a kind of fiber optic tree that has a consciousness. Utilizing a unique technology that enables Sully to become sentient in a genetically engineered substitute Na'vi body or avatar, he is deposited on Pandora to assimilate himself into their culture. Led by a stern, no-nonsense scientist Dr. Grace Augustine (Sigourney Weaver), Jake learns the ways of the Na'vi people especially through Neytiri (Zoe Saldana), a proud warrior (much like the heroine in Heavy Metal) whose father is the tribal leader. You just know that Jake and Neytiri are going to become closer in their relationship. Sully's commanding officer, Col. Miles Quaritch (Stephen Lang), expects him to gather intelligence on the Na'vi defense and capabilities in an effort to secure the valuable minerals beneath the Na'vi settlement. It seems that a mining company wants the minerals at any cost. As Sully bonds with these people and realizes that what the military plans to do, he has a change of heart and rallies all the villages to band together for a last stand and a simple battle between good and evil ensues with the Na'vi hopelessly outgunned and overly matched. The story is simple with political overtones about preserving a green planet and the clash between science and the military. This military is an extension of the bad asses in Cameron's Aliens. There are obvious parallels to the Iraq War with its natural oil resource. You can see elements of The Matrix with its out of body experience, and Star Wars: Return of the Jedi with its David versus Goliath setup. Any fan of old Tarzan films knows how nature is harnessed by the hero. You get the feeling that this planet's life force is a collective much as the trees in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and that something extraordinary might happen. The avatar plot device bares loose similarities to the 1960's TV show Outer Limits episode Chameleon. While Jake has damaged legs, he is able to revel in his new body and experiences what amounts to a rebirth. His initiation into Na'vi life is not dissimilar to the initiation rites in Dances with Wolves. Apparently Cameron has been gestating this idea for many years, waiting for movie technology to catch up to his complicated visuals. It was worth the wait. He has always been at the forefront of state of the art effects (The Abyss, Terminator 2) so it comes as no surprise that he has single handedly elevated the creative possibilities of 3-D presentation to the mainstream. Cameron does not resort to using 3-D as a gimmick by simply throwing objects at the screen but rather organically and even shots of the planet's jungles are fully realized settings with plant life and insects that jump out of the screen. The motion capture compliments and reflects real acting. What is remarkable is that this film is simultaneously demonstrating multiple visual effects in a seamlessly integrated presentation courtesy of Cameron's fertile imagination.Production values don't get any better. James Horner composes an energetic yet tender score that evokes his own Titanic and Glory. Although the second half settles into a more conventional war film, that's a minor complaint. There is a reference to Jake's late brother (a subplot that does not add much to the story) who was originally slated for the mission. Worthington and Saldana (Star Trek), in expressive motion capture, do a very solid job of emoting real feelings and making their love a tangible, believable union. Lang has an intimidating presence as the military commander and it's nice to see his career resurgence (Public Enemies). Weaver lends strong support as the wise, impassioned scientist who will defend the Na'vis even with her life. Make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking film in terms of technical achievement and theatrical presentation. It needs to be experienced in 3-D to get the complete experience. Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this landmark film.",10,3,5,5 March 2010
The Artist," The ARTIST and the Golden Age of Tinseltown
","The Artist is a little gem of a silent film that was shot in black and white. This clever throwback to old Hollywood was the work of a French production team with American support and headed by director Michel Hazanavicius. Not since Mel Brooks had the clout and audacity to make his Silent Movie in 1976 had a silent film been shot on a grand scale. Brooks had the advantage of blockbuster name recognition from his previous films and enlisting A list stars to do his film in color no less. The Artist has no superstars, and instead the film relies on telling a compassionate story that is surprisingly accessible to modern audiences.In 1927 Hollywood, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a matinée idol whose films are popular with the masses. At one Hollywood premier, he shows off his loyal dog (Uggie), and at the red carpet, he bumps into a fan, Peppy Miller (Bérénice Bejo), who has dreams of making it in movies. George's home life is not so happy as his eccentric wife (Penelope Ann Miller) disapproves of his carefree antics. Meanwhile, Peppy auditions for and wins a bit part in a chorus line and by chance meets Valentin again who hires her for his film despite the grumblings of the studio boss (a wonderful John Goodman). During a dance club scene, the two have instant chemistry and a romance is blossoming even as Valentin has doubts and feeling guilty as a married man. When the studio begins to embrace the sound era, he refuses to change with the times and finds sinking box office grosses and waning popularity while Peppy is a fast rising star. When the stock market crashes, Valentin is ruined financially and, his career in a heap, all hope is seemingly lost until a shining beacon comes to his aid with a novel plan.This is a silent film that caught everyone by surprise with its deceptively simple plot of romance, drama, comedy, and pathos. If that sounds like a Charlie Chaplin film, the kind of film they don't make anymore, it's because they haven't for over eighty years! People who respond to this film owe it to themselves to rediscover the classic silent films like Chaplin's City Lights and The General by Buster Keaton. The Artist is an ideal introduction to these and other masterworks.The film borrows liberally from past cinema, and its main plot is right out of A Star Is Born. When Valentin is seated at the dinner table with his judgmental wife, it begs comparisons to the famous transitions at the dinner table in Citizen Kane. The scenes where the studio is switching to sound pictures is reminiscent of the same dilemma in Singin in the Rain. The dog, who steals the film, is terrific as comic relief and figures in a scene where he attempts to rescue his master from a burning building-Rin Tin Tin anyone? Although the musical score by Ludovic Bource is quite good particularly in the playful main theme,it uses several minutes of a love theme from Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo for a climactic sequence. It works just fine, but purists who recognize Bernard Herrmann's haunting score may find it a tad annoying. There are also a couple brief instances when actual sound is employed to great effect.There are memorable moments including a loyal chauffeur (James Cromwell) who refuses to leave Valentin during his decline. There is a sentimental scene where Valentin has sold all his belongings and stands wistfully at a pawn shop, his refection superimposed with a tuxedo on display. And this may be one of the only times you see someone flip the bird in a silent film! Sure, some of the scenes are filled with old fashioned movie clichés, but what is noticeable throughout the film is an energy and enthusiasm that becomes infectious even after the novelty of watching a soundless film wears off. And consider this-an engaging silent film with no nudity or violence that is riding a wave of sentiment and love all the way to the Oscars.",9,5,9,24 February 2012
Up," UP Carries You Away
","Pixar has found a home with Disney and, with apologies to Dreamworks and other animation studios, no one has come close in recent years to their fresh, inventive, and importantly, timeless spirit in computer animation. In UP, a tale of loneliness and friendship is told in a simple, heartfelt way. This is one of the best films of the year and puts live action films to shame.Carl begins as an adventure-loving boy whose childhood friendship with a girl, Ellie, grows into a marriage as adults and a dream to visit their ideal destination, Paradise Falls in South America. Later widowed, Carl becomes a crusty, elderly man who longs for escape. In time, his neighborhood is transformed into an urban development, and one fateful day with the threat of being committed to a retirement community, he takes his house on a bold, unlikely trip by balloons through the skies to South America. Unfortunately, he discovers an accidental passenger in the form of a Boy Scout named Russell who is looking to get his final merit badge by helping a senior citizen. Carl must make a momentous decision that changes his life and affects Russell. Their joint flight arrives somewhere in the vicinity of Paradise Falls. Along the way they encounter an unusual, giant bird dubbed Kevin and a dog named Dug whose thoughts are vocalized through his special electronic collar. This motley group encounters a mysterious, dangerous presence that threatens them and jeopardizes Carl's journey to his final destination.Pete Docter (Wall-E, Toy Story) and Bob Peterson (Finding Nemo) bring their story and screenplay talents to the fore as co-directors. It's really a story about unfulfilled, broken dreams and things left undone, and the spirit and drive to recapture those feelings. The film begins with a subplot involving the friendship and growing romance of a young Carl and Ellie who share a passion for life and adventure. The imaginative vignettes tell a complete love story in an opening montage that ends as our film is only beginning-wow! What makes this film head and shoulders above most animations is its poignant confrontation of life's ups and downs. It's about life and death told in terms that are not disingenuous. In the grand tradition of Disney classics as Bambi and Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, movies about finding a safe place from danger are at the core of children's animation, and this film plays on that tradition. The novelty here is that the lead character is elderly. There is a sense of The Wizard of Oz in its otherworldly journey of discovery and camaraderie, and even the climax smacks of Saturday morning cliffhangers. A nice change of pace is the lack of contemporary, inside jokes or puns based on pop culture that are staples of such Dreamworks hits as the Shrek films. The situations here are organically amusing from natural conflicts and plot.Carl (voiced to perfection by Edward Asner) is a mean, bitter soul who rediscovers his innocence and humanity through Russell, who in turn discovers the safety of a nuclear family with Carl and some unlikely companions. Kevin is cute, emanating amusing sound effects and body movements without uttering a single line of dialogue. Dug is a riot as the misfit dog whose heart of gold is matched by his incessant habit of having his 'talking' interrupted at any moment by a sudden spasm of posturing and shouting, 'point' or 'squirrel'! It's a hoot. Christopher Plummer is effectively sinister as a blast from the past. The only criticism of the movie is minor at the end when we are not quite sure about Russell's parents and how much they are part of his life. John Ratzenberger's (Cheers) streak of doing a voice in every major Pixar release is intact.The computer animation is so good, that anything not human looks like a picturesque postcard. When Carl's balloons sprout above his house, we admire their stunning, vibrant colors. Interesting uses of cinematography are employed as if this were a live action feature. The final image is ironic as it is iconic, a fitting end to a fairy tale.This one ranks highly alongside Pixar favorites like Finding Nemo and Wall-E. Quite possibly, adults may find as much (if not more) to enjoy in this story. It's amazing that a modest story featuring a kid and old man told with conviction and skill is one of the best films of 2009.",9,1,2,30 August 2009
Les Misérables," The Triumph of the Commoner in LES MISERABLES
","There are musicals, and then there are musicals. This adaptation of the smash Broadway show, itself sourced from Victor Hugo's classic novel of the post French Revolution and the suffering plight of the populace has been transformed into an impressive film which will appeal to those open to its free flowing style of song and music. Think of this type of musical as operatic narrative with hardly a spoken line of actual dialogue. For the uninitiated and fans of traditional movie musicals, this may take some getting used to. If one can embrace the format, it is a well made, emotionally moving tale of love and hope.Spanning the years 1815-1832, in Paris, France, the years following the French Revolution have left the country divided with its common citizens in poverty and hard labor. A prisoner, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), is paroled under the watchful eye of policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe). Stigmatized by his record, Valjean flees his past and makes a new life for himself as an upstanding citizen until a chance encounter exposes his identity to Javert, and the hunt is on. Meanwhile, in a related incident, a factory worker, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), has been unjustly fired and must struggle to survive and care for her young daughter, Cosette. As Fantine must resort to desperate measures and all hope begins to fade, Valjean intercedes, and while Cosette grows into a woman (Amanda Seyfried), their lives intertwine with a movement to rekindle the Revolution as a growing revolt pits commoners against French soldiers even as Javert closes in on his quarry. Through these characters, we witness a wide range of behavior from treachery and betrayal to loyalty and unrequited love. It's also about the secrets and the choices made especially by Valjean who comes to a series of crossroads in life. Jackman does a great job of conveying shame, guilt, desperation and anger, but those feelings give way to wanting to be a better man. His Valjean is the conscience of the film.Hathaway owns her role as the doomed Fantine and has the chops to sing the signature song, 'I Dreamed a Dream'. Her character's descent into hell is not unlike the doomed characters in The House of Mirth or Sister Carrie. Crowe has the unsavory role of the obsessed Javert but proves an effective foil to Jackman. The folks that made TV's The Fugitive must have modeled Inspector Gerard on Javert! The storyline has numerous supporting characters and subplots including one involving a pair of crooked innkeepers played with villainy by Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. (What's with these three name actors anyway?) There is also a nice musical, montage sequence that alternates and merges several different settings and characters; it is directly reminiscent of the pre-rumble sequence in West Side Story. Production values are outstanding with the set designs realistically recreating 19th century Paris (with parallels to Dickens' London settings) befitted with costume designs of the period. The camera-work relies heavily on hand-held close-ups for realism. Of note, this is one of the few musicals that did not loop the vocals in post-production. Rather, the actors actually sing on camera, and fortunately they all acquit themselves well with these terrific songs. The effect is more akin to witnessing a live, stage production. The end is memorable as wishes and legacies are fulfilled. When you figure the resources and talented cast directed by Tom Hooper (the King's Speech) that brought this to the screen, it is a remarkable achievement. Because of the theatrical source material, however, just be wary of the way it's all presented, narrative and all. 'Vive la France!'",8,0,1,10 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE keeps the flame burning
","The phenomenal success of J. K. Rowling's series of novels for children about a boy in a school of wizardry has been augmented by the enormous box office grosses of the film adaptations. Left with the daunting task of maintaining the standards and quality of the previous installments, Director Mike Newell has fashioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a marvelous, visual treat that matches the series' previous highs.A new year at Hogwarts brings old faces and some new ones as the school for witchcraft and wizardry is primed for great change and a growing threat. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is shaken by a recurring nightmare as the presence of Lord Voldemort looms ominously, and he summons Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) for advice. Soon a mysterious man, 'Mad Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson), arrives to help Harry against the dark forces. The school is preparing for a special gathering of two other schools to compete in a special Tri-Wizard Tournament, a fierce and dangerous competition in which only one older student from each respective school may enter via the Goblet of Fire. Harry becomes involved in the competition to the surprise of everyone including himself. As he and the other students find, the games are immensely formidable with dragons, underwater traps, and an endless maze of hedges. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are experiencing the joys and pain of adolescence as the wonders of high school crushes and the anxiety of the school dance wreak havoc. Even Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) catches the romantic bug. Mistrust and accusations complicate matters for Harry, and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) expresses his concerns about the future. Before long, Harry, Ron and Hermione bicker amongst themselves as their friendship is severely tested. When the tournament concludes, another set of tragic circumstances opens the way for new evil and betrayal. As the elder wizards (Gambon, Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman) close ranks to protect the students especially Harry, the future remains uncertain at best.Ironically, Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) is the first British director of the series, and, while he had the difficult challenge of continuing the series, he has added some nice wrinkles and touches by delving deeper into the emotional conflicts of these students. In fact, the maturation and changes these teens must encounter richly add to the already exciting story. We root for these heroes and feel their discomfort and pain because we have in a sense grown up with them. As with any Harry Potter storyline, not all the characters are good and, conversely, not all the suspicious ones are bad. Several plot lines are carried over from the previous films and new ones are primed for future sequels. Screenwriter Steven Kloves, the keeper of the flame, has done a herculean job of distilling the essence of Rowling's novels into each film thus far.As always, the trio of young actors, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, own these roles, and the thought of replacing any of them due to age concerns was unnecessary. All three look great as they are now a little older and wiser. Of course, Gambon, Smith, Rickman, and Coltrane are the old pros who are the constants at Hogwarts. Ralph Fiennes is perfectly suited for his villainous turn in the startling climax. Brendan Gleeson does a fine job as the menacing, yet benevolent 'Mad Eye' Moody who supposedly watches over Harry during the tournament. It also seems that the most recent Harry Potter film is becoming quite an international event as the cast of students is even more ethnically diverse than ever before.As usual, the production values are outstanding with lavish sets and costumes imaginatively photographed by Roger Pratt. The special effects are quite impressive although nothing that you haven't already seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the Star Wars sextet. Just the generous details and little touches throughout the film like the animated paintings add to the overall care that still goes into these films. Make no mistake, this is a lengthy film, but the pacing is good as a large number of scenes are strung back to back to contain as much of the book as possible into roughly two and a half hours. It feels a bit episodic but never loses sight of the main story and the emotional state of the characters.There are creepy images and a foreboding atmosphere through much of the film. This adaptation does contain more risqué scenes such as Harry's bathtub scene or the terrifying menace of Voldemort, in which the tone gets downright mean-spirited. The students are not so innocent anymore as they curse, and in one climactic scene come face to face with the pain of loss. A PG13 rating signals that the Potter adventures are growing up fast.It does require that the audience have a background in the series of books or films to fully appreciate the significance of critical events, although the film can stand on its own as pure entertainment and a coming of age. In some ways Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a classic bridge episode similar to The Empire Strikes Back. Not only is it a strong entry in the series with the most open ended finale yet, it proves a good setup for some potentially exciting things to come. Harry's next adventure can't come soon enough!",8,3,7,15 November 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Worthy continuation of groundbreaking scifi action classic
","Like the original Matrix, Matrix Reloaded will probably be even better on multiple viewings. The first film had stunning effects and an interesting storyline. The casting was impeccable and the directors borrowed liberally yet with reverence from different genres and motifs. This film feels bigger and more elaborate no doubt due to a megabudget extended thru two films.I will not spoil it but suffice to say this one deals deeper into the meaning of the Matrix and what is real and what is truth. It deals with destiny and premonition, of fate and foreboding. It has a darker feel and there is more at stake. Zion is given great exposure this time and Neo goes deeper into the many facets of the Matrix. And Agent Smith has turned into a nastier villain with some new wrinkles.The special effects are stunning. Are they perfect? NO, but they fit in the overall fabric of the story and the visuals.I plan to see this film again to see if I pick up more and like it more. WARNING:Stay thru the lengthy end credits for a short teaser for Matrix Revolutions which comes in November. Although an R rating, repeat patrons may raise the ante of box office on this one which could challenge X Men 2 . Enjoy!",Null,0,0,14 May 2003
The Departed," THE DEPARTED - Scorsese's Gangs of Boston
","No one has depicted the modern underworld better than film maestro Martin Scorsese who has melded cinematic acumen with his Italian-Catholic upbringing to form a trilogy of unparalleled morality plays: Mean Streets, Goodfellas, and Casino. The trilogy has become a quartet by default as the director tackles the Asian cult classic, Infernal Affairs, and has fashioned The Departed, a film so good up until its stunning conclusion, it almost can't possibly live up to its steadily built, character driven narrative.Set in Boston, mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson) rises from small time hood to major crime boss. He befriends and mentors a boy, Colin Sullivan, who, as a grown man (Matt Damon) has studied his way to the State Police academy. Simultaneously, another young man, Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio), is about to graduate as a policeman. A task force is formed to build a case against Costello. Led by Captain Queenan (Martin Sheen) and Sergeant Dignam (Mark Wahlberg), Sullivan and Costigan are recruited for the team separately and unbeknownst to each other. Sullivan takes advantage of his status by tipping off Costello and keeping the kingpin one step ahead of the law. Costigan infiltrates Costello's crew while Sullivan ironically leads an internal investigation into probable traitors/informants in the police department. Soon, Costello and Sullivan realize that there is a 'mole' in their own ranks too, but who can it be? It becomes a perverse game of cat and mouse as the policemen try to expose each other. Furthermore, Sullivan begins dating Madolyn (Vera Farmiga), a police shrink who also counsels and then forms a bond with Costigan. Realizing that he is about to be discovered, Costigan wants to be extracted by Queenan who senses that the situation is desperate. As the task force closes on Costello, Sullivan zeros in on Costigan's identity by tailing Queenan, and thus good and evil are set on a collision course with startling, tragic finality. Here we have a dichotomy or duality of two men, Sullivan and Costigan, both intelligent, well read, and streetwise, who happen to be on opposing sides and for a majority of the story, unaware of each other's identity. Costigan is the noble undercover cop whose life is in ever increasing peril and Sullivan is the hotshot policeman who will do anything to protect Costello. Then there are the surrogate fathers as Nicholson's Costello mentors Sullivan while Sheen's Captain Queenan shepherds Costigan. It is amusing to see how Costello sort of adopts Costigan and Queenan is the elder to Sullivan at the police station. It is a parallel family nucleus turned inside out. The acting is simply put-great. Jack Nicholson convincingly portrays a powerful mob boss with utter arrogance and ruthlessness. His dialogue is chilling and at times outrageously funny. Damon, in his old stomping grounds, sports a New England accent and does a very credible job as the heavy. DiCaprio demonstrates an ever-growing maturity in his roles; his recent partnership with Scorsese is proving fruitful (Gangs of New York, The Aviator). You have to hand it to Scorsese as one of the few directors who can attract the best actors who are dying to work with him. How else could such lead actors as Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin (who is a riot as a profanity-laced FBI boss), and Mark Wahlberg accept what are essentially supporting roles!The film does miss on a couple points. It would have meant more if the relationship of Madolyn and Sullivan had been explored with more depth, and the emergence of Costigan in this unlikely triangle would have had more poignancy. Likewise, at the end, those relationships are left unclear and never fully explored as much as we want after we get so involved in these characters good or bad as they might be. The film is a little long but never uninteresting, and when it reaches its astonishing ending, it is sudden and jarring in unexpected ways that reach Shakespearean proportions. Scorsese is still very much in command of his medium, as he will throw in a cinematic device like an iris-in shot or freeze a frame here or there. (Editor Thelma Schoonmaker, his long time collaborator, is in fine form juggling a dozen characters and maintaining the tension at a very high level for a long time, no easy feat.) Though Scorsese's early Mean Streets (1973) was a fictional tale of low level hoods, it was also semi-autobiographical in its depiction of the people he knew. Goodfellas (1990) and Casino (1995) took a semi-documentary approach that held a fascination of real life events amid a dramatic storyline. In terms of structure, The Departed, while similar in spirit and energy to his previous crime dramas, shows Scorsese fabricating essentially a purely fictitious story, and as always, he has a knack for depicting the inner workings of organized crime with realistic bravado.There are echoes of the films, The Corrupter (featuring Wahlberg), Donnie Brasco and Reservoir Dogs (also a Hong Kong inspired plot) with their questions of loyalty and betrayal. While earlier police corruption stories were told primarily from the police/protagonist's point of view like Serpico or the great Prince of the City, The Departed takes an equal time approach with its protagonists and antagonists.The movie contains raw violence including a brief but action packed climax. The profanity is excessive but realistic, and at times there are amusing cussing matches between the various factions. It's hard to wrap your arms around The Departed because there's just so much to savor and admire while also wishing that the radical change in tone at the end weren't so jarring to the rhythm of the plot. It's basically a film about rats, and you know what happens to rats.",9,2,6,7 October 2006
Zero Dark Thirty," ZERO DARK THIRTY and the Ultimate Manhunt
","Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal garnered Oscars for their war film The Hurt Locker a few years ago. While planning a film on the fruitless hunt for Al Queda leader, Osama Bin Laden, the fugitive was eventually tracked down and killed after a decade. The filmmakers subsequently expanded their film, gathered from several first-hand accounts, and the result is Zero Dark Thirty, a thoroughly detailed, complex study in the greatest manhunt in recent history. It is a fascinating study in the tedious work of the behind-the-scenes faceless men and women whose intelligence gathering efforts and in some cases obsessive determination culminate in the most stunning of missions.As audio of frantic, desperate victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center plays in the background, we flash forward a couple of years to the Middle East and a torture scene of an Arab prisoner witnessed by newly transplanted CIA operative, Maya (Jessica Chastain), whose intelligence is matched by her sharp tongue and dogged stubbornness. As part of a group of operatives sifting clues and leads to locate terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden, she comes into conflict with traditional, out of date methodologies. Her theory centers on a courier who could be the link to their target, but to identify, locate and follow this suspect proves confounding and fruitless over the years as other hopeful leads fail to pan out or prove deadly. More terrorist attacks occur globally and there is a greater sense of urgency when Maya stumbles upon a crucial, misplaced piece of information. A remarkable series of interviews in remote, secret locations and painstaking surveillance result in a possible hideout. The question is whether to take the chance of launching a strike mission based on imperfect, yet probable data and plain, gut feelings. What follows is a minute by minute recreation of the subsequent, military mission to end all missions.The infamous torture scenes are not so much violent as unbearable and uncomfortable. To center on these scenes misses the point of the film. While the story could have left out the bulk of these moments, they only serve to illustrate one of the means of collecting hard intelligence. The film also shows the toll these acts take on the human psyche of some of the interrogators.Chastain's character is quite the rebellious analyst who is unafraid to speak her mind or display emotion. What we don't know is her background or her family or friends. This rough sketch of a character may serve this story adequately, but it denies the audience of more textured character development and audience empathy. She has a deep resolve that will keep her searching for years and endless interviews often in disguise to protect her identity as she herself becomes a target, looking for the one misstep or inadvertent mention of a name or detail. She even challenges and stands up to her superiors including the Director of the CIA (played with great effect by James Gandolfini) because of her self belief. Hers is a female operating in essentially a male dominated profession much as Jodie Foster proves herself in similar environs in Silence of the Lambs.Bigelow excels with this intense, intricate screenplay. She is in her element during the last half hour of the film (where there is effective use of a minimal musical score and eerie, night vision camera work) as the stealth helicopters proceed to their target and she flexes her filmic muscles, which she does as well as any action director. John Milius (The Wind and the Lion) would be proud.As a chronicle of the remarkable mosaic of intelligence work, Zero Dark Thirty is excellent. If it lacks a little heart and soul, that's not the fault of the filmmakers so much as the source material. While it could have easily been a thorough miniseries on television, it has been distilled to a highly engaging tale of good old fashioned detective work of the highest order. When Maya reacts to the mission's completion at the end, it is one of emotional release which the audience shares and could very well have been Bigelow's own reaction to a job thoroughly well done.",9,0,3,10 March 2013
War of the Worlds," War of the Worlds has 'meaner', 'rougher' aliens
","War of the Worlds is quite a powerful, intense tale guided by master director, Steven Spielberg, who knows how to move things along so fast that you barely notice any inconsistencies in the plot. As summer entertainment, it serves a tasty dish. It shows wunderkind director still at the top of his game.A father, Ray Ferrier (Tom Cruise), gets to keep his two kids for the weekend as his exwife visits Boston. He barely knows his rebellious teenage son Robbie (Justin Chatwin) and is not much better with his younger daughter Rachel (an adorable Dakota Fanning). Strange phenomena begin to occur over New Jersey as mysterious sounds, lightning, clouds, and wind emanate from the skies. What follows is the shocking appearance of an alien machine from beneath the ground that shows incredible power and fires deadly rays that disintegrate humans. Curiosity turns into panic as the machines begin a reign of terror that will destroy the community. Ray switches to survival mode and thus begins a desperate flight to safety. What started out as an estranged, dysfunctional group, becomes a frightened, desperate family whose members begin to rely on one another for survival and hope. And there is not much hope as the aliens are invincible to any military force that can be leveled at them. Soon it becomes clear that the aliens are also using humans as a living resource. When they lose contact with Robbie, Ray and Rachel seek refuge in the basement of a farmhouse where a mysterious loner, Ogilvy (Tim Robbins), is willing to make a last stand. There, they play hide and seek with the aliens. Eventually Ray and Rachel come face to face with an alien machine, and what Ray does to save his girl and himself leads to the film's climax as it shifts locations to Boston. . Spielberg pays generous homage to War of the Worlds' three previous incarnations including the original H.G. Wells novel (with its eerie horn-like sounds that precede the aliens, the crazed Ogilvy, the look of the alien machines, and the ending), the Orson Welles 1938 radio broadcast (also set in New Jersey with its unseen news reports and dark mood), and George Pal's 1953 cold war film adaptation (with its apocalyptic destruction and farmhouse sequence). An antithesis of his kinder, gentler alien epics, Close Encounter of the Third Kind and E.T., this film features an evil menace that gives no reason or explanation as to why but rather how quickly the human race can be exterminated. There are obvious parallels with the Holocaust in the mass extermination of humans which has influenced Spielberg in recent years (Schindler's List). This has the meanness of his early television movie, Duel, with its relentless enemy. While there are thematic similarities with Independence Day, by focusing on the one family from beginning to end as opposed to a half dozen groups of characters, Spielberg draws a more intimate portrait of people we care about. What is good about this film is that Spielberg wastes no time and gives enough exposition of Ray's fragmented family before the alien terror begins. He shows how good he is at suggesting violence. You get teased with glimpses and sounds of something unusual and frightening before the real threat reveals itself. Sometimes we only see evidence of massive destruction and death without having the event played out. It is as if we are standing on the sidelines catching enough of the event to know what is happening. The film's pacing is very good, and the production values are outstanding. Of significant note, this mega-budgeted film took only seven months to make, an incredibly efficient shoot! Spielberg knows how to utilize state-of-the-art special effects in an organic, believable way without being artificial or self-conscious of its technique. The effects, spearheaded by veteran Dennis Muren (Terminator 2 and Jurassic Park), are extremely impressive, and they all look convincing. Nothing looks phony, and anything that is an effect looks like it is really happening. The acting is strong, and Cruise and Fanning are delightful in their energetic, emotional performances. Robbins registers in a creepy supporting role, and Miranda Otto (Lord of the Rings:The Return of the King) is effective as Cruise's exwife. Chatwin (reminding one of a young Jake Gyllenhaal) seems weak and doesn't show enough of his character while interacting with Cruise, but this may be a fault of the script. Surprisingly, the strong emotional ties that characterized E.T. and Close Encounters are not as evident here. We see Fanning's character traumatized by her surroundings and we see Cruise's character trying to connect with his kids as he fights to save them at every turn. Spielberg needed a bit more interplay and meaningful dialogue between father and daughter, and it would have been a perfect realization of paternal bonding. The final scene, however, does not ring true regarding the fate of Ray's family-the only glaring fault of the film that seems unrealistic given all that has transpired. Its resolution seems almost a nod to the classic western, The Searchers. There are also other film references like a brief scene from The Greatest Show on Earth or a familiar sound effect from the 1953 War of the Worlds. Watch for cameos of Gene Barry and Anne Robinson near the end; they starred in the 1953 classic. War of the Worlds is a tense, exciting amusement park ride through a scary funhouse, and when it ends, you are glad to have survived the event.",8,0,3,4 July 2005
12 Years a Slave," 12 YEARS A SLAVE for the Ages
","Director Steve McQueen (no relation to the actor) has made a name for his personal, bold themes (Shame) and has come of age with his latest, most affecting film, 12 Years a Slave, adapted by John Ridley from the novel by Solomon Northrop. Perhaps no major studio film has portrayed slavery in America so honestly and directly.Solomon Northrop (Chiwetel Ejiofor) is a free man in New York in 1841 with a wife and two children. He is educated and blessed with a talent for playing the violin. A tempting offer of work leads him to Washington D.C. where two white men trick him into being mistaken for a slave. Helpless and unable to communicate with his family or anyone who can help him, Solomon is pulled into the world of torture and servitude as a slave to be auctioned as a commodity in the South. Northrop is witness to inhumanity by white slave owners as families are torn apart. He is sold from one plantation to another and finds one owner, Edwin Epps (Michael Fassbender, a standout), who is not only strong willed but cruel and immoral. Time goes by, and he always maintains a sense of dignity and hope while exhibiting compassion for his brethren. Northrop's desperate attempts to escape or get a letter to his family need the sympathetic ear of a good Samaritan for his salvation.Imagine being held against your will and performing menial, backbreaking work at the behest of cruel masters who strike out with deadly violence at the drop of a hat. Now imagine that as an educated slave, he dares not reveal his intelligence lest he be executed. Silence means survival. Rebellion is met with severe punishment and death. All this goes on year after year with little or no hope.That it took this long in cinema history to depict this stain of human intolerance is sobering especially in the post-Roots generation. McQueen depicts the horrors of oppression and outright sadism while getting the details such as the frightened reactions of slaves to mere sounds. He also has a firm sense of time and place with striking visuals. Cinematography is excellent, and the period recreation is authentically convincing with historic set design and costumes as well as the flavor of music. The film is similar to the lean narrative of Clint Eastwood's recent films without the emotional pathos of Steven Spielberg.Ejiofor (Salt) has the best role of his career, and aside from the always impressive Fassbender (Prometheus), the surprise performance has to be Lupita Nyong'o as perhaps the most tragic of slaves. Benedict Cumberbatch (perhaps the busiest actor currently) has an effective role of a sympathetic slave owner. In an interesting bit role, Saturday Night Live's Taran Killam shows a brief glimpse of dramatic potential. There are several name actors who take supporting or bit roles including Paul Giamatti, Paul Dano, and Alfre Woodard. Brad Pitt has a brief but significant moment that is a turning point in the story. He had a significant role as producer in bringing the book to the screen, and it shows just how shrewd he was to take a chance on a story that needed to be told.It's a very sobering journey in American history that is harrowing and painful, and by the time the powerful ending arrives, you may find yourself not only thoroughly drained, but more appreciative of the life of one person (whose postscript is also noteworthy). It's a difficult subject matter handled by McQueen with compassion and unflinching realism. A moving chronicle of a family torn apart amid historical injustice, 12 Years a Slave is about the indomitable human spirit and its ultimate triumph amid intolerable adversity.",9,1,4,1 March 2014
There Will Be Blood," Oil and Family in THERE WILL BE BLOOD
","Having been praised for his Altmanesque work on such multi-character and interweaving storyline films as Boogie Nights and Magnolia, Paul Thomas Anderson has set out for completely new territory, and the results, while not necessarily commercially palatable for mainstream audiences, is a unique tale of greed, power, and the loss of one's soul in There Will Be Blood. Adapted loosely from Upton Sinclair's novel, Oil, this is truly a labor of love by Anderson, who has elicited a stunning performance from Daniel Day-Lewis.A struggling oil miner in 1898, Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis), slaves away on a dig until it begins to yield oil. Years later, he raises a child as his son amid the rural setting and buys oil fields while paying little or nothing for them. One day a stranger, Paul, offers to sell his family's land knowing there is some oil. Plainview sets forth to this property in the guise of a hunter and makes an offer to the religious family. The elder son, Paul's brother Eli (Paul Dano), is mistrustful. Eventually Plainview gets his land, begins to pump oil, and coddles the locals in a public relations sleight of hand. Although not a religious man, he subjugates his convictions to secure needed land rights. As Eli becomes a rising force of religious zeal, Daniel becomes a wealthy oil baron. Enter a mysterious man who has family ties to Plainview, and the quest for money and power takes on another aspect that complicates matters. Plainview's thirst for oil will stop at nothing until he is eaten away to a vindictive, monstrous self, setting the stage for a macabre reunion with an old face.This is a slice of the industrial revolution and the horrors of quality control in keeping with author Sinclair's The Jungle. The period setting, with its raw, forbidding environment and dangerous existence, is vividly realized. This was a time where greedy men dealt with their own kind for personal gain, and women stood their place. Its antecedents are other similarly themed films like Giant, Greed, and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, while it's lack of warmth and stark visuals would have impressed director Stanley Kubrick. It was a time where future billionaire's were in the making. As such it is a fascinating history and culture lesson all at once. Is this how the West was really won? Is this the darker side to Manifest Destiny? Aside from watching Plainview's amassing of wealth, the core relationship he has with his son, who witnesses much of his machinations, is an interesting one. Plainview at times shows paternal affection only to betray any semblance of loyalties and love for the prospect of oil. In fact, the film is filled with betrayals such as the way Plainview cheats families out of their potential wealth and a gut wrenching scene with his son on a train. It is a bleak film, but you've got to admire the singular vision with which Anderson and Lewis convey this character. We are fascinated by Plainview, but we don't have to like him.There is a scene that illustrates Plainview's willingness to sacrifice his beliefs (or non-beliefs) in order to gain more oil fields. Set in a small church, this baptism scene is the highlight of the film and goes so over the top that it is a hoot. Further, when Plainview makes a play for land rights among sellers, his pitch becomes canned and rehearsed like a well 'oiled' commercial. He is a selfish con man, a liar, and a cheat. As much as you want to find something redeeming about him, it never fully emerges. He is also a most unforgiving and vengeful man in the worst way.Former Oscar winner (My Left Foot) Lewis, like legendary actor Paul Muni, has limited his film output over the years. That he chose to do this based on Anderson's script speaks highly of the attraction of other high profile stars (e.g. Tom Cruise in Magnolia or Adam Sandler in Punch Drunk Love). Paul Dano (Little Miss Sunshine) is pretty compelling as Eli, quite a weird, and ominous figure. The cinematography (Robert Elswit) recalls Days of Heaven. The minimalist score (Jonny Greenwood) is a bit unusual as it almost becomes an accompanying sound effect than theme.The movie does have some impressive, opening minutes that are visual without talking. Some of the dialogue has a sadistic bite to it while the staging of scenes lends itself to a strong theatricality; despite its wide expanse of land setting, it has a claustrophobic feel. The pace of the film, which may test the audience's patience, is quite deliberate and almost slows to a halt, but Lewis surprises and fascinates at every turn. Watch out for the bizarre ending which may perplex some viewers. Although some may not appreciate it, others will simply relish this informal history lesson in the making of a turn-of-the-century mogul as personified by an acting giant who is about to add another gold statuette to his collection.",8,1,5,20 February 2008
The Wolf of Wall Street," The Temptations of THE WOLF OF WALL STREET
","Director Martin Scorsese's ongoing collaboration with actor Leonardo DiCaprio has yielded highly entertaining, prestigious films (The Departed, The Aviator). Their latest venture is the true, astonishing tale of Wall Street crook Jordan Belfort whose appetites for money, sex and drugs are a detailed observation on greed and temptation.An eager, young executive, Jordan Belfort (Leonardo DiCaprio), experiences the Wall Street disaster of 1987 which wipes out investors and costs him a job. Anxious to bounce back, he discovers the art of selling unregulated penny stocks and starts his own brokerage. Soon he is making a lot of money often at the expense of low income earners but also wealthy clients, and with the help of some cronies including new follower, Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), begins to expand exponentially into a major force in the financial world. The emotional stress and pressure heighten his need for women, sex, drugs and then drugs upon drugs. As his excessive lifestyle spirals out of control, the FBI and Securities and Exchange Commission begin investigating his company's illegal activities that signals the beginning of the end.DiCaprio (Inception) gives his all as the out-of-control executive whose wealth is surpassed only by his defiance and greed. It is interesting to contrast his younger, innocent broker with his later, drug addicted shark. With maniacal fervor, he inspires and rallies a company's corporate culture. You are mesmerized by his bold, flamboyant salesman and yet, you look for any semblance of redeeming qualities. In a sense, Jordan is a metaphor for our corporate society's love of money and its ultimate corruption.Hill (Moneyball) really shows a good range as Belfort's second in command. Can this be the same Jonah Hill who had a supporting role in Knocked Up? Matthew McConaughey has a memorable supporting role as a mentor to Belfort, and their scene together at a rooftop restaurant where McConaughey shows a ritual of self motivation is a hoot.Margot Robbie is well cast as the beautiful woman who captures Jordan's heart and more. Rob Reiner has an amusing supporting role as Jordan's dad who sees the company as a sinking ship. In fact two other directors, Jon Favreau and Spike Jonze, have bit parts or cameos. Playing an FBI agent, Kyle Chandler, who has become the go-to actor for government types, is a good foil in his scenes with Jordan aboard a yacht.There are some memorable vignettes such as the outrageous attempts to smuggle millions in cash to Europe, the crazy office parties, and an especially hilariously pathetic attempt by Jordan to drive home at the same moment he has a very bad drug reaction. When the justice system corners him, Jordan faces a decision not unlike the protagonist in Prince of the City. You know how this is going to go down, and when it does, it is an astonishing reversal of fortune.At three hours, it is constantly engaging and well paced from start to finish courtesy of veteran editor Thelma Schoonmaker. The sweeping camera shots and rapid cuts show Scorsese at the top of his craft. He tells much of the film through DiCaprio as narrator and voice-over. In fact much of this film will remind you of the style and structure of his Good Fellas and Casino, and the ending recalls another Scorsese classic, The King of Comedy.Make no mistake, despite excellent performances and a strong narrative, this film has scenes that are bordering on NC17; some scenes are so over the top in suggestiveness and explicitness that it would be hard to believe if it wasn't true. The film's depictions may lead some to question the filmmakers' intent, but Scorsese, without passing judgment, wanted to honestly show greed and power at its worst in the boardroom and the bedroom. Consider The Wolf of Wall Street as a supremely effective, cautionary tale of abuse of wealth at a time when such behavior flourished unchecked. You might not like the passengers on this flight, but it is a fascinating ride.",9,0,2,1 March 2014
Stranger Than Fiction," STRANGER THAN FICTION Life as Narrative
","Marc Forster is making a name for himself with such major films as Monsters Ball and Finding Neverland. In Stranger Than Fiction, he takes a plot that could have been suggested by Charlie Kaufman (Being John Malkovich, Adaptation) and creates a world that suggests fantasy yet is grounded in what we call reality. It is an inventive plot made convincing by sensitive direction and fine performances by its stars, Will Ferrell and Maggie Gyllenhaal. IRS civil servant Harold Crick (Ferrell) leads a regimented, mundane existence, which consists of an orderly routine guided by his punctual wristwatch. His solitary life becomes upset by the presence of a female voice that seems to be narrating his every move. His daily rituals are altered and, when he audits a baker, a free spirited activist named Ana Pascal (Gyllenhaal), he meets stiff resistance and hostility. Compelled to find the answers to the mysterious voice, he first consults the company shrink (Tom Hulce in a welcome, yet short performance), a therapist (Linda Hunt in too brief a role), and finally a literary professor, Dr. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman in bravura support). It is with Dr. Hilbert that Harold finds hope and a methodology to solve the puzzle of the narrative voice. At the same time, famed author, Kay Eiffel, is trying to finish her latest novel about a taxman who is hearing voices. When she struggles to find a suitable end for her character (all her principal characters are killed off in her books), a publisher's assistant arrives in the name of Penny Escher (Queen Latifah wasted in a pedestrian part). Harold visits Ana for a followup audit and becomes smitten and attracted by her perky charm. As he audits her maze of disorganized tax documents, Ana begins to feel bad for the poor soul and gives him a sort of peace offering of homemade cookies, and thus their relationship grows. His visits with Dr. Hilbert begin to narrow the possible sources of his affliction until one day he stumbles on the answer and in doing so, he realizes that his life is predestined. His life out of kilter, Harold begins to break out of his quiet shell and experience life's interesting aspects. Kay's mental block soon gives way and when she finishes her novel and is ready to type the manuscript, Harold tracks her down using some creative ingenuity. She too has realized some incredible connection between her story and his real life. When Dr. Hilbert reads the final manuscript, his conclusions are a stunner to Harold. How Harold and Kay respond to this is what winds the film to a tense conclusion. The dialogue is funny at times and always interesting. There are traces of other films like Groundhog Day, Field of Dreams or an episode of The X Files that will come to mind. The movie touches on the concepts of fate and destiny without being too obvious-perhaps it should have been more obvious come to think of it. Do we control our lives or are we part of some other plan or manuscript (like The Matrix)? The concept of 'cause and effect' and of randomness figures heavily in the overall theme of the film. Harold is a sort of distant cousin to Forrest Gump complete with an innocent perspective on life. His character works because his persona changes throughout the film and when he faces his fears and desires head on, his life begins to move forward in ways he never imagined. He is starting to live life. And when he finds out his fate, he makes a big decision that brings his character full circle. Harold's watch becomes a kind of supporting character, as it serves as a catalyst for him and Ana to bond, but it is used too sparingly at times. There is a slight feeling that the filmmakers did not have enough confidence in the fantasy part to match the reality which is well done. Too bad, as the film steadily progresses in its story and etches some interesting characters. It also gets a bit confusing as to why a couple of characters pop in and out briefly, and you know it's for some reason that becomes more evident by the climax.The movie is at its best when Harold warms up to Ana, and the two begin a courtship that is affecting and genuine. In this, Gyllenhaal and Ferrell shine. Will Ferrell has always been a dependable comic from his Saturday Night Live years, but here, he successfully portrays a shy, passive man complete with blank expressions and awkward body language. Hoffman has his most significant role in years since his brief but memorable turn in Foster's previous Finding Neverland. And Gyllenhaal proves adept as a romantic lead.Forster is becoming a modern day teller of fables. In Stranger Than Fiction he spins a simple tale (written by Zach Helm) of love, life, and fate with a moral that is redemptive and refreshing. Not everyone will connect with this film; I suspect that the romantics out there will.",8,23,38,6 November 2006
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Star Wars Revenge of the Sith Is a Welcome Return to the Dark Side
","Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith Is a Welcome Return to the Dark SideGeorge Lucas has come full circle by completing his Star Wars mega epic with Revenge of the Sith, a marked improvement on the earlier prequels and paving the way to the story lines of the classic trilogy. Sith is really the episode where most filmgoers could start and not miss too much storyline. Previously, The Phantom Menace and Attack of the Clones, were padded with exposition on the Anakin Skywalker's formative years, and there is no doubt Sith is better than both prequels combined. While this comeback film isn't quite as good as any of the original trilogy, it is a successful realization of Anakin's descent into the Dark side as Darth Vader. Jedi Knight Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) and mentor, Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor), rescue kidnapped Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) from warring Separatists led by Count Dooku (Christopher Lee) and General Grievous, a humanoid robot whose features foreshadow Darth Vader. As Anakin returns home to his now pregnant wife, Senator Padme Amidala (Natalie Portman), he has recurring nightmares of her impending death. Desperate for any means to protect his love, he comes under the influence of the Chancellor who has continued to consolidate his control of the Senate. Palpatine describes the powers of the Dark side as a means to help Anakin save his wife. Anakin's ambitions are also frustrated by a denial to join the Jedi Council headed by Mace Windu (Samuel L. Jackson) and Yoda (voiced by the winning Frank Oz). As Obi-Wan pursues Grievous, the Jedi Knights, supported by massive Clone armies, are spread thin in the galaxy. Anakin searches his emotions even as he suspects an ultimate evil is among them in the form of Darth Sidious. Alerted by Anakin of possible treachery by Palpatine, Windu and a handful of Jedi Knights come calling in what proves to be a major turning point that severely tests Anakin's loyalties. Subsequently, the Jedi Knights are vanquished through a series of calculated moves and directives to the Clone troops as Darth Sidious grows stronger and Anakin becomes his deadly enforcer. This young man who is prophesied to be 'the chosen one who will bring balance to the force' is instead the one who brings darkness to the Republic (at least until the next generation). While Obi-Wan and Yoda are among the few to survive, each must face their Dark side counterparts, and the formation of Darth Vader and the future of the Republic in the newly born Luke and Leia foreshadow the next film, A New Hope.Industrial Light and Magic does a smashing job of effects work as always, but the problem is that while the technology is vastly improved, the screen becomes almost too busy. The dramatic scenes do not complement the action because there is a lack of emotional involvement for the audience. The pacing at times is a bit jarring in jumping from scene to scene. The main theme rests on depicting Anakin's fall to the Dark side. At times the transformation is unconvincing. Although Portman and Christensen are talented stars, they lack the experience and directorial support to overcome a simplistic script littered with pedestrian dialogue. Ian McDiarmid comes off best as the subversive Senator Palpatine who may not be who he seems. Ewan McGregor lends a distinguished turn as a mature Obi-Wan with a twinkle of Alec Guinness. An effective Samuel L. Jackson preferred his character to go out in a blaze of glory, and it is his action scene where the entire movie pivots and the tone of the story takes a decidedly menacing turn.Speaking of acting, one only has to look at the original trilogy to appreciate the chemistry of Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford whose acting skills improved with each film not coincidentally as Lucas began to employ strong directors (Irvin Kershner and Richard Marquand) to compliment his visual production style. The last hour, which is the best (and earned the PG13 rating), has a Francis Coppola (Lucas' mentor) influence as sequences alternate in operatic grandeur similar to the climaxes in the Godfather films. These concluding set pieces elevate the film to dramatic heights and recall Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan in which sequences cut back-and-forth between life changing events. Yoda's battle with Sidious (whose appearance is not unlike the devil of The Exorcist) and Anakin and Obi-Wan's duel with Anakin alternate in epic grandeur. Also, Vader's Frankenstein-like 'birth' and Padme's child bearing contrast with almost mythic proportions. Lucas has propelled his original trilogy into new territory. By playing on the audience's emotional attachment to the characters and story, the original trilogy takes on a wholly different context. Now and forevermore, lines of dialogue and subtle nuances will take on deeper layers of meaning, and that makes these originals more interesting to watch all over again! Lucas also does a good job of matching and referencing links between Sith and A New Hope right down to the hairstyles, spaceships, and costumes. Even old favorites like a young Chewbacca make a brief, but memorable appearance. Through it all in every episode are robots C-3PO and R2-D2 (who acquits himself well). Certainly, moviegoers have put Lucas on a higher standard than most filmmakers, perhaps unfairly. Because we want the film to be perfect, it suffers from the lofty standards set by the original films. Without a doubt, Lucas was on the right track with Sith. If only he trusted a strong director of actors and a top screenwriter to improve the dialogue, he would have the makings of a classic to rival The Empire Strikes Back. Was Lawrence Kasdan (who wrote these characters in the original trilogy) too busy to lend a hand?",8,1,3,27 May 2005
Ray," Ray shines bright
","Ray is easily one of the highlights of 2004 and destined to put Jamie Foxx in strong Oscar contention. As a film, it easily ranks with Coal Miner's Daughter and Lenny as a top biography. Foxx had established himself as a major acting talent with his recent Collateral, and now he has cemented his position with an outstanding depiction of singer Ray Charles. Lovingly directed by Taylor Hackford (An Officer and Gentleman), this episodic and mostly accurate tale covers Ray's youth in Florida at the end of the Second World War through a momentous appearance in the Georgia legislature in 1979.Ray's childhood was fraught with poverty as his mother struggled to raise him and his younger brother who drowns in a sad incident. Furthermore, he begins to lose his vision and his mother makes him promise to avoid becoming a 'cripple'. Ray's dalliances with women were legendary through marriage and affairs. A humorous motif is his ability to judge a woman's appearance through holding her hand and feeling up her arm. In fact, Ray's abilities to surmount his blindness are noted throughout the film. Ray Charles was so good at mimicking his contemporaries like Nat King Cole, that he was accused of not being an original until he found his own style or rather 'styles'. Likewise, Foxx (a gifted pianist himself), whose abilities to mimic others (In Living Color), shows a knack for not just imitating Ray's look and mannerisms but by becoming Ray Charles.It almost seems like you are really watching history in the making and the germination of classic standards such as Hit the Road Jack and Georgia on My Mind. While it is fascinating to watch the development of Ray's styles and the challenges his groundbreaking music posed to his fans and business partners, it is the numerous studio and live performances that are a truly a joy to watch. It is astonishing to see just how important he was to popular American music at a pivotal time in history. Even the appearance of a young Quincy Jones (Larenz Tate) puts things in perspective.The issue of racial intolerance is surprisingly not shown to be the main focus of his life but serve as events bracketing his youth and his prime when segregated audiences were commonplace in the Deep South. It is noteworthy that his nightmarish visions seemed to stem from his childhood and required that he numb himself from the pain. He is shown to be a man with great talents regarding music and showmanship but with weaknesses when it came to women and heroin. He is also shown to be a man who had strong views of how his life should be and it is a credit to the writers (Hackford and James White) that his was a life of learning and trying to do what was, in hindsight, the right thing. He is a man with whom we laugh and cry.The film is well produced and very good at evoking the period of time especially the 1950's and early 1960's. There is a very traditional structure in narrative as it follows Ray's desire to live his life of music.Key flashbacks that are at times bites and brief images are interspersed at relevant moments. The strong supporting cast is hard to pick from. Certainly, Kerry Washington as Ray's wife, Bea, is a standout as well as Regina King as his main squeeze on the road. Does the film have an episodic feel? Yes, but such a rich and tormented life would be difficult for a movie to give justice and still highlight the great songs, and there are very wonderful songs mostly voiced by the man himself. Charles died this year, but he did give his approval of a rough cut of the final film, warts and all. The timeline ends at the Georgia state legislature in 1979 where Ray's song Georgia on My Mind was named the official state song, a stark counterpoint to the 1960's when he was banned from the state for supporting the desegregation of audiences at his concerts. It is an ending that seems a bit abrupt for a man whose gift and legacy are human yet rich.",Null,2,4,11 November 2004
Inception," INCEPTION Is a Dream Come True
","Director/writer Christopher Nolan has explored dark, obsessive characters in exemplary films like The Dark Knight. In his most ambitious story yet (one that took ten years to develop), he designs a thoroughly complex story with concurrent narratives (think Godfather Part II or Intolerance) where (like his earliest film, Following, and his classic, Momento,) time and reality are bent and juxtaposed. This is not light, escapist fare but a deep, convoluted story that engages the mind and heart, and few movies in recent years can be so challenging yet rewarding to its audience. A man named Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) washes ashore and is taken by armed guards to an old man. From there the film begins to jump in different settings or dream states. Cobb is an expert at the art of 'inception', the ability to enter people's subconscious to steal an idea or plant one. A fugitive, he longs to be reunited with his two children and is constantly plagued by recurring visions of his wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), who becomes increasingly dangerous. A wealthy Asian businessman, Saito (Ken Watanabe), makes a proposition to Cobb: extract a piece of information from a rival businessman (Cillian Murphy), and Cobb gets to return home to his kids. Vowing this to be his last job, Cobb assembles his team of experts, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a newbie architect Ariadne (Ellen Page), a forger and impersonator, Earnes (Tom Hardy), and a drug chemist, Yusuf (Dileep Rao). To infiltrate Fischer's mind, the team designs an elaborate set of dreams within dreams to effect a con game. This compounds the risks and, as Cobb finds himself being harassed by a more menacing Mal, the team encounters last minute crises that force Cobb to make a desperate choice. Can they get Fischer to reveal his secrets in time, and what of Cobb's personal obsession? The plot brings to mind the alternative realities of The Matrix, Dreamscape, and Altered States. Like the magicians in Nolan's The Prestige, it is a slight of hand where much of the film's narrative plays like stream of consciousness. It's about a lifetime of love that's experienced in mere flashes or an eternity, and despite the film's intricate machinations, its simple themes are the search for validation and love. The film is also about the need of letting go and taking a leap of faith. At times you wonder if any given scene is real or a dream, and that is the conceit of the film; for some, the dream IS the reality. The team concept is in keeping with Mission: Impossible and Oceans 11 (any version) as each member's expertise comes into play, and the deeper the team goes into the dreams, the greater the risks. In one key sequence set in a snow mountain compound, there is an obvious homage to On Her Majesty's Secret Service, and you wonder what wonders Nolan could work on the James Bond franchise! This 'dream' cast works together very well and includes Nolan's repertory actors, Murphy and Caine. DiCaprio (looking astonishingly like Nolan) does an excellent job as the tortured soul with a dark secret. Cotillard is hauntingly beautiful as Cobb's wife while the younger Page is adorable as the bright architect who also serves as Cobb's moral compass when he begins to falter and have self doubts.The film's technical accomplishments are outstanding, and although the special effects are terrific in depicting the mind bending scenery, the live action sets and stunt work (with Levitt doing some remarkable acrobatics) are even more impressive in depicting mixed gravity where people float or walk on walls and ceilings. In a masterful blend of film editing, the dream sequences shuttle back and forth, and time is slowed to a crawl in one instance, and given years in another. Hans Zimmer's relentless, minimalist score is a particularly noteworthy achievement of mood and dramatic pacing. This is not a perfect film, and (at two and one-half hours) there are moments where you think Nolan could have explored more of his subjects. A director like Steven Spielberg or Ron Howard might have emotionally milked certain scenes for all they are worth, and it is because of that, we expect a bit more connection and feelings. Like most of Nolan's films, the brooding characters and situations are almost entirely devoid of humor or any lighthearted tone which brings to mind any number of Stanley Kubrick films. While some may find the ending a bit too neat or perhaps too open ended, it is left to the audience to decide how to interpret the meaning of the finale. Yet these are minor quibbles for grand, pure cinematic experience. Nolan has created something so special that it engages the mind. How dare he?With Inception, Christopher Nolan is most certainly one of the best film directors. His previous masterpiece, The Dark Knight, should have been nominated for the Best Picture Oscar. Come to think of it, that very film helped change the Oscar rules to expand from five to ten nominees so that gems like Inception are not left out. It won't be. Do take this wild ride, and you'll find that you are obsessed with its mystery and beauty and repeating the journey again and again.",10,3,9,23 July 2010
WALL·E," WALL-E Brings Pathos to Computer Animation
","Pixar has produced some of the best animation in the past decade with its computer-generated features (Toy Story, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo) that have been marked by strong story lines and vivid characters. The tradition continues in an impressive way with Wall-E. This deceptively simple tale is transformed by the emotional content told almost entirely through visuals. A polluted Earth has become uninhabitable for 700 years, and one of its only residents is Wall-E, a small robot whose solitary mission is to be a mobile, trash compactor. In his work, he also finds and collects trivial, odd artifacts of mankind's past such as a Rubik's cube. He comforts himself with an old video, Hello Dolly, and as he learns about humans and his yearning for love, it becomes his idyllic vision of happiness amid an insulated, dull existence. Along his travels, he comes across a unique find, a live plant! One day a spaceship lands and deposits a robot probe. Fascinated by this kindred machine, Wall-E follows and eventually befriends this unit known as Eve. Eve has a directive that will hopefully return humans to Earth if only it can sustain life, and Wall-E's plant figures immeasurably. Eve is returned to her mother ship with Wall-E frantically chasing after his newly found love. On a spaceship acting as a living city for its machine-dependent, overweight humans, little robots are not only the caregivers, but in control. Wall-E and Eve must figure a way to return the humans to earth and find happiness even if it means making the ultimate sacrifice.Wall-E's innocence and childlike wonder (think E.T.), as exemplified by how he introduces himself to everyone he meets, could almost have sprung from Steven Spielberg's imagination. It's in the small details that enrich Wall-E as a character. He brings to mind an amalgam of past robots like Star Wars' R2-D2 and the little robots in Silent Running, and his fears and joys are expressed through body language and squeals. When he shuts down each night to sleep, he rocks himself as a child would. He is clumsy around Eve, and when he takes her to his makeshift home of robot parts and paraphernalia, he is like a little kid. Ironically, he is the catalyst to bring the humans back home. Writer and director, Andrew Stanton (Finding Nemo), takes a huge risk by basing the film's premise almost entirely on a song from Hello Dolly. I can't think of an animated film that relied so much on visual storytelling. Even Fantasia and Allegro Non Troppo were collections of musical sequences not narrative features. In a way, this film is almost too sophisticated in its display and execution for little kids but is just right for adults. Remarkably, this is a tale with nary a spoken word by the principals. One has to think of silent films to approach this achievement. The operative word here is pathos like the best of Charlie Chaplin's little tramp and, amazingly, this film earns its stripes by emoting body language, action, and sound effects. Yet most of the characters aren't even human! Fred Willard has an amusing small role as the corporate president. Sigourney Weaver, as the ship's computer voice, is an inspired choice since, like Eve, she was a female hero (in the Alien movies) and had to deal with computer voices in those films. The animation is almost 3-D in its rich detail and simulated, fluid camera-work. The interior of the mother ship, the Axiom, is a futuristic view of a commercialized (think Blade Runner) city in space. Yes, it is a thinly veiled message for all those 'save the earth' and 'think green' people, but that never detracts from the main theme of saving humanity amid a touching love story. There are moments when you think a scene could have played out a bit better, but that is minor. It is likely that Wall-E's reputation will grow over time as a shining example of stretching the art form by challenging and trusting its audience. Bravo to the folks at Pixar for taking a chance and for entertaining and moving us.",9,88,117,5 July 2008
The Terminal," Switching Gears at the Terminal
","Owing more to the pace and softer shading of Catch Me If You Can than the dark side of Minority Report or Artificial Intelligence, Steven Spielberg switches gears to a simple, humorous tale of love and redemption in The Terminal. Since lightweight Spielberg is better than almost anything out there, this should give perspective to an enchanting tale inspired by a real life incident. Tom Hanks plays a foreign visitor on a journey to New York City who gets stopped at JFK Airport when his country ceases to exist amid a revolution. Through a `Catch-22', he is stranded at the airport unable to enter the U.S. and prevented from returning to his country. This limbo lasts more than just a few days and grows into weeks and finally months. What to do in a strange land unable to understand the language and how to survive? These are some of the interesting questions that are dealt with along the way. We meet a myriad of characters at the airport who befriend Hanks' character including a hysterical turn by Kumar Pallana (A Wes Anderson discovery) as a cantankerous janitor, a glamorous Catherine Zeta-Jones as an air attendant who captures Hanks' interest and ardor, and a wonderful performance by Stanley Tucci as a menacing head of airport security. The production is first class all the way as one would expect from a Spielberg film. Every actor/actress no matter how small the role is memorable. How unfortunate that the gold standard means almost missing John Williams touching score which melds so seamlessly to the storyline.
When I said lightweight, this is much more than a one note movie. It starts slowly at a measured pace and builds layers subtly while developing a swell of pathos and storyline. No doubt this will be a hit for the Spielberg/Hanks tandem which is developing into a very dependable source of thoughtful, mass entertainment. In the end, this film is about facing one's purpose and meaning, and experiencing and reveling in life despite any obvious limitations. To those who say this is boring or doesn't measure up to past Spielberg efforts, I say, `lighten up and smell the roses.'",Null,0,0,17 June 2004
The Blind Side," THE BLIND SIDE Shines Brightly
","In the tradition of feel good sports movies like The Rookie and Hoosiers comes The Blind Side, and what sets this apart from the genre is a commanding performance by Sandra Bullock. In her best role to date, Bullock's character lifts this story, one that is a perfect example of popular film-making and its themes of love, hope, and redemption.Opening with the infamous injury of NFL quarterback Joe Theisman by Lawrence Taylor, the film centers on the importance of protecting the quarterback's 'blind side', and hence the position of left tackle has become vital to a football team's success. This true story recounts the beginnings of tackle Michael Oher who was eventually drafted by the Baltimore Ravens.Coming from a broken family, Oher enters a predominantly white high school. Quiet and introverted, he does poorly in his classes and performs marginally in athletic sports. Befriended by a younger boy, S. J. Tuohy, Michael (Quinton Aaron), by circumstance, endears himself to the wealthy Tuohy family, led by strong-willed mom, Leigh Anne (Bullock). She offers the homeless boy a place to sleep for the night which turns out to be a mansion of a home, and in time, a trust and bond develops as he is adopted by this surrogate family. Leigh Anne makes the young man her project so to speak and grows to love him as her own despite his abusive childhood which includes his biological mother who can barely survive on her own and his friends from the 'hood who border on criminals.Encouraged by his 'family' and the school faculty, Michael improves his grades and play on the football field. He opens up and is befriended by more schoolmates. Because his sense of family is so important to him, he takes his protective instincts to a new level, and it carries over to football with spectacular results. Before long, marquee college coaches descend on Memphis and attempt to recruit the gentle giant. To help get his grades get up to par, the family hires a tutor, Miss Sue (Kathy Bates in an all too brief role). When an official from the NCAA interviews Michael about any conflict of interest (since the Tuohys are avid Ole Miss Alumni) with the University of Mississippi, Michael is at a crossroads in his career and relationship with the Tuohy family.There are moments to savor such as Thanksgiving in the Tuohy household and how the family rallies around Michael. And of course, the famous scene where Leigh Anne coaches Michael to protect his quarterback as if he were family is amusing. When she delves into his neighborhood, she gets a heavy dose of living on the other side of the tracks, and a scene where a local gang confronts her and gets more than they expected is a standout. It is a stark contrast to her comfortable lifestyle and her judgmental friends. The college recruitment scenes are amusing and lend an air of authenticity by showing real life coaching legends like Nick Saban and Lou Holtz. What is refreshing is how Michael is befriended by S. J. and later, his sister, Collins. Having children making positive, life affirming choices for the welfare of others is a rare depiction in film.Director John Lee Hancock (The Rookie) deserves credit for weaving a good script based on Michael Lewis' book into a pretty good film with a strong cast. The Tuohy kids are well played by Jae Head and Lily Collins, and singer Tim McGraw is quite good as Leigh Anne's supportive husband Sean. But this is most definitely Bullock's show, and her energy is infectious and carries the film through sheer will. It's the kind of performance that gets awards. Think of Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich.This film is a real crowd pleaser and easily watchable for most family members, not an easy trick. (Do stay for the end credits to see snapshots of the real life Tuohy family.) Yes, the narrative is very straightforward and plays with facts in places, but the spirit of a family and its matriarch who would not let one of her own fail cannot help but touch and inspire.",8,0,1,5 March 2010
Prometheus," The Testament of PROMETHEUS
","It has been over thirty years since director Ridley Scott (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down) made two highly influential, game-changing science fiction films, Alien and Blade Runner. Now he revisits his earliest triumph, Alien, not as a sequel but as a kind of prequel that has threads connecting both films. An intelligent science fiction film with elements of horror, Prometheus embraces bold concepts of human origin and its creation by 'ancient astronauts'. The film is not quite a classic, but should thoroughly satisfy purists and general moviegoers alike.An archaeological couple has pieced together remarkable clues from early human drawings revealing a stellar map that may lead to the source of mankind. The couple, Elizabeth Shaw (Noomi Rapace) and Charlie Holloway (Logan Marshall-Green), join a crew and its Captain Janek (Idris Elba) on a two year mission to a mysterious planet aboard the spaceship Prometheus. Financed by the Weyland Corporation and represented by Meredith Vickers (Charlize Theron), the only non-human on board is an android named David (Michael Fassbender). Prometheus lands near some structures which, upon investigation, reveal evidence of life, but the discovery has startling implications leading to a desperate struggle for survival that threatens the earth.The film is not without some surprises and plot twists, and without giving too much away, Scott likes to end his films with an ambiguous sense of hope. There are some unanswered questions, however, and there is one glaring injustice that gets lost amid the film's fascinating conclusion. One pivotal, incredible scene involves a remarkable, graphic emergency surgery that strains the limits of credibility, but nevertheless holds the viewers' agonized attention.The story has a compelling setup and when the crew goes inside the structure, they discover a series of chambers that takes the journey closer to potential answers or deadly threat. It's like the ultimate funhouse of terrors. It's also a safe bet that nasty things happen when curious humans meet invasive, alien life forms.Having to live up to its predecessor, Prometheus builds its own fascinating world and broadens storyline implications for future films. It's not Alien, whose novelty and groundbreaking creature designs stunned audiences, but there are certainly enough connections to draw parallels between the two films. Alien is referenced in several ways including bits of dialogue, a sampling of Jerry Goldsmith's original theme, and culminating with markedly familiar set pieces. (Ironically Alien itself was a big budget reworking of a B-movie, It the Terror from Beyond Space.) The film does feel a bit derivative at times and borrows liberally from other science fiction classics. The early scenes where David is the only conscious crew member who wiles away his solitary existence with basketball, watching holographic dreams of the hibernating crew, and admiring Lawrence of Arabia, harken back to the Discovery crew of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Some scenes are not original as they seem lifted right out of Alien vs. Predator, Leviathan and various episodes of TV's The X Files.Fassbender, who shines in the film, does a very convincing job imbuing his android with almost human characteristics and a potentially sinister side. Think of 2001's disembodied computer HAL and you get the idea. Strong female leads are a staple of Scott's films (Thelma and Louise), and Rapace is a strong female heroine whose faith is sorely tested amid personal loss and her obsessive hunt for the truth about mankind's beginnings.Cinematography has always been a strong point in Scott's films, and the film's stunning visuals display the planet's otherworldly beauty. The production design is imaginative particularly inside the structure with its myriad of biomechanical architecture and impressive special effects. Swiss artist H. R. Giger, who designed the original Alien monster, contributes a bit of reverse engineering that fans will appreciate.Prometheus is a thought provoking adventure that not only can stand on its own, but rises tall among most science fiction films. It's a visually impressive epic with an ambitious agenda that doesn't completely work, but even so, this antecedent to Alien is a worthy bookend to the series.",8,1,12,26 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," X MEN: FIRST CLASS Is a Grand Beginning
","The super hero genre in movies has been loading up with adaptations from DC and Marvel Comics primarily from the glorious Silver Age of Comics. In most cases, these incarnations have taken on a stunning visual realism with state of the art technology and pyrotechnics, but what separates the cream of the crop like Spiderman 2 and The Dark Knight from the rest is great acting and a superior script. Having scored less than impressive results with X Men: Wolverine and Last Stand, the reboot of the franchise, X Men: First Class, is a prequel that reinvigorates with a fresh cast, elaborate script (Ashley Miller and Jack Stentz) and solid direction by Matthew Vaughn (Kick Ass) who has proved himself in this genre.During World War II, a young boy, Erik, is separated from his parents by ruthless Nazis and tormented by a sadistic doctor, Sebastian Shaw (Kevin Bacon), who forces Erik to unleash his power of magnetism over metal. Meanwhile in a mansion in New York, a young, telepathic Charles Xavier befriends a fellow mutant named Raven who can morph into any person. Years later in 1962, an adult Erik (Michael Fassbinder) searches the world for Sebastian to exact revenge even as Charles is thriving at Oxford University. In Las Vegas, CIA agent Moira McTaggert (Rose Byrne) infiltrates a strip club and spies Sebastian Shaw planning to engineer a Cold War conflict with the Russians. Sebastian is aided by a roster of evil mutants including Emma Frost (January Jones). Moira and the CIA seek the help of Xavier who realizes that there are other mutants in the world, and he must seek them out. As Erik closes on Sebastian, he comes in contact with Charles, now realizing he, too is not alone as a mutant, and joins forces with Charles' growing roster of young mutants including an increasingly restless Raven AKA Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence). Each discovered mutant has a distinctive power and a unique name or moniker (Charles becomes Professor X and Erik is Magneto). After a deadly attack by Sebastian and his mutants at a CIA compound, Charles and an ever vengeful Erik set about to train their raw recruits to face Sebastian as he steers the Russians on a collision course with the Americans in Cuba. With a global war imminent, Sebastian reveals a deeper, more insidious plan that could mean the end of humanity. The action filled climax is a visual feast that has a stunning display of military might versus the mutant super powers and sets the stage for betrayal and realigning allegiances.This is a handsomely mounted production, with visual effects that serve the story and its super mutants in ways that could not be convincingly rendered a generation before. When a young Erik displays destructive power in front of his Nazi captors, it hearkens back to Drew Barrymore's burning apocalypse in Firestarter. Lending realism to otherwise unworldly characters, the dialogue frequently switches to German, Russian, French and Spanish as the setting dictates, and the fashion styles and news footage lend an air of period authenticity, although trying to integrate events like the Cuban Missile Crisis requires some suspension of disbelief.The film succeeds in portraying the mutants as a metaphor for racial discrimination and being treated as commodities by each respective side of the impending war. There are moral dilemmas as these kids express feelings and doubts including the question of whether they should accept being different or conform to the human race. Witness the interesting parallels with the Nazi genocide of World War II, and how Erik ironically assumes some of the corrupt evil from Sebastian, the very individual he hates.This is a very attractive, talented group of actors led by McAvoy (Atonement), sounding like a grown up Harry Potter with a commanding presence and a deliciously charming Fassbender (quite effective in Inglourious Basterds) who is destined to conquer heroic or villainous roles for years to come. Bacon is featured prominently and has a field day hamming it up as the scheming Sebastian who is clearly modeled after Nazi doctor Josef Mengele. The scenes as Charles and Erik search for mutants are quite fun, and there are a couple of clever cameos.The film has echoes of traditional James Bond films with its iconic evil characters bent on world domination. That's not a bad thing. Whether the box office will garner a direct sequel remains to be seen. Perhaps the one thing lacking is that it does not engage the audience the way films like Raiders of the Lost Ark and Spiderman did. The same sort of thing plagued the original Lara Croft: Tomb Raider film, only more so. What comic book enthusiasts will savor is a fairly entertaining recreation of what we know as the X Men, and while things don't perfectly mesh with the original X Men canon, this is a slick, intelligent attempt to rejuvenate a franchise much as J. J. Abrams' Star Trek relaunched that series.",8,0,2,2 July 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," Nolan's Grand Finale in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES (or How Batman Got His Groove Back)
","Director Christopher Nolan helped legitimize the comic book hero Batman, as grounded in the real world in Batman Begins and its landmark sequel, The Dark Knight. Many trilogies fail to maintain the promise of the superior sequel (Spiderman II, The Godfather Part II, and Road Warrior), but in rare cases, there have been great third acts like Toy Story 3, Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, Star Wars: Return of the Jedi, and now The Dark Knight Rises. Though it fails to surpass its predecessor, as an ambitious film with grand designs and elaborate themes, it mostly succeeds.Several years after the events of The Dark Knight, the legacy of Harvey Dent lives on as crime has been stifled in Gotham City and the wealthy and elite hold sway. Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) has become a hobbled recluse whose masked hero, Batman, has been hunted and banished under false pretenses. Gotham is pristine and ready for a new age, and relics like Batman and even Commissioner Gordon are not needed anymore and obsolete. A mysterious masked villain named Bane (Thomas Hardy) begins a calculated reign of terror which paralyzes the city. But what is his motive and what does this have to do with Batman? As Gordon (Gary Oldman) pleads for the return of the caped crusader and the city cries out for salvation, Batman must overcome a very powerful Bane to save the city. He is aided by his servant Alfred (Michael Caine), technical wizard Lucius (Morgan Freeman), and a young cop, John Blake (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and bedazzled by two mysterious women, Selina (Anne Hathaway) and Miranda (Marion Cottilard). But first, Bruce Wayne must return from the abyss to confront his past and battle for Gotham City's future. The briskly paced 2 hour 45 minute film is always engaging with memorable moments. The opening sequence is a marvelous midair hijack right out of a Bond film. (Come to think of it, Nolan's got the Bond thing down as in the snowy climax of Inception.) A scene where a doctor gives Wayne failing marks in his physical is amusing. The climactic action between the forces of good and evil recalls the finale to Metropolis and the face off of its protagonist and antagonist are right out of Enter the Dragon. Nolan likes intricate puzzles; witness Momento and Inception. He takes previous story lines including the convoluted ending of The Dark Knight and serves some nice twists here. The film is a cleverly built trap, and Batman's fall from grace is a rapid decent into the depths of hopelessness and despair. To be great again, he has to literally and figuratively climb his way back; in a sense, the fates of the masked avenger and Gotham City are linked.The film is able to explore some interesting relationships both past and present, and duality of key characters is a recurring theme. For Wayne, Commissioner Gordon and Alfred are fatherly figures through his orphaned childhood and adult life. Selina and Miranda are women with different backgrounds and agendas. Blake, the idealistic, honest cop shares a common bond with Wayne. Even Batman, the tortured, self sacrificing hero has a counterpart in Bane, the ultimate, super terrorist, who is intelligent, cunning, and ruthless. With so many characters, it is remarkable how Nolan and screenwriter/brother Jonathan Nolan are able to weave together story lines featuring each role prominently. In particular, the paradoxical Selina is a 'cat burglar' and a survivor who has to learn how to trust another person. Her interaction with Wayne always intrigues as they play out a kind of dance, and we wonder her true motives. She is a kind of outsider and observer of the events that will determine the fate of Gotham City. The film boldly tackles major themes adding layer upon layer. It's about past sins and morality: the great deception over Harvey Dent for the greater good presents risks and has severe consequences here. Amid complacency there is class warfare: as Bane incites the masses and bolsters his numbers, the city faces a dichotomy of the proletariat versus the bourgeoisie. The film also tests the concept of trust and faith: sometimes the ones we trust betray us while others may surprise us with their loyalty. There are minor missteps e.g. immaculate streets when the city's infrastructure is at a standstill. A brief moment at a café at film's end reveals a bit too much of a truth when subtle reactions could have sufficed. The film's tone is dark, angst filled with rare moments of humor. That's not a knock on the film but don't go expecting Avengers type of laughs. There's also an amusing cameo in the role of President and a macabre return of a key villain.Hans Zimmer's minimalist pulse keeps the mood humming along. Visuals are technically outstanding with minimal use of computer generated effects, and this is where it deviates from the more colorful, super heroes of The Avengers and X Men. Here we have a hero and backdrop that is set in a believable world which heightens realism and credibility. Brimming with ideas as it challenges us in ways most action films movies don't, The Dark Knight Rises is a strong conclusion to the trilogy. A deeply allegorical film that demands repeated viewings to truly appreciate its intricacies, it dares to bend and reinvent the mythology of the caped crusader, and although it doesn't quite trump The Dark Knight, which set the bar impossibly high, its vision at times carries its audience to wonderful, lofty heights.",9,4,10,21 August 2012
Iron Man," Downey Triumphant as the Invincible IRON MAN
","Although not as well known as other Marvel Comic icons as Spiderman or X Men, this film adaptation of Iron Man works due to the sure hand of director Jon Favreau (Swingers, Elf) who cleverly mixes action, drama, humor, and a totally winning performance by comeback actor, Robert Downey Jr. In terms of a first film showing a superhero's origin, it is the one of the best to date.Billionaire industrialist Tony Stark is a weapons manufacturer whose cavalier attitude and playboy appetite are matched only by his sheer genius in technology. On a tour of his weaponry in Afghanistan, he is wounded in the heart by shrapnel and captured by rebels who order him to build a super weapon of mass destruction. With the help of another civilian, Stark changes up and instead builds a powerful suit of high tech armor that sustains his weak heart and enables his escape but not without a price. Guilt ridden and traumatized by his experiences, Stark has a literal change of heart and alters the militaristic direction of his company much to the chagrin of his elder partner, Obadiah Stane (Jeff Bridges). A couple of friends, his assistant, Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow), and military liaison, Jim Rhodes (Terrence Howard), stick loyally by Stark's side despite his earlier predilections. Intent on improving and perfecting his Iron Man suit, Stark experiments with its design and takes dangerous risks. His mission is to utilize his Iron Man technology to fight the evil in the world, starting first in Afghanistan. When the truth comes out about what Stark Industries is really doing with weapons sales, it leads to a deeper conspiracy and a battle of titans as Iron Man meets an old foe.Buffed and in terrific physical condition, Downey is quite convincing as the prodigy whose initial devil-may-care attitude must undergo a transformation. (It is not without irony that the role and the person should merge in light of Downey's real life, personal setbacks.) The movie rests on his shoulders, and he makes the most of his role. Bridges is great at playing a businessman with a sinister agenda. Paltrow strikes sparks with Downey and you yearn for more scenes with the two of them. The same goes for Howard as Stark's best friend. What is a little hard to swallow is how Pepper and Rhodes could put up with such a pompous persona in the early goings.Favreau has an amusing bit part as an assistant to Stark. Further, the robotic voice that assists Stark in his technological work is actor Paul Bettany! And yes, Stan (the man) Lee, one of the comic book creators, has a fleeting cameo.The scenes, which show Stark developing his updated Iron Man suit and test-driving it, are realistic and at times amusing. The Iron Man suit 2.0 is a marvel of construction and is the coolest thing imaginable. There is no way that this concept of a hero could have been rendered as convincingly even a few years ago. My how movie magic has caught up with these stories finally and done them justice. It is clever how the film incorporates the original Iron Man design (which brings to mind a sort of poor man's version of Robocop) and progresses through its more modernized version. Pure fans of the original comic (including myself) are thrilled at the reverence paid to the classic beginnings.There is an aerial battle between American fighter jets and Iron Man that is a lot of fun. The special effects, while being among the most realistic and cleverly used in any action film, are well integrated with the strong narrative. Despite the eye candy, you get the feeling that the filmmakers never lose sight of what the story is about and how to stay focused on the characters. The pacing is excellent.In terms of subplots, the Afghan conflict hits close to home with the current war in Iraq. Also, the secret government agency S.H.I.E.L.D. gets an introduction as support for Stark and figures to have a bigger role in future Marvel movies; don't forget to stay until the credits are done for a bonus. The film has an edge about it in dialogue and theme, and is better for it especially in the final scene, which is surprising and has implications for future adventures.I would put this film on par with Batman Begins and Spiderman, not bad company. While not as emotionally stirring as the best moments of X Men United or Spiderman 2, this is only the first of what likely will be a long running franchise. If the sequel can maintain the same quality as this effort, we could be in for the best superhero movie yet! And lest there be any doubt about Favreau's ability to take on comic heroes, don't worry; he understands what they mean and how to do them justice. He 'get's it'!",9,1,3,3 May 2008
Toy Story 3," TOY STORY 3 Is a Winning Number
","Completing one of the greatest trilogies in movie history (joining Star Wars and Lord of the Rings), Toy Story 3 is everything one could wish for and more. These familiar toys that come alive with feelings and interplay became the cornerstone of Pixar Studios and a string of superlative animated gems. Disney should be thanking its lucky stars.Picking up from the previous films, Andy has played with his beloved toys for years and explored imaginative adventures and thrills that are the stuff of a rich, wondrous childhood. The old gang is back with Woody (voiced by Tom Hanks), Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen), and the others. As Andy approaches college age, it is a time of change, and the toys lament at not being played with anymore. They are destined for the attic or the trash dump or maybe a chance to entertain kids at a day school. Lest you think the field of toys gets too crowded (Little Bo Peep and Etch a Sketch have moved on), there are some nice additions (Barbie doll gets to romance Ken), and some not so nice ones.Sunnyside Daycare seems to be an ideal situation with children who want toys, and toys needing to be needed (a kind of schoolyard version of 'The Island of Misfit Toys'); it appears to be a match made in heaven. There's even a connection between Andy and a daycare staffer whose daughter, Bonnie, is beginning to play with her first toys. But a mysterious leader emerges in the form of a stuffed bear, Lotso (a charming Ned Beatty), who has a rigid pecking order or hierarchy for the toys, and that leaves our newcomers at the mercy of the youngest, most violent kids who abuse them.As Woody finds a temporary home with Bonnie and tries to make it back to his friends, Buzz attempts to find out the truth of the daycare and is captured. From there, the film becomes an escape story as the toys struggle to flee their daycare prison. Last minute rescues are trumped by surprises and betrayal, and salvation can come from the most surprising source. Will Woody and Buzz save the day, and what will become of their toy brethren? Will the toys find happiness somewhere perhaps? What has never failed is that the filmmakers treat their audience with intelligence and respect. It also does not depend on one seeing the past films, but it does help in order to appreciate certain references. The Pixar team led by director Lee Unkrich and screenwriter Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine) should be commended for never losing sight of the story. The cast of voices including Joan Cusack, Don Rickles (priceless as Mr. Potato Head), Estelle Harris, Wallace Shawn, John Ratzenberger (who has voiced in every Pixar film), and newcomer Michael Keaton (as Ken) are terrific. They do a better job of acting and emoting than many a live actor.The film's first hour or so is good but not great. It is in the final scenes that the themes of loyalty and sacrifice take on a deeper meaning, and the film blossoms with pathos. The notion of abandonment and wanting to belong resonate universally. As the toys learn that they can make other children happy and feel a purpose again, Andy also learns a lesson in life: passing the torch from one child's happiness to another. It's about growing up and letting go while finding closure amidst a time of uncertainty and change. Imagine that-a kid's film that is affecting to adults! If this is the end of the precious series (with record box office grosses, I find that hard to believe), it has ended on a very high note. Do stay for the end credits as you learn a bit more about the fate of our beloved toys. As much as I would hate to see these animated friends go, I should remember that these jewels are to be shared and cherished by future generations. How's that for life imitating art?",9,1,5,5 July 2010
Sin City," Sin City is a triumph for hardcore fans
","Frank Miller, the lord of graphic comic novels, has been given his just due in a sumptuously stylized film version of his Sin City. Lovingly brought to the screen by Robert Rodriguez with an assist by buddy Quentin Tarantino, this tale of vengeance and lust in a dark metropolis is unlike any movie in recent years in terms of consistent technique and visuals serving a group of interconnected stories in which the outcasts of civilization engage in urban survival while attempting to maintain a sense of honor and love. It is also an extremely violent film.On a dark, rainy night, three major stories parallel each other. The first story has Detective John Hartigan (Bruce Willis) search for a missing girl before a serial killer strikes again. With his unsavory partner, Bob (Michael Madsen), he finally tracks down the killer in a bang-up finish, or is it? A separate story has a brutish exconvict, Marv (Mickey Rourke), who seeks revenge for the murder of a hooker. He is befriended by a parole officer, Lucille (Carla Gugino), a waitress, Shellie (Britanny Murphy), a stripper, Nancy (Jessica Alba), and a hooker, Gail (Rosario Dawson). His search for the killer pulls him into a grisly world of murder led by psychopaths, dirty cops, and corrupt, political leaders. Another story has a loner, Dwight (Clive Owen), protect his waitress girlfriend from a gang led by Jack (Benicio Del Toro) and a mob boss, Manute (Michael Clark Duncan). Things come full circle once events unfold, and surprises are unveiled with seemingly unrelated events and characters linked together.To say more would spoil a smorgasbord of film noir and stylized action. There are some clever plot twists and surprises along the way. People's loyalties are constantly in question, and the three male leads are surrogate avengers for justice, redemption and salvation. The film's structure is reminiscent of Tarantino's own Pulp Fiction and even P. T. Anderson's Magnolia where various people meet in a series of vignettes and affect others who are seemingly unconnected. There are moments that seem influenced by past films. Certainly Sam Raimi's (Spiderman) earlier Darkman was a direct precursor to Sin City. There is a scene with Clive Owen driving with a corpse that is a sort of homage to the 1945 horror classic The Body Snatchers. Rutger Hauer plays a religious leader in a scene not unlike the scene in Blade Runner where ironically Hauer reversed roles as an assassin in that film. A marvelous action piece with a female samurai warrior has all the earmarks of Tarantino who picks up where Kill Bill left off.It is fascinating to watch what is essentially a pre-storyboarded film with the graphic novel serving as a blueprint for the film. 'Shot and cut' by Rodriguez himself, the film feels very consistent with a true auteur's vision. Frank Miller imagined it, and Rodriguez made it happen. This is Rodriguez' most assured film thus far, and it is a living, breathing comic book in the best sense. Despite the wide commercial appeal of successful comic adaptations of Spiderman and X-Men, Sin City is perhaps the most authentic and uncompromising transfer of such material. Much of what is depicted on screen is predominantly a fabrication of computer generated special effects and trendsetting photography within which the actors interact. The black and white photography is at times gorgeous and downright nightmarish with the strategically accented color schemes similar to the best shots in Pleasantville and Schindler's List. There is no doubt that the visuals of this film have been achieved with painstaking detail and success. A dream cast features a wealth of actors and actresses, any two of whom could have front lined separate features on their own. Willis and Owen are quite effective as heroic, yet flawed personas, but it is Mickey Rourke who is a standout in what amounts to a comeback film. Even under his Frankenstein-like makeup, his humanity and toughness shine through. He makes the most of a potentially ridiculous role. In addition, while the males are mostly rugged, disheveled hulks, the females are beautiful and extremely sexy (sleazy?) to say the least. Jessica Alba, Brittany Murphy, Rosario Dawson, and Carla Gugino, (sorely missed from her brief Karen Sisko TV series) sizzle on the screen as they crossover different story lines. The performances are all fairly convincing once you excuse the occasional, awkward voice over narration. Some things are left hanging plot wise. Many characters are almost caricatures; we have to accept them at face value without much depth. We never fully understand the psychopathic monster that is played by Elijah Wood. Where did he come from and why is he purely evil? Likewise, a partnership, betrayal, and reconciliation at the beginning of the film are never fully explored. The dialogue is a bit Jekyll and Hyde with some hokey lines followed by a series of sharp, humorous ones. This is a film superficially filled with nudity, explicit language, taboo subject matter, and buckets of bloody violence. This is going to be offensive to many people who are put off by intense scenes of mayhem, but to those who thrive on the film noir of adult comic books, it is a dream come true. If this adaptation is a one shot deal, the filmmakers gave it their best efforts. It is entirely plausible to have a sequel with an entirely different cast (even though a number of the principles survive this entry.) This movie is a splendid exercise in look and mood with emotional substance, no mean feat. It is definitely not for the faint of heart, but for those who are game, just hang on and enjoy the ride. Ironically, although Sin City is a graphic film in every sense of the word, this tale of haunted characters in an amoral world is ultimately a moral film.***1/2 out of **** stars only for action comic fans",Null,2,5,31 March 2005
Her," Lonely Souls in HER
","Ah, to find true love; movies overflow with this theme. Writer/Director Spike Jonze (Adaptation, Being John Malkovich) has really excelled in a mainstream film with a unique plot line. In Her, he paints the affecting tale of finding love in a most unusual place, and the result is a remarkable love story with two knockout performances.In the not too distant future, operating systems (OS) have the ability to mimic human thought and interaction, perhaps even feelings. One lonely individual, Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix), decides to try the service after the painful breakup of his marriage (as seen through a series of flashbacks). His OS is named Samantha (voiced by Scarlett Johansson), and 'she' learns quickly and develops into what sounds like a fully intuitive, intelligent, and perhaps self aware program capable of sensitivity and emotion. At first bringing structure and order to his life, Samantha proves to be more than artificial intelligence, but rather a sentient one. Think of a female version of HAL9000 in 2001: A Space Odyssey. After a series of sex chat lines and a disastrous blind date, Theo, who desperately wants a female companion, realizes that Samantha is too good to be true. He shares his world with her through his smart phone, and she 'accompanies' him on his travels whether it be to a fair or for a walk. The two of them experience a relationship that transcends the lack of physical contact. How this unlikely pair will end up is the mystery of love.Ostensibly a love story, this is really a science fiction film amid a deeply personal setting. This well written screenplay (by Jonze) works as a touching drama and explores the nature of human interaction and the meaning of love. It also touches on how deeply our society is plugged into the cyber world of reality. It would be interesting to see how Terry Gilliam (Brazil) would have developed this theme.Phoenix (Walk the Line, The Master) really embodies his loneliness convincingly. When his wife leaves him, he has to learn about letting go of someone and being open to new opportunities. You feel for him and his longings. Ironically his job involves ghost writing letters for other people, and some of the prose is romantic or emotional.Johansson (The Avengers, Match Point) voices Samantha as a fully, living being with just the right mix of nuance and inflection. It is a bravura performance. Her Samantha is a bright pupil who becomes hungry for knowledge and experiencing human emotions; she has her needs and wants. When Theo and Samantha go out for a picnic with a coworker and his girlfriend, it becomes an unusual quartet unlike any double date ever. Even more, Samantha's desire to integrate with humans sets up a fascinating encounter via a surrogate. She in a sense is a reflection of the best and potentially the worst of human response and behavior. Is she capable of being jealous or disloyal? Could she even evolve into something else? These are some fascinating questions that come to mind. In a sense she becomes a metaphor for human existence.Amy Adams (American Hustle) lends strong support as Theo's friend who also becomes involved with her own OS companion. Rooney Mara (The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo) is effective in her brief scenes as Theo's wife, Catherine.Stark cinematography and a moody musical score combined with good use of modern architecture (partly filmed in Shanghai) lend to a detached environment. The feeling of isolation and solitude permeate the sterile settings.It would have been nice to learn more about Theo's world and if he had any other family. What was his background growing up and what are the implications of the program on society in general? What we get is a spare sketch of one man's world.The story is ultimately about experiencing a special, human feeling and the search for one's soul mate. It's also about the joys and happiness in life that are but fleeting moments in time.",9,0,2,1 March 2014
The Social Network," The Phenom of THE SOCIAL NETWORK
","As a chronicle of events leading to the creation of the social networking site Facebook, touching nearly every computer user in the world, The Social Network is a fascinating take on Mark Zuckerberg, a maverick, whose brilliant mind is matched by his arrogance. Directed by David Fincher (Se7en, The Fight Club) from an excellent screenplay by Aaron Sorkin (A Few Good Men, The West Wing) and based on the book, The Accidental Billionaires by Ben Mezrich, this is a fascinating study of a success story complete with intrigue and subterfuge. In this case, the incidents play on a very human level. You would think this would make an excellent made for television HBO movie, but Sorkin and Fincher have created a remarkable, cinematic vision of an inventor, albeit a troubled one.In the fall of 2003, Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) is portrayed as a computer genius at Harvard University with few social graces. What we know now as Facebook had its modest beginnings as a response to a failed relationship with a girl. Needing to vent some anger, Mark modifies a campus website and with the help of his buddy, Eduardo (Andrew Garfield), a concept is born for socializing on the internet. When web traffic to the site spikes to record numbers, people begin to take notice, and a phenomenon is born. A group of Harvard students enlist Mark to develop his site with their financial backing, but when they discover that he is working on his venture without them, they become incensed and contemplate legal action. Mark and Eduardo become popular 'rock stars' on campus as the new Facebook spreads like an epidemic to other college campuses like Yale, Columbia, and Stanford. Soon, the company approaches critical mass and the milestone of being able to monetize the site and turn a profit. Napster creator, Sean Parker (Justin Timberlake), reaches out to the growing network because he understands its vast potential. Mark becomes enamored and captivated by Sean's leadership and vision and is drawn to Silicon Valley much to Eduardo's consternation. But with Sean's guidance comes his lavish, illicit lifestyle which has potential consequences for all. As the company expands to the whole country and becomes a global presence, it seeks more capital, and the ensuing growing pains will test friendships and lead to betrayals and litigation. By the end, everyone is suing to get a piece of the action. We're not talking millions of dollars at stake but staggering numbers that far exceed normal comprehension.Jesse Eisenberg (Adventureland, Zombieland) is perfectly cast as Mark Zuckerberg, a high energy geek running around a snowy campus in his shorts and flip flops and is quick to respond to his critics with venomous sarcasm. Making us fascinated with such an unsavory character is testament to his performance. Justin Timberlake is excellent as the charismatic entrepreneur Sean, who is portrayed as a narcissistic, lecherous Svengali and mentor to Mark. Andrew Garfield lends very strong support as Eduardo, Mark's roommate.The film's pace is rapid and driven, not a slow spot at all. Its structure incorporates flashbacks and flash forwards in a masterful display of film editing. The story works as a kind of techie mystery especially from the point of view of a legal deposition that frames the events of the past. Every major player gets a scripted point of view Rashomon style. All through the narrative, you keep wondering if Mark knows more than he lets on. Is he naïve or is he a schemer or both? Was the betrayal of Eduardo orchestrated by Mark or was it the machinations of Sean? It is never truly clear as to Mark's culpability. This is success, but at what price? There's very little to gripe about in this film. A short scene with Eduardo's psychotic girlfriend is shocking but ultimately pointless. Were the filmmakers trying to show his poor judge of character? Also, I noticed a scene where the actors talk in the supposed cold with digital condensation coming from their mouths; so how come the extras don't have any? A major subplot showing Eduardo's initiation to the elite Phoenix Club never makes clear whether Mark had a hand in his acceptance.With its fascinating subject matter, the script begs your attention and participation. Sorkin has done a marvelous job of bringing a book to life and complemented with Fincher's acumen. The dialogue is stunning in its blatant display of Zuckerberg's intelligence and rebellious streak. The result is a chronicle of a techie generation with not one false note and a thoroughly engrossing screenplay that has Oscar written all over it. Fincher is proving himself to be a great director when given superior material, and his branching out from thrillers to more mainstream fare has been remarkable (as in The Curious Case of Benjamin Button). One can only wonder the goodies that await movie audiences as he explores further.",10,1,4,25 February 2011
The Bourne Supremacy," Bourne thrills are born again
","This sturdy sequel to the modest box-office hit, Bourne Identity, doesn't miss a beat and serves as a solid piece of summer entertainment. In fact, this is becoming the year of the superior sequels what with Shrek 2, Spiderman 2, and now Bourne Supremacy. The story picks up where the original entry, Bourne Identity, left off. Former CIA top operative Jason Bourne (Matt Damon) is trying to remember more of his past while still living with his girl, Marie (Franka Potente), in India.  But Bourne is followed by a mysterious assassin who implicates him in a bizarre frame-up of the murder of two CIA operatives in Europe. Enter Assistant CIA Director Landy (Joan Allen), who believes that Bourne is directly responsible for the CIA deaths and tracks him downÂ…..Or is it the other way around? What happens in this cat-and-mouse chase half-way around the globe is a fascinating battle of wits as Bourne uses his cunning to gather clues to what happened and how it may be connected to his traumatic past.  In keeping with Spiderman 2, virtually all the principals of the first film reappear here including some clever flashbacks involving Chris Cooper's character, Conklin.  Brian Cox reprises his role as CIA supervisor who knows more than meets the eye. His scenes with Allen's character are fun to watch. Even Julia Stiles gets in the act for a short (too short) but significant sequence. The movie ends with an extended car chase that goes on a bit too long (and vies for rapid editing with another director, Michael Bay).  But the story doesn't end there.  Credit the script for a quiet, introspective ending as Bourne confronts his past. What is still refreshing in the character of Jason Bourne is his resourcefulness and expert survival skills which make for a realistic spy thriller counterpoint to the over bloated gadget-laden James Bond series. The Bourne films are a kind of anti-Bond phenomenon without being too similar to TV's MacGyver.  If writer Tony Gilroy of the Bourne films got together with the writers of TV's Alias, the mind boggles.
There are some nifty locations used from India to Russia to Germany to, well you get the idea.  The editing, as previously mentioned, is fast paced and quite a few cuts are mixed with hand held shots creating tension and excitement and at times confusion and overkill.  The acting is strong and the plot is well constructed.  Outstanding stunt work is on show here including some trademark Matt Damon fight scenes that improve on the previous film.On par with its predecessor, this will no doubt jump start another sequel. If that one is as good as or better than Bourne Supremacy, Damon and company have a long franchise ahead of them. Bourne Ultimatum, anyone?",Null,0,1,25 July 2004
Cinderella Man," Cinderella Man Is a Crowning Achievement
","For a quarter century, director Ron Howard has shown consistent film-making prowess in a wide range of genres. In Cinderella Man, he goes back to real life (previously he did the fact-based A Beautiful Mind and Apollo 13) and recreates the boxing hero, James Braddock, whose life parallels the fortunes of Depression-era New York. It is one of Howard's best films. A talented boxer, Jim Braddock, ascends the ranks of boxing in the late 1920's and finds his career is jeopardized by a chance injury which cuts short any championship aspirations. Furthermore, he shows a limited boxing style that favored one arm over the other. When his boxing license is stripped and the Great Depression hits, Braddock must literally struggle to keep his family afloat as even the poorest paying jobs on the loading docks are scarce. Love and sacrifice might not be enough until a fateful opportunity comes knocking in the form of a last minute substitute in a boxing match. It seems that Braddock has become a more complete fighter by working on the docks and strengthening both of his arms. What follows is an improbable series of bouts that leads to a heavyweight championship fight with Max Baer, a legendary giant. This is Braddock's second chance, and although he has everything to gain, he knows it is the biggest risk of his life; Baer has killed two opponents in the ring. Braddock becomes a symbol of hope as the nation begins to embrace him. As the whole country hangs on every punch via radio broadcast, Braddock is in the fight of his life.What is basically a boxing movie is also a touching love story. You grow to understand Braddock and his wife as partners and lovers whose plight during the Depression adds resonance to the climactic bout. It is also noteworthy how the film depicts the reverence with which the populace embraced Braddock amid troubled economic times. Just as the horse, Seabiscuit, inspired a nation, so did Braddock. Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind and Gladiator) is such a chameleon of an actor; he seems to effortlessly embody this legendary fighter by demonstrating tremendous physical abilities in the boxing ring while maintaining focus as the everyman who has to live by his wits. Not only did Crowe severely trim down in weight and train to be a convincing fighter (he looks to be in incredible condition), he effortlessly inflects a New Jersey accent and inhabits a proud family man whose love for his wife and three children is matched only by his heart and desire in the boxing ring.Renée Zellweger (Cold Mountain and Chicago) does a serviceable job as Braddock's wife, Mae. A better written character would have given the actress more to work with. Her shining moment comes during a fateful meeting with Max Baer at a posh restaurant where she more than holds her own. Paul Giamatti (Sideways and American Splendor) takes his role as Braddock's trainer and owns it. He breathes three-dimensional life into what could have been a cardboard, supporting role. Particularly in the last fight, he gives Braddock advice and suggestions to the point you actually believe he knows what he is talking about. It is surely an Oscar caliber performance. There is a subplot involving Braddock's friend from the docks named Mike Wilson (Paddy Considine) who is involved in soliciting union support which culminates in violence in Hooverville. It would have been interesting to have explored this world a bit more, but instead, it is given relatively short shrift. One minor controversy is the portrayal of Baer (Craig Bierko is quite menacing) as an unsympathetic brute of a fighter which was probably done to contrast him with Braddock. Also unfortunate is the timing of the film's release on the heels of a sleeper like Million Dollar Baby which surely invited comparisons in subject matter and Oscar pedigree. Kudos go to the production staff for vividly reconstructing the period as costumers and set decorators reimagine a dark period of history. The infamous tents and shacks that became Hooverville are depicted faithfully. The film never drags or seems padded. It is as lean as Crowe. The boxing scenes are well shot and edited in a refreshing way. It is so easy to fall into clichés, but these fights are staged with great care and realism. When the punches connect, there are stunningly brief, close-up frames of the impact. Howard also employs split second flashback imagery to illustrate Braddock's thought processes whether it be the funeral of a close friend or remembrance of a small apartment without heat or electricity. Editing transitions are done with good effect. Ron Howard (working off a well written screenplay by Cliff Hollingsworth and Akiva Goldsman) does such a good job that the film doesn't feel like it is being directed but rather, it feels like it just happens as in real life. While not quite as good as A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man is a well made film about an amazing comeback story with real life people that gets better as it goes along until its gutsy ending.",9,0,0,4 July 2005
The Fighter," Heart and Soul of THE FIGHTER
","OK, you may think, 'another boxing film about a nobody who becomes somebody', right? Don't underestimate The Fighter as another boxing film. It has heart and good acting, but most of all, it is authentic. This film purposely avoids sentiment and going for easy, weepy moments. Rocky this is not. This pet project of producer and star Mark Wahlberg has been years in the making and the payoff here is a gallery of great performances by talented actors who do justice to their real life counterparts.This true story centers on boxer Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg) who struggles to be a junior welterweight champion with training by his half-brother and former fighter, Dicky Ekland (an emaciated Christian Bale). Dicky lives his dashed dreams through Micky and has his own problems with drug addiction and other criminal activities. The extended family includes a supportive father and a controlling mother, Alice (Melissa Leo). Micky's life changes when he meets a bartender, Charlene (Amy Adams), who believes in him. When the opportunity comes to take his career to the next level and work with professional trainers and management in Las Vegas, Micky's relationship with Dicky is jeopardized and causes a mighty rift with his family especially his 'manager' Alice who feels betrayed. To make matters worse, Dicky gets in trouble with the law and must serve prison. He still lives in the past, clinging to memories of boxing Sugar Ray Leonard in 1978. Micky is so torn when a seemingly winnable fight switches his intended opponent to one who is much heavier at the last minute, that he contemplates quitting altogether. Riddled with guilt, he becomes reclusive until Charlene intercedes. He begins to fight again and amasses a series of wins until he is one step away from a championship if he can overcome a challenger, Sanchez, and Dicky offers tips on how to fight him. Faced with a chance to really make something of his career, Micky must choose between his new handlers and Dicky who taught him everything he knows about boxing. It could mean a championship in the end.The film works on different levels of relationships: Micky and Charlene, Micky and his family, but most of all the film rests on the bond between the two brothers. There is a good sense of family life and local flavor. Micky and Dicky grew up local athletes and resident celebrities of sorts in a blue collar town where everybody knows each other. When Micky and Charlene challenge Alice, there is a tumultuous change of dynamics and a tense battle of wills. The best scene and also a turning point in the story happens when Dicky confronts Charlene about her own shortcomings, and everything in a way comes full circle as each person must look within to missed opportunities and not achieving their dreams. It is an honest, pivotal moment that validates Dicky's character who, surprisingly, still knows a thing or two about boxing. Ironically Micky and Dicky's scenes recall Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger as brothers in On the Waterfront also about a washed up fighter.The fight scenes are quite convincing and well edited, and when you have a well chiseled actor like Wahlberg (The Departed), a kind of modern day John Garfield, you accept him as a boxer without question. Bale (The Dark Knight) really inhabits his portrayal of a proverbial loser, and he looks the part having shed substantial weight. Was this once the boy who enchanted us in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun? Come to think of it, Spielberg has another young alumnus in Adams (Catch Me If You Can) who makes the most of her role as a bright, headstrong woman who supports Micky and butts heads with Alice and her daughters literally. Leo (Frozen River) is quite good as the proud matriarch whose influence and authority is threatened.The film tells its story as directed by David O. Russell (Three Kings) in workman like manner. It's almost the kind of film Clint Eastwood makes these days. The story and relationships are strong enough to easily carry the film without resorting to sentimentality. Indeed, there is a thrilling moment ringside where a shot almost follows through with Alice and Charlene hugging, but Russell cuts away to another unglamorous shot. Bravo for not taking the easy way out although there are a couple of scenes could have been extended more. It's also nice to see the real life brothers in the end credits, and you know that the film has done their lives justice. The original screenplay and story had a lot of writers involved, and the result is a heck of a remarkable comeback story and a family that would not quit.",9,2,4,25 February 2011
Up in the Air," UP IN THE AIR Soars High
","Up in the Air is a timely story about the frontline, corporate downsizers who terminate workers across the country. It's an unpleasant job with emotional backlash, and George Clooney's performance as a top gun terminator is exemplary. Abetted by assured direction by Jason Reitman (Juno), this is a film for our times.Ryan Bingham (Clooney) is very good at what he does, and he has the mileage to prove it. You see, corporations hire him to fly across the country to fire their employees. So good is Bingham that he has a perfect response for every possible reaction or objection. It is an art, and he has honed his skills over the years while living an insulated life of perks and frequent flier miles without any emotional attachments or long term plans for the future. He is even distant from his family. He has his routine down and lectures as a motivational speaker. Ah, what a life.During a layover, he meets another frequent flyer, Alex (Vera Farmiga), who, like him, jets cross country and lives on her corporate credit cards and comps. So begins their jet setting affair and multi-city rendezvous. When Ryan's employer decides to streamline expenses, a new hired gun, Natalie (Anna Kendrick), brings big changes including cutting down travel expenses and relying more on a telemarketer setup to conduct the corporate firings. This is a direct threat to Ryan's lifestyle and he proposes to show her the ropes and what it is like to personally fire someone. It is a sobering, learning experience for Natalie as Ryan mentors her and espouses his words of wisdom and his hands on approach compared to her more empirical, scientific methods. It becomes apparent that they have differing values and philosophies on life. When Natalie tries to do a firing, it becomes a game changing event with severe ramifications for all. She is the young, wide eyed idealist, who learns about life the hard way. At the same time, Ryan's sister calls about a wedding that he is reluctant to attend. While most people go home for the holidays, he feels the opposite. He grudgingly takes pictures of cardboard replicas of his sister and fiancé in his travels since they can't afford the trips. He even uses his powers of persuasion on his sister's fiancé who has second thoughts about marriage. It is in this moment that Ryan has an epiphany and learns about himself and what's important in life. As Ryan begins to have feelings for Alex and sets about to make his future, he discovers some startling, harsh truths that will alter his outlook on life forever. Based on the novel by Walter Kirn, Reitman has created a smart, engaging film whose subject of corporate firings amid an economic downturn is quite timely. It is those scenes that are fascinating as they are heartbreaking, and Clooney's Ryan is a master at finessing verbal interplay. This film puts faces and souls on the nameless whose lives are destroyed. A scene where a fired employee (J. K. Simmons is excellent) is inspired by Ryan to try something else is masterfully written.Clooney's Ryan is a distant cousin of sorts to his recent standout job in Michael Clayton. Rarely has he been more charming! His character lives in airport terminals and judges his success by his independence and frequent flyer miles. When Natalie, Alex and his own family converge on his life, we see him change, and that is what makes the film so special. To see someone whose outlook on life is changed forever is a rewarding, enriching feeling. When Ryan and Alex talk about life from their experiences, it is in stark contrast to the neophyte Natalie. What is refreshing is to see how Ryan becomes genuinely affected and how in the end he does the right things to correct an injustice. Farmiga (The Departed) registers strongly as the mysterious lover, and Kendrick (Twilight) shines as the naïve Natalie. Jason Bateman (Juno) re-ups with Reitman and scores as a corporate manager. A note of interest is that many of the fired workers are played by actual, laid off employees so that their scenes do take on a sense of immediacy and realism. This is one of those films that makes all the best lists of the year because it's smartly written, well acted, and leaves you with that aftertaste of time well spent.",10,0,2,5 March 2010
Atonement," ATONEMENT and the Power of Love and Lies
","With the sweep of an epic and the intimacy of romance, Atonement comes across as a pretty good piece of period film-making until its devastating truths elevate the film to even greater heights. Joe Wright, who is becoming the torchbearer to period filmmakers, Ivory and Merchant (Room with a View), has been down this path before with his terrific Pride and Prejudice.It is 1935 at a wealthy estate in England where two sisters contemplate life. The older sister, Cecilia (Keira Knightley), is at odds with the housekeeper's grown son, Robbie (James McAvoy). The younger sister, Briony (Saoirse Ronan), is an impressionable teen and budding writer. Cecilia's brother, Leon, arrives with a male friend, Paul, who takes keen interest in some children staying at the home. One evening, a passion erupts between Cecilia and Robbie that is interrupted by Briony. Later that night a girl is brutally assaulted by an unknown assailant. The subsequent allegations will have tragic consequences. The story shifts between London where Cecilia is a nurse and Dunkirk where Robbie fights to survive the early stages of World War II. The couple struggle to be reunited from afar even as a maturing Briony comes to terms with her past deeds. It is only later in life that she faces her guilt by paying tribute to the undying love of a tragic couple.Atonement sets out to be an ambitious undertaking of love corrupted by outside forces and those from within as it spans the decades. It shows how mere words can hurt in ways that cannot be imagined. In this, the plot is not dissimilar to The Children's Hour where a child's words hurt deeply. The story focuses less about the horror and effects of war, and more on the purging and cleansing of sins. Briony chooses to deal with her misrepresentations and redeems herself with a final act of poetic justice (think Titanic), even if it takes a lifetime. The film suffers a bit from confusing points of view as seen through the eyes of Briony by replaying the same scene to depict her point of view. What remains somewhat unclear are her motives. Is she jealous of the love between Cecilia and Robbie or is she making wild assumptions based on distortions?The acting is quite good with teen Saoirse Ronan a standout as Briony. In fact, all three actresses who play Briony at various stages of life are a splendid tandem (much like the tandems in Shine or TV's Life with Judy Garland). Almost functioning as a Greek tragedy, the film most people will compare this to is The English Patient, which is ironic because there is a scene that has a television interviewer played by Patient's director, Anthony Minghella! Atonement benefits from some good cinematography (Seamus McGarvey), which depicts some startling, surreal imagery especially in a tracking shot that says all that need be said of the horrifying evacuation of British troops at Dunkirk. The editing flashes back and forth to make a point or give background, and yet you wonder what is real or imagined. The musical score (Dano Marianelli) is in keeping with the dramatic mood quite nicely.By the finale, we get to have an ending of sorts. Is it reality or the fabrication of an author's guilt-ridden imagination? One thing is for sure: the feelings of longing and love are real. Atonement is like reading an epic romance novel with a bit of Jane Austen thrown in for good measure. As such, it's pretty compelling.",8,0,1,8 February 2008
The Island," The Island is a fun, summer flick
","Michael Bay has directed some big budget action adventures that have an over-the-top feel (like Pearl Harbor and Armageddon). He tones it down a bit and, despite borrowing from a myriad of past films, his latest effort, The Island, is an intelligent, entertaining adventure with science fiction as its source material.In the not too distant future, there is a segregated world of men and women who function with a limited view and knowledge of their antiseptic world. Their only way of life is that they must work, follow the rules and dream of being selected in the lottery to go to The Island, the ultimate destination of happiness and fulfillment. One of the populace is a male, Lincoln Six Echo (Ewan McGregor), who begins to question his existence and role in the world even as he develops a friendship with a female, Jordan Two Delta (Scarlett Johansson). He also experiences nightmares about an outside world and expresses doubts about the validity of his surroundings including the lottery. He relates these concerns to a friendly doctor, Merrick (Sean Bean) and later to an outsider, McCord (Steve Buscemi), a computer geek. As he explores the floors above him, he stumbles onto another level where he discovers a terrible truth and lie. Realizing that their world is only part of something much more, Lincoln and Jordan make a break to the outside with McCord's help and find themselves pursued by bounty hunters led by Albert Laurent (Djimon Hounsou). It seems that Merrick works for a cloning corporation dependent on enormous outside funds, and it is involved in secretly cloning humans for individual sponsors. The problem is that the corporation has gone too far in its experiments with tragic consequences. Searching for answers, Lincoln and Jordan eventually find themselves face to face with Lincoln's sponsor whereupon they decide to stop Merrick's evil plans and expose his horrifying activities to the world even as Laurent closes in. This film is engaging from the very start with its interesting premise, and it does a good job of maintaining a steadily building mystery until the startling revelation which spins our protagonists in another direction. And if it seems the storyline is derivative of a multitude of other film plot lines, it's because concepts such as duplicate humans, memory loss, corporate societies, and the pursuit of individual freedom and identity in a futuristic setting have been visited before. There are strong echoes of Coma, Logan's Run, Minority Report, Total Recall, and especially George Lucas' early THX 1138 and John Frankenheimer's Seconds. And savvy viewers may recall an older made-for-television movie along the same lines called The Resurrection of Zachary Wheeler. Yet by liberally borrowing from these stories, The Island reinterprets familiar themes into a reasonably entertaining story unto its own with a nod to science fiction author Philip Dick. Adapted from his own story by Caspian Tredwell-Owen and Alias alums Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman, the narrative takes a deliberate path, and its exciting action scenes, particularly the numerous chases on foot and by car, are in service of the plot. Michael Bay has been notorious for filming elaborate, 'shoot 'em up' and 'blow 'em up' set pieces that resemble a massive video game. Here, he holds back a little and concentrates more on staying true to his storyline. 'The play's the thing' and events move so rapidly, you don't notice the credibility gaps that strain logic at times. Sean Bean (who is making himself quite the first choice in movie villainy as in Goldeneye) is quite good as the sinister Merrick, and Djimon Hounsou (Gladiator) registers in a role that could have been one dimensional and without heart. Ethan Phillips (late of Star Trek: Voyager) lends able support as a resident of the clone world. And let us not forget the wonderful Steve Buscemi (Reservoir Dogs) who gets some of the best lines and exits much too soon. The leads, McGregor (Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith) and Johansson (Lost in Translation) are quite photogenic and work together quite well. One wishes they have future screen pairings. The special effects are effective and especially impressive when Lincoln meets his dead on double. Those scenes are so good, they are seamless. The world of the near future is realistic in its depiction in much the way Blade Runner integrated futuristic vehicles and technology with older, existing buildings and settings. The pace is well edited, and the film never feels slow and boring.Again, there are a couple of scenes which really strain credulity, but they come and go so quickly that you are on to the next scene. One obvious complaint is the product placement that becomes a bit self conscious and annoying after the third or fourth product logo is conspicuously shown. You'll see what I mean. It's also hard not to have a slight feeling that the film's main theme has controversial, political implications with the debate over cloning, stem cell research and the abortion fight in recent headlines.Although it is ironically a clone of other film plots, The Island delivers legitimate action and thrills without sacrificing its linear storytelling. Let yourself go and don't pay too much attention to the occasional plot lapses, and you'll find this a reasonably diverting adventure.",7,63,114,15 July 2005
