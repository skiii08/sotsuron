Blade Runner 2049," Wait, what?
","I sat in the movie and thought of giving it 8 points. But then the movie ended and I wondered who would answer all those questions I still had.So either the movie didn't make sense, it didn't explain enough or I wasn't attentive enough â€“ I surely don't have the time to watch the movie over and find out.I had a similar feeling after the first part of Blade Runner but expected this to be a bit more clear as nowadays movies seem to be better structured (well, almost all).",6,2,7,7 October 2017
