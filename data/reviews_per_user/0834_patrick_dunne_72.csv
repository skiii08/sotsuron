Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Kill Bill Volume Two redeems itself a little bit from the flaws of the first volume, but carries flaws of its own
","I hated Kill Bill Volume One. No, I have not seen all of it, but of what I have seen: I thought it was terrible. For example, half the film was style and violence, and the 'Bang! Bang!' song seemed to set it up as a drama. (These were only a few flaws.) Luckily, the Kill Bill series was able to redeem itself with Kill Bill Volume Two. The nameless Bride starts out in a scene talking about her attack, in a scene that seems too much to be like a Mystery Science Theatre Movie. After that long scene is done, we are introduced to Bill and Budd. Budd agrees to help Bill kill The Bride and return the sell the so-called priceless sword. But, to kill Bill, The Bride goes to a Shoaling Temple to learn the deadly 'Five Point Palm-Exploding Heart Technique.' Kill Bill Volume Two improves on two of the main flaws of the first one. The first film was 100% violence, and the only thing besides that was a whole lot of incoherence. Kill Bill Volume Two has hardly any violence. It has more story than the original. This is an improvement. The second flaw was that the 'Bang! Bang!' song in the beginning seems to set Kill Bill Volume One up as a drama. Volume Two is more of a drama, and the ending is fairly touching.However, even if Volume Two improves on the first one, it creates some flaws of its own. First of all, the whole film is over-drawn. It seemed like Tarintino was trying to put a short script into 136 minutes, which makes the film pretty boring at times. Bill's 'superhero speech,' the goldfish speech, the introduction of the 'Two Chapels Massacre,' the fight between Elle and The Bride, and the whole thing about Budd's job all had one thing in common: They were hideously over-drawn. The second flaw was that the film seemed to try to be a kung-fu movie. I heard it was Tarintino's style to copy 'B movies,' but nobody wants to watch a modern-day cheesy flick. Some things that made Kill Bill Volume Two look like a corny 'B movie' were: the sudden zooms on the camera, the times the sensei flips his beard, and the colorful background with black figures. I recall somebody saying 'They must have felt so goofy working for Quentin Tarintino.' Kill Bill Volume Two is an improvement, but it still has flaws of its own. If you hated the first like me, than you might want to pick this one up, unless you think you will hate it equally as much.6/10 Good: Drama and Action Bad: Over-drawn, corny B-movie style and carries some of the flaws of the first volumeFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",6,0,2,2 January 2006
Vertigo," Ver-ti-go: 1) The sensation of dizziness. 2) A confused state of mind. 3) A great and smart thriller by Alfred Hitchcock
","Alfred Hitchcock may have been one of the most famous and influential directors that ever lived. Sure, he was limited to suspense films, but nobody-and I mean nobody could make more suspenseful films than Hitchcock. Vertigo is no exception.The great, yet strange storyline will leave you on the edge of your seat, as the detective Scottie follows around a woman who is perhaps possessed by the ghost of Carlotta Varde. Seemingly paranormal things happen, and the storyline is far from predictable. It takes twists and turns, and will leave you guessing and wanting more. You will wonder about the actions, and you will ask yourself 'What will happen next?' When you finally guess, you will find your self surprised, shocked, but satisfied with the outcome.It's fairly realistic too. It takes place in San Francisco, and you will be astounded be all the familiar sights. Then again, there isn't one thing that isn't astounding about Vertigo.This movie makes a smart and fun thriller. Every minute is something fresh and new to satisfy your craving. It's one of my favorite movies. Nothing will make you hold your breath, or excite and bewilder you like Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. Nothing.10/10",10,7,10,23 October 2005
Walk the Line," Perhaps not totally emotional, but well-driven by great performances
","Perhaps similar to 'Ray,' 'Walk the Line' is a documentary on Johnny Cash, a country singer played by Joaquin Phoenix.After a brief clip of Johnny's childhood, the main story starts off when he comes out with his record 'Cry, Cry, Cry.' So, he goes on tour with June Carter, (Reese Witherspoon) trying to make himself a country singer. He meets his partner, June and they become friends. But, Johnny wants to become more than just that. He does have a wife, but they aren't too close. 'Walk the Line' is a story about character development and heart.I believe the title 'Walk the Line' either stands for one of Johnny's songs or walking the DUI line. (A test to make sure you aren't drunk.) If it's the second one, then it probably because Johnny gets drunk at one point. You see, Johnny had a rough life. His brother died, and his dad blamed it on Johnny. From there on, Johnny takes anger pills for those rough times. He also makes plenty of mistakes when trying to get June Carter to fall in love with him.'Walk the Line' has a lot of country music. Reese Witherspoon is probably the best singer out of all of them, because of the neat tricks she can do with her voice. It also features plenty of Johnny Cash songs including 'Rock n' Roll Groupie' and 'Ring of Fire.' Joaquin sings them with a deep voice and all his songs sound good. My favorite songs would have to be 'Get Rhythm (When you get the Blues)' and 'Time's a Wastin''. Of course, if you dislike country music, you probably shouldn't see it.I found 'Walk the Line' to be a little short in the storyline department. It has plenty of music, but the music takes up time for a story. It's simple. There are no major twists or turns. But, 'Walk the Line' is about character development; not story.That's where the drama comes from. It's about how characters change and feel. If the emotion came from the dialogue, it would probably fail emotionally. I thought more heart could have been put into the dialogue. But, with pretty deep characters and great performances, (Reese won an Oscar for giving enough sass to June, and for excellent vocals.) 'Walk the Line' succeeds, even if there are few scenes of powerful emotion. I wouldn't call it amazing, as so many have, but it's powerful at various points in the movie.Overall, 'Walk the Line' may be a little short, but it's entertaining and occasionally powerful.7/10 Good: Music and acting Bad: A bit lacking in substance and dialogueFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7,0,0,12 March 2006
50 First Dates," Better than most Adam Sandler and Rob Schnieder Comedies
","Billy Madison, Mr. Deeds, The Waterboy, Eight Crazy Nights, The Hot Chick, Surf Ninja: Adam Sandler and Rob Schnieder have been together in a lot of comedies...and in a lot of bad ones too. Even if they were going solo, they still did pretty bad. I remember many of their comedies on 'metacritic.com''s bottom 200 list.Now they team up again for '50 First Dates.' Adam Sandler and Rob Schneider fans were most likely excited, while their haters had low expectations. The Adam/Rob fans most likely loved it, and the Adam/Rob haters most likely got better than they expected.'50 First Dates' is about a guy named Henry (played by Adam Sandler) who falls in love with a woman (Lucy) with short-term memory loss that lasts about 24 hours. Henry tries to find a way to make Lucy remember him.The ending is perhaps the sweetest and most romantic moment of the all. Perhaps it can only stand in the shadows of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,' but it's a funny and sweet romantic comedy. It's not as confusing as 'Eternal Sunshine,' which means it's good for light, relaxed entertainment.The film is funny and sweet. It doesn't make as many gross and bad jokes as other Adam Sandler comedies. Sure, there are a few bad ones (Such as the person who can't be defined as a man or a woman. Too gross.)but they are quickly revived by some actually good jokes. I liked the scene where Lucy beat up Rob.And, who is Rob? Well, he plays Henry's Hawaiin friend with a weird eye (I think it's glass.) named Ula.If you thought Adam and Rob were out of the comedy business, than you should probably see this. It's not 'amazing,' but a romantic comedy with heart; and that should be enough.Good: Funny and romantic. It redeems Adam and Rob.Bad: Oftentimes too gross, and is forgettable, with or without Lucy's memory loss.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Null,0,1,2 February 2006
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," 'E.T. Phone Home'
","'E.T. phone home.' 'E.T. the Extraterrestrial' is about an alien stranded on earth, and is found by a little boy. Of course, he wants to 'phone home' so he can go back.E.T. shows the classic emotion of love, loss and separation. While this is all very good, it seems like it only fulfills half of what I expected.It starts off when an alien ship lands on Earth, and leaves a passenger behind. This alien is found by Elliot, a young boy. They form a bond, and become unusually connected.'E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial' shows the classic emotions of love, friendship and the heart-shattering death and separation. Sound a bit complex for a family film, doesn't it? Well, it's really not all that. The emotions seem to be simplified, without enough depth to affect the viewer. To me, it felt as if they were merely introduced.The story seems predictable. I think it's been told before with dogs. (I believe it happened in White Fang.) The only real difference between the dog stories and E.T. is that E.T. is on a much bigger scale. I mean, you've never seen dogs build such machines, have you? Yet, E.T. still seems to never fulfill what it seems to have promised. As I said before, the emotions aren't deep enough to let the viewer feel sorry or touched by the characters. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) The ending doesn't seem to be any surprise too. Films don't need surprise endings, but the ending in E.T. seems not at all emotional. The only thing that really helps the ending is a build-up of music. (END OF SPOILERS) One thing that made this film a disappointment washype. Yes, you've heard that word before, haven't you? I know that everybody thinks it isn't a good reason to dislike films, but many people are let down by a movie because of it. Let me explain -It was number 108 in Haiwell's top 1000 movies list.-It got **** out of **** by a critic who gave seemingly lower scores to Shawshank Redemption, American Beauty, Joy Luck Club and Million Dollar Baby.-It got 94 out of 100 on metacritic.com, which is enough to get it into the top 10. (I don't know why it isn't there.) - It was somewhere in 'Four Star Movies: The best 101 Movies Ever Made' and around the 80's if I remember correctly.It's pretty hard for a film to live up to all that.The final flaw is that E.T. seems so short! I believe it's around one hour and 55 minutes long, but it seems only like 80 minutes. Of course, children don't want to watch a movie with the length of films such as 'The Godfather' (even though adults will appreciate them) but the film never left me satisfied with a feeling of accomplishment.Overall, E.T. was a huge disappointment. It has emotion, but it doesn't appear to have enough of anything to make the emotion work. The 'touching' moments look almost too predictable, short and shallow to work. I know lots and lots of people will disagree with me, and I'm almost prepared to accept that.Note: 'The viewer' is referring to me.Good: Well, it will be emotional for some.Bad: The emotions don't seem to be very emotional. The film seems to have a very short running time. (Even though the box says that it goes on for over 100 minutes.) And, there's a hell of a lot of hype fir those who read the movie books a lot.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Null,0,1,29 January 2006
Mulan," How animated films should be
","I must say, Mulan is a truly wonderful film. It used to be one of my favorites as a kid.It deals with ancient China, where only men could join the army. To fight the invading Hans, the government recruits men to join the army to fight the invaders. This affects Mulan's small family. Mulan is reluctant to have her father fight in the war, because she knows he could easily die, so she steals his armor and sword and sets off to join the army as a man. She later gets a companion named Mushu (voices by Eddie Murphy) who is a miniature and funny dragon sent by the ancestors. And so our story begins.I really loved this movie. First of all, he story deals with a semi-sexist community, and one of the people who are considered lower, stands out from the rest. I found this to be very dramatic, and it reminds me of other movies, such as Rabbit-Proof Fence, where the despised half-castes run away from the cruel camp. This is a similar situation.Second of all, the film is very funny. Eddie Murphy shows off his comedic talents when playing the role of Mushu. It's rather silly at times, but it doesn't hurt to laugh. I thought one of the funniest scenes was the bath scene, but it was pretty gross though.Third of all, the animation is superbly detailed. The characters do look a bit funny, but the artists defiantly took their time in making this wonderful film.Mulan is very powerful, very detailed and very funny- just like all animated films should be. I don't know why this isn't in the top 50 animated films. It's wonderful.8.5/10",8,5,6,30 December 2005
Shaun of the Dead," Witty, funny, dramatic: Shaun of the Dead is very enjoyable and undoubtedly worth watching
","I saw this not to long ago, and I can safely say that it is not funny, but hilarious! Shaun of the Dead is an excellent parody of Dawn of the Dead and Night of the Living Dead. Shaun is your average British guy who lives with a friend that mooches off of him (Ed) and a girlfriend who just broke up with him (Liz) and a mom who has a very distant relationship with him. (Barbara) During one odd day, Shaun and Ed notice that the townspeople seem to be staggering and groaning. Weird. It becomes weirder when they start biting and even weirder when the news starts warning people to stay inside their houses, because the townspeople have turned into zombies.The film is well-known for being funny. Apparently, Shaun's dry wit of the situation makes the viewers able to laugh. My friend and I had to re-play the scene where Shaun encounters a zombie and makes a bit of a song with him. It was that funny. The other scenes aren't as funny, but still worth a decent laugh. Shaun certainly provides the silliness needed to pull of big laughs. I also thought the sense of irony made it funny.David: (while Shaun is off fighting zombies) 'And what's Shaun's big plan? Sitting around in the dark eating peanuts?' Shaun: (perhaps ten minutes later) Would anybody like a peanut? Aside from that, the film is also a good horror and thriller. Yes, it is a comedy, but it isn't a comedy so silly that it messes up the story line, just to get a decent laugh. The story is the same as Night of the Living Dead, except perhaps a bit sillier. Who says parodies can't be thrilling? I also thought it could qualify as a drama. Various scenes of death and revealed secrets make it fairly emotional. Zombies eating and killing everybody doesn't exactly make you feel good. The characters slightly fall apart, as emotions take over logic, which causes the characters to need to pull together and fight harder in the situation.There were two main flaws in the movie. The first is that it may be WAY too gory for some people. Yes, it is a zombie movie, but is viewing somebody's insides fully necessary? The second one is that the film lessens as a comedy and becomes more of a drama during the part when the group enters the pub. It takes away some of the light-hearted tone, and takes a more serious tone. I do like drama, but that was kind of disappointing for me, because I really loved the witty comedic moments Shaun of the Dead had to offer.None of the jokes are over-drawn or too stupid to prevent a laugh. They come by the minute, each one funnier then the next. It really made my day.8.5/10 Good: Funny, light-hearted, witty, and makes a decent horror, thriller and comedy Bad: It's pretty gory, and seems to put an emphasis on horror and drama halfway through the film, which decreases it's comedic level.",8,2,5,2 January 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Fun, but not much of anything new
","Elizabeth Swan is captured by the pirates of the Black Pearl. Captain Jack Sparrow and Will Turner go out to save her.As you can see, the storyline is nothing new. To add to that, Pirates of the Caribbean had no inspiration, except for a Disney ride, so you can't expect anything extraordinary. The movie, however, does offer some pirate sword-fighting, adventure, and funny lines to make up for that. However, the adventure isn't enough to hold the weights of a close-to-two-hour-experience. The movie is fun, but forgettable to some people, and drags on too much for more people. (like me)6.5/10",6,1,2,20 October 2005
"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Narnia packs us with all the characters of Harry Potter, and all the style of Lord of the Rings, but most of all-it's great fun for Christmas
","--Only tiny spoilers through-out-- Yes, this is it! The Chronicles of Narnia is the next big fantasy hit, along with Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter. It is not only up there with them, but packs all the characters of Harry Potter and all the style of Lord of the Rings.I will start from the beginning. In the first scene, an English family is being bombed by Nazi planes. So, the family runs off, and the children are sent away on a train to go live with 'The Professor.' (I guess it is no coincidence that English children being sent away to live with relatives also happened in Harry Potter.) They think that it is going to be an exciting journey, but they were wrong. To entertain themselves, the four children play hide-and-seek. While trying to find a hiding spot, Lucy (one of the children) stumbles upon a covered wardrobe. Of course, we all know what this means. After seeing it happen before in many other stories and movies, we know that Lucy found a portal to another world. There, she meets Mr. Tumnus, a cheerful fantasy creature who actually plans to kidnap her. (I remember somebody like that in Harry Potter.) Of course, more adventures happen, and when the children finally all gather into Narnia (this scene does take a while to get to) they go on different adventures and meet different characters, such as talking animals (just like the talking books in Harry Potter) and even, (just in time) Santa Clause! (Keep in mind that Santa gives away weapons in this film.) Okay, so far we have talked about the characters in Harry Potter. So, what about the style of Lord of the Rings? Well, the audience is treated to wonderful music (part of which creates the fantasy environment in Lord of the Rings) and some of the most wonderful detail. What am I talking about? I am talking about the amazing effects of the castle, the weapons, the creatures and the special effects. (especially when people turn to stone) Not to mention, the war scene isn't as breath-taking as the one in Lord of the Rings: Return of the King, but it sure comes close! Plus, the camera angles of the griffins dropping rocks on the army resemble that of Legolas killing the elephants. They both show lots of detail of the war beneath them.This was an excellent film! The world of Narnia is full of fun and creativity. It just didn't blow us away as much as Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings. Either way, it still ranks among them.8/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",8,0,0,11 December 2005
Madagascar," You seen one, and you've seen them all.
","You've probably seen many of DreamWorks films before, such as Shrek, Ice Age and Shark Tale. If you've seen those, than you have seen this. Even if you haven't watched it yet, you already have 'seen it.' Why? The answer is simple. Madagascar seems to be similar to just about every other DreamWorks film. I'll explain.The film starts out loud, lively and colorful. That is the beginning of nearly every DreamWorks film. Then, we are introduced to the characters: Marty, Alex, Melman and Gloria. Alex is a loud, obnoxious and self-centered lion, and that seems to resemble Donkey from Shrek. Melman is a giraffe who is sick, just about all the time. Gloria is a hippo who seems like the stereotype of a character that Whoopi Goldberg always plays. Lastly, Marty is a zebra who wishes of escaping.One day, something happens with the penguins trying to escape. Then, something else happens when the animals board a ship, and it crashes onto Madagascar. I think I forgot most of that segment, but whatever. Anyways, the four find themselves on an island with lemurs and other primates.So, back to what I was saying. It's a film that starts out lively and colorful. The characters have celebrity voice talents. The film is an adventure film. Near the middle, two of the characters don't trust each other. The ending is predictable. The film has many, many references to other movies.An adventure film with two characters who mistrust each other was an idea that has been used for Shrek, Ice Age and Shark Tale. (Except, Shark Tale isn't adventure.) So, Madagascar ends up looking like a forgettable DreamWorks film that was copied from the above three. Plus the moment of drama was used many times before this in other computer animated films, including 'Toy Story.'Also, the jokes simply aren't too funny. Well, the film does have a couple decent laughs, but not too many to redeem itself.6/10 Good: Lively and (oftentimes) funny due to the animation and voices Bad: Seems to be ripped-off of other DreamWorks filmsFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",6,1,2,20 January 2006
Spider-Man 2," A superior superhero flick
","Being a superhero was never easy. I suppose Sam Raimi liked melancholy movies, ever since he made A Simple Plan. Melancholy, or sadness, was the main point of the movie. 'It's the superhero movie for people who don't go to superhero movies,' Roger Ebert says.There is a bit of a melancholy element behind the sequel to the Spider-man. Peter Parker faces numerous personal problems, which bring down his self-esteem and bring in a whole lot of dialogue. (Which I didn't think was corny!) First of all, there is Harry. If you can re-call the first movie, Harry is still upset about the death of daddy. He knows Spider-man is connected to it, but doesn't know that Peter is Spider-man. Now, he wishes to take revenge on Peter Parker a.k.a Spider-man. So much for being a best friend! Next in line, is Mary Jane. Apparently being a superhero isn't all it's cracked up to be. There seems to be so much trouble, Peter can never arrive in time for his appointments. Sadly, one of them is Mary's play, which Peter has promised to see, but can never make it! And to think that Peter and Mary Jane almost had a relationship. Too bad she's getting married to somebody else.Every superhero needs a villain, and Doctor Octopus is the one for Peter. After his experiment goes wrong, he accidentally fuses four metal tentacles onto his back. Now, crazed to finish his failed experiment, he puts the city in danger. Poor Peter. Only superheroes can stop the super villains. Now he must defeat Doc Ock. Add that to the 'to do' list.What more can we pile on?!?! Sadly, Peter there's much more. His grandma doesn't trust him, his grades are dropping, he can't even pay the rent and his stress even results in drastic consequences. Wow, after saving the lives of all those innocent people, so much bad happens to him! I wonder if karma does actually exist. Well, at least not in movies.Spider-man 2 is a definite improvement on the first. Sam combines drama with action sequences to help the those with short attention spans.I hope Raimi has a lot more in store for us, because this is solid proof that sequels can live up to, or even surpass the originals. I just wish the film wasn't so darn predictable!8/10",9,1,2,21 October 2005
Finding Nemo," A Wild and Colorful Ride
","It's always a pleasure to see Pixar come out with another movie. Pixar has the power to make you laugh, and make you smile. When you walk out of the theater, you can show off that big grin crowding your face.Okay. Well enough of the corny-ness. Finding Nemo is a good, fun movie. It is a movie about a fish named Marlin, who is trying to find his little son in a big ocean.While it is a good movie, I found it to be over-hyped and disappointing. With most of the Pixar and Dreamworks movies working more in the comedy department, we would expect Pixar to go in a more comedic direction. But, Finding Nemo wasn't the laugh-fest I expected it to be. Sorry about my bias, but I was pretty disappointed! I also thought certain lines such as 'That snail was about to charge' were a bit corny. That upset me a bit too. Besides, the plot is a bit similar to Toy Story. A character gets lost, and somebody goes out to rescue him. But, that's just my opinion.7/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7,0,2,19 January 2006
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," Surprisingly Funny
","I can't believe it. This movie was better than I expected! I originally called it 'How to Lose Interest in a Movie in Ten Seconds' which was taken from another review, but I actually enjoyed it. I thought it was a very funny movie.The story line is this: Andy Anderson has to right an article for her magazine. She wants to tell the world about what NOT to do when dating a guy. So, when she dates this man, she will keep a diary, and count down the days until the guy splits. What's next is that Benjamin, a guy working for some diamond company, made a bet: he can run the company if he dates a girl for ten days. (He claims he is a lady's man.) So, Andy and Benjamin meet each other, and decide to go out with each other. And so it begins.Sure, the story line was predictable, but the movie was funny! Even if it was a bit gross at time, I still enjoyed it! The funniest part was the psychologist joke at the ending. Some of the humor was a bit gross though. But, overall, I enjoyed this movie more than I originally expected to. I can only hope you would enjoy it too.Good: It's funny!

Dead Poets Society," Dead Poets Society is a drama that has potential, but seems to concentrate a little too much on poetry
","I never really liked poetry. It was fun, but nothing to get excited about. So, it's not very surprising that I wouldn't like a movie about poetry.Don't get me wrong. Dead Poets Society had potential. It's just that the film was too boring. Don't get me wrong on that either, I love dramas. If they're boring, then usually they need a second viewing to get all the information. However, Dead Poet Society was all about poetry. Once again, I just never found it to be very interesting. All the drama is unevenly spread, keeping it all at the last 30 minutes.If you fell asleep during English class, then I doubt I will have to say what will happen here. Dead Poets Society is not a bad movie, but it's not too good either. Or, maybe, as previously stated, I need to watch it again.7/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Null,0,1,22 October 2005
Chicken Run," Fun, fun and more fun in Chicken Run
","If Nick Park knew how to do anything, it was to create a fun family film with funny characters and jokes all around. After all, he is the creator of Wallace and Gromit.Chicken Run (2004) is Nick Park's latest achievement, and a parody of The Great Escape. It centers on a group of chickens lead by Ginger, who are forced to lay a certain amount of eggs every week, so the farmers may sell them. If they don't fill the quota, they become dinner for the two farmers who own the land and the chickens. When the farmers get a new idea, and decide to speed up business by making chicken pie. Of course, this means that chickens go into the machine, and pies come out. This also means bad news for the chickens. Since Ginger thinks of escaping 24/7, all the other chickens depend on her for a plan. But, since all her plans have failed so far, the chickens are near doomed. Or, it seems that way, until a rooster named Rocky comes 'flying' into town. Rocky tries to teach the chickens how to fly, and escape from the farm- that is, if he can fly.The funny characters with a wonderful cast help and the same wonderful stop-motion animation in Wallace and Gromit are the elements that bring Chicken Run to life. They are used to express funny jokes, that won't exactly leave you howling with laughter, but will manage to exert a chuckle. No, it isn't as funny as we'd like it to be, but some jokes don't hurt anybody, do they? Overall, Chicken Run would most likely be described as 'lovable' and 'delightful' only because those adjectives are true. What can I say? It's just fun! But, I didn't think it lived up to Nick Park's other creation: Wallace and Gromit.Good: Fun, lovable, funny, good animation Bad: I thought it was a bit disappointing.7/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7,1,1,19 December 2005
Home Alone," Recommended for the holidays
","Holidays are all about cheer and joy. They are times to laugh and spend with your family. Home Alone achieves cheer, joy, laughter, except for family.Home Alone (written by John Hughes, who also did the funny Breakfast Club) is about an 8-year old boy named Kevin who is accidentally left at home when his parents leave for Christmas vacation. Unfortunately for Kevin, he lives in a rich house, which is targeted by two burglars: Marv and Harry. They plan to rob Kevin's house at 9:00 pm, so Kevin has to protect himself, using self-invented traps.Home Alone is simply full of slapstick humor, with some hidden jokes in between. (One of the funniest parts is the one with the pizza man.) But, John Hughes made one mistake: He forgot to make it realistic. How could Kevin stay asleep, while his whole family is screaming and trying to pack? How could he make so many traps, but not pack a suitcase? How could Marv spend so much time on the floor after tripping, when Harry has grabbed Kevin? How? Well, despite the main flaw, Home Alone makes a fun, heart-warming holiday movie. I would definitely recommend it! Of course, it isn't perfect, but its fun and fun is what holiday movies should be! 7/10 Good: Fun, funny and heart-warming, and has nothing to do with Santa (like most Christmas movies do)Bad: Unrealistic, and it could be funnierFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",6,0,1,22 December 2005
Nacho Libre," It's OK
","I don't feel as if I have much time to write this review, so I will keep it short. 'Nacho Libre' is a film about an orphan who dreams of being rich, and becoming a Luchador, which is a type of Mexican Wrestler. He enters a contest, and wins money, even when he loses. He befriends a thief-type person (A character similar to Aladdin. That's the best way I can describe it.) who becomes his tag-team partner in wrestling.The film has a few puns here and there. Most are somewhat funny, perhaps able to exert a chuckle, but the farting jokes are downright annoying. Jack Black doesn't do such a good job playing a Spanish orphan, because his accent gets annoying.The film is quite silly, but the storyline, and the bad accent of Jack Black, brings it down to somewhat embarrassing. The storyline never seems to make much sense. For a period of the time, Jack Black wrestles without a mask, which is (I think) required. There seems to be no tag-team, and rather two people fighting in the ring at once instead of switching off.Overall, the whole film is cliché some of the time, and has not enough good puns to keep you entertained for the entire running time.

","'Corpse Bride' is a film by Tim Burton, who made most of his fans by impressing them with 'Nightmare before Christmas.' So, to put some extra cash in his pocket, he came out with 'The Corpse Bride.' Like most Burton films, 'Corpse Bride' stars Johnny Depp. This time, he plays Victor, a soon-to-be husband of Victoria. Of course, he comes from a rich family, and the parents are making him marry for money. However, he can't quite master the wedding ritual. Instead of simply saying 'I do' the ritual is long and quite difficult to remember. Anyways, while Victor is practicing the ritual in the woods, he slips the ring onto what he thinks is a stick, but it's actuallythe corpse bride! So, they get married, and Victor tries to find a way out of it.This film was a lot like Burton's previous work 'Nightmare before Christmas.' Here are some similarities: <ul><li>The main character is male and regrets something. Jack ('Nightmare') is tired of celebrating Halloween over and over, while Victor is ashamed he can't do the wedding properly.</li></ul><ul><li>Both main characters have a pet dog that happens to be dead.</li></ul>-Both are in love with/going to be married to a disobedient daughter who often escapes out of her room.-The song with the spider and the worm sounded very similar to one of the 'Nightmare before Christmas' songs.-Both have dead people, clay animation and music.The visual and sound is stunning. The stop-motion animation was excellently used, and one of the best parts of the movie. The living and dead are almost vice-versa, because the living world is boring and the dead world is colorful. The sound is excellent. The songs are reduced to about three, but they sound pretty good.But, that's the flaw. The main reason I enjoyed 'Nightmare' was the music. I remember singing some of the songs by the time the film was over. This one had about three songs, and was lacking any background music when needed. Remember that this was supposed to appeal to 'Nightmare before Christmas' fans? Well, I don't know why people would like it as much if it had no music.Music is what brought the dead to life, and what made the film fun. 'Corpse Bride' looks slow and short, and tries to fill in the little story it has into 80 minutes. It started in the boring living world and never seemed to get away from it.Good: Visuals, some good songs (even if there are only a few), funny at timesBad: Only a few good songs, seemed boring, similar to 'Nightmare before Christmas'Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Null,2,4,17 February 2006
Forrest Gump," Forrest Gump is one beautiful tale that is not to be missed.
","A mentally-challenged man is telling his life to random people on a bench. Good idea? Sure, it doesn't sound too promising, but trust me-it is! The film starts out with Tom Hank's wonderful performance of Forrest Gump. He sits on a bench telling his about his life to people that will listen. What exactly is his life? Forrest has lived a dramatic, passionate life full of love, romance and laughs.Forrest Gump plays out in chronological order. We start out in his childhood, which Forrest lives through without a father. When he goes to school, he meets Jenny, the girl he is destined to fall in love with. The childhood is a bit embarrassing- the kids are all very odd, but luckily, that is soon over when Forrest goes to high school. He is picked on for his low IQ, and only Jenny sticks up for him. When the kids throw rocks at him, he runs. And thus, one of the most famous lines in Cinema History: 'Run Forrest, run!' So, Forrest lives through life, often meeting historical figures, which are seen through Forrest's eyes. (The tag line is 'Your world will never be the same, once you've looked through the eyes of Forrest Gump.') Meanwhile, Jenny goes in her own direction, having boyfriends, becoming a hippie, prostituting, and much more.Through the thirty years Forrest lives, only a few moments are spent with Jenny. Because of this, those moments are the sweetest moments of them all. Well, they might be. There are so many moments; it's hard to pinpoint just one.I know this film has some flaws such as some gross jokes, and embarrassing moments. I cannot deny these flaws, but I also cannot deny the warmth that was in my heart after the movie was over. The acting, witty humor, drama, creativity and romance will do noting less than put a smile on your face.10/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",9,1,2,10 November 2005
"Monsters, Inc."," Delightful fun by Peter Doctor
","Toy Story was one of Pixar's greatest films. It was very enjoyable, though not as funny as the other Pixar movies, it was better. Toy Story was written by a man named Peter Doctor. After Toy Story 2, what do you think that Peter could come up with next? Monsters Incorperated, was the next great film to come from the script of Peter Doctor and the studio of Pixar. Though Toy Story mas have been hard to even come close to, Monsters Inc may be even better than Toy Story, which most other Pixar films can't top. This is truly one of the best Pixar films I have seen.With funny characters, a unique storyline and a unique setting along with clever jokes and laughs added into the mix, I believe that Monsters Inc. is one the best by Pixar.8/10",8,0,1,20 October 2005
Fargo," Works as both a thriller and a comedy
","---Spoilers--- The Coen Brothers are famous for many comedies and other types of movies such as 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?', 'Blood Simple,' and 'The Big Lebowski.' Their most famous one is 'Fargo.' 'Fargo' is their thriller and dark comedy that takes place in a small town. The story line is about a man named Jerry who lives in a small town and tries to get his wife's money by hiring two criminals.I didn't understand 'Fargo.' There were many moments or confusion or vagueness, like all the attacks on one of the criminals. Perhaps this was a technique to build up suspense. Or, it could have just assumed that the audience would be able to understand it. Either way, it seemed unclear to me.Yet, even if it's a confusing thriller/black comedy, it succeeds in both.I heard that a good thriller needs twists. Well, 'Fargo' is full of them. It's full of violence, and uses the violence to further the thrills. It also uses the shocking twists to make the audience jump. For example, when Jerry gets the phone call from Carl, it sends a chill through the audience's spine. There are also the psychological moments, where the audience is kept at the edge of their seat by asking 'What's going to happen next?' Take the part with the car lot. The audience knows that Jerry is lying, and we also know that Marge doesn't. So what's going to happen next? Is she going to find out? Is she going to get shot? Is she going to leave? It also works as a comedy. I think it's because of the funny accents (Darn Tootin') but it sure works! I found 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' funny, and 'Fargo' seems too also work as a comedy. Just remember that one scene: 'What does he look like?' 'Oh, kind of funny looking.' 'How so?' 'Oh, in a general kind of way.' It's funny...isn't it?Overall, I hardly understood 'Fargo,' but if you want a thriller that has millions of twists, this one is for youif you could understand it.Good: Entertaining, thrilling, funny and millions of plot twists Bad: It was kind of hard to understand.",8,0,0,1 February 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The budget is used well here, but the length of the film may not be suitable for you, but the film is great nonetheless
","J.R.R. Tolkein has made one of the most famous and memorable trilogies to date. The Lord of the Rings trilogy could perhaps find its place next to the Star Wars movies.The story centers around a hobbit named Frodo. (Hobbits are little dwarfish creatures with hairy feet.) His father happened to have stumbled upon a magic ring, one that will turn you invisible. (He is considered the 'least likely of all creatures to have something like that happen to him.) When an old friend, a wizard named Gandalf, comes strolling into town, he tells Frodo that the ring is bringing great evil. The hobbit and his companions set out on an adventure to drop the magical ring into the fires of Mt. Doom.Frodo, Sam, Mary, Pippin, Legolas, Boromir, and other numerous characters that you may have difficulty remembering travel with each other fighting trolls, orcs, goblins, and all those other fantasy baddies you can name. The numerous action scenes are quite fun. Although, they may not be as thrilling or stylish as others, they will still manage to entertain.One reason this movie succeeds are the characters. It is perhaps a bit more than a sword and sorcery epic. One of the things that will get your attention is the friendship between Sam and Frodo. A bit of emotion never hurts anybody, and the emotion in this film is good. At the end there is a partially touching scene.But, what really brings the Lord of the Rings to life is the beautiful environment. The budget was obviously used well here, because the environment will take your breath away. The colors match the characters. Frodo and Sam seem to have grayish-greenish suits, while Gandalf has white robes. The forests are lush and beautiful. The sounds match perfectly with the settings, and the voice match perfectly to the characters. Your senses will be treated well throughout this entire film.However, the movie seems to be over 3 hours long! If the movie can keep your attention, and the environment can work its magic long enough, then it would be worth it. If not, then you be asking why it is taking so long to move onto the next scene. Unfortunately for me, it didn't do a very good job of holding my attention span.8/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",8,0,0,13 November 2005
The Thing," Good horror, but flawed. Others may have appreciated the film more, but those are not me. Recommended to fans of thriller, horror and gore movies
","It all seemed like a normal summer in the Antarctic Mountains, when all of a sudden; a strange man appears in a helicopter, trying to shoot down a dog with a machine gun. The scientists spending their time at the houses in the Antarctic shoot the offender. But, why was he shooting at the dog? Well, apparently some creature was unearthed from the ice (or something like that) and came to terrorize the humans. This is no ordinary creature though. It can change its shape into the victims that it has killed. (Does that make sense?) If it kills somebody, it can look like them, and possibly speak like them! It sounds pretty similar to the villain in Terminator 2: Judgment Day! Well, if you have heard of the monster, than it becomes way too obvious about why the man was shooting at the dog. But, don't worry. To counter the predictability of the first scene, 'John Carpenter's The Thing' brings many moments that are, well not as predictable. These are the good moments. These are also the moments when the audience suspects that one of the people was infected by the creature, and therefore, the audience is subjected to guessing who it is.While the film is fairly un-predictable, these moments have their flaws. The audience is left guessing whether the person is Childs, Blaire, Clark or somebody else. This would be nice if we actually knew who they were! The characters hardly stand out from one another, and there are just way too many of them! How is the audience supposed to follow? This leads to confusion, which also makes the film less enjoyable to me. Plus, every moment of thrill is way too short for my enjoyment. This adds to the displeasure as confusion and boredom invade my enjoyment.But, the moments of thrill, while short, are fun. No, they're not so thrilling that you hold you're breath and refuse to stop watching, but they are pretty fun. After all, it is directed by John Carpenter, who made Halloween and The Fog. If you are a hardcore fan of thriller and horror films, or a hardcore fan of gore films, you should probably pick this one up.7/10 Good: Thrilling movie, with nice twists here and there.Bad: Confusion, boredom, short thrills and way too many characters",7,0,2,3 January 2006
The Village," Hey, I thought it was pretty good.
","The Village isn't a very scary film, but it's not supposed to be. It's a pretty good drama in my opinion. The characters are diverse, and the movie is fairly touching. Well, it is dramatic. I thought it was suspenseful too. (Just a little bit.) Hardcore horror fans won't like it though. For the rest of us, it is a beautiful film. The village itself is very good too. It shows the struggle of a small town and creatures that invade it. The film has wonderful style, and costumes, and you can really get the feel of an old village with the dialog and the costumes.As for the 'plot twist' at the end, it is just too make the film more realistic. (I think it is, anyways. I'm not so sure.) So, The Village has more to it that most people realize. It has acting, story, plot twists, costumes, drama and depth.7/10",7,0,2,25 November 2005
"I, Robot"," Not exactly 'The Terminator' but fun and well-done
","'I, Robot' is an adrenaline-pumped sci-fi action-thriller, with a sense of mystery to it. Sure, that has become a bit of a cliché, but who cares? Other ones such as The Terminator, The Matrix and Dark City have become widely popular.The story line is this: Will Smith plays Detective Spooner, and believes that the robots that people use to run everyday life are up to no good, due to some incident in his past. Of course, just about everybody disagrees with him, so he is all alone with his theory. After a robot is accused of murder, Detective Spooner goes all over the case. The story line unfolds well, and the action scenes are awesome and well-done. The movie is creative and fun, but casting Will Smith as the main character reminds me of so many bad movies, where pop stars are cast as the main character, just how Hilary Duff starring in a movie will undeniably remind me of some horrible chick flick. But, even if Will Smith wasn't the greatest choice, and some moments were pretty dull, the film's action, and story line make it well worth watching.7/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7,0,0,23 December 2005
American Beauty," Tradegy and Beauty mixed into one great piece of art
","American Beauty. These words symbolize the movie. It is about an American who finds divine beauty in his life and the world.The story starts off with Lester Birmingham narrating his pathetic life. The audience immediately fins out that he is a loser. (He even admits it.) Lester may cause the audience to feel embarrassed about watching it, during the first few minutes. He has to be one of the worst parents out there. He appears absolutely pathetic when he falls in love with his daughter's friend.So, here we have a pathetic excuse for a father, who is in love with a girl at least 10 years younger than him. His life becomes even worse when he loses his job, and his wife pretty much leaves him. So, Lester kind of turns his life around when he is introduced to Ricky Fits. Ricky sells him drugs, and teaches him how to govern his own life.The real drama starts when Lester's life affects everybody else. At this point, the film is no longer about Lester, but about the people in his life, and what is happening to them. Everybody becomes depressed, but they all find out how beautiful life can really be. This section of the film is probably the most dramatic, and the most moving.The characters are realistic, (except for Ricky) and the film seems to be almost poetic. It truly brings out the human emotions, and shows the good and ugly side of human nature. It shows the struggles, battles and insecurity taking place in all of our hearts. However, the film seems to be a bit too perverted for some. How many moments of nudity are there? More than enough. The message seems to be a bit unfitting for the film, too. Tragedy and beauty mix together, but not in a good way, during some scenes.I really enjoyed American Beauty, but I thought it could have been better.9/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",9,0,2,2 January 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," It TERMINATES all other sci-fi flicks. Use your JUDGEMENT and see it 2-DAY!!!!!
","Sorry about my corny joke, but I must say: This is a great film.I'm not sure what else to say. The storyline, acting, action, and special effects and everything else are great! Arnold Schwarzenegger plays The Terminator, a machine sent back in time to protect Edward Furlong, who plays John Connor, a 'bad boy' who is supposed to be the leader of the human race in a future war. The T-1000 is the villain in this movie. He is sent to kill John Connor. Obviously, he's not rooting for the home team.The T-1000 is an advanced Terminator. He can change shape and is made of liquid metal. That means if you shoot him, it will be like shooting water, except the water won't shoot you back. Plus, if he kills a person, he takes their shape. Isn't that like 'The Thing'? Gee, I wish we had technology like that.The movie is full of action scenes. There are lots of 'shoot-em-up' scenes and car chases. While most of it is those 'shoot-em-up' sequences, I prefer the elevator scene, where the T-1000 is attacking John Connor and his mom. (Great scene.) Terminator 2 may be one of the greatest sci-fi films I have ever seen. It's that good! I'm not sure how to describe it, but it's just fun! Solid action, solid acting, solid heroes, and a solid villain (although he is liquid), solid storyline, and mostly everything else makes up Terminator 2: Judgment day. It will not fail to entertain.8/10",8,1,2,10 November 2005
Being John Malkovich," Ever want to see something else? Now you can.
","A giant reptile eats random people, until somebody stops it. A hero fights their way through hordes of bad guys, until they get to the villain. Two people fall in love, but something prevents them from marrying. There is a damsel in distress, and a handsome prince rescues her. A person gets lost on in the forest, and has to survive, using the resources around him. Two people enter a house with a giant scary monster inside.Admit it, even some of the best movies have the most average story lines. Some movies have different plots, but they seem to be branched off another movie, or not very creative. When you need some new movie to keep you away from all the repeated story lines, what do you do? You see Being John Malcovich.Being John Malcovich is one of the most unusual, and unique movies you will ever see. Not only is it original, but it does include dark twists in the story, a constantly changing love triangle, mistakes that you will regret forever, and some really cool puppeteering.Craig Schwartz is an unemployed husband who claims 'Nobody's looking for a puppeteer in today's wintry economic climates.' So, he finds work as a filer. One day, Craig accidentally drops a folder behind a cabinet. He puts the cabinet aside, and finds something remarkable was hidden behind it-a portal into John Malcovich's head. When you go into it, you see what John sees, and feel what John feels. After the ride, you are dropped into a turnpike by the side of the road.Craig and his co-worker, Maxine, set up a business: pay $200 to be John Malcovich. This leads to some problems. The love triangles become complicated, and desire can make people do crazy things. When Lotte decides to become a transsexual, twists and turns appear throughout the film, and drama appears between the characters.Being John Malcovich isn't your average film- it's unique and much better! I don't usually like weird films, but Being John Malcovich spawned emotion! It was dramatic, how Craig was torn apart by the complicated love triangles! Besides, there is some humor too! I also thought it was good at being weird. It had normal characters in a not-so-normal setting. It isn't just another adventure story with some random things added into it. (With the exception of the 7 1/2 floor.) Craig enters the 7 1/2 floor with a 'What the heck is this?' kind of look on his face. The movie even seems to mock itself with the history of it. Being John Malcovich is for anybody who likes drama, strangeness, twisted romance, John Malcovich, himself, puppets, or just great movies.If you fall under any of those categories, (which I know you should) you better pick up the movie today.9/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",9,1,2,20 October 2005
Spider-Man," A very enjoyable, yet flawed movie
","Yes, another one. Spider-man stars Tobey McGuire as Peter Parker and is based on the comic book. Now, we have seen many comic book movies, but spider-man may be among more of the 'fun' comic book movies.Of course, we all know what happens in the beginning. Peter, a nerd in school who is in love with the popular girl, Mary Jane, transforms into a crime-fighting superhero. Despite the clichéd beginning, the movie gets better. After the introduction of the hero, a villain arises. The Green Goblin becomes the bad guy after a science experiment goes wrong. Yes, another cliché.Okay, so the story isn't perfect. It is full of clichés. But, it does have its high points. Despite the fact that it is a comic book movie, it manages to add a few dramatic moments. Obviously Sam Raimi didn't mind adding some heart. (Spoilers) The final fight between Spider-man and the Green Goblin is also very satisfying, and 'cool.' (End of Spoilers) But, to counter the positive side, the special effects are pretty bad and corny, and therefore the action isn't as good as we would like it to be. It's pretty hard to hide bad special effects like Jaws did, (even if it was a malfunction) when Spider-man doesn't have any water or anything to cover him.Another corny part was when Peter was trying to get Mary Jane to fall in love with him. He doesn't give a very good speech.Spider-man is a pretty bad flick, but if you turn your brain off, it's quite enjoyable. I mean, it's a whole lot better than all of those darn chick flicks where the un-poplar girls get the guy and triumph of the popular girls. I, and many more people, prefer the sequel. I will get a lot of disagreements on this, but the sequel hasn't totally ridden itself of clichés, but it has upped the special effects, drama and lowered the cheese factor.6/10 Good: Action, and many good scenes Bad: Corny special effects, speeches and clichéd story",6,2,4,20 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Harry Potter now has more storyline, mystery and entertainment- enough to fill your satisfaction
","Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is the one Harry Potter I remember.Harry once again takes the trip to Hogwarts, ready to go to school. But, things do not happen very smoothly. First of all, he learns that Sirius Black has escaped from Azkaban, and may be searching for Harry. Second of all, during the train ride to Hogwarts, Harry gets attacked by Dementors, which are creatures who know how to replicate your worst fears and memories.If anything, Harry Potter remains to be a fun movie, even if Harry's worst fear is fear itself, is unrealistic, even for a fantasy film. (and a but clichéd too) Everything is different from the older ones. There are new teachers, new spells, new creatures, and even a great twist at the end. I'm not sure if this is the best of all the Harry Potters, but it certainly ranks among that region, at least until I see the new one.8/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7,0,2,19 November 2005
Batman Begins," Okay, but far from perfect
","Batman has had a history of movies, both good and bad. I believe most of them were the usual 'kill the villain, protect the innocent civilians and save the day' sort of films, but this was different.Batman Begins is most likely different from the originals. Why? It has a much darker environment, and takes a much more serious tone. The dark environment is nice. The color black invades the screen, and everything on it- from the costume to the sky. It does have it's moments, but, the entire film lacks action or thrills. You may think that the night sky was only put in there to help you fall asleep easier. It seems to be more of a horror film than an action film. The entire film is good, but far from entertaining. It aims for a darker tone more than anything else, and that sort of tone is best for dramas, such as Falling Down and Mystic River. The hallucination/fear thing was a bit odd too. Hopefully, the sequel will be an improvement, just like X-2 and Spider-man 2.6.5/10",5,0,1,19 November 2005
The Princess Bride," I liked this film very much. It's pure entertainment and fun.
","I watched this movie in class while learning about medieval history. When the teacher said we were going to watch the Princess Bride, the class cheered. At, first I was thinking the Princess Diaries, but this movie is 1000 times better. It is pretty much a classic fairy-tale with some twists. It has scary eels, cheesy rats, giants and fencers, riddles, and a whole lot more. In the beginning, the movie follows around a bunch of different characters, until it gets to the main person. I thought that was pretty unique. This film also goes in many other directions, a normal fairy-tale wouldn't do. The most definitive example is when the main character says 'There is a shortage of perfect breasts in the world, you wouldn't want to ruin yours.' when the princess is about to stab herself in the heart. There are some flaws in this fairy-tale however. Of course, the rodents are pretty cheesy, but I can let that one pass. It is kind of romantic, (or, very romantic) for those who dislike it. The storyline is fairly predictable.-All Spoilers Below!!!- But, the main flaw is that Wesley, the main character, seem to perfect. He is better at fencing than the Spaniard. He is stronger than Fezzik the giant. (Well, defeats him.) To top that off, he outwits Vizzini and Prince Humperdink.-Ending of Spoilers- So, if you are into romance, or classic-like movies, or are perhaps trying to see any movie that's good, this is the movie for you.8.5/10",9,0,1,20 October 2005
The Incredibles," Impressive visuals, good humor, light-hearted fun, but un-original story
","You've got to admit it. The Incredibles is pretty incredible. It's about family of supers who seem to have somehow become super powerful by copying heroes from comics. There's Dash, who is like the Flash. Violet is basically the Invisible Woman from the Fantastic 4. Elastigirl is also like a member of the Fantastic 4, because she can stretch her limbs, just like Mr. Fantastic. Mr. Incredible, the main character, has super-strength, just like The Thing, or and average guy on Super-Steroids. Finally there's Jak-jak, who is 'supposedly' normal. They are retired, but Mr.Incredible is called back to work. However, not everything is as it would seem....As being one of Pixar's best films, The Incredibles also manages to stay one of the best family films out there. I guess it may be a bit unoriginal, but the characters are fun and the film is ultimately entertaining. There is just some sweet element to it that makes it fun, sweet, light-hearted and humorous... just like many films are meant to be. The only real flaw is that it seems to be a rip-off of the Fantastic Four.

School of Rock," A hilarious and clever comedy: School of Rock's rating is in the title: It's ROCKS
","A funny, witty and delightful picture, Jack Black's School of Rock rocks! Jack Black plays a hardcore obsessed member of a rock band named Dewey Finn, and he claims that he started the band. That must all stink for Dewey when he gets drunk during a concert and is kicked out of his own band. Desperate for money, (He is liable to get kicked out of his own apartment if he doesn't pay the rent.) Dewey answers the phone when a school principal is calling Dewey's roommate, Ned Schneebly. Ned just happens to be a substitute teacher, so Dewey Finn takes over the job, and pretends to be Ned.School of Rock tries to be, and becomes one thing, and one thing only- a comedy. But, it is a funny, witty and excellent comedy. So, it succeeds at its goal. How so? Take many of the scenes, like when Dewey is writing his name on the board. Or, look at the dialogue, which is also funny, but mostly because of the way Jack Black delivers them.It was no surprise that such a silly movie was inspired by Jack running down the halls of an apartment, blasting his favorite rock music.To counter the only upside, School of Rock doesn't have very many downsides. The characters are great, the jokes are not over-drawn and the film is never boring. The only major flaw I could find was that it was clichéd, and doesn't have enough things going for it (drama, action, story, special effects, etc.) to be any better than it already is.Though it is clichéd, School of Rock doesn't fail as a film. Besides, just about every film we have ever seen was clichéd. Anyways, you should like it, if you are a fan of rock music or comedy.8/10",8,0,0,27 December 2005
Million Dollar Baby," A triumphant drama about triumph
","I don't think I need to say much. Million Dollar Baby is Clint Eastwood's masterpiece. Clint showed his knowledge of capturing melancholy elements, and casting them out gratefully in Mystic River. This was different. Some may say that the drama in the film was the last 20 minutes, where the characters face a drastic experience, but that was not the main point.Million Dollar Baby is a triumphant drama about triumph. We see Maggie Fitzgerald (played by Hilary Swank) triumph and conquer her way through boxing matches by hard work, determination, and the love of her boxing trainer named Frankie. (played by Clint Eastwood, himself) We hear Morgan explain 'If there's magic in boxing, its the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance, beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas. It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you.' The story is narrated by Mr. Scrap. (played by Morgan Freeman) They couldn't have chosen a better choice. Morgan Freeman is an excellent narrator; he captures the emotion in the scenes where it is necessary. After all, why would of he narrated in March of the Penguins and War of the Worlds? Most dramas have plenty of emotion, but those with a short attention span will probably not realize it, because of all the dialogue. This is different.There is just something about this movie that makes it so beautifully touching. The music that Clint showed off in Unforgiven is apparent here. The acting is better than good- It's so excellent. Million Dollar Baby knows when to be light-hearted and fun, and when to be moody and depressing. For example, in the first scenes, Clint shows off how much heart he can really put into a movie with the bond between Maggie and Frankie. The film becomes even more fun with some jokes added here and there. 'You spent so much time on the floor, that I thought the canvas had a pair of titties.' Crude, but hilarious. During the final scenes, the film goes on kind of long, but Clint Eastwood still manages to show all the heart he can put into a movie, and he knows how to put in the dark and tragic elements he added into many other films.Million Dollar Baby does have some dialogue, but manages to grab a hold of your interest. There is a certain unexplainable feeling that is in the movie. It seems to have a magical quality to it. Maybe it's the fact that the relationship between Maggie and Frankie is sweet and beautiful. (Beware, it is not a romance.) It could be that you think of a girl-who knows she's poor trash-work as hard as she can with the love of Frankie. Or, it could just be the fun boxing scenes, where people beat each other up. Who knows? This is surely one of the greatest and most memorable films of the year. Not many other films capture the glory of victory like this one does. Million Dollar Baby is truly triumphant, beautiful, touching and almost flawless. There are simply not enough words to describe it.Best Picture is only the start of the praise that this film truly deserves.10/10Good: Beautiful, good boxing scenes, full of heart and joy, funny, carries a certain light-hearted tone throughoutBad: The last scene is pretty long",10,1,2,20 October 2005
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Appealing to a certain crowd, but enjoyable and fun nonetheless
","The Nightmare Before Christmas is a great story about a skeleton named Jack who wants to make Christmas. Why? Well, Jack accidentally stumbles upon this place, and is magically transported to Christmas Town. Jack is the king of Halloween, but Christmas is something new. Jack falls in love with the new place and decides to make Christmas. So, the misunderstood skeleton and his ghost dog persuade the town to prepare for Christmas. However, their plan doesn't go as it should of been, but I won't spoil anymore of this movie.Tim Burton usually makes strange movies, and this is no exception. However, it isn't so strange that you can't understand it. Tim Burton's classic story of Jack Skelington (that's his full name) is probably one of the best Disney movie and great for Christmas. (You can watch it on Halloween too, but then you'll get all excited for Christmas. It happens to me.) It has some drama, great music, interesting looks, and a good story too. The only main downside, is the unique story, takes no twists or turns, and the main appeal in the music.Oh well. The Nightmare before Christmas is still a great cult.RECOMMENDED 8/10",8,2,2,20 October 2005
Shrek 2," Very funny parody
","Shrek 2 is a very funny movie.It's the sequel to Shrek. The whole thing is a bunch of parodies of classic fairy tales, including Little Red Riding Hood, The Three Blind Mice and The Three Little Pigs. It also includes many pop-culture references, but not too many of them.However, even with it's jokes, it doesn't live up to the original. (in my opinion)(Sorry for the short review. I have many others to write.) 7/10Good: Funny, witty and sweet parody with good storylineBad: I am a bit biased, because I am comparing it to the original. Also, HBO shows it too much.",7,0,0,20 December 2005
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Calling it 'Style-over-substance' would be a HUGE overstatement, for it's pretentious and horrid in many ways
","I hate this movie a lot. I have been going on about it for a while, so I think it's time to take my anger out by making a review. I think I may have offended some people, and I apologize. So, here it goes: 'Kill Bill' is a very bad movie. I assume that Quentin Tarintino immediately drew in fans with 'Pulp Fiction,' because of its wit and it was high on the 'cool' factor. I saw some of it, and I will say that it was impressive. But, it looks like Tartintino became lazy by making this and co-directing the crappy 'Sin City.'The storyline of 'Kill Bill' is about its name. Bill attacked a woman who we know as 'The Bride.' Her name is censored when mentioned. Now, 'The Bride' wants revenge on Bill, and members of a gang called 'The Deadly Viper Assassin Squad.' So, she goes out and finds them and attacks them. The story ends there and it doesÂ… well, sort of.The story is something that was thought up in a few minutes. The Bride wants to kill people, and she does. As simple as that. 'Kill Bill Volume One' really is just shallow characters killing each other. First, she battles some woman. I have no clue what her name is though. Then, we find some history of The Bride. After, we find that The Bride was somehow knocked out. I forgot why. When she wakes up, we experience more brutal torture of people. Then, she gets a sword and kills lots of other people. The End.I find this very similar to 'Sin City.' It's a gory, shallow and pretentious action film that was made to show off a visual style and action scenes. The only real difference is that 'Sin City' had something close to a storyline. This one didn't.Supposedly, this is Tarintino's homage to martial-arts films. So, that makes it a masterpiece? That makes it get onto the Top 250 Movies? Is that why it's rated so highly? It has plenty of references to other martial-arts films. For example, Uma Thurman wears a suit that looks similar to the suit worn by Bruce Lee in one of his previous films.Well, 'The Ring' has loads of homages to horror films, including 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'Silence of the Lambs,' and 'Poltergeist.' Where's that on the Top 250 movies? Well, the homages seem as a cover-up for the story's' weakness. Why does a bodyguard fight in a skirt? I know people get attacked in a number of outfits, but since when does a bodyguard decide to fight in a schoolgirl outfit? The anime scene is near pointless, and doesn't even look like anime! It looks more like an attempt at drawing realistically, and ends up looking pretty ugly.Maybe it's because of the action. Well, there are only about two or three fight scenes, and they are only a bit exciting. There are plenty of other movies, which have better action. For example, 'Ultraviolet' (Another bad movie) had more action than 'Kill Bill' and a number of good fight scenes with good camera angles that gave it some flair. If that had homages to other films, would that be on the Top 250? I must say, even the action in 'The Karate Kid' seemed to have a certain wit to it.All the action in 'Kill Bill' is meaningless. It is meant to entertain. But, with loads of blood, what fun could it be? Its fun to watch The Bride slash her way through people, but after severed limbs appear, it loses it's fun. The violence in 'Saving Private Ryan' and (I think) the violence in 'The Wild Bunch' had purpose. But this, like 'Sin City,' is just sick, cruel violence.With that, there are PLENTY of movies with good action such as 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day,' 'Princess Monoke,' 'House of Flying Daggers' and 'The Quick and the Dead.' All of these had better storyline that 'Kill Bill', even if 'The Quick and the Dead' seemed a little weak in that department.Backing up to horror films, I see that this film plays out like a mix of 'Scream' and 'Hellraiser: Bloodline.' One person repeatedly tortures victims (like Pinhead) with a blade. (Like 'Scream') Sadly, it's not as thrilling as 'Scream.' It's as thrilling as 'Hellraiser: Bloodline.' The characters are thin. I'm not talking about thin, as in skinny, but lacking detail. Sure, 'The Bride' gives a bit of inside info on them (The 'inside info' is showing the character killing somebody else.) but the characters usually die after that.The action seems too unrealistic. Our main character kills plenty of people, but how? She jumps in the air and lands on her sword (It's stuck into the stairs.) but how does she do that? There are some movies with unrealistic action sequences ('House of Flying Daggers,' 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon') but those take place in ancient China. This takes place in a modern day setting and doesn't feel like either one of those films.That's why I hate the film. I can go on and on, but why should I have to? I suppose I hate it for all these reasons. Maybe the hype killed it. Or, it could be because Dan Grant's review influenced me to hate it. Either way, I don't like it.Yet, there are some good points to this movie. The action can be fun for some. I don't think torture is necessary though. The music was excellent. I liked the 'Bang Bang' and 'Twisted Nerve' song. I suppose it does seem interesting at parts, like when it turns into anime (even if the scene seemed pointless) or black-and-white. (But, this was already used in MANY other movies.)But, it still stinks. To me, this is about as bad as 'Ultraviolet'; it's shallow and uses style to cover up its crappiness.2/10",Null,46,91,15 March 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," It works for three reasons
","Last night, my neighbor let our family borrow a few DVDs. During dinner, our family watched Madagascar. After that, we were bored, and my sister suggested 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.' I thought 'Oh, why not?' and put the DVD into the DVD Player. I must admit, my expectations were low.I really enjoyed Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, much more than I expected to. In my opinion, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory work for three reasons.The first one is Johnny Depp's performance. He is an excellent actor. (His fan base is way too large.) He captures all the strange lines in a strange voice. He also captures all the weirdness that we would expect Willy Wonka to have, even if his character does sound weirder then he needs to be at times, like when he says: 'Good morning star shine, the earth says 'Hello!'' The second reason is Burton's weird world that he created. Like most re-makes, the newer one has to have better special effects. Charlie and the Chocolate Factory did have better special effects, and it made a better movie. It resembled the odd factory that the story takes place in.The third and final reason the new Charlie and the Chocolate Factory works out is because it's funny! For example, take this scene: Willy Wonka: If you had to choose only one half of your son, which one would it be? Mr. Teavee: What kind of question is that? But, the film does have its fair share of flaws. First of all, the film is weird, but seems like another adventure film, except with weird elements. It doesn't seem weird enough to seem original. Second, I preferred Gene Wilder to Johnny Depp. Third, the songs were not as good as the original. The songs in this movie didn't come as often, and didn't sound as good. The songs were just plain weird! Fourth, the film is unrealistic: even for a fantasy. The family is poor, and the father screws toothpaste caps on for a living. Now, how do they afford a television? But, the main reason it wasn't realistic was because of the children. Can the four wicked children not realize that they were being rude? No person in the right mind would play video games during an interview! Well, I enjoyed this film, for these three reasons, but thought it could have been better if those other reasons weren't existent.7/10 Good: Depp's performance, special effects, comedy, better than the original. Bad: Too weird, Wilder was better, songs were worse and it was too unrealistic.",7,0,3,24 December 2005
Big Fish," Maybe I didn't enjoy it as much as others did, but I still liked it. It' s pretty fishy, too....
","Big Fish is the story of Edward Bloom, and his son. The son believes that his father, Edward has been telling tall tales to explain about his life. This movie shows the tall tales and what happened. The result is a fun, but strange movie experience. This movie does show signs of Tim Burton, and you all know Burton. If not, I can tell you now, Butron is one of the most creative and odd directors alive. For example, there is a giant person in one scene, and conjoined twins in the next. You may not believe it now, but this movie is pretty weird. It tells of Edward's adventures, friends, visits, romance and life. Like the Princess Bride, this movie is pretty much a story told by one persons point of view.The movie is called Big Fish, but everything with the fishes is unexplained. There is a fish that looks like a naked woman, a fish attracted to gold, and the ending is a little fishy too. The movie seems to fail to explain why there are so much fish, and what they do with the storyline. However, this movie is a unique and original experience that is probably worth watching.7/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Null,0,0,20 October 2005
Toy Story," Classic Pixar! This is what future Pixar films should be like!
","Remember the original Pixar movies? Remember when Pixar didn't have stereotypical surfers and rappers? It was when the characters were fun and familiar. They didn't waste out time with farting jokes, but instead had smart jokes that weren't overdone. (even if they were more geared towards adults.) Luckily, we still have one good, classic Pixar movie; Toy Story. Peter Doctor knows how to make a fun and enjoyable family movie.Woody, is the 'top toy' of Andy's bedroom. He leads meeting and events, and is one of the most popular toys there. But, then, Andy has a birthday party. Everybody is worried about getting replaced by a toy, but Woody assures them that there is nothing to be worried about. Funny, how he ends up getting replaced by Buzz Lightyear-the new popular toy. Ironic, huh? So, he gets jealous and tries to kill Buzz, by setting up a trap and pushing him out the window. Then, the other toys find out, and think 'Let's kill Woody!' Wow, the irony in it all! The only way the toys will forgive him, is if he brings Buzz back. So, Woody and Buzz meet up at 'Pizza Palace.' After exploring a bit, they get caught by Sid-the sick and twisted kid next door.But, what makes this movie so good? Toy Story isn't your average kids' film. It seems to have a message in it all. Two unlikely friends, Buzz and Woody hate each other at first. Then, they slowly learn trust each other, and stick together through thick and thin.Toy Story is perhaps one of those 'feel good' movies. It's fun, and doesn't try to be anything it's not. Toy Story is an enjoyable, fun, and all-around excellent film. Be sure to put it on your 'To Watch' list.10/10",10,0,0,26 October 2005
Toy Story 2," Pixar made it funnier, but not as magical, but I would still recommend it
","'Toy Story 2' is the sequel to the classic 'Toy Story.' This time around, Woody is kid-napped by a wicked Toy Salesmen, and his friends go out on a journey to rescue Woody at Al's Toy Barn. Meanwhile, in the shop, Woody meets Jesse, Bullseye the horse and Stinky Pete.'Toy Story' is my favorite Pixar film, along with 'The Incredibles.' However, I don't think that this sequel lives up. Bias? I don't think so, and I sure hope not. My reason for this is because the film is so different. Let me explain.It seems to fall down a bit when Woody meets Jesse. I don't think Woody's history was necessary, and seems a bit weird. Woody's Round-Up gang seems to more closely resemble a group of stereotypes than real cowboys. Watching Jesse yell 'YEE-HAW!' seems to resemble the 'Dukes of Hazzard' movie than anything else and I don't think that 'Toy Story 2' should be compared to that.What else seem to be a bit odd are the 'Star Wars' parodies. Parodies are a funny addition to cinema, but it makes the film lack the heart-warming quality of the original. I simply don't think that parodies really work for these types of films.The third reason is the story. The ending takes darker twists and turns, but it still doesn't seem heart-warming. Who says 'Toy Story' ever needed to be complex? Who needs a twist at the end? I enjoyed 'Toy Story 2.' It's a great family film, but I'm sorry to say it doesn't live up to the first one.7.5/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",8,0,1,2 February 2006
National Treasure," Fun action-adventure movie
","National Treasure is a great action film. Nicolas Cage plays Ben Gates, a man whose family has had a history of treasure hunting. They believe that America's founding fathers have hidden a treasure somewhere, and left clues for us to find it.When Ben grows up, he searches for the treasure himself. Ben and three other companions start their journey in a tomb of some sort. When a disagreement comes upon them, two of the members betray Ben, and leave him stranded with Riley. Ben and Riley challenge the two traitors to see who can get to the treasure first.Heart-pounding action scenes and mystery elements make up the movie. The characters find clues which lead to more clues, which eventually lead to the treasure. Though a bit boring at time, the movie still holds up as an entertaining popcorn movie, which was underrated by the critics.6.5/10",6,1,1,18 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The start of a great series
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is the start of the Harry Potter movie series- which is an excellent series, by the way! This one starts Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, a young orphan boy, living with his grandparents. He discovers that he is a wizard, and is being sent to Hogwarts: School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. His grandparents are reluctant to send him, but luckily, Hagrid comes and takes Harry to his new school. Unfourtunatley, Voldemort (He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named) the man who killed Harry's parents is lurking about the school, searching for Harry.Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone makes a solid fantasy movie, but it seems to have a few clichés. And, it seems to be pretty simple and undeserving of a higher, for an odd reason, I cannot think of at the moment. I guess it just seems to un-imaginative. Magic and fantasy creatures don't immediately make a movie look imaginative.Harry Potter is the start of a fantastic series, but easily the 'lightest.' The other ones are a lot darker, which is why I like them better.7/10 (recommended)Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7,0,2,28 December 2005
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Good movie, but too based on the thought that the viewers had already read the book
","I thought Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban was the best of the series. I was probably wrong.Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was a VERY good movie and VERY well done. The movie centers on Harry as he takes his fourth year into Hogwarts. This year, Voldemort's (sorry, 'He Who Must Not Be Named') power is steadily growing, thanks to his servants, the Death Eaters. Early in the film, Harry and his pals are gathering at the Quittich World Cup. Quickly into the film, the characters are attacked-not by dementors this time- but by Death Eaters, Lord Voledemort's servants. (This part was very exciting.) The film moves fairly quickly, with more mystery than even the Prisoner of Azkaban had. Harry Potter is entered into the Tri-Wizard Tournament. How? We have yet to find out.Unfortunately for Harry, he has no choice except to accept what is in front of him. What also sucks for Harry is that people have died in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Yes, it's that dangerous.One thing new with Harry is that he is at the stage in life where he is changing. Hormones. More romance takes place, than it did in the others. For example, Harry seems to have a bit of feeling for Cho Chung. Ron gets jealous of his friends, because he can't get a date for himself. Hermione seems to have taken a liking to one of the other competitors. I remember Ron commenting 'Bloody hell' when checking out the bodies of the French team.The movie generally is exciting and face-paced, but even if it has a length of 157 minutes, it still moves too fast for its own good.For example, they never tell us what a port-key is. (The audience has to figure it out for themselves.) The character, Cedric Diggory is hardly introduced to us. There seems to be no beginning the scene where the Death Eaters attack. It just happens out of nowhere. The movie never tells us why Ron gets mad at Harry. (It is because he is jealous, as previously stated.) The three unforgivable curses are never explained. Even if they took out parts of the book to make the movie shorter, they seem to have taken out necessary parts along with them.I did like the movie, but..'THE MOVIE BASED ITSELF ON THE THOUGHT THAT THE VIEWERS HAD ALREDY READ THE BOOK.' Therefore, it made itself different from other book adaptations such as Jaws, Mystic River, A Simple Plan, Forrest Gump and Silence of the Lambs. Everyone who has read the book has probably seen it already, and knows what was going to happen, so they wouldn't have a problem. But, for newcomers of the series, it would seem badly-paced and a bit shallow at times.If I remembered the book, I probably would have liked it better. Too bad I didn't remember so much of it, so I will give this movie.8/10Good: Darker, better special effects, better storyBad: Thought viewers had already read the book, which probably contributed to the rushFeel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",8,0,0,25 November 2005
Mystic River," Beautiful
","There is no doubt in the fact Clint Eastwood is slowly rising from an actor in Westerns to the director of some of the most powerful films made. First, Eastwood made Unforgiven, which was praised by viewers and critics everywhere. It was a good thing Eastwood was able to follow it up.Sure, Mystic River may have been at least a decade past Unforgiven, but it is still a masterpiece cinema.After a misfortune happened in their childhood, three boys: Sean, Dave and Jimmy are separated from each other. Dave becomes the victim of child molestation, and grows up being paranoid. Sean grows up to be a detective. Jimmy grows up to have a daughter. After Jimmy's daughter is murdered, Sean is on the case, and suspects Dave.Here is a warning for all you viewers who are ready to watch it. Mystic River is not a light film. Mystic River is a dark tragedy about murder, paranoia and suspicion. Even the scenery has a dark a feel to it. It looks like the cameraman put something dark over the lens to make the scenery seem more gray. The characters all talk very quietly most of the time (put on captions if you can) and all have childhood secrets hidden in them.Sean, Jimmy and Dave are all well-crafted and deep characters. That's a necessary addition to this film.Sean, Dave and Jimmy slowly learn to mistrust each other and the outcome is dramatic and tragic. The darkness slowly embraces you, and let you get a feel for the film. It takes the tragedy of a single death, and lets it cause a whole lot of pain and trouble. Mystic River will move you, and will keep you watching until the very end.10/10",10,1,3,12 November 2005
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Potter is back- but now with more thrills and seriousness than the first
","'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets' is the sequel to 'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.' This time is his second year at Hogwarts, and something odd has been happening.I don't remember the story exactly, except that Harry is constantly warned by Dobby that something bad is going to happen. Harry finds Dobby to be a nuisance but something is definitely going on. Weird things happen after that.'Chamber of Secrets' is the most thrilling Harry Potter so far.(There's only been one before this.) I found it to be on the same level as 'Prisoner of Azkaban' even if it's inferior to 'Goblet of Fire.' I don't think this has as much story as 'Azkaban,' but it has enough action and thrills to match 'Goblet of Fire.' It also works as a decent horror film, even if it won't scare too many, it's entertaining. The sense of mystery is there, as always.With each new 'Harry Potter,' I suspect that the series will become darker and more mysterious. I just hope they don't ever get repeated.8/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7,0,2,23 February 2006
Psycho," 10 reasons to like Psycho
","Sometimes a film will make you fall of your seat laughing. Maybe it will shock you beyond belief. Or, it could make you weep. These are all reasons to love movies. But, what really makes a movie great is the fact that it has more than just on good point. Psycho has many great points.1) The story takes many twists and turns. It seems to change a bit after every set of minutes. The ending is the biggest twist of all. Psycho is nearly unpredictable.2) Perkins performance alone is deserving of an Oscar. We see him twitch and tremble as Arbogast interviews him. He slowly becomes mistrustful and dramatic as he talks with Marion. Anthony Perkin's performance in here deserves to be ranked among the 'Best Male Performances of All Time!' along with Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.3) Hitchcock knew how to work a camera! His creative style brings the film to life. He films on top of the car hood to see Marion and her stalker in the beginning. The camera spirals backwards, using Marion's eye as the starting point after the shower scene. During the staircase scene, there is a stunning bird's eye view so we can see the killer and Arbogast.4) The dialogue is fun and smart. How unforgettable is 'We all go a little mad sometimes'? It will keep you entertained and thrilled to hear. Even if the film is full of dialogue, it manages to keep you interested.5) Do you know how much Hitchcock worked on this film? I heard the shower scene took days to film! Think about all those shots! Good thing it was all worth it, because the shower scene is one of the best parts of the film.6) Another small, but genius part in Psycho was the part in the cellar. Lila Crane accidentally falls backwards and hits the light bulb, causing it to swing back and forth, to create a spectacular lighting effect.7) The musical score is one-of-a-kind. I hear it re-playing in my head all the time. It's often parodied in shows and other movies. But, don't listen to them. The best music is in the opening credits.8) The murder scenes are visually fantastic. The staircase scene brings sickening pleasure to the mind.9) The voices we hear when Marion is driving away explain what's happening back at her hometown. This saves screen time and allows the story to continue without wasting precious time.10) The 'main character' Marion is killed off right after the infamous shower scene. I guess she really isn't the main character, (Norman is.) but it makes a fun twist, and the story still continues to flow.Multiple things like this define a movie. So what if it isn't scary? Psycho is a one-of-a-kind film. It's THE Psycho. It's THE movie. It will forever remain timeless.10/10",10,0,1,25 October 2005
War of the Worlds," A wild thrill ride best viewed in theaters
","Spielberg's version of H.G. Wells classic is another shocker from Spielberg. Just like some of his other creations such as Jaws and Jurassic Park, War of the Worlds is a genuine thrill ride.Ray Ferrier is an ordinary citizen living in an ordinary world. That is, until his peace is disturbed when a giant lightning storm hits. The storm isn't ordinary, though. For example, lighting seems to hit repetitively in one spot, and the wind seems to be going in the opposite direction it usually does. If that wasn't enough shock a giant alien ship rises from the ground, and starts to kill people, lots and lots of people.The thrills are at their highest, when giant machines start consuming humans by the minute. If you really want to know how big they are, compare the size of the people to the size of the ships. Now, THAT is scary. The 'war' (Ray running from aliens) is undoubtedly thrilling! However, the noise isn't balanced out. The beginning contains almost inaudible dialogue. The film then becomes unbearably loud when the aliens start attacking. Plot holes may also be the demise of many.But, the film makes a good thriller, and moments of drama ---small spoiler! --- (such as when Ray kills Tim Robbins) make the film very fun.7/10 Good: Thrills, drama, some twists and fabulous narration by Morgan Freeman Bad: Noise is unbalanced, plot holes and definitely isn't better the second time",7,0,1,2 January 2006
Wedding Crashers," A few good jokes don't save 'Wedding Crashers' from turning into a wannabe sex comedy disaster
","The storyline of 'Wedding Crashers' involves to men invading weddings to meet girls. Eventually, they are invited to stay at a family's house, where both of them try to get their dream girls. It fails for a couple of reasons. Let me explain.First of all, it stars Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson. I don't disrespect these actors, but they have starred in many stupid/silly comedies that haven't succeeded too much. I liked 'Dodgeball' but disliked 'Anchorman' and it almost seems like that their next movie is going to be a failure because of what their past looks like. I'm not saying it's bad that they are put in comedies, but it seems kind of clichéd, like putting Clint Eastwood in Westerns. The only real difference is that many actors famous for comedies (such as Adam Sandler) have had a history of bad movies, (Such as 'Billy Madison') while most of Clint Eastwood's Westerns have succeeded. (Such as 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.') If you've seen Vince and Owens's past movies, you may not have high expectations for this one. (I hated 'The Big Bounce.') Second of all, the film tries to be a sex comedy, and it fails at that. I saw the unrated version, which meant more vulgarity and more non amusing jokes. For example, take the mom (an old lady) who wants Owen to feel her chest.Is that a bad joke? Yes it is.There are a few good laughs, but they are too simple or cliché to work. They often include simple jokes such as repeating the same word over and over. The rest of the movie is just pure boredom.Owen and Vince are both well-loved comedians, but it seems like they don't contribute too much to their parts. 'School of Rock' succeeded as a comedy mostly because of Jack Black. But, it seemed like 'Wedding Crashers' would have done just as well with average actors in their places.'Wedding Crashers' was obviously made because the writers could include women getting topless in many scenes. The two writers of this film (Steve Faber and Bob Fisher) have little experience with movies and don't do comedy so well.There is little to get excited about, because 'Wedding Crashers' is yet another one of the many comedy disasters out there.3/10 Good: A few funny jokes, some people may like the exposure of women in the unrated version.Bad: Clichés, boredom, bad jokes and predictable. The exposition may be a problem to some.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",3,2,4,20 February 2006
Ice Age," Ica Age doesn't disappoint
","Ice Age is a prehistoric film about a mammoth (Manny), a fast-moving sloth* (Sid) and a saber-tooth tiger (Diego) trying to return a human baby back to its 'tribe.' Manny is a rouge mammoth migrating the opposite way of other mammoths. Sid is caring (but stupid) and wants to return the baby and hangs with Manny, seeking protection. Diego promises to kill the baby behind the others back because the baby's father has killed more than half of his pack.So, the odd group travels, fighting many obstacles and trying to reach the group of humans. There is not much of a plot, but this film has a great sense of humor and fun for the family. It is more of stupid funny, but funny nonetheless. The characters and the setting are unique, which makes this film more enjoyable. What is also strange is that the humans don't talk, but the animals do. As odd and funny as the trio starring in this film, Ice Age is one of my favorite Pixar films. Pixar has done a great job on this film and I really think it is fantastic.Great movie.*A man walking moves over 26 times faster than a sloth.8 /10",8,2,3,20 October 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Short and Quick Review!!!
","Anchorman: Legend of Ron Burgundy was a mildly funny movie. It was stupid, but it had its moments. For example, there was that one scene with the mentally retarded guy at the news station screaming 'I don't know what we are yelling about!' However, most of the humor is gross and vulgar and has unnecessary reference to body parts.I suppose it's all a matter of tase. Many will find it hilarious. Others will not. I thought it seemed pretty stupid, but that's just me. There are plenty of people who will crack up at it.Yes it is stupid and silly, yet it is also funny at some parts.

Jaws," Maybe I didn't enjoy it as I should have, but it's still a smart thriller
","Jaws. A shark is killing people in Amity Island. The only people who can stop it are Chief Brody, Hooper, and a sailor named Quint.In the beginning scene, a girl decides to go skinny dipping in the ocean. Not a very smart move. We see her getting attacked, but by what? A shark. We don't see the offender, but the girl dies, and we assume there is something terrible in the water.So, that's how it starts off. Events lead up to the thrilling climax. We are quickly thrilled by a fast-moving story. The audience is excited when the three men set out at to kill the menacing shark.Sure, a movie 30 years old probably isn't scary right now, but perhaps at its time. So, what do we have, here? You will be glad to watch the thrilling, fast-moving, and genius movie 'Jaws.' Well, it's entertaining at least. The story is a bit similar to many B-movies, but 'Jaws' doesn't have a moment of bad acting or a single plot hole. Peter Benchley and Steven Spielberg are geniuses. The only things I didn't enjoy were the fact that the shark was pretty cheesy, and that there were boring parts. Oh well 8/10",8,7,13,20 October 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Lucas improved on episodes 1 and 2 in the newer trilogy by making 'Star Wars: Episode 3- Revenge of the Sith' stylish, but a bit too stylish
","Lucas is a fantastic film maker. He started with the original Star Wars trilogy, and continued with the high-flying adventures of Indiana Jones. The Star Wars movies were probably the more popular of his two series, and they're still up and running. The storyline is finally complete, and with a solid ending.Star Wars: Episode III- Revenge of the Sith combines dazzling special effects, top-notch stylish action and a story full of twists. Lucas completes his story as Anakin, father of Luke, strays toward the Dark Side while Obi-Wan and the others fight in various wars.While the action is nice, it is not fully necessary. It is even perhaps the main flaw in the movie. The movie is completely over stylized for its own good. I mean, George Lucas manages to create a battle between just about every single character in the movie. Let's see: Obi-Wan versus Anakin, Mace Windu versus General Grevius, Yoda versus the Sith Lord and Wookies versus Droids. There are so many battles, I can't even keep track! I think Count Dooko might have been slipped in there somewhere. Any more battles might consist of something like Padme' versus R2-D2 or CP3O versus Jar-Jar Binks, but I believe that Lucas is that desperate to put in action scenes. He does seem like he is that desperate, though. More than half of the movie consists of stylish action scenes. The story, while taking a few twists, seems comparatively simple.Here's an example of the first ten minutes or so. There are spaceship battles happening. Lots of lasers and shooting. Then, Anakin and Obi-Wan land on the ship, and kill a couple of droids. They enter the hallway, and kill more droids. They run around for a bit, and get trapped in a Ray Shield. Then, Anakin and Obi-Wan are taken captive by General Grevious. They escape by taking their light sabers, and destroying the droids. Then, we have a battle sequence between the jedis and the bodyguards. After the bodyguards are destroyed, we get another battle sequence between the two jedis and General Grevius. As you can see, at least 3/4 of the first ten minutes are taken up by fight scenes. How's that for over-stylizing?The sad thing though, is that Lucas seemed to forget about the old trilogy. Sure, the newer one was boring, and Lucas improved on that, but I believe the old trilogy was supposed to have some magical quality hidden in it. It IS a good film, but calling it the best of the Star Wars movies means you probably have not seen the originals.7/10",7,0,3,9 November 2005
The Lion King," If you can ignore the fact that it is geared towards children, you will enjoy it, because it's more then a children's flick. It's a film that you will love.
","The Lion King is a great movie. Its great storyline, catchy songs, and beautiful artwork are what define it. This seems not to be fully appreciated by everybody. It is obviously directed towards younger audiences with the songs and the characters, which seems to tear out all the interest from people as they are watching this, while they ask themselves 'What am I watching?' Let me assure you, if you can see past the 'child-ness,' you may truly get a chance to appreciate this film. And let me tell you, you will like it.The story for The Lion King is incredibly complex for a Disney story.Mufasa is the ruler of Pride Rock, and after he passes away, Simba will be king. Mufasa does pass away after a stampede caused by his uncle, Scar, and Scar convinces Simba it was all his doing. Simba flees the kingdom in search of a new life, until he is called back by his friend, Nala.The Lion King is not the first movie to deal with romance, but one of the first movies to deal with guilt and jealousy. The Lion King is sort of a 'child's first drama' as I like to think of it. Dramatic as it is, The Lion King is easy to pay attention to, unlike most dramas. Perhaps many other dramas could have taken after that.I do believe that it was based on Hamlet, but even if it did copy Hamlet, it did a very impressive job.This will entertain for generations.9/10Good: Dramatic, well-drawn, good songs and funnyBad: Well, some people might think that they're 'too cool' to watch it. It does have some farting jokes too. Eww.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",10,0,0,20 October 2005
The Terminal," Spielburg can still make good movies; The Terminal one is sweet, innocent and humane.
","What can I say? This was a wonderful movie. It's full of simplicity, sweetness and humanity.After Spielberg made us jump at Saving Private Ryan and Jurassic Park, and after he made us afraid to go into the water with Jaws, and after he made us cry with E.T. and Schindler's List, the famous director decides to settle down. It wasn't a bad choice.The Terminal is something you can just sit back, watch and enjoy. You don't have to rack your brain for answers to the twists. You won't have to cover your eyes and the gore, or worry about crying in front of your friends. All you have to do is watch.The Terminal is a simple movie, but in a good way. It doesn't use CGI and action scenes to cover up its simplicity, like some other movies. It knows that it is simple, and easy to understand, so it's easier to watch.The Terminal doesn't overdo anything at all! The jokes keep humane and sweet, without profanity, sexual references, stupidity or unnecessary buildup. It doesn't try to be the best film you've ever seen, but the result may be something close. It's creative. The storyline is new (while not exactly perfect) and the characters are fun. Tom Hanks uses his acting skills and creativity to play Viktor Navorski, who uses his creativity to survive in the airport. He meets people and he helps them with their lives, and eventually changes the airport a bit.The film is funny, but also romantic. Viktor falls in love with a struggling woman named Amelia. You have no choice but to smile at the sweetness.But, that's not all. The Terminal is touching, and you will feel passion and warmth in your heart when you watch. It may be a bit melancholy at first, when Viktor arrives at the airport, and is scared, but later becomes romantic. The ending is touching too. The happy ending will make you smile.I know I am mostly copying Roger Ebert, so I'll add in something original.The Terminal is also about how the man changes the airport. After the line 'You can learn something from him' (Of course, it's talking about Viktor.) the film shows the impact of one man in one place. His sense of justice and good-heartedness changes the airport in a small way. Tom Hank's performance is Oscar-worthy. There haven't been many feel-good films since his famous 'Forrest Gump.' I don't really know how to describe the beauty of the film. It's just good. See it. You won't regret it.8/10",8,1,3,13 November 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Wow
","It is hard to believe Stephen King could create such a movie! I know he does a lot of horror movies, but I never knew he was capable of such drama.Shawshank Redemption is narrated by Morgan Freeman (as always) and is about when Andy is sent to prison for life after being framed for his wife's murder. He becomes an inspiration as he talks about hope throughout the film. That's where the film's power lies. The speeches about hope and freedom in a dark and cold prison are moving. Other scenes have don't have inspirational dialouge. Instead, they rely on actions, acting and music. All of these create some mood that is felt by the viewer.I did have my expectations, and the film didn't live up to them, but the film is undeniably good! I don't think it's the second best film of all time, but still it makes my top 20 list. At first, I was disappointed. But, I had to eventually give into the power of 'Shawshank Redemption.' It's still hard to believe Stephen King did this. 8.5/10",8,0,0,3 December 2005
Scream," 'For a film that knows so much about horror films couldn't they make this movie a bit better?'
","A serial killer stalks a group horror movie-obsessed teens. There is plenty of chilling telephone scenes that will excite you. The movie is fun and exciting, but far from perfect.The teenagers love horror movies. There are plenty of references to them. I remember the killer asking who the killer was in Halloween. They know that corn syrup was used for blood in Carrie. One scene talks about Jodie Foster's role in Silence of the Lambs. I even remember one of them saying 'We all go a little mad sometimes,' which is a famous line from Psycho.So, after all that, I thought 'For a film that knows so much about horror films couldn't they make this movie a bit better?' The characters hear and see the killer, but every time they think it's a joke. None of them ever tries to kill the killer, even after they've kicked and hit him. Then, we get the same thing over and over again. Don't go alone. Don't open the car door. Don't try to escape through the doggy door. Come on! Wes Craven should have made the people more realistic, and thought 'What would they do in real life?' Instead, he makes them so stupid things, which causes them to get killed.I think there were more reasons that I just can't remember. Oh well. One thing I CAN'T add is that the film is not scary, thrilling or entertaining. I enjoyed Scream. It would have been better if I didn't find myself yelling at the dumb characters, though.",Null,0,0,31 October 2005
The Silence of the Lambs," A Sick and Twisted, yet smart and satisfying thriller
","Films don't usually get as creepy or thrilling as the top-notch, first-class creepy and chilling thriller known as Silence of the Lambs. There is nothing that can take your breath away with so much style and wit like Silence of the Lambs does. You'll need to watch this film in order to understand how thrillers are created and executed.The young and feminine Clarice Starling, who is training to be an F.B.I. agent, must find the whereabouts of a serial killer named Buffalo Bill. The only way possible is interviewing a captured serial killer named Dr. Hannibal 'The Cannibal' Lecter.Hannibal Lecter is perhaps the best movie villain that ever lived. Anthony Hopkins plays his role with perfection, because you will hear Lecter's voice stuck inside your head. 'I ate his liver with fava beans and a nice chianti,' will re-play in your head over and over. Hopkins deserves an Oscar for his portrayal of the most sinister character on the big screen. Creepy, sinister, devilish, clever and cannibalistic-How much better can it get? If the villain isn't enough to entertain you, then perhaps the hero will. Jodie Foster, also a gem as the role, plays the feminine F.B.I agent in training, Clarice Starling. She is seemed to be well-liked (often flirted with) but insecure and very timid. Starling is very realistic, and shows how timid the human nature can be.At a first viewing, all I could keep my mind on was the prison escape scene. I kept repeated the phrase 'Oh God,' and kept preparing myself for what was next. During a second viewing I realized the depth of the story line and the genius behind it all.One thing this movie definitely has is atmosphere. The killings, the characters, the dialog, and everything else that leads up to the first appearance of Hannibal Lecter makes the film look so delightfully creepy. Even though Hannibal is silent when we first see him, it is considered one of the creepiest introductions ever made. Of course, we can't forget about this man. Even after the ending, he delivers one last line that sends shivers down our spines.Silence of the Lambs may make you a bit disgusted, yet thrilled and excited. You will stay on the edge of your seat.Silence of the Lambs is a masterpiece, atmospheric thriller.10/10",10,2,3,21 October 2005
Bruce Almighty," A predictable, but funny comedy
","Bruce Almighty is an about-average comedy with some stupid-silly humor, but it manages to be light-hearted and funny throughout.Bruce is played by Jim Carrey. In this movie, Bruce is an average guy with way too many problems. His girlfriend is close to breaking up with him. His News Team fires him. His dog isn't potty trained. He has nothing better to do than blame it all on God.So, he gets a message on his pager to visit some sort of building. He throws his pager out the window (I think the guy wouldn't stop paging him. I forgot.) and it gets run over by a car. Then, Bruce goes outside to find that his pager was still working. So, he is convinced to go to the building. There he meets a janitor played by Morgan Freeman. The janitor tells him to go to the seventh floor. When Bruce reaches that floor, he finds the electrician, also played by Morgan Freeman. Morgan tells him that he is God. (Why have you gone to comedies Mr. Freeman?) Bruce doesn't believe that Morgan Freeman/the electrician/the janitor can be God. Yet, God convinces him, and says that it isn't too easy being God. To prove this, God gives Bruce all of his powers for a week with a couple of obvious rules.I'm too lazy to explain it, but I can tell you that two problems arise: The first is that his girlfriend leaves him, and Bruce can hardly do anything about it. The second is that Bruce unknowingly answers a bunch of dangerous prayers that turn the town crazy.What the movie is really good for is comedy. (It's starring Jim Carrey. What did you expect?) It's a bit stupid at times, but never too stupid, and emerges looking more silly. There is about one decent joke every once in a while, which may cause a chuckle, but probably not much more.Some of the jokes are just nonsense, but quite decent. I forgot most of them, but they could be good for a laugh. The monkey part was probably the funniest part of the whole movie.The main flaw in Bruce Almighty is that there seems to be a delay between jokes- a passage of time. The story is predictable, but takes up too much time developing to actually get to something funny.This will appeal to the audiences who love to laugh.Good: Well, it is funny at times and never TOO stupid Bad: Predictable, not enough jokes to get a high score Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Null,0,1,2 February 2006
The Sixth Sense," The Sixth Sense isn't just scary: It's an un-predictable and smart drama that will surprise you
","Famous horror-movie director, M. Night Shylaman made his career (Or made his name known amongst fans) with 'The Sixth Sense.' Child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe has just received an award, praising his abilities and skills in the psychological department. However, the joy is soon halted when a naked man (Well, he does have underwear.) breaks into the Crowe residence. This man claims to be a former patient of Malcolm's, and knows the roots of primitive human fear. This scene is very touching- or, shall I say: powerful? The reason for the power in this scene is because it makes us connect with the insane person inside all of us; the person who feels ashamed or angry; the guy in this scene (Vincent) is the crazy person within us.After that scene, Dr. Crowe feels ashamed and guilty about what he brought onto the patient. So, he tries to redeem himself when another patient visits him: a young boy named Cole.At this point, the film seems to be more or less dramatic and thrilling than the beginning. We learn about Cole, who doesn't seem to be the most normal child around. He's bullied by kids at school. He has scratches all over him. His mom doesn't trust him. Plus, he has one big secret and one very famous line: 'I see dead people.' We learn about Cole, and start to wonder about him before we sympathize for him. When his relationship with Dr. Crowe becomes tight, the film begins to become more and more dramatic and thrilling.To paraphrase another IMDb user, The Sixth Sense doesn't just give us scary stuff, but it shows what fear is. It makes the characters think about fear. Just listen to Vincent's speech at the beginning.I'm not sure if this is totally true, but I can tell you what is true: The Sixth Sense takes oh so many twists in the story. It seems un-predictable. I have frustration trying to guess the ending, because I didn't even know if Cole was seeing things or not. If he was, what was going to happen next? Of course, the biggest twist is at the end. It's probably the most famous thing in the movie. I mean, it isn't like one of those movies where they say 'He was the murderer!' The film hides the twist, but it introduced it to us at the beginning! The film doesn't hide the possibility of it; it just doesn't expect the audience to guess it. I guess it's hard to explain without adding spoilers, so I will just say: See the film.But, don't see the film purely for the ending. See it for the acting, the suspense, the story and the pure quality of the film. See it because it's a good movie.I shall end with that.9/10 Good: Very suspenseful and dramatic with good acting. It's also close to un-predictable for me.Bad: I can't think of anything for now. It seemed kind of slow moving.Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",8,0,1,26 January 2006
Rear Window," One of the most gripping and breathless thrillers ever! Totally creepy and brilliant!
","Hitchcock has always been a genius. Just about every one of his films is thrilling and dramatic. I know that I am treating him the way some fans do to Tarintino or Burton, but I just plain love his films! I just finished Rear Window. It blew me away. Instead of just simply saying 'This film rocks,' I will describe in detail the greatness and superiority of this film.Like most Hitchcock films, Rear Window stars James Stewart. He plays L.B. Jefferies, a photographer for a magazine who recently broke his leg when trying to take a photo in the middle of a racetrack. (His boss said he wanted something new and exciting.) So, L.B. Jefferies has absolutely nothing better to do than just sit down in his wheelchair and watch the neighbors do their daily business. But, one night, he hears fighting, bickering, and then a scream from one of his neighbors apartments. Then, he observes as the man living in the apartment enters and exits his house three times during the rain. Now, isn't that odd? What could it be? Murder! Rear Window is a very complex and one hell of a movie. The drama, thrills and comedy do not under whelm the viewer.Rear Window is successful as a thriller. Wouldn't it be weird to wonder what your neighbor was doing from at least seven feet away? L.B. Jefferies sees him doing mysterious actions, but doesn't know exactly what he is doing or thinking. Plus, he has to make sure that the neighbor doesn't see him! Rear Window is surrounded by a creepy atmosphere and scares and bewilders the viewer, whenever the neighbor does something. What is he doing? Can he really be murdering his neighbor? Where is he? As the plot grows more and more complex, the viewer can only hold their breath until the action happens. The film is also effective, considering the distance between L.B. Jefferies and his neighbor. It gives the viewer an increased feeling of uncertainty, and makes the film even more seemingly complex and vague.Drama occurs between the characters, as they each play to their own tricks. L.B. Jefferies and the audience aren't the only ones being creeped out. How unforgettable is the scene where Lisa slips a note under his door saying 'What have you done with her?' Even with that, Rear Window can be a comedy. It doesn't make much of an effort for it's jokes, and cleverly hides them amongst dialogue.Lisa: I wish I was creative like that.L.B. Jefferies: You are. You're great at creating difficult situations.Yep. Rear Window is just about perfect. But, Hitchcock fans expecting an unpredictable twister of a movie will be disappointed, because there are no major twists. Then again, a major Hitchcock fan wouldn't expect that, would they? Besides, I can't tell you how many thrillers ended up confusing due to plot twists.10/10",10,0,1,28 December 2005
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," 'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' is a feast for the eyes, with some other good qualities, but falls short of amazing
","'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' is the final installment of the famous trilogy. It picks up where the second left off, wherever that may be- and where it is is the group approaching Mount Doom. Gandalf, Legolas, and all those other guys wander and find themselves in a war against Sauron. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam struggle with the Ring guided by the creature Gollum.The film is quite similar to the original. It's still style-over-substance. Frodo and Sam still are close friends. Merry and Pippin are the same way too. The ring still has to be returned to the mountain. Gollum still looks like a non-muscular version of Tarzan with that tiny little cloth he has on his waist. Yet, the story seems a bit different. Instead of another adventure film, Return of the King has a war in it, and has Sam and Frodo testing their bonds of friendship more than ever.The little drama that is has is good. No, it probably won't make you cry (though it did for some people) but it is, welltouching. Remember the ending for the original Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring? (SPOILER!!!) I thought it was 'sweet' when Frodo was leaving in the boat and Sam jumps into the water and says 'Of course you are; and I'm coming with you!' (END OF SPOILERS!!!) The film's high point is the special effects. Of course, Peter Jackson had a BIG budget for this movie, and it was made up because it was the second highest-grossing movie so far. (Next to Titanic) The audience is given spectacular eye-candy with the armies of orcs, and goblins and other various fantasy creatures. We are also treated to breath-taking detail of mostly everything, from the beautiful costumes to the engraved writing on the swords. We are also treated to some very awesome scenes where the camera positions itself high up to see the detailed landscape below- which is full of trees, grass, armies, animals and much more detail.Like the previous films, 'Return of the King' is very long. It's over 200 minutes, and even more for the extended version. The ending seems to be the longest part of them all; because it feels five minutes longer then we really wanted. It really annoyed me when I first saw it, because it just wouldn't end! The beginning seemed a bit slow too. It took a long time before we even got to out main characters.If you remember the previous films, the group split up for some reason I can't remember. It's good that the characters vary a lot from how they look, what weapons they carry and what kind of creature they are. It would be hard to remember them if they weren't varied.The action is pretty good. With lots of sword-fighting and some other cool stuff, like Legolas killing a giant elephant-like creature. Of course, it's nothing like Jackie Chan's flips and karate moves. But, we are treated to a couple sword fights, although I think the action in the first was much better.The story takes no major twists or turns, and can be watched if you haven't seen the first two. As I said earlier, 'Return of the King' is special effects; 100% breath-taking, proportioned, amazing, spectacular special effects and costumes. However, special effects, costumes and CGI only go so far. It displays the effects through camera work and for a long period of time. I suppose this movie must have been a spectacular treat in theaters, but it won't quite blow you away if you are seeing it for the first time on television. You will enjoy; I did. You will say 'wow' at the special effects, but you will realize that there ARE better movies out there that don't rely so heavily on a budget.8/10 Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",7,1,2,11 February 2006
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A fun and silly comedy
","Monty Python and the Holy Grail is one of the most loved and famous comedy titles of all time. It is very funny with a pretty strange sense of humor. One of the earliest jokes in the movie was in the beginning credits with the moose in the captions. That was pretty funny. Then they said that llamas made the movie, which also made me laugh. Then in the beginning of the movie when a man and King Authur are talking about sparrows and coconuts, the man says 'Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?', which cracked me up. Then in the scene with the dead people, one of the conversations was: Man 1: How do you know he's a king? Man 2: Because he hasn't got s*** all over him. (Keep in mind, these were poor villagers talking.)That was also hilarious. There were many, many more strange and funny moments in this movie. Some were the Black Knight, The cartoon monster, the taunting French men, and many many more.However, many jokes were flawed. Some jokes weren't clever, but just very silly. Others had a very long build-up for a joke that wasn't even very funny to begin with. Then, they repeat some jokes. For example, the 'No he's not dead yet, Oh no! He died!' joke, was heard three times.Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a funny movie, but those with a different sense of humor may enjoy it more.8/10",8,1,2,20 October 2005
Aladdin," Aladdin is a fine children's cartoon.
","Aladdin is one of the many Disney Classics. Like the others, Aladdin has songs, detailed animation, and a good versus evil setting. It is pretty predictable, and has a main character who usually falls in love with some pretty girl.One of Aladdins many strong points was the talented voice acting of Robin Williams. The ability to portray so many different and silly characters that the genie does is one of the best parts in the movie. It is similar to how Eddie Murphy got to play Mushu in Mulan.Something else remarkable about this film was the storyline. The storyline starts off with Jafar (the villain) trying to find the Magic Lamp which will give him three wishes. Jafar finds the Cave of Wonders, in which the lamp is hidden. However, the cave won't let just anybody in. The only person who can enter the cave is a 'street rat' named Aladdin. Meanwhile, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread and running away from the guards. Of course, this means a song would be involved. So, while singing a-long with the guards, Aladdin is stealing a loaf of bread because he has no money. Another plot that is happening at this time, is Jasmine's story. Jasmine has to marry a prince, but doesn't seem to like any of the ones her father picked out for her. The three character's quests and stories later merge together to make the main storyline. However, in the storyline there is one small flaw. How come Aladdin is the only person who can enter the Cave of Wonders? That's what I have been wondering. Is it just to make a storyline?Anyways, ignoring that detail, I wanted to say that it seems like Aladdin has a little something for everyone. It has action for the little boys. Girls may like the romance. Little children will probably like the singing and the fact that it's a cartoon. Finally, dads will probably enjoy the fact that Robin Williams is doing the voice acting in this film. (My dad does anyways, and requested to put that in there.)

Sin City," It was a sin to have been made
","-Many Spoilers- Note: Skip to the third-to-last paragraph for a shorter version!Is this what passes for cinema nowadays? Violence, Nudity and some cool special effects make a film good? I don't think so. Sin City is a collection of four stories in some city full of crime. The first story centers around a guy named Hartigan who is trying to rescue a kidnapped child named Nancy. The bad guy happens to be a son of a senator. So, anyways we should move onto the flaws. The story moves way to fast for its own good, which makes it lack lots of depth. It is like Robert Rodriguez expected us to easily follow along with this movie. Take the scene with the hit man taking Hartigan. They point a gun to his back. Seconds later, Hartigan is at their base. A couple seconds later, he beats them up, and finds out who sent the hit men to take him. Then, the scene is over within two minutes, and makes the film look shallow. To add to that, a new character with short screen time is introduced every couple seconds, but it doesn't matter does it, because all the characters are all the same! There are about five types of characters in the film: 1) The hero guy who doesn't like guys who mistreat women. 2) The weak villain who likes to mistreat women, and gets beat up by character number one. 3) The woman who doesn't have enough brains to realize that she might freeze to death if she doesn't have any clothes on. 4) The hit man/mercenary/criminal/henchman that dies within a minute. 5) The evil guy who must be stopped. Too bad that introducing a new character makes up most of the twists.The second is about a guy named Marv who had a girlfriend named Goldie, who was murdered, and Marv spends the story searching for the murderer. The characters are the same, except the villain is a wannabe Hannibal Lector who enjoys killing naked women, just like Norman Bates (Psycho). This story suffers all the problems of the first, except the action is more unrealistic and the story is way more adult. Marv takes millions of bullet shots, a car hitting him, and some more tortures, yet he miraculously survives. As for being more adult, we are treated to more women for forgot to get dressed, and one who had their hand eaten off by the wannabe Hannibal Lector. The third story is okay. It starts off with 'character number 2' (Jackie Boy) mistreating 'character number 3', until 'character number 1' (Dwight) shows up. Dwight teaches Jackie Boy a lesson by dunking him in an unnecessarily un-flushed toilet. Then Jackie Boy runs away, and Dwight chases after him. They end up in Old Town, where 'character number 3' is numerous. They kill Jackie Boy, who happens to be a cop, which threatens some treaty made between the prostitutes of Old Town and the police. So, Dwight and the girls who are half-naked in the cold rain set out to dispose of the body and fix the treaty or whatever. What I found really odd about this particular story was that it gives women a bad name, and makes them look superior to men after they kill Jackie Boy and his gang. Now, do you really want to 'do it' a girl who could kill you? So, the rest of the story is just introducing more bad guys. The fourth is a continuation of the first. I think I actually liked it. Hartigan is released from jail, and tries to find Nancy after a mutilated finger was sent to him. (I think he was put in for hurting the Senator's son.) Nancy has been writing letters, and when the finger is sent to him, he suspects the bad guys have found Nancy. It turns out that Nancy is safe and sound, and actually an exotic nightclub dancer. It also turns out that the Senator's son is back, except he is a yellow freak of nature. Why? Well, in the first story, Hartigan 'took his weapons away' which means he shot him in between the legs. (I don't understand why that was necessary.) So, after they re-built his 'thing' there were some side-effects. This story is actually good, but only because it takes everything from the first story. It just introduces the same characters grown-up, and the same lines delivered once again, except they are delivered more seriously this time around. >>>In short; Sin City's story is un-developed and shallow, the characters are all similar, the story also seems to be repeated, (even the twists) the action was disappointing and the naked women may offend some. The lines delivered are somewhat gross, for no apparent reason. ('I'll cut you in ways that will make you useless to a woman.') It's an obvious style-over-substance that doesn't seem to fulfill what we expected. I'm sure there was even more.<<<There are many hits and misses to Sin City, but they are not evenly weighed. Just because a film is the 'coolest movie of the year' does not mean it is the best. Besides, for a film considered nothing but 'visually stunning' and 'artistic' the action was disappointing. The only thing artistic was the black and white mixed with various colors to represent the comic panels.If you've seen Mystic River, then you will know the phrase 'We bury our sins. We wash them clean.' So, bury this sin and wash it clean from your memory. Or, you can sell it on E-bay.5/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",4,6,13,3 December 2005
The Breakfast Club," Classic 80's teen movie by John Hughes. The Breakfast Club appeals to almost every body in its target audience
","The Breakfast Club is a movie that most teens hold deep inside their hearts. Why? Simple. The Breakfast Club deals with some problems teens hold within themselves: Insecurity, hormones, trouble with parents, trying to be popular, bullies, etc. This allows the target audience to relate to it very well. The Breakfast Club takes these problems and sets them in each and every one of our characters. Andy Clark is a jock dealing with parents. Brian Johnson is a nerd dealing with bullies. John Bender is one of those bullies who spend every weekend in detention. Clare is an insecure girl trying to be popular. Allison she's just weird. (She has a sandwich with sugar from pixie sticks and Captain Crunch cereal. Yum.) These five students unite during one detention; each one of them did something wrong or broke a rule. This is how the film starts out. John Bender (the bully) starts up a conversation, and pretty soon secrets are revealed, and character development takes place. That is pretty much what happens during one day in detention.This movie is not only a well-made drama, but also makes a decent comedy. This film, of course is by John Hughes, who has made many comedies, such as Home Alone, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation and Planes, Trains & Automobiles. There are many scenes of humor. One of them is when the principal emerges quickly from the bathroom and tells the students: 'I will not be made a fool of' and leaves with some toilet paper hanging from the back of his pants. So much for not being a fool.The Breakfast Club isn't complex or too inventive: It's just a drama made for teens; a drama with acting, comedy and fair realism; a drama that you will love, especially if you're a teenager.In short: The Breakfast Club's target audience is teenagers, and works well for them. Ask any teenager who has seen this movie, and they will most likely tell you that they love it. (Well, probably) Note: The film doesn't deserve the R rating. It's rated R for language, but the characters don't cuss as much as they would nowadays. They just use a couple of 'hells' and 'damns.' Well, that goes for the version I saw on AMC.9/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",8,1,2,15 January 2006
Shark Tale," A poor attempt to reference to pop-culture.
","Remember all the good old classics? The father trying to let the son inherit the kingdom in The Godfather? Or, how about the scary theme music in Jaws? Not interested in those? Maybe music is your 'cup of tea.' You may enjoy the fast-talking rappers from the ghetto, or singing 'Don't worry, about a thing, because every little thing, is going to be all right' to Bob Marley.Perhaps this is what Pixar was thinking when they came out with Shark Tale.Oscar is a fish in debt. He owes his boss tons of money. His lady friend gives him a pearl that once belonged to her grandmother, because she cares for Oscar. Oscar sells the pearl for the money, (Don't worry. This was the intention of it all.) but greedily bets it all in a horse race. After his horse loses, his boss orders his to wannabe-Jamaican jellyfish to kill him. Before the two jellyfish have time to kill him, a shark comes. The shark's name is Lenny, who is friendly, but must become a killer. He tries to make it look like he eats Oscar, but in his compassion, he saves Oscar. This is found out by Lenny's brother, Frankie, who gets angry and tries to punish Lenny. An anchor falls on top of Frankie, and kills him. Oscar takes this opportunity, and pretends he killed the shark. Oscar takes up the new name 'Oscar the Shark Slayer.' Now, we get to the bad parts. There were so many flaws; I don't know where to start. First of all, the characters were very bad. The gangster sharks seem to be copying The Godfather. (One of them is even played by Robert De Niro.) But, of course most children wouldn't be too familiar with The Godfather, would they? How about Jaws? The sharks also seem to enjoy singing the theme to Jaws. You will find the opening scene very similar to the part where Hooper is placed in the cage. Even 'Say hello to my little friend,' when a tiny shrimp tries to get revenge when Lenny's father tries to make Lenny actually kill something.A Bug's Life was similar the Seven Samurai. The Incredibles was incredibly similar to the Fanatastic Four, but out of all computer-generated films, Shark Tale has to be the least original.'Young people all into their ghetto rap and hip-hop, nowadays. What if we put in some music into the next Pixar movie? That way all those hip youngsters will love this one,' said a worker at Pixar Studios.Oscar lives in the ghetto. He dreams of becoming a rapper. He uses the term 'old-school.' He plays Play Station 2. Is this what the stereotypical teenager imagines nowadays? Obviously, Shark Tale tries ('Tries' is the key word.) to connect with the children living in the year 2004. Sadly, they fail miserably. The two jellyfish sing Bob Marley songs, for crying out loud! Besides, killer whales don't hang out with sharks. (They eat sharks.)That's a mistake in an already flawed movie.5/10",Null,0,1,22 October 2005
Princess Mononoke," It will change your view of anime
","When many people think of anime, they think of many different things. Some may be schoolgirls with samurai swords. Others may be sick and perverted jokes, and pantie shots. Then again, it may be sheer stupidity, with the characters faces undergoing silly transformations to show emotion.However, Hayao Mayazaki changed all that with Princess Mononoke. It is not as strange as most of his movies, but probably the best out of all of them. It has gruesome action (though not very bloody, like Kill Bill) and a very good story line.Ashitaka is cursed by a demon on his arm and goes to the Forest Spirit to pray for help. However, he is caught in a war between humans and forest animals. Of, course, he is a human, he would naturally work for the humans. But, he falls in love with Princess Mononoke, the girl living in the forest. So, he has to decide between the sides and still get cured by the Forest Spirit, before the curse on his arm eats him alive.This proves that not all anime can be silly and gross. Princess Monoke has very emotional drama, great action, well-thought out storyline, touching romance, and breathtaking visuals. The only flaw I could really find is that it gets old, after watching it too much. (Then again, I've probably seen it 100 times.)It probably doesn't matter if you do, or don't like anime, you should still see this movie. It's brilliant. -10/10The only reason I wouldn't give this a 10, would be that I would not want to watch it again. (Even the greatest films get old after hundreds of viewings.)",10,0,2,20 October 2005
Jurassic Park," Now I remember why I liked dinosaurs so much....
","It's true. I saw this film when I was little and I can't blame myself for falling in love with it. I used to study everything about dinosaurs and loved nothing more. How could you not love dinosaurs after seeing Jurassic Park? It has great well-planned action and wonderful CGI (computer generated images) that still look good today. However, this movie does suffer from a slow beginning (It's mostly just talking.) but soon gets more exciting. Starting from boring, this movie goes to exciting, to edge of your seat. Jurassic Park combines the amazing action and the amazing CGI so well, that it makes a film above amazing.You must be tired of hearing how amazing this film is, so I'll explain it to you. Dr. Alan Grant, a paleontologist, is invited to Jurassic Park, which is a park showing off real-life dinosaurs. (You already knew that.) The dinosaurs were made by DNA found in they're blood, and the blood was found in mosquitoes, which was found in sap. However, the DNA wasn't complete, so they used frog DNA as a substitute.Now, for the problem. Of course the workers have to keep safe, so the dinosaurs are surrounded by electric fences. However, one worker is also working for another person named Dauhgson. Dauhgson wants the dinosaur embryos, so he hires the worker. The worker opens up the security doors and turns off the electricity to steal the embryos. Sadly, not everything goes as planned. Turning off the electric fences means nothing but a weak fence stops the dinosaurs from escaping. So, the dinosaurs escape and wreak havoc among Dr. Alan Grant and his crew.There would be no other way to show the amazing and stylized action without the amazing CGI. Combined with the storyline, this film is great; it will leave you on the edge of your seat.8/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",8,1,2,20 October 2005
Dodgeball," Fairly Funny, but gets old quickly, and has a lot of sick-minded humor
","Dodgeball is a funny movie. It's not the funniest movie ever, but it's not the least funniest movie ever. It's filled with puns and jokes that will make you laugh, even if most of them are pretty simple. The downside was all the sick-minded humor. They have hundreds of references to body parts. Oh well. It's still fairly funny. I mean, who could forget the part: 'Okay. Goodbye crazy guy.' 'I ain't crazy, and I ain't a guy.' And then, there is the part 'Let me introduce you to my team: Blade, Razor.....Blazer,' which is a bit funny. Yet, the film is a bit gross, and gets old pretty quickly.6/10Feel free to send me a Private Message regarding this comment.",Null,0,1,25 October 2005
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," Damn, We're in a Tight Spot!
","'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?' is the Odyssey-based, music-filled, Coen brothers' title that stars three men (Everett, Delmar and Pete) who have escaped from their prison work. Everett, Delmar and Pete end up looking for a treasure which is buried by Everett's cabin. Along the way, the three encounter many obstacles such as: sirens, bible salesmen, horse-eating family members and a cow on a cotton roof. (Which really isn't an obstacle) This movie is pretty unique and funny at the same time. The story and music may be a bit unoriginal, but the jokes certainly are. They aren't slapstick or complete randomness, but a bit clever, and silly at the same time.Filled with jokes and tons of bluegrass music, there is some more appeal added into the movie. Though, some of the movie really depends on your sense of humor and taste in music, it is a great film, nonetheless. It also spawned one of the greatest quotes in movies: 'Damn, we're in a tight spot!'Those Coen Brothers (also known for comedies such as 'Fargo' and 'The Big Lebowski') sure know comedies.8/10",8,1,2,20 October 2005
