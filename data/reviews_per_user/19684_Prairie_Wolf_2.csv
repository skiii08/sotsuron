Blade Runner 2049," Not What I Thought It Would Be, But Wonderful, Nonetheless!
","The movie was not what I expected, but it was captivating. It was, complex, intriguing and mesmerizing - keeping my attention focused through the entire 2 hours and 44 minutes. I felt the movie left the viewer wondering if they plan on a third installment - they certainly could go that way.The one thing I felt sorely lacking was the music. The soundtrack in the original Blade Runner was an integral part of the ambiance; the soul and heart of the film. When I hear the music from the original soundtrack, I am immediately transported to a scene, a moment seared forever in my memory, another place and time surreal to our present world. The original soundtrack by Vangelis was haunting, unique - it was the heartbeat of the movie, like blood flowing through the body, the music flowed through the film, imbuing it with a life of its own.Acting was top-notch. The sets and imagery were outstanding, immersing the viewer in the world of 2049. Just as with the first movie, there were enough plot twists, questions left unanswered - while other questions were answered, but done so that the viewer was left with more uncertainty.And what of the dog? :-)",8,6,12,12 October 2017
It Follows," Ghastly - Not Ghostly or Even Remotely Scary
","I have never given a movie a 1 star rating until I saw this film today. No spoilers to be addressed, as there was nothing to spoil - the movie was already fatally flawed. Faint story line from start to finish, and not a single moment where I felt scared, haunted, afraid or any of the other things one expects while watching a horror movie. There was some nudity, sprinkled with mild sex scenes, for those who care. And, I had to wonder where they filmed the movie; jokingly saying it must have been Chernobyl, as so much of the area filmed looked like it had been abandoned after an apocalyptic event - peopled with humans who appeared zombie-like. Plus, it would seem the movie-makers obtained most of their set material from 1970-1980's secondhand stores. Odd, that! And not in keeping with the time period of the film.All-in-all, very disappointing. As my spouse and I exited the theater, we heard negative comments from the total, small handful of movie-goers in attendance, as they were leaving, too.",1,132,303,1 April 2015
