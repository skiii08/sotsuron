Minority Report," re: refreshing, intelligent sci-fi
","Mind blowing, intelligent sci-fi, with a lot going for it. For starters, the fantastic production design makes this the first sci-fi film in a long time to really create a whole new world. There are many wild previews of life in the mid-21st century , from how computers will look to how we'll drive to how big business will invade our privacy. The cinematography is also noteworthy, an effective washed-out look with a lot of blues and greens. The story is fascinating, centering around an interesting philosophical point - what if technology can predict crimes that haven't happened yet. Is it just for the soon-to-be criminals to be arrested and punished? On the less cerebral side, there are some jaw-dropping action scenes that are highly inventive and dizzyingly paced. Tom Cruise plays his usual role - short man making $20 million per movie - but turns in a solid performance. And as for history's most popular director, Steven Spielberg adds one of the more memorable entries to his list of accomplishments. Highly recommended, with something for everyone.",8,0,0,25 January 2003
Sin City," Hyper violence kills stylistic achievements
","Sin City is a nauseatingly unpleasant place to visit.On the good side, it's got an incredible visual style. Director Robert Rodriguez outdoes the wild visuals and CGI advancements of his Spy Kids series.But the problem is the film is probably the most disgustingly violent major movie ever released. It's just drenched in non-stop gore, dismemberment, torture, misogyny, castration, evisceration, cannibalism, children about to be raped and murdered, people dismembering other people then feeding them to animals while they're still alive, etc. NC-17, where are you? But the worst thing is there's just no point, other than perhaps Rodriguez had some extreme misanthropic anger to vent, exacerbated by making the tame, PG-rated Spy Kids movies. And this movie is his humanity-filled punching bag, which he beats to a bloody pulp with the consistency of stewed tomatoes.Is it a well-made movie? Sure. But why would anyone want to watch it? It's about as uplifting as watching a web cam of a Tyson poultry slaughter house, or animals being incinerated at your local humane society. Sin City is one place I wouldn't visit.",2,3,6,10 May 2005
V for Vendetta," Excellent Allegory for the Bush Years
","If you cherish democracy, or if you mistakenly believe you still live in one, this film is a must-see. V for Vendetta is spot-on regarding the dark years of the United States: 2001 to 2009. Although set in England, it covers all the bases: using religion to suppress any objective thinking in the masses; widespread surveillance of individual citizens; rampant misinformation and lies from the government; faux terrorism and fear used by the government to control its own people; and the irony that the powers that be actually profit directly from the result of said terrorism (in this case, it's pharmaceutical companies profiting from bio-terror attacks, rather than oil companies benefiting from Middle East turmoil). And finally, the film reminds us that it's the duty of all us to oppose tyranny, and governments like those of George W. Bush. Bravo to the Wachowski brothers for a selflessly political film aiming to safeguard our freedom.",10,9,16,25 April 2006
