3:10 to Yuma," phenomenal film
","One of the best films of the year, certainly one of the best of the 'new breed' of westerns to come out in the past ten.Gritty and realistic but without the gratuitous gore thought necessary in updates of this genre.Russell Crowe and Christian Bale (why is he constantly overlooked by the Academy?)are at the top of their game. The supporting cast is outstanding with nary a false move made by anyone. Very happy to see the entire ensemble nominated by SAG. Ben Foster has true chameleon like qualities and makes for an excellent villain.I have not seen the original but I have to say the ending was unexpected. Highly recommended.",9,2,5,27 January 2008
Shakespeare in Love," Kudos to Stoppard, Madden, Fiennes & Paltrow
","Wonderful film full of Tom Stoppard's witty repartee and stunning visuals (including Joseph Fiennes and Gwynneth Paltrow.)  One question, are there not enough English actresses to go around? Why is Ms. Paltrow continually cast as British? Her accent's good but...",8,0,0,11 January 1999
Inside Man," Almost perfect caper film
","Well written, well acted (not to mention well cast) film about the perfect bank robbery. The dialog crackles and Denzel Washington's characteristic intelligence and intensity is evenly matched to that of both Clive Owen and Jodie Foster. Once you've seen it, you'll want to see it again to find out why you never saw the end coming! I was hooked from the opening scenes and for most of the film I believed the title had a different meaning than it turned out to have. This is Spike Lee's most mainstream film and is also one of his best. Highly recommended. For those who enjoyed this film but are unfamiliar with Clive Owen's work, I also recommend 'Croupier.'",9,1,2,18 August 2006
The Sixth Sense," You'll be thinking about this one long after you leave the theater
","This is that rarest of creatures, the intelligent summer chiller/thriller. Solid cast including a subdued Bruce Willis (who let's face it, may never win an Oscar but can be relied upon to entertain) and an amazing Haley Joel Osment. His performance is the glue that holds the whole thing together. If you don't buy him, you don't buy the movie. To discuss the plot further would be a disservice to the writer/director as well as to those who haven't seen the film yet. Do not, under any circumstances, let anyone tell you the ending! (It should be a capital offense.)",7,0,0,9 August 1999
Hart's War," what's with the trailer?
","I just saw this movie and although I went in under duress, I came away having been thoroughly entertained.  This movie was nothing like I expected it to be. What studio ad exec came up with that trailer? It has almost nothing to do with the movie I saw. Bruce Willis is the star in name only. (As his is the only 'household name' in the cast.) He actually has a supporting role. The star, playing the Hart in the title, is Collin Farrell. An actor apparently thought of so highly despite his having appeared in approx. 3 American films, that he merits 'above the title' billing. I hadn't seen Farrell before, although I have been trying to rent the dvd of 'Tigerland' for months. (My local store only seems to have 1 copy and it's always out.) He is very good here. I finally get the 'buzz' surrounding him. This film was chock full of good performances, not the least of which was the German camp commander, Maj. Visser. This film is less a war movie than a courtroom drama set in a POW camp. And while court room dramas tend to be pedantic, they also, when done right, can keep you on the edge of your seat. It was directed by Gregory Hoblitt who managed to do just that with 'Primal Fear'. This movie will lose nothing in the translation if you wait for video or dvd but it will make a dandy Saturday nite rental.",Null,0,0,28 February 2002
The Soloist," What happened??
","The Soloist is a beautifully crafted film.Robert Downey, Jr. is, as always, wonderful as LA Times columnist Steve Lopez. There is something about his own well worn face and expressive eyes that imbues his portrayal with a truth that another actor would not have been able to bring. The script does not gloss over Lopez's flaws and turn him into a refugee from a TV Movie of the Week, and all of those flaws are visible thanks to RDJ's performance.Jamie Foxx, in my humble opinion, proves that 'Ray' was not a fluke of casting. Even more than his nearly note-perfect portrayal of Ray Charles, his Nathaniel Ayers, Jr. says this man is a truly multi-faceted actor. (Frankly I hope more people see The Soloist and reach that conclusion. It might help his next scheduled release 'Law Abiding Citizen.')I think in the hands of director without the deft touch of Joe Wright, this could have been heavy handed, treacly, feel-good pap. Despite the fact that this is a true story, the audience is allowed to go on Lopez's journey with him. Nobody's holding up flashcards and telling the viewer what to feel next.Here's what I want to know: What the h*ll happened to this film's marketing campaign? (or should I say the lack thereof). It was pushed back twice and finally released in April of this year w/almost no press and was quickly forgotten. That usually means it's crap. In fact, it sends the message that it's crap. I've heard rumblings that the scheduled release last fall (which would have put it in awards contention)was nixed because of the country's economic downturn, and who wants to see a movie about homeless people? Are we really that fragile? This movie deserves to be in awards contention,probably at least as much, if not more than some that were.The argument could be made that with the expansion of the Best Picture category to ten slots that it has a better chance this year. The April release date, however, is probably still a handicap. And it would be a damn shame if this were overlooked. Foxx, Downey,Jr. and Wright all deserve consideration.",9,0,0,8 August 2009
