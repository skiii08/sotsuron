The King's Speech," Wow what a movie
","Best movie this year and I can not see how one better will come along. Best I have seen in years. Not what I expected. Expected a bit drab and dreary English type movie. This was so far from what I expected. I will see this again. Colin and Geoffrey should be given the Oscar NOW. Seeing Mr Rush in this as well as Pirates of the C shows his wonderful abilities have no bounds. Much of the same can be said of Colin as well. Everyone coming out had nothing but good words about the actors and the story. The movie ran the gamut of emotions. I hope Mr. Firth played King George as he was. If this is so King George was indeed a great man, husband and leader.",10,0,2,22 January 2011
