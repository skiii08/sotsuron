","Best And Most Involving Movie Experience I Can Remember Having At The Cinema; And The Best Disaster Movie Ever, Heart Wrenching, Gut Wrenching Frightening Frightening Frightening!! And it makes it so much more involving because it's a true story!Like it says in most other reviews for this film it's a MUST-WATCH for the spectacular visuals alone!Make this the one film you watch this year at the cinema if you don't go much because it will be the Greatest visual cinema experience you'll ever have had!! I watch LOADS at the cinema and it is for me! I'd definitely recommend seeing it in an IMAX screen if you have the choice.If I could give it 15/10 I would, the amount I felt while watching this..WOW! And it was so visually breathtaking and frightening I've never experienced anything like it. And like I said before I've seen practically all the big budget blockbusters that Hollywood has to offer at the cinema, since the millennium and a load before.",10,5,13,30 September 2016
Captain Marvel," Not the usual well-rounded and fun Marvel entry.
","Unfortunately, this sits in my least favourite Marvel movies. I was a bit shocked while watching this because i had high hopes as with any new entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe as they have always delivered great and well-rounded superhero action movies.The first quarter of the movie was intriguing, action filled and engaging like typical Marvel flicks. Then Nick Fury appeared which was fine, but then he stayed and boyyyy did it drag with him in tow, became a bit boring and no fun which is usually Marvels quarenteed trademark. It was like when he kept appearing in Iron Man 2, which were the worst parts of that movie too and made it drag.Then they both spent too much time with her old best friend and pilot buddy Maria Rambeau and her daughter, which made it even more boring and cheesy in parts.Jade Law, Brie Larson(who seems like she has great potential moving forward as a part of the Marvel team), and Ben Mendelsohn were in fine form.This Marvel entry was just missing the pace and fun of the previous entries. And it was certainly no where near as entertaining as Wonder Woman when it comes to female superhero entries.The opening and ending of this movie were engaging, but in between is where it dragged, which is unlike Marvel movies.After watching this i don't feel like it was a necessity to watch before heading into Avengers: Endgame. I would happily have waited to watch it on bluray or streaming. And any tiny Endgame info there was, i could have picked up on a youtube 'breakdown' video.5/10",5,4,6,20 March 2019
Us," Us is NOT the tone&pace the trailer has led you to believe you're buying a ticket for.. 2.5/10
","I get that this is a psychological horror but what this movie felt like was like watching nearly 2 hours worth of nothing.It starts nowhere and it ends nowhere...and is filled with long drawn out confrontation in between. Don't get me wrong there are moments in the confrontations which are a relief from the slow pace of this film but they, unfortunately dragged these scenes out waaaaay too long which then loses your focus again. And be prepared to scream at the screen(with your inside voice of course) for some stupid decisions by certain characters.Very much over hyped by the critics and promotions. This felt like a pretty tv movie til they meet their doppelgangers then it switches up a gear...but not for long.This is not a film i would recommend to casual moviegoers, i would recommend this to people that love films by Terrance Malick and films like Hereditary and The Witch(2015).Films i would recommend if you are in the mood for a great psychological horror are The Shining, Rosemary's Baby, Jacob's Ladder or In The Mouth Of Madness.And i guessed the twist of this movie from the trailers. Yesssssss :)2.5/10",4,2,4,27 March 2019
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Shocked At How The Great Marvel Studio Has Made The Worst Spider-Man Movie!!
","I'm a fan of the previous 5 Spider-Man movies and as i'm a big fan of the Marvel Universe movies i was sooo sure of a great Marvel version with Spider-Man:Homecoming. Their movies have great stories teamed with outstanding action, a good sense of humour and great character development. I've only disliked one Marvel Universe movie which was one of the early ones and sadly this one joins it now.It made me really wish SONY had gone and made the sequel to Andrew Garfield's The Amazing Spider-Man 2!The reasons my friend and i weren't keen on this Spidey movie were....It felt rushed..Story didn't flow smoothly..It felt kinda pointless..Scenes felt crowbarred, e.g. Iron Man scenes.The 'teen' scenes were long, kinda boring, weren't fun or funny like in all the other Marvel movies.Aunt May felt like background, unnecessary.Pointless teen characters like Zendaya's, as if someone said we need Ali Sheedey's character from Breakfast Club in this, unfortunately it was pointless in this.The film was emotionless and felt nothing towards any of the characters, unlike the emotional progression and connections in the previous Spider-Man movies.The villain had an underdeveloped screen presence, so his connection to Spider-Man felt threadbare.Just a shallow and empty experience, and the action sequences couldn't save it sadly.The whole film just felt like a wasted opportunity.4/10",5,19,31,9 August 2017
Suicide Squad," I LOVED Batman V Superman but the Critics got SUICIDE SQUAD Right, What an AWFUL Film!
","I Actually Think The Critics Were Too Generous With This Film!!I LOVED THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY, MAN OF STEEL AND BvS. I'm not that knowledgeable about the comic book worlds for DC or Marvel, but i do love watching movies. I was looking forward to this film even with the poor critics response.What a mess, right from the start. Awful film. It was a roadrunner way of filmmaking, the structure and editing of scenes didn't give a chance to connect with the films story or characters. It was like a unentertaining mtv music video. For a film with such a frenetic style of storytelling it was boring, i was counting the minutes, the end didn't come soon enough.The dialog was embarrassing at times.The few shoot'em up action scenes were unremarkable and unmemorable. The finale was a joke of unbelievability, even for a superhero film, a cgi heavy ending that was like a damp squib to an already unexciting movie. Like a really rubbish supernaturals vs humans confrontation.I love Jared Leto but The Joker's scenes weren't created right or edited to show the pure evil he is. His scenes were so random and nearly irrelevant it was a shame to watch. Leto's talents were wasted and utilized incorrectly in this film, not like in Batman and Dark Knight, where they savoured his menace in each scene and built on it. This just looks like rapid fire weird faces. And they should have chosen a different look for the Joker too, to be honest i liked it before i actually saw it in the movie.Viola Davies character was not convincing at all as a goody-baddie.As soon as the gang get to Midway City it turns into the Will Smith show. They may as well have called the film 'The Smith Squad.' All these so called ultimate baddies who follow no one but themselves, who defy law, order and hierarchy and anyone else tbh turn into a bunch of little sheep. The film makes him out to be the leader of them. And he's the least nutso guy! When have these kind of ultimate baddies/mentally deranged characters ever followed an average bad guy! I'm not a fan of Will Smith so maybe it stood out more to me but still it made no sense. He did most of the talking throughout, besides Harley Quinn and Boomerang who mainly had a bunch of one-liners. He was the voice of reason here!Boomerang was my favourite character, he seemed the most interesting and was cool enough to expect a solo movie from, not that DC would.I'd like to see Jared Leto's Joker in another film also, with more of a storyline. Besides those two though, i wouldn't care if any of the others in this appeared in any future DC films again. Only because they weren't presented well in this.I hope there isn't another Suicide Squad film only because i'd rather see a different DC comic movie get a chance.Fantastic Four was more entertaining and well made than this for me.And the use of hit songs just felt forced. Not like say Guardians Of The Galaxy where the hit songs were few but important and elevated the scene and film.1/10",1,8,15,7 August 2016
Baby Driver," I Recommend That You Watch This At The Cinema To Fully Appreciate This Visual & Sound Spectacle As Intended!!
","Woooow what an experience!!If you only watch one film at the cinema this year,so far,then this is definitely worth going for for that buzz you won't get from a home viewing i guarantee! The marrying of sound, songs and visuals is of an outstanding beauty and originality!If like me you enjoy the unrelenting excitement of the recent batch of Fast And Furious films then you will love this film too. And this sprinkles a bit more viciousness on top from its characters as well. This film is just cool as F@$%!The music chosen works brilliantly throughout.The car action is jaw dropping. The performances from all the cast are great, the only change i would have made was having Griff(Jon Bernthal) play the Bats character instead of Jamie Foxx. I found Jon Bernthal to be way more menacing and threatening like the Bats role demanded, but thats not taking anything away from J.Foxx, he made it work too.I highly recommend this film for people in search of adrenaline pumping car action sequences, some pumping gun battles, some badass criminal characters in that pulp style and for people who don't mind a hint of romance in the vein of films like True Romance, The Getaway, etc, as it works brilliantly in this too.Highly original, never been done before and unless they do a sequel will never be done again i reckon, so do yourself a favour and go watch it.10/10",10,12,21,1 August 2017
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," My Least favourite Spider-Man movie. Definitely NOT what the critics led me to believe.
","99% critics rating on Rotten Tomatoes, which is the Highest rated DC and Marvel movie EVER! And an 8.6 IMDB rating...so i had high hopes going in, plus i love the previous Spider-Man movies but boy was this one average, below average actually hence my 4/10. I feel duped by the critics AGAIN. The critics scores for this movie are WAY too suspicious for this.Let's get the animation out of the way first since they seem to be raving about it so much. Through watching many many animations we all know that nice visuals don't make for an entertaining film, especially if the other components of storytelling don't add up. The animation was as good as any good ones out there already, so i would say that it's not a good reason to go and spend loads on money at the cinema for that reason alone. This definitely can be watched at home. At random times throughout the film they do this kind of 3D visuals animation which give your eyes and head a funny turn tbh. If you've watched a 3D movie without glasses then you'll know what i mean.The film was so haphazard editing and story wise that it really took you out of the flow of the story, so it made it difficult to stay connected to the characters and story. This made it feel like it was aimed at young children to stop them from losing interest. It almost just felt like constant random scenes which didn't flow smoothly story wise.The other thing that made the film tiresome when trying to connect to the characters/story was the use of jokes/one-liners, they were relentless and was full of them. I love comedy in superhero films, the MCU do a great job of that and the previous Spider-Man movies too but this was like a kids animation style of non-stop but with adult humour, that i'm afraid i didn't laugh at once...and i usually laugh at nearly everything. Besides myself, there was only an adult and 2 children in the screen and i didn't hear them laugh either tbh.The story was pretty standard, exactly what the trailer tells you but i did get restless and bored when there was no action.Its my least favourite Spider-Man movie and as animations go its not good either, especially when you've got Pixar, Illuniation, Manga, etc delivering such epic and fun movies already.Nicolas Cage was my favourite Spider-Man in this, even though he wasn't one of the central characters and didn't get much screen time. It would be great if they made a film just centered around his character sometime.There were 2 or 3 short emotional scenes in this that i liked, i'm a sucker for that stuff lol.There is a post-credits scene so stay til the very end.4/10.",4,69,241,12 December 2018
Dunkirk," A Decent Sunday Afternoon Movie Best Watched At Home.
","Firstly, i want to say i enjoyed the film, nothing amazing like the critics and Christopher Nolan fans have made out but i think he achieved what he set out to do, with all the parameters he set himself regards to the differences with actual Dunkirk history and the filmmaking style he wanted to use.It certainly isn't one of the greatest war films ever made, far from it but it is a decent experiment in filmmaking, if your into that kind of thing.Me and my friend both thought it was like a good film you watch at home on a Sunday afternoon. And having watched it on the big screen i would say that thats the best way to fully enjoy it too, at home, which i would rather have seen it at. You'll understand when you see it, its just one of those films.If you watch this in Imax like i did, make sure you take a tissue because the sound becomes unbearably loud after a little while and you may need to plug your ears up, especially when the aircraft segments start and with the bigger explosions abit later on. Even with tissues in ears its pretty loud too but its nicely bearable.So if you do go and watch it at the cinema then i wholeheartedly recommend watching it in the standard 2D screens, mainly because of the unbearably loud volume and bassy sounds in Imax, mixed with the other film soundtrack noises makes everything sound muffled. And also because it isn't such the big visual spectacle as they've lead us to believe. Nolans previous films and those of say Ridley Scott or Peter Jackson have given more scope and reason to watch their films in an Imax screen.Overall though, i found the film enjoyable, JUST above average. It plods along nicely for a 95 minute feature, with 10 minutes of end credits also. There isn't a dull moment in this from my perspective. Nolan does make you feel sorry for the characters he wants you to feel sorry for, but for a war film it isn't a greatly emotional one. I don't understand why its been given such high ratings as the visuals, sound, story, character development and overall feel don't warrant such grand praise. I can understand why half the audience have really disliked it for the above reasons also, as there was no storyline and there's barely a character for the audience to attach themselves to. Plus there's a lot of difference in regards to the sheer numbers of aircraft's, boats and people not present here. I did feel the grandness of the peril these boys were actually in really missing because of this scaling down from Nolan, which was his conscious choice to leave out. I have to admit that adding CGI here and there really would have given this moment of history a more realistic vision of it's devastating scale.I expected to see really amazing choreographed air combat sequences too but they were just OK, they did the job but nothing spectacular or exciting. There have been way better and breathtaking aircraft combat scenes from most other films, war or sci-fi!If you didn't know Christopher Nolan's intentions in his film as i've briefly alluded to above and are expecting to see an epic masterpiece of a war movie in the vein of films by directors like Stanley Kubrick, Michael Cimino, Brian De Palma, Oliver Stone, Ridley Scott, Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg or Mel Gibson, where the visuals mesh breathtakingly with story, characters and emotions then you may be disappointed with Dunkirk. Dunkirk feels more like a brief and confined moment of an evacuation, with small scale pockets of peril at its heart, and knowing that will help you appreciate this better, hopefully, but by how much i don't know, for me its a 6/10, just above average.It's definitely not on the scale the critics and fanboys have sold it on, for a general audience! Even though i enjoyed it i still don't see how such high ratings are being thrown at this. And its a shame the film doesn't convey the epic grand scale feeling of terror that history has told us.",6,52,96,23 July 2017
Joker," An Oscar winning performance and a very Affecting big screen achievement.
","Such an interesting and unconventional direction for a DC movie, yet it still ties into that Universe in its own little ways, which were a delight to see for me.It's a very effective and Affecting movie with its subject matter, just make sure you've taken your medication before you watch this lol.Joaquin Phoenix gives an Oscar winning performance! You could easily see him as a very menacing and honest Joker for any future 'dark' Batman movies and would definitely be a,if not THE highlight of those movies.It's going to be interesting to see someone better Joaquin Phoenix's Joker as this is the best yet. Even coming close would also be amazing to watch.Todd Philips and his team have done an fantastic and beautiful job of creating the world and vision that this Joker lives in.",10,2,4,7 October 2019
Incredibles 2," Not as GREAT as the critics have made out unfortunately.
","It was a good enough watch but as i was watching it i started to think that i would have preferred to have spent my cinema money and time on something else.It doesn't have that same all-encompassing magic and energy of other great Pixar films, it wasn't as fun, funny or wowing. The critics have overhyped this one, for me!It feels a bit lifeless at times cus it doesn't possess the originality of other Pixar greats in regards to story, character, dialog and scenery. There are a few action sequences which are cool but just not enough to rate it any higher.The family scenes are cliched, all too familiar, except for when the baby sporadically displays his powers like in the trailers.The reveal/twist at the end is predictable and lazy.It is no where near as good as most Marvel films and It's hard not to compare considering how they are equal in scale but this just isn't as fun, funny, engrossing or exciting as those. And i love Pixar movies in general.7.5/10",7,1,1,16 July 2018
Warcraft," Watchable but AVERAGE movie,Nothing New At All! Definitely No LOTR/Hobbit.
","I don't know anything about WOW or whatever this movie is based on. The trailer looked average, it didn't have anything different or too spectacular in it and could well be cheesy, but i went to see it anyway as i had a free ticket. My friend had seen it and told me it was rubbish but i still went in with an open mind because the reviews on here were VERY good and the box office seems to be really impressive as of right now, so i thought i'd go and see for myself as i like this genre.Anyway, the movie turned out to be average, a seen it all before thing. I wouldn't have paid to see this, the only redeeming parts for me were the fight scenes because im a sucker for action, but having said that, it isn't anything you haven't seen before and it has been done better. Without those parts i probably would have thought of walking out. Its not that much of a interesting story, boring in places, it isn't gracefuly told/made like the LOTR/Hobbit films i've seen,haven't seen all of those btw but they're the closest things i can compare this to. Travis Fimmel and Ben Foster gave cool performances though.I think this is maybe more for the fans of the Warcraft games and people who like these kind of movies that will settle for an average review. I love this genre of movie too but it needed to be better, there needed to be more to it, considering what we've had before with the likes of Harry Potter, LOTR! I've only seen the first of the Percy Jackson and Narnia films but Warcraft was as average as them i'd say, watchable but nothing i feel necessary to go back to.4/10",4,27,55,1 June 2016
Alien: Covenant," 2 Awful Alien Movies In A Row Now. Neill Blomkapt HEEEELP!!
","I'll get this out of the way first, i really enjoyed 1979's Alien and loved 1986's Aliens but i very much disliked Ridley Scott's sleep inducing 2012 film Prometheus!A couple of friends that loved Prometheus(ALARM BELLS) had assured me that this was nothing like that previous disaster. I also watched a fantastic documentary this week called Jodorowsky's Dune, about the making of a sci-fi movie called Dune that got cancelled by a nervous studio roughly a month before going into production in the mid 1970's. The script, storyboards, concept art, soundtrack collaborators and actors were all ready to go, on what seems like the most important project in Hollywood and film history, a real game changer! The visionary genius of Alejandro Jodorowsky assembled a team that was very against the typical Hollywood system of doing things and selected an bunch of leftfield creative artists to fulfil his vision for his sci-fi epic. I'm telling you this as it is HUGELY important to the Alien franchise and to science fiction cinema since. People should know that the reason Alien looks and feels the way it does is solely because of Jodorowsky's Dune project and so should be more commonly known and acknowledged. The team he put together, the storyboards and concept art that were created for Dune is basically what Alien, Blade Runner, Star Wars became. The studios were equally dazzled and scared about what Jodoowsky wanted to do with Dune and after it got cancelled the same studios hired HIS team to basically re- create(copy) what they had done with Dune for Alien and Blade Runner! Imagine if you will Alien and Blade Runner without that particular distinctive look and feel, it would have just looked and felt like any other 70s and early 80s sci-fi film and would possibly be forgotten like many of them now too.So what did i think of Alien Covenant...i thought WHAT a waste of time! We have basically been given the exact same film as Alien and Prometheus, absolutely nothing new or fresh, same story, same structure. Spaceship full of crew, they wake up, land on a strange planet, aliens kill or infect a few on the land, then a few on the ship and that's it, the end! If you want to see that then just watch the 1979 Alien again! Roughly the first hour of Alien Covenant was pretty low key, giving you a chance to drift off and think about what to eat once you leave the cinema or whatever pops into your head. From then it shifts a gear away from that plodding Prometheus style(that film NEVER shifted from neutral unfortunately) but just wasn't enough and felt lifeless. One slightly exciting action sequence that shifted it into 2nd gear lasted about 5 minutes and really didn't warrant the effort of putting the clutch down, in the whole scheme of things! The film was predictable because you've seen this whole scenario before and in a million other similar type films. I started checking my phone halfway through to see how long i had left to endure of this which isn't good. Someone had told me the visuals in Alien Covenant were amazing and to be witnessed at the cinema, absolutely NOT True, there was nothing you haven't seen before with many big budget movies of the last 20 so years. The film was not scary as some have said and what action it did have was not inventive and definitely not worth a trip to cinema for. What we have with Alien Covenant is exactly the same story, structure and look as Ridley Scott's previous 2 Alien films. After the public polarization of Prometheus I expected him to tread new ground with this movie, especially because he acknowledged THAT issue and said changes will be made with this instalment. The only change made was upping the tempo, which still doesn't warrant watching it or it even being made. It felt like a poor attempt at a slasher film with even worse character development, a very shallow and forgettable crew. If i had to score it i'd give Alien Covenant a 1 out of 10, which is 1 more than what i gave Prometheus as it's basically a copy and paste job. It felt like a poor attempt at a slasher film. I would therefore recommend waiting to see this at home, hopefully for free if you are an Alien fan but if you're not then never bother, or just watch the original 1979 Alien and it's amazing 1986 action packed sequel directed by James Cameron, Aliens.Ridley Scott should have stuck to his no-sequels policy because unfortunately he has done a MASSIVE smoking alien turd on his original 1979 film with Prometheus and now Alien Covenant. Leave the Alien franchise alone dude, it was doing much better without you. His last 4 films were equally bad or worse, besides Exodus which i enjoyed, so along with a bunch of his previous poor films it has led me to the conclusion that he was just at the right place at the right time with the 1979 Alien film. It was clearly the creative art department that the studio hired that truly made that film the visionary classic it became, along with Blade Runner, which btw also polarized its audience like Prometheus did with its storytelling, but was an undisputed classic in regards to its vision which we should all thank Alejandro Jodorowsky for! I would have preferred it if Ridley Scott had used the time spent making these 2 new Alien instalments making 2 original films instead. I'd rather have had a fresh take on another subject than 2 near identical re-runs of his first film!Neill Blomkamp..HEEEEEELP!!",1,9,16,18 June 2017
