Raiders of the Lost Ark," V.Good
","I really love all of the Indiana jones' movies. When i went to Disney world in Florida when i was 4 I saw a stunt out of this movie so the film always reminds me of that lol But anyway..I think Harrison ford is amazing as Indiana and I can't imagine any one else playing the part. He is so fit when hes got his shirt half undone and hes got his whip hehe. There are some great action scenes in this film and it will have you on the edge of your seat on some parts. I always worry that Indiana will end up being killed but it never happens just like Bond never gets killed...Hes too cute to kill. Any way...I would definitely recommend watching this film, It has a bit of everything, romance, action and comedy. Its great!",10,0,0,26 March 2006
