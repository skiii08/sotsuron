Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Better than people say!
","Okay so yes I do agree very much that Star Wars episode I The Phantom Menace will never be as stunning as other Star Wars films such as 'A New Hope, 'The Emipre Strikes Back, 'Return of the Jedi or 'Revenge of the Sith' which are all some of my favourite movies. However I do not believe that it is worthy of all the badmouthing it has received over these last lot of years by many critics. As regardless of some of the stuff it lacked in certain places I felt it made up for in other areas in the plot, acting and effects etc. Star Wars episode I The Phantom Menace told us the start of the saga involving two Jedi knights Qui-Gon Jinn(Liam Nesson) and Obi-Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor) who while on a mission to end the greedy trade federations blockade of the planet Naboo and restore peace to the Galatic Republic have to stop and have there starship repaired on the Hutt dictatorship planet of Tattoine, where they discover the young slave boy Anakin Shywalker who's dream is to one day fly away in a spaceship and train to become a great Jedi knight. Gui-Gon who believes strongly in young Skywalker chooses to take him with them back to the Jedi council to have him trained in the ways of the force, unaware that the path way he is taking will change him into the evil Sith lord we all now from the originals as Darth Vader. Another character that deserves a mention is Padme who was played perfectly by Nataile Portman. She is such a cute actress IMO.When I ask some of my friends why they disliked this film they usually blame it on the one same thing Jar Jar Binks, who I must say yes can be a bit annoying a lot of the time, although I must confess that I did find him rather hilarious in the battle between the Gungans and the federations droid armies. What I would say to people who hated The Phantom Menace due to Jar Jar is to just ignore him and not let him spoil the whole episode for you and concentrate on the rest of the story. The character who impressed me the most I would have to say is Qui-Gon Jinn due to the great acting from Liam Nesson who give yet another wonderful performance. Darth Maul was an excellent new villain and he, Gui-Gon and Obi-Wan have a great fight towards the end of the film, which has very good light sabre effects and is set in a rather interesting location. To be honest the only problems that I have with this movie are the pod race on Tattoine carrying on for a bit to long, the way it sometimes doesn't connect to the original trilogy very well in parts and there not being enough scenes with Darth Maul featured in them. Overall this movie is not perfect and by no means flawless. However I think it has been trolled enough over the years and its time to look for the more positive parts in the film which believe me do be come visible to your eyes once you watch it a certain number of times. Overall a Star Wars episode that is more good than it is bad ( Despite what others would tell you IMO ) I give episode one the Phantom Menace a well deserved 7/10 stars. Nothing beats ' The Empire Strikes Back ' though!",7,0,1,9 August 2005
The Big Lebowski," One of my Favourites!
","A victim of mistaken identity, Geoffrey (The Dude) Lebowski in advisably pursues recompense for the spoiling of his beloved rug after it is ruined by two brain-dead thugs who think he is the Pasadena millionaire of the same name.How on earth anyone could possibly have imagined that The Dude was a millionaire in the first place is a little beyond comprehension, but reason is not important when a movie is as profoundly funny and satisfying as this wee gem from the Coen brothers.Never before has Geoff Bridges fitted into a role so snugly, and it would perhaps be churlish to suggest that the character made it an easy role to play, as this would take something away from an outstanding performance from Bridges as the ageing, pacifist hippie.Perhaps he may have had better pure acting performances than this, but surely this was a role Bridges was born to play.The Dude's daily chores include trips to the supermarket to ensure he has fresh milk (which he opens and smells before buying) for his staple diet of White Russians.For Dude Lebowski is perhaps someone many of us aspire to be like.An ex-student activist turned ten-pin bowling pacifist, The Dude endeavours to take it easy for as much as possible and one fells if it wasn't for the destabilising influence of his best friend - Vietnam Veteran and Vietnam - obsessed Walter - he sure would.On Walter's (John Goodman) suggestion The Dude decides to visit his namesake millionaire (The Big Lebowski of the film title) and ask for compensation for his ruined piece of carpet, after all, 'It really tied the room together'.It soon becomes clear that The Dude should have settled for a smelly rug and gone bowling.After initially rudely rejecting his request for the compensation the wheelchair-bound Big Lebowski,through the good offices of his attendant - the snivelling and cowering Brandt - forgives The Dude for stealing a rug from the mansion and offers to pay him 20,000 dollars to act as courier when his wife is kidnapped by a gang of motley German nihilists. Really clever plot!What follows is predictable enough, in that the Dude and Walter become embroiled in a sequence of events which become increasingly bizarre as they fail to deliver the One Million dollar ransom.What is not predictable is the bizarre characters that the Dude encounters along the way that make this comedy so much more endearing than most.Another character that deserves a mention is Donny, the hapless member of the trio who passes almost unnoticed but this is nevertheless another good piece of work from this really good actor Steve Buscemi.So Overall this is a fine piece of work by the two Coen brothers and is one of my favourite movies I saw it when I was 13 years old and was blown away with laugher from watching this great comedy.I would suggest to all fans of Coen brothers or good comedy to see it.So The Big Lebowski deserves a full 9/10 stars. WATCH IT NOW!!",10,1,2,20 March 2005
American History X," One of the most powerful movies ever made!
","American History X is one of the most important films of are generation which tells us about the true horrors of racial prejudice(from both white and black citizens) that still goes on in our world today. In the state of California a young Neo-Nazi skinhead called Derek Vinyard(Edward Norton) is arrested and jailed for the violent killings of two coloured men who were trying to steal his van. Then while serving his sentence Vinyard slowly begins to realise just how wrong he was to do all the savage things he did. Derek vows that on the day of his realise he shall be a reformed man and is determined to save his younger brother Danny(Edward Furlong) from adopting to the same life style he had once lead due to the fact that he has already fallen under the influence of Cameron Alexander the older man who had convinced Derek to set up the white power movement that he use to lead, while destroying shops in their area which were owned by foreign businessmen. The story is very well written and makes it easy to understand all the characters. The ending is a bit of a shocker but still powerful as it remains us that every racial group on this earth can be racist not just the while people. Edward Norton's acting as Derek Vinyard in this movie was legendary and easily his best performance so far, passing Fight Club by miles in my opinion. I here he was up for an occur back in 1998 for his role in American History X and was only denied it due to all the controversial scenes in the movie, which I fell was a real shame as he really deserved it much more that anyone else that year. Edward Furlong is also excellent in his role as Danny Vinyard and was a really good narrator throughout the film. The rest of the cast which included Avery Brooks, Ethan Suplee, Fairuza Balk and Stacy Keach are also terrific.This movie is one of the best and most powerful pieces of acting I've ever seen in my life and I'm actually quite surprised its only ranked at number 60 instead of in the IMDb top 20, but oh well I guess popularity polls can never be the exact why you would wish them to be. Anyway this movie has lots of important lessons to teach its viewer and I would suggest everyone to watch it. I overall give American History X a definite 10/10 stars.",10,0,0,19 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Easily the best of the Star Wars Prequels!
","Revenge of the Sith was an excellent movie which I saw in the cinema last night. In this chapter of the Star Wars stories the director Geogre Lucas tells us the part of the tale to which the evil Sith villain Darth Vader had first came into being. Hayden Christensen takes the main roll in the film as the confused young Jedi warrior Anakin sky-walker who due to fear for the well fare of his loved ones but particularly his girl the beautiful Padme(Natalie Portman), becomes rapped up into a strange series of events which leads him to realise just what sort of part he will play toward the future of the democratic republic. This movie also stars Ewan McGregor as Skywalker's brave Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi who tries very hard to stop him from turning to the dark side throughout the movie. These two do a great job working together. However they are both completely over shadowed by the great Ian McDiarmid who is simply outstanding as the evil Chancellor Palpatine. He is a very experienced actor and understands his role well due to already staring in some films of the classic original Star Wars trilogy namely the Return of the Jedi. I also loved the Yoda Vs Palpatine/Darth Sidious light sabre battle I thought it was breathtaking. However even though this episode of Star Wars is still not quite as spectacular as the three original episodes from the 1980's which along with The Lord of the Rings are two of the greatest fantasy trilogy's ever to be made, this is still a extremely worthy addition to the series by the talented writer and director George Lucas and has still became one of my favourite films. Revenge of the Sith is a very Superior film compared to the other two previous Star Wars prequels. This one brought back the dark fell to the movies atmosphere of all the older ones which was needed. Although I must admit that I did really enjoy episode one The Phantom Menace quite a lot, I now it was a little light hearted compared to normal Star Wars but Liam Nesson was excellent in his role as Obi-wan's Jedi master(I thought so) and Darth Maul was a pretty cool character. I thought episode two Attack of the Clones wasn't the best or as gripping when you compare it to all the other Star Wars films. However I still found episode two very much watchable and it certainly wasn't all pointless. Overall I think the prequel's were still very much necessary to the series and I'm glad Lucas made them in order to reveal to us what caused the future events in the older episodes. If Darth Vader had have featured more in the newer ones maybe they could have been as stunning as their originals. Revenge of the Sith was without doubt the strongest of the new Star Wars movies and I think it will always be remembered for that reason. The Empire Strikes Back shall always be my favourite Star Wars film though. I overall give Revenge of the Sith a very well deserved 10/10 stars.",10,2,8,26 June 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Good but overrated
","First of all I am by no means a Shawshank hater nor I'm I here to troll the film or its fans for it being ranked this high on the IMDb top 250. Shawshank I must say is a rather enjoyable watch with a decent performance from Tim Robbins, a particular good one from Morgan Freeman, a decent storyline and a nice ending. However that said I would not put it anywhere near my top 50 movies list and I'm pretty sure I could name at least 30 films, twenty of which are not even ranked in the 250 that are IMO way better than Shawshank in their use of story telling and making you study them in your head even after you've watched them many times. It would perhaps be safe to say that what ever it does for many other people it just didn't do for me. The story was fairly predictable from start to finish and although I did appreciate its ending I found it to be too much your typical Hollywood sort of ending where every things happy and all loose ends have been tied up etc. I've now seen this movie four times and I must say I still find it to be very overrated, when I see it voted number two of all time then I think of how there are so many other movies out there not even in the 250. Oh well I guess popularity polls can never be just the way one would like them to be. Overall I give The Shawshank Redemption 6/10 stars I would have given it a seven or a eight only with the amount of high votes and rankings its got over the years on this site, I just felt it wasn't in need of such charity. As stated above a very enjoyable prison drama but just nowhere near in the same league as The Godfather, Star Wars and The Lord of the Rings trilogies. But hey thats only my opinion and thats what makes us all different isn't it?",6,1,6,15 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The best of this brilliant Trilogy!
","At Last Frodo and Sam's long and deadly journey to destroy the one ring comes to an end as they reach Mordor in this outstanding work of art by Peter Jackson. Aragorn the true good king of Gondor has taken his place as the king and became who he was born to be in order to defend his people from the evil dark lords growing armies with the help of the land of Rohan and Gandalf the White wizard. The battle scenes at Minas Tirith are by far the most ingenious peace of film making I've ever had the joy to view in my life of movie watching. Back to the hobbits Frodo and Sam. I have to say that Gollum is great in this film as we get to see his true love and passion for the ring and what evil things he can really do just to steal it back for himself. As he leads Frodo and Sam to the lair of the giant spider Shelob, which was also done perfectly in filming. Also I loved the way we found out about Gollum's past life and how he first came upon the evil of the one ring in the opening scenes of the movie. The music is Fab! I own the soundtrack on CD. The ending is very happy but at the same time heartbreaking and very unforgettable. This is a must see movie watch it as soon as you can and if you have already seen it then watch it again as it only gets better every time you view this work of art. This film has to get 10/10 stars. Truly Outstanding!! I would just like to give my special thanks to the writer and creator of Lord of the Rings JRR Tolkien for making these excellent movies possible by giving us such a classic series of novels as inspiration. This epic easily deserves its 3rd place in the top 250 films on IMDb any day. The Return of the King has now become my favourite movie of all time and to me this is the greatest masterpiece ever made in film history.Oh and in fact I would say that this film along with the other two parts of the LOTR trilogy are ten times better than the Godfather trilogy!",10,2,4,29 October 2004
