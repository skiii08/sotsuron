The Blair Witch Project," It was different than most 'horror' movies.
","I recently went and saw this film, and the only word I could think of to describe what I thought about it was that it was different.  I think that there is a big difference between scary and and gory.  I would catagorize this film as scary with a bit of comedy. It does give a good example of how you don't have to see a bunch of blood and guts to be scared.  Personally, I don't think that movies filled with blood and gore are not at all scary, I think there sick and disgusting.  I honestly found this film more funny than scary though. I think that all the hype around it was a bit much, but I do admit that if it weren't for all the hype I probably would have never seen it.  Finally, I probably would not pay to see it again, but it wasn't a waste of my money to see it once.",7,1,2,15 August 1999
