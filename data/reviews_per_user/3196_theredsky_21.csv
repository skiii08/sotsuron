Ford v Ferrari," Ford v Ferrari review
","This was a lot better than I thought it was going to be although I had some issues that held this film from being really good. The first 30-45 minutes were just uninteresting to me. It was well acted but there was nothing that was keeping me interested. Once we get to the point where they are modifying the car, it gets pretty great. Christian Bale and Matt Damon do great jobs but Bale steals the show. Bale is perfectly cast and is fantastic as this angry race car driver. Both Damon and Bale have perfect chemistry and play off well with each other thanks to a pretty good script although not a perfect one. Most of the other actors did a pretty good job also. There is also some good chemistry between Bale and Noah Jupe who plays Bale's son. They also have some genuinely touching moments together. The only character I didn't like was Jon Bernthal's character. I thought he was extremely one dimensional and irritating. I thought the racing sequences in the film were fantastic. They are incredibly well shot and paced. Even though the film is based on true events, I still felt exhilarated and was on the edge of my seat. The Le Mans sequence was one of the best sequences in film that I saw so far this year. The sound mixing is pretty great also. It immerses you within the races which makes those sequences so much better. I felt the last 10 minutes of the film was pointless. I thought the film was gonna end after this desert scene that I won't spoil but it kept going on. The music was also pretty bland. Even after just seeing the film, I don't remember any of the music. Some of the other technical aspects that I liked was the cinematography. During the racing scenes, it was great and during the rest of the film, it was pretty good. The film has a couple visual effects scenes that I thought looked pretty good. Overall, Ford v Ferrari is a pretty good film with great racing sequences, great acting, and some good cinematography even if the first 30 minutes and last 10 minutes were generally uninteresting.",7,0,1,17 November 2019
Rocketman," Rocketman Review
","This is a great movie. Rocketman is everything Bohemian Rhapsody should have been. Here are the very few negatives to this film. Some of the family drama does feel kinda forced. It doesn't take a lot away from the experience but it does feel odd. Some elements of the film are not entirely accurate. One such thing would be that the 'John' in Elton John's name did not come from John Lennon. Rocketman had very few inaccuracies unlike Bohemian Rhapsody where they changed parts of Freddie Mercury's life to fit a story. The film does start to hit the same beats as every other musical biopic out there. Here are the positives. The acting is phenomenal. Taron Egerton does an outstanding job as Elton John. He embodies so much emotion into his performance and he is an outstanding singer. I am confident in thinking that Egerton's performance could be a possible Oscar nomination. Jamie Bell and Bryce Dallas Howard both do an outstanding job as the people who Elton cares about. Richard Madden does a great job as a manager and also the 'villain' of the story. Even the child actors who portrayed a young Elton John do a great job. The musical numbers in this film are amazing. Each musical number has its own visual flare. They keep your interest and get the other characters and surrounding extras involved. Unlike Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman's musical scenes are intriguing. Costume Design and Set Design are also really good in this film. The costumes look almost exactly like the actual costumes Elton John wore. The sets just look amazing. The tone for the film remains consistent and the film is paced really well also. The narrative for this film is great. The film focuses on Elton's John musical skills, alcoholism, and drug abuse. Bohemian Rhapsody barely focuses on the effects of Mercury's drug abuse while Rocketman shows the effects of what happens with these substances. The film's structure is great. The story is told from Elton John while he is therapy and ends with him overcoming his problems.. While I do thoroughly like Bohemian Rhapsody, Rocketman is 100% the superior film. Overall, Rocketman provides amazing performances, outstanding musical numbers, and great costume design. I give Rocketman a 9/10.",8,13,27,12 June 2019
Knives Out," Knives Out Review
","If I were to briefly describe Knives Out, then it would be constantly engaging and entertaining. If you were not a big fan of The Last Jedi then I urge you to check this film out and see that Rian Johnson is a more capable director when he is working on his own. It's a film with issues that are minor and were the only issues I had with the film. The film does have some political subtext to it which I liked but there were some areas where it was a little on the nose. It didn't take me out of the movie but I wished it had been handled a little better. This movie has a bunch of A-list actors and they all bring their A-game. Every performance in this movie is pretty great but Daniel Craig, Chirs Evans, and Ana de Armas steal every scene they are in. It can be a little hard to get used to Craig's heavy southern drawl at first but you eventually get used to it. Chris Evans is a nice counterweight to everyone's craziness. I felt he was one of the funniest characters in the movie except for one joke. Ana de Armas is a great protagonist to follow throughout the film along with Daniel Craig. All 3 of them disappear into their roles and portray their characters almost perfectly. It's a great redemption film for Chris Evans from Red Sea Diving Resort. The script is pretty great. There are tons of clues hidden beneath each line of dialogue and it all feels very natural. This allows for Johnson's comedic writing to shine. He is able to cleverly insert jokes that most of the time are pretty hilarious. The reason the comedy didn't work that well in The Last Jedi for me was that it felt forced and didn't always align well with the tone but the comedy shines here because it fits the film's tone perfectly. While not every joke is hilarious, a majority of them are. The jokes that go along with certain characters fit their character pretty well. Some of the funniest lines in the movie are delivered by Michael Shannon and Daniel Craig because the jokes they tell perfectly fit their characters. The story is fairly simple but Rian Johnson throws a lot of simple twists throughout that makes it feels unique. The film decides to reveal what actually happened to the victim halfway through the film and it turns into a cover up which then progresses to a pretty major twist that I never saw coming but felt necessary and made sense to the narrative. The music was also pretty good. It added tension and was interesting to listen to while the events unfolded. Overall, Knives Out is a great murder mystery with great performances, a great script, hilarious jokes, and some interesting twists.",9,3,7,13 December 2019
The Irishman," The Irishman Review
","Martin Scorsese is still at the top of his game even after directing for more than 50 years. This is one of my favorite Scorsese films that he has directed behind Goodfellas and Taxi Driver. This film came so close to becoming a masterpiece if it wasn't for the first 30 minutes being a little too confusing. It was a little hard to understand what was going on but I eventually caught on to what was happening. There is not one bad performance in this film. Every actor brings their A-game especially Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, and Al Pacino. Each of them is incredible in their roles and adds many different layers to their respective characters but I felt Joe Pesci did the best job. He made Russell Bufalino seem like an intimidating but kind character that was always intriguing to watch. Robert De Niro made his character, Frank Sheeran, seem like a hardcore badass who didn't make enough time for his family and Al Pacino made Jimmy Hoffa feel like a kind yet hotheaded and naive man. The script and de aging effects done on these characters is great also. Most films that use de aging and aging effects don't like that great in the light but Martin Scorsese found a way to make it look really good. The actors make these effects even better. When they are made to look younger, the actors use their physical performance to look younger and the same when they are aged to look older. They use their physical performance to make themselves feel older. Even though the movie is 3 and a half hours long, I never felt the runtime. The story is always investing even when it is confusing. I was never bored throughout the course of the film. The last hour of the film was fantastic. If you have seen the trailers then you know the film has Jimmy Hoffa in it played by Al Pacino and the last hour 'deals' with him. It's beautifully executed and acting and the final scene is heartbreaking yet intriguing. Although this is far from Scorsese's first look at mobsters and gangsters, this film does enough that is unique to differentiate itself from his other works. The soundtrack choices were great and fit the tone of the film pretty well and all the other technical aspects were done pretty well. Overall, The Irishman is yet again another great look at mobsters with fantastic performances, a compelling story, and fantastic direction from Martin Scorsese.",9,1,3,1 December 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," Star Wars Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker Review
","I've always been a fan of Star Wars. The Original Trilogy is almost perfect and the Prequels are hilariously bad but the Sequel Trilogy has been pretty mediocre so far. So how does this final film wrap up the ENTIRE Skywalker Saga? Meh, very messy and mostly disappointing. If you like fan service or huge battles then you will probably love this but I was looking for a good story with good characters and the film mostly doesn't deliver on that level. The only new character I liked that has been consistently good throughout the entire trilogy is Kylo Ren. He is the only new character to go through an actual arc throughout the trilogy about who he is while the others haven't really gone through one. Finn had one in the first film but that was completely abandoned by this film. Rey and Poe haven't gone through any arc but I like Poe as a character more than Rey. The Original Trilogy characters are fine. They already completed their arcs and are here to help these new characters but I have a problem with one of them, Palpatine. Although I enjoyed his presence and Ian McDiarmid did a great job as usual, he really doesn't serve any purpose to the story other than to be there. It feels like a last minute decision to throw him into the film and I felt that this wasn't their original goal. Leia's presence was awkward in a few places but I can't fault the film for that because they did the best they could out of a bad situation. The new characters for this film only weren't that good either. They were introduced, used for the characters to get out of a situation or get into something and then were abandoned until the end. They really weren't fleshed out a lot and felt useless. The first hour of the film was incredibly clumsy, messy, and at some points confusing. The film slowly got better as time went along but it didn't get that much better. The first hour is our group of heros hopping from planet to planet and delivering exposition. That's it. The editing was really choppy and quick along with the transitions. Some scenes would switch to another character for a minute or less and then hop back to our core three characters. It felt awkward and very rushed which completely destroyed the pacing for the rest of the film because the rest of the film has much slower pacing. The film tries to fit a LOT of information into its 2 and a half hour runtime where it feels like the film should have been 3 and a half or 4 hours to fit all this information. The film introduced a new force power that was stupid to me. It felt like the writers wrote themselves into a corner and used this new force ability as a way to get out. The final climactic battle was kinda cool but it wasn't that impressive to me. In fact, most of the action wasn't that special compared to some of the other action scenes in the other films. The battle between Rey and Kylo over the ocean was kinda cool but most of the other action scenes felt uninspired. The acting for the most part was pretty great. Adam Driver did a great job and so did the Original Trilogy characters. Although I wasn't a big fan of their characters, Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, and Oscar Issac did a pretty good job. As always, the music by John Williams is fantastic. This man can never screw up Star Wars music. The visuals are pretty great also. The planets looked great and so did the ships and action sequences. Some of the alien creatures were practical which I felt was a really nice touch. I really enjoyed and appreciated some of the fan service moments. I won't spoil any of them for you but I had a smile on my face when those moments happened. Overall, The Rise of Skywalker is a disappointing ending to the Skywalker Saga with choppy editing, transitions, uninspired action, and rushed story but retains its good acting, visuals, and music with some good fan service moments to leave viewers happy.",5,7,11,26 December 2019
The Conjuring 2," The Conjuring 2 Review
","This is by far the best film in the Conjuring Universe so far. It's suspenseful and creepy. Let me get some negatives out of the way. There were some shaky cam moments in the beginning of the film that made no sense story wise. 2 of the 4 child actors weren't that good but what do you expect from child actors. The night scenes in the house in the first half of the film were too dark just like the original Conjuring movie but James Wan fixes this halfway through the movie. Now let's get onto the positives. The main cast and most of the supporting cast did an outstanding job in their respective roles within the film. Ed and Lorraine Warren were given better story arcs than the first film. The cinematography was great throughout the film and had some really nice tracking shots that weren't too long and weren't too short. The tone remained consistent throughout the film and the plot was pretty good. I understood what was going on throughout the entire film. The demons in this movie are flat out creepy. The Nun got me every time it was on screen and the Crooked Man's design was great. I swear they used stop motion animation for the Crooked Man. If they did, then they blended his character really well with the live action scenes. The scenes with both those demons added suspense and terror to an already terrifying film. Overall, The Conjuring 2 improves from most of the mistakes from the original film while adding better cinematography, a better supporting cast, and scarier demons.",8,0,1,20 April 2019
Yesterday," Yesterday Review
","This is a decent movie that I thoroughly enjoyed. Here are the negatives. Just like Ma and Brightburn, the concept of the film is really good but it isn't explored enough. You want to know more but it decides to focus on more character drama. Ed Sheeran is not the best actor in the world and he just looks incredibly awkward in this film. In most scenes he is in, it looks like he is incredibly confused. Another aspect would be that there are a lot of plotholes thrown into this film that when you notice them, it starts to take you out of the experience. The editing for this film is not good at all. There are too many cuts for some scenes and scenes just keep cutting away every 2-3 seconds when it shouldn't. The camera angles are so obnoxious in some scenes that it is distracting. Some scenes are tilted at a 45 degree angle for no apparent reason at all and it is just annoying. The humor is not that funny at all and I only chuckled one joke throughout the entire film. I'm not huge on Kate McKinnon as the primary antagonist in this movie. She just feels out of place surrounded by everyone else. Here are the positives. Himesh Patel and Lily James do a great job and have great chemistry together. Patel's performance is actually really good. He gives a ton of emotion, he's a good singer, and he knew what he was doing. Most of the supporting cast does a good job with what they are given. I was surprised about how much heart there was in this film. You genuinely care about the experiences they go through. There is one particular scene that I feel is very very touching. Patel's character is given an address and he drives to this secluded location where he knocks on the door and John Lennon answers it. He gives some inspirational words to Patel's character and it is very nice, emotional, and touching. The new renditions of The Beatles songs is actually pretty good. I enjoyed listening to them a lot. The cinematography is good in most areas but it is not special. The tone remains consistent throughout the entire film and it's also paced really well. Overall, Yesterday is a great Beatles love letter with lots of heart, good acting, and interesting renditions of good songs but is held back by major plot holes, poor editing, weird casting choices, and an underexplored premise. I give Yesterday a 6/10.",6,1,3,7 July 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Avengers: Endgame Review
","This is an amazing film. I love almost every aspect of this film. As a Marvel fan, I can definitely say that Avengers: Endgame is a love letter to the fans and provides a satisfying emotional conclusion. Let's get some negatives out of the way. Everything up until the Time Heist drags on and starts to get boring. I know that they need to set everything up for the 2nd and 3rd acts of the film but I wish they had done it better. The 2nd and 3rd acts of this film make up for this though. I also didn't like the explanation for the their time travel. The film basically states that anything the characters do in the past doesn't affect the future which makes no sense at all. I know that this is their own rule but it just makes no sense at all. Why would changing the past not affect the future at all. That would mean that Nebula would have disappeared when she killed her past self. The one other problem is that some of the jokes didn't work. The positives far outweigh the negatives though. The cast does an outstanding job especially all of the main Avengers. I loved watching them together with War Machine, Nebula, and Rocket. All the supporting characters also did an amazing job. The plot can get confusing sometimes but generally, it's understandable. The tone remains consistent throughout the film. It's sometimes funny when it needs to be funny and it's serious when it needs to be serious. The cinematography was fine. It wasn't anything special. The visual effects for this film are amazing though. The armies look mostly real and Thanos looks great as always. There is a lot of emotional weight to this film which kinda surprised me. I was expecting Hawkeye to die but I was generally surprised and sad when they killed off Black Widow. I was really sad when they killed Iron Man. I knew they were but I didn't know how they would kill him. It was incredibly satisfying to hear Iron Man say 'I am Iron Man' one last time. His death is sad but satisfying. The funeral scene at the end of the film was so awesome and brought back some characters we haven't seen for a long time. The action in this film is probably the best in the MCU. The climactic battle at the end is in my opinion the best action scene in all of cinema. Captain America wielding Mjolnir was so awesome to watch. Personally, I loved the ending for Captain America. He got to live the life he never lived. Overall, Avengers: Endgame is a satisfying conclusion to the first 22 films in the MCU while boosting a very strong cast, some amazing action, and an immensely satisfying conclusion. I give Avengers: Endgame a 9.5/10.",8,0,4,3 May 2019
Toy Story 4," Toy Story 4 Review
","Toy Story 4 is an outstanding film that succeeds in keeping the Toy Story Franchise one of the best franchises. Here are the few negatives. The character of Forky, as great as he is, is a plot device. He really is only there to move the story forward which kinda sucks. My other issue is that the film does borrow heavily on themes and plot points from the original 3 films. Here are the positives. This film can be very emotional at times. The film starts emotional and doesn't stop being emotional until the credits roll. The last scene of the film is probably one of the most emotional Pixar moments. The voice acting is very good. Tom Hanks, Tim Allen, and Annie Potts are standouts from the main cast. Each delivers their lines with so much emotion and personality that you can't help but care about them and their struggles. The returning characters don't have a lot of screen time but they all do an outstanding job. The new characters are really good also. Keanu Reeves, Jordan Peele, and Keegan-Michael Key's characters steal the show. Each of their characters are incredibly entertaining and hilarious to watch on the big screen. This leads me to my next point. For a Pixar film, Toy Story 4 is pretty funny. There are a handful of jokes that don't land well but most of them got a chuckle out of me and one or two got full on laughs from me. The animation for this film is outstanding. It's incredible to see how far animation has come from the original Toy Story in 1995. There is one shot that showcases the passage of time and it's incredible. The story is heartwarming and nice even if it does bounce back on ideas from the previous films. The score for this film is pretty good also. It's not extraordinary but it's good. The tone for the film remains consistent all the way through and it's also paced really well. I would highly recommend seeing this in theaters. Overall, Toy Story 4 is another great addition to the Toy Story franchise with outstanding animation, great voice acting, and tons of emotion. I give Toy Story 4 a 9/10.",8,2,7,3 July 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Once Upon a Time in Hollywood Review
","This was kind of a disappointment for me. Don't get me wrong, I still like the film but it just wasn't as great as I was hoping it would be. Here are the negatives. The film is structured weirdly which leads to the film being paced weirdly. Some scenes just kind of cut away to a flashback. One scene features Bruce Lee and Brad Pitt's character but you realize it is a flashback and it feels off. The film then montages through 6 months with narration. It feels out of place in this film and takes a little bit of interest out of the film. The scenes with Margot Robbie are kind of pointless. They don't serve to move the story forward. The film just comes to a dead stop when she appears on screen. For a Quentin Tarentino film, it is just a tad bit too long. Since the film is long, at some point in the second act, you start to feel a little bored which isn't a good thing for a Tarentino film. Here are the positives. The acting is phenomenal. Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt do fantastic jobs in their roles and have amazing chemistry together. DiCaprio has an especially hard job of playing the role of Rick Dalton and playing the characters that Rick Dalton plays. It's genuinely impressive.Margot Robbie, even though most of her scenes are pointless, also does a fantastic job. Even all of the supporting characters who are only on screen for a short amount of time do a great job. There is not one bad performance. The story can be a little confusing at times but it's mostly easy to follow. The film is more of a character study of DiCaprio's character and Pitt's characters rather than a plot driven story which is refreshing. The ending of the film, without going into spoilers is so awesome and shocking that you are sitting there with either this huge grin on your face or you are about to throw up. The dialogue feels natural mainly because it is a Tarantino film. The soundtrack is fantastic and uses some really good songs from the late 60's. The production design is fantastic. Tarantino managed to make every aspect of the film feel like 1969 even down to the costumes and vehicles. The film is actually pretty funny too. There are a bunch of moments in the film where I was laughing a lot. The cinematography is good and there are a couple of really good shots and transitions. The film's tone remains fairly consistent. Overall, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood may be a little too long and weirdly structured but showcases fantastic performances, great characters, and great production design while still showing that Tarantino is one of the greatest directors in Hollywood. I give Once Upon a Time in Hollywood an 8/10.",8,26,50,27 July 2019
Aladdin," Aladdin Review
","I tried to like this movie but I couldn't. Disney Live Action remakes just aren't good. All the Live Action remakes are only made for money. They bank too heavily on nostalgia which I don't like. I feel that this movie should not have been made. I feel the same way about any Live Action remake that has been released or is coming out. Here are some positives. Most of the cast does a good job. Will Smith isn't trying to beat out Robin Williams as the Genie but still does a great job. The soundtrack is decent. It's still incredibly catchy but not as catchy as the original. The only song I feel that is better in this movie is Arabian Nights. All the other songs are good but not as outstanding as the original. Unfortunately, the negatives outweigh the positives. The pacing of this film is way off. It feels rushed at certain points and the end of the film starts to drag and it takes too long. It also doesn't help that this film is 38 minutes longer than the original. Marwan Kenzari is a decent actor but he didn't do a good job in this film. In my opinion, he didn't know what to do with the character. Jafar never felt like a major threat during the film which is a problem because he is the main villain. There were some changes that were made to the story but I felt they really didn't work for me. Jasmine's added character arc was a big meh for me. It felt a little out of place within the narrative. The new songs they added were meh for me. They aren't as memorable as the other songs in the film. The effects on the Genie are still as bad as they were in the trailer which was very distracting. The film is very brightly lit which makes it feel like a Disney Channel Original Film. There are also some slow motion scenes that come out of nowhere and make no sense at all. Overall, Aladdin may have a half decent score but fails to capture the magic of the original film. I give Aladdin a 2/10.",2,147,265,14 July 2019

The Lion King," The Lion King (2019) Review
","What a pathetic, unnecessary, crappy cash grab. Don't get me wrong, I love the original film a lot and I like Jon Faverou but both don't mix well together. Here are the few positives. Obviously the film looks visually impressive but that leads to some problems later. Most of the voice cast does a fine job. Especially Donald Glover, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, and John Oliver. That's where the positives end. Here are the negatives. This is essentially a shot for shot remake of the original film. There is almost nothing new except a new song which is played in the background and extended scenes of pointless scenery and a single piece of Simba's hair flying across the desert. I give some credit to the other live action remakes for at least trying to do something different, even if they didn't work but this film does almost nothing new at all. It played it safe which was the wrong direction. Some of the voice acting isn't great. James Earl Jones sounds like he wasn't even trying. It sounds like he recorded all of his lines in one take and then went home. Chiwetel Ejiofor makes Scar seem like a pathetic loser. He just fails to capture that spine tingling and energetic performance of Jeremy Irons. The songs besides Circle of Life and Can You Feel the Love Tonight just are underwhelming especially Be Prepared which for some reason was cut short. The musical score is fine but it feels like they just copy and pasted the score from the original instead of making new renditions of the score. Even if the CGI is impressive, it also serves to the film's detriment. You can't relate to the characters because the visual effects don't allow them to convey any emotion. An example would be Mufasa's death. The actor voicing young Simba does a good job conveying his grief with his voice but Simba literally has a blank stare on his face the entire time. This is a problem throughout the entire film. The animals express almost no emotions. That's the beauty of the animation style of the original. Because it was animated, the animators had free liberty to make the animals express in whatever way they wanted. Another problem would be that some of the more important moments are shorter in this film than the original. The stampede scene was about 5 minutes while in this one it feels shorter which is odd because the film is almost 30 minutes longer than the original. This all begs the question. What was the point of this film? Obviously money but there's no point to the film. It's just the same thing that is somehow almost 30 minutes longer. Overall, The Lion King is visually impressive but fails at recapturing the beauty, scope, and emotional weight of the original animated film. I give The Lion King (2019) a 1/10.",1,114,179,21 July 2019
Midsommar," Midsommar Review
","Midsommar has stapled A24 as my favorite production and distribution studio. Midsommar is one of those weird movies where I don't really have any issues with the film but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but it is just shy of being one. The acting is pretty fantastic from everybody. Florence Pugh and Will Poulter are amazing in this movie while everybody else did a great job. Pugh's performance though was genuinely terrifying. What her character goes through and how she ends up at the end of the film is intriguing to watch. The script definitely helps these performances. It's very clever and well written and adds many different layers to this film. The cinematography is pretty great too. Each shot has a purpose and adds to the story and most of the shots are colorful and vibrant while the film has an incredibly dark tone and story. There are a lot of shots of some random things that come back into play later which I appreciated. There were also many great sequences. There is a dream sequence that was great and a sequence where the female characters have a dancing contest/ritual which was also great. Watching these characters watch and participate in different rituals was terrifying and the film isn't afraid to show everything and I mean everything. The film is incredibly gory and there were moments in this film where I was genuinely horrified by what I was witnessing. This is a film that will stick in your mind long after you watch it. Ari Aster definitely nailed it when it came to making a truly uncomfortable film. I really enjoyed the sets and colors they decided to use. It made the film look really pretty while all this really horrible stuff was going on. There was a temple set that looks absolutely beautiful. Overall, Midsommar may not be a masterpiece but its great acting, fantastic cinematography, and disturbing story make this film come so close to being one.",8,1,4,26 November 2019
The King," The King Review
","The King is a pretty bland and forgettable Netflix movie. Just because it is bland and forgettable does not mean I would call this a bad movie. There are elements that I did appreciate. I thought Robert Pattinson did a great job and I felt that his character was interesting even with the small amount of screentime. Timothee Chalamet started giving a pretty good performance in the second half of the film and Joel Edgerton did good most of the time. The sets were pretty great and looked authentic to the time period. This is the same for the makeup and costumes. The costume design is the only aspect of the film I felt was fantastic. There are a handful of good shots and a single good piece of music and I think the 3rd act battle scene is well done. My biggest issue with the film is that it isn't presented in a unique or interesting way. In short, the film doesn't stand out. The cinematography is pretty bland and uninspired for the most part. Besides one or two shots, I don't remember most of the scenes. The music is pretty bland and sounds a lot like stock music for the most part. The acting from everyone else ranges from decent to bad. None of the acting besides most of Chalamet's performance and Pattinson's performance was that great and was mostly passable. The script is pretty weak in most areas and the story generally isn't that interesting. I was bored for a majority of the film. I'm most likely going to forget about this film before the end of the year. Overall, The King is not a bad movie but it doesn't do anything to make it stand out from anything else I've seen this year.",5,4,6,10 November 2019

","In a year full of mediocre films and some mediocre comic book films, Joker is a HUGE breath of fresh air. Joker is a fantastic film and a fantastic comic book film. Although the film is great, there are a small handful of issues. Unfortunately, most of those issues are spoiler related so I can't talk about them. The one I can talk about is that the film does sometimes borrow a little too much from the films it is inspired by, Taxi Driver (1976) and The King of Comedy (1983). If you have seen either of those films and watch Joker then you will know what I am talking about. Other than that and my spoiler related issues, the film is almost perfect. Joaquin Phoenix does a phenomenal job as the Joker. You can barely recognize that it is him because he just disappears into this role. The way Joaquin Phoenix shows this slow downfall of his character is incredible. Robert De Niro also does a fantastic job with his limited role. He's cold, calculating, and manipulative and it's perfect. The sequence of events that the film portrays is perfect. It doesn't quickly get to the 'Joker' but spends most of the film showing the slow downfall of his character. The film does this to perfection. This film is incredibly dark. There are multiple moments in the film that your jaw just drops at what happens. The film uses violence to its advantage. The scenes where it is used in adds to the already huge amount of tension that has been built up which leads me to my next point, Joker is incredibly tense. There are multiple moments where events are slowly building up and you are just on the edge of your seat waiting for the climax of that scene and when it happens, it feels super satisfying. The score for this film is amazing also. Hildur Guðnadóttir has so many outstanding compositions that adds to the tension and gives us an insight into Arthur's mind. The cinematography is surprisingly really good. It always provides a way to show us how Arthur is feeling while also getting other necessary shots. Joker is a film that has to be experienced on its own. Ignore the controversy behind it and try not to pay too much attention to the critic reviews. You have to see the film and depending on how you feel the film portrays issues like violence and mental illness will determine if you like it or not. Overall, Joker is exactly what comic book films needed with a breathtaking performance from Joaquin Phoenix and an interesting, dark, and realistic approach into an iconic character. I give Joker a 9.5/10.",6,5,10,5 October 2019
It Chapter Two," It: Chapter 2 Review
","It: Chapter 2 is one of if not the most entertaining film I have seen this year. There are so many laugh out loud moments in this film and that's both good and bad. Compared to the 2017 film, Chapter 2 is not great on a technical level but it's far superior on an entertainment level. Here are the negatives. The film does overstay its welcome. The runtime is 2 hours and 45 minutes long and you definitely start to feel that.There are certain elements that could have been removed from the film and it would have been better. The ending of the film is not that good either. It does a rapid tone shift after the climax which just feels off putting to what we just encountered. The visual effects are pretty bad. There are many different forms of It shown through the film and they all look pretty fake. It gets distracting when the form of It in the climax looks fake which causes that scene to lose any tension that was built up. My final issue is that the film once again decides to rely much more heavily on jump scares than actual concepts. The 2017 film had scary moments that were built up and didn't come off as jumpscares but every attempt at being scary in this film was a jumpscare. Here are the positives. I feel that this film is an example of perfect casting. Each adult actor mirrors their child counterpart almost perfectly. Their acting is really good also. Bill Skarsgard, James McAvoy, and especially Bill Hader are standouts from the film. Bill Hader steals every scene he is in. He's incredibly funny and is the best part of this film. The film is incredibly funny. There are many jokes or sequences in the film that are just drop dead hilarious. I feel that some of the funny scenes were intentional while others were not but I will give director Andy Muschietti props for making this film semi self aware. There a bunch of really cool and unique transition shots and the cinematography was pretty good. Overall, It: Chapter 2 may not be as scary as the 2017 film but it's vastly more entertaining thanks to a likeable cast and hilarious sequences. I give It: Chapter 2 a 7/10.",6,0,0,8 September 2019
Parasite," Parasite Review
","Parasite is a modern day masterpiece even though it's not one of my favorite films nor is it my favorite film of the year. I have one tiny issue with the film but it is more of a nitpick. The film's message is a little on the nose but I don't have a huge issue with it but it is noticeable. Other than that, this film is perfect. There is not one bad performance in the movie. Cho Yeo-jeong, Park So-dam, and Kang-Ho Song are standouts from the film. All 3 of them have some of the best acting of the year. Their work with a fantastic script that is incredibly well written and clever makes their performance so much more enjoyable. Another aspect I loved was the cinematography. The film's slow camera movements and slow tracking shots look absolutely beautiful which go along great with the fantastic production design. The film's story and themes make this film incredible. The story of this poor family slowly infiltrating a rich family only to find out that their house is not what it seems. It's so incredibly tense. You never know what is going to happen next and it's always surprising to see what eventually happens. The film has themes of class divide and class warfare throughout which are very profound. The rich family says these lines about how great their life is while the opposite is happening to the poor family. Every time this occurs, you see how the poor family reacts and makes the scene and film itself dramatically more tense. Another thing I liked about the film was the score by Jung Jaeil. His score adds so much more to the tension. I know I'm using the word tension a lot but that's what this film is. A constant build up of tension scene by scene until it all culminates in the finale. For me, each passing scene left me more and more on the edge of my seat. One final aspect I want to touch on is the humor. Most of the jokes are cleverly written and while some of the jokes may not be that funny, I do appreciate how they were cleverly inserted instead of incredibly forced. Except this film to be on a bunch of Top 10 lists at the end of the year. Overall, Parasite is a fantastic film with great acting, great cinematography, and a powerful story about class divide even if its message may be a little too on the nose.",10,15,23,30 October 2019
The Conjuring," The Conjuring
","It's an okay film. The build up is kinda slow but it gives time to establish good characters in Ed and Lorraine Warren. The cast for the most part does a good job. 2 of the child actors are decent and the others are garbage. There is only 1 jump scare in the movie that actually got me while I predicted all the other ones.
The movie is also kinda dark lighting wise. I watched this film in a dark room and some of the scenes were just too dark to see anything.
The plot is good. I understood what was going on and what the characters are doing and why. The film flowed nicely from scene to scene. The first 5 minutes are awful though. We basically get 3 introductions to Ed and Lorraine that repeats the same thing. It's only there to establish Annabelle for her spin off movie.
The last 20 minutes are amazing though. The exorcism scene is the best sequence in the film. There's tension, the camera shakes but it works with the scene, the lighting is good, the music is good, and the makeup on the demon is really good, and most importantly, it's CREEPY.
The Conjuring is a decent horror film that provides good characters, good story, and an amazing 3rd act at the expense of bad child actors, predictable scares, slow build up, and bad lighting.",7,0,1,17 April 2019
Marriage Story," Marriage Story Review
","Wow. What a great story about relationships and the beginnings and endings of them. Marriage Story is a flawless, heartbreaking story led by two of some of the best performances of the year. Adam Driver is phenomenal. Most people know him from the new Star Wars Trilogy but people should really see some of his other films. He usually does a great job but in this film, he is 100% dedicated to the role. They are certain scenes in the film where it doesn't feel like he is acting. It feels as if he is actually this character and going through all of these troubles. He puts so much emotion into his performance that it is heartbreaking yet mesmerizing. Scarlett Johansson gives yet again another fantastic performance. While her performance isn't as mesmerizing as Driver's performance, it's still perfect. She also conveys a huge amount of emotion with her role but adds a slightly more comedic and relaxed atmosphere to Driver's serious and hardworking atmosphere. Both actors play off each other perfectly, even in scenes where their characters are fighting with each other. Every other performance in the film is pretty great, especially from Laura Dern. The script for Marriage Story is fantastic. It compliments the performances and feels very natural. It knows how much the characters need to say to get a point across or when to restrict them. The music and cinematography are great. The music is done by Randy Newman (Toy Story) and fits the depressing tone the film is going for. The film makes the good choice of not using music during certain dramatic scenes which helps make those scenes more emotional. The cinematography isn't groundbreaking by any means but there are a lot of beautiful shots. Towards the beginning of the movie, there is a 5 minute uncut shot of Scarlett Johansson talking about why she stopped being in love with Adam Driver's character and it's great. There is one sequence in the film that is perfectly shot, acted, and scripted and it's the argument scene. I felt sad and a smidge emotional for the characters throughout the film but this one scene made me feel a whole lot. It's one of the best scenes in cinema this year. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson completely disappear in this scene. It doesn't feel like acting. It feels like the filmmakers just filmed real people breaking apart. The emotion displayed in this one scene is off the charts. It cemented for me that Adam Driver is a masterclass actor that people should pay more attention to besides being known as 'the guy from Star Wars'. The rest of the film has its emotional moments but they don't top that scene. The film's plot is pretty straightforward but the way the characters interact makes the film feel unpredictable. Noah Baumbach used his direction to make a straightforward story feel unique. I'm going to start paying more attention to Baumbach from here on out. Overall, Marriage Story is a fantastic film about relationships and divorce with some of the best performances of the year, an outstanding screenplay, unique direction, and some great cinematography and music.",9,4,5,11 December 2019
Midway," Midway Review
","This film was slightly better than I thought it was going to be. It's not a good movie but it's not terrible but what do I expect from director Roland Emmerich. It's definitely one of his better films but that isn't saying a lot. This has to be one of the worst scripts of the year. Every single line of dialogue was awful and insufferable. It was obvious that all the film cared about was its visual effects instead of its script and characters. Even though the characters are based on real people, they still feel very bland and boring. I don't know why they put Nick Jonas in this movie other than to just have him in the film. The acting from most of them isn't half bad. They are trying their hardest with the material they are given and do a good job for what the film is going for. Aaron Eckhart for his limited screen time probably gives the best performance of the entire film. Ed Skrein does a pretty terrible American accent though. There were aspects to the presentation of the film I did appreciate. Before I saw the film, I did some research on the Battle of Midway and the film was actually very historically accurate. The dive bombers did miss a lot of shots and maybe only one or two would manage to land a hit on the Japanese carriers. While some may call that cheesy within the film, it was historically accurate. I also like how the film didn't demonize the Japanese unlike a certain 2001 film (Pearl Harbor). It shows them as human too and that they were doing what they had to do to protect themselves and to follow orders. The action scenes weren't half bad but mostly forgettable although some scenes did look really cool. The visual effects weren't that bad either. They were pretty meh in the beginning but they got better as the film went along. Another thing I will give the film credit for was that it was for the most part entertaining. I didn't ever feel bored even with the 2 and a half hour runtime but that might be an issue for some. The music sounded like stock war film music and there was a large amount of war film cliches thrown into the film which were very obnoxious. Some scenes are loud enough where some actors have to overdub their voices but it wasn't properly synced up at some points which took me out of the film a little. Overall, Midway may be entertaining and very historically accurate but it falls victim to an awful script, bland characters, and too many typical war film cliches.",4,2,7,18 November 2019
