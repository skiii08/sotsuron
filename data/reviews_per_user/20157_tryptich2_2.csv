Black Swan," Portman is great, but this movie is one of worst I've ever seen
","Worse than Zardoz, worse than Ishtar, anything.Zero understanding of ballet leads to ridiculous major premise: 'ooh, to do zee black swan you need to be The sexeee!' This is utter nonsense. Anyone who knows anything about ballet and in particular, Swan Lake, knows this. But the writer tries to get away with this huge, vulgar misunderstanding--and he doesn't get away with it.Uses every cliché in the book, and every vile sexist cliché, too: baad mommy (the cake! the cake!,ooh!, the horror, the horror!), classic controlling abusive artiste dom male who uh feels that masturbation is the answer to everything; pseudo-ballerina actresses who look, speak, and act like leftovers from teen slash movies. Feh.A waste of time from start to finish, and a tragic waste of fine actors. I don't know how or why this movie got made. I had been looking forward to seeing it; having seen it, I'm so sorry I went.It could have/should have been great; instead, it's an embarrassment.",1,113,214,16 January 2011
Marie Antoinette," Spectacular Spectacular
","This gorgeous, thoughtful, weird, smart, almost zanily filmic film is no mere homage to Baz Luhrmann but a direct confident, gutsy expressionist masterpiece. Luscious, detailed, idiosyncratic coloration that really worked. Incredible casting. Couldn't imagine Jason S. could play Louis XVI but he was great, and so was Kirsten Dunst, and everyone else. (Not much technical acting expertise required, however. Seems like this area remains an unknown for Coppola).Coppola had her actors perform naturalistically -- shades of Method umm's, and ahhs -- while bombarding them and us with deliberately heightened visuals (tropicana satins/diamonds/wiggery/palatial splendor) as they are puppeted through the suffocating rituals of court and history. Result: the vaunted 'conjunctio oppositorum,' conjunction of opposites creating a unified artistic whole.Daring. Entertaining. Enlightening.One could not ask for more.",9,0,1,18 February 2007
