The Ring," The best horror movie ever!!!
","This is the best horror movie of all time. I mean there's something very hair raising about a little girl who walks limping toward you. I don't mean this in a ironic way. That girl put me under the blanket many times. And that happened when I wasn't watching the movie. I saw the movie 9 times and I know it like I know my pockets. I am very found of horror movies and then, in 2002, there wasn't any good horror movie on the market. I hate monster horror movies like vampire movies or other mystical creature movie. I heard of The Ring and I said: 'Lets see what they can do now!'. I took 2 friends and started the movie. From the first scene, there is not one minute when you can rest and not being in constant fear that something bad will happen, and that's great. That's how a horror movie should be. Naomi Watts is excellent (actress and woman), she gives you the filling that she's doing this to save you, because you saw the tape to and in the same time as she. David Dorfman...made my eyes leak when he said 'mummy, she never sleeps!'; so an A+ for David. Brian Cox brings the mystery surrounding Samara. Daveigh Chase (my favorite U15 actress) makes this a very spooky movie. Whenever she appears the screen, my skin goes crazy. She's so spooky and scary that no one can stay undistracted. All the actors are excellent even if I don't mention them because this is a comment and not the story of the movie.Oh, I almost forgot about Mr. Gore Verbinski. He is one of the best directors in Hollywood. Thankyou very much Mr. Verbinski for what you've done with an overused Japanese myth.Thankyou DreamWorks! Keep it up!",10,1,2,6 June 2005
Snatch," Guy Ritchie...is the man
","From the beginning, you say (if you have at least a modest cinematographic culture): Guy Ritchie! It's an extraordinary comedy placed in the world of little mobsters. These men count their bread money in thousands of pounds...the real mobsters count them in millions of dollars. The movie it's a beautiful diamond jewel. It's a 'what you don't want to happen, will happen' movie. That's why Guy Ritchie or Tarantino movies are shocking in a very entertaining manner.The central reason of the movie is a very big diamond. And where is a diamond there always will be the greed. This is why the action goes crazy and links every character to this diamond. I won't tell you the action because I want you to watch this movie.Brad Pitt is a master at being an English gypsy. When you hear him speak...laugh and laugh...he is unbelievably funny. And that punch he can throw...wow! K.O. in the first punch, no exceptions.The other actors are perfect for their roles. They all have those criminal faces to scare any grown man.It's not an educational movie. You can learn nothing from this movie...well almost noting (you learn that a desert eagle shot can penetrate a thin wall, a pig eats anything if he is hungry and you can live through a head shot). It's pure entertainment!Anyone who thinks he has a strong cinematographic culture must have seen this movie. It's a must see movie!!!",10,0,1,7 June 2005
Saw," Best thriller ever...
","Best thriller ever! No thriller can compare with this one. Everything links in the end in a beautiful conspiracy to learn man to appreciate what they have. The 'killer' (he never killed anyone with his bare hands or a gun from his hands) puts the victims in very delicate situations. The victims are not 'angels', they all are guilty of various sins. The killer kidnaps them and when they wake up they find themselves in a adrenaline rushing situation. They all get a tape that tells them their faith. This is the most important choice in their entire life. Whether to live another few hours or to live forever (untill their time is up), because in comparison with the few hours in captivity they have, any second outside is an eternity. The missions they have to complete are very hard and they change your perspective on everything about life. The propose is to make you appreciate what you already have (family, life,...). The killer himself is a dieing man. He has cancer and he is very tired of the people unappreciative for what they have, always running like hypnotized creatures after more and more, always complaining about something in their life. The killer wakes them up with a very cold and life threatening shower. The killer's plans are perfect. No one was able to catch him or to see his face (no one still alive). He makes a mistake but he is to well prepared for everything. The actors are amazing giving that psycho feeling to the movie. The film ends beautifully. Until the end you don't know who the killer is, but you have a man with a gun ready to shot everyone, so you think that's the killer. But in the end you realize that everyone is a puppet for the real mastermind. See this movie! It's worth it. Ohhhh...and please be found of what you have...Wake up!",10,0,1,6 June 2005
