The Incredible Hulk," Is the hulk incredible? Maybe. Is his movie any good? Not really.
","The Incredible Hulk is poised to be a reboot of the popular comic book character, after the previous attempt at a Hulk movie a few years back bombed at the box office, as well as amongst fans. Marvel has done everything possible to ensure that history doesn't repeat itself: Louis Leterrier, a director known for his kinetic, hyper-violent Transporter flicks, helms this version as opposed to Ang Lee, the director of the original Hulk, known for making 'artsy' films. Academy award nominated actor Edward Norton stars in this one, as opposed to Eric Bana in the 2003 version, who was a relative unknown at the time. Despite Marvel's best efforts, The Incredible Hulk is still a disaster this time around. It shows promise in the beginning, but quickly delves into nothing more than a $100 million B-movie.Quickly skimming through Bruce Banner's transformation into the Hulk by gamma radiation overdose during the opening credits, the movie jumps right into the meat of things, with Bruce living in Brazilian slums, hiding out from the U.S military, particularly General Ross. General Ross has made it his mission to get Bruce's blood, which is radiated with gamma rays and causes Bruce to turn into the big, green monster whenever he gets excited. His plan is to use it as a weapon, creating numerous other 'hulks', and he'll stop at nothing to get it. Most of the movie is an on-the-lam take on the superhero genre, with Banner evading Ross and the U.S army, while KGB agent Emil Blonsky begins taking gamma radiation doses so he too, can turn into a monster, and take down Banner for Ross.The Incredible Hulk starts out with promise, showing Bruce dealing with the effects of his 'condition', trying to learn how to control himself and maintain a low profile at the same time. It's interesting to see how Bruce tries to deal with the infliction, and it's filled with the right mix of drama and humor (one particular lost-in-translation moment had the audience cracking up). Not before long, the military shows up and a chase overtop the roofs of the slums ensues. It's easy to see why Marvel chose Leterrier during the chase; he knows how to handle an action sequence, without delving into shaky-cam or redundancy, despite the long length of the sequence. However, by the end of the scene, Bruce 'hulks' out, and that's when the problems begin.The first apparent problem is that the Hulk looks like he's came straight out of the video game tie-in. There's been a lot of detail put into certain aspects of him, including scars and muscle tone, but nothing has been done to give him any sense of realism. He looks like a cartoon and his movements and actions are similar to those of a CG-animated character. Yes, the 'hulk' is created almost entirely using digital effects, but after movies like Transformers and Iron Man, where the effects were almost seamless, the hulk seems more in line with Sci-Fi channel level effects (for those who aren't familiar with the channel, it specializes in schlocky, cheap science fiction such as Python Vs. Boa).The bad CGI appearance of the Hulk marks the movies descent into cheese. From that point on, the film no longer provides anything of interest about the characters or their situation: it serves only to show stuff blowing up and the hulk smashing things. Despite Edward Norton being a gifted actor, he has nothing to work with here. There's no emotion, no depth to the character of Bruce Banner. Liv Tyler is given even less as Bruce's ex-girlfriend, Betty. She's pretty much relegated to following Bruce around for the entire film, not showing any personality or character whatsoever. When the movie isn't going for cheap thrills and action, it makes a few flaccid attempts at evoking emotion, such as having Bruce and Betty hug each other in the pouring rain as angelic music chimes out in the background. Or having Bruce, attempting to provide thoughtful insight on his condition, say it feels like 'having LSD poured into you'.There's nothing wrong with a film, especially a superhero movie, going straight for mindless thrills and action. However, The Incredible Hulk doesn't deliver on that either. The action sequences are too cheesy, too over-the-top and ungrounded in reality, to be remotely thrilling. Take for instance, the Hulk's second battle against the U.S military, as well as a gamma ray enhanced Emil Blonsky, General Ross's right hand man. The hulk stops smashing through things and tears some metal chunks off a vehicle, and wields them as blades, spinning them through the air. Blonsky begins doing back flips and moves out of the Matrix films to dodge each of the Hulk's attacks. It doesn't fit in with the style of the movie to have them partaking in a hyper-stylized fight more akin to a Jackie Chan film. It's completely out of character for the movie and just plain ridiculous.Then there's the finale, in which Blonsky, fully transformed into The Abomination (a hulk-like creature, but with more strength) fights the Hulk on the streets of Manhattan. The fight looks as convincing as something out of Kung Fu Panda, with a jumble of badly animated monsters leaping around the street, using cars as boxing gloves and chains to strangle each other with. It's just silly. It could be thrilling if it was more grounded in reality, if we cared about the characters whatsoever, if there was any sort of depth to the situation beyond Bruce deciding to go beat the monster up. There isn't. It's the type of scene some B-movie director would shoot if he had the same amount of money.The Incredible Hulk doesn't add any depth to the story of the hulk, yet also fails as a mindless action film. It shows potential, but ultimately fails. Marvel had their chance, two actually, and it's time to put this series to rest.",4,7,15,13 June 2008
In Bruges," The only thing worse than being stuck in Bruges is watching 'In Bruges'!
","In Bruges is one of those comedies that thinks it is far more witty and clever than it actually is. It's a shame, because it has an interesting premise with a lot of potential, but ultimately that potential amounts to nothing more than cussing and midget jokes.The film follows two hit men, Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) who are ordered by their boss, Harry (Ralph Fiennes), to hide away in the remote Belgian town of Bruges after a botched hit in London. They are supposed to stay until Harry gives them a call saying it's OK to leave. Ken seizes the opportunity to explore and sightsee while Ray, who takes an instant disliking to Bruges, prefers to spend his time at the pub. While there, the duo have many strange encounters in Bruges, including ones with a midget actor, a skinhead robber, Dutch prostitutes, and involving loads of drugs, all which lead up to a matter of life-or-death situation involving Ray, Ken and Harry.In Bruges is a strange combination of a drama and a comedy, and it really fails in both genres. The movie is primarily a comedic one. Although there are a few jokes that were mildly funny, most of them fall flat. The problem is that In Bruges presents itself as 'sophisticated' and tries to come off as clever, character-based comedy, yet half the jokes are incredibly low brow. For instance, there are repetitive jokes involving a midget. Even if the joke had been remotely funny in the first place (which it wasn't), it's repeated far too many times before the movie ends. Most of the jokes are mean-spirited and un-politically correct. Don't get me wrong, I normally wouldn't have a problem with that. However, here there is nothing funny. Ray ridicules overweight people, he karate chops the midget, he knocks out a couple in a restaurant, swears like a sailor and (once again with the midget) engages in a discussion about whether or not there will be a race war in the future. None of this is funny. It's cruel-spirited for the sake of it. The director must know that simply being mean-spirited isn't funny. There's nothing clever or witty about it. It's the same humor we've seen done before, in countless idiotic, low brow comedies, presented as a Sundance-approved, highbrow comedy.As well, it would've helped if the lead role was played by someone other than Colin Farrell. I like Farrell; he's a good actor. He is not a comedic actor though. He's just not funny. It's as simple as that. His performance here is good, but he's not funny enough for a movie like this. His character gets most of the better lines in the film and they are all wasted. Ralph Fiennes fairs much better comically, yet is relegated to the last 30 minutes of the film.The rest of the movie is a mess, as it strives to be a thought-provoking drama, as well as an action film towards the end. There are long periods of the movie devoid of jokes, which would be fine if anything were happening. Unfortunately, for the first hour of the film, nothing much happens. Ray and Ken stumble around Bruges doing random things. It's boring and dull. There are a few emotional moments here and there, and although they are well done, they don't fit in with the rest of the movie, which is often crude and crass. The last 20 minutes has some good action, violence and shoot-outs, but which once again, really has no place in this film. The ending switches gears from this and attempts to be profound. It feels out of place. 'Hot Fuzz', which came out almost a year ago and had a similar premise, stuck primarily to the comedy genre and succeeded. In Bruges tries to blend together comedy and drama, trying to be profound, rude, funny and thrilling. It's too much and the film would've worked better if it had focused more on one of these areas.All in all, I can't say I recommend In Bruges. It's a jumbled mess of a film that thinks much too highly of itself. The only thing worse than being stuck in Bruges would be having to watch this film again.",3,24,90,8 February 2008
Balls of Fury," Christopher Walken has balls to appear in trash like Balls of Fury
","If hit-to-the-groin jokes are your cup of tea, then look no further than Balls of Fury, the newest comedy from the minds behind Reno 911. Not only are there punches to the groin, kicks to the groin, and paddles to the groin, there are even chopsticks and metal spheres to the groin! If, on the other hand, you're looking for something with a little more comedic value then men being hit in their nether regions, avoid Balls of Fury like the plague.The plot, which serves no purpose but to string together a multitude of lame jokes, follows Randy Daytona, a 12 year old ping pong prodigy, who is sweeping the ping pong world by storm. Unfortunately he ends up losing an important match, becomes a laughing stock and his father, who was involved in illegal gambling, is murdered.19 years later, Daytona (played by third rate Jack Black wannabe Dan Fogler) is washed up and performing ping pong tricks at a run down theatre. FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez (George Lopez), who has been assigned to take down Feng (Christopher Walken), a criminal mastermind who runs an underground ping pong tournament, decides to enlist Daytona to help take Feng down. Daytona, besides making a comeback in the ping pong circuit, wants to get his revenge on Feng, who incidentally, was responsible for his father's death. So Daytona and Rodriguez go undercover, infiltrating Feng's annual ping pong tournament, where they...get hit in the balls.There are two very confounding things about Balls of Fury. The first being how a script so utterly bad was green lit and produced. The movies plot doesn't make a lick of sense and ambles on from one random scene to the next. In one moment, Daytona and a female ping pong master are shown as hating each other...and out of nowhere, a minute later, they are suddenly love interests. It would've been nice for the writers to put a little bit of effort in and at least include something leading up to that. Another scene has Daytona refusing to join Rodriguez in taking down Feng, only to learn that a water park has been built next to his father's tombstone. How does that provide any motivation for Daytona to strive to take Feng down? The answer is it doesn't, as the writers were to busy writing in jokes to develop a good story.This wouldn't be such a big deal if any of the jokes were actually funny. Sadly, half of the jokes either involve testicles or an old blind man walking into things, or in some instances, a combination of the two. It's not funny unless you're 12 years old (I wouldn't be surprised if the writer actually was). Not only are the jokes unfunny, they've been done hundreds of times before and done much better. When Balls of Fury does manage to include some original jokes, it involves stuff like the aforementioned water park being built next to a tombstone, which sadly enough, is less funny then the blind man falling down a staircase.The second mind boggling thing about this movie is how they managed to stick Christopher Walken in this film as the villain, Feng. There are a few other relatively known actors in here, but Terry Crews has already been making appearances in terrible movies for a while now (Norbit anybody?) and Maggie Q still hasn't become a house-hold name. But Christopher Walken? Walken is an amazing actor and it's a crime to see him act in crud like this. He's been in a few duds in the past (Envy springs to mind), but he's never sunken to this level before. Walken isn't fading out or losing appeal, in fact he just had a role in the critical and box office hit, Hairspray. How could he read a script that terrible and agree to take on a big role as the villain? The only reasonable answer seems to be that director Ben Garrant blackmailed him into taking it, as I've got to much respect for Walken to believe he'd actually willingly agree to.Walken manages to get a few laughs, which is an impressive feat in a movie like this, and steals every scene he's in. Despite working with crummy material, he still puts in a decent comedic performance as Feng, far outshining the other actors. Dan Fogler is the least funny leading man since Jimmy Fallon and mugs for the camera every opportunity he gets, imitating Jack Black as best as he can. George Lopez and Maggie Q play their roles completely straight, which doesn't work in a movie so absurd. By the end of the movie, you'll be wishing they axed the main characters and just made a movie about Feng instead.The tagline for Balls of Fury reads 'A Huge Comedy with Tiny Balls'. On the contrary, it took a lot of balls to make this movie. It took balls for director Ben Garrant to release the film without Alan Smithee in replace of his name in the credits. It took balls for Christopher Walken to act in this trash and risk losing his credibility as an actor. It took balls for Rogue to screen the film for critics, as if they expected any good reviews. Yep, it took a lot of balls to make this movie. What it didn't take to make the film was any talent. Balls of Fury is a horrid excuse for a film, and if you're looking for a funny movie to see in the theatre, go see Superbad or Hot Rod. Hell, you can even go see Halloween, as a film about a serial killer is bound to be more funny then this trash.",1,26,53,31 August 2007
The Love Guru," Bad karma or just bad movie-making? The Love Guru is a contender for worst film ever made
","I don't throw this statement around lightly. As someone who frequently reads reviews, I find that it is thrown around far too often, especially when there are so many bad movies out there. But I can say, without a doubt in my mind, that The Love Guru is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has officially dethroned classics such as Die Hard Dracula and Dark Harvest 2: The Maize. Those movies were made on minuscule budgets by no-talents. In comparison, The Love Guru was made on a huge budget by Mike Meyers, the creator of comedy classics Austin Powers and Wayne's World, which makes this train wreck of a film all the more painful to watch.With The Love Guru, you can tell Meyers is trying to create another success along the lines of Austin Powers, but failing miserably. The thing about Austin Powers was despite being a dumb comedy, the movie had a likable, fun protagonist. In Meyer's latest outing, we get the Guru Pitka, a Charles Manson look-alike who has an obsession with penises. It's somewhat fitting that he resembles Charles Manson, a notorious cult leader, as by the movies end I had a strange urge to kill myself. Not only is the Guru creepy, he's also very unfunny. Whether he's making lame puns about 'life' or talking about penises, he never manages to elicit any laughs whatsoever. It could be that his jokes are just bad. Certainly using jokes straight out of a children's joke book isn't a recipe for success. It could also be the fact that Meyers is so desperate for a laugh, he himself laughs at every joke and continuously looks at the audience, attempting to entice them to laugh along with him. You get the sense that he realizes the jokes are unfunny and the glances at the audience are his last failed attempts at getting a few laughs. Guru Pitka's character development just adds injury to the insult. One minute Pitka is being hailed as a spiritual healer who lives to help people and the next minute he's insulting a midget for no particular reason. There's no consistency to the character at all, which is what this movie is missing in comparison to Meyer's last few. Wayne Campbell and Austin Powers felt like real characters, where the Guru doesn't really have any character; he randomly does whatever moves the plot along forward.Speaking of plot, the storyline is almost as ill-conceived as the title character. A stupid plot in a comedy is acceptable if it manages to be funny, but there's nothing amusing about a Guru's quest to go on the Oprah show. That's just plain stupid. It would help if the film wasn't filled with every cliché ever known to cinema-goers, but it is. The Guru has a self-revelation at the end and changes his greedy ways. The good guys triumph. And of course, Blur's 'Song 2' plays during one of the hockey sequences, which has become the most commonly used (and groan-inducing) tune for any sports-related film.Even if you can put aside the annoyingness of the Guru Pitka, the movie still fails to deliver anything remotely funny. The most common joke is to have a characters name resemble something vulgar, such as 'Dick Pants' or some other Grade 3 level joke. The next most common is the Guru's constant repeating of 'TM' after one of his catchphrases. It wasn't funny the first time, what made Meyers think it would be funny the tenth or fifteenth? There's also the repetition of jokes from Austin Powers, ranging from the plane to even the casting of Verne Troyer, the midget who made one of his only popular appearances in the Powers films as Mini-Me. Finally, there are the gags that are just plain lame. These involve elephants humping each other, the Guru wearing a chastity belt, the Guru having a battle using mops soaked in urine, the Guru sticking his head up his own ass (which is actually far less funny than it sounds), the Guru getting punched in the groin, the Guru doing battle with a rooster and the Guru engaging in two very long song and dance numbers on the Sitar, one a rendition of Dolly Parton's '9 to 5', the other a ear-splitting variation on 'Space Cowboy' by Steve Miller Band. Both are in there for no particular reason whatsoever (and I really do hope it wasn't for laughs).The other actors are fairly bad, although they really don't have much to work with. Jessica Alba continues her tradition of playing practically the same exact character, giggling and acting ditsy. Justin Timberlake is atrocious as Jacque Grande, although to be fair, his character was a one-note joke about Quebecois people. I'm bemused that Meyers would think Americans would find a joke about a people they likely know little about funny, especially when I didn't find it funny and I'm a Canadian. Verne Troyer just proves that the only reason he has even a semblance of a career is because of the novelty that he's a midget.It really is hard to describe how utterly bad The Love Guru is. It's a stupid comedy, yes, but I'm a fan of those. I'm the guy who gave You Don't Mess With the Zohan a positive rating, so if anything this should be right up my alley. Instead, it's the worst movie of the year for sure (leaving Meet the Spartans way behind in its dust) and has reached it's place, for me at least, as the worst movie ever created. It's painfully unfunny and left me in a sour mood for a good hour after viewing. I'd rather wear a chastity belt for 30 years like the Guru rather than sit through this pile of crud.",1,175,290,20 June 2008
The Happening," What's happening? A decent alternative to the summer blockbuster, that's what happening.
","M. Night Shyamalan has had a rocky track record as of late. While The Sixth Sense was a huge hit both financially and critically, his films have slowly been declining in critical praise and box office performance ever since, which was apparent from Lady in the Water, which didn't manage to break even during it's run and was generally viewed as one of 2006's worst films. The Happening is his first new project since his last disaster and it's been billed as Shyamalan's first R-rated movie. Despite the heavier rating, The Happening is similar in style, theme and content to Shyamalan's other films, although it's a bounce back in the right direction after a few mishaps.The Happening chronicles an epidemic that sweeps the North-East coast of America. At first thought to be the result of a terrorist attack, large groups of people begin to become disoriented, lose their speech and commit mass suicide at random. The events occur sporadically, first in Central Park, then throughout New York City and eventually spreading throughout the whole North-East coast. Elliot Moore, a New York high school teacher, desperately tries to seek safety with his wife, Alma, and his best friend's daughter, Jess, as people begin inflicting death upon themselves all around them.While the film was billed as a visceral, gory R-rated horror, that couldn't be further from the truth. The Happening is more of a drama that focuses on a horrific event, rather than a straight-up horror movie. This will be familiar for fans of Shyamalan who have likely grown accustomed to his slow-moving, atmospheric films that focus much more on character than they do on generating scares. This isn't to say that the film is without its freaky moments. Some of the mass suicides, particularly one where construction workers begin plunging to their deaths, are incredibly eerie and unsettling. The idea of people turning on themselves is creepy in itself, as one can really only rely on themselves in life. By having people randomly commit suicide, Shyamalan taps into the fear of people turning on themselves and he's got the visual style to create some very chilling imagery revolving around the suicides. His use of long wide shots allows the audience to focus on what's happening, as opposed to using jumpy, sporadic cuts that end up detracting from the content (like most horror/action directors use these days). Shyamalan's already proved himself to be a master of suspense with The Sixth Sense, and there are a few shocking moments throughout the film which had me jumping out of my seat that hark back to his horror debut.The downside seems to be that in an attempt to get an R-rating, Shyamalan has thrown in numerous useless instances of gore. I'll admit I'm a huge fan of gore and violence, but it really feels out of place in a film like this. A scene in which lions bite a man's arm off or a scene where a man is torn apart by a lawnmower seems unnecessary and at odds with the rest of the film. Obviously it was a marketing strategy, but it detracts from the movie as a whole.Another weak point of Shyamalan's is his script, particularly the dialog. While he's a great director, especially at building up suspense, and he's skilled enough when working with the plot, storyline and the twists he has become famous for, his dialog is really weak. Often the stuff they say is rather ridiculous and unrealistic (a young soldier says 'Cheese and crackers' as opposed to a more common expletive) and it ends up evoking laughter in the audience. The attempts at comedy are also fairly poor, with characters randomly talking about 'hot dogs' and other things of the sort. Shyamalan's strong suit isn't comedy and while humor could be a nice contrast in a dour movie like this, it doesn't work here.The acting is also fairly bad, which is a surprise considering the cast. Mark Walberg and John Leguizamo have proved themselves to be good actors, but here they are pretty terrible, and most of the blame can be pinned on Shyamalan. They are both notorious for playing tough guys and here they're miscast, both portraying soft-spoken teachers. The issues with the dialog don't help them much either, and they're always overacting, in an attempt to appear more 'nerdy' or things of similar nature. Zooey Deschanel is entirely wrong for her role, as Wahlberg's wife, and even the character is developed poorly. She talks like a character out of 'Juno' (with the quips on the phone about Joey being a stalker) and she seems to quirky and unnatural for a movie like this, which stays fairly grounded in reality, at least for a horror. It's obvious that despite Shyamalan's directorial finesse behind the camera, he's not nearly as gifted when working with actors.The Happening isn't nearly as good as some of Shyamalan's other efforts, nor is it nearly as bad as some. It's a decently good eco-thriller that manages to conjure up some good scares, with a message beneath them all. It's not the best horror film, but it's one of the more original ones to come out recently. It definitely doesn't deserve the critical drubbing it has gotten, but then again, the same critics smashing this film are praising mindless drivel like The Incredible Hulk, so it's to be expected that a more thoughtful film would be trashed. If you're tired of seeing the standard cookie-cutter summer blockbusters, do yourself a favor and give The Happening a shot.",6,2,7,19 June 2008
