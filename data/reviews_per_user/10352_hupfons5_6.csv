United 93," Poignant, Gripping Drama
","Riveting drama.This is a powerful account of the events of September 11th -- the chaotic, shocking, horrifying events that gripped the nation and the rest of the world.The acting is so good that at times it's hard to believe that this is NOT actual footage.The FAMILY & THE FILM in Special Features of the DVD release is a moving tribute to the heroes of United Flight 93 and a respectful account of the film makers' and actors' visits to the families and friends of 9/11 victims.Very tasteful re-creation. A must see film.",10,0,2,19 November 2006
Gettysburg," Not an Award-Winning Film but Worth Seeing
","This is a long movie and some of the acting leaves a lot to be desired -- see other reviewers' comments. However, the movie has some excellent performances by Jeff Daniels, Stephen Lang, Sam Elliott, and a few others.In the DVD release, the Special Features, especially the Making of Gettysburg and the Commentary are top notch and give the viewer an even greater appreciation of the battles at Gettsburg and what is portrayed on screen in the movie.The Battle of Little Round Top and Pickett's Charge in the film show the relentless human wave attacks that 20th century war buffs mostly associate with the Korean War and the Pacific campaign during WW II. However, GETTYSBURG conveys very well the disturbing reality that Civil War soldiers were killing relatives, friends, and neighbors in some of those battles and often in hand-to-hand combat.Don't look for the pace of action or the graphic depiction of battle casualties to rival those seen in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN or BAND OF BROTHERS. What the battle scenes in this movie depict is the deadly toll of large scale frontal assaults by both the Union and Confederate forces. It defies all logic to think that hundreds of men (thousands in Pickett's Charge) would march in formation while lethal cannon shells explode in their midst and enemy marksmen fire deadly volleys of musket rounds into the advancing ranks of foot soldiers and cavalry troops. Yet, with the aid of a small robotic helicopter used to film Pickett's Charge and the massive artillery barrage that preceded it, the scale of the battle and the deadly outcome for the attacking Confederate Army are depicted vividly.The futile but heroic plight of Pickett's men becomes apparent well before the attack even begins. These were some of our forefathers shedding their blood on that hallowed ground, and the film helps to show how costly that War of the States would be on the country's psyche for more than a century after the war ended.",7,2,2,29 November 2006
We Were Soldiers," Gut-Wrenching Vietnam War Flick
","Based on the book of a similar title (We Were Soldiers Once and Men), this war film portrays the up-close, gory 'face' of battle in the Vietnam Central Highlands. It vividly shows the courage and controlled terror and rage of infantrymen in close combat.A unique aspect of this film is its heart-rending portrayal of the dread and grief of family members whose loved ones were missing or killed in action in the Southeast Asian conflict.Excellent performances by Sam Elliott and Barry Pepper. Pepper's portrayal of Galloway shows how survival instincts can overpower one's conscience in the heat of battle. Mel Gibson gives a believable performance of Lieutenant Colonel Moore's unflappable courage under dire circumstances and his love for his soldiers and their well-being.One of the most accurate Hollywood portrayals of the horrific reality of combat and the human story that underlies every victory, defeat and casualty.",8,1,2,29 November 2006
Downfall," Award-Winning Dramatic Masterpiece
","A powerfully disturbing portrayal of the last days of the 3rd Reich with riveting performances by the entire cast. Be prepared for an intense, rewarding experience on this one. From the brief documentary remarks of Hitler's secretary Traudl Junge at the outset of the film until the hopeful conclusion, this tour de force will give you plenty to think about long after the final credits fade. This is one of the best World War II films ever made.Bruno Ganz gives an award-winning performance. He's chillingly convincing in his finely nuanced portrayal of Hitler during the last years of his demonic life -- from his amazingly patient, grandfatherly treatment of his secretary to his tyrannical rages with his senior military leaders. You won't see many performances better than this.To the credit of the film's director and its casting director, the supporting cast is uniformly strong and gives compelling performances. One of the most noteworthy supporting performances is the sinister portrayal of Frau Goebbels by Corinna Harfouch. Magda Goebbels appears throughout most of the film to be an attentive mother (and political enthusiast) who prides herself at molding her 6 children into model National Socialist wunderkinder. In the film's climactic moments Ms. Harfouch convincingly portrays the pathology of Frau Goebbels' excessive glorification of the Fuhrer and his delusional ideology. Her heinous 'crime' against nature will shock and outrage many viewers.Not surprisingly, the sound effects and musical score artfully heighten the emotional intensity of the drama and suspense that unfold on screen. After the first few opening scenes of the film, which take place outside of Berlin in November 1942, the setting shifts to the bomb-riddled streets of Berlin. The 5.1 surround sound of the incoming artillery shells accentuates not only the sudden location and time change (to April 1945), but even more ominously it then continues a funereal cadence of pounding artillery explosions during the next 20 or so minutes, signaling the death knell of Hitler's crumbling empire.The musical score also provides an almost haunting backdrop to the malevolence of the Nazi hierarchy, which in the final days of the 3rd Reich cold-bloodedly inflicts a horrific toll on its own German citizens. These effects clearly signal that film director Oliver Hirschbiegel has made a film that is destined to become a classic.Although the Special Features on the DVD release are limited, they are worth watching. The MAKING OF, while running for 50+ minutes, helps to introduce many of the principal characters of this large cast, as well as provide some interesting behind the scenes comments about the film. The INTERVIEW with Melissa Muller, who wrote a book about Hitler's secretary's memoirs is well worth watching.Don't miss this one!",10,2,4,19 November 2006
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," Powerful Korean War Story
","This is a war film unlike any I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty. It artfully weaves the horrors and brutality of close-in combat fighting during the Korean War.What distinguishes this movie from most other war films is that is also is a poignant story of brotherly love and family suffering during a war that nearly destroyed both the North & South Korean societies and landscape.Some of the plot twists seem somewhat strained, but the overall impact of the film doesn't suffer. Comparisons to SAVING PRIVATE RYAN don't do justice to the cultural differences between the 2 films. This one will stand on its own merits, especially since it shows the Korean War to international audiences from a Korean perspective.A MUST SEE film.",8,1,2,29 November 2006
Saints and Soldiers," Camaraderie Transcends the Hell of War
","This film succeeds as a war story and morality tale! I liked it most for its depiction of the camaraderie that can develop during wartime among a group of 'strangers' whose common bond is survival and mission accomplishment, despite the petty human conflicts that arise.The ensemble cast & soundtrack are top notch. Look to see more from these aspiring actors in the future. The Dolby 5.1 version 'rocks' during the combat scenes.In the DVD release the 'Making of' feature is a much better extra than the director's & producer's commentary.",8,2,6,22 November 2006
