The Blair Witch Project," If you like horror films, watch it
","The Blair Witch Project, like The Ring, plays on the contemporary fear of technology, namely television. Through use of a clever advertising campaign, presenting it as a documentary, and much improvised acting, a sense of realism is captured and allows the viewer to consider how they would react in a similar position. The Blair Witch Project is very different to its horror film predecessors with its innovative hand held camera-work and 'fly on the wall' style and this works very well to allow the viewer a closer experience and more intimate relationship with the characters. Although being original and an interesting film, it does provoke many questions as to why the leading female Heather does not switch her camera off, however, as when watching most horror films, the viewer must let their cynicism go and in this case will be rewarded with a far from disappointing ending.",7,0,1,9 November 2005
