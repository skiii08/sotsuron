Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," For all Jedis,a winner!
","For all Jedis in the world,The Phantom Menace is a winner.It has awesome special effects,good acting,good story.Above all a good idea.In my humble opinion,there is nothing better than watching a Natalie Portman movie.And there is nothing better than watching a Star Wars movie!So add the two and you can't loose!I give it two sabers up,and can't wait for episodes II,and III.",Null,0,0,2 August 1999
