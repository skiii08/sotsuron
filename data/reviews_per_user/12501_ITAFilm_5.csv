The Blair Witch Project," Good film ... but worth the motion sickness
","I'll be the first to admit that the last three minutes of this movie scared me to the point where I actually had tears in my eyes.  Not since I was four years old and the flying monkeys in WIZARD OF OZ have I been so freaked out.However, the fact that I was fighting back vomit and had a dizzying time walking back to the car just wasn't worth the time for me.",8,1,1,27 July 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's great ... and gets better
","I was pretty iffy on THE PHANTOM MENACE the first time I saw it, but I've gone back a few times since, and I can't wait to keep going back!Liam Neeson and his Qui-Gon were a little disappointing the first time, but now, he/he is my favorite part!  Hats off!I'm still irritated by Jake Lloyd's performance, but he also got dealt some crummy lines ('I'm a person and my name is Anakin!'). Also, the Gungans really need to go somewhere else.Overall, though, it's a fun trip ... thanks, George!",8,0,0,21 June 1999
Casablanca," Look no further for THE perfect film
","Never has a film had it all like CASABLANCA does: fabulous story, immeasurable acting, superb technical aspects.  If there was a person who had never seen movie, this would be the one to present to him/her.  It is the ambassador of perfection of the medium.Play it again ... and again ... and again ... and again.",10,0,0,19 June 1999
American Pie," Enjoyed my piece of the pie
","I went to bed about two hours after coming home from a sneak peak of AMERICAN PIE, and my stomach still ached -- not from some of the gross-out bits, but from laughing so hard at them.The acting in this film is brilliant -- everyone plays their characters to a T.  The fact that the actors had a good script helped, too.My only complaints about it are that it: 1) the first half is a little slow 2) at times, it becomes too much of a teen-exploitation, i.e. SHE'S ALL THAT, CAN'T HARDLY WAIT.  But then again, this delves deeper than SHE & CAN'T ... perhaps after a second viewing will I up my ranking of this film to 9.But, without question, this deserves to be high up on your Things To Do List.",9,0,0,5 July 1999
Dumb and Dumber," Destined to be a classic
","Despite being shunned by many, DUMB & DUMBER is one of the brightest, funniest, and well-crafted comedies of the 1990's.Those who shun this film probably... 1) haven't seen it 2) have seen it only once 3) don't get the humorYes, the film has its share (and then some) of scatological humor, but the pure genius of the film is displayed through the intertwining of gags with plot, as opposed to a separation of the two, as evidenced in fodder such as THE WATERBOY and AUSTIN POWERS: THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME.  D&D uses humor as narrative and not as the sole reward of the film (i.e. the two examples I previously mentioned).Carrey's physical humor is very reminiscent of a Lloyd (Harold, that is, not Christmas! :) ) ... not to mention, the hard effort that Mr. Carrey put into his performance shows through and transfers to us.Perhaps when the next generation of film professors begin entering our university's halls, they will be presenting this film as a quintessential example of (well-designed) American comedy of the 1990's.",9,0,2,25 June 1999
