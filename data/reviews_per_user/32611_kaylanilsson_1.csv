Blade Runner 2049," Pretentious Loud Misogyny in guise of dystopian epic
","Someone behind this movie has womb envy, and needs to be inside his Mommie in order to control her. There is literally a female replicant who is 'birthed' from the ceiling. Her naked body is slowly explored by the camera and then she is gutted because she is barren. Sexual technology is only explored from the male point of view: there are no big dicked adonises whom women can purchase or ogle. Only women are depicted as subservient either sexually or as a carrier for violent orders from a male boss. The plot explains this as replicants being treated as 'slaves' of humans. But there is a extremely subtle pass by K's boss played by gorgeous Robin Wright who is a human. But she is non- verbally rebuffed by K. She is way too old for him the film makers probably believe. He probably does this because he has lady program at home who will be madonna or whore for him at his command.The only 'real' woman in the movie is caged behind glass because she has immune deficiencies. Harrison Ford who is in his 70's is saved at all costs: to the burgeoning revolution or the safety of his daughter. Who is put at risk by numbskull K and a ridiculous computer security system which can be easily switched back on with a dead woman's eye which isn't even open or the inability of 2049 technology to check to see if Harrison's body is in the downed transport. Oh and replicants who have superhuman strength can drown like any other dumb girl. Finally Joi, K's electric squeeze, knows everything that is happening but doesn't see a tracker being placed in her true love's clothes.OK now we come to a disposable dog who may or may not be 'real' We never find out what happened to him or her. No mention of concern either. This is just a sloppy terrible pretentious movie.",1,11,23,24 October 2017
