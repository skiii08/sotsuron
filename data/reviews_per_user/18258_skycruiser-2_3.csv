Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Absolute Rubbish
","if i could vote -10 i would, but i can't, so i'll give it 1 star and believe me that's 1 star to many, the film starts out quite funny in 'Kazakhstan' but slowly becomes nothing more then a hunt for Pamela Anderson.after thirty minutes i wondered if it was going to get better, sure enough, it got worse, the childish masturbation scene made me cringe more then laugh, not because i'm uncomfortable with seeing it, more because it signaled a total derailment of the film. I heard rave reviews and was bitterly disappointed, the end couldn't come soon enough. I fail to see the humour in drinking from a toilet bowl, how does that signify a cultural learning?",1,63,125,31 December 2006
Hostel," Terrible
","So i've just spent the evening watching this film, a few mates recommended it to me and i can guarantee you from now i won't listen to them again! The cast is weak, the storyline marginal, the horror predictable and the duration to short.It takes just on 1hr to get to the crust of the story, within 30 mins it's over and your pulling the DVD out of the machine, i was looking at the end thinking is that it? where is the rest? then i realised that it was indeed the ending, I can't understand how Tarantino got involved with this weak film, i'm even more bewildered that LionsGate is involved in it also! I'd not pay money to see this, it's totally lame, best part was the half decent looking European girls.",2,1,2,9 June 2006
Saw II," What A Head FvCk
","if this isn't one of the best psychological thrillers i don't know what is...It left me gasping for air and wanting more all in one, the ending was so twisted that i didn't even see the clues deeply embedded in the film! Was fantastic to see more the the sadistic Jigsaw, Tobin Bell really made the role his own! I can't wait for Saw 3! This is probably one of the best sequels i've seen, they way it incorporated the original into the movie is brilliant! Rise n Shine everyone....There was enough blood to satisfy even the most hardcore terror/horror film fan! One particular scene left me almost crying in fear and anguish due to it's horrific nature! here's a hint...it involves Amanda and her sordid past!Rise n Shine people...Jigsaw wants to play a game!",10,0,2,21 November 2005
