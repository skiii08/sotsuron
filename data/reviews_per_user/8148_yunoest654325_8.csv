The King's Speech," Characters with personality!!
","I am impressed!! The good point of this movie which I want to introduce is only one.It is splendor of the performances of the casts. It may be said that a character meets the cast. A performance of Colin Firth of the part of George VI in particular is perfect. The figure reading the manuscript of his figure and speech to read 'Hamlet' of Shakespeare aloud hard wants to support you unintentionally. The performance of George VI who was stammering for Firth would be very difficult, but his George VI was splendid. I want to know what kind of feeling he would play a human being called George VI with. In addition, the performance of Geoffrey Rush which played Lionel Logue which was Helena Bonham Carter and the speech clinician who performed the Elizabeth princess who is a wife of George VI is good at all.I think that the character of this movie has the personality that each one did well. It will be because there is the hint called the real person image. Because each one has personality, we become easy to get into the story.",9,0,0,30 September 2013
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Everyone should see this movie!
","This is the work which I described the strange friendship of a boy and an alien in and is an undying masterpiece.The good point of this movie is two. The first is the majesty of the back ground music. Impressive music is used simply because it is the work of the genre called SF extending over the space. It gives depth in a view of the world. It is music appropriate for tying the earth and space, a boy and an alien. Particularly, the music of the scene where a bicycle floats in the sky excites me so much. I can be impressed now just to listen to the music.The second is attractiveness of E.T. The process that becomes an important friend while I spend it with an older brother with a younger sister of Eliot and him is splendid. To an alien, they had an image to invade the earth, but this work wipes out the image in those days. In the novelty, I am surprised.If everybody watches this movie, adult will long for childhood, and the child may enjoy it purely. It is a movie wanting any person to watch.",Null,0,2,30 September 2013
Life of Pi," It is beautiful to live.
","In fact, it is very difficult for us to live and, to see this movie, is reminded of it by that I live on much sacrifice. This movie is a movie noble very with fascination.It is two points of the next that this movie is splendid. The first is beauty of computer graphics used a tiger and an Orangutan, animals and in the background. It is big existence, but the tiger which I would drift with the pie which is a chief character in particular is not seen at all for the computer graphics for this movie. Sound called the crying increases, and the force is splendid.The second is a performance of Suraj Sharma which played pi. I watched a special feature program about this work on TV. He only performed with the set of the ship in front of a blue background there. It is the work that it is not easy that matches computer graphics with one's performance while confirming the movement of a tiger and the wave with a monitor. What I want you to know is this work is his first work.This movie is a work showing strictness of nature and the beauty because of it.",10,0,2,30 September 2013
Enchanted," The work which can enjoy Disney's world and songs!
","This is the romantic work which the world of the fantasy and reality lead to by magic. If it is a girl, the Disney princess longs once. They are pretty, and they who are in love hard are attractive.This movie has two splendid points. The first is character of Giselle who is a heroine. She is a young girl of country Andalasia of the fairy tale and has character that I am selfish in romanticists. However, I have strong faith and am pretty and am a person not to be able to hate. She who was in love with Robert in reality swings him around, but he cannot hate her.The second point is a song sung in a work. It is good for Disney work and is a musical style. The music that I in particular like 'is Happy Working Song'. Giselle singing happily is very pretty and I love it. In the scene where Robert leaves Giselle who begins to sing, I laugh unintentionally.It is in the feeling that I say to do its best when I watch Giselle who tells love to Robert without being discouraged. This is a work giving courage to people.",9,1,1,30 September 2013
Big Fish," The work which can enjoy two world
","This is the story that a son and a father reconciled, but is a work having the big theme, reality and the fiction.The charm of this movie is scene constitution distributed neatly. The scene of the reality that there are flashback that is the fantasy which father Edward talks about and son William is repeated in turn. Only a story of the fantasy does not need to extremely advance. William says a story of Edward is lie and he wants him to tell about truth. However, I think; 'then what is lie? And truly what is it? ' For example, I tell a person to have watched a 2 meter-long snake yesterday. The person thinks it is lie, and it becomes the lie among the people at that point. In fact, the snake which I thought to be length of two meters was the snake which had only length measuring 1 meter. However, this is never a lie because I think that I when I tell him am a snake measuring two meters.As for my having learned by this movie, the standard to ascertain a lie and the truth is that different by a person after all. We live by matching it with the person of the circumference.",8,0,0,30 September 2013
The Artist," The masterpiece of the silent film!
","This is the work which the times of the changes from a silent film to a talking film were drawn on. It is described in a silent film style and conveys the charm.The good point of this movie is two. The first is that back ground music is used effectively. The music playing through the whole book at most time is sometimes light with beauty and is sometimes sad. It becomes the thing to the feelings of the character and draws us into the world of the story more. In addition, to the contrary some scenes are silence on purpose, it attracts a glance and do it in the impressive scene.The second is an expression of the actors. Because the works is silent films, there are not the lines. Therefore the personality of characters becomes clear, and the expression is rich. The feelings of two people of the leading role in particular are plain.This movie does not depend on lines. This movie reminds you that it is not lines to be important and is the expression of the actor and the imagination of the audience for a movie.",10,3,6,30 September 2013
Departures," Think about death through work of embalmer
","This is a story which approaches for 'death' through an occupation called the embalmer.There will be few people who have been conscious of an occupation called embalmer. This is an extremely special occupation. In Japan, it was work of the people who were not treated as a person without having rank hire him either in old days. Not at all, but it is sure that I stay even if there is a little prejudice for embalmer now. This work draws the fact. That is why this movie only impresses many people not the movie which only denies prejudice without accepting the fact. And it affects the Japanese society slowly.However, this movie is not the serious movie which merely approaches for death calmly. It sometimes takes in humor and the music is used, and there is the bright scene and is not too gloomy. A way of the approach is a good work.",7,0,0,30 September 2013
The Reader," Two persons' story which never becomes equal.
","This is a work with the history, life and death, a very heavy theme. I think about how I compensate for the mistake that has been repeated in the history. German Nazis party is the keyword of this.It is an elaborated story that this movie is splendid. It is the relationship of a man and a woman ―their name is Michael and Hannah― if I say in detail. They surely love, but always pass each other; and are not equal relations. If their relationship included the top and a bottom, two people met you; Hannah is the top at first. Michael is a student learning a law, and Hannah is an older woman working by rail of the cities. But, in fact, Hannah does not understand a letter, and the position relations with him who learns both the Greek and the Latin reverse. They meet again in a court. She is the person is judged. He is a person judging.The Nazis party killed many people. However, even so, it is difficult for all people concerned with the Nazis party to execute it. She is not totally without a crime, but she may say one people of the victim if she changes a viewpoint.",8,1,1,30 September 2013
