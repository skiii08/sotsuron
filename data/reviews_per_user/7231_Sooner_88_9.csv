Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," My personal favorite out of the whole trilogy...
","Yes!? This is my favorite out of all of them. Why? Cause the story is the beginning of a saga that started first before Episode IV started it all! It has the beginning of my favorite Jedi, 'Obi-Wan', and who else can't forget the memorable 'Darth Maul' who will go down as the most BA character next to Darth Vader. But, all else aside this movie is just great for me. I seen it when I was 9 or 10, young age and was just starting to become a geek for Star Wars. Seeing Star Wars Episode I for the first time in theaters was memorable for me. I mean, I actually sold my Playstation One for a measly 80$ just to see this and It was sort of worth it after later of realization, Lol. I can forgive Jar Jar cause I never really dewelled on his character, and thus still having great action, visual effects stunning as ever, and POD racing was a great rush. Can't say no to this is my favorite right next to Empire, Return, and Revenge of the Sith. 10/10",10,20,36,11 November 2009
Akira," 8.9 & In the Top 20!!!..
","Yes, Akira needs to be at least in the Top 20 of 250! It is a landmark in visual cell animation that now, not even a mere experienced artist can fathom... The story is the most original that it can be and is the closes thing to a futuristic perfection like Blade Runner. The violence that is in this movie is not without noticing, but isn't something that needs to be put down, this movie to a mere 7.9??? It's a visual wonder and a epic piece of emotion when it comes to knowing your breaking points and what to do with them when you began to lose it. I got say this is my favorite anime cause seeing it when I was only 12 or 13 was like watching something unfold like a fairy tale of dark vs light.. A very unforgettable film that will have people wondering why Katshiro Otomos epic was never considered to be a visual wonder...",10,0,3,13 November 2009
Suicide Squad," Not as bad as you think.
","DC movies get a bad rap in today's movie market. When Marvel has won over the majority of peoples taste and perception, I feel a bias can be made from the 'to like one you have to dislike the other' mentality. Is Suicide as awful as they say?No it's not. I enjoyed for what it had to offer. And what it offered to me is an early example of what DC can do if they don't shoot themselves in the foot. I know DC comics. I've read a majority of their titles over the years. The Suicide Squad is a B-list/D-list title for villains. And DC has great villains(hence why Harley/Deadshot/Joker were the selling point). DC has an unlimited amount of content to take from but they seem to hire writers or staff that don't know or obtuse to the library of DC. Now, I'm not going to fanboy over this film. It was flawed in many ways. And the Joker(portrayed by Leto) was completely underused and thrown under the bus. That's not good to do to your talented actor. The editing was choppy, and the sequence somewhere a 3/4th's into the film is random and rushed(edited by a trailer crew).The other problem is the script. Whoever green lit a script that was complete in three weeks, needs to find another profession because that is not ample time to make a good film or any film in general.David Ayer does deserve some credit. His choice of costumes and colors is an upgrade from the dower dry and gray BvS. All in all I enjoyed it... For what it was. Take that for what it is worth.",5,0,3,10 May 2017
Now You See Me," Not better than I expected. But it delivered!
","I enjoy magic shows. Penn & Teller, Magic secrets exposed, etc. And the Prestige is without a doubt one of my favorite films(top 20). I seen the trailer for this film back in 2013. Never gave it a shot, because it looked to much like a Oceans/Italian Job/Prestige all thrown in together. It was unfortunately, but hay! I enjoyed the hell out of it.The plot is no different from something like your typical heist movie, comparably Oceans franchise. Throw in some magic and you got yourself a unique narrative that should be blockbuster worthy? Yes, and no. Yes, because the magic of course drives this movie. No. Because the twist to me was way to out of left field(and that's all I'll say). But me loving the Prestige so much, I have to say I can't deny this movies charm and fun. I embrace a movie that holds to true to exposing the art of magic for all it's glory.The script could of been better though. The characters where not to fleshed out(especially the Daniel/Henley relationship). Woody Harrelson did a fine job again(playing the hermit/Merritt) as he always does. The only flaw of the cast would be Jack played by Dave Franco. He didn't have much screen time to deliver his dialogue, and for the most part was just there. But overall, the casting was on point.I love movies about magic, and the art/science of it. It's the oldest spectacle in human entertainment. This movie felt like I was in Vegas(never been there. I know right?), and makes me want to go their even more to witness something like this live in person. 8/10",8,0,0,12 May 2017
Event Horizon," Event Horizon has its moments but, nothing to get underwhelmed about!..
","This I would honestly say.. Is the best last horror sci-fi movie that Hollywood has had a decent crack at it since lately..well, Pandorum! People want to give pandorum a high stake in its genera when Event Horizon is (quote Sam Neill) 'something much much more!' It breaks the bounds of the psychological mind and brings out the nasty horror of what true interpretation of hell really is! It's mind numbing to see a director Paul S. Anderson give the audience something really gritty and not be accepted as a great sci-fi classic!? It's puzzling... Although the clich√©'s will be seen, that doesn't effect the nightmare it will effect on you if you are easily traumatized by graphic horror. The movie itself is a miss understanding that to enjoy a film like this, is to leave all realism outside. This movie is a fright fest if you really let it be, and it will never let you go once you accepted it! 10/10",8,0,1,13 October 2009
Avatar," Is this the Star Wars of our decade?
","I want to say for one, that this movie was EXTRAORDINARY! And for what it's worth comes everything you can't possible imagine of what Cameron had in store for the audience. It was mesmerizing to see that the 3-D lived up to its hype and and wowed everybody in my theater. Like only 2 people used the bathroom within a 2 and half hour period!? That is the mark it left with audiences when it first appeared on screen. Nobody knew what to expect, and in the following, everyone got what they didn't expect which was lush colorful movie with some great CGI that was perfectly complimented with a great story... Some will beg to differ, but the real star is the 3-D. Yes, the 3-D! Wow, It has as of today changed the way will see our entertainment and how we view it. So ladies and guys I would prefer everyone to see this cause it is only worth the time on the big screen while still in 3-D format. 20/10..",9,51,90,18 December 2009
La La Land," Not bad at all. For a musical...
","I can admit right off the bat, that I'm not a fan of musicals. AT ALL. The only other musicals I watched in my lifetime was Little Shop of Horrors(because of the special effects) and Chicago(because it also won best picture over what I think are better candidates). Hardly if ever watched them again. So I tried to see what all the hype is about this one. Was it good?Yes, admittedly it is. I like the characters. The opening was one of the best tracking shots I seen in a movie comparable to The Third Man(1958), along with some other scenes in the movie that I was impressed with. The music didn't over weigh the plot, and the it made sense within the story(especially in Ryan Goslings case)I enjoyed this film, and could recommend it to anyone willing to give musicals a shot. And I would of preferred if this won best picture, over Moonlight(sorry I just think so)",8,3,6,10 May 2017
Kong: Skull Island," What 1976 Kong should of been.
","I'm saying that as a fan of the 1976 film, which gets a lot of flack and disdain. But this Kong film is a breath of fresh air, compared to the 2005 remake of the classic Kong from 1933. How was the film?I really enjoyed the film. Great CGI, along with great action, and set pieces. Only thing setting this apart from being much greater is the cinematography and characters(besides three of them).The cinematography doesn't do much to distinguish the size of the characters and the size of Kong. To many times you'll question the scope is uneven and is noticeable. And for the characters. Most of them are have no room to layer themselves in the plot. They're mostly your run of the mill, disaster team built squad of characters. Find the island, put together team, got to island, no connection but to survive, etc.But the best characters within the film is the WWII pilot portrayed by John C. Reilly(Hank Marlow), John Goodman(Bill Randa), and believe or not, Samuel L. Jackson(Preston Packard).John C. Reilly stills the show as the most lovable character. He is what glues the other characters together once he enters the scene. John Goodman, underutilized as he was, still makes good use of his screen time. And Sam Jackson portrays a really good broken captain in a battle between man and beastI recommend this film if your wanting to see an excitingly good monster flick. 8/10",8,0,4,10 May 2017
Cloud Atlas," The run time killed it a little.
","I would of given it a higher score if the run time wasn't as tedious. The Wachowski's do what they do best. Tackle hard Sci-Fi concepts, and aren't afraid to make something original and daring. And this movie was a good attempt on that part.I enjoyed the set pieces, acting, and script. The plot can get muddled, but once the one hour and thirty minute mark kicks in(yes, a long movie) that other hour and thirty minutes is what makes up for the dragging pace. It's use of editing for the jump in timelines is well shot. As well as the CGI(which the Wachowskis are known for)I recommend this movie if you are or not a fan of the Wachowskis. Just be ready for a lengthy film.",7,0,2,10 May 2017
