Lucky Number Slevin," Mediocre
","I saw this movie during a brief stay in London, approaching it with guarded skepticism, given that the mud season is when Hollywood ushers its 'second tier' to the markets. The beginning of the movie is promising enough; the opening scene is loaded with atmosphere and brutality, and is followed by some effective set up scenes that outline the plot. That plot, however, turns out to be weak, contrived and predictable. I emphasize the last point, because with a little imagination, the viewer can frame the entire story within twenty minutes of the opener. Not a good sign for a film that relies on twists to entertain its audience. The weak plot is not the only indictment against this movie. In a deliberate effort to mimic the 'cool' of that famous auteur (you know who) of the nineties, the movie relies heavily on irreverent dialogue and subtle pop culture references. Derivative can work - plenty of others have taken the same tact with some success - but in this case it does not. Virtually all of the dialogue is mere filler; there isn't a single memorable line in the movie. The characters, in an obvious nod to Reservoir Dogs, are referred to by (not so) clever nicknames. This attempt at garnering cachet is fitting, because none of these characters amount to more than the vapid stereotypes that such nicknames inform them to be.That's not necessarily terrible, because a great actor can make such contrivances work. Incidentally, there are certainly plenty of recognizable actors in this film. The problem is, the pieces don't fit, and at no point in the movie are you left with the impression that anyone is trying very hard. Morgan Freeman in particular seems perfectly content to continue the ten year campaign against his acting reputation. On the flipside, Lucy Liu does a credible job as the love interest of someone ten years younger than her, and Bruce Willis is certainly wooden enough for the part of a stoic assassin.This movie isn't beyond redemption. I didn't walk out of the theatre, and you can kind of enjoy it, so long as you're content to space out for the duration. Its got plenty of flash, but not much else. Its an effectively meaningless exercise and nothing about it changes my impression of spring movies. Just not very good.",5,21,47,7 April 2006
Gran Torino," Not good
","I watched this film with 36 other people scattered throughout the (mostly empty) theater. Six loudspeakers were mounted on the side walls, three on the rear wall. There were six stage lights (dimmed) in front of the screen. I know this, because I was forced to entertain myself in some fashion during this film's painful two hour duration.There are absolutely no redeeming features to this film. Poor acting, directing, screen writing, producing, and probably gaffing, key gripping, and makeup too. Everyone involved in this effort should be ashamed of themselves. The only thing that makes this better than a one-star affair is the likely existence of even worse movies, that I have not and hopefully will never see.",2,6,14,1 February 2009
August Rush," I was compelled to watch this against my will
","And this is why my will should be more highly regarded. What to say, other than that this is the kind of sappy, melodramatic garbage that's more fit for Sunday afternoon viewing on the Hallmark channel? Let's begin with the plot, which actually doesn't exist. The movie simply rambles aimlessly from one episode to the next, shamelessly invoking deus ex machina when needed. In some ways it feels like something Terry Gilliam might have made in his absolute nadir after downing bottles of fluoxetine.I suppose you could call this movie character driven, but those characters are depressingly shallow. Some of them, such as the one played by Robin Williams, are severely irritating and detract from little the movie has going for it. There is no point in going into too much detail here, but this brings me to the Robin Williams corollary; the man hasn't been involved in an above-average movie in over a decade. It stands to mention that only a small minority of the past decades' films featuring Williams are even actually average.So in summary; I want my money back. In fact, I want more than my money back; I considered my time watching this movie as working. It was a truly herculean effort not to walk out. Shouldn't I be rewarded for that?",3,22,37,31 December 2007
