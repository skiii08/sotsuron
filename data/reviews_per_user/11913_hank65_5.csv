Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," PRECISELY what's wrong with it---
","The script!Lucas was never a great scriptwriter, and always a superb imagist. Well, his strength is here at its greatest, but so is his weakness. The images of this movie make it a must-see, but the genuninely lousy script make it painful in repeated viewings. It's worth noting that he borrowed a plot for the first film--the only other screenplay he has sole credit on--from Akira Kurasawa's 'The Hidden Fortress.'Two examples, one minor and one major, illustrate this perfectly.The major problem is Anakin's age. I can believe a gifted 12-year-old boy could do the things Anakin does in this film. But Anakin is supposedly EIGHT YEARS OLD. At that age, the character is simply unbelievable. Jake Lloyd isn't a bad actor (for his age!), he's just been given things to do which that young a boy could NOT do, no matter how gifted by magical powers, or which look silly (think of him in the fighter in the final battle sequence, for all the world like a kid playing in his father's car.) Any sensible writer would know this. The extreme youth of Anakin makes the ENTIRE subplot concerning him a failure, and all the inspired CGI you throw at it isn't going to change that.The minor example concerns the battle droids. They come across as no threat, because they are so easily destroyed by two Jedi. A good writer would have first shown two or three battle droids easily defeating 40 or 50 ordinary soldiers, establishing that they are a real threat. THEN, the Jedi's easy victory over them doesn't make them look silly--it establishes how much more powerful the Jedi are.These are only two examples, but unfortunately, there are many more: the trade dispute which no one who's ever watched the film understands, the unnecessary subplot about the Princess changing places with her twin handmaid (which is also not done well), the podrace which seems grafted on to the rest of the movie (though it is done well), and, of course, Jar-Jar Binks.Lucas has put a high gloss on this with an overwhelming amount of inspired images, but the general dissatisfaction with the film shows it was not enough.",Null,0,1,23 October 2001
Blade II," No, it is *NOT* as good as the first, and here's why
","There's a certain realm of bad movie that will carry away juvenile fans because of the high level of craft that goes into them. They might have great images, great effects, great cinematography--but inside, nothing's there. This is one of *THOSE* movies.'Blade 2' was designed to be wall-to-wall action scenes and a genuine comic-book movie, and at that it succeeds brilliantly. Unfortunately, that is *ALL* it succeeds at, and I was struck by how very little the makers of this film wanted to achieve. Why did they think so small?The characters are not as interesting as in the first movie, since the director and writer so clearly don't care about them. The dialog is truly dreadful, though there is very little of it, so that it won't get in the way of the pumped-up action scenes.Aside from the action scenes, which are eventually boring due to the lack of any variation in pace, there is a terrific monster/anatagonist, mutant vampires called 'reapers,' with a tripartite jaw that opens from a cleft in their chin. The technical staff who envisioned and executed these beasts deserve to be commended.Unfortunately, while the technical staff did their job well, the writer and director did not. This is very disappointing, given what a jewel-in-the-mud the original 'Blade' was, and that David Goyer wrote them both. And the director, Guillermo del Toro, has talent.Basically, this movie doesn't have the heart the first one did, and the director has never heard that less can be more. Will appeal to teen-age boys and others of limited apprehension and taste.I'm aware there is a large fanboy contingent that will think this a great movie, but I assure you, those feelings will fade as you grow up.",Null,0,0,5 April 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Yes, it *IS* as bad as 'Phantom Menace'
","Everyone currently talking about how much better Part II is than Part I are going to experience a tremendous *POP* in a few months, as their heads come out of their asses and they realize how they've fooled themselves.Cast your mind back to 'Phantom Menace,' and remember the wishy-washy way everyone was talking about the wonderful images and effects, and trying not to focus too much on Jar-Jar, Jake Lloyd, and the god-awful script. It took a few months before a consensus was suddenly achieved that hey, it really was bad. No one wanted to believe it.Well, the same thing is happening again, with far less excuse.Yes, it has some cool moments, particularly towards the end (and Christopher Lee, I'll give you, is awesome)--but this movie SUCKS. Sucks sucks sucks suck sucks. Sucks like a Hoover. Has high levels of ambient suckiosity. Stop trying to convince yourself it's good--you've been taken for your ticket price, and you might as well admit to it.Yes, there is less Jar-Jar, but we have the Padme/Anakin love story to take it's place. Yes, we don't have an unconvincing child as the hero, but instead we get a whiny, self-pitying adolescent. (I'm undecided as to whether Hayden Christiansen is a terrible actor; he was given a part that Olivier couldn't have played.)By the time you start get the big action scenes, towards the end, it is impossible to care about the characters. For the first hour and a half the movie is boring and forgettable, except for the few scenes that are so dire they become unintentionally funny, and memorable for all the wrong reasons.When Anakin, in an overheated moment, tells Padme that he loves her so much he's 'in agony,' someone in the audience with me muttered, 'So am I.'This is a film that cries out for two robots and an astronaut down in the right corner, making wisecracks as it spools out.",Null,0,0,23 May 2002
Apocalypse Now," REDUX: better *AND* worse, and a Phantom Edit might be perfect
","Well, I have finally seen the 'Redux' version, and it was interesting.The original cut of the film survives in the memory as a great failure, filled with searing images and sequences, but with NO cohesion between the set-pieces, and leading up the river to the Waterloo of Coppolla's artistry, the Kurtz sequence, which never worked for a minute, then or now. And, if anything, the film was overlong. If you were to ask me for a list of films that emphatically did NOT need to be any longer, 'Apocalypse Now' would be at the very top. But what was particularly interesting at the time was that lack of cohesiveness in the first half of the movie. Coppolla had made his name in his earlier films from his ability to sketch in characters economically and well, and that was completely missing here. You gained no feeling for Willard or the characters on the boat, and it didn't flow, it jerked from image to scene to whatever, each piece in itself memorable, but not building any dramatic arc or impression.Well, 'Redux' changes that. With some small additions and re-structuring, the first half to two-thirds of this really are the great movie Coppolla so desperately wanted it to be, which feels and moves infinitely better than its original cut. The feeling of traveling up the river to a more grimly primordial world is palpable, and almost wholly lacking earlier.For example, the stealing of Kilgore's surfboard gives a greater sense of Willard's character, because it's a reaction to Kilgore. In the original cut, it's all passive. You never see Willard reacting to what he's experiencing, he just observes, and the portentous narration tells us what he's thinking.Unfortunately, it's still a grand failure. The film skids to a stop in the famous French plantation scene, and the utter dramatic failure of Brando as Kurtz makes the end of this cut as unmoving, embarrassing, and boring now as it was 20 years ago. The tremendous improvement of the first two acts of the film throw into high relief how badly the last act doesn't work.I suspect Coppolla knows this, in his heart. He did lots of subtle restructuring and re-editing of the first two-thirds of the film, but virtually none in the last third. There, he just threw in the French plantation scene and an extra scene with Kurtz, and called it good.Maybe what we need is a Phantom Edit version. Maybe Willard should get up the river to a vast anti-climax, with Kurtz already dead ('Mistah Kurtz, he dead'), and nothing to show for the journey. That would leave a version of the film with the good bits kept and the bad bits discarded, and an ending that would work, as opposed to the one it's got, which still doesn't, and which detracts from the parts that are worthwhile.",Null,0,0,5 September 2001
The Godfather: Part III," As bad as you've heard, if not worse
","It's funny--photograph a film well, do a good set design and images, hire good actors, but have nothing to say, no story to tell--and a lot of people will be fooled into thinking they've seen something worthwhile. Look at every positive or even vaguely positive review for this film.Despite what anyone says, this is a long, annoying, silly film, with nothing to say. Yes, Sofia Coppola wasn't up to playing the lead role, but Al Pacino was just as uninteresting, due to his character's poor conception.Hell, even the boys at the Bada Bing club in 'The Sopranos' know that part III is crap. Discount thoroughly the deluded movie geeks that write otherwise.",2,4,8,1 October 2001
