Kill Bill: Vol. 2," If God were a movie director, his last name would be Tarantino.
","I was VERY impressed with Vol. 2.  When I first saw Vol. 1 Nov./2003, I was a bit disappointed at first, however, it became much better with the second viewing, and I certainly appreciated the incorporated 70's Kung-Fu/Film elements.  However, Vol. 2 was amazingly outstanding, the dialogue, the cinematography, the characters, the background story, the flashbacks, everything was near perfect.  I admire Tarantino for his films, and above all the fact that he has only directed a total of 5 movies (including `My Best Friend's Birthday, and counting Kill Bill as one film), and he already has become a living legend in my eyes.  I can hardly wait to see more of his films, and not to mention the `SINGLE' DVD release for Kill Bill (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 in one set). This film is outstanding, definitely worth the time and the money, if I ever have a chance, I would personally compliment Tarantino myself.7.0/10 Kill Bill  Vol. 1 -- 9.0/10 Kill Bill  Vol. 2 -- 8.0/10 Kill Bill overall",Null,0,1,2 May 2004
Ali," The world's watching
","Nicely added together mix of biography, action and drama.  Great way of telling the life story of the world's greatest boxer of all time.  Of course it must be mentioned that without Will Smith this movie wouldn't have been that great.",6,0,0,25 February 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," The end of a new beginning...
","Matrix Revolutions, part three of The Matrix trilogy, wraps the story up neatly This movie explains the unanswered questions, which Reloaded left many viewers with.  Many people had complains about Reloaded, that it was too confusing, it contradicted the first movie, and so forth.  However, the `Truth' comes out in this movie and the ones who compare it to part one of the series will be disappointed.  The problem is, that The Matrix was released without any warning, and most people did not know what the matrix was about due to minimal advertisements.  When Reloaded was released the expectations were so high because The Matrix was a movie that revolutionized movie making.  Most trilogies are structured this way, including the classic Star Wars Trilogy, and I believe this was the best way to expand and finish the Matrix mythology created in 1999.  The Matrix, the movie that began it all, remains to be the best film out of this trilogy due to its phenomenal influence of a new beginning of film making for future films.9/10  The Matrix / 7/10  The Matrix Reloaded / 8/10  The Matrix Revolutions",4,3,6,5 November 2003
Dog Day Afternoon," One of Pacino's 'low end' movies.
","One of Pacino's 'low end' movies.  Pacino himself played a pretty decent role, among him other actors did also a decent job with the movie.  It is just that the plot was not great at all, in fact it was very disappointing. The movie contained too many lengthy scenes where nothing happened and the over all suspense area of the movie was very dull. Overall it was a pretty bad movie.",4,4,21,25 February 2002
Moulin Rouge!," McGregor saves the day!
","Prior to watching Moulin Rouge! , I only heard amazing things about this movie.  However I was warned that it IS a musical, and I was not sure how well this movie was really made since I am not a fan of musicals.  As the movie begins Ewan McGregor's narration lays an impression on the viewer. The opening scene is serious and sad when McGregor is explaining what has happened.  His narration continues the movie changes rapidly into a ridiculous comedy that does not seem appealing at all.  It continues for another hour to have this great touch of a ridiculous comedy which is not funny I might add.  The first hour of the movie was completely boring and seemed very weak, however in certain scenes McGregor proved his acting ability very well and showed the audience how well he is capable to act. The story does not pick up until half way through the movie.  That is when the climax begins and the story begins to take a serious shape compared to the first half.  The second hour of the movie has many twists and turns in the sense of the complications between the two main characters.  They are caught between their love and their duties and seem to forget how badly they are tangled up in this obstacle.  Again the story changes rapidly from a ridiculous comedy into a serious romantic drama.  It continues with its more serious side until it hits the end.  The ending was not unexpected but without a doubt it can be said that it was a better ending than most recent movies that have been released.  For a regular movie person the ending would be predictable, but the overall performance near the end raises and became much better than it was at the beginning of the movie.  One has to sit through the movie in order to completely understand what is going on and in order to determine what kind of movie this is.  To come to a conclusion and give this movie a definite genre, Moulin Rouge! is a musical love story beyond any doubts, it is preformed in a comedic style as the movie opens, however it changes into a dramatic love story as it proceeds.  As a personal note I might add that this movie was no Oscar material accept Ewan McGregor's performance.  I believe that with this movie or even his prior movies he has proven that he is a great actor with great abilities.  Him being in the cast was probably the only reason that I did watch this movie. As another private note I wish to add that for the 2001 Oscar nominations if there was anyone worthy of winning the `Beat Actor of the Year' award it would have been McGregor rather than Denzel Washington for `Training Day'. This once again proves that the Oscars are not concerned with ART in movies but rather larger box office digits.  One last statement that I want to close this off with; this movie is not for everyone, you have to sit through a lot of senseless material in order to get through this and it will not be easy (I warn you now!).  As I mentioned it before, if this movie has one strong element to it then it was Ewan McGregor, In other words, McGregor saves this movie from being `very bad' to `okay'.",5,0,1,22 April 2002
The Matrix Reloaded," Read the review, hopefully my attempt to cover all the bitchy points was successful
","When `The Matrix' first came out in 1999, it had a similar impact on the world of cinema as Star Wars did in 1977.  The reason these two movies blew the audience away was because of their visual breakthrough.  `Star Wars, Episode IV: A New Hope' was loved by everyone and was a hit at the box office while the BEST Star Wars Film `The Empire Strikes Back' will only be the second best.  Both, `Episode IV: A New Hope' and `The Matrix' set the basis for their next two installments.  `Episode IV: A New Hope' ended on a happy note, because as far as the audience was concerned, the Death Star wars destroyed and the day was saved by some boy who seems to have some Jedi powers, but is only a good pilot.  Similar to Episode IV, The Matrix ended on happy note because at the end Neo realizes that he is the one' and he has great powers within the Matrix and can do as he pleases. Now that we have set a base for the story, we can continue with the story WITHOUT going back and explaining everything again.  `Lord of the Rings  The Fellowship of the Ring' had a VERY similar pattern to the Matrix and Star Wars Trilogy, and most people had the same complains about the second part of the trilogy: `Too much action, not enough story, not enough character development, not based on the book, etc'.  My point is, that when something comes out of the blue and the audience is unaware of it, then it's liked, but when something is hyped and well known, there will be a great chance of most people complaining about the movie.Some of the dumbest complains I have EVER heard about a trilogy: For those who think that every sequel should be a stand-alone; I'm sorry, it doesn't work that way.  At the end of Empire Strikes back, Luke finds out what is really going on, Hutt kidnaps Han, and the ENTIRE story has a completely different twist to it and the movie ends without answering A LOT of questions.  The Matrix Reloaded does the EXACT same thing as The Empire Strikes Back, it ends a point when the story I getting most interesting: that point is called the climax!Purpose of a trilogy: In a trilogy, the second movie will always end with many unanswered questions and unexplained actions.  That's the entire point of making three parts to a story: you can tell a LONG story in three parts without cutting out too much of it.  Imagine all three Lord of the Rings books, all six Star Wars Episodes and all the Harry Potter books in one movie!  It would be awful!  Therefore, if there are unanswered questions and unexplained actions in Reloaded then they WILL be explained in the next one.  Again, that is the point in making a trilogy: tell a long story without cutting out the detail! I am sick and tired of people complaining that this movie ended without an explanation.  Doesn't anyone hit them with the stupid stick and tell them that part three of this movie will be out the SAME YEAR!Other trilogies: [since everyone is comparing The Matrix to every other trilogy that's been out!]: Just like other big hit and successful trilogies such as: Back to the Future, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars [4-6, before Lucas decided to screw it all up!], Matrix Revolutions will finish off the story by explaining all the cliffhangers from Reloaded. As far as I am concerned, the Wachowski Brothers are the ONLY one to do that; release part three of a trilogy the same years as the sequel!Conclusion: Either way, this was a great sequel, one of the best I've seen I might add, and I have no doubt that part three [THE CONCLUSION  for those who don't realize that part three will concluded everything!] will be another great cinema experience just like the previews two.The Matrix: 9/10  -- The Matrix Reloaded : 8/10",4,0,0,24 May 2003
Hart's War," Very unrealistic and acted out very bad
","An unrealistic and unsuccessful try to make a suspense drama.  The only strong element in this movie was the acting, which wasn't even supplied by Willis.  The better acting supplied to the audience was done by Colin Farrell who played Col. Tom Hart and Marcel Iures who played Col. Werner Visser and did an excellent job as a Nazi officer.  However acting isn't the only element that makes a movie.  The plot was really thin and completely unrealistic and the suspense was nowhere near great.  If for some reason you can't watch it, don't worry about it, there are better movies out there (A Few Good Men, Rules of Engagement).",1,4,9,25 February 2002

Lastly for those who are unaware of the fact or are blissfully ignorant of it, this movie is a total and direct rip off of the great classic masterpiece `The Great Escape'.  If you liked Hart's War you should see `The Great Escape' because I am very certain of the fact that you will dislike this movie before it finishes. For those who disliked Hart's War to begin with, they will even dislike it more.",1,3,6,15 March 2002
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," The British answer to 'Blazing Saddles'
","This movie can be easily called 'the British answer' to Blazing Saddles. Of course being a British movie it has its own style and caliber of comedy. Overall it's a great movie that includes good humor but you have to really like the sense of humour.  Watch it for sure, can't miss it.",8,0,0,25 February 2002
