Black Swan," Instant Classic!! A movie that can be watched over & over again.
","I watched the movie, having no idea what to expect. i didn't know anything about it except its a Natalie Portman movie.The Directing is close to perfection in this movie, you could feel it from the start. Darren Aronofsky did no mistakes, Amazing job!, the screenplay & the thrills are perfectly timed which leaves you wondering throughout the entire movie.Natalie as always, lives up to her expectations, doing no wrong, Mila Kunis on the other hand gave a magnificent performance, probably would win this years golden globes best Supporting Actress. Overall, its wonderfully assembled all together, making it one of the eminent movies in Hollywood. WATCH IT!!!!",10,2,5,8 January 2011
127 Hours," Five Star Head Trip Movie !!!
","Danny Boyle % James Franco at their best.. WOW!!!Danny (director) did an amazing job, his way of jumping between the scenes is magnificent, James did an Oscar nomination performance, applause to him. his best movie so far!The story is unbelievable, so is the movie. After seeing the trailer & getting intrigue,i thought its going to be one of those movies were you draw a blank of it after a year or two.127Hours is a true winner, a true reflection of our lives, as people, as species, as a humankind for survival.A MUST SEE MOVIE ALL AROUND !",9,0,3,8 January 2011
Edge of Tomorrow," Tom Cruise or whoever this is a MUST!!!!
","The actors in this film shows you why when you get the perfect gimmick between great actors and great screen writers with an awesome director you get an awesome cool movie. i watched this film expecting nothing, just a modern warfare big alien war, but as they say, never judge a book by its cover. Doug Liman ( the director) does a perfect job and the screen writers were just brilliant.Its hard to describe without putting any spoilers, i advise you to watch this movie, now or whenever, this is going into the history books, one of the best. a must watch guys!",10,2,5,28 September 2014
Inception," For Those Who Still Didn't Watch It!!!!!
","There is a great deal of movies, not hundreds, but thousands of movies, a lot of horror, drama, mystery, but only ONE Inception!!!From the beginning of the movie, you could feel its not a regular film, not one of those high budget action movies that excites you by throwing big explosions and gun shooting scenes like The Matrix or Die Hard.Not one of those where the actors did their roles perfectly but were weakened by the screenplay's in-competencies.Inception is perfect, a 148 mints movie that goes like 43 mints. as soon as the film commences, you just cant BLINK!!! cant turn your head. the acting, story, thrills, mystery, directing and soundtracks, all congregate together to create a PERFECT MASTERPIECE called INCEPTION!!!If you haven't watched it till now, go & rent or buy it, IT WILL CHANGE YOUR PERSPECTIVES !!!!",10,0,8,8 January 2011
The Fighter," A Christian Bale Movie .
","Finally after weeks of wanting to watch this movie, i had the chance to do so, specially after watching all of this years big anticipated Hollywood blockbusters that has 8+ rating on here.Overall its a good movie, but not what was expected of it, The Movie revolves about Ward's (Mark Wahlberg) Life. which is nice and very dramatic. the thing you wouldn't expect in a boxing movie. the fights are rare, the build up of the story is quit slow that leaves you a bit bored an hour into the movie.The only thing that entertained and lifted the movie to its high expectations is Christian Bale, WOW!!, a golden globe nomination performance. without him & his character this movie wouldn't be this special.In the end i do recommend this movie to boxing fans & A MUST to Christian Bale's lovers, but don't expect anything like Cinderella Man.",6,6,12,7 January 2011
