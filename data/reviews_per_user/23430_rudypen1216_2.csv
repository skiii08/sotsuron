It," Way past outstanding!!
","I know most people who read the book might disagree with me, but I'm glad this didn't copy off all of Kings novel. I love how this film did its own thing and left out the novels biggest spoilers. There were a lot of alternatives, but plenty of horror and perfect acting. Bill Skarsgard is just as much a nightmare as Tim Curry. (Neither actors are better than the other.) I'm definitely gonna go see this again, and I'm gonna buy it when it comes to blu ray!",10,10,21,8 September 2017
Justice League," A real team!!!
","Awesome movie with an awesome team of heroes! Outstanding acting, and terrific story line!!! I'm not good at telling how good CGI is in movies, but all the CGI complainers need to shut the hell up. Y'all always seem to think it's too easy to get all perfect. I thought it was plenty good enough. And this team could not have saved the day had they not all stuck together, which is my favorite thing about the movie. All 6 hero actors were perfect, although I wish Ben Affleck didn't do the deep voice like Christian Bale. Michael Keaton or Kevin Conroy never changed their voices. But anyways I can't wait for the next film of what Superhero in this Justice League universe.",10,1,3,28 November 2017
