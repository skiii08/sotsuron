Skyfall," The end of the typical bond movies and in to Oscar worthy bond movies.
","Skyfall is a film that signifies the end of the typical superman type bond movies.From all the 23 bond movies skyfall is a movie even a loyal classical bond movie fan would consider the best one.FOR me skyfall is the best not because of the cool action sequences or the cool cars but simple because of the story line.this is not a movie that bond simply get the girl and save the world from another weird disaster.This is a bond movie that even James bond breaks down under pressure.That even James bond have problems that a normal person have.In this movie the interpretation of James bond is more human. Sam Mendes is a master when it comes to creating masterpiece after watching skyfall it's obvious as to why Sam Mendes was selected to direct this movie.His interpretation of bond show the transcension of bond from past to present through out 50 years.After watching this movie it's obvious that this is not a stereotypical bond movie.With magnificent action sequences,drama and with a hint of comedy makes skyfall a well balanced movie.It's not a easy task to live up to 50 years of bond legacy but i think Sam Mendes has face the challenge magnificently.through his unique way of story telling i think he has honored the bond legacy. A main focus should be given to the acting of this movie.As usual Daniel Craig brings his gritty more emotional corrupted and brute force attitude to the bond character.Javier Bardem brings his Oscar winning performance to portray the bast bond villain in my book.overall skyfall is a amazing movie hopefully this unique interpretation of bond continues to future bond movies.",9,3,11,12 November 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," miles ahead from the first one.........
","In this installment spider man is against several villains and the struggle with them changes his life.the story has improved in so many ways form the first movie,where the story gives more character to spider man where it shows that spider man is more human and not just a comedic character which resulted from the first movie. as in every spider man movie special effects play a major role,and this movie takes it to the next level.it's such a delight to enjoy the special effect of the movie because it's truly amazing. also the movie maker has created some really good characters which really improved the quality of the story.Andrew Garfield give a good performance with a blend of comedy and drama.a special mentioned should be made to Dane DeHaan who plays Harry Osborn, provides a amazing performance with good character development.Jamie Foxx provides a good villain to the story .one negative side is that the use of Paul Giamatti ,where not much screen time is given to his character and hopefully he will become a part of future spider man projects. overall good movie ,good special effects ,good acting and a proper story and it has resulted a enjoyable spider man movie.",7,1,3,3 August 2014
Lucy," unexpected and smart........
","i went to this movie to see a copy of the movie limitless,but after watching it i can say it's not the same.there are some similarities between the two movies but the way the movie maker presented it is different.this is a more action packed version where the style and the methods that was used to make this movie really gives it a unique touch.A woman named Lucy at first portrayed as a party type typical girl and after an incident her world changes in a really fast way where she gains full capacity of her brain.the movie directly put the audience in the place of Lucy and after that it's nonstop action ride.events happens in a really quick way and the word boring can't be used in this movie.Scarlett Johansson who plays the female protagonist give a good performance which really suits the style of the movie.Morgan Freeman is playing the role which he played in several other movies recently.Min- sik Choi a veteran actor produces a reasonably good villain who goes against Lucy.however one draw back for me in this movie is the way Lucy was presented,where after some time the character Lucy becomes soo powerful no one becomes a match to her and at that point the movie losses the edge a bit.but considering the whole movie it's a minor draw back.this might not be a exceptional movie,but it is a really enjoyable movie.",7,4,13,4 August 2014
