It," Not scary
","This was just a remake of the first movie. I fell a sleep a couple of times. Just rehashing of the first movie. I should have stayed home and watch the original. There was nothing original about it, if you have watched the first IT, then you are going to be very disappointed.The actors were great, but it was so hyped up and I walked out wondering what the hype was about.",1,4,9,26 September 2017
