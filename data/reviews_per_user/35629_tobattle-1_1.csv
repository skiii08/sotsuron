Blade Runner 2049," Stunning!
","Rarely does a sequel come along holding true to the original like this one. The story line is so related to the original that you are instantly drawn to the characters with a twist here and a turn there. Thought provoking with cinematography and sound on such a grand scale as to blow your mind! A glimpse of what the world could be like if we're not careful and don't drink to much liquid, you might miss something.",9,2,7,10 October 2017
