Minority Report," Exited for but Disappointed
","First, I really like this movie. BUT!!!! I had been waiting for this movie and reading about it and following the production for several years. Now, this was before Tom Cruise when all alien worshiping on us, and he was making really good movies. When I read that he and Spielberg were teaming up for a movie based on a by Philip K. Dick, I was stoked! I had been talking to my friends about this and when it came out I got some of them to go with me to see it. As we walked out of the theater, one of them asked me if it was all I had hoped for and worth the wait . . . and at that moment I realized it had the Star Wars Episode I feel to it. I was expecting the greatest movie ever, and all I got was a movie that was 'good'. Not great or something a geek like me should be following and waiting for so long, just something 'good'. Maybe if I had not been so hyped for so long I would've liked it better. But, oh well, it's better than Kingdom of the Crystal Skull",7,0,0,21 May 2015
