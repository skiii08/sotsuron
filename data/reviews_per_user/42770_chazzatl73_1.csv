Hereditary," Great...Until the Ending
",This movie is a slow starter which is great because character development is amazing. The feel and tone of the movie's cinematography is amazing. Direction is great too. The story had so much potential that was basically thrown away when you discover the 'twist'. It is not a scare you out of your pants movie. It's way more suspenseful than horror.,7,5,13,8 June 2018
