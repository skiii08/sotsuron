Ali," Good work!!!!
","This was not as good as I thought it would have been, but Its brilliant work. I loved the beginning. I think Will Smith did a good job acting Ali. If you are interested in Muhammad Ali watch (Ali) its good. And his southern accent does not come and go. Like someone said so in a comment. Maybe the run in Zaire scene is a little long, but it doesn't spoil the movie. Thank you Michael Mann.",10,0,1,7 October 2003
