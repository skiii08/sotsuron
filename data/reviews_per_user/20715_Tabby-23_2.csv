The Blair Witch Project," Competent suspense film, but the creativity is overrated.
","I was looking forward to seeing this film, the reputation that preceded it reminded me of the Lovecraft style of horror. However, the innovation of the faux-documentary is watered down with numerous errors and flaws, not the least of which being *product*placement* in the beginning of a documentary! The scare are genuine, although one of the night sounds, once introduced, is over-used. The premise of the three hikers becoming lost also becomes increasingly implausible, with or without a witch chasing them. This *is* probably the scariest film this year, but the competition so far is lightweight at best. Some viewers will walk out of the film simply confused, since it requires concentration from the audience to achieve the full effects intended. However, if you pay attention too closely, the flaws in the film became too abvious. If you want to see a scary film, go ahead and see Blair witch. If you want to see the classic films that introduced the trick in Blair Witch, go rent Evil Dead & Wait Until Dark.",Null,0,1,6 August 1999
Pitch Black," NO FLAMETHROWERS!
","By now, everyone knows this is part of the Alien 'Puny Human' genre, where a group of people are forced to face an alien threat of the like never seen before. The difference here is that the director worked hard to get everything he could out of the limited budget. The nerve-wrackingly desolate landscapes are effectively turned into purely claustrophobic corridors of dark by what has to be the most spectacular eclipse scene ever in cinema. The special effects are either subtle or over the top, but they always achieve the effect on the audience the director wanted. Despite limited dialogue, the actors throw themselves right into character, explaining nothing that they can't demonstrate with their performance. Vin Diesel, in particular, makes himself an irresistably fascinating amoral predator, who deals with everyone at face value.What really impressed me, however, is that there were no flamethrowers. In his illustrations for Species, H.R. Giger kept scribling notes saying 'no flamethrowers', which were ignored. In fact, the flamethrower has become the worst cliche of the whole Alien genre, appearing everywhere from undersea mining facilities to L.A. sewers. Pitch Black avoids this crutch, impressive since flamethrowers would be doubly useful for the night-blind survivors fighting albino predators. The whole crew worked hard on this film, avoiding cheap tricks like this, and it shows.",10,0,0,22 February 2000
