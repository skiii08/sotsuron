Raiders of the Lost Ark," Top Flight Summer Action Movie!!
","I was at Disneyland the other day, and after riding the Indiana Jones ride, I had to watch this trilogy over again!! 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is the first movie in the Indiana Jones trilogy and it's also the best. It stars Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist who sets off to find the lost Ark of the Covenant, the chest that carried the Ten Commandments. He teams up with his ex-girlfriend, Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) and he dodges bullets, punches, Nazis and his arch-rival, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman) who is working with the the Nazis to find the ark. There are some pretty fantastic scenes in this movie, the beginning with the boulder, the plane-fight sequence and also the truck chase but I think the scene most connected with this movie is the end. Awesome movie and definitely one of the best to ever make it on film.Btw, the boulder is at the Disney ride too!",10,0,1,21 April 2012
The Last Samurai," Epic Adventure!
","Tom Cruise is in top form as a samurai warrior no less in this action packed adventure.The story revolves around a civil war vet in the 1800's Nathan Algren (Cruise in one of his better performance's since Michael Mann's Collateral). Nathan is sent to Japan to help the Japanese army fend off the Samurai, whom are being a real pain in the butt. Cruise being beaten in battle is now captured by them and learns their way of life from their leader Katsumoto (Watanabe). Nathan's eyes are opened to see who truly is the worse of the two, he is turned against the Japanese government and fights in one of the biggest sword swing, horse riding battles of all time (Just my opinion). Cruise and Watanabe give an electrifying performance in Edward Zwick's masterpiece The Last Samurai.",10,0,5,21 April 2012
