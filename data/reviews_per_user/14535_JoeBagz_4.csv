It," IT... should have been better
","ITNo spoilers. Pretty mediocre effort but a decent film based on a novel by Stephen King, which I have read several times since it was published. 
The Plot: A loose knit group of nerds come together to fight a monster from the past that returns to hunts children... eventually stalking them. It's a great plot, timeless even. Worked great as a novel, seems much more of a challenge as a film. 
Screenplay: was decent and had to have been a challenge to pick and choose scenes with so many characters to develop from a book that's almost 1200 pages long. That said the opening sequence was pretty creepy. 
Direction: Think the film starts to lose traction soon after when the director forces the actors who are kids to try and act like kids. Tried too hard to make them look and act like losers, made them sanitized versions of kids. Andres Muschietti and the cast should have watched the 1995 film 'Kids' before the shooting started. Lastly, many scenes drag on way too long, shock value goes away pretty quick. 
Cinematography: The film is shot in such a way that the audience never 'feel' like they're in the shot, more like they're just watching from a distance. Need to stay in your face, up real close for it to work.
The Climax: Again just mediocre and way too drawn out.
Overall worth a watch maybe but given the budget could/should have been a lot better.",4,1,1,23 January 2018
Wind River," Wind River - Why you go to the Movies - An Excellent Film
","No spoilers. Really, really good film. A thriller. The Plot: the body of a bare foot young woman found in the snow out miles from anything or anyone on a native American reservation. The screenplay. Tight, no wasted dialog, unnecessary characters or gratuitous overly long scenes. Characters are developed, frame by frame, fun to watch. Very well cast with wonderful performances by all. The cinematography is amazing, capturing a landscape that's beautiful, stark and frightening all at once. The writer/director Taylor Sheridan wove a story that grabs you in the first 2 minutes and hold you breathless till the final credits roll. Sheridan keeps you in the film, less like you're watching the action remote and safe more like you're right there just out of frame but close enough to feel the tension, feel the dread. An excellent film, somewhere way up there between 8 and 10 stars.",10,3,10,19 August 2017
Annihilation," Interesting Concept with Poor Execution
","No spoilers. Not very good. SCI-FI. Plot: A college biology professor signs up for a secret expedition to explore the shimmer, a slowly expanding zone from which nothing returns. The screenplay is based on a novel by Jeff VanderMeek which I did not read. While the premise sounds reasonable and some explanations of events offered by characters touring the zone are pretty interesting very little the characters attempt in the film over the 115 minutes makes any sense at all. These plot holes happen repeatedly and undermine the story. The response by government to the threat, the team they assemble, the supplies they carry or the objectives of their mission are all lame. Like watching teens in a slasher film, it get's old pretty quick. Am guessing writer/ Director Alex Garland best known for excellent work on Ex Machina kept the story a bit too close to the book this time. Decent cast too. This might have worked better in the 60's when the audience might have been less likely to question why the actions of the characters make less sense than does an alien environment we can only speculate about.",3,0,1,2 June 2018
Alien: Covenant," Alien: Covenant... Does Not Deliver
","No spoilers. Here's the thing, Alien: Covenant is a sequel in an anxiously anticipated trilogy but also the latest edition in the 4-decade long Alien series of films. This association/connection to the past brings not just anticipation and excitement but enormous expectations that the story/screenplay utterly fails to deliver on. Even as a stand alone sci-fi film the story line would present issues to any adult audience. The crew supposedly trained an extensive period of time for their mission but their lack of critical thinking about anything is difficult to get past. All the more surprising because the very talented director Ridley Scott also directed the original Alien film back in 1979. He's familiar with the story so what happened with this mess??? Casting is only so so, perhaps with a better story their individual talents could have made a difference but they collectively didn't work here, not at all like a crew and way too stupid/obtuse to believe. Did like Katherine Waterston though. The one positive aspect of the film is the CGI, it's great. To be honest a huge part of the problem for me, fair or not, is that Alien: Covenant is tied to the conclusion and promise made by its predecessor, Prometheus. The ongoing search for answers to where we come from and how humans evolved from the advanced civilization we presume to be responsible. All I'll say is regrettable they totally blew it off. Too bad.",2,3,5,29 August 2017
