The Blair Witch Project," Skip it!
","'The Blair Witch Project', in my opinion, does not live up to it's hype. After being billed as one of the creepiest movies ever made, I went expecting something more suspenseful or scary. What I got was a film which, although the last 3-5 minutes raised the hairs on the back of my neck, could have been titled 'Three Kids Get Lost In The Woods And Say F**k Alot'. My wife and I almost missed the ending because we were fighting so hard to stay awake. I found the Sci-Fi Channel special, 'Curse of the Blair Witch', to be much more frightening because it gives much more of the background stories about the legend of the witch, Coffin Rock and the child murderer in the 1940's. If you want my advice, get a copy of 'Curse of the Blair Witch' from the Sci-Fi Channel, wait for 'The Blair Witch Project' to come out on video, rent it for $3 (instead of paying $16+ to see it at the movies), fast forward to the last 15 minutes, watch 'Curse...' and then watch the last 15 minutes of the video. THEN you'll have a very scary experience!",Null,1,1,20 August 1999
