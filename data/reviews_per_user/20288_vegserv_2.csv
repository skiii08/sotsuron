Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Another pan
","I too was very disappointed by this movie and here's why:1.  Editing:  Most of the shots in this movie seemed to go at rapid-fire pace, uncharacteristic of the other three movies which often had long, slow, loving shots--think Luke looking out at the double sunset on Tatooine, John Williams' slow dramatic score in the background.  Phantom Menace looks like it was filmed by an MTV crew.2.  Jake Loyd:  He was way too young.  Anakin should have been 12-14. Yoda's concern that he is too old to begin Jedi training would make more sense, not to mention his piloting of the pod, future romance with Amidala, tension with Obi-Wan, etc.  He was also written too happy.  We should have been given a glimpse of a brooding adolescent or some small act of cruelty--he's too innocent.3.  Midochlorians:  Force germs?!  This is terribly disturbing.  I will surely get a lot of disagreement, but Star Wars is NOT Sci-Fi.  I repeat, STAR WARS IS NOT SCIENCE FICTION!!  It is Epic, a different genre with a different asthetic.  Don't believe me?  Compare the trilogy to Star Trek which is Sci-Fi through and through.  Epic doesn't require explanations for things like the Force--it is mystical, not scientific or biological.4.  The special effects:  Overdone.  Overkill.  Nothing looked real. They're just not that convincing.  It looked very cartoonish.  I like real sets and real actors.5.  The cast:  As mentioned in other reviews, they were quite wooden.  Not enough Darth Maul (too bad he was killed off, what an interesting villain he could be).  And I'm not sure Qui-Gon was completely necessary.  R2 and C3PO shouldn't have been in it.  Or at least they should have left out that dumb R2 award ceremony, that was insulting to our intelligence.6.  The politial machinations:  Something was awkward about how this part of the plot was handled.  It seemed much simpler in the first movies.7.  Jar Jar8.  And other things:  Tatooine seemed too populated.  The top of a skyscraper seems an unlikely place for the Jedi council.  Why did the Jedi Council travel all the way to Naboo at the end?  Anakin and his mother seemed to have an awful lot of freedom for slaves.  Why would battle droids have to talk aloud to each other or have to see holograms to get orders? Lando communicated straight to that guy's head in Empire and we knew what was going on because the viual storytelling was clear.I'm willing to give the movie a little slack in that more of it might make more sense later once we see the other two prequels.  Also, it is hard to live up to the expectations we had built up for it.  And I am willing to buy the Jedi Council's ignorance of Palpatine's evil ways because hard to see the dark side is.  The only things I found truly better than in the originals were the light saber battles.  They were well choreographed, executed, and shot.  In a storytelling sense they showed us what well trained Jedis in their prime could do back in the golden age of the Republic, something only hinted at in the first movies.",Null,0,1,22 June 2001
Princess Mononoke," Holy $#!@% do I hate anime!
","Let me start off by informing you of my prejudice against anime.  I don't have any conceptual or philosophical differences with it, it just grates on my nerves.  Nonetheless, I felt compelled to watch this movie, given the rave reviews by critics, its acclaim by the film students I know, its notable American voiceover stars, and the fact that my stoner friends popped it in the DVD player so it was either watch it or leave.Well, several root-canal painful hours later I felt I could hate anime in a whole new light.  I came away thinking that the movie did indeed have impressive animation that I still find obnoxious and tackled some environmental issues in a heavy handed way.  I thought that if American drawn characters could have been put onto the lusciously drawn backgrounds and the shrill jeremiads the characters were always launching into replaced with more subtle dialogue then I could at least give it a 5 out of 10 for not completely p***ing me off.But lo and behold I was wrong.  Or so I was informed by some pretentious anime fan.  Apparently all the environmental subject matter is really just a Western construct being super-imposed onto the movie by audiences who don't understand Shinto mythology.  Well Lah-dee-frickin-dah.  You mean I didn't even understand it?  Excuse me for not having a degree in Asian studies, but I don't think that should be a requirement to see friggin cartoon.  Am I uneducated and insensitive to Japanese film making?  Have I misunderstood Kurosawa's movies all these years?  Was I suckered in by the lack of constant yelling and screaming?  Was I merely projecting Western values onto his characters?  Or was he really a genuinely good director who could make movies about people from another place and time that transcend seemingly disparate cultures?Luckily, I don't think this film will ever supersede cult status so the rest of us who are too 'mainstream' won't have to suffer through it again. Call me crazy, but I like the Coen Brothers, Coppola, Levinson, Whit Stillman, and of course Kurosawa.",1,13,112,22 April 2001
