Deja Vu," 'Hey, i think we've seen this film before'
","I have a problem with 'travel back in time films'. If you go back in time you have the potential of killing your father or another ancestor hence your 'future' existence is impossible. What happens if you 'meet' yourself? That being said this was a great action picture with a breathtaking opening scene. It will definitely be one for the DVD player to pause/rewind and watch it in slow motion.Denzel Washington plays the archetypal, non-conformist, 'ill do it myway coz i'm smarter than you' ATF agent as Doug Carlin. I'm not sure why the ATF were involved in a terror attack or even the FBI. Surely it would have been Homeland Security who would have carried out the investigation? He gets recruited to join a top secret FBI operation that has found a way of viewing events from the 4.5 days ago as they happen 'live'. Of course it uses masses of electricity and has been used to explain the various North American blackouts that have occurred over the years.As a sub-plot he is also assigned to solve the mysterious murder of a very attractive young lady, Claire Kuchever, who appears to have died from injuries similar to the terror attack victims. Doug is like a dog with a bone and won't let go of his hunch. With the FBI and their super viewer he tracks down the terrorist and brings him to justice. The FBI 'powers that be' then orders that the 'viewer' be shut down because the case is solved.At this point I thought we might be in for a typical 'conspiracy theory 'the Govt was behind the attack' tangent. But no. Doug goes off on his quest to save Claire and win her heart.Provided that you don't think too much about the whole travel back in time thing then this movie is fast paced and well done.",7,0,1,2 January 2007
Finding Nemo," Fishy goings on.
","This film tells the unlikely story of Marlin, a Clown fish, losing his son 'Nemo' and the journey he embarks on to be re-united with him.
The computer animation of the fish in this film is superb.  The human animation is less amazing.  I took my 8 and 13 year old daughters to see this film and they both enjoyed it.  Personally I object to films where animals are given human characteristics or behaviour.  The story is quite simply weak and lacks any of the adult humour found in Shrek and Toy Story. In fact some of the very young children in the cinema started to get restless during some of the 'slower' points of the film.",Null,0,0,21 October 2003
Crash," Chaos theory in the real world
","Crash is one of those films that you will have to watch more than once. Not because it is complicated in the way that the Usual Suspects or LA Confidential are but because you will miss the minutae.The film deals with racial prejudice in LA. I cannot believe, from a UK perspective, that it is quite as overt in real life as is portrayed in the film. It blows away the wide held view amongst the liberal-left that racism is only one way: white on black. In the film everyone is racist and abusive to anyone from a different race or skin colour.Racism is a basic human reaction. Its the dog hates the cat, cat hates the mouse of the human world. You are different from me. Maybe you are a threat to me. You have been given more advantages than I have because of your racial background. Result is I dislike/hate you.This is the basis of the film which moves quickly although in reality nothing much happens. I was worried that as the film was approaching the climax that the director would give the film a sacharrine ending and everyone would realise the futility of racial prejudice. Thankfully he didn't.There are no nice guys in this film.",9,2,8,19 September 2005
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," Deeply thought provoking
","It didn't start well with clipped English accents and the domesticity of life it could have been filmed in England. As it was the story opens in Berlin where 8 year old Bruno comes back from school to his palatial home to find a party being prepared.His father has been promoted and the family are celebrating. There's a slight disappointment for Bruno and his sister Gretchen as they are to move to the country far away from any towns or other people.The new house is a dark and foreboding as the secret 'farm' at the end of the garden. Bruno is bored and like most boys of his age he likes to explore and so off he goes into the woods until he comes a cross a wire fence. The other side of which is a boy his age. They talk and soon a friendship builds up. At the same time, his mother is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with her husband's new job and what it involves. When the young lieutenant living with them comments 'they smell even worse when they burn' she finally goes off the rails.Plans are then made for mum and the children to move back to a city that is safe from allied bombardment and more a suitable location to bring up children. Eventually the day when they are due to leave arrives and Bruno disappears with devastating consequences.",9,1,2,11 April 2009
Love Actually," Should be called Naff Actually
",Ok I admit I am not really a fan of sloshy romantic comedies having disliked Notting Hill and Bridget Jones' Diary.  I went to see 'Love Actually' partly to please/acompany my wife and partly because of the impressive cast list.It was entirely predictable from the typecast Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) who always plays himself to the ten year old love struck boy.  At ten most boys don't even realise girls exist so it is extremely rare for one to fall head over heals in love.I am not sure how seriously the writer meant us to take the film but it was the comment by Mr Grant during the opening seconds of the film that almost made me vomit.  After that I knew it would be down hill for the rest of the film.There were a number of amusing scenes but for the most part I sat there waiting for the credits to appear.,Null,1,3,22 December 2003
Lord of War," Unexpected docudrama
","Reading the other reviews for this film it seems that either I missed the point or I was expecting something else. Apparently the film is based on actual events.The film starts off as a monologue for the first twenty minutes or so with Uri Orlov talking about his life and how he got into the arms business. Eventually dialogue starts but throughout the film Uri also acts as storyteller.If the film is trying to make a point it does so only partly: The Arms trade is bad and the people fueling the various global/local conflicts are bad but not nearly as bad as the major arms dealers: USA, UK etc. Yes we know that, what's new? The film is quite graphic and while it does show the horror war at the local level, fails to offer a solution - assuming there is one. The only solution would be a global ban on sales of any weapons that may be used in any conflict. Probably about as achievable as proving the existence of God. As Uri states; 'If I don't do it somebody else will'. His rival, when asked why he supplied both sides in the Iran/Iraq war replied: 'Maybe I wanted them both to lose.' Of all the conflicts covered, Liberia & Sierra Leone show the hopelessness of collapsed states run by powermad bloodthirsty lunatics. Until the Western powers stop dealing with and supplying weapons to the murderous leaders the conflicts will continue.Not an enjoyable film or a particularly good documentary.",4,5,13,25 October 2005
Slumdog Millionaire," Best film in a very long time.
","You can tell that a film was really good. The time passes really quickly and you don't want it to end.The film is told in real time and in flashbacks. It is basically an episode of Who Wants to be a Millionaire in India. The top prize is 20 million Rupees, or just short of £300,000. In a country where the average wage is around £1500 per year this is a fortune. It centers on the life of Jamal and his brother Salim. The fact that both made it to adulthood given their start in life is a miracle. Growing up in the slums of Mumbai the boys face obstacles and life threatening situations from birth. Orphaned and left to fend for themselves these street kids live from day to day. Eventually they link up with Latika, herself an orphan.We switch between present day and the past as Jamal recounts how he came to appear on WWTBAM and how he knew the answers to the questions. He's recounting them to a senior policeman after being tortured because the show's presenter thinks he is cheating. No one has ever got as far as Jamal on the program.This is a truly brilliant film. It really has earned the accolades and awards it has won or has been nominated for.This is not a bollywood film where every one breaks into song every five minutes. If your wife or gf wants you to see it then do so.",10,1,5,26 January 2009
