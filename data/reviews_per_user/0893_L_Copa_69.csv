The Rock," Just look at the cast.... What a great movie...
","Nicolas Cage with Sean Connery and Ed Harris? What can you say about this starts... They took a simple script with an average directing, a great important issue and they turned it into gold! Great acting that led to awesome action and funny scenes! Definitely the kind of movies you watch again and again!",8,2,3,5 May 2019
Angels & Demons," I feel this trilogy had so much potential but this one really lost it...
",Tom hanks was acting smart in this movie and barely hold us to the screens with his great duo Ian McKellen but the whole script and the directing weren't in their favour... Half of the movie is interesting but the rest is boring and doesn't thrill at all.,5,1,1,29 January 2020
Captain Phillips," As a movie fan and an Officer i find this Brilliant!
","I guess it is impossible to watch Tom Hank's serious movies and not cry... The whole movie is awesome in acting, in dialogues, in directing in photography , in maritime terms , in action movies, everywhere!Totally deserve an oscar. Tom Hanks acting is stunning in this movie and as an Marine officer i found it thrilling, educational, smart, emotional with tons and tons of suspense. A true story that needed to be shown in the big screen!",9,1,1,29 January 2020
The Expendables 2," Just when you thought we ran out of good villains...
","When people say you cant make a good sequel with action, new sense of humor and limitless action, Stallone replied : Here we are! Jean Claude Van Damme's addition to the cast was the best thing happened to the villain club. He really pulled out some new hate face for this one and really gave a good battle as a villain. Here at the sequel we had extra badass casting like Norris, Adkins , you name it... All stars where here to deliver pure unique entertainment, bombing and destruction!",10,0,0,26 March 2020
50 First Dates," So sad that it will make you happy...
","What if you cant remember your first date, or your first day, or your first love, or the person you love... Love is in the air! Really inspiring, emotional, adventurous, sad and above all epic. Nice performances. Script rolls out really well and entertaining. Must watch!",8,2,2,3 December 2019
Catch Me If You Can," Knock Knock! Who's there? Success.
","Its one of those unique movies that you can call the writer genius. Beautiful story- telling and great acting from our stars Tom Hanks and LD. The series of events dont reveal the whole story and they dont hold back too much. It manages to combine small comedy dialogues with smart story, pursuit, mystery, fraud, justice, relationships and many many other things. It is a multi-dimensional movie with many point of views. Just sit back and enjoy!",9,1,2,21 January 2020
Hereditary," Damn, it could be awesome...
","The movie was not that bad... It slowly creates its own story ( too slow for me) and it builds a tension, something that will go under your skin with all this drama... It will make you sad and shock you and then at the end it will scare you a little bit... It's not a usual jump scare but if you put yourself in there it is kind of scary... The plot and the way the story goes is good but it might bore you... The end wasn't that satisfied but it was realistic! Give it a shot it might be a classic for you like the old ones... It didn't give me that sensation though...",6,3,8,24 June 2019
Gravity," Wow i never though it would be that bad...
",I saw that George Clooney and Sandra Bullock star in this.... But damn their acting was so average... The script was extremely poor and the music was bad. It has some great images and potential but it is meaningless. It has no good start or ending... the entire movie makes you tired even though it lasts only one hour and thirty minutes. I do not recommend this movie. It is a waste of time. Perfect example of how fake Oscar awards have become.,1,1,3,28 July 2018
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A fine addition to the installments but that it...
","This movie based on its involvement, its directing , its cinematography in a way of speaking , reminds us a star wars film but it fails to be a classic like the others or deliver similar feelings. You can watch it with your friends one night have fun but that's about it... Characters aint passionate or make you feel casual, not thrilling villains, just some plain enjoyable action. A one or two times movie...",6,0,0,31 January 2020
Captain Marvel," Just a good story...
","It had it's good moments but the whole thing was kinda random without sequence in events, without evolving the scenario. Samuel Jackson was good and saved the movie but for an OP superhero like Captain Marvel nothing persuaded me that she is worth it... It might bore you a little bit but It's Marvel so i know that you ll give it a chance!",6,1,4,9 June 2019
The English Patient," Very, very bad script and horrible execution...
","I do not recommend this movie. A simple idea in almost 3 hours without any real affection, no love, no drama , no tears , no meaning, no revenge, no war, pretty much NOTHING! It ended up being boring and it achieved nothing towards the viewers.. It is just a meaningless narration...",2,3,5,7 February 2020
The Notebook," The greatest romantic movie ever existed! Period!
","I've seen this movie 10 times so far, every single time tears come to my eyes! Every time different feeling, every time different scene. The script, the cast the directing, the dialogues, the drama, the motivation, the obsession... All leading to love. Realistic, romantic, dramatic, heart breaking and above all epic! It has literally everything inside. Dont miss it!",10,1,2,5 January 2020
Us," Boring directing and terrible script...
",This movie made me and i believe many other bored and the end wasn't that good to compensate that... The character's development and the directing was really poor and messy and the whole thing doesn't frighten you or make you feel you are in the movie... It is an idea presented really wrong... It doesn't offer something new and i won't see it again....,1,0,0,10 June 2019
Knives Out," Finally a good fun Mystery
","Good plot twists, great casting , good script by man Daniel's accent ruined my mood at the start. Despite that I enjoyed the whole movie and stayed still during the whole case. Directing was really good, in favour of the actors. Maybe a smart script could make the sequel desire true!",8,0,1,24 April 2020
The Irishman," I don't usually rate 1 star but man this was way too boring and pointless...
","We ve seen countless mafia and true stories mafia movies... Some of the good some of them bad... But following the same recipe with these 2 titans of acting and Scorsese behind without giving something new and entertaining or at least meaningful, is a crime... No disrespect but it seems like these old legends arent trying hard enough... Its like they are reading a script and thats all... I DONT know if it is the character and its lack of soul that makes them fall into that but this movie is way too boring, unnecessary and over-hyped due to nostalgia with this duo. Dont waste your time or money...",1,4,13,5 December 2019
Creed," Why Creed is a great Rocky sequel
","Creed is an excellent 10 rated movie for many reasons guys and girls.First of all it is really great that after 40 years Sylvester Stallone is back as Rocky and as a trainer.I would say that it is a 'must'.He is now what Mickey was to him and i believe that's very important.I believe so and Sly believes it too thats why we have in the film some quotes connected to previous Rocky films.I admit it, this movie made me cry at many scenes.I was really really surprised by this magnificent acting from Sylvester Stallone.This is a real life movie with many lessons, an inspiring one that motivates people nowadays.It is so so sure that people will watch this movie again and again after time.I recommend all of you to see it and rate it so we can thank Sylvester Stallone's work and encourage him for a sequel that has been heard.",10,2,7,2 February 2016
Dead Poets Society," Great act, scenario, life lessons. Totally recommended
","I was surprised by the great act of my lovely Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke and of course Robin Williams. This movie is so powerful and emotional. It makes you think so many things for life, for situations, people and many more. It holds you till its latest scene. Is is like a true story of the old decades, what was like back then and how it is now. You can learn so many things from this great scenario. You will be motivated by this movie and maybe you'll learn a thing or two about poetry.",9,0,0,26 November 2017
Terminator Salvation," An action movie that didnt offer too much to the franchise...
","OK ignore the Haters from James Cameron blind fans. The movie isn't terrible or unwatchable. It is a good action movie with a weak scenario, because it focused a lot on the safety of Kyle Reese. It could offer more to the timeline with John Conor's importance and the new machine's contribution. I feel it was supposed to be more complicated and focus on the machines and the morality and human decisions!",6,0,1,6 October 2019
The Terminator," A must classic for all Future generations!
","James Cameron with Arnold Schwarzenegger achieved to make the impossible in a time of middle CGI, sci fi, and technology! That is making a story, with perfect directing and acting, pure bad-ass action with manly quotes and moves! It is one thing that we always joke about, about the machines and here it is presented as the beginning of all. Sarah Conor is magnificent at this role. It is a movie that we re all gonna see repeatedly in our lives. It is the definition of the word classic. So... Nice night for Terminator!!! ( for a walk)",9,0,1,3 October 2019
Ocean's Twelve," This one was kinda boring ... Not a great sequel but watch it when you have time...
",Casting looked pretty bored in this sequel and the movie itself was a little bit long! Average directing and not smart at all... Not a great sequel but watch it when you have time just to know the whole story for the next one!,6,1,2,30 March 2019
The Expendables," Pure action that we were all dreaming!
","It is so cool that Sylvester Stallone managed to write something that brought together all the action starts for the ultimate action series. The first of the installment started really good, with a telling story, with a villain that had a purpose and a crew that was one hundred percent bad-ass. All the action fighting scenes, the dialogues , the image of each character was perfect and set the scene for evolution to the good guys! If you are a die hard fan of old time classic action heroes , this modern action piece of story will keep you company every year!",9,0,0,26 March 2020
Closer," This is where you get involved!!! Well done!
","It is a movie that you connect, a movie that you relate with the stars, you feel them, you pity them, you envy them and you re constantly thinking who s gonna end up with whom. It makes you mad and you are in some sort of high tension and suspense about the future and how it is going to roll out. The cast is simply amazing. Directing side by side with good acting and boom we had a success here. One of the best soundtracks ever to surround this beautiful script. Movie cinema at its best!",8,0,0,15 February 2020
Ocean's Thirteen," It's true what they say... Better than 12 but nowhere near 11.
",Al Pacino nailed it with his acting. he could do more but I guess that's the script- that's the acting. It was better than oceans 12 but not better than oceans 11. Watch it to complete this nice story but you won't be thrilled,6,0,1,31 March 2019
Interstellar," Very original script, Great Directing, Stunning acting!
","Wow what a performance from Matthew McConaughey !! Maybe Oscar worthy! A well written original script with this great directing makes viewer's mind to blow! The only bad thing is the music... For me terrible choices for music.... It could have been epic... A plot that wanders in people's minds for decades! Ann and Julia Roberts were a great addition in the cast. I wanted Caine's and Matt Damon's roles a little bit different but ok, watchable!",8,0,5,3 December 2019
Rocky II," The true definition of Sequel...
","True talent out there... Written, Directed and starred by Sylvester Stallone. We re talking about a beautiful cinematography story here, with Rocky pushing his limits even when life hits him hard and nobody believes in him. Another step to high motivation, drama and much much more. Nice choreography, awesome fight, really thrilling that makes you anxious! Training really inspiring and stunning performance by Burgles Meredith! A really amazing sequel to the first masterpiece.",10,0,0,30 March 2020
Forrest Gump," Maybe one of the most powerful movies ever...
","Tom Hank's oscaric performance gave this beautiful script another sensation. It is one of those movies that can change your life, in many ways... So many emotional stories into this one story. So dramatic, so powerful and inspiring at the same time. It can be a personal movie or a family movie that you can see again and again... Hope all of you can appreciate its meaning and never give up no matter what. No need to talk about it's amazing soundtrack because you re gonna cry!",10,2,2,1 November 2019
The Godfather: Part II," 1/3 of the movie was great but the rest was boring for me...
","I thought this one was gonna be better than the first one but its not. For me they didn't handled correctly Robert De niro, they put unnecessary scenes to Al Pacino's performance and generally the movie is once again way too long. I dont know what is it with mafia movies and they make it 3,5 hours but they dont create the perfect crime, vendetta or the conspiracy for their personal survival, or to create an empire or something or even protect their blood. I think they missed it all. There were good elements inside but they were shadowed by the boring scenes.",4,2,6,14 October 2019
Justice League," A good start and just an enjoyable movie! Recommended!
","Personally I cannot understand why people show so much hate and can't just enjoy a movie. Everybody nowadays is looking for flaws but let me tell you something about DC Universe and this movie specifically. From Man of Steel BvS and WW we have many good moments scenes emotions and things that we always imagine our heroes do like in the animations. Sure, they are not perfect and they could be better but damn me if did't enjoy those movies. I found Justice League just a good movie, introducing some of our beloved heroes together.We had a lot of action, a little humor and a good enough CGI. I found BvS better even though some people say it was Dark... Even if it was too much it was still great with a good scenario, great CGI and fights scenes and story!I suggest you support and go watch this film because you will enjoy it 100%. Show some support and studios will make a great DC universe for us. Don't be a hater and always seeking flaws. Don't choose sides between Marvel or DC. Just enjoy and love movies!",8,1,5,17 November 2017
The Matrix Revolutions," They rushed for this one...
","Sure action, Keanu and plot were interesting but the execution wasn't that great... Especially after the first diamond of the trilogy... It is very entertaining, with good fight scenes good CGI good dialogues but it lacks some elements to make it unforgettable... Despite all these its definitely one of the movies you see again and again if you start the whole trilogy.",6,1,1,31 January 2020
Cast Away," Wilson will stay with you forever!
","I wasnt thrilled with it but as days were passing i kept thinking about this movie! It is so well directed, with an absolutely stunning performance by Tom Hanks that you are going to remember it forever! It is very positive that it starts by building some story, creating some romance and then it becomes survival, emotional and dramatic! Some scenes are classic, a true piece of art! Ending could go to 2 directions but the writer wasn't too greedy and he made the reasonable , logical decision, that tells a lot about this love story! That was good too!",10,0,0,23 September 2019
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," A good Terminator action sequel but it could be so much more.
","It is a worthy sequel with new quotes, great action and a good evolution of the characters, machine and humans but the story was incomplete. We wanted at the 3d installment a more complicated plot with time, machines, villains , betrayal everything. And maybe some Sarah visions. Arnold was really good at this one too but the movie could give so much more to the franchise. No hate though movie is really entertaining to watch from time to time. Dont listen to James Cameron's blind fans...",8,2,2,5 October 2019
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Is this one of the best classics in the history of cinemas???
","Arnold and James Cameron haven't made a worthy sequel... They created a masterpiece of sci fi combined with awesome action, timelines, story-lines emotions everything.... We could also say it was the beginning of quotes. Acting is good Arnold gave us a perfect machine while making us crying... Because that last scene will be one of the most iconic scenes in the history of cinema. Not only that but T2 sets the time for many good sequels, especially with time wraps and good or bad villains, human or machines... Directing here is pure art. Honestly i dont know if this could have been done better....",10,2,2,5 October 2019
Rocky IV," Adrenaline at its max....
","An addition to the first trilogy that keeps you out of your seat for more than an hour! Memorable soundtracks, love, doubt, sadness, determination, like a cold combated soldier! Rocky reached a phase that it ain't about the belt, its about the people surrounding the sport, people that he loves. People for whom he will take revenge. Training and fight scenes perfectly choreographed and executed! Short length so it doesn't bore you and a performance from Dolph Lundgren that opened his career. Casting once again amazing! Directing is also good enough!",10,0,0,30 March 2020
Face_Off," Really awesome directing and great performance as always! Don't miss it!
","Nicolas Cage gave another great performance which combines with this directing and make the movie roll so smoothly. Great action, emotion scenes, funny conversations, twists and the music is fine too. Don't miss it due to the bad trailer. Travolta is also great at this movie!",9,0,0,5 May 2019
Ocean's Eleven," Finally a smart robbery with cool dialogues!
","I loved the cast and their smart cool conversations! Pretty smart and amusing! Good directing and good acting from everyone! If you want a movie to be entertained with your company, here you are!",8,1,2,30 March 2019
No Strings Attached," A duo we always wanted...
","Movie was relaxing, entertaining with a realistic sense of humor, and a love story really pleasant to observe. Ashton Kutcher is always a great choice for this kind of films and he connected really smoothly with Natalie Portman. The script though felt incomplete. No emotion there... Just entertainment...",7,0,0,26 April 2020
Legends of the Fall," What a powerful movie!
","Very emotional, dramatic and historic movie that is gonna make you cry! Stunning performances from the legendary Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt! Picture at its best and directing that will travel you to other unknown places ... I loved the way the story evolved till the very end... Didnt feel they were overreacting or bored. Dont miss it!",8,0,1,12 December 2019
Saving Private Ryan," Damn why did you have to ruin a good start?
","This is one of the movies that started really good , historical and as a classic war/survival movie with a lot of action and emotions with a leading Tom Hanks but somewhere along the line the plot was lost and there was no destination. It became pointless and not interesting at all, especially for it's duration. Even Tom Hanks cant save it all but i can see why its a classic for a lot of people.",3,2,7,29 January 2020
Avengers: Infinity War," I didn't expect it that low...
","Let's be honest. You will all go and you should go see the movie. But, we have to admit that for Marvel, its very disappointing. Too far unnecessary battles, some heroes were useless and unnecessary and ''klise'', like girl doesn't kill one 'man' compared to half a universe, Thor's axe from wood, unexplained scenes, divided teams and too many scenes with useless information. CGI and Thanos was great. Most of the heroes like Dr Strange, Iron Man, Thor, Spider man were great. Others weren't. Let's hope the second part will be better.",10,2,7,30 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Well if you re a normal person and not a blind Tarantino fan, you're gonna be dissapointed....
","This is not a usual Tarantino movie, and with all these famous actors he should have done something. Instead he made a movie without a story, boring sequence, meaningless scenes and half a plot. A couple of acting were good but the whole experience is tragic. A waste of time and money. Ain't worth nearly 3 hours. Sorry Tarantino... You have failed....",2,5,8,14 August 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Directing, scenario is awful, acting is extremely bad and it is meaningless and unsightly
","When i heard that this movie is talking about the sexuality between two men, i thought i will finally see a movie that shouts. Not only it was bad, but it is unsightly, with horrible acting, terrible plot and an incomplete end. It is almost unwatchable. It is the opposite of the movie Moonlight. It doesn't represent anything, it doesn't explain the emotions or preferences of these people and it does not trigger any of ours.",1,41,113,29 January 2018
Invictus," Serious script , light acting...
","This movie ladies and gentlemen touches on a serious subject, one that changed human's history for people... Serious script with great casting, good acting but light to provoke and awaken the rest of us... Plot rolls out great but there is no multidimensional problems so Nelson Mandela shows his character... It surrounds only one ... A good movie indeed, a lesson of life for some out there.",7,0,0,1 February 2020
La La Land," Why did you have to destroy a good romantic and inspiring movie with so much musical?
","I know that these type of movies are not for everyone, I realize that it can be boring and that is what happened with me, but it doesn't have to be for everyone. If you re not a demanding guy, if you re a patient viewer with a cigar relaxing at his sofa yes you might be thrilled. Despite that, i Think that Ryan's and Emma's good performance was wasted because it had such a good dramatic/ romantic story that led to motivation and a pure inspiring movie relation to music. I agree it had to be with music and acting but without so many musical songs every couple of minutes. I think the direction was quite poor and the lighting wasn't that great. Its one of those movies i guess that half of the crowd won't ever see again and the other half will re-watch.",4,1,1,8 September 2019
Rocky," The most inspirational movie ever!
","A masterpiece that will last forever. A realistic motivational story of an underdog in real and non real life that makes it through and achieves his dreams. A story that grew many generations and was made with real sweat and blood! Sylvester Stallone wrote a wonderful story and found the perfect casting for it. Lets keep in mind that it is kinda a real story from his personal life and wasn't that easy to shoot. Movie was finished in a couple of months if not in 1, it was 3. The whole saga is absolutely perfect with mixed emotions, drama, tears, love , fight, lessons of life, unsurpassed acting and a life portrayal that will change your life.",10,0,0,26 March 2020
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," Liked it more than the 1st. Loved Stallone's participation!
","I have to admit, Marvel has an emotional action story out there which is serving really nice to the whole MCU. Good combination of action and humor . Kid- friendly movie that you can see all over again from times to times. Chris Pratt was good at his part. Loved Stallone's scenes here. And let's not forget one of the most memorable quotes...",6,1,1,26 March 2020
The Da Vinci Code," 2 great performances with an incomplete script!
","Tom Hanks and Ian McKellen gave an outstanding performance! Movie was written for them! That mystery, church puzzle with a little bit of murder a little bit of hunt and some intelligence is exactly what we wanted but the direction wasn't to supportive to this! There was no flow for me, especially in the historic events and stories I felt like they were spread through the entire movie with no purpose. I believe it needed something, to give some tension to the viewer. Good movie though.",6,0,0,23 September 2019
Rocky III," Wow, Sylvester Stallone never lets down at Rocky!
","Once again Sylvester Stallone took directing , writing and casting on his shoulders and managed to deliver an amazing sequel! One of the most famous soundtracks that motivated many generations accompanied with the best training from the 80's and the funniest and toughest fights ,gave us an amazing entertainment. Mr T and Hulk Hogan is far , the best pick for Rocky's opponents that really stood up against him! The whole concept contender against the champion is smart and the script was evolved nicely around it , by bringing Apollo back to the script!",10,0,1,30 March 2020
The Matrix Reloaded," Adequate enough for a sequel to the 1st masterpiece.
","Action is getting better and better, script is following the first one in a good way. Keanu delivers as always, characters are getting deeper and deeper but of course low compared to the first masterpiece. It build the bridge though for the final movie but not an exact storyline to make it a super sci fi action classic.",7,1,1,1 February 2020
The Holiday," Bad execution....
",Sorry bad with this cast the movie should be way better.... Good idea but the directing is terrible and the final outcome even more.... It lacks pretty much everything and lacks the ability to draw out some romantic feelings or emotions... Boring for my taste.,3,0,6,3 December 2019
Steve Jobs," Good acting good idea but 2 hours long made it boring
",If you re a fan of Michael Fassbender watch this movie because his acting was really great! Personally i liked more the Jobs movie from Ashton Kutcher because it has a better row in events and the whole character evolves in every scene. The scenario is pretty good but the movie lasts 2 hours and that makes you bored because here it is not pleasant or clear how Steve evolves through the years.,6,0,0,29 November 2017
12 Years a Slave," It meant to be hardcore, it meant to shock you...
","A must movie, with an educational purpose. It will make you sad, it will squeeze your heart and maybe make you more sensitive about this subject, because it is a real story, it happened and this kind of racism still exists. Put yourself through this movie. After a while it will get through to you. Performances are great, great directing and picture. It deserves its rating.",8,0,0,29 October 2019
Joker," If Phoenix doesn't win an Oscar for this, We confirm that the whole industry is fake!
","This is the definition of the word STUNNING! Because that's what Phoenix was at this movie! It is a performance of a lifetime! I have no idea how he achieved this turn and brought this character to its highest but it cant get any better. We love all Jokers but here we have a different character, a different man, a man that we can finally understand, finally understand Joker's Why... This character was portrait-ed multidimensional by Phoenix! It was about time to expose today's society. This movie will shock you in a way, make you sad and at the end it will make you happy with the Batman connection and the comic and gaming scene! The whole movie was a masterpiece and can lead to many awesome sequels with Batman, Harley Quin etc... They just need to be careful. An Oscar performance with a small budget! Good job DC.",10,19,38,2 October 2019
Con Air," Wowow, that is a must movie. Thank you Nicolas Cage...
","Please just pay attention and love this masterpiece of action! This movie is a must for many generations! It has a ton of action, a thrill that drips down your back and holds you through the entire movie. It has a completed original plot with an amazing performance of Nicolas Cage who rocks through the entire movie in action, acting and everything! He even speaks with different accent, has a different look and WILL make you cry in the end! John Malkovich is also excellent in his master mind role! Great soundtracks! Just watch and enjoy. Thank you Nicolas Cage...",10,0,0,10 February 2019
Hancock," Short comedy to have fun for a day...
",Will smith was really different for this role which was a good thing and Jason Bateman was a great addition to the script but the story and the sequence of events were lacking some connection and explanations. Needed more comedy. had a lot of potential but not even close to it. Just an one time movie with your company.,5,0,1,21 January 2020
Arrival," Finally, a well made Alien Arrival movie with suspense and meaning.
","I didn't expect that, but this is a good enough entertaining movie with aliens. It has a good amount of suspense, good acting, a small plot twist and good looking Alien! Scenario and directing are very good but i expected something more from the great Forest Whitaker. Here you'll find reason, thinking, ways and many many things that you wonder about aliens. I totally recommend this movie. It worths your time but don't expect to see perfection..-",7,0,1,18 December 2017
The Terminal," True definition of the word ''Original''
","That was: An amazing script, a great performance and original plot with a fabulous directing! I wasn't sure about it but the movie kept getting better and better, with a lot of different features in it, that made it even cooler! Characters are great, the scenery was awesome, there was romance, passion, drama, pretty much everything! It is so original and so well made that you are probably gonna see it again and again! There were scenes that made you tense and participant to the whole story!",10,0,0,23 September 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," I dont care about it but its a good relaxing movie!
","I dont know whats so special about this movie that made people idolize it but i have to admit: Its well written, directed, acted with a nice relaxing music that surrounds this story. It is a good movie that you can see again and again but its not the ultimate inspiration for me and it didn't touch my soul. I give high rating though because of all the above i stated.",9,1,2,24 November 2019
Marriage Story," It felt that a lot of things weren't told...
",I have to admit Scarlet's and charlie's acting were really good and the script itself is realistic but i think it wasn't executed in a proper order. It felt that directing was lost into action and discussions were mixed up and a lot of things weren't told like they were supposed to in an issue like this one... I understand though that a lot of people might relate and love this.,5,2,8,12 December 2019
Step Up," Probably one of the most complete Music/Dancing movies!
","It might look simple but that its beauty. The 1st step up has the backstory of a bad boy turning into a dancer, something he is always meant to be, something he really loves. Channing Tatum really nailed it here, performance and skills! All this combined with some bro-hood, and romance and some dreams and some great hits (music), boom we got a success! Don't miss it!",8,0,0,16 June 2019
Creed II," This Nostalgia and those feelings...
","The 2nd Creed movie was great. It was a nice ending with some family drama and some powerful feelings for the past. It made them and most importantly it made us remember some great moments, some great lessons from the whole franchise. If you finish the puzzle right now, you'll see that this is a beautiful story, an inspiring one that you're gonna teach your kids! More specifically, the movie had great music, original training, great scenario and cast and an emotional Stallone that is impossible to ignore! Stallone can take one thing, one story and make the most out of it in an interesting way that is gonna get you pumped up! Thank you Rocky....",8,1,3,10 December 2018
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The truth about Batman & Superman
","This movie fans,ain't about who is the strongest superhero.It shows us that both heroes are extremely powerful and can win each other.Sure as you can see Superman can kill Batman extremely easily,but Batman is really smart and can bring the fight to his own ''stats'' .I think this is a brilliant and excellent movie from many sides.First of all it covered a great part of both heroes' stories.The battle was equal to each one and The fight with Doomsday is awesome.The 3 heroes worked great together which established the territory for the upcoming Justice League film.The effects and scenes were magnificent and the acting is perfect!The movie had its own 'things' and many comics things too.",9,9,17,24 March 2016
Jojo Rabbit," Original for sure..
","Jojo was really really original a war period and tried to deliver some comedy with some drama at the same time. We can characterize this movie as serious or funny , but I believe its a little bit of both. We should laugh when we see it and think when its over. Casting was good and the script adequate enough!",7,0,1,24 April 2020
The Matrix," The beginning of all! A movie that is almost perfect for its kind!
","Matrix is the movie that set up the base for every science fiction out there both for its script and its effects! Acting from Keanu and Morpheus amazing, direction perfect, music 10/10 plot unforgettable! Its a movie that everyone should give a shot. It is something we are all thinking about our world... I dont want to spoil anything because i will talk for 20 lines so enjoy!",10,1,1,17 August 2019
Green Book," I was looking for an awesome, meaningful relaxing movie... I found it!
","I didn't see that coming but this movie hits a nerve in such a simple way... A different way, a way through friendship. Its a portrait of new friendship, racism, adventure, beautiful places and the start of a new era. This duo has an amazing chemistry and their performance is really great. It deserves its recognition.",9,1,3,29 October 2019
Gladiator," Well written, well acted!
","Didn't expect it but you have to wait till the end. The movie is a great presentation of how things were running in ancient Rome and it manages to touch political, moral, family ethnic stuff... Russell Crowe was a perfect choice for the role and the soundtrack covered the story really nice. Joaquin Phoenix was a great bad guy in this movie, just as it should be for the son of Caesar. Not too much, not too less.. The ending exactly as it should be. Not an unforgettable movie but certainly from one of those historical and war movies that you see from year to year..",8,1,2,21 January 2020
Born on the Fourth of July," Why, Why did you end it like this??
","We have a hardcore, emotional, dramatic movie here that brings the best of us and a young Tom Cruise giving everything he had!!! The movie was presented simple and appealing , by creating a story for those ancient times and it climaxed with the duet Tom Cruise Willem Dafoe and their speeches. It is probably gonna make you cry. It might touch you and when everything goes the other way for our star, the movie ends while skipping one of the most important speeches that was absolutely necessary for this movie. It was where it was leading, what we and they needed to hear. I dont know why the production made a 2 25 minute film and couldn't give 5 minutes for a speech like that.",7,3,4,6 October 2019
The Social Network," Nice work motivational movie but it lacks something...
","Great acting from our duo co stars , nice presentation, motivation about skill,s work and maybe good directing too but something is missing like a soundtrack or a tale to say in the end or a climax for this greatness.... Had a lot of potential but it was lost in its own plot.",6,0,1,21 January 2020
V for Vendetta," You can't put a low rating with this hidden message and these performances....
","I was sceptical about this movie but man John Hurts performance, Natalie's Performance and those things V said.. stuck in my mind! The true meaning of the movie and the whole revolution is obvious and I appreciated it. At some point the movie keeps you tense and focused with its music and directing! Give it a shot when you re in a dark mood and you'll have fun!",8,7,9,21 June 2019
The Godfather," Honestly, I think the 1st one is just good!
","Im not a huge fan of mafia movies and especially the ones that last 3 hours and more. I will admit that for its time 1972, The first installment of Godfather is fine with a good performance from Corleones. Took me a while to recognise Al Pacino there ... I liked the light part with the wedding and then the exact opposite that will provoke whats coming next. Nice directing with some realistic mafia thinking. I believe though that the next two might be better. It would be better if it lasted 2 20 minutes.",6,0,4,14 October 2019
