Walk the Line," Formulaic biopic with excellent performances
","This is one of the most formulaic and predicable biopics that I've seen. Almost every scene looks like it was written to present a significant event in the characters lives. As such it successfully tells a story but sacrifices any real character development or depth. Each piece fits together so neatly that I was left asking 'What happened to the real people?'. Of course this is hard to avoid when you have to tell a person's life story in 2 hours. That's why the best biopics avoid this trap and instead focus on a particular episode or a small chunk of time (i.e. Pollock). Nevertheless, the performances by the 2 leads are outstanding. Reese Witherspoon was either born to play the role of June Carter or else she has been hiding a lot of talent under the one-dimensional roles she has mostly played in the past. Joaquin Phoenix is very good as the Man in Black- especially since Johnny Cash was such a unique presence. Overall, even with low expectations for this film, I found myself disappointed. Come on Hollywood, Johnny Cash deserves better than this!",6,1,3,23 October 2006
Into the Wild," Why wasn't this movie nominated for Best Picture?
","I just watched this film on DVD after having read the book about 6 years ago. I found it to be an excellent film adaptation of an original story.The acting is excellent. Emile Hirsch gives one of those 'career defining' performances. The rest of the cast was quite good. Hal Holbrook has a small but very touching part. What impressed me about the film overall is the excellent story telling. Sean Penn found a way to make the story compelling by using different voices to narrate the story. My major question is 'Why was this not nominated for Best Picture?'. I would say it is a better film than Michael Clayton or No Country. I wonder if it was hurt by the way it challenges contemporary social and cultural values? Of course one could just resort to saying that Chris was 'crazy' but that doesn't really address the fact that he tried to live a life based on complete integrity without compromise. An inspiring story, a heroic tale? A great film.",9,1,3,7 March 2008
