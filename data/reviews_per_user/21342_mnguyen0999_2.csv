The Mask," I don't normally watch Jim Carry, but when i do, i do it right.
","I love the Mask. The movie was just like a big cartoon, and fortunately enough, I am immature enough to love this childish humor. The effects were acceptable because it was meant to look like a cartoon. The jokes were funny if you have a little bit of a child at heart. I may be overrating this film, and i feel as i am, but its just the love of these nostalgia cartoons that makes me love this film. I cant say anything more, its just him Carry's best film to me, and deserves a little more recognition. This movie set out a cartoon series(which was not as good since the joke of putting a cartoon in real life is gone) and eventually a sequel, which i did not enjoy much either. The beauty was Jim Carrys over the top acting in this role. It does not work in many characters but is PERFECT for the chaotic mask. My opinion, I'm overrating it a bit, but go watch it.",6,1,2,2 March 2013
Pacific Rim," It wasn't great, a little stupid, but it was the most fun I've had with a movie in awhile
","There's not much else that I can say other than giant robots punching kaijus (Giant monsters). I've watched kaiju films since I was a kid, and really, all pacific rim is, is a special effects leap. A very large one. Though other than that, don't expect to actually take anything away from the plot, we're just here to watch giant things punch each other. However, none of the chars were un-like able to the point where they were annoying, and even though there was close to no development, it sort of felt like there was something to lose if some of the pilots died. My final point is the soundtrack, which just makes everything feel more massive, from the guitar to the sirens of the jaeger. Over all, not much plot or characters, but this movie, was probably one of the coolest things I've seen.",6,0,1,19 January 2015
