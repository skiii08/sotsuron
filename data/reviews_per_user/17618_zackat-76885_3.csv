First Man," Bit boring but good story!
",This is my opinion on the movie so if you like the movie don't get angry from what i say. This is my opinion so yeah. First man is a story about the people going to the moon. It has a really good story and got a Oscar award. But it was a bit boring. Most of the movie was just the people talking. When there was scenes when they go to the moon on a rocketship they weren't that exciting. I went to the cinemas to watch it and I just talked to my friends because it was boring. But it's good if you want to watch a movie about a true story. But to me I'm not that type of person. I like action movies and stuff as you see on the John wick reviews I did. But it still had a good story. It shows all the full details as Neil Armstrong prepares to go to the moon. It's a alright movie to watch. Older people would like it because they like true stories and stuff. But it's a alright movie and if your looking for a drama to watch I recommend first man.,6,2,4,23 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," Great! But a bit sad...
",OK THIS WILL HAVE SPOILERS IN IT SO IF YOU WANT KNOW SPOILERS DONT READ. Ok guys avengers endgame is a very good and exciting movie! It was very good to watch. But one problem I have is about the DEATHS of character. It's a bit upsetting to see iron man and black widow die... And captain America also turned old. So it was a bit anooying. Because a major character like IRON MAN died. I got quite a bit angry at that :/ But at least thanos died. But the movie is still really good. It's one of the most important marvel movies. And it gives a good story! It's good how they have to go back in to time to stop thanos get rid of 50% of the universe. It's a really good movie everyone should watch it.,8,1,3,21 June 2019
John Wick: Chapter 2," Pretty good!
",I'm a HUGE fan of the John wick franchise and I have to say this one is good. I think the first one is a bit better but this one is really good. One part the I kept watching over and over again was the concert shootout. The part was INSANE. Then he goes in the tunnel then that was when the real action happened. It was CRAZY with how much kills he got. He got like around 160 or 120 kill in this movie. CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT. I did a review on John wick 3 and gave it 10/10 because it was so good. You can read that if you want. And also the train station place part. That was really cool too. ESPECIALLY THE PENCIL KILLS. That's was CRAZY. Then there's the final one at the art gallery. This one was really good. That one didn't focus on the brutality more on the kill count. The first one probably has more shootouts and fights. But this one focuses on how much kills they get in the infrequent shootouts/fight scenes. The movie was really good and I recommend it to all action movie fans. You will be engaged to it start to end!,8,0,0,23 June 2019
