The Rock," Kick-ass and entertaining movie from Michael Bay. Even Hideo Kojima tried to emulate this into his 'Metal Gear Solid' games.
","Now I am not a big fan of the director Michael Bay, but this movie is kick-ass and is his best film. Sure, it still has the Michael Bay trademarks with chases and explosions, but it's integrated quite well into this movie. And actually has a cool plot, and stylistic emotions to go with it. It isn't the most intelligent plot but it does get the job done. Sure some parts might be a bit exaggerated, but for a action movie such as this, it works. It isn't a action movie that should be taken too seriously, it's suppose to be a kick- ass action flick. And like I said just about everything about this movie works. Especially when it comes to the entertainment department. From the action, to the passable dialogues and music it just melds together into a fun action ride. What really stood out about this movie while re-watching it, was how it was so obvious Hideo Kojima took notes and borrowed elements from this film. Especially when it comes to the style, action and characters. And how Hideo Kojima incorporated some of the ideas and tries to emulate it into the 'Metal Gear Solid' franchise. I remember when this film came out and how it was one of the biggest action movie of the 90's. As a matter of fact this film and 'Face/Off' is my favorite action movies from the 90's. When I saw this movie in the 90's I was just blown away by how cool it was. It is probably the movie that I could remember where I saw Sean Connery in action for the first time. And at that time, I thought he was the most badass old guy I have ever seen on screen. Even Nicolas Cage's freak-outs actually complimented this movie. Overall, this movie is a blast and I highly recommend it to just about anyone. Especially people that are fans of the 'Metal Gear Solid' franchise or people that are into action movies in general. Sure it has it's flaws when it comes to the narrative because of few plot-holes. But it's not all that distracting and sometimes it actually compliments this film somehow.10/10",10,1,1,2 August 2016
"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Not bad, but pretty forgetful British romantic comedy
","This is a okay British romantic comedy, but there is nothing special about it to the point I would recommend to friends or anyone else. Okay so the story revolves around a semi fat guy named Dennis Doyle(Simon Pegg) who ran away during his wedding day leaving his could have been wife behind although she is pregnant as well, cause he panics. Than after 5 years later she is with some other guy so in order to win her back, Dennis tries to finish the marathon that her boyfriend enters in order to win his love back. This movie really wasn't that funny for me, and just about every character in this was not believable to the point it really wasn't that engaging, which is a shame cause you can really tell Simon Pegg tried his best with what he had. Almost everything about this movie is predictable and not that entertaining to watch, it's not a bad British romantic comedy but it isn't that good either. But it's okay to rent it and it's watchable, and won't make you angry or irritated after finishing.5/10",5,0,1,21 April 2010
The Devil's Advocate," 'They must want you pretty bad''It's time to step up and take what's yours'.
","This movie is about a talented lawyer that knows exactly what to do to win cases. But his ambitions get the better of him and things start to get weird. This film isn't as impressive as I was expecting it to be, but it's still a pretty darn good movie. With everything interwoven in a really good manner. I never really thought of Keanu Reeves as a phenomenal actor but he is alright in this movie and fit decently. He played the manipulative lawyer and intelligent lawyer really well. Although Keanu Reeves takes up most of the screen time, the real scene stealer is Al Pacino. In fact Al Pacino is what makes this movie engaging, sort of. Even if Al Pacino first refused this role because he wanted to get paid more and the cool actor Keanu took some money out from his own account in order to get Al Pacino into this film. Now lawyers are known to some as liar and this is the premise of the movie with lies and greed. And this all adds up to evil and the consequences of this and the message is basically about how there is aspects of the devil in all of us. Well mostly temptation for most people. But we all have choices, in fact life is about choices and we are accountable for our decisions. Now I found this movie to be a bit mediocre but as the film comes close to the end, it really does pick up. Although that ain't saying much since majority of this is mediocre, but the as the film comes close to the end it really started to become intriguing. Now I can see why some people would think the final speech Al Pacino's character gives in the movie to be magnificent, but it's old and it's a philosophy that has been done before. But on the other hand there is charisma the way Al Pacino's character delivers it, and many bad men in the past had charisma. And the main reason I found why some people would root for Al Pacino's character is the aspect of his speech when he claims 'I'mï»¿ a fan of man---I'm a humanist'. Even if it's stupid for people to claim to have become a satanist because of the final speech scene. I will give credit the way it's delivered is done well. Again this film proves why Al Pacino is a extraordinary actor. Keanu is alright but Nic Cage would have been a better choice.7.3/10",7,1,2,19 February 2011
The Blair Witch Project," More irritating than scary
","Okay this movie wouldn't have been so bad if the three students weren't so annoying to the point I ended up disliking them so much. Although the movie isn't very good and it just seems to have gotten a cult following because they went in a realistic direction. Where it seems like the incident with the students and the Blair Witch really happened, but besides that there is nothing really good about this. I am sure the creators of this film is really happy to receive other people's hard earned money for a below mediocre movie such as this. Maybe they thought the incident really happened and was entertained by that one factor. And since the creators made this with a shoestring budget, and ended up getting back way more than they invested on it. I think my favorite part of the movie though is when all three students end up getting killed by the witch cause I hated everyone in this and leading some viewers to really overrate this, there just isn't anything that will make the audience feel threatened. And I ain't saying that cause the film hardly has any violence in it, most of this movie's run time is taken up with three idiots running around screaming over half the time. I give it some props for leading some viewers as if this is something real with it's marketing. I remember when this movie first came out, it was when I was in elementary and just about everyone was making a big deal out of it. Maybe because it's the first found footage movie that I know that came out.3.9/10",3,3,6,13 April 2010
The King's Speech," A stammering performance, in a positive way
","The trailer didn't really intrigue me, but this is a magnificent film that should not be judged by the trailers. In fact most trailers I got hyped up for disappointed me for 2010 but this one was a pleasant surprise. It isn't one of the best movie I seen for 2010 and isn't for everyone, since it lacks action and revolves around characters just talking to each other most of the time. But it's still a charming movie, despite it's main build up is trying to get a king to speak properly. This is a historical drama about King George VI having a difficult time speaking in public or giving a speech, because he has a very difficult time overcoming his stammering. Colin Firth puts on a stammering performance in this movie, and Geoffrey Rush did a excellent job as a supporting actor while playing the role of Lionel Logue. Who is the person that helps the king the best he can with the kings stammering. In order for the king's speech to be the strength of the people during difficult times. This movie didn't leave me speechless or anything like that, but it's a pretty good movie that is worth seeing at least once and the aspect of bonding and friendship is done pretty good as well. It just wasn't as riveting or moving as I thought it would be.7.5/10",7,0,1,7 May 2011
Despicable Me 2," Gru aka The Penguin is back
","I had a slight expectation for this movie and although it didn't meet my expectation. It's a decent movie that is somewhat entertaining for the most part but kinda dull and seems to drag in others. This time around Gru and his crew utilize more of what they have. And the minions this time actually makes more of a presence, which is a good thing. Except Gru is more of the good guy this time around, after the first movie. And this time it focuses in on more of the characters relationship aspect of things. Which is probably the best part about this movie besides the minions and maybe Agnes. It a alright watch but nothing really left and impression or all that memorable. And just didn't cross my mind as one of the best animated movie of the year kinda deal. There is quite a bit of 3D scenes but besides that, there really isn't much I can say about this movie. That I would recommend rushing out and seeing it in theater. It just lacked those clever moments or grabs you emotionally. Overall it's a alright family movie and that is about it.6.5/10",6,1,2,8 July 2013
Insidious: Chapter 2," Despite few clever part, it falls short
","So this is the sequel that basically concludes the story arc after what went down in the first movie. I guess the director put most of his scare efforts for the movie 'The Conjuring', because the scare factor isn't as strong this time around. Despite the super creepy violin score from the first 'Insidious' this one is even less scary than the first one. But what drives this movie is how the story integrates past and present stories together in a clever fashion, in order to make a somewhat interesting connection. Even the investigative work this time around is far more cool, than the first one. Although it does get more cheesy as the movie progresses. Although the mystery added to the creepiness in the first one. This one tries to answer a lot of the questions, the audiences might have had about the first one. And that is what this movie is, when it comes down to it. The revealing of the past secrets and more of why weird things are starting to happen after the conclusion of the first 'Insidious'. This movie did give me goosebumps, but it's riddled with jump scares. Overall, not much effort seemed to have went into this sequel, even when it comes to the production value which seemed quite cheap and fake. The ending is also something that is so generic when it comes to horror movies, that it comes off very bland. It's a alright horror movie, but nothing more.5.6/10",5,0,0,30 December 2013
The Lobster," A satirical film that is ridiculous and yet amusing
","I will start off by saying this is a surreal and ridiculous movie that is highly satirical. But that is what makes this movie work for the most part because even the actors seem to know exactly what direction this film is taking. Especially with there robotic acting and dialogue. Now when you hear robotic performance, most people will interpret that as negative. However because of the structure of this film, it actually compliments it. So the story is about a fictional and ridiculous setting where you either have to be in a married relationship with someone within a 45 days or be turned into a animal of their choosing. However you get extra days to get into a relationship depending on how many people you hunt down with a tranquilizer rifle that try to run away or rebel. This environment takes place within a very communist setting, where everyone has to dress and follow guidelines such as no masturbating and no listening to their own personal music. And the people that are against that group is a group of rebels that are against being in a relationship but allow masturbation and freedom to listen to whatever they want. And the person that the film focuses in on through these trials is a average guy that isn't very likable and yet he is very human. Except the fact that if he were to change into a animal he wants to become a lobster. And that is what I liked about this film. How there isn't really a hero but instinctual and psychological parts of human actions and thoughts. Although it's shown in a very satirical way with it's surreal, weird and ridiculous direction. This isn't a movie I would want to see again, but I appreciate it for what it is. If you are a audience member that likes art-house films or satirical films, you might enjoy this one. You will at least be amused.8/10",8,5,12,19 December 2015
Moneyball," Baseball business
","One reviewer I read claimed this movie goes in a approach similar to 'The Social Network'. This movie isn't really about a baseball team overcoming difficult odds while working as a team, but has to do with the sport outside of the field. The more business side of things where they trade and have conference to win in the game of baseball. And the plot basically revolves around Billy Beane played by Brad Pitt. Who is a general manager for a baseball team. Brad puts on a good performance as a charismatic manager you can't help but like. Although he seemed to try a bit too hard to come off as the cool manager that loves baseball. But his acting was spot on, just didn't stood out to me all that much nor was it all that memorable. Jonah Hill has been getting a lot of praise for his role and I thought he did a good job, nothing all that outstanding but alright. This is a well crafted film and very well directed, the thing is I really am not a fan of baseball so I didn't give a crap about the topic at hand. Maybe that was the case but this movie didn't really grab my attention or emotions, I could sit through it easily for the first watch but just didn't care what happened on screen. Some of the characters even seemed a bit off at times and not believable, like Beane's daughter for one who seemed to care about her dad's job security a bit too much at times. Anyways if your a big fan of baseball, there is a high chance it will grab your attention and actually want to see what is going on. Like the movie 'The Social Network' though this is more of a character driven movie that shows what Beane had to go through during the process of the plan that uses stats instead of the traditional way. Instead of delving deeper into the process itself, which was fine for me since I don't care about baseball. To sum it up this is a well crafted movie that the audience will enjoy if they actually care about the sport. It was kind of cool to see a guy trying to reinvent the sport. Although stubborn people that are against change because of the fear of being irrelevant and narrow mindedness tried to hold him down.7.5/10",7,2,4,29 September 2011
The Avengers," More like team arrogant
","The first time I saw this movie I thought it was a well crafted superhero movie. But when seeing it the second time you start to pick up on somethings and it just isn't that good. Now I am not downing this movie since it's not as entertaining as the first time seeing it. But you just notice some weaknesses. Now when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything all that original. A certain team needs to get their act together and not quarrel, bicker and fight amongst each other. In order to fight and win against a battle or a game when the odds are against them. Seem familiar? Because it has been done countless times. But the execution is the most important thing and the execution for the movie is well done and entertaining most of the way through. The final fight at the end is worth the price of admission. However when it comes to the plot there really isn't anything special that makes it stand out. The plot and editing in 'John Carter' in my opinion is more well done than this in my opinion. But unfortunately 'John Carter' didn't do so well at all when compared to this movie. Now Josh Whedon did a pretty good job when it comes to the Marvel characters portrayed in this movie and stuck pretty close to the comic book materials. But in the comics although the characters are arrogant there are other elements that turns it away from it being the main focus. For this movie arrogance is the main part of what the characters face and is one of the biggest obstacle in their path. What 'The Avengers' do is constantly have a penis measuring competition with each other when the world is at stake. Anyways the fighting and action sequences are really entertaining and cool to watch. Some scenes are like superhero smackdown battles so those scenes were entertaining as well, despite it all happening over arrogance and pride. So that is why I give this movie a 7.8/10.7.8/10",7,2,10,29 June 2012
Angels & Demons," Less controversional and enjoyable
",Although this book came out before 'The Da Vinci Code' I decide to see this after watching 'The Da Vinci Code' since this one came out second in this franchise with the adventures of Robert Langdon. While 'The Da Vinci Code' was a bit more entertaining this one is faster paced and goes more in the action/thriller direction. In fact this time the assassin isn't a masochistic psycho but some Jason Bourne like killer from Treadstone. This is a well crafted movie but just isn't as immersive or involving as 'The Da Vinci Code'. But it will keep most audiences thinking because of certain intuitions. And this one goes in a more realistic direction and has to do with the corrupt Vatican Church vs. the terrorist Illuminati. The ending is kinda cool with it's certain twist. But I wouldn't be shocked if Dan Brown got that idea from a certain graphic novel. But than again the last film in a certain trilogy probably got some ideas from this movies ending as well.8/10,8,0,2,12 February 2013
Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Good, but not a masterpiece
","I sort of liked the first Kill Bill better although this one is more about the plot and the dialogue which is Tarantino's trademark. It doesn't have much of the stylized violence from the first one, but this is still a very good follow up and very entertaining. Although there are points in the film it started to drag a bit, the dialogue is witty and interesting so those slow parts are actually forgivable. The interaction between the characters is also much better than the first. Although I am with the majority of people that enjoyed the first vol better than the second, this is still a good movie. But not really a masterpiece like some people claim it to be. Carradine that played Bill is the main highlight of this film.7.9/10",7,0,2,8 September 2010
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Super bland
","Wow, this movie was boring. The first two installment was a alright watch, but this one was boring from start to finish. The constant bickering of politics, setting traps and becoming a icon of hope. Was so generic and boring to sit through, mainly because of the lack of depth and originality. This third installment really didn't need to parts, but it seemed like they really wanted to milk this installment for all it's got. Despite it not having enough good materials to do so. It's like the movie dragged on as long as it can, despite the lack of ammunition to carry on. Just watch this movie to finish off this franchise, you probably won't miss much by skipping this one though.3/10",3,5,6,23 July 2015
Black Swan," One of those what the heck type of movie and yet it's remarkable
","This is one of those what the heck movies where you are amazed by it but don't know what the heck is going on until the movie ends. And even than some of the audience might still be confused. I never found ballet to be entertaining, but the gritty and realistic feel of the film makes the film most definitely worth checking out. Yeah it's a artsy film, but it's a psychological thriller that is also disturbing and sometimes horrifying. After watching this movie, I won't be able to think of ballet the same way again. I don't know if real ballet is this nerve racking and let me tell you the tension in this is very high, yet it's beautiful to watch sometimes. I was never a fan of Natalie Portman but she was practically perfect for this role and did her job really well. I enjoyed Aronofsky's film 'Pi' and I was immersed in this film as well. Sort of reminded me of 'Perfect Blue' except it's about a ballerina instead of a singer/actress and this is in real life. But that is a good thing. Vincent Cassel does what he does best, by playing the douche character.8.6/10",8,1,4,29 December 2010
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Not one of the great movies of 2011, but didn't regret watching.
","This series was suppose to end with the 3rd one but I am sort of glad the 4th one came out. Johnny Depp is once again playing Jack Sparrow and he is great and entertaining to watch as always. I don't see why critics bash the hell out of this movie, it really wasn't bad at all. Sure it has it's flaws and sort of feels incomplete. But it still is a thrilling ride and adventurous. My main complaint about this movie is how after it is finished it feels like there should have been more to it and seemed like it was missing some scenes. Also the coincidences in this movie is way to far-fetched to the point it sort of throws you off a bit and I am not talking about the supernatural stuff. But encounters, stuff happening at the right moment and etc. The movie seemed to drag a bit but it was still somewhat engaging. It isn't one of the great summer movies 2011 but I personally didn't regret seeing this. Personally I liked the sober Jack Sparrow compared to the weird and drunk version he played in the past. So I liked that change in his character, however I liked Barbossa(Geoffrey Rush) better as a pirate.7/10",7,0,2,27 June 2011
Men in Black 3," A lot better than I thought it would be
","This one unlike the second one that was just a crappy sequel with mindless plot. This one is actually clever with some good amount of alien entertainment. Now although the first 'Men in Black' is the most simple one from the three, I enjoyed that one the most when it came out because the idea was fresh. And maybe it's because I saw it in theater when I was a kid. But this one is close behind and is a good time that is action to action without any slow moments. The plot may seem simple at first with agent J having to go back in time to protect agent K and to save the world from destruction. But there is quite a bit of clever and entertaining bits throughout the journey. Now I wasn't overly hyped when I saw the trailer to this, but I am glad I finally saw it. Josh Brolin killed it as the young Agent K. I didn't have high expectations because of the second one in this franchise but the third time is the charm sometimes.7.6/10",7,2,5,22 August 2012
Frost_Nixon," 'I'm saying that when the President does it, that means it's *not* illegal'
","Well crafted film about a true story about a man seeking a big truth from the most powerful figure on the planet for it's time, the president of the United States over the Watergate scandal. Now I can tell why this film didn't do so well, although like I said, it's well crafted. Because some people are just not interested in American history and the truth isn't as fun or entertaining as fictional stuff. It's a involving film and everyone of the cast put on a good and some great performances, although I didn't particularly found Frank Langella to be playing Nixon, although his acting was pretty good. He did make it believable that the character he is playing is arrogant and loves his position of being in power and being in control and how his character would do and say almost anything to win. Michael Sheen is almost perfect with his performance playing David Frost. While starting off as a bit naive and friendly interviewer, turn into someone that starts using his wits and starts to play rough since his opponent who he is interviewing plays rough. This film shows power and money effects a lot of people, and how when a person holds a lot of power it leads to more greed and corruption. The only reason Richard Nixon decided to do the interview was because David Frost offers him $600,000 which is a big risk for Frost cause if the interview fails and isn't able to get the truth out of Nixon, his career will be in major jeopardy or even over. One of the most famous interview in history and all the work it had to get to certain points of that interview was interesting to watch. Now this isn't a film I would watch over and over again, but for the first time around it was actually quite intriguing. I especially like how it went in a direction where it's not about good against evil or anything along that line, but more about the fall of a man with feelings such as guilt that has went for the temptation instead of doing the right thing. Well done and compelling drama of a film, also somewhat entertaining. I also enjoyed Kevin Bacon's performance in this film playing the president's loyal lapdog.7.2/10",7,0,0,21 September 2010
Alien 3," Another disappointing sequel
","This movie by far is the worst movie from the 4 movies. The characters are not interesting what so ever, and the character that doesn't seem like cardboard gets killed off fairly early in the movie. I don't know why David Fincher decided to go this direction, cause it doesn't add anything by getting rid of a character that stands out the most from a group of convicted skin heads. It also disappoints the fans of 'Aliens' cause it shows everything that Ripley worked for adds up to nothing, by the beginning and the end of this movie. They tried to make Ripley seem like a Christ figure somewhat, but that all goes down the drain cause this time she is the one that starts the whole mess, and the convict that gets angry at her for that reason has every right to get angry. In the previous 2 movies Ripley was the hero and you root for her cause she is fighting some other idiot's mess, but this time she is the one that starts the whole thing and cause of what she went through in the previous movie, which might irritate some audiences. Also most of the characters are convicts and that being said, just about all of them are like cardboard and you just don't care if they die or survive. Most of the story is just about Ripley going around investigating what went wrong after the cryogenic sleep, which is pretty boring, but she also goes about stupid ways of doing it. I thought the atmosphere was pretty cool and gritty, but it all comes down to one by one getting snatched up and killed, the deaths are really quick too.4/10",4,0,1,2 October 2009
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," It's about the same amount of enjoyment as the first
","From the people I spoke with that saw this movie. Some liked this sequel better than the first one and others thought the first one was better. I am in between cause there was some aspects I liked about the first one more than this sequel but there are aspects to this one that I liked more than the first one. I enjoyed the constant duel between Sherlock Holmes and Moriarty where they are constantly trying to one up each other. It would have been far more interesting if it showed more of Moriarty's schemes and more about his characteristics. For Holmes's equal he didn't stand out all that much. But some of the best scenes are when Holmes's and Moriarty are on screen at the same time, even there conversations are fun because of the intellectual way they try to one up each other. Anyways Jared Harris who played Moriarty didn't stand out as much as I would have wanted him to be. As for Robert Downey Jr. he is good but sometimes he tries to make Holmes's a bit too kooky. I don't know if he is trying to copy Jack Sparrow but his character threw me off a bit at times and not in a good way either. So yeah I liked how the villain at least had more of a presence this time compared to the first one and felt more ominous. And I also liked the action sequences, they didn't seem all forced and was entertaining to watch because it was well choreographed and cool. Unfortunately the movie just seemed a bit messy at times and all over the place without it being fluid. If the movie flowed a bit better it would have been more engrossing, I can see how they wanted the movie to be fast paced but it just didn't work. As for the plot it's alright, but since it's a Sherlock Holmes movie it would have been better if it has more intellectual and well crafted detective work gone in. But the movie just seemed more convoluted than it should have been despite the simple story when it comes down to it. Overall it's about the same level of enjoyment as the first.7.8/10",7,0,1,14 January 2012
The Incredible Hulk," Edward Norton as Bruce Banner...Nuff said
","This is a Hulk movie I was looking forward and that is not only because I think Edward Norton is the perfect Bruce Banner and upset that he wasn't in 'The Avengers' and the sequel. The direction this time is fast-paced and entertaining. And the only disappointment I can think of is that it just wasn't all that satisfying when the credits started rolling. It seemed like the movie needed a bit more of Hulk or something. However there is a more standout villain this time with Tim Roth who is this tough as nails bad-ass soldier. Seriously, he tries to take on the Hulk and actually lasts a while. Sometimes superhero movies need a standout villain to keep the momentum going. However I preferred Sam Elliott as Commander Ross over William Hurt and Jennifer Connelly over Liv Tyler as Betty. But that doesn't effect this movie all that much in that it has Edward Norton as Bruce Banner. The CGI is much better this time and Hulk doesn't look like some sort of green clay monster. Hickson Gracie making a appearance was a nice touch as well. DÃ©bora Nascimento is hot, whoever she is, it would have been awesome if she played a bit more into the story. Overall this is a fast-paced entertaining Hulk movie that just about any fans can enjoy.8.4/10",8,0,0,16 June 2014
The Monuments Men," Not satisfying, but watchable
","Well this isn't a bad movie, but it is a disappointing movie of 2014. It just didn't have that impact or emotion to make it leave a mark. It tries to have those uplifting moments with the music and all, but because of the poor development and chemistry it just isn't able to reach that level. Sure this is based on a true story and the men that fought for culture and art did a commendable task. I thought they were trying to go for the 'Ocean's Eleven' with it's cheesy concept and all but it wasn't that which was kind of a relief. But there just isn't enough momentum to actually really care about the task and the characters at hand. Despite the fact that they are men trying to protects precious art works from Hitler's hands. This sort of reminded me of the movie 'The Untouchables', it has more substance than 'The Untouchables' but just lacked the flare as well. Just everything from the dialogues, to the characters to the direction is just bland. It's not awful, it is a watchable flick but nothing all that amazing. It was a nice idea to try to make a movie revolving around this story that is known by few people. Since movies about trying to take down Hitler has been done countless times in movies and video games. Sure, each characters does have time to shine a couple of times and George Clooney does make a good leader. I probably shouldn't be saying this, but it sort of reminded me of 'The Expendables'. Because it has all these characters that just doesn't have enough to develop and have a solid chemistry to care. Except 'The Expendables' is directed towards gratuitous violence and action, but that isn't the case for 'The Monuments Men'. Even the death scenes for few members on The Monuments Men team is sad, but for the wrong reasons. Not because of how it went down, but because there just wasn't anything for the audiences to feel emotional over. It's unfortunate, but this is sort of a waste of a actually very good premise.6/10",6,1,1,28 May 2014
Mission: Impossible III," Third time is the charm for this spy thriller franchise
","This franchise is slightly becoming similar to 007 franchise in a way where the sequels doesn't really relate with the previous movie in the same franchise. Which is a good thing in this case since M:I 2 wasn't a good movie, nor does the female protagonist Ethan fought tooth and nails for in the second movie make a appearance. To sum it up this is a brand new set up with Ethan Being involved with the IMF. But to some degree I guess it can be a sequel to the first movie though. Lets just think of M:I 2 as non-canon to the franchise, I personally think it's for the better. It seems the franchise is back to it's root of being a good spy thriller with a good mash up of action in it. The twist and turns isn't anything spectacular but it's still a entertaining action thrill ride that isn't just about the action either. Tom Cruise is plays Ethan Hunt as a cool agent while not being way too over the top with it. And Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a pretty darn good villain, I mean he isn't one of the best movie villains or anything like that. But he does really well with what he is given in this movie. The plot and everything else just goes in a direction where it's more entertaining than the previous 2 films. Now this movie is a great mix of spy thriller and action.8.3/10",Null,2,3,8 November 2011
Captain Phillips," Just didn't do it for me
","I will first start out stating the positive aspects about this film. It's very well directed, acted, while pushing and reaching the peak with the resources they had. It's also based on the true story about a heroic Captain of a cargo ship. So the intentions and crafts is spot on. But I just wasn't entertained or found this film to be enjoyable. There just isn't enough tension and thrills. It has a strong start, but really starts to drag after a while. I really don't want to say this, but I don't like pretentious movies. If the pretentious movie has the right or enough elements it can work. But this one just came off pretentious. I appreciate it trying to stick close to the truth. Although I have never done any research on what went down with Captain Phillips. Everything about this movie is predictable to the end. However my favorite aspect of this movie is how it portrays the pirates that invade the ships, as human beings. Although the end doesn't necessary justify the means. While some worry about the changing times, others worry about surviving. And I liked that message of this movie. Instead of portraying the pirates as these vicious and malicious villains. And when it comes to the pirates, they really sacrificed when it came to their diets. Since the actors playing the pirates looks like they just walked out of the holocaust. Their acting is also very believable. Despite the effort and the intentions of this flick, it just didn't do it for me. I can understand how some viewers would like or even enjoy this flick though.5.9/10",5,10,21,24 October 2013
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Watching it now, I can see why so many people bashed on this movie
","I remember first watching this movie when I was in elementary school. And was super hyped to see it when it came out, because just about everyone was hyped to see it. Especially the adults at that time. And when I got to see it in a jam packed theater, I thought it was entertaining enough. And I actually saw it twice in the theater. However watching it now, it isn't a super awful movie. But I enjoyed it as a kid, because it will appeal to mostly kids. With the cartoony direction, with hardly any depth or emotion to it. It had very choreographed lightsaber duels and stuff. And also included witless slapstick humor thrown in and even has one of the worst movie character, in movie history... 'Jar-Jar Binks'. I was blind to all the flaws of this movie when watching it as a kid. But seeing it now...Well it is a very corny movie. And I personally don't think George Lucas should work as a director. Sure, he came up with a imaginative space setting and characters with the 'A New Hope'. And I think he should have just stayed as the idea guy for the premise probably and not do the story and dialogue. Because I think 'A New Hope' ended up being a fluke. George Lucas seems to have focused on the CGI aspect of the movie more than the actual story. And the CGI for this movie is pretty awful in today's standards. And all the main CGI scenes, besides the pod racing scene was awful because of Jar-Jar Binks. I think South Park had an episode about this creature about how annoying it is. The whole movie was just corny and silly. I could talk about everything that is wrong with this movie, but it would take forever. I will just say everything about this movie seemed robotic and I don't mean that in a good way. That includes the acting as well. I did however like the backstory when it came to the relationship between Qui-Gon Jinn and Obi-Wan Kenobi. Although there isn't much development. And because it introduced Darth Maul, who is this badass villain that just doesn't get enough screen time. Oh and lastly I did like the theme song. I kinda feel bad for the kid that played Anakin because of what he had to go through after the few years later this movie was released.4.5/10",4,2,5,7 August 2015
Sucker Punch," Ultimate geek fantasy, but with some flaws
","I felt a like I sorta got sucker punched after watching this movie in theater. The trailer really hyped me up for this movie, it just had the elements I would really enjoy watching on the big screen. And to some degree it does, but the film has a lot of flaws. The video game/graphic novel style visuals and a bit of eye candy are the elements that is the main attraction for this flick. It seemed like Zack Snyder just thought up a bunch of cool sci-fi/fantasy ideas and tried to cram it in one movie, but without it being engaging or having a good connection. What I mean by good connection, is that reality and sci-fi/fantasy worlds does not connect together in a manner that makes sense. It almost makes no sense at all at times and just throws the audience off. The cast of girls in this is alright, but they are mainly there as eye candy but I ain't complaining. The CGI action sequences are well done and is very entertaining to watch. But when the characters enter back to reality everything gets dull, no matter how much emotion they try to pour out on screen. The plot just wasn't engaging or made me care for the characters all that much since there is hardly any development. And like I said some areas in the plot didn't make any sense because the connection between reality and sci-fi fantasy worlds is very thin. What it comes down to is hot girls kicking ass in geek fantasy worlds in a slick and stylish manner with some cool special effects. That is why I am giving this flick a 6.6, although it might be slightly unfair because the film overall isn't very well crafted. But the cool elements somewhat outweighs the negative in this, sort of.6.6/10",6,1,3,4 May 2011
The Perks of Being a Wallflower," One of the best high school/coming in terms movie I seen
","One of my favorite coming of age movie or a teen overcoming certain obstacles in his life while dealing with high school stuff. I think I like this movie more since I can actually relate with the protagonist of this movie. I sort of shunned this movie because I thought it was just a movie with Emma Watson trying to keep her career since the 'Harry Potter' franchise is over. But after giving it a watch to my surprise this movie is actually really good. Emma Watson plays Same a free-spirited girl. What I especially like about this film is how it doesn't try too hard, but has enough to be a great movie. Logan Lerman is good as Charlie the main protagonist that is going through struggles during his freshman year in high school. Basically dealing with the fact that he wants to be accepted instead of being ostracized. Which is completely understandable, especially how it plays out. Although Logan Lerman sort of seemed like he was copying Christian Bale a bit when it comes to his acting. The movie is basically about a boy named Charlie who has past scars dealing with high school issues and his love and affection for a certain someone. But the direction it goes brings out quite a bit of emotion without trying too hard. When it comes to actors and actresses the real show stealer is Ezra Miller, at a young age he is a really good actor and really gets into his role and is daring. He plays Patrick, Sam's stepbrother and he owns his role. I was impressed with his acting chops in 'We Need to Talk About Kevin'. Although I liked this movie a lot because it's relatable. It has other great elements to hold it's own. It's a great coming of age movie, although there is way more trials for Charlie to face since this movie covers only his freshman year. It even has some great quotes that stands out even if few are clichÃ©.8.4/10",8,1,2,12 March 2013
10 Cloverfield Lane," More than meets the eye
","When I saw the 2008 'Cloverfield' movie I thought it was a simple found footage monster movie. But after watching '10 Cloverfield Lane' and watching some videos about the movies on youtube. There is actually quite a bit of details that went into the movies that I missed. And that the Cloverfield universe is actually expansive and there is more to it than meets the eye. So the whole scenario is from the perspective of Michelle who is unaware of the the situation she is in. And what is the motives of the people she encounters in the bunker after waking up. However as an audience you will feel that you are drawn into this world and into the claustrophobic atmosphere where most of this movie takes place in. All the actors did fine, but John Goodman put on one heck of a performance as this unsettling, unstable and intimidating guy. He is like a ticking time bomb and you just don't know which buttons will lead him to go haywire. When it comes to the plot, it really did a good job of building everything up while keeping certain things a mystery. After the first hour the tensions really start to fly. I was on the edge of my seat trying to figure out exactly what was going on. This film I gotta say is the epitome of leaving so many loose ends and so many things not being explained. Kind of like the trailer for this movie. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film and have respect for it for what it accomplished with the resources it had. It's better than the 2008 Cloverfield movie although this sequel doesn't have all that much to do with the 2008 Cloverfield movie. The movie was renamed Cloverfield to make this film more marketable after all from the original script. Anyways, lastly I give the movie props for having a female lead that actually makes some smart moves instead of constantly falling down and making decisions that don't make any sense.8.5/10",8,2,4,17 June 2016
3:10 to Yuma," Western that almost anyone can enjoy
","This is a western that a lot of the younger generation can really sink their teeth into. It's a very well crafted western and I really enjoyed watching this from beginning to end. Now I haven't seen the original yet, but I can tell by just watching this that this is remake done right hands down. Christian Bale and Russell Crowe was perfect for these roles, especially Russell Crowe who plays the charismatic and yet complicated badass leader in crime. His performance was engrossing and very entertaining to watch. I found the trailer to be pretty good, but this is one of those movies that offers way more enjoyment than what is in the trailer. Yeah few aspects of the movie might not make sense, but it's not irritating at all. Ben Foster who plays Ben Wade's loyal but psychopathic sidekick did a performance that stood out a lot as well. The few final scenes was just awesome to watch, and if your a western fan most definitely check this film out. If your not a western fan, watch it anyways.8.2/10",8,0,1,29 December 2010
The Equalizer," It has Denzel, but still a forgettable film.
","So the main thing going for this movie is Denzel Washington. Yeah, I could say that about some of his other movies as well. But he is basically the only thing that really stands out in this generic film. Sure, it has some cool scenes with Denzel playing this badass. But it's nothing really knew in this type of genre. The plot is about a man with a past that is seeking redemption and retribution. He is a vigilante that puts the law into his own hands and handles things like 'The Punisher'. But probably not as cruel when it comes to handling the bad guys. Mainly because he at least gives some of them chances before he gets his hands dirty. I was able to sit through this, but it isn't something I would watch again. Mainly because it's just not that entertaining in my opinion and the character development is poorly constructed. And that includes the plot as well. It just didn't seem to flow that well. Marton Csokas was good as the villain Teddy, but his character was poorly written and his character didn't seem to bring out his full potential as the villain. Decent job sort of building him up and nothing. The only scene that actually stood out for me is when Denzel's character is sitting in front of the villain in the restaurant. And they exchange words with one another. Sort of reminded me of a scene from 'Heat'. Overall though it's a forgettable film.6.5/10",6,2,4,7 January 2015
The Expendables 2," Actually met my expectations unlike the first one
","While the first 'The Expendables' was a disappointing this one makes up for it. If you can vision a lot of the 80's and modern action movies stars that are badass on screen come together for one explosive action flick this is it for the most part. While the blood in this might be CGI a lot of it is real action and explosion with plenty of violence. The mercenaries are back and this time there is more at stake and more of a cause. Because one of their teammate gets killed and the mercenaries, especially Barney Ross is out for revenge for his fallen comrade. Plus the enemy has there hands on some weapons of mass destruction when the mercenaries lead by Barney Ross goes on a mission because of Mr. Church(Bruce Willis) because they owe him money. In fact Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger actually gets some hands on action this time and not just a small cameo. The first 'The Expendables' Jason Statham took most of the spotlight but this time a lot of the other members brings something to the table. It would have been better if it had more Jet Li in it, but he basically just makes a cameo with a small fraction of fight scenes which is in the beginning. It would have been awesome to see Jean-Claude Van Damme vs. Jet Li fight scene. Jean-Claude Van Damme is the main villain in this movie and man that guys knows how to play a bad guy that is entertaining to watch. And wish he had more fight scenes and screen presence. Randy Couture is the toughest guy in the bunch in real life but his fight sequences are brutal but their isn't enough of it, hope he gets more screen time with some brutal mixed martial arts. Terry Crews adds a bit more comedy this time around as Hale Ceasar. Chuch Norris is basically a homage to what he has become and it was good to see him in this movie owning his enemies without much effort. If your a action fan this is a movie you shouldn't miss. Even if the story is lacking it makes up for it with some explosive badass action with some mayhem and one liners that is corny but is entertaining to watch. If you know some of the action stars and the movies they were in you might enjoy this flick more since this is a throwback to the 80's action movies.7.8/10",7,2,5,22 August 2012
Source Code," One of the best Sci-fi flick of 2011
",This is a very well crafted sci-fi thriller that is fast paced to the point there isn't a single dull moment. In fact it wouldn't be a stretch to say this is ONE of the best movies of 2011. When I first saw the trailer to this I thought it would be a 'Deja Vu' rip off and although it's similar in few aspects this is a different movie. The twist and turn in this sci-fi flick is entertaining and also intriguing to watch the outcome of it all. Jake Gyllenhaal was great in this role and played his character in a way where you will care what happens and makes the plot more engrossing. I won't get into the plot much since this is one of those films where it's best to hardly know much about it before seeing. But what I can say is that it's a film very worth watching and should not be missed.8.4/10,8,0,1,26 April 2011
Skyfall," Didn't meet my expectations but is far from being a disappointment
",This is one of the movie I was really looking forward to seeing on 2012. In fact I saw it during opening night and it turned out to be a good movie. It shows more of the essence of the past Bond movies where Bond is less raw and more smooth in carrying out his tasks. Even the action sequences you can see more of the classic Bond movements and even gadgets that are not so far-fetched. I was hyped for this movie and although it didn't meet my expectations it was far from being a disappointment like 'Quantum of Solace'. This movie kinda shows the process of how Bond became the Bond he is with the build up and Same Mendes did a decent job with that. And Daniel Craig take this prominent role and again he is James Bond. Also Sam is known for making character driven and psychologically driven movies and that plays a part in this movie as well. Especially when it came to Javier Bardem's character Silva. Would have been better if the characters were a bit more fleshed out more since the movie is almost 2 and a half hours long. Some character are nice to look at but is hardly relevant to the story much at all. If this movie was a bit more tightly compacted with a bit more good action sequences it would have been a better film. The beginning chase scene is cool and entertaining to watch but after that the movie slows down a bit. After reading about the premise of this movie I was expecting a back and forth fight where James Bond and Silva duke it out and one up on each other. Because of their backgrounds. But unfortunately that didn't happen. In fact 006 played by Sean Bean made a better rival for Bond in 'GoldenEye'. Judi Dench is great as M as always and Ben Whishaw is believable as Q with his smart but calm way of talking. His character seemed like someone you could trust to have your back. 'Skyfall' is a good balance of classic Bond and the gritty narratives that make Daniel Craig Bond films really stand out.8.7/10,8,0,6,21 November 2012
The Hangover," Probably the biggest comedy of 2009
","This was the biggest comedy for 2009 and for the most part it deserves all the hype it got. It was ballsy and had some hysterical moments and kept me entertained and amused all the way through. This comedy was such a big hit that it even made few of the actors in this get more roles and stand out even more in other movies they will be featured in later. Especially Bradley Cooper and Zach Galifianakis, also even Ken Jeong. Zach Galifianakis on the other hand tries a bit too hard after this flick though, he was good in this movie though. To sum it up this movie is a instant classic comedy that will be remembered for a while even after you finish watching. This movie had just about all the right comedic element to the point it's most definitely worth seeing if you like comedies. Yes, some of the jokes might be a bit crude for some audiences. But aren't all comedies now a days trying to push the bar? I personally liked the shock factor in this, this movie is a 8.6/10 for me.8.6/10",8,1,3,5 July 2011
Iron Man 3," Very watchable 3rd installment...Just isn't a grand one
","There was quite a lot of hype going for this flick. Especially since it's a superhero movie and because it's the third or fourth installment for this superhero in movies. And despite the hype I thought this flick was alright but just isn't as epic or grand or even all that entertaining as I thought it would be. I mean it was a fun watch and didn't get bored of it like in 'Iron Man 2' but just isn't all that great either. The final battle in this where like over 40 Iron Man suits come together to fight the bad guys is cool and all. And thus worth the admission, but the build up is a bit disappointing. Not awful or anything but kinda disappointing. There wasn't much Iron Man in the previous 'Iron Man' movies but I think there is just enough of Iron Man in this one but barely passable. There is however a long gap showing Tony Stark investigating and trying to figure out a way to beat the villains without his suit. It's cool how they tried to make Tony use his intelligence which is his main weapon, instead of the Iron Man suit. Since Tony Stark despite his genius level intelligence has no powers. But just wasn't done in a way where it seems all that intelligent, clever or awesome. Very watchable but isn't impactful, despite him going all MacGyver on one part. And the main twist in this is alright during the watch but after it's finished and I started to think about it and then it started to irritate me a bit. The Mandarin is not only a iconic villain in the Marvel universe but it's Iron Man's archenemy. Like how The Joker is the archenemy to Batman. And both villains broadcasts themselves, except The Joker met the audiences expectations when Batman faced The Joker and it was freaking awesome. This one decides to give the audiences a middle finger after the trailer hyped up this villain. This movie completely screwed him over for a twist and in my opinion the sacrifice wasn't worth the twist. I don't know if they wanted to make this movie unique or was anxious for a twist. There would have been plenty of ways to throw a few curve balls at the audiences and not tick them off. Especially when a movie like this has a budget over 200 million. And would have made the final showdown more meaningful. Here is a idea, since the final battle in this flick has over 40 Iron Man suits battling. They could have made it so the Iron Man suits was used to use as offense or defense against The Mandarin's Ten Rings of Power, since each suit has their own special sets of skills. And it would absolutely would have been cool to watch. Few new characters also adds to this movie in a positive manner though...Mostly. It's a entertaining watch but just wasn't as entertained as I hoped to be and just didn't find it all that exciting. This is a very watchable third installment, just isn't a grand one despite the well crafted and yet somewhat lacking final battle.7.8/10",7,1,2,16 May 2013
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The first installment of the iconic explorer
","This was a very masterful, imaginative movie that will bring out the childlike hearts out of adults. The main protagonist Indiana Jones is played by Harrison Ford, I will just say that Ford is Indiana Jones. They first tried to cast Tom Selleck for this role but I am very glad that Harrison Ford played Indy instead. This is a film that inspired many filmmakers and video game creators by trying to recreate adventurous protagonists that goes on explorations. This film doesn't just have a iconic protagonist but many iconic scenes that is actually very memorable. Many kids tried to copy Indy and wanted to be Indy, because he is such a cool, charismatic, heroic and adventurous badass who is irresistible to women. He is more of a likable hero than James Bond and isn't a misogynist. Instead Indy is a true archaeologist at heart that loves history and does his best to preserve priceless artifacts for the future instead of personal gain. In another words, he is a role model that kids could look up to. So I couldn't help but root for the guy through his ordeals. The cinematography and set pieces is immersive and really does have the energy and pacing that will absorb audiences into the whole experience. It was even nominated for academy awards and actually won few of them. I will say again the set pieces really does elevate the action sequences. And the action is a blast to sit through and even adds the right amount of humor during certain parts. Films like this shows that the story doesn't have to be overly complex and has a lot of depth to it to make it classic. This is a solid entertainment blockbuster that excels in almost every area.10/10",10,0,0,7 January 2017
Resident Evil: Afterlife," Again stupid story and some okay action
","So Paul W.S. Anderson is back with another zombie techno action flick and that is basically all this movie is. No tension, no scares not even a decent plot, just a tough chick running around with guns and knives with other survivors killing zombies although there is very few zombies in this movie. With some stuff happening in 3D and the 3D in this isn't all that great. Paul W.S. Anderson made some bold statements about how this is going to be the action movie of the summer and how he is a fan of the video games this movie is based on. He is full of crap cause this movie is a alright action movie but has almost nothing to do with the video games. So the plot is Alice is back again and she is trying to survive while trying to bring down the Umbrella Corporation that is behind the zombie mayhem. Shawn Roberts did a pretty good job portraying Albert Wesker, at least he got the attitude and voice down right. Well to sum it up Paul W.S. Anderson took some parts from the RE games even the creatures and randomly put them in this movie although it doesn't make any sense what so ever, with techno music and slow motion thrown in. I give this movie a 5.6 for it's sort of fun action scenes.5.6/10",5,0,1,29 December 2010
United 93," Not a fitting tribute to the lives lost
","Well I have to be put in the situation the hostages were put in. But you just can't help yourself but put a palm to the face when the terrorist are outnumbered and there only weapon is a box cutter. The hostages should have at least tried to fight back but they don't, especially the stewardesses they act a little too over the top and doesn't really help the situation, even if the passengers as common people, not heroes. It almost seems like the creators were trying to only sell the movie on showing respect and honoring the hostages that died a tragic death, but the hostages just cry and doesn't really stand up for themselves. Even the scene with the crying cell phone call near the end. Interviews with the family members actually revealed that the passengers were calm. This is a tragic event in history, but that doesn't make it a great movie. This film just decided to go in a Hollywood direction without the budget, which can get irritating. It just wasn't a fitting tribute to the lives lost, plus you just don't care about the characters cause they aren't that developed or noteworthy. It's like the casualties on the news. Except in the film just exploited over the top emotions to get the audience to care. I give it 6 cause I feel bad for the victims somewhat not that I really care to be honest.6/10",6,1,4,22 October 2009
Casablanca," Classic film making, I guess somewhat of a masterpiece for it's time
","This is a beautiful and memorable movie and is a classic film for a reason. The plot is about a cold and selfish nightclub owner that meets his long lost love and thus slowly shows the reason behind why the way he is. There is a lot of other things going on, especially since it has Nazi official and refugees wanting to reach the United States all while taking place in Casablanca. This movie has very iconic scenes that will be portrayed in other films and TV shows, there will be a lot of parodies as well. Simply put this is a magical film and is the epitome of what a classic film-making is. Humphrey Bogart was just phenomenal playing the nightclub owner Rick, his voice is also iconic, especially for a film like this. I still think this movie might be slightly overrated since it's not as powerful or emotional as I thought it would be but for it's time I can see why some people would think this is a masterpiece.8.1/10",Null,0,1,6 October 2011
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," Not well developed but still entertaining
","Now when I first saw the poster for this movie, it got my attention. I mean Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter in a movie? As odd as the connection is, it was intriguing and was awaiting for this movie to come out. Now was it a amazing movie that has a lot of creativity going for it? Not really, but it's still a entertaining movie that gets better as it progresses. When this movie started after couple of minutes in I thought it was going to suck. But it gradually started to build it's momentum. Now the main flaw about this movie is the editing and how the story progresses. Now this movie is based on a novel so it probably can't fit everything in here. But the movie felt like it skipped around a lot of stuff. Like if this movie came out on Blu-ray or DVD it my have some extended parts but just wasn't put in the theatrical released version or something. The editing just felt all over the place all around and didn't seem coherent. Also I know I sometimes put emphasis on development of characters although some movies are fine without much development. But this movie revolves around the man the legend Abraham Lincoln, one of the most popular and notorious president. But for the most part especially Abraham's younger yrs, it didn't feel like it was Abraham Lincoln. Like the character didn't stand out as the soon to be legendary president. And seemed like it could have been anybody for a while. Which is a bit disappointing, even if it's fictional it would have been nice if there was more depth and development in a imaginative way. So he at least seem like Abraham Lincoln. But I guess that is just a small gripe, cause this movie isn't about Abraham Lincoln's biographic movie but it's him kicking vampire ass. And I gotta admit he is a badass in this movie. Besides the upcoming movie featuring Daniel Day-Lewis 'Lincoln' is the movie that tells the story in a realistic direction of the rise of a great president. I guess you can think of this movie kinda like 'Inglourious Basterds' except less self indulgent and with more focus on action instead of dialogue. And the vampire killing action is sweet in this and there is a lot of it. Even the way the movie ended, it left in a good note. Overall I enjoyed this movie and might see it again, not a great one but it's entertaining.7.5/10",7,2,5,10 August 2012
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," A cult classic that involves the human world and toon town but still no one would be ashamed of seeing it
","Some say this is a family movie but it's slightly bit dark to be a family movie. Since some parts maybe a bit too dark for some kids. Although if I saw this movie as a kid, I would have enjoyed every second of it, but it's a movie that leans slightly bit more for the adult audiences in my opinion. Because of the dark tone of it all, even if it involves cartoon characters. What this movie is, is a mix of the real world with noir style and the cartoon world going for it. Basically in this story real people and cartoons interact with each other and the cartoons job is basically the entertain the people which they seem to enjoy doing. When it comes to the plot it isn't anything great. But what really stands out about this movie is how the humans and cartoons interact with each other and the environment. The noir style and the acting is a bit childish but it fits most of the scenarios which also includes a place called toon town. Also Roger Rabbit can be annoying sometimes since most scenes takes place in the human world, but some of his morals saves him from being a entirely annoying and dislikable character. The grumpy detective starts out not likable as well but as the movie progresses that somewhat changes. The mix of human world and cartoon land is what made this movie work since it did a good job of it. It might seem slightly dated now but I would have been blown away if I saw it in 1988. Still a good movie, that lacks in the plot but makes up for it with other elements.6.8/10",Null,0,0,21 November 2011
Minority Report," A sci-fi movie that I would recommend to anyone
","This has got to be one of the greats when it comes to a sci-fi movie. From beginning to end it will grab the attention of the viewer until the very end. In fact when I first saw this movie in theater, I just had to go see it again in theater and I very rarely ever do that. Some reviewers nit pick this movie and try there best to find the smallest flaws. I just can't understand that cause this movie is amazing, with it's visuals and creativity. It seems like the some reviewers can be conceited and want to stand out by purposely bashing on a great movie. I know everyone has there own opinions but I don't see how anyone can really bash this movie, even if it might have slight flaws and may not be perfect. The sci-fi elements are just so very well crafted in this, in a way you can actually buy into what is going on in the future. Besides one technology, the rest of the sci-fi technology didn't seem all that far-fetched and there isn't a moment you can't help but roll your eyes at how ridiculous the future is portrayed in the movie. Now I ain't a big Tom Cruise fan but he was in some movies I really enjoyed watching. And this is one of them, Tom fit right in this role and his performance in this was great. He was right on spot with this role and it makes the audiences care what happens next. Also this film was probably a big break for the actor Colin Farrell, he was good in this as well. As sort of a rival character to Tom's character who is trying to track him down. Overall this is a sci-fi movie that is worth buying, I sometimes watch this movie sometimes although I already seen it a couple of times which is rare for me. It has depth and it's also clever and yet it isn't too convoluted. This is a very engaging movie that I highly recommend anyone to see.8.7/10",Null,0,1,7 November 2011
Training Day," Arrogance of power and corruption
","This has got to be one of my favorite street/hood movies I have seen. Although this is more from the point of views from a good cop and a crooked cops perspective of things. The narrative is easy to follow but there is street smart and street depth to it. Despite few parts not being all that believable, especially when it comes to some of the decisions and actions of some people in this. So yeah, the story connects really well together even the parts that just look like subplots. And when you throw in Denzel Washington putting on his most explosive, menacing, charismatic and powerful performance. You got yourself one heck of a awesome street/hood/crime movie that pushes towards what street justices is like. Ethan Hawke is even believable playing a naive rookie officer with a good heart. This is a entertaining and yet enthralling experience to sit through, especially because of Washington's performance in this.

","This is a sly, swift and stylish action movie that is actually a decent popcorn flick. Sure the plot isn't anything grand, but that isn't the core of this movie. A movie such as this needs a spark and how to go about it from there on. It isn't as adrenaline filled entertainment like 'The Raid' or has a super well blended and enticing story mixed with action like 'The Raid 2' but it'st still a pretty cool movie. And seeing Keanu Reeves kicking ass and taking names is just the bonus. Like I said the plot doesn't have anything that really stands out, but the stylish cinematography, choreography with enough cool action elements make this one worth at least one watch. Especially if you like action movies. However I could see why some audiences would not like this movie and why some people just wouldn't. You could really tell the directors got their ideas from past action movies, anime and video games. 'Max Payne 3' really came to mind while watching this.7.5/10",7,2,4,3 February 2015
Kung Fu Panda," 'There are no accidents'
","This is a CGI animated movie that kids and adults will enjoy. I remember seeing this movie a while back, but saw it again at someone's house and it's still a lot of fun to watch. We were all either laughing and grinning most of the way through. The action sequences are superb and there are a lot of them without being violent. I also enjoyed a lot of the message in this movie although it seemed like something you would find in a fortune cookie. There was almost no dull moment, the action sequences were a lot better than a lot of CGI movies that should have been more about the action. The visual were great and the story is very engaging and moving although it's a very simple and straightforward story that isn't all that original. But it still carries the movie very well to the point it's more than passable. A lot of the characters also stands out and they all have their redeeming qualities. Without giving away the whole story, this movie was more than what I expected, way more. Watch it with the whole family, I am sure everyone will have a entertaining and enjoyable time with this movie.8.5/10",8,1,1,2 May 2011
Gravity," A film that actually makes up for the lack of story and dialogue with something else
","This is a film that I can understand how some movie watchers might enjoy it and some others won't. This isn't a movie that has a lot of meat and dialogue when it comes to the story. Instead it's a tense film that takes place in space. With realistic physics, graphics, special effects and sound. Sure this are elements that critics bash on in films, but it does bring something new in a artistic way. Watching this film was like watching the movie 'Buried' except I like this one better. The entire film is about astronauts trying to survive by coming back to Earth from space when something goes horribly wrong. The acting was also really good, although short George Clooney just fit right into this role. Some may say this film lacks substance and to a degree it does, but that isn't the focus of this film. Sure some films that focus only on special effects alone falters however this has something new and different to offer. When you have your eyes glued to the screen and actually kinda care what happens and actually has your attention as an audience all the way through. It's doing something right.7.9/10",7,1,2,21 April 2014
Lone Survivor," It had potential to be a great war movie
","This is a simple special missions movie. Where four Seal teammates go on a mission to take down a terrorist leader that killed a bunch of Marine soldiers. It really isn't a movie that leads to the audiences to think about war or any of those stuff. It really isn't a intelligent war movie. But what it does have is good cinematography and topnotch sound effects and sound editing. Seriously the sound effects in this is one of the best I have ever heard so far. Even to the point it lead me to grimace just by the sound effects itself more than what I actually saw on screen. The action sequences are realistic and very well done. It also does a decent job of trying to put the audiences in the perspective of the Seal team. However the development isn't done so well and the four main characters that were on the mission just didn't stand out all that well. It just didn't really grip me nor did it gave me a rush to really focus and nor did it really have any emotional effects. I thought it was cool to actually know about the 'Pushtanwali' code which saved a soldiers life in this movie. So yeah, although it isn't really a stand out movie I still give it a 6.5/10 because it's based on a true story. And that does have a bit of an effect, at least on me while watching this movie.6.5/10",6,0,0,13 May 2014
Se7en," What's in the box!?
","This is very engaging and super atmospheric film that will grab your attention from beginning to end. It's a classic detective/crime/mystery/thriller that was movie everyone was going to Blockbuster to rent out when it first came out on video. It's also David Fincher's breakout film that really made him stand out as a director. The cinematography, the visuals and the eerie atmospheric environment plays a key role when showing the plot unfold. Mainly because the grisly and nasty environment that gives off the aroma of sweat and decay really plays a key part in the story. It's one of the key elements that makes this film stand out. Brad Pitt and Morgan Freeman makes a excellent duo that actually compliment each other, not really verbally but it works throughout this film. One is the brash and hot blooded detective with the mouth, David Mills (Brad Pitt) and the other is a wise and yet ignorant detective Somerset Played by Morgan Freeman. Brad Pitt was on his rising to super stardom stage and his role in this really helped him with the boost. The plot is about the duo detective going after and track down the serial killer that is on a pattern when it comes to the 7 deadly sins. This film is simply intriguing from start to finish, especially when this movie came out. Cause there wasn't a film like this before, as far as I know. And many films to come will copy or emulate certain elements from this film. Even video games like 'Silent Hill' was probably inspired by this film, especially when it comes to the environment. This is a raw film that is detailed and focused. Just about every scene has a point and has connections when it comes to the core of the story one way or another. The way it delves into the psychological aspects and perspectives is Watching this film is like watching a great detective graphic novel come to life on screen with superb execution. Add a stand out ending and you have yourself a detective film that is a masterpiece. 9/10",9,2,3,11 January 2016
The Big Lebowski," One of my favorite Coen brothers film
",This is one of my favorite Coen brothers film and thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish. It's a black comedy with humor that is clever and really works and will grab your amusement till it's over. And even when it's over I couldn't help but think about certain scenes in this movie because of the memorable characters. It's a brash comedy but all the elements work well together in this. Because of this film Jeff Bridges will forever be known as The Dude. The Dude is this really mellow and laid back guy who isn't that bright or ambitious of a person. In fact he is unemployed and lazy while drinking White Russian but I couldn't help but like the guy. Also how he deals with his surrounding and his 'what the heck' expressions is just priceless. He sort of reminded me of Homer Simpson from 'The Simpsons'. And adds a lot of humor to this film. The story is basically about a Dude that gets tangled up in a situation because of a certain coincidence and becomes sort of a kidnapping investigation and the people around him constantly makes the situation worse for the guy. This is a very humorous comedy with quite a bit of satire that works. And has bunch of scenarios that interconnect very well near the end. John Goodman is also in this film and The Dude's best friend...Well only friend. And he plays this obnoxious loose-cannon type of character and he will probably forever be known for his role in this as well. Overall if you like Coen brothers film or even a great humorous film make sure to check this one out. I wanted to get myself a White Russian drink after this film.9.5/10,9,1,3,29 April 2013
Unbreakable," Movie that revolves around comic books, but not really a straightforward superhero movie
","I remember first seeing the trailer to this movie while in theater to watch the first 'X-Men' movie. I thought it was interesting with the trailer showing a man surviving a train crash and being the only survivor. I was a kid when I first saw this movie and was a bit bored with it. I guess it's because I didn't feel it all that thrilling or nothing really superhero like stuff happens. But watching it now, this movie is innovative for it's time and sort of enthralling with the direction it tries to go. This was when M. Night Shyamalan was reaching his peak, with his unfortunate downfall later on. So to put it simply like what Quentin Tarantino the premise is sort of like 'what if Superman didn't know he was Superman?' well not literally but somewhat like it. No, this isn't really a superhero movie although it has a lot to do with comic books in it. This is more of a character driven movie with the interactions and a bit of psychological aspects in it. It's simply captivating and intriguing from beginning to end, like you get a grasp of what this movie is about few minutes in but you get more as it progresses. The themes of connection, opposite and weakness work really well in this movie. If your looking for a straightforward superhero movie you might be disappointed, but even than you will probably enjoy this movie for what it is. It's sort of a different take on a superhero movie. It's believable and realistic take on a movie with a man with powers since it doesn't give too much away and leaves some things to the audiences imagination. The mysterious aspect of this movie and the intuition and investigation part of it, is another part of this movie that works well. So basically just about everything works in this movie, it might not be one of the greatest movies I see and there could have been something that could have been added to make this movie better. But I guess not showing somethings you want to see can add to the mystery and thus I am giving this movie a 8.8/10",8,0,0,21 March 2012
Star Trek," 'Live long and prosper'
","This was actually a highly anticipated movie of 2009 and was a smash hit when it came out. It's a high level sci-fi entertainment that even the non-fans can enjoy. I hardly watched much 'Star Trek' TV shows so I knew little about this universe. Nor have I watched any of the other 'Star Trek' movies. But this one is the movie that got me slightly interested. Although I probably won't go and watch all the old episodes or anything like that. This movie is a cleverly crafted gem that has space battles, building rank and trust, rivalry, tactics and time travel with a bit of awkward romance thrown in. And it all works well together. Chris Pine is good as Kirk who is this brash, reckless and overly cocky but likable protagonist. But Zachary Quinto just nailed it as Spock. The rest of the cast is good as well. This is a classic sci-fi flick that will be remembered for quite some time and isn't a wonder why it caused a bit of nerdgasm. It will be difficult for the sequel to top this one.8.5/10",8,1,2,20 June 2013
Fury," So that's it?
","In my opinion this was a pretty disappointing movie. Sure, if you want to watch some tank battles this might be for you. But overall there isn't anything that makes this movie stand out. The story is weak and that applies to the character development as well. When it comes to the plot there just wasn't anything gripping when it comes to the action sequences or anything that leaves an impact. Now we all know the Nazis were the bad guys during WW2, but they are just ridiculously stupid in this movie. It's like the American soldiers have all these tactical guerilla warfare skills and the Nazis fight like soldiers during the civil war. This movie would have worked if it was a video game and it might have even won some awards, but as a movie it just isn't that good. And speaking of movies the enemy soldiers like I said fight like Call of Duty enemies in campaign mode one easy. On a positive note though, the acting is good but it's still wasted. Since the character development is so weak and the transition just doesn't make much sense. Chances are your not really going to care about any of the soldiers that manuevers the tank Fury. I recently saw 'Furious 7' and watching this movie was part 'Furious 7' where a group goes on explosive mission after mission. Except when it comes to 'Furious 7' it had other previous installments for character development. Part 'Inglorious Basterds' when it comes to the interaction except not as good. And part 'Miracle at St. Anna' because of the costant talk of spirituality. I think this movie would have worked if it tried to just be a balls to the wall action popcorn flick. But it tries to be something more and that is where it falters.6/10",6,1,4,10 April 2015
Fight Club," One of the most amazing movie based on a novel
","David Fincher did a phenomenal job of reinventing Chuck Palahniuk novel into a near perfect adaptation from novel to film. Edward Norton and Brat Pitt were perfect for there roles and I literally can't think of any other actors that would have been able to pull off the phenomenal performances these 2 great actors were able to do, Brad Pitt was nearly flawless. The unnamed narrator of this movie is a insomniac who is getting sick of his repetitious life style and is looking forward to escape and some seminars seemed to be the answers to his prayer. In till a women named Marla Singer intervenes in his way cause he knows and she knows that they are both faking there illnesses to come to the seminars and thus his insomnia starts up again. Soon the narrator meets up with a very unique and interesting character named Tyler Durden and starts up a fight club to release aggression, and thus the mayhem begins from there and goes about in a clever story. This film stands out from other films in several ways with it's numerous memorable quotes and satire. This is a guy film with it's gritty and violent but modern direction they go about it, which totally kicks a**. The plot twist is one of the greatest in movie history, and at face value it's a thick film, which is testosterone filled and anarchic. This film was crafted very well, and the editing was great. I highly recommend everyone to check this film out.9.5/10",9,1,4,10 October 2009
Citizen Kane," A man that had everything, but had nothing
","I got a chance to see this on the big screen at a theater close by, some of the audiences seemed bored by it. But this is one of the movies some people might have to ponder about after seeing it in order to know why it's a masterpiece. Before the death of Charles Foster Kane who is notorious and everyone wanted to be. He was filthy wealthy and had everything anyone could dream of. But their was more, way more behind the scenes from the public's eyes. And it gets revealed after Kane's death since reporters are trying to figure out Kane's last dying word which is Rosebud. Their is quit a bit of humanity to this movie, especially how it shows what makes Kane tick. There more to the world than money and it shows in this movie. How 'where would a man be without love?' and that is the main question of this movie. 'Citizen Kane' has dramatic approach to showing the messages but it's also very effective and the way it's shot in certain scenes is artistic. The camera work really shines in this and the plot is engrossing as it progresses. It's one of those movie that sticks with you and makes you think about it, even when it's over.8.8/10",8,1,2,29 September 2012
Monster," Charlize Theron carried the film
","This film is based on a true story although some of it may not be factual, it's about serial killer Aileen Wuornos was convicted and then executed 12 years ago in Florida. Wuornos was a prostitute who hitchhiked across central Florida to find customers. And society just shuts her down, making it difficult for her to succeed at anything cause she is deprived of the opportunities. The highlight of this movie is Charlize Theron cause she did a pretty good performance and she really sacrificed a lot for this role especially her figure by gaining a lot of extra pounds. The plot and direction of the film wasn't that great though, I just wish they had taken a more ambiguous approach cause this wasn't as dark as I thought it would be, but yes it was depressing in a good way. What I thought was good about the film though is that it's something a lot of girls and some guys can relate with, cause in the real world appearances mean everything, sad but true and people will accept you in the future for job and other tasks you may dream of doing just by your looks alone, so a lot of women out there with a butter face can relate with this film. I don't know how much of it was factual, but it wasn't gripping as I hoped it to be and forgetful. Oh and Christina Ricci was annoying as always, even if it's her character in this film and work well with it. Aileen played by Charlize Theron wasn't a character I could sympathize with even if some may disagree, her killing sprees just start to make you lose interest after a while although the scenario maybe a bit different. I give the film a 7.5 out of 10 cause it was based on a true story and that makes it more intriguing than it really is.7.5/10",7,0,1,17 October 2009
Memento," The first Christopher Nolan movie to stand out by the masses and for very good reasons
","This is the first movie by Christopher Nolan to stand out by the masses and for very good reasons. This film is simply a cult classic, wait scratch that. This movie is a classic period and it accomplishes so much although it's a low budget movie. Movies like this proves that you don't need a large budget in order to make a mesmerizing film that also challenges the audience. This is a film that goes in a reverse order sometimes and it has perfected this formula. And other films soon copied this formula but so far it just wasn't as good as this. People sometimes write stuff down so they won't forget and that element plays a big issue in this movie, cause the protagonist is a very forgetful person. His memory is very fragile and he can only remember very short amount of time. The premise of this movie is intriguing as it can get, which means just about any audience will be grabbed by the mystery of what is really going on. The dialogue is also interesting because of the premise of it all, actually not just that it keeps you thinking. And is another reason why you can't help but pay attention to what is going on although it can come off as ambiguous at times. Christopher Nolan is a good director that can even make a intricate movie like this understandable for the mass majority of audiences. Of course watching it a second time can rehash and make things more clear but it isn't as amazing. But I usually base a review from the first watch and from the first watch this is a amazing mystery movie. Where the puzzle pieces get put together bit by bit in the most interesting way possible. Like any good book or a movie the anticipation is the main drive of this movie and got me hooked from beginning to end. This is a clever film that anyone that enjoys movies should most definitely watch and not pass on.9/10",Null,0,0,29 September 2011
Inglourious Basterds," Despite the minor flaws, it's a film worth seeing. Especially because of Christoph Waltz.
","This is one of those movies that got way more credit than it deserves, and that isn't to say it's a bad movie. In fact it's far from it, this movie is actually pretty good but just not a masterpiece like some people are claiming it to be. This really is a self indulgent film for Quentin Tarantino, which can be for the better or worse. Now Quentin Tarantino is known for writing some of the most genius and brilliant dialogues, and the dialogue in this movie is very good just didn't seem all that amazing compared to his past movies. But it's still memorable and there is enough tension to it. This film is basically a war epic, not a historically accurate film which makes things a bit more satisfying especially because of the outcome. This film is not a action movie like the misleading trailers make it out to seem, but mostly revolves around the dialogue, in fact it's mostly about the dialogue. Brad Pitt is the most well known actor in this movie and his portrayal of Lt. Aldo Raine the wise cracking southern accent guy who is the leader of the Inglourious Basterds was done very well. It really was entertaining to watch his performance, but the main scene stealer has to be Christoph Waltz. He really did put on a phenomenal performance in playing the Nazi villain Col. Hans Landa aka The Jew Hunter. His character is smart, intimidating and evil to the point you can't help but be interested in this character. In fact all the scenes he is in, is like some of the best scenes in this. Now another positive aspect of this movie is that the main enemies in this is the Nazis and it's the enemies in movies and even video games where there deaths mean enjoyment for most audiences. On that note, watching the plan come together really is a lot of fun to watch even if the dialogues on the way to get there seem pointless at times and a bit to self indulgent. Diane Kruger was also a excellent choice for this movie, she played Bridget von Hammersmark flawlessly and she was really hot in this. In fact the cast of this whole movie is nearly perfect, I couldn't have thought of a even better cast. The music choice is nearly perfect as well and fit nicely with every scene it was in. The main negative aspect of this movie is the fact that besides Christoph Waltz being the best part about this movie, the most entertaining parts are with Inglourious Basterds but they are just hardly in the movie. The build up of some of the characters are done well, but it just didn't seem like the Quentin did enough with some of the characters that are in the movie. This film is basically sub-plots coming together for one goal and for the most part is done very well and it held my interest. Overall despite the minor flaws, but the set up is done so well to the point I give it a 8.3/10.8.3/10",8,0,4,10 February 2011
Underworld," Stylish action sequences with vampires and werewolves...But still wasn't that entertaining
","This movie had a cool premise and cool idea although it might have been done before this movie although not in the similar fashion. The thing is the movie just wasn't executed all that well. Although the plot is about a war between vampires and werewolves in modern time. It just wasn't exciting or as entertaining as it should be, despite the stylish action sequences. On the plus side it launched Kate Beckinsale career, I didn't even notice her in other movies until this one. She is perfect for this role as a vampire in tight leather wielding duel pistols. The movie is fast paced but the problem is, it just didn't seem fast paced despite all the vampire and werewolves action and cool cinematography. Maybe if it had more cool special moves like the part were the main protagonist Selene shoots through the ground to escape which I was sold for when I saw it in the trailer. The movie didn't lack in the action department just lacked in the 'that is freakin awesome' action aspect. Anyways didn't find this movie to be all that entertaining and despite everything that is suppose to be cool happening on screen it was boring. Oh and Bill Nighy does an excellent job of playing Viktor the head vampire, his presence was the best on screen for this movie.5.8/10",5,2,5,6 January 2012
Coraline," Dark and magical dream
","Coraline Jones is a girl who is bored with her life and wants to find some excitement. Her dream comes true when she finds a secret door in the new house she moved into. Which takes her into a alternative universe where everything is just the way she wants it, but all isn't what it seems. I haven't read the book by Neil Gaiman but from what I heard and read it follows is pretty closely. This is a film that kids and even adults can enjoy, it's atmosphere is a bit dark and kinda like watching a crazy dream come to life but you just can't help but be enveloped in this world. The whole premise was hauntingly pretty to look at and it's even choreographed really well. For me it was like watching a very dark version of 'Alice in Wonderland'. I am not a fan of Dakota Fanning, but she really does shine in this film and her voice acting is superb. 'Coraline' is a film for all ages to enjoy and have a good time with.8.3/10",8,0,2,20 October 2009
This Is the End," Well it's better than 'The Hangover 3'
","What I expected was a funny movie with celebrities acting like themselves, well exaggerated versions of the themselves. I got the second part but not the funny. True to the trailer though it goes in a comedic direction instead of the depressing direction like in 'Seeking a Friend for the End of the World' which was advertised as a comedy. But this one is basically the opposite of 'Melancholia'. Watching this movie was like watching grown up 'South Park' characters stuck in on house together during the end of the world. Which is a cool thought, except despite the obnoxious aspect of this movie it just isn't funny. If the obnoxious humor works it's cool but nothing about this movie is clever or witty, it's random but that is about it. Although few times the randomness works. I slightly laughed maybe twice during this whole movie. The jokes in this is crude as it gets but it's just not all that funny. It sets up to be funny and gets the anticipation going during certain scenarios but falls flat. It just constantly relies on dick and toilet jokes(literally) which can work once in a while. But over half this movie relies on those jokes and it really loses it's momentum. Few times I checked the time about half way through cause I lost interest in it all together and just stuck around to see how it ends. Few of the references of the actors previous stuff is amusing. And the actors playing over the top and exaggerated versions of themselves work for the most part but that is about it. If the humor worked a bit better I would have enjoyed this movie more but that just wasn't the case. Well it's better than 'The Hangover 3' but that isn't saying much.3.6/10",3,4,14,21 June 2013
Iron Man 2," Despite some flaws with the integration it's still a good superhero sequel that is worth seeing
","This sequel that has been overly hyped didn't meet it's expectations of how great it was going to be, but it's still a passable sequel. It tries to be intelligent but it felt like there was just a tad bit too much talking. Although I liked the debating scene in Washing D.C. And this movie just didn't flow cleverly like the first one did. It should have carried the tone of the first half of the movie although it wasn't all that great with the second half. Tony Stark still has the egotistical and wisecracking personality like the fist Iron Man movie but he comes off as an asshole in this. Tony Stark has been a bit of a asshole that tries to enhance or always tries to be on top even in the comic books. But his character in this just wasn't all that likable. In the first Iron Man movie Tony Stark had a decent blend of being a guy with a heart and being a bit of an asshole. I guess now his ego has skyrocketed way more after becoming Iron Man. The main villain Whiplash played by Mickey Rourke is a more developed villain than the previous one but lacked that interesting appeal that grabs the attention like what Jeff Bridges did. This also has more action going for it compared to the previous movie and it sweet to watch but it just lacked the soul compared to the first movie. Maybe cause the plot isn't integrated very well into the action sequences, it's done alright but not as well as the first one. The plot about the alter-ego leading the way for conflicts to start for a normal life in a Genius Billionaire Tony Stark daily lifestyle is done alright but nothing groundbreaking. Especially with great power comes a lot of responsibilities that he has to deal with. This isn't really a superhero movie that the kids will enjoy as much as the adults, simply because sometimes it has way too much talking going on. And some of the scenarios just doesn't make any sense, not because it's implausible but it just doesn't make any sense. This movie could have been a lot better if most of the scenarios and actions were integrated in very well. Overall this is a good sequel and isn't a dud but a film that is worthwhile seeing despite some flaws.7.5/10",7,0,1,3 December 2011
Two for the Money," mediocre gambling movie
","This movie is basically a gambling movie on football taken seriously. This is a okay film but also forgetful, even if it had some amusing moments which started from the beginning. But it starts to get a bit tedious and really starts to drag. I thought Al Pacino was the highlight of this movie, not that Matthew McConaughey but he just made the film more exciting than it really is. The characters in this film just doesn't stand out that much and you just don't really care for them, the outcome at the end was sort of intense but besides that it was a average film about gambling on football where people invest in there wisdom. There was just too many scenes in this film with Matthew McConaughey having his shirt off and working out which I thought was pointless, although some girls might enjoy those scenes even if it slowed down the movie even more. They tried to give to much sympathy to the characters as well, but it just doesn't really work cause it just show there greed throughout most of the movie. Al Pacino basically carried this film without him it would be below average on the emotions of gambling with some drama thrown in.7.1/10",7,0,0,16 October 2009
Alien: Resurrection," It's a fun movie
","I think people are a bit harsh on this movie cause of how good the first 2 movies were, but this movie is actually quite entertaining on it's own. Although it lacks the suspense and good action from the first 2 movies, this one has it's own style of entertainment, even if the movie did have some flaws. I found myself really enjoying it and wasn't dull or boring like 'Alien 3', it doesn't do any damage. Characters were interesting or at least stood out, it's simply a fun film on it's own but just can't come close to being good as the first 2, which is why I think a lot of people seem to bash the film for. I wished there was more alien action and firepower in this one, despite it's flaws this movie was simply fun to watch and adds new stuff to the genetic aspects that is simply fun to watch.7/10",7,2,4,3 October 2009
World War Z," Somewhat entertaining zombie flick with a big budget...Nothing more
","This one is a just okay zombie movie despite the huge budget that went into it. Which is a first for a genre like this. This went through a lot of re-shoots because they didn't like the direction it was going. And had like 9 writers on this project. The script just isn't all that great, it's basically those movies that goes from point A to point B to point C to point D in order to find a solution. Movies that go in this direction can work if it can get the audiences invested into the situation and characters but that just isn't the case for 'World War Z'. This is one of the movies that I had high expectations for the summer of 2013. It wasn't completely let down, it does have few entertaining moments. But for a movie of this scale and hype that has been going for it. It simply isn't a memorable flick and just comes down to being a good popcorn flick. It's a alright watch but nothing all that grand-scale when it comes to substance(although the visuals aren't anything all that grand either) and probably will not stick with the audiences and critics, they just won't really mention this as a movie that grafted into the movies you must watch for 2013. There just isn't anything particular that will engage the audiences to what is going on and what is going to happen next and how it will end. As a matter of fact the parts that are more engaging is the smaller scenes with Brad Pitt and his crew sneaking around the zombies near the end. Brad Pitt is just alright as well, as the hero who is trying to find a cure and save the world from the zombie plague. It's still worth a watch, but nothing special when it comes to the zombie genre.7.4/10",7,0,3,23 July 2013
Seven Years in Tibet," Has a bit of heart and worth a watch
","This movie is about a journey of a arrogant and selfish man named Heinrich Harrer(Brad Pitt) and after he is taken captive as a prisoner of war. And how he finds peace and compassion within himself. The beginning is fast paced and not developed enough, which is fine for a movie that has a long story to tell as this one. But it just wasn't engaging or got my interest, even if it's because it's to get Heinrich Harrer's character down. There is a long waiting period before Heinrich Harrer makes it to Tibet and than it's when the movie kick off and becomes heartfelt and touching. Brad Pitt was close to his prime when this movie came out and when it comes to appearance wise he has the charisma to carry the movie. His acting was decent but his Austrian accent just seemed way too forced in this. Sometimes I get used to actors or actresses fake accents but not this time around. The love triangle part of this movie bring out Heinrich's character but what makes this movie emotionally moving. Is Heinrich's relationship with Dalai Lama in Tibet. In fact this movie made me feel for the Tibetan people who are these really peaceful people that thinks of there 'enemy as there greatest teacher...Because only an enemy can help develop patience and compassion.' And especially felt for the Tibetan people when they started to get suppressed by the Chinese army. Although this movie doesn't entirely grab at the heartstrings it does have a bit of heart to it and is worth a watch. It isn't a great film but it's a good one.7.4/10",7,1,1,8 April 2013
The Hunger Games," Talk about a over-hyped movie
","This is a pretty bad movie, I just don't get the really positive reviews this movie has been getting. So this movie has been getting a lot of hype for a while and thus I was expecting a really immersible and engaging movie, this is just not it at all. I enjoy watch premises like this although it has been done before and in this case it has been done much better than this. The movies that comes to mind is 'Battle Royale' and 'The Running Man'. 'Battle Royale' has done a better job with this type of premise and made it engaging although it can be startling at times. And although it had way more students having to play the life or death game, most of them stood out to some degree. And it focused on all the different students while having very few main protagonist the story revolved around and it still worked. This time there is like 24 students playing the game and none of them stands out except maybe 2. The movie focuses on two characters in the game but after a while they just come off bland and boring after a while. I don't get why they would have 24 people playing if hardly any of them stand out at all. There is also obvious plot holes in this movie as well. So in this there is couple of Districts going from rich to poor, while the rich district look futuristic and very retro the poor districts looks like the people are living in the 1930's. With all the hype this has been getting I didn't expect a teenage romance movie but that element is a big part of this movie. I should have caught one when bunch of 12 yr old girls were at the bookstore looking for this book and being really into it. So there is 24 teens fighting for there lives but you don't care about any of them, there is almost no character development so if one dies there is no attachment. Jennifer Lawrence was pretty good as Katniss and Woody Harrelson stood out but that is about it. The theater was packed but a lot of the audiences was yawning and I heard one of them say 'this movie sucks'. The romantic parts are drastic and super corny to the point even the girls were giggling and laughing. And not because the movie was trying to be humorous but the some of the audiences was laughing at how corny the movie is. This movie just lacked excitement. What was really disappointing is the main event where the teens has to fight each other to live. But that was the most boring part of this movie, the beginning when the teens get selected and the training is more entertaining than when the actual game begins. So the build up for the main game is drawn out for a long time but the build up leads to disappointment cause it just isn't that entertaining. The cinematography is choppy just so they can show the violence off screen sometimes since this is a movie for wider audiences. I can sort of see the direction this was wanting to go but it just didn't get there. This might have worked better as a TV show with maybe 6 episodes for better development maybe. I haven't read any of the books in this series and this movie slightly made me want to read it. Since it's been getting a lot of hype and the movie just wasn't that good, thus the book might be better. And this might be a poor transition from book to movie. Elizabeth Banks is also in this and she plays Effie, I don't don't know how that character is in the novel but she was pretty good in this and when I first saw the movie I couldn't recognize her.5/10",5,9,12,29 March 2012
Zootopia," Pixar does it again! 'Zootopia' rocks!
","So I was in theaters and had the choice of watching this or 'Gods of Egypt'. It really wasn't a hard decision, mainly because I was getting tired of the overly CGI with live action spectacle. And because I thoroughly enjoy most Walt Disney Animation Studios movies since 2007. In this case, this film really beat my expectations. I really didn't know much about this movie besides the facts that it revolves around talking animals. Kind of like 'Madagascar', except this film is much better than 'Madagacar' or 'Ice Age' in my own opinion. This really does touch base with today's ideology and philosophy with the right tone. When it comes to the setting it takes place in a environment where all the animals try to live in harmony while living there lives like regular day to day human beings. Except they still have certain animal attributes and characteristics because they are still animals. And the main plot revolves around a bunny rabbit named Judy Hopps who always dreamed of becoming a cop and playing a part in making the world a better place. So she enters the police force and later teams up with a fox named Nick Wild. Who is actually a bit of a con artist and a hustler. The thing is Hopps is put down on the force for being a rabbit and people don't really trust Nick Wild because he is a fox. So that label just sticks with them and brings them down throughout the movie. I however really liked the chemistry of these two characters, it was cute and I enjoyed the banter between the two. Because of the clever quirky and snappy dialogue. It's like hearing the dialogue for '500 Days of Summer' except it's aimed for the whole family. So yeah, the interaction and chemistry between the two leads is actually better than some adult films out there because it's so well written. I really didn't expect this movie to be a buddy cop movie, which either is a hit or a miss and I will say this is a big hit. Anyways they are both put in a situation where they try to solve a kidnapping case that goes deeper and deeper as the story progresses. Like I said the chemistry between the main two leads is fantastic. One is a super idealist and the other is a skeptic, one has the heart and a good mindset while the other has the street smart but they are both clever in there own way. This film really resonated with me and the endearing moments actually got to me. I just didn't expect this film to be all that deep until I saw it. In fact I think this film will resonate more with adults than kids. Mainly because of certain jokes, references such as modern culture and mindset, certain messages and etc. Which will just blow right past most kid audiences. And I really liked the messages in this movie, it's something I put a lot of thought of in the past and something I could resonate with. It's something that I think everyone should apply in there lives instead of acting like a heard of sheeps. But whatever floats each others boat. However I do think this film will boost furry fandom to another level. I really can't see any flaws with this film except maybe the pacing is slightly slow at times, but I don't even think that should even be a gripe. It's just me probably being picky. The build up is good and I actually cared about the characters and the situations. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this film and I would highly recommend it. Some may say this movie is a bit too idealistic. But I just recently finished the 5th season of 'Game of Thrones' which basically deals with constant skepticism, assumptions, hubris ramblings and betrayal. That there is a motive for EVERYTHING! So this film was refreshing to me, mainly because it balances out the idealistic thoughts and rationality. That sometimes following your heart might not be enough to lead to the right destination. And that a balance of both is needed sometimes, which I agree with.10/10",10,5,15,5 March 2016
12 Monkeys," Dark, sad and intelligent time travel film
","This is a intriguing film with time travel in it although at first you may not understand what is going on, and is thought provoking cause of the time period Bruce Willis's character changes between. The story is basically Bruce Willi's character trying to save the world from a virus that will wipe out most of humanity while animals aren't effected by the virus, but the time travel and the laws behind it is quite realistic which makes it gripping. You also start to wonder throughout the movie if Bruce Willi's character is really going bonkers and just having crazy dreams or if he is legit and no one believes him. Bruce Willis was good in his role while not being his typical character like in a lot of his movies, cause in this one he is hopeless and weak while also being genuine. Brad Pitt also did a great job playing a psychotic character that is the leader of a group called '12 Monkeys'. The dialogue was also amusing with it's irony, with it's complex but compelling sci-fi story, that is also clever and engaging. It's also stylish with it's intelligent time travel concept as the protagonist tries to change the past to save the future. The ending was sort of predictable, but at least it wasn't too Hollywood, with it being sad and haunting.8.4/10",8,0,0,22 October 2009
The Impossible," Emotional disaster movie
","Not quite sure about the title. But you know the saying that when people face struggles and hardships together. They will build a greater bond. Well that is the epitome of what this movie is. This is a realistic disaster film that is based on a true story about the 2004 South-East Asian Tsunami. Which killed and devastated the lives of many families. The primary focus of this movie however is on one British family on vacation. Although some people seem to have a problem with this. I personally don't know what all the fuss is about to that level. There is plenty disaster movies that focus on just handful of characters. Plus if this movie focused in on a lot of characters, there just wouldn't be as much of a attachment. But yes, this movie just seem to focus way to much on one British family sometimes while not showing much space as whole. However it didn't really take away a lot from the experience. Sure this might be somewhat of a feel good movie. But it's also goes in a very realistic direction that brings out the conscience and will power of humanity. And how precious life really is. The realism when it comes to the effects and the people, is what really brings this film to life. Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor really did a great job of playing a couple that goes through pain and anguish. Even the kid actors put on a believable performance. Which is actually important for a film such as this. Usually on the news it shows the aftermath or far away discretion on what went down. This movie actually makes you feel for the victims more. Although I felt more sympathetic to the other more unfortunate victims. Because it shows visual imagery of what a lot of them went through. In a raw and brutal way, instead of sugarcoating it. It's a simple story that goes in a very emotional direction. This isn't really a inspiring or moving film in my opinion. But it does bring about a lot of emotions and is touching sometimes. Mainly because I felt that I might go in a similar direction and the connections between the loved ones seemed somewhat relatable.7/10",7,0,2,25 August 2013
42," One of the best biographical sports movie I have ever seen!
","This is one of the best biographical sports movie I have ever seen. And has just about all right elements and balance to make one of the greatest sports legend come alive. And after watching this movie I just wanted to research and know more about the guy. Jackie Robinson is portrayed in this movie as this charismatic, tough(physically and emotionally), talented and respectable person. Who had flare and knew how to stand up for himself in a rightful and courageous manner, with morals I could agree with. A person just about anyone can look up to as a role model. And it shows the obstacles and challenges he had to overcome and thus being a part of breaking the color line. And this movie is inspirational, it had my attention because of the heart and soul elements of it all. Which lead me to care and attach myself to some of these historical figures. The actor that played Jackie Robinson was great at bringing out the charisma/presence and the pain Jackie was going through because of prejudice issues during that time. But Harrison Ford was great as well as Branch Rickey, he played one of the top supporting actors with this role. I am kinda bummed out that I didn't first see this movie in theater. In my opinion it's better than 'Remember the Titans' which is another great movie that touches upon racism. By the end I wanted to applaud.8.4/10",8,1,2,19 July 2013
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Not a superior sequel, but still somewhat entertaining despite it being a bit longer than it should be with it's simple and narrow plot
","Johnny Depp is back as Jack Sparrow and he seemed to have a lot of fun playing this character as always. It's good to see the actors or actresses enjoying their roles, but that seemed to be mostly the main aspect of this movie. In fact watching this movie was like watching the characters running around a theme part and getting on crazy rides. But that just isn't really enough to engage the audience or make the story interesting or all that entertaining. In fact the main flaws of this movie is the plot, I know the creators are saving it for the 3rd movie but this one just lacked plot. It has one but it mostly revolves around Jack Sparrow and the other characters running around and acting all wacky in the jungle that seem a lot like some cool theme park. Some say the subplots in this are overlong and I sort of agree, but it wasn't really irritating to watch or anything and sort of had it's moments. This one has a bit more action compared to the first movie and I can see why it was a huge hit in box office. However the movie seemed a bit long with it's 2 and a half hour mark because of it's very simple and narrow plot.6.5/10",6,1,1,9 May 2011
Argo," 3rd time is still the charm for Affleck
",I am still not sure of Ben Affleck as a actor but the guy can certainly direct movies. And third time is still the charm for this actor/director. So Argo is basically a crazy true story about Americans working at a U.S. embassy getting taken hostage by in Iran. But six of them escape and is left of them escape and stay at a home of a Canadian ambassador. That is when the CIA come in to try and free the six hostages and bring them back home. The best bad idea comes in from Tony Mendez(Ben Affleck) to make a fake movie and act like a film crew to bring the hostages back home. While working under the supervision of Jack O'Donnell(Bryan Cranston). What I liked about this movie is how it didn't try to intentionally convolute the story while still showing it in a intelligent manner. Personally I think the movie as a whole could have been directed a bit better but Affleck still did a good job. Especially with the editing and witty dialogues. There is also quite a bit of tension in this movie and although you don't really know much about the six hostages I just couldn't help but root for the mission to get accomplished. Definitely looking forward to Affleck's next project.7.9/10,7,0,1,3 November 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Pirates FTW!
","For a movie based on a attraction ride, this is pretty good. But I still found it a bit overrated because of the big praise it got when it first came out. This movie is something kids and adults can enjoy, but it doesn't excel to something more than that. The trailer for this movie was more better than the movie itself, but for going in a direction where it's watchable for the whole family. It's done pretty well for the most part, although it comes off a bit silly at times because of it and not really in a positive way either. I personally didn't really like the humor in this although some of the audience might like it. Johnny Depp has created a iconic character because of this movie, and he liked this character a lot himself. Jack Sparrow is a fun and interesting character to watch on screen and is the character that stood out the most. The other cast members did really well with their roles especially Geoffrey Rush who plays Captain Barbossa. The movie was fun a ride, however it got pretty old after it got shown in school way too many times. Overall it's a good movie that the whole family can enjoy, but it's still a bit of a overrated movie.7.8/10",7,0,2,9 May 2011
Star Trek Into Darkness," Not as satisfying as the first one but still worth seeing on the big screen
","Because of the first one this became one of the most anticipated summer sequel. And for the most part it met my expectation, although a bit flawed. Usually the second installment is the one that really brings out what a movie like this is all about. Since the build up is done with the first installment, now it's about how the good guys utilize what they have to fight against the bad guys. Without much in the way of showing it. Since it's usually the third installment that tries to go grand-scale and sometimes even conclude the story. And a lot of times it has a stand out enemy for the good guys to battle, which this one most definitely has. However despite it having fan service and a lot of cool battles and tactics going for it. I just didn't find it as absorbing as the first one. It's however more focused on the bond between Kirk and Spock, with more strategic battle tactics and a arch-nemesis that is not only smarter intellectually but physically stronger. And is a very difficult opponent even with the whole starship fleet combined. Benedict Cumberbatch is just awesome as Khan who is a real formidable opponent for the whole starship fleet. Overall this is a entertaining and exciting summer sequel that is worth seeing on the big screen despite it having a story that isn't all that well interwoven and just isn't as satisfying as the first one.7.9/10",7,2,5,20 June 2013
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," Enthralling dramatic comedy that deals with love
","When I first saw the trailer to this movie I wasn't excited to see it or anything like that since romantic comedies seemed to be just heading towards just toilet humor a lot of times now a days. And just by seeing the trailer I could sort of tell what the story was about and it turns out I was wrong...And that is a good thing this time. Since the premise isn't entirely original but it's much better than the direction it could of went. A lot of the scenarios had a bit of the Asian drama vibe to it with everything that is going on, well a very condensed version of it and with more of a American flare to it. The main positive thing about this movie is that just about everything from the premise, the direction, the characters and the jokes...It just works for the most part. I couldn't help but be entertained by whats going to happen next, I mean it's sort of predictable but it's how it's delivered that makes this movie fun and enthralling to watch. The humor in this is actually witty, it's more of the serious but funny humor and doesn't rely on toilet humor. It has a bit of sex humor than and there but it wasn't annoying and for the most part it was sort of clever how it's delivered. Another thing that makes this movie work is the cast, almost all the cast fit right in with this movie and premise. Steve Carrell did the whole mixture of comedic/serious thing almost perfectly and Ryan Gosling played the ladies man really well, although sometimes it seemed like he was playing himself. All the rest of the cast put on a great performance and I guess it's because of the performance but the chemistry although short at times was believable for the most part. Overall this is a dramatic romantic comedy that just about anyone would enjoy. Unless your one of those annoying teens with a single digit IQ that just makes stupid noises, take random pictures and hide behind chairs constantly while other audiences are trying to watch a movie. Which happened when I was watching this movie, to sum it up this isn't a stupid comedy and isn't meant for stupid people that doesn't have the courtesy to just enjoy a movie while not bothering other people. Anyways it may not be the funniest comedy but the direction of it all is what makes this movie great.8.2/10",Null,0,1,30 October 2011
Green Room," Annoying characters and camera work, but it has a decent concept and setting
","It isn't a entirely something new when it comes to the slasher horror genre, but it is a watchable take on it. So the plot is about a amateur punk rock band group trying to get a gig. And they are desperate enough to even play in a neo nazi pub. However when the members witnesses a murder go down, things start to get really dark for the group. And thus a game of trying to survive by outwitting the people that are trying to kill them by hiding and playing fire with fire. Like I said there wasn't anything new to this genre. But what did stand out to me was how they try to fight against fear because one of the character remembers a past event. When it comes to the violence it is brutal, but doesn't come across as all that realistic. Not because of the blood and gore but because of how the characters try to handle themselves against violence. The acting ain't bad, but when it comes to violence it's like they were just asking to get picked off. I know they probably wasn't going for a overly serious direction despite the circumstance and situation but it does get annoying to watch sometimes. I did think the set up when it comes to the premise, like the title was sort of unique in a way. However the characters that are trying to survive just came off annoying and the build up of the characters was just poorly done. It would have been at least somewhat interesting if the punk band pulled some creative stuff as a group to fight back and escape. But since they were all so darn unlikable. I just didn't care when most of them got picked apart early on when the chaos started because of poor decision making. I also thought the pacing was poorly put together, especially when things start to get dark. There just wasn't any tension or suspense. So when someone gets killed off, you as the audience is just like *hmm*. Overall, I give this movie a 5 out of 10 because of the concept and the somewhat immersive visuals. Although the camera work got annoying during the violent scenes.5.5/10",5,2,7,24 July 2016
The Notebook," Beginning for Nicholas Sparks
","Sometimes I like to watch a romantic film by myself which is one of my guilty pleasure and 'The Notebook' is basically the epitome of a romance movie. I first saw it I thought it was okay but isn't anything that special, after a second viewing I can tell this is a heartfelt movie. Which maybe sort of brings homage to the movies back in the old days where young teens or couples go to watch a romantic movie. On the downside this film is formulaic and goes in a pretty narrow direction. Sometimes it feels like it's moving along too slowly and the development of the relationships seem a tad bit too quick, with some more development in some areas would have made the plot movie more in a fluid manner. The dialogue is a bit too cheesy at times and the story when it comes to the love aspect of it, isn't all that original...Even when this movie first came out. It's just the character direction could have been more explored, it seemed like the some scenes got cut out because of the length of the film. Even if Noah is a bit of a awkward name Ryan Gosling played this role really well and Rachel McAdams did a good enough job of acting like a girl during the time period the movie takes place. Although it's a mix of her true personality into it as well, although some part of the movie where she was playing a 17 yr old I found ridiculous. And there were few scenes that somewhat tugged on my heartstrings while watching it, although it was probably because of the music and the atmosphere of the scenes. The poor guy falling for a rich girl has been done before numerous times, this film has it's own charm to some degree. And like I said it isn't a clever romance movie and generic at times but it's a touching and heartfelt love story. If your somewhat like to watch romantic movies or movie for couple's, this movie is worth seeing. I also say the scene with one of Noah's quote 'Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants? Stop thinking about what I want, what he wants, what your parents want. What do YOU want? What do you WANT?' and other dialogues during that scene left a big impact. It was simply some very good dialogue in a romance film. Which is why I am giving this movie a higher score than I thought I would over a hour and thirty minutes into it. It's a simple love story but well done.7.8/10",7,0,2,24 February 2011
The Rocker," This movie rocks!
","The title of this movie is 'The Rocker' and it's PG-13, so I was hesitant in renting this. But I am very surprised at this comedy, what I thought would be something mediocre turned out to be something so much more. Now I can't say this is one of the funniest comedy I have seen, but it is very well crafted. This comedy was hugely entertaining and kept me smiling from beginning to end. Robert 'Fish' Fishman(Rainn Wilson) is kicked out of the glam rock band Vesuvius after the manage of the band offers them a great deal to make them famous, the only catch is they have to replace Fish the drummer with the president of the labels son. And Fish is very angry about this and holds a major grudge, but seriously who wouldn't and this takes place in 1986. But twenty years later he gets a second chance at stardom when his nephew Matt asks him to join his band A.D.D and be the drummer. And now Fish must use every wit he has about rock 'n' roll to reclaim his throne. I must say this is one of the few comedies where the jokes doesn't seem that random, and the rock star parodies were pretty damn funny. The part with the clichÃ©d rock stars was freaking hysterical and watching Fish partying like a typical rock star to catch up for lost time just adds to the comedy. I am so glad the creators didn't use Jack Black in this movie, cause Rainn Wilson is electric in this. Plus he contributes a lot to the new band he is in without being annoying a looking genuine, despite him being the oldest of the group and inspires the members and help them out with there struggles. The band has a awkward combination of members, but it works really well. Although I really disliked the lead singer and he even calls Fish a joke when he himself is a whinny emo douche. First of all that whinny emo douche has abandonment issues cause his dad left him, and Fish has a grudge against the band that left him to rot. And he turns his back on Fish who contributed the most for the band and got them to stardom, cause without him it just wouldn't have happened, even if YouTube played a bit part as well. He was more annoying than the band's manager. Emma Stone who plays one of the band members fit right in as well, while playing the girl that is always irritated by everything, she was still likable. The MILF(Christina Applegate) in this was actually attractive, cause they usually aren't no matter how many of the characters in films try to make them out to be hot, especially Stifler's mom. Let me tell you the songs in this movie is very corny but it's still somewhat catchy so it isn't unbearable and I didn't find myself hating the music. 'The Rocker' is actually a pretty clever comedy, just don't try to act more intelligent than the other audiences and just enjoy life, and if you have this mentality I am pretty sure your going to enjoy the heck out of this movie. I sure did. It's a enjoyable and entertaining comedy. 8/10",8,4,5,6 November 2009
Public Enemies," Good as a docu-drama about a notorious bank robber
","For a film this doesn't really have much soul to it or really pulls you into what is going on. But for a docu-drama this is done pretty well but has some flaws. I didn't really like the cinematography to this, I can see why Michael Mann went with this direction in order to seem more realistic and make the audience be part of what is going on. But I personally didn't find it effective and sort of looked cheap in some areas. So yeah didn't really like the camera work in this, it was like watching a expensive play instead of watching a movie. There also isn't much depth to this movie and doesn't really expand. However Johnny Depp did a fine job playing one of the most famous bank robbers in history. He really showed a lot of charisma in this movie and somewhat made his character likable because he played his character in a very charming and yet dangerous manner, also the way he carries himself. Christian Bale does a good job of playing Melvin Purvis, who is a FBI agent trying to track down Dillinger. Like Johnny Depp with Dillinger, Christian Bale really stood out in this as well but unfortunately the script didn't give his character a chance to give depth to his character. Even with the chase scenes and the shootouts, the movie felt mostly dry a lot of times. The love story in this is important to the story, but felt like it dragged the pacing of it all at times. This film would have been better if at least the characters had more depth to it, especially John Dillinger. He was just a cool and slick criminal and a bit of a hero to some degree and nothing was really menacing about his character. And didn't really feel like he was a bad guy at all sometimes because of the feel and direction the movie went with his character. 'The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford' did a better job with character development and direction even if it lacked action like this movie. This isn't one of the best movie of 2009 or anything like that, but it's still a watchable movie and is worth the time to check out.7.6/10",7,1,1,3 May 2011
The Babadook," Ambiguous horror movie that I do appreciate
","This is a horror movie that I can understand why some people would really hate it and why some people would praise it. Mainly because it's a movie that needs to be looked at in a in-depth manner in order to be appreciated. When I was first watching this movie I found it spooky, but it didn't really terrify me or anything like that. But it's a movie that can leave an impression after the watch. Because the psychological and psychedelic aspect of this movie really did start to scare me afterward. I was creeped out before I was able to go to bed, and I am at a age where I don't do that anymore. I also found certain criticisms towards this movie by other critics to be unfair. Such as some critics pointing out that the Babadook is too ambiguous and there is no origin story it. There is a reason why the director decided to go in that vague direction and it works. I also enjoy movies where you think you got certain characters figured out, but they make this 360 degree turn. Which can only work if the direction and the engraving of the characteristics of the characters in the story has been done right. Now the cinematography, acting and sound really brings this movie to life with it's creepiness and dreamlike sequences. Overall, if you are a audience member that want to watch a scary jump scare movie with your girl or a guy than this one might not be for you. However if you are an audience member that can have the patience to focus and delve into the symbolic and psychological aspects of this film. Then you will probably at least appreciate it.8.2/10",8,5,11,5 February 2015
The Other Boleyn Girl," A tale of two sisters, not as compelling as the trailer makes it seem
","I saw this movie on a plane to pass the time or else I would have probably passed on it. Nothing about this movie really stood out to me, in fact the trailer makes this movie seem better than it really is. It would have been somewhat entertaining if there was a cat fight in this metaphorically speaking. Like the two sister constantly clash with each other by trying to set a trap for one another or try to figure out ways to hurt each other in order to win King Henry VIII affection. But the story isn't like that, Natalie basically plays the bad sister and Scarlett plays the good sister. Natalie basically plays the sister that deceives in order to get what she wants and Scarlett's character basically gets forced to be with the King by her family's wish and Natalie's character wants to steal what she has. Natalie Portman is the actress that really drives that movie, she played her role really well. However I didn't find this movie all that gripping like some people claim or compelling like the trailer makes it out to be. Plus for a movie that has a lot of seduction and sex in it, there is no nudity. Now I don't judge a movie for it's nudity in most cases. But for a movie like this it would have been better if it had some and added more to the movie and made it engaging. Besides the performances and the production of this movie, I just found the story and direction to be bland.5.5/10",5,0,1,19 February 2011
Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time," Not a super terrible video game adaptation
","Like watching the video game for the most part and stays somewhat true to the video game, with the prince doing pakour and stuff. But despite that it really isn't a good movie, and I can see how some kids may enjoy this movie though. So yeah for kids it's worth checking out and some adults may somewhat like it as well or at least try to enjoy it. I just thought it was a boring movie, sure the film had a high budget and there are a lot of good special effects and stuff happening constantly but didn't grab my attention or compelling in anyway. Although some kids won't catch on but most adults will know who is trying to back stab who and so on, and just about everything is predictable. There is a lot of action happening in the trailer as well and I even found the trailer to be boring and the movie is even more boring. And if you see the trailer, you basically seen the whole movie. Sure it don't show all the action sequences since it's trailer, but nothing about it sticks with you. The movie is even called 'Prince of Persia' and you can't even see a single Persian in this or at least when it comes to the main characters. Jake Gyllenhaal did a pretty good job portraying the prince and his accent in this wasn't so bad. Fans of the video games might like this film, Ben Kingsley plays the bad guy in many movies and he is good as what he does. It isn't a terrible movie, but with the budget I wished it went to making a better movie.5.8/10",5,0,2,11 September 2010
Ted," I didn't like it but it does have it's target audience
","It's sort of awkward how I thought the crappy comedy of this year turned out pretty darn good '21 Jump Street'. And the movie that I actually had some expectations for like the one I am reviewing right now...Well didn't enjoy it as much. If you like Seth MacFarlane humor like the style in Family Guy there is a high chance you will enjoy this movie. If not, you probably won't all that much. For me I ain't a big Seth MacFarlane fan didn't find this movie all that humorous. The humor just seemed bland without anything special or all that original. It didn't even seem all that over the top like I was expecting it to go, cause if it was at least chaotic humor. Than it might have at least somewhat stood out, but there is nothing witty about the humor. Toilet humor is fine if it's funny but that just isn't the case for this flick. Somehow I think some viewers are just forcing themselves to like this movie cause they like Family Guy. But some viewers that enjoys Family Guy came out disappointed with this movie as well. I just laughed at one part in this movie, it was mad stupid but funny but that is about it. Everything about this flick was so darn shallow and sometimes don't make any sense in a negative way. You can basically sum up the whole movie just by the trailer except with few more jokes thrown in than and there. This movie does have it's audience cause there was a guy in his 60's that couldn't stop cracking up but it just isn't for me. Might have worked if the jokes were at least more inventive and more consistent. In one scene this flick actually has the nerve to insult 'Superman Returns'. Now I don't think that was a great movie and I don't care what the critics say for this matter but it's a much better movie than this one.3.8/10",3,3,9,5 July 2012
Oldboy," One of the best Korean movie I have ever seen
","I will start out by saying that Chan-wook Park is a film making genius, maybe Quentin Tarantino of Korea. The plot was original and the character development and cinematography was really well done. This is a revenge story that grips you from beginning to end, especially at the end. This movie is a must see, even if you have a weak stomach go watch it anyways, cause there will be those 'thats f***** up' moments, the fight scenes are few but realistic. I am not going to ruin anything about this movie or give away the pot, all I can say is just watch the damn movie. Korean film making at it's best.9.2/10",9,20,32,3 October 2009
Spider-Man 2," Probably my favorite Marvel movie. Everybody loves a hero!
","I was super engaged and blown away with this sequel, when I first saw it in theater. And for the most part this movie is so good with it's execution that it holds up even when it comes to today's standards. When it comes to the plot, it really delves into the mindset of Peter Parker and the sacrifices he is willing to make for the people of New York and his loved ones. And the struggles he is facing when it comes to financial issues and his selfless acts of pushing the things he wants away so others wouldn't get hurt. For a young adult it really shows why Spider-Man is such a awesome comic book superhero and I felt sympathy for the guy. So overall it's execution of balancing out Peter Parker's life as a nerd that is in love trying to get by and his superhero duties was done almost flawlessly. Because it really shows the price the hero is willing to pay for others. I also liked the portrayal of the villain more this time around, Doctor Octopus is one of my favorite villains when it comes to Spider-Man after all. I really liked how you can understand the villains point of view, you may not necessarily agree with his methods. But I could understand where he was coming from, because sometimes bad things come about from good intentions. The fight choreography is also much better this time around, the fight with Doc Ock is bigger and just more fun to watch. It's exactly how I would have wanted Spider-Man vs. Doctor Octopus fight to play out. And the train sequence about about 85% of the way through is not only heroic but uplifting and even enticing to sit through. There is even emotional scenes that actually works instead of it feeling like it's forced when it comes to the plot as a whole, which is quite a achievement when it comes to superhero movies. This is a life changing story when it comes to Peter Parker. And is can be a perspective changing movie for viewers when it comes to superhero movies because of how good it is. Like Aunt May says about a hero, a 'courageous self-sacrificing people setting examples for all of us' and that is exactly what this film shows.10/10",10,1,4,12 June 2016
Billy Elliot," Somewhat sensational but nothing really spectacular
","This wasn't a movie that was amazing as I thought it would be, but it's still a good movie. Just didn't reach the level where it really tugs on the heartstrings or moving in a really riveting manner. But it still brings about emotions and is somewhat sensational. The plot is basically about a boy dealing with family issues and other conflicts find passion and talent in ballet dancing and has some other elements as well. Maybe I was expecting a bit more or had a bit of a high expectation for this movie. Or maybe it's because the movie really goes in a slightly tedious and predictable direction. This movie can not be narrowed down to a feel good movie and can be sort of inspiring. Because it shows a boy going through struggles but can't give up his passion for dancing. Still it's a movie I felt was sort of difficult to get really immersed into and enthusiastic or even excited about. Still I seen some pretty bad movies lately and that is why I am probably giving this movie a 6.9/10.6.9/10",6,0,2,13 February 2012
The Fifth Element," It's like watching an awesome manga or Japanese anime action movie
","For what this movie is, I thought it was excellent. When this movie first came out I thought it was one of the coolest futuristic movie ever created. And I thought Bruce Willis was the coolest action hero ever at that time. This is also the first film where I saw Milla Jovovich kicking ass and she does a fine job of it. I also remember there was a lot of marketing that went into this movie. And I remember my elementary school teachers carrying around cups from fast food restaurants advertising this film. And for what it is, I personally think that it still holds up today. It's imaginative and I liked the design of it all as corny as some of it is. It's like watching some of the sci-fi arts from Deviantart coming to life. For a movie such as this some aspects of it seemed like it is ahead of it's time. This is the movie that Luc Besson really got to showcase his directing style and the elements that he likes to bring to the table. It's like watching a really good live action movie based on a Japanese manga or anime. Overall, this isn't a sci-fi movie that should be taken seriously but to just enjoy the fun, creative and stylish ride. It's not a movie that takes on a dark and serious tone like 'Blade Runner' after all. Instead it takes on a more witty and comedic approach with vibrant and stylish visuals but there is some meat to the story. Watching this again in 2017 was blast from the past.8.5/10",8,1,2,13 January 2017
127 Hours," Don't give up
","Who can make a movie about a guy who is trapped by a boulder a captivating movie? Well Danny Boyle can, this was a really engaging and captivating movie and most although most audiences will know the outcome. You still really care about the character and all the hardship he had to go through. James Franco did a phenomenal job playing Aron Ralston and made his character really likable. This film is shot so well that I actually felt like I was there with Aron Ralston, except I am just the audience so I can't do anything to help which made the experience more tense and painful to watch. Not because it's a bad movie, far from it but because of how realistic and captivating everything is. From the build up to almost everything else is done very well and will leave a impact when it's finished.8/10",8,1,10,8 February 2011
"I Love You, Man"," A romantic comedy with two straight guys
","This is a romantic comedy with two straight guys. And it constantly has those romantic comedy fights, the relationship fights. Peter Klaven(Paul Rudd)is engaged to Zooey Rice(Rashida Jones) but the problem is Peter Klaven is a big dork and since he is such a dork, he don't have any male friends or a male friend and he needs one for his best man. Peter seeks the advice of his younger, gay brother Robbie(Andy Samberg) and he tells Peter how it is, how when he gets married he is going to blow off everyone and wrap his life around the girl he is married to. Soon Peter meets Sydney Fife(Jason Segel) and forms a friendship. I found Sydney Fife to be a bit obnoxious but funny since he does and says stuff most people would back off from doing even if they sometimes want to, but Sydney actually does it. Most of the comedy in this is a cute comedy, but nothing really hysterical. It's a solid comedy but it just doesn't reach the level where you have to see it. This is a happy movie that is a good comedy to see as a group and even on a date.7.2/10",7,0,0,2 November 2009
Batman Returns," Tim Burton's style really shines in this version of Batman
","This sequel is more dark gritty and has more character development than the first one. The last one had some Tim Burton style going for it but this time it's really really distinct. Danny Elfman did a fine job of composing the Batman theme song and can easily get stuck with that tune in the audiences head. So when I think of Batman this theme song comes to mind since it just stands out. The previous movie shows the villain's origin and this one is no exception, except there are two this time. And it shows how certain character got to where they are. This movie might not tie in with the comics but Tim Burton's vision isn't too bad for this movie. Style and vibe of it is similar to the first one but it has a bit of dark Gothic feel to it. However some areas are just not developed enough to the point it can get sort of difficult to just go with it sometimes. When it comes to the penguins goons and some other stuff, it just seems a bit too far-fetched even for a Batman movie. It might work if it's a cartoon or goes in a really silly direction like the live action TV show. But that just isn't the case here. Also the characters actions and reactions are just not all that believable. Selina Kyle might not seem like a sophisticated cat burglar in this. And her origin might sorta suck in this. But she gives off this crazy and yet tenacious vibe. Michelle Pfieffer was a good choice for Catwoman, she isn't sophisticated like I said but she fits the role of a cat burglar for the most part and her voice is cute but acts crazy and rebellious when it comes to her action. She plays the role of a attractive and yet dangerous Catwoman really well. Well after she turns into Catwoman that is. Now the acting in this flick isn't necessarily good but the villains in this really get into there roles. Especially when it comes to Danny DeVito who played the Penguin in this, he was almost perfect for this role. Well at least for a Tim Burton version, despite him looking like a giant egg man sometimes. He may not be as intimidating as the Joker but he can be more comedical, intentional or not. Kinda felt bad for his character, but only slightly. Both villains are suppose to be a bit more sophisticated but these versions are passable although a bit too insane. Sometimes it feels like too much time is on the villains though than Batman. Which is probably one of the reason this sequel didn't do as well at box office. Cause youngsters go to superhero movies to watch the superhero. Commissioner Gordon is yet again wasted in this. When he plays crucial roles a lot in the comics. Lastly Christopher Walkens is always good and he plays a very very corrupt businessman There is few moments that make this movie stand out though, like the part where the Penguin and Catwoman taunts each other. This isn't necessarily a good vs. evil movie like the first one but has other elements crafted in, which might not be entirely a good thing but it works. This flick has it's flaws and not good as the first one although this has more character development. But it's still worth a watch, especially if you like Batman.6/10",6,0,1,9 July 2012
Finding Nemo," It's alright but just didn't seem all that special
","I remember the first time I saw this Pixar movie when it first came out when I was in elementary school. I thought it was alright back then but nothing special. And didn't have the impact on me during my childhood like the movie 'Lion King' or the first 'Toy Story' did. Didn't think it was a bad film back then but wasn't enthusiastic about it to the point I wanted to see it a second time. Now seeing it again as an adult in 3D my opinions about this movie is still about the same but I appreciate it a bit more. So the story is about a Clown fish that loses his only son and he goes across the ocean with a friend fish named Dory played by Ellen DeGeneres. Who did a amazing job with her role, in fact her character stood out the most in the whole movie. And through the journey it shows what Nemo is going through after being captured by the humans but mostly shows Nemo's dad's journey with clever fish scenarios thrown in different areas. And the clever scenarios mixed in with different fishes is what drives this movie. Overall it was a alright movie and you can tell quite a bit of effort has been thrown into this animated flick. But it didn't really have that impact to make it all that memorable.6.9/10",6,6,14,8 December 2012
Superbad," Not that amazing the second time
","When I first saw this movie in theaters I thought it was amazing, but it's one of those movies that loses a lot of it's impact the second time you watch it. Yeah a lot of comedies are like this, but I was literally bored the second time I tried to watch this. It wasn't even remotely funny or entertaining, but I guess for the first time seeing it. It was clever at times and Michael Cera does what he does best and as for Jonah Hill, lets just say he would make the perfect Eric Cartman if there is a real life version of 'South Park'. The whole plot is basically about 3 guys trying to make it to a party with alcohol so they can get laid. And McLovin was pretty hysterical in this and it's not a shock the McLovin trend started cause of this movie, well at least for a while.7.3/10",7,0,2,29 December 2010
Creed," Almost good as the first 'Rocky' if not at least to it's level
","This is a film that really beat my expectations, it really is a heartfelt film about the bond between the master and his student. This formula has been done before, but it's execution in this is what makes this one stand out from the rest. It's like the 'Karate Kid' for the 2010's. So when it comes to the plot, Rocky Balboa is now really old and feels that he is now washed up and just doesn't have any use anymore. All his main loved ones are gone and he has nothing really left to fight for. Something a lot of old retired people feel at that age. While also dealing with his own mortality and his longing for deep human connection. Than there comes Adonis 'Donnie' Johnson Creed or Creed Jr (Michael B. Jordan). Who after some thought takes under his wings. Now Creed Jr. has his own demons and insecurities he is dealing with. One of the main thing is the fact that he is a foster child and he also feels that he is living in his father's shadow. While people claim he is just riding on the fame of his father. Some fighters fight for money and to meet ends meet, some to put for their kids education and to put a roof over their heads. However for Creed Jr's case he has enough money because of inheritance, but still wants to fight and become the best at it. Because fighting is just in his blood. Michael B. Jordan who plays Creed Jr. in this was really good and is a likable and relatable character because of his flaws. Even though he reminded me of a similar character he played in 'Fruitvale Station' except he picked up boxing this time around. Now when it comes to Rocky Balboa he is not some Steven Seagal that tries to gain the world's attention by riding the wings of young and up and coming youngsters. He actually cares about his fighter more than himself. And wants to see Creed Jr succeed and to make a legacy for himself and to fight through his insecurities. Now that to me is a true hero, a hero to me is someone that doesn't try to drag others down because of their own insecurities. Or try to use and manipulate others for their own gain or their own comfort so they can feel better about themselves. A hero is someone that drives others to spread their wings and fly to bring out their full potential with love. Creed Jr's girlfriend who is this underground singer isn't just wise but she has the wits to know what is going on for the most part. She sort of reminded me of Vesper from 'Casino Royale' except more street. She is however isn't keen on giving people chances all that much, probably from being burned one to many times in the past. So in this she lacks empathy and trying to understand it from the other sides point of view, which is a big aspect when it comes to wisdom. But sometimes getting burnt can teach you and help you grow in the process, but it can also lead to not being able to trust people as easily. So it goes hand in hand. So I thought her character was actually really believable, not a fan of her music though. Sometimes the female lead role doesn't really play much into the core of the story, but her character is one of the core characters that opens up the inner thoughts, heart and drive of the male lead in this. The emotions and the drive to the human heart in this is impactful without it being pretentious or forced. I just thought this was going to be a cash in, a simple mentor/coach to a student kind of deal movie from the first teaser. And just thought they should have ended it with 'Rocky Balboa'. It's a good thing I was wrong. The bond between the Rocky and Creed Jr. really has heart and a deep connection going for it and not just through boxing either, although that is the main part of it. No one wants to watch a hero deteriorate, but it also shows the natural of life. That the people you look up to on earth will not be here someday. It's kind of like watching Batman getting Robin to take his place when he is done, but Batman or Bruce Wayne is irreplaceable. Still a 'Robin' movie can be really good if done right and that is the case with 'Creed'. It's a film that is executed superbly. Even the training montage pumped me up, it was exhilarating and emotional because of the distance and direction of Creed Jr. and what he is fighting for while seeing eye to eye with Rocky Balboa (No he does not hit hanging pieces of meat in this). This is a great boxing movie that beats the crap out of 'Southpaw' and I am super glad it wasn't another 'Rocky 5. I personally think it's not as good as 'Million Dollar Baby' but it's still a exceptional film. There is two main boxing scenes in this, minus the amateur boxing and sparring. And it's still engaging from start to finish and that is a accomplishment. There is one single take boxing sequence that probably took a lot of planning, practice and many retakes to do.*Interesting fact* they actually used real topnotch boxers to play some big roles in this.8.8/10",8,1,4,7 January 2016
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," Just play the video game based off this movie instead
","Besides the cast this one is a miss when it comes to superhero movies or anti-hero movies. The trailer made it seem like this movie just wasn't going to be good and it's a movie that just has no heart or substance to it. The only thing that stands out about this movie is the casting. Which is composed of Hugh Jackman who is probably only the perfect one to ever play Wolverine. Liev Schreiber is alright as sabretooth, Lieve basically plays sabretooth in a sophisticated and yet savage and sinister way if there is such a thing or person. And Ryan Reynolds is pretty good as the merc with the mouth Deadpool or in this for the most part Wade Wilson. And Taylor Kitsch is decent as Gambit but maybe just because of the appearance wise. But besides the casting this is just a forgettable popcorn flick that doesn't connect well with the comics or the previous X-Men movies. Just do yourself a favor and just play the video game that is based off this movie, it surpasses this movie in just every way including the story. If a video game currently can surpass the movie it's based off of in every way it really shows how bad this movie is. So yeah, just play X-Men Origins: Wolverine the video game instead and enjoy.4.8/10",4,1,3,1 April 2013
Rise of the Guardians," Just about has all the right ingredients...Almost
","Now this isn't a great CGI animated movie but it's a entertaining one that the whole family can enjoy. Except maybe the people that gets really offended by others believing in myth and holiday character. What this is, is basically a superhero movie for kids with myth and holiday characters. Such as Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy, the Sandman and the new recruit Jack Frost. I won't get too detailed with the plot but it seemed like the makers put quite a bit of thought into it. Although there is a bit of plot-holes than and there. So Jack Frost is the new recruit that is all about fun and games and he is asked to join the Guardians a group of myth and holiday characters that watch over and protect the children. So it's basically about a guy that thinks he can't do anything put up against a big task. Basically to stop the Boogieman from harming the children. This similar premise has been done before a lot and it goes in a pretty predictable direction. But it does try to bring out some emotions and it works alright. But the thing is this movie just doesn't leave an impact or has that flare to really make it stand out. The 3D was sorta fun and it is used quite a bit in this but I personally wasn't super immersed into the movie. The action sequences is cool and it did seem like it had the right formula but it just seemed to have missed some special ingredients. It just about had all the elements to be a great movie but it missed out by some margin. It felt like watching a cool Saturday morning cartoon except with amazing animation. Overall it's still a entertaining family movie that adults and kids can enjoy.7.4/10",7,4,6,29 November 2012
Troy," Still a epic movie
","Yeah, this one is a epic movie that goes in a narrow direction without much substance. But it's still a epic movie and does have some substance going for it. It's a entertaining epic movie where these mythological stories are shown in a way like it could have really happened that way kinda deal. It does mention mythological gods a lot in this movie but that isn't the primary focus of this movie. In fact the people are portrayed as fools that lack common sense when they believe and worship the mythological gods in this one. And shows how even the most men with honor can fall. The battles are entertaining, including the duels. Which are cool and thrilling at the the same time. Especially one of the duel, since I actually cared about the characters. One is Achilles(Brad Pitt) who is is charismatic, brave, egotistical, cocky warrior that has a talent for killing people and has a ambitious goal of having his name written in history or become legend. In another words he is the type that a lot of girls would fall for. While Hector(Eric Bana) who is a prince of troy and also a courageous warrior that fights for the people of his land. And has a strong sense of code and honor even in battle. And shows respect even towards his enemies. So it may seem like it's obvious who's side to root for especially since on king is better than the other. But the direction it goes makes you actually care about Achilles since he is a man that a lot of guys can relate with in some ways. Plus he is the main marketing tool when they tried to promote this movie, with Brad Pitt flexing his muscle and almost naked in few scenes. But I thought he stood out as Achilles because of his charisma. Well as long as it sells tickets I guess. I personally thought this movie has enough substance and entertainment value to make it worth seeing. The characters was very well integrated into this movie and actually has a presence. This is a enjoyable movie that has a lot of the right elements although it's kinda rushed and weak in some areas.7.9/10",7,0,0,20 July 2013
Just Go with It," I couldn't just go with it
","This movie turned out to be way lower than my expectation and I had a very low expectation for this movie. It was just so darn dull, lame and downright predictable. If you seen the trailer, you can basically summarize EXACTLY what this movie is about and the direction it's going to take and how it's going to end. I liked Adam Sandler movies in the past, mainly during my childhood. But it seems he isn't even trying anymore at all. He plays basically the same character in every movie, it also seems he is trying a bit too hard to make himself likable and cool for the majority of the audiences. Which is fine, but he plays the similar smart ass that sometimes makes witty remarks that bash on idiots while he also has a bit of anger issues and he is always good with kids. That is basically the same formula he goes with in this movie as well, it's like he didn't even clearly read the script and just did it for the paycheck. This movie also seemed way longer than it's running time, I was actually constantly checking the time to make sure when it will end cause the running time felt like it was going so darn slow. The jokes are just plain lame in this movie and I didn't even get a single chuckle out of this movie and most definitely didn't laugh at all. I just can't see how anyone would really enjoy this movie. There is way better comedies out there, some even that features Adam Sandler in the past. Just go see that instead of wasting time with this crap.2.8/10",Null,4,9,15 July 2011
Chicken Run," I appreciate this film more now than before
","I remember when this movie first came out, I had the choice of seeing this or 'Gladiator' but my friend kept saying he wanted to see 'Chicken Run' so we ended up watching this. It's not as good as 'Gladiator' but it's still a very watchable movie. What I really liked about this movie is the creative ways the hens tries to escape from the egg farm and the interactions between the characters. It really brings out the classic chemistry and dialogues that actually made me sort of care about the cause. Maybe because it subtly makes references to other classic movies. The message might come off as subtle to some, but I liked the message of breaking through the barrier and the comfort zone for something more in life. Mel Gibson as Rocky the rooster didn't really add all the much to the core of the story in my opinion. But for a stop-motion animated comedy. This might movie like a reviewer said might be slow for some kids, including me when I first saw this. But it's still a movie that the whole audiences can enjoy.7.8/10",7,0,0,20 May 2014
Orphan," Slow but decent thriller
","Well I got what I expected out of this film, except the twist near the end. The film has a very slow start with more of the jump scares than it actually building tension. The story went about what I expected besides it being more of a thriller and didn't really go in the horror direction. Besides it being pretty slow a lot of people seem to be satisfied cause of the big twist near the end of the film, I will admit I didn't see that one coming and it was original, also shocking. But I found it to be a bit stupid and lame, if you see the movie you will understand what I am talking about cause it leads to a lot of plot holes that don't make any sense and ruins her character which was actually quite intriguing at first. Besides Esther (Isabelle Fuhrman) who did a remarkable job playing a menacing character, Max (Aryana Engineer) was the most adorable child character I have ever seen in a movie and stood out a lot. I was expecting this film to be better cause I had a pretty decent expectation for it, despite it being sort of a clichÃ© thriller and using a child antagonist to spice things up a bit it was a darkly humorous and pretty disturbing movie that is worth a look. The main thing that irritated me was Daniel Coleman played by Jimmy Bennett, it was like the writers weren't sure to kill him off or not the kid is literally like Kenny from 'South Park'.7.6/10",7,2,3,20 October 2009
Spotlight," Very genuine but boring movie
","This is one of those films I have respect for it being genuine and not trying to be more than what it is. But since I give my honest opinions on movies, I will still say this film was actually quite boring for me. Again I have respect for this film not bringing false parts to sell tickets but try to stick very close to the source materials. Kind of like what honest journalist would do, instead of faking a story to get the news across while exaggerating the whole ordeal. This is the opposite of a exaggerated film, most of the actors doesn't try to outshine others or try their best to act out more than others. They try to convey the characters in a very genuine manner. The plot is about a group of journalist going after the truth of what went down with the Catholic priests in secrecy. And it goes in a realistic direction throughout the whole process. There isn't any life threatening moments or secret societies or any of that stuff. It's a very genuine movie, showing what appears to be real people going after truth and justice. The acting is really good with characters that appear to be real. This is a pure story showing film and I give it respect for that.7/10",7,1,2,23 July 2016
Terminator Salvation," Has it's flaws, but still underrated and is worthy to be part of the 'Terminator' franchise
","While all the previous movie takes place before the machines takeover and it's mostly all before the nuclear holocaust. This movie takes place during the main war with humans against the machines. The set pieces and design of the scenery is done very well, in fact it's entertaining to just watch the scenery in this which takes place in a apocalyptic land. It basically looks like a future war zone so it fits the plot almost perfectly. Although Christian Bale got made fun of because of his sort of Batman like voice, overall he did a great job playing the role of John Connor. He fit the role of the leader of the resistance and fit the image as well. Plus it was cool to see John Connor's potential the previous movies in this franchise kept talking about. Sam Worthington was just okay, I guess. The cameo appearance is meant to shock the audience and probably wanted the a applause out of them, because it's a scene for the fans but it just wasn't that effective. The plot also deviates from the previous movies a bit, but that didn't really effect the movie much. Maybe fans of the first two movies might be a bit disappointed with this movie, but overall this is a highly entertaining movie. And got my attention from beginning to end with it's action sequences. The camera work/special effects are top notch in this for 2009 as well. Unlike the previous Terminator movies, this one is mostly about the war in the future with the resistance fighting off the machines for their survival. When it all comes down to it, this is far from being a bad movie. In fact it's worthy to be part of the franchise for the most part. Maybe it can get better if Arnold reprise his role as the main character in the next sequel.7.7/10",7,0,3,8 May 2011
Insomnia," Although it moves a bit slow at times, still a good suspense drama
","Although I don't think this is one of Christopher Nolan's strongest films, but it was still pretty good and had a good story which is what his films are mostly known for. One of the quotes from the movie is 'a good cop can't sleep because a piece of the puzzle is missing and a bad cop can't sleep cause his conscience won't let him'. And that is what the story is about while getting blackmailed by the killer who tries to convince the detective that they are both in the same situation. And if the end sometimes justify the means. Unfortunately the killer isn't the least bit interesting although the film starts off by making the killer seem like a interesting character. Although the film moves a bit slow at times, has a well woven plot that will keep most audiences intrigued from beginning to end with it's drama and suspense. The main reason I saw this is because it's a Christopher Nolan film and it didn't really disappoint.7.8/10",7,2,3,22 January 2011
500 Days of Summer," Real, true to life, relateable and refreshing romantic comedy
","Now this is a very original romantic comedy, sure it isn't a laugh out loud movie but the story and everything else is so well done I couldn't careless. Now if there is one negative aspect of this movie is that the guy protagonist played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt doesn't really talk about the girl's personality who he fell for and felt a slightly pretentious. But I really liked his character in this, maybe it's because I can relate to the protagonist in this movie. What I really enjoyed was that this isn't a straightforward and narrow romantic comedy and the nonlinear narrative structure works really well in this. It's a movie that is film that is easy to relate with and I liked the chemistry between Summer(Zooey Deschanel) and Tom(Joseph Gordon-Levitt). I also really enjoyed the soundtrack to this movie, they really couldn't have picked better songs. The relationship just seemed so real especially how Tom starts falling for the girl. Even parts about him wanting a girl that he thinks he will never have a chance with and the building of his frustration because of this was all believable. Some reviewers claim this movie is refreshing for a romantic comedy and I have to agree and will help notice the little things in relationships as well. Despite the realistic elements in this, it's not boring or at least I wasn't. I highly recommend anyone that likes romantic or romantic comedies to see this movie, heck go see it even if your not into this type of genre.8.2/10",8,0,2,10 February 2011
L.A. Confidential," Brotherhood of cops noir
","Sometimes Cops can thing they are above the law and thus comes about police brutality. But this movie shows up is the limit and what is right and wrong in order to get the job done and taking down the bad guys. This is noir done right with some great storytelling. It really does get down to the dirty aspect to the police force back in the early 50's and has enough grime and grit to intrigue most audiences that is into this type of genre. Even if your not into this types of genre, it's still a movie that should be watched by anyone at least once. The story revolves around 3 police offices one who is a smart and yet not willing to bend when it comes to the law no matter what and is a bit of a snitch. Also sometimes he comes off as a character that cares about the image he thinks up for himself than actual integrity. The second is a hot tempered cop that is willing to get his hands a bit dirty in order to get the job done and unleashes his own person justice. The third is a selfish cop that only care about himself and nothing really matters as long as he reaps the benefits and there is a payoff. The movie will have the audiences attention because it's entertaining with it's intelligent investigation and put together well without it being way too convoluted, the way it's all connected is integrated in a way where you can't help but pay attention to what is going on. And the audiences are going to have to pay close attention to the investigation to get the most out of this movie. The dialogue is also sharp and the acting performances are the same as well. I was looking forward to seeing how every piece of the of puzzle is gonna be made at the end. And the ending is good and the puzzle to the investigation is put together almost brilliantly. So overall I am going to have to give this movie a 8.5/10.",8,0,1,5 December 2011
The Jungle Book," A Disney movie that stands out from my childhood
","This is one of the most memorable Disney movie from my childhood. And watching it now, I have more appreciation for it. It's actually based on a story about a human boy that was raised by wolves in the jungle. And how the boy adapts and becomes part of his environment. It's actually quite a tragic story, but this is a Disney movie so they want to liven things up a bit. I would say the chemistry is still intact when it comes to the human boy Mowgli, 'Bagheera' the Panther and 'Baloo' the Bear. As a matter of fact, this movie revolves around the chemistry between the three and different opinions amongst them. So yeah, this is a Disney movie that has some good elements to make it worth a watch. Maybe even worth a re-watch.8/10",8,1,2,23 September 2014
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," It tries to go in the grand finale direction, but doesn't really pull it off all that great
","Compared to the previous movies in this franchise, this one has the most budget and the most plot going for it. And is a good 3rd movie when it comes to ending the trilogy, well that is until the 4th movie comes out in 2011. But overall when it comes down to it all, this trilogy is a amazing adventure that is worth seeing all the way through. This installment however seems pretty forced in some areas and although Capt. Jack was fresh and unique before, his character comes off slightly old in this. The plot comes off way more convoluted in this and yet not very memorable or stands out like the first movie in this franchise, while the supernatural aspects goes over the top. For a family movie, the convoluted plot gave the whole thing a negative direction instead of a positive one. It's good they tried to put more emphasis on the plot this time around, but the direction of it all wasn't crafted very well. However on a positive side the special effects are top notch in this and the visuals are really well done. The action sequences such as when the pirates are battling on land and on ships is amazing at times. Even if the creators of this flick tried a bit too hard to make it really epic since they though this is going to be the final installment and wanted to go for the grand finale direction. It's better than the 2nd film in the franchise and overall with all three movies together it was a spectacular adventure.7.6/10",7,0,1,9 May 2011
Don Jon," Not all that original
","This movie has it's moments, but it suffers from something similar to what 'The Bling Ring' 2013 suffers from. It has a interesting and attachable concept and ideas going for it. But it's direction and execution is poorly done. Kind of amateurish, but it's from a first time director. What makes this movie stand out, is how it relates to some males out there. And some females as well. This is a observation movie coming from the thoughts of the protagonist, well the observation and mindset of Joseph Gordon-Levitt. I thought the first segment got the point across, but it decides to rinse and repeat. Which would have been fine if, it added more to the substance of it all. I guess it's to show the repetition of life for some. But it just doesn't work as a whole, since after it gets it's message across it didn't seem to add anything to it. Well at least not enough. It is a confident movie, but I don't know about it being edgy or all that original. This movie started out with an idea, but just didn't have enough to have that momentum going. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a character actor and it shows in this. He manages to pull of something different just about every time. Scarlett Johansson was fine in this as well.5/10",5,2,8,14 October 2013
X-Men," Very good start to this superheroes series
","I remember watching this in theater when it first came out, it was probably the first superhero movie that I thought was done right. It didn't have a lot of comic book feel to the movie in my personal opinion but it was a good comic book movie. It was fun and engaging from the beginning scene all the way to the end. Some scenes seem a bit lame at times, but for the most part the action sequences were pretty good and the dialogue wasn't too bad. Just about every character in this movie was near excellent for there roles, not all but some. Especially Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, I can't think of anyone else who would have played this character better, it was simply near flawless. This movie is directed very well and just by watching this movie I could tell Bryan Singer is a comic book fan or just really good at adapting. Even if it's not completely like the comics in some aspects it still did a pretty good job with everything else.7.5/10",7,0,1,28 June 2011
Spider-Man 3," It was very disappointing third installment, but it isn't that bad.
","Yeah, after one of the best superhero movie ever. This third installment was a big disappointment, mainly because of how good the second one is. So when I first got a chance to sit in a jam packed theater when this movie first came out, I was thrilled. That is until the story started to progress. Now I know it isn't all Sam Raimi's fault since he didn't want that many villains in his movie. But he just didn't have that much control because Sony decided to but in and oversee the production of this film. Now this isn't a bad film, but it just lacked the uplifting, emotional power mixed in with entertainment value the first two has. That isn't to say this is a bad film, it does have it's moments and I thought for there being 3 villains, the flow wasn't terrible. I mean it could have been way worse, but Sam Raimi managed to pull it off with what he was forced to do. This is why Spider-Man 4 didn't happen because Sony tried to take away a lot of control from Sam Raimi which ticked him off. The problem is that although there is a lot going on, it just couldn't delve into everything it was trying to do. And some stuff like Venom just seems to be shoehorned in there to please the fans. However watching this movie again leisurely in the comfort in my own home, I thought it wasn't that bad. After trying to absorb everything this film had to offer, the flow wasn't terrible and I thought it was a watchable movie. And even the emo Peter Parker dancing scenes despite it being super cheesy wasn't cringe worthy. Overall, this is actually a watchable finale to this Same Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy and ties up most of the loose ends. Lastly, Aunt May is a warm and wise woman. It was always a pleasure to see her give Peter advice when he was dealing with his demons throughout this trilogy. I really appreciated this movie more as an adult than I was as a kid. I also think that it's cool that Spider- Man wear his mask to protect his loved ones, but also to not show His fear to his enemies.7.3/10",7,2,2,13 June 2016
Match Point," A decent Woody Allen film
","This story is about a man's love affairs and how it goes spinning out of control with the decisions the man makes and how sometimes luck can also play a bit part. I will say that Jonathan Rhys Meyers a amazing job playing the little weasel that uses his wit and charm to get what he wants and his character will probably stay with me no matter what different roles he may take, he was just that dislike able in the film cause he played the character so well. 'Match Point' is a movie that takes a bit of time to get into it's clever territory with sophisticated characters study. I thought the performances were great although I really dislike Emily Mortimer cause of her cracking voice. It was cool to watch how sometimes luck can make difference in a person's life even if you don't believe in luck. This film is not a masterpiece, but a decent film. But the good dialogue, performance and plot will draw you in. The problem about this film is that it takes a lot of patience to get to any plot development.7.5/10",7,1,1,10 October 2009
Yes Man," Yes, it's worth checking out.
","This was a surprising comedy, because I thought I won't like it that much and would end up a below average comedy. Even the trailer didn't seem that good and not very interesting. And even when the film started I just wanted to hate it but as the film progressed I started to enjoy it bit by bit. Most comedies usually have a strong start but start to lose it's flair after a while, this isn't the case for 'Yes Man'. This is a movie to get back to the younger audience for Jim Carrey where the premise is sort of similar to 'Liar Liar'(1997) except he isn't forced by some supernatural powers to say yes to everything. While in 'Liar Liar' he could not lie because a curse was on him. In this movie he says yes to everything because it opens up doors for new opportunities in his life and it works for the better for him and by saying no he thinks bad stuff will happen to him because he makes a covenant, coincidence or not. But it just isn't something a lot of people hasn't seen before. Jim Carrey's character is one of those guys that stays in his apartment most of the time and hardly has interest in women and says no to just about everything. But that changes when a friend of his suggest he go to a seminar that could change his life for the better. And than his journey begins with random stuff happening in his life when he starts saying yes to everything while being obnoxious and retarded to the point you could tell Zooey Deschanel who Jim Carrey's character falls for is annoyed by him even while trying to act. This is a okay date movie as well since it's actually quite amusing at times and like I said has it's moments while going the romantic comedy direction. Although younger audiences will probably enjoy this movie, it just isn't really appropriate for them. It would have been cool though if they pushed the yes factor and made Jim Carrey do even crazier stuff.7/10",7,2,2,11 November 2009
Resident Evil: Extinction," Well...Better than the first two installments
","This starts off almost exactly like RE 1 and makes the audience that has seen the first installment think they are having a deja vu which adds a nice touch to the movie since it starts out with a bang. Although repetitious and dull at times, the director did a decent job with this installment well at least slightly better than the first installment and most definitely way better than the second one. Now it clearly shows that they don't give a crap if it relates with the RE video games or not and just want to cash in though, well at least it was somewhat entertaining.The plot this time is mainly about survival as well, a group a survivors including Alice is trying to survive the zombie mayhem while the head researcher in Umbrella Corporation is trying to find the real Alice for his projects. What I didn't like is how it added psychic powers in the game, which it showed in the second movie in the series. It just did not fit in with this type of movie, even if it's mostly sci fi, I didn't like it, this isn't freaking X-Men. I also didn't like the character L.J., he was annoying in the first movie and is more annoying this time around. Basically a pointless character and a pointless character in the second one as well. When it comes to animal zombies, first it was dogs and now they also have crows in this one which is one of the coolest scenes in the movie when a mass amount of zombie crows start attacking the survivors. Watching the zombie crows was much more entertaining than zombie dogs, I mean kung fu and dogs just looks plain stupid. And sometimes it seems like a war movie with zombies, so yeah although the story is really weak it does have some cool scenes and wasn't annoying to watch. All in all, this is a pretty good popcorn flick.7.2/10",7,2,5,11 September 2010
Midnight in Paris," Some people want to see the future some wants to experience the past
","Have you ever wanted to exist in a different time period in the past? Well that is the case with Gil Pender(Owen Wilson) who also has a huge infatuation with Paris. And has a bigger infatuation for the 1920's a time period where some of his favorite writers lives. And he literally thinks that is the golden age. He is a script writer for movies in Hollywood but wants to be a writer in Paris. It might be more risky and might not be financially better than working for Hollywood but that is what he wants. So this movie has different themes and different questions on life, especially romance. One is would you choose to struggle and do what you want to do or be in comfort zone over where you want to be. The couple Gil Pender and Inez(Rachel McAdams) are complete opposites, sometimes opposites attract and everything is fine but that isn't the case here. Pender is free spirited and isn't always logical and goes with the flow and his dream while also having a bit of anxiety and his fiancÃ© is confined to comfort and how society do things. But one day something magical happens, kinda like Cinderella except the magic starts at midnight. And is sent back to the 1920's and experience that time period and meet the writers he admirers. Micheal Sheen plays a character in the present who is basically the epitome of a pedantic character. Basically a know it all that shows off his knowledge of the past but doesn't have any creativity and imagination. And is superficial like Inez and is proud because of his knowledge. But Gil is the one that lacks in art history but wants to create his own art. So the movie is basically colliding of imagination, creativity and free spirit over comfort and society.Before A man falling for a woman in a different era also plays a part in this. This movie has multiple themes and different things going on but it rarely goes in a inconsistent direction. This movie reminded me of 'Before Sunset' except it's more broad and isn't just about 2 characters discussing there view on life. And 'Night at the Museum' with a much much better script. Yeah some stuff don't fit together completely when it comes to the past to the present, but not everything has to make sense. If you know some of the writers, musicians and painters than this movie will be way more enjoyable. Cause it's like watching historical characters you know in a movie.8.2/10",8,0,0,7 July 2012
Zodiac," Intriguing and suspenseful
","Fincher is one of those director's that seem to enjoy doing mystery murder movies and he does his job very well. Although this film is over 2 hours long, the way Fincher directed this and the material really intrigued me. And got me really interested in figuring out who the Zodiac killer really is. It's kind of sad to give a serial killer so much attention when the victims just dissipate. However this is a mystery film that revolve around a serial killer that called himself the Zodiac and the outcome of what can happen when a serial killer gets too much publicity and attention from the public. How sometimes certain crime can be a publicity stunt that can lead to others joining in. How assumptions can arise from dumb intuition to paranoia. Sure a lot of it has to do with the Zodiac, but it's mostly about the outcome and it's effect on people. Fincher really did put in a lot of detail in this film to the point, the investigation and interrogation process was interesting and their was suspense and tension during certain scenes to the point it has the capability to make the viewers paranoid. Most of the focus is on Robert Graysmith who is actually the author of the book this film is based on. Graysmith is a newspaper cartoonist who gets way too obsessed with the Zodiac killer. Like the Zodiac is a killer with grand plans, a methodical killer that is scheming something way more then he is showing, that there is some sort of in depth pattern to it all. The secondary character is The inspector, David Toschi who puts in a lot of effort into cracking the case and finding the killer. Overall this isn't a movie that is focused on the graphic killing spree although there is few. It's more about the attention to detail that really grabs the attention and interest which develops into suspense. Overall this is a very underrated Fincher film that I would highly recommend.9/10",9,1,1,19 January 2016
Milk," Impressive biographical movie
","One of Sean Penn's best performance to date, he just did a excellent job portraying the gay American politician Harvey Milk. This is a fine political film of people trying to fight for gay rights, during the 70's when gay people pretty much had a difficult time and didn't have as much equal rights. This isn't one of those movies I would watch again, but for the first time around I was impressed, especially by the superb acting and how it convincingly captures the truth about a whole political movements, and was even compelling at times. This is one of those movies that actually deserves the hype. It is thought provoking while showing politics and equality.7.6/10",7,0,1,15 February 2010
The Prestige," Batman vs Wolverine
","One of my favorite movie from Christopher Nolan, but what can I say the guy is a brilliant director. This film literally has style and substance, the plot with it's twist and turns will keep almost every audience entertained and intrigued. Even the ending is awesome and very original, it's those WTF kind of endings but in a good way. This movie isn't really a period piece although it takes place in Victorian era, it's more about the plot than the the time period and this was intentional as well and the plot is intricate and fascinating. It's basically about Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman who are magicians and basically rock stars of that time, going against each other and trying to beat each other at there own game, which leads to something much more. This movie is very entertaining and original, to the point right after I finished watching it I had to see it again.8.7/10",8,0,0,11 September 2010
The Terminator," Good start for a notorious sci-fi franchise and it's the film that was a big break for Arnold
","This is a excellent sci-fi movie for it's time, it has a lot of the elements in this mixed together but works very well. The main villain is the one that stands out the most, played by Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is basically a full machine in this literally when it comes to the plot aka The Terminator and he played his role in a pretty intimidating and menacingly manner, although he seemed a bit human at times when he is suppose to be a machine which isn't good. Especially since he is the villain and should not be showing emotions when it comes to facial expressions for this first movie in the franchise, even if it's slight at times. Although it will be different in the sequel, but for this it came off as a bit of a mistake, especially the mannerism in certain scenes. He just didn't seem like a full machine that is out to kill it's target because he seemed human, so it made the experience a bit slightly less frightening. But for it's time it's done very well. This is the beginning of a very notorious movie franchise that many people know of or at least heard about and I can see why by just watching this first movie. The script is well written and got my attention most of the way through even if it's a outdated and certain scenes just look way too fake. But even now this movie still holds up in today's standards because of the good direction and because it's well crafted. This movie also has classic phrases that are notorious and the way it reveals what is going on bit by bit is done pretty well, although some audiences will know what is going on pretty quickly, the execution is well crafted. This is a sci-fi/action movie with elements of horror and romance in it, but it's blended in just right and is worth seeing even if it's outdated by today's standards by a large margin and is a thrill to watch.7.8/10",7,1,2,7 May 2011
Cloverfield," First high quality found footage movie I saw when it came out
","This is probably the first high budget found footage movie I have seen. it's a giant monster movie that shows it from the normal civilians point of view with a simple story. The simplistic direction for the most part works for a movie such as this as a whole. Cause I don't see how making the whole thing more complex would make this film any better. It's sort of outdated when it comes to today's standards when it comes to movies. But then again there is multiple 'Paranormal Activity' movies that is just there to rake in the cash. Without giving much away, just think of a Godzilla movie except it goes in a found footage direction where just about everything is in first person view mode. And at it's core, it's a love story about a guy and his friends going the distance. I think this is the movie that started the high quality found footage movie trend. Overall, it was actually something new when I saw it in theaters in 2008. And it's still a watchable movie today.7.4/10",7,0,1,16 June 2016
Silent Hill," Decent video games to movie adaptation but just not a good movie
","This is a video game to movie adaptation from the video game franchise called 'Silent Hill'. And this is a mix of 'Silent Hill 1' and 'Silent Hill 2' when it comes to the video games that is integrated into this movie. The story sorta follows the plot of 'Silent Hill 1' but the premise and atmosphere is more similar to 'Silent Hill 2'. Anyways both games is about trying to find someone and that is basically the plot to this movie as well. A girl constantly calls out Silent Hill sleep walks a lot so instead of psychiatric the mother Rose(Radha Mitchell) decides to take her to Silent Hill although the husband played by Sean Bean is against it. And as farther it she goes into the town of Silent Hill things start to become nightmarish as more secrets unravel. Especially when the siren starts to ring. Unlike the 'Resident Evil' movies directed by Paul W. S. Anderson that has nothing to do with the video games. This one at least tries to be faithful to the video games this is based off of. Christophe Gans probably did his research and tried to please the fans of this video game franchise or something. Because the atmosphere and direction is similar to the game, even how items are found and etc. But the thing is some actions and scenarios that might work for a video game doesn't always come off as something positive when put into a movie. Rose just seemed to be off her rockers most of the time and her actions sometimes doesn't make much sense. Especially in the beginning where she tries to outrun the cop. Who is actually a character from the first Silent Hill video game play by Laurie Holden. That actually pulls of the character Cybil pretty well. The thing is watching characters go in the direction like video game character doesn't make it a good movie, especially since sometimes it feels like your watching someone play a video game but without the emotional tug and engaging story. And it isn't all that scary like the video games this is based off of especially since your not the one controlling the characters. I give it props for trying to follow the direction of the video games this is based off of but there is little to not tension in this. They got the atmosphere right but it just didn't have the psychedelic and ominous and yet dreamlike feel from the Silent Hill video games that it is known for. And those are the main elements that makes the games stand out. And some parts in this movie just seemed irrelevant and out of nowhere but that works in the context of the video games but not really as a movie. For a video game adaptation this movie is decent but it's not a good movie either.6.3/10",6,2,6,29 November 2012
Hotel Rwanda," A bit overrated but worth the time to see at least once
","Some people say that this is like the African version of 'Schindler's List' now I wouldn't go that far, but it still is a fantastic and powerful film. The movie is basically about the Rwandan Genocide that took place in 1994, where many Tutsi are killed by the Hutu extremists. Probably hardly any one cared about this atrocity that didn't have to go through it and I enjoyed the aspects of it showing why. Don Cheadle really was perfect for this role, and he put on a great performance here and it's one of those films he most definitely was worth being in. There is also a deep message, although it isn't a movie I would see multiple times or anything, but it was most definitely worth the time to see it at least once. If I can name one flaws is that you don't really care about the people that are trying to survive from the genocide, but maybe that is just the realistic aspect of it and why the message behind this film is deep.7.9/10",7,1,1,16 April 2010
The Hateful Eight," Very different western
","When I first saw the trailer to this, I had no idea what this film was about, except that it's a western. Let's just say Quentin takes elements from old westerns, television westerns and spaghetti westerns and mashes it into this in a very coherent manner. However for mainstream audiences, this isn't a western that you will be used to. With the hero fighting against bandits and stuff like that. Instead this reminded me of those who done it films, like 'The Thing'. It even has a unused track from 'The Thing' in this. When it comes to the plot, it's one of those 'who done it?' films. Except things get crazy and gruesome with the trademark Quentin style thrown in. With some amusing interactions amongst the characters, which is a staple for Quentin. This isn't really good as some of the previous Quentin Tarantino films, but it's still a bloody good time. It's a very unpredictable film with things happening that is relevant but very unexpected. It might take some time to get used to with it's slow start but when it hits it really hits. When it comes to the cast Kurt Russell did just fine, Walton Goggins really shocked me in this, Jennifer Jason Leigh put on a stand out performance. However this film seems to have be written just for Samuel L. Jackson, cause without Jackson I don't know who else could play his character. Overall, this is a good mystery, dark comedy, thriller that is worth a watch.8/10",8,9,34,23 December 2015
Dear John," Not terrible, but nothing special
","Now the trailer is just plain dull and boring looking to the point I wanted to avoid watching this. Now I like watching romance movies sometimes, but movies usually show the best parts in the trailer and this one didn't get my interest what so ever. Anyways I started watching this movie, and just like what I expected the beginning was plain dull and tries to make it way too clean and predictable with uninteresting characters. Now the set up is okay, but it has almost zero appeal. Basically it's too much of a feel good movie, mainly for girls. The only positive aspect of this film is the chemistry between the two lovers, which seemed pretty believable. It had it's moments although very few, and I slightly enjoyed it, but nothing special.4.5/10",4,0,1,12 October 2010
The Adventures of Tintin," A bit of a kids version of Indiana Jones and it's good
","Despite the slight hype that went into this movie, I didn't find this movie to be all that great. But it's still a pretty darn good adventure movie that kids and adults can enjoy, in fact it's a good family flick. I could also tell a lot of effort has be put into this movie and the animation is really well done. I never even knew about the comic book that this movie is based and although the comics came out in 1929. It still has that modern feel to it that seemed well fitted into the movie. Maybe Steven Spielberg was a fan of this comic to the point he decided to make a full animated CGI movie of it which is understandable. I would too as well if I was a director and was a fan of a series of something while growing up. Again I didn't find this movie to be amazing or anything but it's a pretty good adventure movie that is worth taking the whole family to see.6.8/10",6,0,1,6 January 2012
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Very entertaining western
","This is a really fun western and just about nothing about this film is dull or dry. Robert Redford and Paul Newman makes a perfect team, and even though they are bank and train robbers you can't help but want these guys to get away, they are just too charming and charismatic. The plot is entertaining and the dialogue is fun and witty, it really went the right direction. Two great actors in a film makes it even better, Butch Cassidy(Paul Newman) is somewhat of the brains of the operations and The Sundance Kid(Robert Redford) is the muscle or expert gunslinger. I personally think it would have been cool if they got a bit more in depth with the people that are trying to track them down and kill them which leads both the robbers to head to Bolivia. Redford and Newman really shine in this movie and I personally think it's at there best. This is a impressive film and a instant classic. If your into western movies, this is a must watch and I recommend this to any other movie lovers as well.8.6/10",8,0,0,25 July 2010
Ocean's Twelve," Just not as good this time around
","This one is just not as good as 'Ocean's Eleven' but it's still a watchable movie just not all that good. All that cast and crew are back and although they all seemed to be having fun at what they are doing and having a good time that is mainly it. The cool characters tries uber hard to be cool, 'Ocean's Eleven' just had the right amount of coolness when it comes to the characters. This one seemed to go a bit overboard. The story this time around is about the crew trying to get the amount of money they stole from Benedict or else it's their head. Which was bound to happen since they didn't focus on covering their tracks enough. Although Benedict got all his money back because of insurance. But there is also a rival thief and a female detective on their tail. Steven Soderbergh really did try to incorporate a good story in this one but it just isn't as exciting, entertaining and cool as 'Ocean's Eleven'. I know I am making references to 'Ocean's Eleven' a lot but this is just not as good. This one mostly focuses in on the characters which is fine but it's just not that interesting. And the end when it all comes together is probably more absurd than 'Ocean's Eleven'. It's a watchable movie but I doubt I will be seeing this one again.6.4/10",6,1,3,1 April 2013
Snatch," Many characters but it still works
","This has got to be one of my favorite Guy Ritchie movie. Now I don't really like all of his work but this is one of his best. This movie might not have that absurd and yet snappy dialogue and the level of humor compared 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. But the dialogue is still pretty cool and the other areas just got enhanced. Especially how it's more coherent and comes together in a more nicely wrapped package despite multiple different storyline of different characters. But it comes together much better in the end as a whole. This is one of those movie the more times you watch it the more you will appreciate this film. The way the characters act amongst each other is very entertaining to watch and what adds to the humor is the incompetence of some of the characters. In some movies it might get real annoying real easily, but in this it works. Jason Statham was a jewel hustler in real life before he became an actor and he portrayed a street hustler in 'Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels'. Anyways he was really good as one of the protagonist and fit the role really well as the narrator with his charismatic voice. Vinnie Jones is also back again in this, he plays the intimidating and yet engaging character really well. This time around he is more mean and merciless when he has to get his job done. Brad Pitt is in this and he plays a memorable and iconic character and is one of the character that Pitt would be well known for playing next to Tyler Durden. He is simply a scene stealer in this and not in a negative way either. There isn't really a distinct main character in this movie but instead has multiple characters that are interesting and actually fleshed out for the most part which is a hard task to do. Despite there being a lot of characters in this movie it all fits together quite well, just about every character has it's moment. Overall this is a great movie that is most definitely worth seeing. Especially for those that enjoy character driven movies with interesting characters.8.3/10",8,0,3,13 June 2012
The Beach," The pursuit of pleasure and paradise...
","This is a pretty good movie by Danny Boyle, I like this guy as a director as for Leo. Well I just wasn't fond of the guy as an actor at this time. Anyways back to the movie, I enjoyed watching some of the human thoughts and emotions that is portrayed in this movie. It's a exquisite film that makes some interesting points about people and life. Although I wasn't fond of DiCaprio as an actor at this time, his emotions was mostly believable in this. And the characters emotions is very very important for this movie. I am not sure if Leo was just playing Leo, which it seemed likely but it was believable. The plot is about a guy trying to move away from the life of just originality and problems people face during regular basis which I can relate with, since people want that sense of adventure. And when he finds the opportunity for a place of paradise he takes it, but he is in for more than what he bargained for. And no this is not a horror flick but more about human nature. The situation isn't all that believable but the some of the human nature aspect of it all is believable. So this is a character driven movie, and there is bunch of characters in this movie but for the most part you will no care for any of them. There is almost zero attachment to the characters in this. Even if the start of the movie went in a interesting direction the movie seemed to get dragged out after an hour an 30 minutes into it, although it's the climax. And also seemed a bit far-fetched as it went along. It just seemed a bit drastic and a bit out of nowhere. It's alright movie but when it was finished it just didn't leave that big of an impact and made you think.6.5/10",Null,0,1,4 October 2011
Fast & Furious 6," The most ridiculous and over the top installment in this franchise
","This is probably the most ridiculous and over the top movie in this franchise so far. And the previous movies in this franchise gets pretty darn ridiculous and over the top. The thing is there is some cool action sequences but I just quickly became numb to it. Especially since there just wasn't much substance when it comes to the story. It's basically the good guys team led by Dominic Toretto against Owen Shaw's team which the bad guys team. This whole movie however goes in a extremely superficial and lame direction it gets slightly annoying. Especially how all the character constantly tries to prove how macho they are. Especially Letty Ortiz who make it back into this franchise somehow which isn't really surprising. She is basically 'The Grouchy Ladybug' and is a laughable character. She even goes head to head with Gina Carano. Few of the humor works most don't but it's all corny as hell, like it's straight from some Michael Bay movie. Maybe even the action sequences as well. The thing is this movie seemed like the story revolved around the action sequences. Which means they probably planned all the action sequences then tried to figure out a way to connect the story to those action sequences. I heard the plane scene was suppose to be in 'Fast Five' but they took it out of the storyboard because of lack of budget and since it seemed random. I did like how it sort of connects all the previous movies into this franchise into this one. Anyways if your in the mood for a action movie with tons of action but forgettable characters despite it being the 6th installment in this franchise and lame story. You might enjoy this, well I thought it was a watchable popcorn flick.6.6/10",6,3,6,20 June 2013
The Expendables," Basically a homage to dumb action movies from the 80's
","After watching 'The Losers', 'A-Team' and 'The Expendables'. I personally liked the 'A-Team' the best with this movie coming in second. It's basically a homage to the dumb action movies of the 80's with bunch of well known action movies stars in it. The plot isn't anything spectacular or anything, but what lacks in plot it has some awesome action sequences although the explosions become tiring after a while. They basically used half the world's napalm in this. The problem is there is a lot of well known action stars with one real MMA fighter, but most of them just doesn't stand out what so ever. Although I seen better action movies from the 80's this one is still pretty good and if your looking for a lot of action in a movie, you will most definitely won't be disappointed. Not one of the greatest action movie you will ever see, but it gets the job done. If action, explosions, blood, sweat and one liners with tough guys is your thing, this movie is passable.6.9/10",6,1,6,16 October 2010
Final Destination 2," Basically the same premise but it is still a decent sequel
","This movie basically has the same premise but it is still a decent sequel because of the creative direction it goes with it. This lacked the creepy factor the original had but the deaths and direction of it all was slightly more entertaining in my opinion. Maybe because it is faster paced even if it goes in a more ridiculous and stupid direction it has more action going on with this one. Movies about death or grim reaper has been done before in the past but I liked how it doesn't show death in this franchise so far. But since the build up and the set up of what is going on has been done before in the previous film, it makes this movie more predictable. The death scenes are creative in a way but seemed way too forced. They way the characters work with each other to survive wasn't crafted all that great or effectively but it's passable. Overall it isn't a great horror sequel but it's still decent. Lastly the main positive aspect about the plot though is how it cleverly connects to the previous movie.7.2/10",Null,0,0,13 August 2011
The Flowers of War," Traumatic and powerful
","This is a war movie that will stick with you and leave a impact. There is so many depressing and sorrowful moments in this movie. The audiences is going to have a difficult time holding back their tears for this one. The main reason I decided to watch this movie is because it has Christian Bale in it cause I might have passed on this one if it didn't feature him in this. But I am glad I didn't let this movie just pass by. This movie takes place in 1937 and revolves around WW2 and Japanese invasion of China with the Nanking Massacre. Although the Japanese government might be trying to cover up a horrifying past and war crimes they have committed in the past. Can you imagine something very terrible done to you and your family and the culprit just denies because of reputation sake? This movie shows the brutality and pain of war, especially when it has invaders that doesn't have a conscience. The Japanese were barbaric and despicable during their invasion, they didn't just shoot people they tortured and raped their victims continuously. And this movie shows a vivid portrayal of so much pain and emotion that a bunch of Chinese women and girls had to go through. That even within the chaos there are people willing to love and sacrifice. In fact this movie has more to do with the emotional part during the invasion over showing a lot of the atrocities committed during the Rape of Nanking. Now Christian Bale was okay in this, he could have done better though in my opinion since I know he has some good acting chops by watching his past movies. He plays a man that may seem like just a stupid drunk at first but deep down he has compassion and morals. He becomes a guardian protector for the weak and oppressed...And no he is not Batman. The plot is basically about a man a mortician pretending to be a priest to protect the female Chinese students and prostitutes. The relationship that builds between the students and prostitutes is touching. Some may look down on prostitutes but the background of some of the prostitutes in this movie, it just hits right at the core of the heart. It's a simple story told in a emotional and powerful way and realistically, none of that Hollywood stuff. Although the production for this movie is really good. By the time this movie and ends and the credits roll I could not forget about this film, it stuck with me for quite a while. I had a difficult time sleeping as well. Overall this is a traumatic and powerful movie that needs to be watched at least once.8/10",8,3,4,31 July 2012
The Way Back," Journey for survival and redemption
","This is a connective and attachable flick, because of the relationship and comradery amongst the characters. All the actors and a actress put on a great performance. Nothing really stand out, but when it comes to the situation and setting of it all it just all works. The story is about few prisoners that escape from a prison camp run by the communist army. And start a 4000 miles walk to freedom. With the surrounding and what they had to overcome, it's a miracle the distance they go. Although it could have more substance to it, in my opinion like with the friendship and interactions. But it's still a emotional, heartfelt and psychological journey. That revolves around survival and redemption. The strength and will to survive comes off very real in this movie. Since this is based on a true story, it's somewhat like a realistic version of 'Lord of the Rings' kind of. Also it's nice to see Saoirse Ronan in this, the last flick I saw her in was in 'Hanna'. Although she isn't one of the standout part of this film, and I could think of other actresses that could play her role in this. I think there is a bright future for her in the movie industry. Overall this is a cold, but realistic heartfelt story that isn't easily forgettable.7.9/10",7,0,0,24 October 2013
Knocked Up," Terrible morals, but entertaining dialogue
","When it comes to morals this movie is terrible, but it's still a pretty entertaining movie. The story is basically about a fat hairy guy hooking up with a girl out of his league and also works for the entertainment news channel(not that I ever found Katherine Heigl ever attractive) but that is the point of view the movie wants the audience to have. But than again some audiences my find her hot, I just never really liked her screen presence in movies all that much. But she fit her role in this really well and made it work. Seth Rogen is entertaining to watch in this and isn't much of a shock that this movie was his big break. Besides the part about the characters having sex without a condom after getting drunk. The movie goes in a direction where it sort of sends a message that if you want a girl to be with you, just get her pregnant cause then the chance of her just dumping you is pretty slim. The movie has some clever dialogue and the interactions between the characters is funny and entertaining. This movie isn't super funny or anything like that and although the humor probably won't make you burst out laughing like crazy it still has what it takes to catch the audiences attention with it's character interactions even if a lot of it is them screwing around.7.6/10",7,0,1,11 March 2011
Begin Again," Over-hyped but still a good movie
","Maybe super music enthusiast will really enjoy this movie. I thought it was pretty good, since it has good music and good story. But it just wasn't this amazing movie I was expecting. It does have heart though, and the focus on how music can connect and bring people together was touching to watch. I liked the raw and realistic direction this movie takes. All the actors and actresses was really good and really poured their hearts into this movie. They sold me as people that are really really into music. It was a heartfelt movie that involves music and passion, but it wasn't to the point where it left a mark for me. However the main aspect I liked about this movie is the conflict of interests in a relationship and how the characters deal with it. I thought that was played very well.7.3/10",7,0,0,15 September 2015
Megamind," Decent drama and spectacular action animation
","Yeah the movie doesn't pull any real surprises or THAT original, but overall I enjoyed a lot of aspects of this movie than disliked. I avoided this movie when it first came out in theaters cause of what some of the critics were saying about it, so I passed on it. And when I saw it at a dollar theater in 3D it was really worth watching, the action sequences and stuff constantly going on was a lot of fun to watch. The animation is also very well done from the facial expressions to the action. The movie starts off pretty well and got a bit dull later on, but overall it really is a enjoyable movie. It was pretty cool to see things in a villains point of view as well in a 3D animation, even if 'Despicable Me' has done it as well. I didn't really like Jonah Hill in this cause the voice sounds just like Jonah Hill and thought it didn't fit that well, but every other voice actors and actresses did a very good job. It really is a enjoyable animation film for kids and adults and I recommend anyone that likes animation films to check it out. Speaking of 'Despicable Me' I liked Minion slightly more than Minions.7.8/10",7,1,2,26 January 2011
Alien," A bit overrated
","Although this movie was probably very good when it came out in 1979, while now watching it in 2009. The movie just seemed too dated, and I don't mean with the special effects, cinematography or anything like that. It's just that this film just didn't add any surprises, even when the audience comes across a certain twist it doesn't add anything to the movie that will add any shock value, the film just felt a bit dull and sort of boring. I can see how this movie would have impressed a lot of people who first viewed it when it came out. But watching a movie that came out when I wasn't even born, it just fell short of my expectation. This film is far from being a bad movie, it was actually good but I just felt that it was a bit overrated. The title of the movie is 'Alien', but the audience don't even get to see the alien all that much, well besides that there is little to no tension and most of the scenes are just a group of truckers in space that decides to go investigating in till they come across a unpleasant discovery and investigate some more, but none of it was intense or gripping. Although there are very few scenes of the actual alien, I get the feeling that they went that direction to add more fright, but didn't really work for me. A lot of the scenes were about the crew trying to find out what the alien is capable of. The movie also goes in a direction where you just don't care for the crew that is trying to survive. It was probably a phenomenal movie of it's time and did a lot for the sci-fi horror genre, but I ain't going to jump on the bandwagon and say this movie is the best in the genre.7.2/10",7,20,46,1 October 2009
Blades of Glory," Stupid but watchable
","So they decided to do a movie on figure skating since most of the other sports movies has been taken up. And I must say, as stupid as this movie is, it was sort of entertaining to some degree and is at least watchable. The premise is about 2 whinny figure skaters that get kicked out of ever competing after a incident and now has to work together in order to make there comeback as a double. The mainly most of the movie is about 2 whiny guys having to work with each other, while there other rivals are planning to sabotage there hard work in order to take the gold. Sound familiar right? Well it's cause it's a pretty generic flick, with some gay jokes thrown in. Ferrell and Heder work together alright, they basically reprise the same roles they do in there other movies. It's stupid, but watchable although you won't gain anything from it besides few cheap laughs. Rental at best.5/10",5,1,2,16 February 2010
Horrible Bosses," Probably the best comedy for summer 2011
","I didn't really have high expectations for this movie, but I heard positive reviews from friends so gave it a shot. I wouldn't say it's the best comedy I seen in a long time, but it's probably the best comedy I seen this summer. This movie kept me chuckling and laughing a lot of times, but the main aspect that makes this movie good is how it connect and it's clever with it while being funny. Yeah the characters are so goofy to the point it's not believable, but that element works in this movie. Some of the big name actors and actresses roles weren't that big but that really didn't matter, although Jennifer Aniston is still hot. Anyways the cast is what makes this movie work, because of the way they act and interact with each in a goofy and yet funny manner. It's immature and stupid and yet witty at the same time. Probably the best comedy of summer 2011, it would have been better if there was more to it, like some crazy that leaves a big impact. But that is just a very small complaint and overall it's worth a watch in theater with friends.7.6/10",7,1,4,9 July 2011
Black Mass," Despite it being fast-paced with lot of violence, it becomes repetitious
","The premise of this is actually quite interesting, especially about how the FBI backed up mobsters that turned informants. In order to wipe out and take down other criminals and in return get protection from the FBI through that process. It being based on a true story gives it more of a momentum. However the way the story plays out, becomes quickly repetitious. And sometimes just didn't flow very well with it's inconsistencies. At it's core it's a fairly simple story, I am sure their is more to the actual truth. But when it comes to the plot of this film, it's a simple story. But it sometimes seemed to drag and felt like it was all over the place at times, because of the pacing. It's a fast paced movie, but still seemed to drag. Unlike some other movies that deal with the criminal undergrounds, this one was difficult to get invested in. It was difficult to care about what was going on. All the actors did a good job and Johnny Depp finally after quite some time got to show off his acting chops. As this silent loose cannon, a ticking time bomb you don't know when he is going to go off. Overall, this is a movie that is worth seeing once if you like mafia and crime movies. But it's forgettable and you probably won't view it twice.6/10",6,1,1,10 October 2015
The Town," Not good as 'Gone Baby Gone' but still a solid movie
","This film is basically a heist movie with romantic elements in it. This movie proves once again that Ben Affleck has more potential of directing movies than acting in one, he plays the main character in this but he is alright. Although most of the movies he starred in sort of sucked, Ben has a bit of talent for directing. I also enjoyed his past movie 'Gone Baby Gone' which he directed and I enjoyed watching this movie as well, although I liked 'Gone Baby Gone' more better. Mainly because it just had a tighter script and more original compared to this movie. The movie basically takes place in a town that is known for breeding bank robbers, and some are forced into it. But during one of the bank robbery, Ben Affleck's character Doug MacRay and his crew take a girl hostage. And later ends up falling for her while trying to spy on her cause the crew lives close by where she lives and maybe a threat to them. Now this plays a part in the story but the whole film doesn't necessarily revolve around this scenario, which is a good thing. Jeremy Renner did a great job in this movie as the loose cannon style of criminal who is also part of the crew. Jon Hamm also did a fabulous job of playing the rough and tough FBI, who play hard since the criminals play hard. Blake Lively was just hot in this, her acting is alright and that is all I can say for her. This is a pretty solid movie, nothing really refreshing or original but the script is still pretty good and I liked the direction and style of it all. The acting is superb and the cinematography is pretty good and has a bit of the 'Heat' and 'Mystic River' vibe to it. Oh and the chase scenes and the shoot outs is just amazing to watch, there is some parts that seem to drag a bit but that is about it.7.9/10",7,0,3,13 February 2011
Underworld Awakening," The best in this franchise so far...Although that ain't saying much
","If you seen the past 'Underworld' movies that won't be much of a factor for this flick. It does show flashbacks of what happened all the way through to where this movie begins. So to the audiences that haven't seen the previous movies it won't effect this movie much. With that being said, this has almost nothing to do with the previous movie, even Selene's new found gift in evolution won't have much of a factor in this. Anyways this isn't the most story driven movie in this franchise although the others didn't really have a great plot either. But it's entertaining to watch somewhat because of the constant action sequences. Which is really a good thing for this movie cause when it started to delve and go more into the story direction it easily got boring and wanted the next action scene to come. The plot is basically this, it's not a complete vampires vs. werewolves anymore, but vampires against humans and a bit of a twist. The action sequences in this is done pretty well and cool, but than again this franchise is more known for style than substance. For some reason this franchise just didn't care for going in a somewhat story driven direction or just given up on it. Cause this one sort of reminded me of the recent 'Resident Evil' movies. But since this one had constant action that was entertaining to watch despite the lack of a good story I give this one a 6.9/10 can't really give it a solid 7. Selene is also more brutal and lacks compassion which might work, but it just seemed a bit out of character.6.9/10",6,0,7,3 April 2012
Suicide Squad," 'Assault on Arkham' is still the better movie
","Like most people, I was actually hyped for this film. Mainly because of the trailers, but then again most movies that had good trailers was disappointing this year. The film starts off with flare, especially with the introduction of each Suicide Squad members. But when they actually go on the main mission, things start to go downhill from there. It isn't a terrible movie, but it just isn't that stand out. With David Ayer previous films, he just seemed like the right director for the job when it came to this film. But the problem was David Ayer only had a short time to come up with a script for this because the studio basically rushed the guy. They basically gave him six weeks to write the script which is very short to write a coherent story with development and creativity. And that is what this movie lacked, which is creativity and development. No wonder why they went for the re-shoots, because instead of just going in the gritty direction the studio wanted it to be more fun and punk like. Mainly because the Bohemian Rhapsody trailer was very well received by the viewers and critics. And maybe because of the success of the 'Deadpool' movie. Anyways when the crew go on the main mission, it's just bland action with bunch of special effects with the team going in a very narrow direction. There just wasn't enough development for the characters and creative teamwork scenarios. Jared Leto was ticked off because most of his Joker scenes got deleted from the theatrical release. But I could see why, because it wouldn't work when it comes to the total context of the plot. The title is 'Suicide Squad' after all. There is just one action scene that stood out to me and that was when Deadshot played by Will Smith goes ballistic by accurately shooting his bullets at the mutated enemies. However another thing that stood out to me, is the darkness and pain within each of the group members hearts. Such as guilt, emotional scars, longing for redemption and longing for family and love. So although the Suicide Group members maybe the bad guys that did bad things but they ain't evil. So the missions is about bad vs. evil and I thought that was a cool premise although the direction was poorly constructed. If you want to watch a better Suicide Squad movie that has more believable character depth with the members actually seeming like the bad guys. Doing bad guy stuff while being forced into a mission by Amanda Waller check out 'Batman: Assault on Arkham'. In this one the transition between bad guys acting like the good guys was too drastic and the interactions between the characters just didn't give off that vibe of bad guys talking with one another. Overall, it's another forgettable watchable flick. Which is a shame because the characters seemed so interesting and it just came off as a missed opportunity. Oh well, hopefully the sequel will have these underdeveloped areas fixed and make it a more immersive and creative experience.6.5/10",6,1,2,8 October 2016
Shutter Island," Not horrifying or psychologically thrilling, it's alright though to some degree
","When I found out about Martin Scorsese directing a psychological horror film, I was actually thrilled. But after actually seeing the film in some degree it was actually a bit disappointing. Now if you read the novel this film just isn't going to be as good, so I heavely recommend anyone to see this movie without reading the novel cause it really does rely on the twist and turns although it's fairly predictable. Although the plot wasn't amazing or anything it was a decent movie, the acting was top notch and the cinematography and CGI was very well done. To some it up it's a pretty good noir thriller but nothing very special or anything, especially since the movie relies heavily on the twists and mystery but it just wasn't that great. And it just wasn't that horrifying or psychologically thrilling either, but still despite it's flaws the other stuff it done well. 7.5/10",7,1,3,11 May 2010
Captain America: The Winter Soldier," Epitome of a better superhero sequel
","This has got to be one of the best Marvel movies I have seen so far. It has just about everything I wanted to see in a Captain America movie. The first one was alright, but this one just blows the previous movie out of the water. It's just really cool to see Cap integrate and utilize his skill sets, and the movements and fighting skills was just super entertaining to watch. As a matter of fact this has one of the best hand to hand combat fights ever. The plot flows really well and the editing is done just right. The chemistry between the characters is good and just about all the characters are not wasted and actually has roles to play. Especially Nick Fury. When it comes to the action it's some of the best sequences I have ever seen. Especially since Cap doesn't really have legit superpowers all that much. So his vulnerability makes it fun, thrilling, and cool when he throws down with other human villains. Mainly because Cap and some of the villains pull of all kinds of maneuvers instead of just relying on powers and weapons (unless you count fists as weapons). And even Cap's main weapon his shield is utilized to another level. I think the bar for superhero movies when it comes to action has just gotten set to another level with this one.9/10",9,0,2,6 May 2014
Life of Pi," A movie you might have to ponder upon to know why it's a great movie...
","So this is a movie based on a novel, now video game movie adaptations doesn't seem to work a lot of times. But it works from novel to movies sometimes and I haven't even read the book. But it seemed like this is a great adaptation. Now I wasn't even excited for this movie or anything, when I saw the first trailer I didn't even know what this movie was about. It just showed a guy and a tiger on a boat. This kinda seemed like '127 Hours' and 'Castaway' combined kinda. But it is a more meaningful movie that has some deep messages to go with it. Now this is a family movie but youngsters probably won't be entertained much by this but for the adults that like psychological and spiritual movies just might dig this one. I can't really say I was very entertained throughout this whole movie, some parts seemed a bit slow for me. But this is just one of those movies you might have to ponder upon about after seeing it to know why it's a great movie. The cinematography is just vivid and beautiful to watch even if it's mostly nature. Most of the running time is taken up while showing the relationship between Pi Patel and a tiger and they are both stranded on a boat. And I especially liked how it didn't go in a far-fetched direction but you can actually buy into the relationship between Pi and the tiger. Overall this is a great movie that is worth seeing, just don't expect a lot of action or laugh out loud comedy. Although there are some witty and cute comedic parts in this movie. Without giving the ending away it leaves it up to the audience to choose. Although some might like the message and other won't.8.2/10",8,4,8,29 November 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," Revenge heist
","This one isn't as good as 'Ocean's Eleven' but it's better than 'Ocean's Twelve'. This is more of a mission to wreck someone by stealing from that person than just mainly focusing on the money. Although money does play a factor. Out of all the three movies in this franchise this one however has the most meat to it when it comes to the heist. And the crew is back to do what they are good at in a cool and stylish manner. And this time the teams main target is Willy Bank(Al Pacino) after he screws Reuben on a deal. The heist and dialogues have it's clever moments although some parts are just absurd and doesn't make much sense. It's a entertaining heist flick but just didn't stand out all that much to the point I could call it a memorable flick. On a positive note though the cast doesn't try way too hard to be cool, which just came off more smug and pedantic than cool. Overall this is a stylish heist movie that has some substance to it and is worth seeing at least once.7.3/10",7,0,0,2 April 2013
Lost in Translation," Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson has some good chemistry together
","The premise of this movie was hysterical in a good way, and will find it more hysterical if you are a foreigner cause of the different atmosphere. It's a down to earth story that gets the audience to know the depth of the characters more and relate to. Bill Murray was great in this movie although he played the a similar character he is in a lot of his movies, with his expression of 'what the hell am I doing here?'. I ain't that fond of Scarlett Johansson, but she was amusing to watch in this film and played her role well with just the right amount of emotion. I couldn't help myself but laugh out loud at a lot of the scenes when the characters aren't even trying to be that funny or over the top. Especially at Bill Murray expression when he feels and acts like he is in a place where he don't belong. Although the story only revolves around mostly 2 characters Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson, they are just lovable to the point it don't really matter if the other characters are like cardboard. 'Lost in Translation' is a story about Bob Harris(Bill Murray) who is an American actor that comes to Tokyo in order to do a whiskey commercial to earn 2 million bucks. And while staying there he meets up with Charlotte(Scarlett Johansson) who has a newlywed photographer husband, but isn't sure why she is even married to him. But the chance meeting between Bob and Charlotte affects the lives of both and they start to somewhat bond. The comedy is lighthearted and fun, as Bill Murray plays a confused actor who is also quite sarcastic, but also lonely. Surprisingly I was never bored while watching this film, it really does grabs the audience from beginning to end without anything blowing up. The chemistry between Bob and Charlotte work really well, cause if it didn't the film wouldn't nearly be as good. This was a story that sucks you in from the beginning and ends with a good finale. My complaints was that most of the comedy was Bill Murray acting awkward and confused most of the time, but his sarcasm is hilarious this time around that it's forgivable, including the lack of plot. The title of the movie is 'Lost in Translation' after all. This is a existential romance movie about two characters that are unhappy and lacks a sense of direction when it comes to their lives. About them meeting and experiencing life together for a week in japan. Although they both come from different backgrounds from one another. One being a old movie star and the other being a recent college graduate. This is a movie about discovering a different culture and discovering parts about themselves. 8.3/10",8,1,2,22 October 2009
Tangled," Predictable in every way but still magical adventure
","Now this is a very generic and predictable adventure and if you seen enough Disney movies, it's obvious the stuff in this have way too many Disney clichÃ© going on. But the thing is, it's still a magical adventure and is still worth seeing it in 3D despite the narrow and predictable story. At first I was just going to pass on this movie, but the 260 million dollar production value got me interested. And let me tell you, this movie is just gorgeous to look at with some amazing and fluid animation. And despite the Disney clichÃ©, it has elements that kids will most definitely enjoy and most adults will have a good time as well. All the audience in the theater seemed to have a good time watching this, so if you want to watch a movie you and your kids will enjoy I highly recommend checking this out.7.9/10",7,3,6,29 December 2010
Doctor Strange," Strange but fun experience
","With a lot of superhero movies that came out in the past with the hero fighting against villain or villains. They needed to bring something new to the genre to keep things a bit fresh. And 'Doctor Strange' is the film the Marvel Cinematic Universe needed to bring to the table. While past good or even great superheroes movies delved into science fiction and Norse Mythology. It is for the most part grounded in reality despite other worlds and superpowers that is already set and predictable. Now it delves into altering reality and time by using mystical arts. Even going into astral and multiple dimensions. I wasn't sure what to think of this movie when I first saw the trailer. Because I usually found magic to be pretty boring in comic books because there really isn't a set of laws and there isn't any boundaries. So the possibilities are endless. Which can lead the hero or the villain to just use magic in just about every circumstances to overcome or avoid a conflict. Thankfully this film cleverly constructed it to make it seem like the heroes were actually in jeopardy. And added stakes to the conflict the character Doctor Strange must adapt and grow wiser and selfless in order to conquer. By washing away parts of his arrogance, selfishness and cynicism. But even in the beginning with those traits he did came off a charismatic and even sort of magnetic. Because of Benedict Cumberbatch's performance, because he is such a likable actor. He was hesitant about taking on this role but I am glad he did. Plus a lot of doctors have a bit of a god complex because of their profession anyways. When it comes to the special effects, CGI and action sequences it nothing like I have ever seen before. I mean I have seen some aspects of it, but not like this. What makes the action sequences stand out in this, isn't just the mind bending kaleidoscope like settings but it's clever choreography and execution. When it comes to the plot, it is a bit of a generic superhero origin story but that didn't take away much from the experience. Although I would have wanted more depth to Doctor Strange's downfall of the pain and turmoil he has to go through. So when he is able to rise, there would be a bit more impact to it. Plus I also though the training aspect of the plot was a bit glossed over. But I guess that was to quickly get to the superhero elements because they were on a budget after all. To sum up the plot, it's a mix of The Matrix, Iron Man, Inception, Kung Fu Panda and Alice Through the Looking Glass. I personally think it's okay to borrow elements from other movies as long as at it's core it does have it's own originality. And for the most part this does have it's own flare to it and it's own unique elements at it's core. I highly recommend you check out 'Doctor Strange'.8/10",8,2,5,6 November 2016
Pacific Rim," Entertaining and smashing sci-fi movie of the summer
","This is a badass robot against invading monsters or aliens movie that goes in a anime/manga style direction even when it comes to the style of dialogues. But it all works together well and it's a entertaining kick ass of a movie. You want to see huge gigantic robots fighting and bashing the hell out of the enemy. Well you will get plenty of that in this movie. Just when I thought this movie is coming close to an end it throws more stuff at the audiences but in a good way. When it comes to robots beating the crap out of stuff, the more the better as long as the story and effective cause is in motion. The story isn't anything gripping or emotional but it gets the job done for the most part. And the build up to the main battle might be a bit slow after the intro but the direction is good enough for the wait. The cast is alright with Charlie Hunnam being the weakest despite him being the main character, he is kinda bland in this movie. He just sort of reminded me of Jax Teller from 'Sons of Anarchy' even the way he walks. This is a entertaining big movie that I wouldn't mind there being a sequel for. From Guillermo del Toro who directed this movie, claims there is still a lot of ideas he wanted to use but didn't have the budget for or fit the structure. So wants to show that if there is a chance for a sequel.7.9/10",7,1,6,19 July 2013
American Sniper," Cynical film
","Without coming off ignorant, I could see why this movie would be a hit but that doesn't mean I think the movie is good. Yeah, this is meant to be a black and white movie. That focuses on the a Sniper that is known for a lot of kills in combat. I don't think that makes this movie really patriotic or anything like that. Sure, the thing that stands out about this movie is how it's based on a true story. But in my opinion that also works against it as well. The acting is on target though. But when it comes the direction of it all, it comes off pretty darn cynical. I appreciate the men and women that protect and serve America. But this like I said just comes off very cynical. It's a simple black and white movie, and simple doesn't always make a movie better. The movie just seemed far from it being constructive. The movie seem to only portray all the positive aspects of Chris Kyle while shoving his negative actions under the rug.3.3/10",3,16,40,2 February 2015
The Devil Wears Prada," Sometimes it's kinda entertaining to watch adults act childish
","I don't really like Anne Hathaway and I don't think she is attractive like some people give credit for and just about any actress could have played her role, although she did a fine job. Meryl Streep however seems to have the talent to make just about any role she is her own, she was perfect playing the devil with somewhat of a human aspects that show during few scenes. Emily Blunt put on a good performance as well and actually somewhat noteworthy. It's basically about Andrea 'Andy' Sachs (Anne Hathaway) who is trying to become a good journalist and tries to work for Runway magazine and does anything they tell them to do, which is a supposed dream job for women everywhere. And as she goes farther into the company and become like them, she starts to lose her soul and who she really is. It's a entertaining film and isn't over the top or irritating to watch to the point of hitting your head or anything for example 'Confessions of a Shopaholic', I was expecting a terrible film and got a okay one instead, most people can guess what is going to happen throughout the main story. I also felt that Anne Hathaway's character changes way to easily throughout the whole movie, especially when the movie started coming to a end, it wasn't believable at all for her to change that drastically. It's one of those films where overacting carries the film. It give it a 7 since it was kinda entertaining watching adults act childish while not making me angry watching it at the same time.7/10",7,0,2,22 October 2009
Rocky II," Takes a few jabs but just doesn't have that knockout punch
","This is a decent sequel, not a great one but decent. So the it picks up right after the first one and now Rocky has gained some fame. However he still has a difficult time making ends meet, mainly because he doesn't know how to read. Thus has a hard time advertising products for commercials. Apollo Creed is still butt- hurt about the previous fight and is doing whatever it takes to get a rematch. Rocky wants to call it quits when it comes to boxing, but he is a fighter and thus he is in a dilemma. To either focus on his love life while struggling or follow through with his purpose and his calling. While the first 'Rocky' film was raw and real. This one is a bit cheesy and dragged out. And the build up to the ending fight just didn't hit as hard as the first one. Mainly because it didn't feel like a lot was at stake this time around. I mean there is, but the build up and the execution was just so much more fluid in the first one. And way more engaging, despite it being a simple story. The story in this is simple as well, but felt so darn dragged out sometimes. Overall, it's a okay watch it takes a few jabs but it didn't have that knockout punch in the end like the first one.7/10",7,0,1,10 January 2016
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," It's a passable installment
","Hmm I personally thought this second installment was pretty good. It isn't a amazing Star Wars installment, but I thought it was good enough. Maybe it's because of how bad the 'The Phantom Menace' is. But I thought the story was passable and moved along in a mediocre manner. Sure the romantic parts seemed so forced and corny. But it has enough lightsaber action and battle sequences to make it worth the watch. The acting isn't really good but Hayden Christensen put on the most wooden performance out of the bunch. And he is suppose to be a very emotionally driven character, but he failed because of the wooden performance. Despite Anakin being a incompetent apprentice because of him being very driven by his emotions, it was understandable to a degree. So I can't take that away from the character. But I do think the future Darth Vader could have been written better and more badass. I think George Lucas picked the wrong actor to portray one of the greatest villain in movie history. Overall, this is a okay installment, sure there is plenty of ways it could have been better. But it is a passable installment.7.2/10",7,3,5,8 August 2015
Romeo + Juliet," Baz Luhrmann imagery doesn't connect with the story
","'Young men's love then lies not truly in their hearts but in their eyes' is what sort of sums up this tragedy. And in this it shows the quickness in the two lovers decision. This story shows maybe there is love at first sight...Maybe. Now this is a classic romantic tragedy based on one of William Shakespeare's most popular plays. And it does a good job for the most part of staying true to the original. Except this goes in a modern direction in the 90's. With wild, quick, bizarre and zany approach to it all. The visuals are flamboyant and very colorful. But when it comes to Bas Luhrmann's imagery and style in this, I just didn't think it fit into the story very well. Sure adding modern imagery to a old play is a cool idea and may even work sometimes. But just wasn't digging the style when it comes to this story. The soundtrack is awesome like in most Baz Luhrmann films though. I think this movie was mainly a hit, because of Leonardo DiCaprio who is in the early stage of being a young heartthrob for teenage girls as Romeo. And is the movie that boosted Claire Danes career. Just about all the characters are over the top in this, especially John Leguizamo. Which does get a bit annoying after a while. Oh yeah, and Romeo's best friend reminded me of Chris Rock in this. But like I said Baz Luhrmann imagery and style works in his other films, but not in this one. And also seeing it now, his imagery and style just seems way too outdated. Which might be unfair but it kept me from enjoying this movie. I just couldn't get into it. When it comes to the modern setting, it just didn't make much sense when it tries to connect with the story. And I am not talking about how the guns are labeled as swords in this and the small stuff either. Personally I liked the Romeo and Juliet (1968) version better and looking forward to the 2013 version.5.9/10",5,0,0,14 August 2013
Gone Baby Gone," A great directorial debut from Ben Affleck
","Ben Affleck's directorial debut shows that he can be a good director, probably more than a actor. Well as long as he has the right source material. The story is written by the author Dennis Lehane and this movie is based off of it. Seeing how 'Mystic River' turn out to be a great movie. It's not a surprise that Affleck wanted to make his debut directorial movie with Lehane's story. This doesn't have that cold feel that 'Mystic River' has but it doesn't make it any less intriguing as it progresses. In fact this movie gets complicated as it progresses in a good way. So without giving much away Patrick Kenzie(Casey Affleck) is a private investigator that gets hired to find a kidnapped girl of a cocaine addicted mother. And he is partnered up with his girlfriend Angie Gennaro(Michelle Monaghan), Monaghan always plays the girlfriend or wife character well. And Capt. Jack Doyle(Morgan Freeman) is also head in the investigation. Throw in Ed Harris as Remy Bressant and you got yourself a great detective thriller style movie. This has some great dialogue and phrases that sticks with you. Anyways less you know about this movie the better. Overall this is a intriguing mystery movie that is enjoyable and sticks with you for a while. If you enjoyed 'Mystic River' there is a high chance your gonna like this one as well.8.6/10",8,0,1,29 September 2012
"Monsters, Inc."," Fun, cut and clever pixar film
","I wasn't really a fan of this Pixar movie when it came out and just thought it was a okay watch. Didn't really stick as one of my childhood memories or anything like that but when I saw it as a kid is was a good watch nothing more. And didn't really watch it again until now because of 'Monsters University'. When we were kids most of us was scared of the dark or afraid of ghosts and monsters. Well in this world monsters do exist and they go around scaring kids by coming out of the closet for energy supply. But the thing is the monsters are as much as scared of the kids as the kids are to the monsters. But the main conflict starts when a kid comes into the monsters society. When it comes to kids in movies it can be a hit or a miss but in this case she is adorable. While having the kid demeanor and although the cause of the conflict and what drives the story but didn't really get annoying. And seeing it now I kinda enjoyed it more than when I saw it as a child. And as the story started to build although it's a very simple story it was fun, cute and kinda clever. To the people that saw this movie when it first came out, it's worth seeing it again even if it's for 'Monsters University'.8/10",8,0,1,5 July 2013
Southpaw," More hit than miss
","Now when it comes to the plot, it's actually a very generic boxing movie that isn't all that believable. Watching this movie was like watching a boxing fairytale. It's like watching 'Rocky' except 'Rocky' just seemed like a movie to invest more emotionally compared to this one. Despite the fact that their is a lot of emotions from the characters in this film. This was suppose to be movie inspired by Eminem's life story, except told in boxing form. Em was actually given a chance to play the role, except he turned it down. Jake Gyllenhaal is a good actor and I did like his portrayal of this broken down boxer that goes from having everything to losing almost everything. He simply did solid job of playing this boxer with this ghetto demeanor going for him. The plot is about a boxer that has to start from the bottom to get to the top again. The thing is, there is just better boxing movies out there that is worth watching compared to this one. However, I will say it does have this inspirational vibe going for it, to not give up and keep on fighting. I liked that. I also liked the ghetto vibe going for this movie and the crisp boxing cinematography. I was looking for more depth to the story or something that really leaves an impact, but you won't find it in this film. Overall, this is a good boxing movie with a solid performance from Jake Gyllenhaal. It's not a performance that is engraving, but it's solid enough.7.1/10",7,0,0,5 September 2015
Ant-Man," Way Way better than I thought it would be
","I didn't expect a stand-alone Ant-Man movie but here it is. I knew it was going to be a heist movie. But I didn't expect it to be as good as this movie is. I didn't think it was a mind-blowing experience or anything like that. But it's a highly watchable and fun thrill ride from start to finish. I personally got to see this in 4D, the 4D wasn't as good as 'Jurassic World', but it really added to the overall experience. I will say I am very glad that Paul Rudd chose to be in this movie over 'Trainwreck', he was just so darn likable compared to other superheroes. And Michael Douglas was the perfect choice for Hank Pym. He actually made way more of an appearance in this movie than I expected (which is a good thing). Evangeline Lilly is hot like always. Oh yeah and Michael Pena was also a good comedy relief. The action sequences was really fun to watch in this and executed almost flawlessly and that includes the transition from scene to scene as well. Maybe it's because I didn't have that high of an expectation for this movie, but it really beat my expectations in almost every level. Movies like this show that you don't need a budget of almost 200 million or beyond to make a good superhero movie that has powers. There isn't as many carnage and mayhem compared to some superhero movies, but I liked this just as much if not more compared to some of them.8.2/10",8,9,20,13 September 2015
21 Jump Street," Way better than the trailer...Which is actually pretty rare.
","This is one of those few movies where the movie is better than the trailer. And the trailer ain't even misleading. Cause when I saw the trailer to this movie I had low expectations for it, but it turned out to actually be a funny comedy. I thought the comedy would be something similar to 'The Other Guys' which is a movie I really disliked. But I was relieved to find out that the two protagonist are idiot characters but they don't try to act so darn forced to act like idiots to be funny. This movie embraces stereotype in a funny manner sometimes, now the key word here is funny. Without it trying to be overly offensive or malicious while using these stereotypes. The partnership between the two protagonist is a dorky smart guy and a brainless jock that is actually likable. Anyways they didn't really get along or anything like that although the attended the same high school at the same time. But they both end up training at the same police academy and end up being best for buds. And after they both become cops they go undercover back to high school to find the suppliers for a drug that kills teens. But it's engaging and it's just never gets boring or start to run out of steam. Yeah some parts are just too stereotypical, but they don't go super overboard to the point the whole thing is ridiculous. Even the girl that the smart dork falls for isn't the hottest girl in school or anything like that. Cause the hot cheerleader falling for the kid with the heart of gold scenario has been done to death and not all that believable. But in this the guy actually might have a chance. Anyways when it comes to the undercover part which takes up most of the movie I found it intriguing how the popular jock back in the day end up chilling with the nerds and the smart dork hangs with the popular kids. So they both handle areas they never been before. And it's funny how things play-out. But what stood out a lot is how realistic and relatable it is when it comes to the teens in high school and what they do during free-time. This movie is just fun all the way through. When it comes to buddy cop movies, this is good as 'Rush Hour 2'.8.2/10",8,0,0,3 July 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," A superhero movie that I got almost exactly what I expected
","The trailer made this movie seem a bit above average, not amazing but above average. And that is what this movie was a above average superhero movie that is pretty good but not great. The build up to how Steve Rogers becoming Captain America is well crafted and the action sequences was entertaining to watch. I thought it would have been better if it added some aspects from the comics into the movie, but it's still a well paced story for the most part. Just about all the actors was great with there roles, I wasn't so sure about Chris Evans being Captain America but he pulled the role off really well. He was actually really believable in this movie and looking forward for him to appear in the upcoming Avengers movie. Hugo Weaving has always been great playing villains so it was a no brainer for him to play Johann Schmidt. To sum it up I got what I expected out of this movie, a good but not a freaking amazing superhero movie. I personally thought it was slightly better than 'Thor'.7.6/10",Null,2,5,4 August 2011
American Hustle," Such a overrated movie
","This movie is the epitome of a pretentious and self-indulgent movie. And not just for the director, the actors and actresses as well. It's a mediocre plot, with actors and actresses showing off how much of a dazzling and showmanship like performances they can pull off. Except maybe Jeremy Renner who actually put on a believable performance for the most part. It's somewhat of a serious movie with those awkward comedic parts. Now I am one of those audiences that likes awkward humor if it's integrated and utilized well but that isn't the case for this movie. Now I like David O. Russell past films, however this one suffers from too much ambition or something. This isn't a awful movie, but it's a snooze fest of a movie with actors and actresses playing childish and immature characters. Although the characters are suppose to be professionals. Now I have seen these types of movies before such as in Coen brothers films, Woody Allen films and etc. But in this, it just isn't done well and just doesn't have any of those clever or witty moments. Some critics seem to go on about how good the dialogues are, I personally can't remember a single one. I give this movie a 4.5/10 mainly because the ending is at least tied in well.4.5/10",4,3,5,6 May 2014
The Bourne Ultimatum," My second favorite in the Bourne franchise so far
","Jason Bourne is back and he is sharper and more agile in achieving his objectives. In fact that is one of the coolest parts about this movie since he knows exactly what to do and knows the method of doing it, in a very entertaining manner. Yeah, there might not as be as much tension because of this but that is just a very minor thing. Since this is still overall a clever and yet entertaining action flick that is fast paced for the most part. Out of the three films in this trilogy before the fourth movie will come out, but this is one is the most action packed compared to the previous two installments. The previous two Bounre films was about Jason Bourne on the run while trying to find out what is going on, this time he is going for the source. Although there is some chase scene with Jason Bourne doing parkour. Another minor complaint is how this one is more all over the place than the previous films in this franchise which makes the film a bit more complex looking than it has to be, even if it moves in a very fast paced manner. But the main negative aspect of this movie is how there really isn't much character development and even if there is, it's not done in a very memorable fashion. Overall though I really enjoyed this trilogy and maybe the future sequels, but this film by itself I am going to give it a 8.3. I can see how some audiences probably didn't enjoy it as much though because of the very serious and realistic direction it tries to go. But I personally think that is one of the aspect that makes this franchise good as it is.8.3/10",8,0,1,12 April 2011
10 Things I Hate About You," Despite the two likable actors, this is a slightly above mediocre teen comedy
","This is basically a romantic comedy, that is also very ridiculous and not very believable but still pretty good. While showing the trendy lifestyle of high school students in a over exaggerated manner. It's also stereotypical of teenagers in a shallow way. a To be honest the only reason I decided to check this movie out was because of Heath Ledger and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, because I like these actors and was difficult to pass on it. It's basically a wacky and silly romantic comedy and yet lively and enjoyable movie for the most part. The movie however starts off pretty good but after about a hour it starts to get a bit dull and too generic. I never been a fan of Julia Stiles though and she seemed more like Heath Ledger's sister than his actual girlfriend. Anyways overall this is basically a bright romantic comedy that almost anyone can enjoy without being grossed out. Just isn't anything ballsy or new or anything like that, it's also a very predictable movie.6.7/10",6,0,0,9 February 2011
Fargo," One of the best crime films
","This is basically Coen brothers classic breakthrough film. And the story is superbly put together and crafted so well. To the point it makes it one of the top crime films that is a must watch. It's a serious crime story shown in a subtle and yet engaging manner, with slight awkward humor in it. But still stays consistent as a cold story about greed and the distances some people would go for their ambitions. Like the incompetence of the criminals and how it leads them from one mistake to another, one trouble to another. And innocent people gets involved one after another, because of dumb ideas. However, although this story takes place in a dry and boring snowy town. It's kinda amazing how the Coen brothers could pull off naive and dense characters that are actually still believable, while also entertaining to watch. And when it comes down to it, the mannerisms and the demeanor of the characters is what really drives this movie. And the Coen brothers just nails and makes these awkward characters to be intriguing, because of the random and yet believable decisions they make. This is one of those movies that could have fell flat, but thanks to Coen brothers trademark directions. Thus it's amusing and even intriguing at times, because of the random and yet witty and clever storytelling. Overall this is a film with a dry and boring setting, with awkward and yet dull characters that is really worth seeing.8.6/10",8,0,0,2 September 2013
Rush," A rush
","This movie is fantastic. It turned out better than I thought it would and not as cheesy. I find stories about two different opposing forces that has the equal tenacity and drive colliding with each other to be awesome. In this case, one is the wild card, a charger that relies on his senses. And the other is the more disciplined one, the brain that relies on his calculations and instincts. Although the bad blood aspect of this film might not be real. There is just way more tension if you don't do research on the outcome, before watching this movie. Also this is a bit of a cheap shot, but Chris Hemsworth basically plays Thor with no powers in this. Daniel BrÃ¼hl was just awesome as Nikki Lauda. Overall this is one of the top rivalry films I have seen.8.2/10",8,3,5,14 October 2013
Nightcrawler," A bit overrated, but it's watchable because of Jake Gyllenhaal
","I can tell why this movie has been getting praise by critics. The acting and dark direction with nor morality can be deemed as cool to some viewers. And I even heard some reviewers claiming the main character to be someone you could root for. I will have to disagree, there is just about no character in this with any redeeming qualities. And that especially includes the main character. So the plot is about this guy who is psychologically disturbed and thinks he is smarter than everyone else. The guy has some mental issues, where he has poor interpersonal skills but thinks he knows exactly what to say to get what he wants. In another words, he is calculative, methodical and highly manipulative when it comes to getting what he wants. Even by doing things that are highly illegal. And you really get to see the darker side of this character when he feels desperate to reach his goal. Which can apply to a lot of people, but Jake Gyllenhaal really knows how to sell this character with his outstanding acting chops. As this really strange and weird character Louis Bloom who most audience could tell as the film progresses that their is something off about this guy. More than the direction of the movie which is about a Lois Bloom going around capturing accidents or harm to other people on camera in order to elevate his status with his naive partner. It's the character's sociopathic behavior and hidden agenda that drives this film in my opinion. Overall it's a watchable film that didn't really entertain me all that much nor did it really grab my attention with it's intensity like I expected. Good character development though.6.8/10",6,3,7,7 January 2015
Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping," Amusing comedy that pokes fun at pop culture and idolatry
","Although it gets a bit old after awhile, this is still a ingenious comedy that pokes fun at pop culture and how stupid worshiping idols really is. It's a parody comedy that is set in documentary form, kind of like those documentaries that try to portray how great pop singers are as they go on tour. Sure, this movie uses a like of pop- culture references and celebrity cameos for most of it's humor. But c'mon the title of this movie is 'Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping'. I usually found the The Lonely Island crew to be pretty darn funny with there skits and music videos. So for a movie like this, they really brought all their talents to the table. The direction when it comes down to it, is actually quite predictable and has been done before when it comes to the three amigos having a conflict with each other with one being the middle man. But it's not the direction that makes a movie such as this, but it's the process and how the interactions and humor plays out. I give this movie a 8/10 because of it's clever humor. I would have given it a higher score if it still carried the momentum it had that lasted for about an hour, then it started to go downwards. If this movie is not that funny for some viewers, it's at least amusing. Lastly the soundtrack for this movie is tight with it's original track, well at least for a comedy.8/10",8,1,2,1 July 2016
LÃ©on: The Professional," My favorite hit-man in one of my all time favorite films
","I remember watching this film as a kid and being blown away by how awesome it is. From the action, the characters and the chemistry between Leon and Mathilda it was just all so darn memorable and cool. Sure, the relationship between an adult hit-man and a 12 year old girl may sound like it's messed up. But Luc Besson makes the whole thing work by making the hit-man Leon to be so darn likable, professional and yet naive. This is the role that Jean Reno will be known for throughout his acting career. He plays this secluded, introverted and yet sensitive hit-man who is very likable for a hit-man. Maybe because of his naive personality and how he doesn't live a rich and fulfilled lifestyle because of what he does. Maybe it's because Leon is a character that has certain codes and rules that he abides by. And for a hit-man he has some integrity and compassion. Some of it comes from Jean Reno's personal idea to make his character a bit mentally slow when it comes to things that didn't involve killing. This movie was a big hit in Asian countries, especially in japan. And a some Japanese movies, anime and manga tried to emulate some elements from this film. The ideas about the character Leon and his relationship with Mathilda came about because of Luc Besson's personal relationship with a teenage girl who is much younger than he is. Even Gary Oldman puts on a very memorable performance as a corrupt cop. His performance might be a bit over the top, but it stuck with me and it works when it comes to the context of this film. This is Oldman's performance I mostly remember him for despite him being a great actor. It's close the the performance level of Denzel Washington from 'Training Day'. This is even the performance that made Natalie Portman who played Mathilda into a star. Again it's the performance I remember this actress the most for. She brings about a lot of raw emotions for a very young actress. The first door scene where she is trying to get inside Leon's apartment by saying 'please' made me feel for her character. In another words, overall this is the film that I remember all three actors for the most. Mix that in with one of the best script that Luc Besson has written so far and you got one of the best movies from the 90's. What made this film very lasting, impactful and memorable for me wasn't just because of the cool style of it all. And because of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. But because it has one of the best ending I have ever seen in film. It's explosive figurative and literally when it comes to Leon's final mission. Overall, this is a brilliant film with marvelous acting, characters and direction. This is part action movie, part revenge movie and part controversial romance movie that doesn't take it too far. While having a bit of artistic ambiance to it without it being pretentious. I personally think of this film as a masterpiece.10/10",10,2,3,16 January 2017
Oblivion," Entertaining, compelling and enthralling sci-fi film
","This is actually a really good sci-fi movie that isn't just full of sci-fi action but has a bit of humanity to it and goals when pushed into a corner while also including the human heart. I actually thoroughly enjoyed this movie from start to finish. It has a really good build up and well crafted and designed. The atmosphere, surroundings and design is really cool despite Jack's(Tom Cruise) costume looking very similar to the one Aki Ross wore in 'Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within'. And when it comes to Tom Cruise he is exceptionally good in this and brings out the right amount of emotion and facial expressions. He is a great actor despite the publicity he has been getting. In fact in some areas I think he is better than DiCaprio. Morgan Freeman also makes some appearances and like always he is a great side character and his presence in this is charismatic while also having some wisdom behind it. The story is memorable with a good build up, right amount of action sequences and gives almost the right amount of information on what is going on. And leaves the rest up to the audiences imagination while not insulting the audiences intelligence. Even if some parts of this film didn't make all that much sense, it's still passable and didn't get all that irritating. In some degree it felt like the opposite of the 'Tron' movies when it comes to the humans and machines. This is a entertaining, compelling and enthralling sci-fi film that is worth seeing on the big screen.8.4/10",8,2,6,24 April 2013
Watchmen," Not the typical superheroes movie
","Despite some reviews that give this movie a mediocre rating, I really enjoyed this movie and kept me entertaining from beginning to end for the most part. I got very slightly bored when the movie seemed to drag a bit although just about every scene is crucial to the story. What I really liked is how Zack Snyder stayed true to the graphic novel, I mean of course he had to cut a few parts because of the length and since the graphic novel is so long and he wanted to fit in everything important into one movie. But besides that this is a very good adaptation from the graphic novel, it's almost as close as 'Sin City'. The actors in this movie is flawless, the actresses in this is alright but the actors were phenomenal in portraying the graphic novels superheroes. Especially Rorschach(Jackie Earle Haley) who is all about justic, The Comedian(Jeffrey Dean Morgan) who is a mix of just and unjust, and Nite Owl II(Patrick Wilson) sort of a boring but nerd like character or just a very stereotypical superhero but plays a big part in the plot. Like I said these guys did a phenomenal job of portraying these characters, especially after I read few pages of the graphic novel I could tell they were flawless. Some people complain about the music in this movie, but I thought it fit right in nicely especially the time period the story takes place well except one of the sex scene. What is unique about this movie is that it doesn't mainly focuses on a superhero or a group of superheroes that is going after a villain or villains, but much more than that. I never even heard of the graphic novel until I saw the trailer to this movie, but bunch of nerds were claiming the graphic novel is a masterpiece and it's brilliant. From watching this movie, I still am not sure if it's a masterpiece but it was brilliant superheroes movie. The ending however is different from the graphic novel and I could tell why Zack Snyder, would decide to change the ending to something else. And I can understand why some fans have a problem with this, since if you think about it. It just doesn't make any sense, since human nature does not work that way. I would also like to add that there are critics that make fun of Zack Snyder's use of slow motion in his movies, but the thing is not only does he use it to make the scene look more cool it's effective so there really isn't anything to complain about in that department. The story is magnificent with the superheroes having their own flaws and two them having completely different direction and there was almost no dull moment and the 'what if' scenarios in this movie is done very well. Now this really is a must watch superheroes movie, naw scratch that this is a must watch for anyone that is into watching movies. There is a lot to digest in this movie so I suggest repeated viewing and my hat goes off to Zack Snyder for doing a great job in putting a graphic novel that most people said was impossible to be adapted into a movie into a movie. He did it and what a great job he did, must have been a difficult task. The director's cut version is also worth seeing as well, the extra minutes added some more enjoyment factor.8.8/10",8,1,4,1 March 2011
The Bourne Identity," A action spy-thriller that will inspire future action movies
","This is one of those action movies that will inspire other action movies in the future or at least the style of it all. I remember watching the trailer to this movie when it first came out which led me to watch this in theater the day it came out. And although when I first saw it in theater back in 2002 and didn't completely understand what was going on at that time during the first viewing of it. What I did know was that I actually enjoyed this action movie and was very entertained by it. This is a spy-thriller that is done right and is a fast paced and stylish action that hardly has a dull moment and is crafted very well for the most part. What I liked after viewing it again now is how it's somewhat simple and yet intelligent at the same time when it comes to the direction of the plot. Now I know this movie is based on the novel by Robert Ludlum and although I haven't read any of the Bourn novels I am pretty sure the author would have been proud and also relieved. Besides the fast paced, simple and yet intelligent direction, what really stood out to me was the fast stylized and yet realistic action sequences. Yeah the whole thing with the amnesia seems a bit generic and far fetched in this but that is a very small flaw. Even the chase scenes are done really well, so overall this is a solid movie that is worth watching and the other two sequels to come. And maybe even the sequels after that as well. In another words the future of spy-thriller/action movies is Bourne.8.5/10",8,0,1,9 April 2011
Hot Rod," The main reason I saw this is because of Andy Samberg, but even he couldn't save this movie
","Well I liked the flow of this movie and I think Andy Samberg is a funny guy, but the thing is this movie just isn't funny and most of the humor comes from acting awkward and trying act retarded as possible. Maybe this wasn't my type of comedy, cause I didn't laugh a single time, maybe a little chuckle than and there but that was about it. I actually really tried to enjoy this movie, but was left disappointed. Just about some guy than wants to be a dare devil who is a grown man but acts like a 6 yr old and most of the humor comes from the fact that he acts like a 6 yr old. Just about everything about this was predictable and it just wasn't satisfying. Not one of the worst comedies I seen, but that ain't saying much either.3.7/10",3,4,12,22 April 2010
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The beginning of a epic fantasy journey
","This is probably one of the most mesmerizing and epic movie I have ever seen. And it's just the beginning of this epic trilogy. This has got to be one of the best trilogy I have ever seen. Peter Jackson did a amazing job with the adaptation from a classic book to the big screen. I don't see how anyone else would have directed this movie any better. This movie is just beautiful plain and simple, from the gorgeous landscape to the vivid and fantasy like atmosphere. I have just never seen a movie like this before and seeing in theaters when it first came out was a amazing experience. If you like movies this is a movie that most definitely shouldn't be missed. But I highly recommend anyone that watches this movie to see the extended edition most definitely. It has important bits that was missing from when it was released in theaters. Which is mostly the fellowship and bonding aspect of it all and these are really important fellowship scenes. It literally helps in understanding the characters a lot better and why the characters are the way they are. And it will help understand the future installments a lot better as well. Anyways I highly recommend anyone that want to experience this epic and amazing journey to watch the extended edition, it really does add a lot to the film. The movie is more than just about a group of warriors and villagers such as humans, hobbits, elves and dwarfs getting together to fight there way to destroy a ring of power that was created by an evil villain Sauron. Although that is the main plot there is just way more to this movie and has important messages. This story is just simply well crafted into a movie and has epic written all over it. The actors that played each character is just perfect for there role and I just couldn't think of anyone better to play those roles, the casting for this movie was just perfect. Yes, some of the main characters aren't entirely fleshed out but they all stand out in this movie and the story itself will keep the audiences occupied since it's simply engrossing. Plus they are all mostly likable and you care for these characters because they are strong characters and not just physically either. This movie is simply nothing short of a masterpiece. Yes, I know some parts were cut from the book and some scenes weren't even in the book but those added scenes was a cool idea and added many positive aspects to this film than it being negative. Those scenes are very well integrated into this epic film. Jackson and his crew achieved making a movie of this magnitude that most people thought was impossible and he did it for the two other movies in this trilogy as well. The special effects, the props they used and the set pieces are just wonderfully crafted and it really does bring Middle-earth to life. This movie is ahead of it's time although it wasn't released all that long ago and is a masterpiece of a film that should not be missed. Some of the Biblical elements was interesting to watch as well.9.3/10",Null,0,1,8 October 2011
The Matrix Revolutions," Not all that satisfying but still worth seeing
","Now the first movie in this trilogy was mind blowing. Unfortunately this is probably the weakest one in this trilogy. The build up has a lot of special effects going for it, but it just wasn't all that entertaining. The main part that actually stands out and is actually pretty darn awesome is the last 30 minutes. The final showdown between Neo and Agent Smith is memorable. Basically the whole premise of this movie is about the people of Zion preparing to stand their ground against the machines that found their location and is now ready to invade. And Agent Smith trying to take over and rule everything and Neo doing everything he can to stop him. But it's done in a very generic manner with some lame or corny dialogues, even the sci-fi philosophical aspects seemed cheesy. This just isn't a very satisfying movie as a whole but it's still a movie worth seeing, at least for the last 30 minutes. And I really like the soundtrack to this one as well and it fits right in with the Matrix world. Again it's a movie worth seeing but since the first Matrix movie was such a awesome sci-fi movie this one just seem to fall far behind.6.4/10",6,0,1,9 April 2013
Man of Steel," One of the most popular fictional superhero of all time, gets the movie it deserves
","People complained for a long period of time that Superman movies lack much action. And now they get one with a lot of action and now the people complain because there is too much action...Oh the humanity. This one in my opinion I found to be a satisfying superhero movie and also had a craving for more when it was over for a sequel. And that is how all good or great franchises should be. Being satisfied but wanting more and Zack Snyder delivers. A lot of the audiences seem to complain that this lacks emotional elements or lack the romantic areas. Like the trailer made it seem to have, well at least the first 2. While I kinda agree with the emotional part when ti comes to the weak romantic aspect of this film. Snyder is probably building it up for the sequel. It seems Snyder really wanted this one to be a smash thus giving more chances of a sequel getting made. Plus 'Superman Returns' leaned towards the romantic side a lot and it failed when it came to the box office return. Brandon Routh did well but I liked the Henry Cavill's portrayal of Superman better, maybe because it's a bit more down to earth and because of his stature. Amy Adams is alright as Lois Lane, although I thought her be cast for the role at first one a mistake. Russell Crowe is great as Jor-El and nailed it as this charismatic and cool biological father of Superman. Kevin Costner is Superman's father on earth and he didn't seem to be in this movie much, except to build up Kal-El to who he becomes. Which is basically the main aspect of his character in the comics but just wanted a bit more out of the guy. Lastly Zod is played by Michael Shannon who despite his figure, I just didn't find the actor to be all that intimidating as a villain in a lot of the movies he is in. But he really gets into it in this one and throws in a lot of effort, which does make quite a change. Although Zod is poorly developed, even for a villain in this. The visuals are just topnotch and awesome. And despite the decent intro and build up, the action is what makes this movie stand out. Superman fights like how he should and it's freaking awesome. When the action kicks off, it really doesn't stop until the very end. And personally, I am not complaining. The fights, especially when it comes to Superman vs. Zod. It's legendary and so grand scale. I think it's bigger than the final fight in 'The Avengers'. In fact it's probably the most epic superhero fight I have ever seen. I really don't know how they are going to top this one for the sequel. Overall this is one of the best movies of the summer where even the final scene alone is worth the price of admission.8.4/10",8,6,10,9 July 2013
28 Weeks Later," A solid zombie sequel
","I really liked the theme song to the first one and actually enjoyed it constantly being played throughout this whole movie. Anyways this is a solid sequel to the first one. If you thought the first one lacked zombie action well you will get plenty of that in this one. The feeling of being alone and helpless isn't shown all that much in this one since there is more survivors and the people with guns are the good guys. But it sure is a entertaining zombie movie throughout. Although the intro to this movie is memorable and well done, what got a bit irritating is how the zombie chaos happens again. And this is after the start of the reconstruction of Britain after the first movie. When I first saw this movie in theater I just wanted to scream 'so are you happy now!'. Not just that the way the virus spreads is irritating and absurd. But your just going to have to go with it or it will irritate you throughout the whole movie. Especially since almost the first hour of this movie shows how the virus starts up again. I saw Jeremy Renner for the first time and liked the guy as an actor right of the bat when I saw this in theater. He plays a likable, courageous and charismatic soldier in this. Robert Carlyle and Idris Elba is good in this as well...Well the amount they are in it. The grainy and grimy camera-work returns and this time more shaky than ever. Which I would complain sometimes but it really works in this movie. Although I got noxious a few times and dizzy while watching this in theater. There is humanity in this but it also has believable emotions going for it as well. Sure there are some plot holes and stuff just obviously doesn't make any sense compared to the first movie. Sure the script could have been polished up a bit but overall as a whole it's forgivable and it's a very watchable and entertaining zombie flick that shouldn't be missed.8/10",8,1,1,24 February 2012
The Thing," A awesome sci-fi horror movie from 1982 that left it's mark and it still holds up today
","This is probably John Carpenter at his best, in another words this is a pretty good movie. And a movie that is just great to watch on Halloween night. I especially liked the theme song for this movie, it isn't anything grand but the beat is iconic. This movie left a great enough impact for there to be a prequel and a video game which is suppose to be a sequel. This isn't one the scariest movie I have seen but the tension and especially the paranoia between the characters is really high. And that is one of the main thing that drives this movie, how the characters can't trust each other which makes working together to fight The Thing a difficult challenge. This movie even stands out even now, but I can really see why this movie left a big impact in the the movie industry for it's time. I mean if I seen this movie back than I would have been blown away. Also there is little to no CGI in this which is a plus since it makes the situation a bit more creepy and it also has authentic feel to it in other areas. The special effect was just amazing for it's time and to some degree still works today without looking too fake. Overall this is a well made sci-fi horror movie that still holds up today.8.2/10",Null,0,1,31 October 2011
The Village," The fall of M. Night Shyamalan
","Now this isn't one of those movies that is uber awful like some of the reviewers are claiming it to be, but it isn't a good one either. And this is basically what started the bashing of M. Night Shyamalan, when he was praised for the most part for his past movies. He really started to push the twist thing a bit too far in a dull and negative way in this, and after finding out the twist I really wished I didn't know the twist. Even the characters in this movie is really awkward at times, but I guess it has a purpose. I really disliked the twist in this and personally I could tell what was going on a mile away, it was pretty obvious and nothing about it was really shocking or gripping. It wasn't even that suspenseful or scary at all what so ever. Overall it isn't a terrible movie, but if your looking for a good twist or suspense this one just isn't it.5.3/10",5,1,3,25 December 2010
21," Didn't beat my expectations
","This is a movie about counting cards is about trying to beat the system in gambling. And revolves around students that go to MIT, and the character Kevin Spacey plays tries to recruit some brilliant math students to join his crew and beat the system and Kevin Spacey does what Kevin Spacey does best. Although I like gambling movies this movie isn't about gambling but beating the system, and the conflict that comes with trying to beat the system. Cause some other intelligent character Laurence Fishburne is trying to catch them red handed. I didn't find anything surprising about this movie, it was just clichÃ© on top of clichÃ©. Although this movie had some flare, but it ran like a fairy tale and that sort of disappointed me, and the MIT students just wasn't that smart in this movie. '21' entertained me the first time I saw it, but it also didn't pull any surprises. The characters weren't even interesting, except maybe Choi the character Aaron Yoo played. Probably won't watch this film again.7/10",7,0,1,10 October 2009
The Revenant," More for the experience over the plot
","This is a film that is more about the experience over the plot. So if you are looking for a film with a plot that really sticks out you might be disappointed. What this is, is a survival/revenge film with the core being driven by revenge but most of the screen-time is a man trying to survive in a cold wilderness. When it comes to the cinematography though, there is a lot of effort and risk that went with it. There is quite a bit of one long takes that is just mesmerizing sometimes to sit through. It's like watching art on screen unfold. The scenery when it comes to the wilderness, sparkling lake, the encompassing trees full of color, and even the quietness of certain scenes can really draw in the viewers. The lake, frozen over, disguised itself as a white valley, as if I would be able to walk on water. It was one of the best camera- work I have seen when capturing the frozen woods and mountainous areas. The hallucinations and dream like sequences adds to the artistic aspect of this film. It's like watching a captivating and engaging mainstream high budget artistic film on screen. At least when it comes to the cinematography although it lacks in the story section of it all. Leonardo DiCaprio seems to be doing everything he can to win that Oscar. And this movie is like the perfect set up for that. He gets the chance to show off just about every acting chops in his arsenal. Tom Hardy did a fine job of bringing about his character's accent while also playing a cold and yet believable character. His dialogue at least makes him understandable to a certain degree. Overall, this is not a plot driven film but it's more for the experience. I personally haven't seen anything like this before. It's not a film I would immediately go out of my way to watch again. But it's a highly worth at least one watch.7.9/10",7,9,17,10 January 2016
Trouble with the Curve," Nothing much that makes it stand out besides it having Clint Eastwood in it
","Yeah, it has Clint Eastwood in it in the trailer so I thought he directed this movie as well. But he is not in the director seat this time but is the main protagonist in this. It's a watchable movie but far from being great as Clint Eastwood's past movie or the one's he directed. I can't really think of anything that remotely made this movie stand out all that much besides it having Clint Eastwood in it. The movie is about recruiting baseball players and the relationship between other characters. But it doesn't seem to focus on baseball all that much or how the recruiting process works and when it came to the character relationship development. It's done in a very clichÃ© and generic manner and is easily forgettable. Justin Timberlake's character didn't even have to be in this movie. His character didn't really add anything to the movie nor take away anything. I didn't like how they incorporate how a person's brain and heart can beat any calculations from a machine kinda deal. When it comes to these types of movies I recommend 'Moneyball' over this. This one just seemed a bit too generic, clichÃ© even when it came to the acting and dialogues and drags at times.5.8/10",5,0,1,25 March 2013
Bridge of Spies," Well worth a watch
","So this is a talking movie, with a LOT of talking going around without much action. Actually there is almost no action at all. So if you are looking forward to watching a action movie with spies going on espionage and trying to assassinate people, this isn't that kind of movie. When it comes to talking movies, the story, the dialogue and the performances has to take center stage. And this movie has all three of those elements without it going to a very convoluted and overly political direction. So most mainstream audiences will understand what is going on, on screen. However for me, what made this movie really work is Steven Spielberg classic direction. Where the premise is uplifting while having a sense of humanity. The cinematography really does have the tenacity to keep audiences like me focused for the most part. This is a historical film that is based on a true story. So the plot is about James B. Donovan played by Tom Hanks who is a lawyer that takes on the task of defending a soviet spy. And the negotiation and what goes behind the scenes of the American and Soviet politics. It delves into humanity and the will power to stand up for what is right, although a lot of people will resent you for it. Although this isn't a movie I would sit through the whole thing again, it was well worth the watch.8/10",8,1,1,26 June 2016
Pitch Black," The start of a inconic movie anti-hero
","This is a cool sci-fi flick that still holds up today, despite the slight corniness. The main standout aspect of this movie is of course the introduction of a iconic badass anti-hero named Riddick. This film has two stages. The first is when the ship crash lands on a planet with creatures that are afraid of the light. And Riddick escapes from the ship and everyone is on a manhunt for Riddick. The main disappointment with this, is the fact that Riddick gets caught easily. Especially when most of the people in the ship are tourist. The second stage is Riddick and the crew trying the survive and get off the planet. Few parts seem underdeveloped but overall this is a cool and fun sci-fi flick. Thanks to a dangerous, formidable and interesting anti-hero Riddick. Riddick is this stealthy badass ninja like character that can see in the dark. And a lot of the interest comes from not being sure the level of his conscience. This is Vin Diesel's first iconic movie character for a reason, and Vin nails it. To be honest I wouldn't be shocked if the makers of Kratos from 'God of War' was inspired by the character Riddick when designing the game.7.4/10",7,0,2,2 October 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," The build up for the insane magic battle, the most complex in the franchise and yet mesmerizing
","Part 1 of 'Deathly Hallows' is basically a build up for the final insane magical battle in part 2. I don't know if this is because it's close to this franchise ending, but I found the build up in this to be exciting and also entertaining. The cinematography and acting is the best by far in this series. Even if this is a build up for part 2 it still has a lot of action in it, so part 2 is gonna be action packed with magic. This is the most mature Harry Potter movie and has a lot of dark tone to it for the better. Overall it's a well directed movie that got my attention almost all the way through, the set pieces, the direction and everything else was just mesmerizing. This is a engaging build up that is worth seeing even if your not really a fan of the Harry Potter books. I suggest watching the previous 6 movies although some maybe painful to sit through for some.

Cold Mountain," Cold romance
",Stories about two lovers being separated because of a certain dire situation has happened many times in books and movies. But this one is a cold and compelling story shown in a dark manner but still has heart and warmth to it. Despite the fact that the two main leads or lovers has to go through a lot of cold obstacles and temptations in order to meet one anther again. When they are separated because of the civil war. This is not a war movie but the journey of two lovers and the surroundings they must overcome to be with one another. The male lead is played by Jude Law who plays a character named Inman that is forced to fight for the confederates but don't believe in the cause. While Nicole Kidman is the female lead named Ada and comes from a well off family because of her father. But when her father passes away and she gets put in a dire situation she has to fend for herself. Until Ruby Thewes gets in her life and is my favorite character in this movie thanks to the script and a outstanding performance by RenÃ©e Zellweger. This movie has quite a cast and all the actors and actresses puts on some memorable performances even if some of them hardly has many scenes. This movie starts out kinda slow but as it progresses it becomes more and more compelling and a bit haunting because of the realistic and well told story direction. And because of the realism and the struggles of the two lovers to be with one another becomes strong to the point I felt they really earned it. And actually cared if they end up with one another or not. This movie is a bit depressing so it isn't one I would watch again. But movies like this really bring back the old school feel and is a good effort.8.2/10,8,1,2,19 July 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," Awesome CGI animated sequel with superb kung-fu fighting that is very entertaining to watch
","This is probably one of my favorite CGI animated film. It is very close to being good as the original. The story just wasn't as gripping as the original and the development of the characters wasn't as good. But what this sequel does have is way better action, in fact it has more action than the previous movie. Watching this movie was like watching a Americanized CGI anime or something. The build up isn't as great this time, it's okay but not great. But when the action kicks in, you just can't help but be amazed at how creative and entertaining the action sequences are. The main flaw of this movie is the pacing, it just seems kinda off but that is only a very small complaint. This is a movie that kids and adults will enjoy while watching. I had a blast seeing all the awesome fight sequences. This really felt like a legit kung-fu flick that kids can watch and have a blast with. Right after the movie was over I wanted to watch it again to see the action sequences all over again. Yeah some people judge a movie by the plot the most, the plot here is okay. But c'mon it's a CGI animated kung-fu flick and for a kung-fu flick this movie was awesome. I highly recommend anyone that like fighting movies or even CGI animated movies to check this movie out. It's worth the time to see it.8.4/10",Null,0,1,4 August 2011
Little Miss Sunshine," Sweet and heart warming comedy that just about anyone can enjoy
","I didn't get what I was expecting out of this film but what I got was a enjoyable road movie. It's basically about trying to take Olive Hoover played by Abigail Breslin to a Little Miss Sunshine pageant and the scenes to get there was very fun with it's smart jokes and witty dialogue. The actors that stood out the most was Steve Carell who was great in his role and fit perfectly and Paul Dano who usually just comes off as being depressing was actually quite entertaining to watch, even though he was throwing a lot of hissy fit. There is no big plot twist but what you do get is some stuff you won't expect and will have a lot of fun with it. At first when the film started I thought I was just in for another indie comedy, but it was so much more than that with elaborate ways the characters get closer with one another and the comedy is also a bit dark which works just fine and never turns from it message. It was like a excellent comedy about the little engine that could.8.5/10",8,2,4,17 October 2009
Knowing," Adamn and Eve with Aliens
","The movie opens up in 1959 where these elementary student put a time capsule in the ground with one of the student who has this paper with numbers buried with it. And we cut about 50 yrs later the character played by Nicholas Cage finds the paper with the numbers after his son brings it back from the time capsule the elementary school decide to dig up. Than he finds out the number means something and goes about researching about it. It was just a boring film although the start is okay and you think the film with be more complex and deep but you will be very very disappointed. The couple of accidents that happen throughout was good with okay special effects but besides that the premise of the movie was crap. Maybe I expected too much cause Alex Proyas directed some great movies that I thoroughly enjoyed although he did the best he can with some crap material.Read if you have seen the movie ***Spoilers below*** This film had potential cause the beginning was somewhat gripping. Than it just starts to get predictable, except maybe the ending cause I just didn't expect it to be shamefully ridiculous during the third act. It has to do with aliens and biblical stuff with the Garden of Eden, it's a mix of bible and Scientology. Basically the message is we screwed up the earth and only the chosen shall live on while the rest are pretty much screwed. What starts off as a decent science fiction film goes terribly wrong basically cause they needed a better screenwriter. Even for what starts out as something that is supernatural it's just unbelievable and plain down right bull crap. And at the end, when you see people stomping all over other to get what they want and even looting, you just feel the human race had it coming.4.2/10",4,1,3,20 October 2009
Coriolanus," A man driven by pride alone...
","This movie is Ralph Fiennes trying to interpret and portray a Shakespeare's play 'Coriolanus' in a modernized form. Where the background and everything is modernized except the dialogue and the story which takes place in Rome although it isn't Rome. You will know what I mean when you watch the movie. It sorta seemed like 'Romeo and Juliet' the Leonardo Dicaprio version where everything is in modern setting, except the story and dialogue. Audiences that aren't familiar with Shakespeare's dialogue or have difficult time understanding some of it. There really isn't anything to worry about since the story is pretty easy to follow. Even if you can't get a grasp of what everyone is saying. There is some aspects of this movie that doesn't make sense which can be understandable since this is a reiteration of a Shakespeare's play. But it can bug some audiences that wants a realistic modern interpretation of a Shakespeare's play. Ralph Fiennes did a excellent job portraying the epitome of a man that is prideful, arrogant and stubborn that value pride more than life. A man named Caius Martius Coriolanus. And Gerard Butler was exquisite as his rival and enemy in war, that has a aura of charisma ad yet mystery behind him. Anyways I respect how Ralph tried to stay close with Shakespeare's story but it would have been nice if there was something more interesting or Ralph's own artistic vision into it. Not a lot but maybe a bit of it that might make this movie more engaging. Sure Shakespeare's works is known to be artistic but something more for the modern audiences would have been cool. This is a pretty good interpretation of a modernized style of Shakespeare's play but it didn't seem like it was amazing or anything like that to the point it sticks with you.6.4/10",6,1,5,8 October 2012
Hugo," Visually amazing but has it's flaws
","This is a movie intentionally made for kids and the whole family, but to some degree it's disappointing. Adults can sit through this movie but for kids, it just doesn't seem that enjoyable for them. This movie is directed by Martin Scorsese and it shows because the cinematography the editing is just amazingly done, although it seems a bit too long. But it sort of lacks in the story department and for a Scorsese movie the dialogue isn't all that great. Which is a shame cause Scorsese is made movies that are really character and story driven in the past. I am not sure if it's because he can't pull of the same feats that he can do with adult movies, but this one lacks in that. Sure the whole family can enjoy this movie but it's something so much more that it can't really be generalized like that even with the flaws. In some aspects the movie seemed to lean more for the adult audiences to the point I can see why the kids might get bored watching this sometimes. But what this is, is a vivid and refreshing fairytale that is intriguing and even a bit riveting most of the way through. The movie takes a while to understand what is going on though but the way it shows piece by piece of the story is very well done, although there isn't a lot of meat in the story. But everything else is just wonderful to watch, especially the town and the environment this movie takes place in, is almost dream like. This is a very well crafted fable experience for just about anyone that should not be missed. But might disappoint if your looking for a very good character driven movie with a amazing plot. The movie can also get a bit tedious sometimes but it did brought back a bit of the nostalgic feel from back in elementary school during story time. Since it's a Martin Scorsese film and judging by the advertisement this seemed like it's going to be a epic magical super amazing adventure which this is not. The build up sort of drags and doesn't lead to something super exciting, but the story isn't way too bad, just nothing special. Especially since for most audience, they won't know what the main story is about for over an hour, which is pretty bad since it's for kids as well. But it's far from being a bad movie and it really is worthwhile movie that is really worth seeing it with the whole family. In another words it's sort of a visceral experience, except leaning more to the visual elements than emotions. It's a good movie but if the environment was used more effectively for the plot it would have been better. So overall, disappointing yes, but still watchable.6/10",6,2,3,13 March 2012
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Not as groundbreaking as the 2nd one, but still passable
","This is a decent movie, but since the previous two movies in this franchise are amazing. This movie just comes off a bit mediocre for the most part, but it still has entertainment value. It might have been better if James Cameron directed this one as well, but it's still a passable movie in the franchise. The plot of this movie is basically about how John Connor starts to become the leader the previous movies talked while building a relation with a girl, although the alteration doesn't really get completed. Even if this isn't a groundbreaking movie like the 2nd movie in the franchise and is a bit shorter, it doesn't try to be something it's not. The pacing is pretty fast and the action sequences are entertaining to watch. The movie however lack the gritty and suspenseful aspects from the previous movies and comes off a bit too silly at times. The connection between the two previous movies is done pretty well and is far from being a bad movie. It just isn't as great or good as the previous 2 movies in the franchise. Just don't expect too much after watching T2 or you might be disappointed. However the main negative aspect is how this movie doesn't seem all that legit and looked a bit cheap despite the big budget that went into this. Arnold is good with this role as before, but the guy that played John Connor sorta sucked and didn't fit the image of the leader of the resistance.7.6/10",7,0,2,8 May 2011
The Orphanage," Dream like ghost story that is beautiful and suspenseful
","'The Orphanage' is a chilling film that is beautiful but yet haunting and sad. The story is about Laura and her family returning to the orphanage where she grew up and reopens it for handicap children and everything is going well in till she find her son talking to people that Laura cannot see. While watching this film it was like I was in a dream cause of the atmosphere and camera work, the setting was just perfect. The story is really creepy which starts out kinda slow but builds your tension little by little and it really isn't about those jump scares either. The story makes the audience delve further and further with it's turn of events that are actually quite original. Sound and music work very well too, the film also melds a lot of elements together in a clever and successful manner. This is a horror film that just about any girls and guys can enjoy, it's just a wonderfully crafted ghost story that is also suspenseful. It was creepy and satisfying.8.6/10",8,1,2,20 October 2009
"I, Robot"," A very mediocre sci-fi movie dealing with robots, could have been better
","This is a pretty bleak sci-fi movie. Yeah, it does have some entertainment value but overall it just isn't a great movie. The movie goes in a direction where it feels like your watching a real live cartoon than a actual sci-fi with a interesting premise. Everything about it just seemed too far-fetched and not because of the robots but how everything is portrayed in the future 2035. It just one of those movies you just have to go with despite it being a sci-fi movie you can't really buy into. The scenarios and situations just seem lame for a movie that is made in 2004. The dialogue and everything else just seemed a bit childish for a movie like this. If it went in a more intelligent and clever route the movie would have been a whole lot better. The CGI is also pretty bad, for it's budget it could have really done better in that area as well. And the main protagonist goes by the name of Spooner...Seriously Spooner? I like some Will Smith movies but you can't take his character seriously at all. He is suppose to be a detective but he dresses, walks and talks like a wannabe thug. They also really needed to polish on the dialogue cause not only is it bad, it isn't believable. So yeah like I said it's a movie you have to try a bit to just go with it. Now I liked few of Alex Proyas few movies in the past but this ain't really one of them. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a terrible movie and it does have it's moments although few. But a more better script and believable characters would have made this movie much better. The story revolves around the reason behind the murders that connects with robots. And it's up to one man to find out that reason. I gotta admit though, the movie does have a message but I just found that to be plain stupid or maybe it's just the way it was delivered. The movie had potential but it just simply faltered, I can see little kids eating this movie up though.6.4/10",Null,1,2,7 November 2011
Warrior," Finally a legit MMA movie that is taken as a sport seriously
","This is a very well made sports movie. It's the first MMA movie where it's legit and MMA is actually taken as a serious sport instead of just wannabe's fighting for whatever reasons. The premise to this movie has been done before, in fact it reminded me of 'Crying Fist' while watching although the scenario is different. But they are both uplifting movies and this movie grabs you in a emotional level few times. Some people say that there wasn't enough fighting in this, but I personally thought it had a good amount of it. And the fight sequences are very well done, it's entertaining and engaging to watch. In fact some fights makes you want to get up and cheer. And not just because you end up caring for the characters and this is a very character driven movie. Some scenes just seemed lame though and not believable at all and could have been cut short or cut out entirely, but that is just a small complaint. The performances is probably the best thing about this movie next to the fights. Tom Hardy played his role well as a character that is hurt and damaged because of his past, the guy is a beast in this movie. The main flaw of this movie is the pacing and the development, some stuff just didn't seemed developed all that well. Despite that this is a movie that is worth seeing, especially audiences that are fans of MMA or any other sports.7.8/10",Null,1,5,20 September 2011
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The definition of how a sequel should be done! A sci-fi/action masterpiece that is superior to the original
","In the first 'The Terminator' movie The Terminator(Arnold Schwarzenegger) did the chasing and hunting for it's target. Well this time the roles have been reversed but it's still more exciting and thrilling than the original. This is almost a flawless sequel and the definition of a sequel done right. This most is most definitely a sci-fi masterpiece that is engaging and highly entertaining from beginning to end. The plot is very well written and it's very memorable, especially some of the quotes. There is almost no flaw to this movie and will stick with audiences for a very long time. Definitely worth seeing to anyone that enjoy watching movies should most definitely check this movie out. The villain this time around T-1000(Robert Patrick) is very intimidating and scary at times, in another words he is a great villain even if the T-1000 is silent most of the time. I remember seeing this film a long time ago during my childhood and it stuck with me. Without giving much away, I will end this review by saying it's a sci-fi masterpiece and anyone would be missing out big time if they don't see this movie.9/10",9,3,4,8 May 2011
Salt," What could have been 'Black Widow' the movie
","I am glad Angelina Jolie took the main role as Evelyn Salt, instead of Tom Cruise taking the main role thanks to his busy schedule. The script was written for Tom Cruise at first thought until he had to step down from the role. Although the movie as a whole is slightly above average, Angelina Jolie did a great job playing a badass heroine. And it's sort of refreshing to see a badass heroine in theaters. Not all of the plot holes gets patched up at the end and it's starts from somewhat of a believable movie and from than on it's gets sillier and sillier. But the main reason I go to the movies, is to be entertained and watching a badass heroine kick ass was quite fun to watch, although I think they should have went with the silly approach from the beginning instead of trying to make it believable. Especially the action scenes were just dumb at times, but as a whole the film is forgivable because the way the plot is connected with the action scenes is engaging enough. If your one of those viewers that nit pick everything that ain't realistic in these types of film than you probably won't enjoy it as much, but if you just take it for what it is. It might be a entertaining ride. I personally thought it was a pretty entertaining action flick. Some of the characters decisions doesn't make much sense and that includes few of the action sequences as well. When it comes to the plot of this movie. It could have easily been Marvel's 'Black Widow' movie. Maybe it's because they couldn't get the rights for the character or maybe they just didn't have the budget to get the rights for Black Widow. Overall, it's a okay rental but it's also easily forgettable action movie. 7.3/10",7,1,4,6 August 2010
We're the Millers," Entertaining and somewhat funny bonding movie
","This movie is just crude, rude, crazy, dense and funny. So the plot is about a drug dealer that goes around selling pot to people as long as they are the right age. That gets put in a troublesome situation, so must go to Mexico and bring back a huge amount of pot to the person he owes money to. So the drug dealer comes up with a idea to fake and just pose as being a good white family that is just taking a vacation to Mexico. Thus bribes people to go on this journey along with him. And the group is composed of the drug dealer, the stripper, the good natured virgin and a runaway. The movie has few unnecessary moments, but it doesn't take away from the whole experience. It's a bonding movie that goes in a messed up direction. But it's still humorous, although some parts where emotions comes into play might be a bit forced at times. But it's still well done for a movie of this type. When it comes to the emotional parts, since it's a bonding comedy it's characters going through longing and belonging. The drug dealer guy however somewhat reminded me of a older Shia LaBeouf. And Jennifer Aniston is still hot. Kenny(Will Poulter) who is the good natured virgin is probably one of the best part about this movie. And Emma Roberts is alright, she is fine for the role. All the lead characters have their annoying moments, but parts that make them likable as well. Which is fine since it brings out the goods and the flaws of people. This isn't one of the most hilarious comedies I seen. However I did find myself enjoying this movie and felt I at least got my money's worth.7.6/10",7,1,3,29 August 2013
Apocalypse Now," Imaginative and deep look into the Vietnam war and the indoctrination of evil.
","This is a very interesting, dark and somewhat surreal look into the Vietnam war. It's a intense and deep movie with a lot of imagery that shows the evil side of men. This was a very very difficult movie to produce and direct because of many different set backs, budget constraints and conditions. Marlon Brando's condition was one of them, because he was a difficult actor to work with. Despite his excellent portrayal of Colonel Walter E. Kurtz. The plot is about Captain Benjamin L. Willard(Martin Sheen) who has his share of seeing the dark side of humanity, horror and evil getting sent off on a mission to find and track down and eliminate Kurtz for unspecified reasons. For Willard, Kurtz is someone that he secretly has somewhat of a respect for and to a certain extent understand where Kurtz is coming from. In another words Kurtz is someone that resonated with Willard. It's actually very clear where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas for the first 'Metal Gear' video games. When it comes to a soldier who is facing his own demons and longing for war trying to track down and eliminate a legendary soldier. When it comes to this films portrayal and mentality of most soldiers during the Vietnam war, it is shown for what it was instead of glorifying it. It delves into the inner persona of the soldiers during the Vietnam war and how to some of them it was just a big game. Maybe to show how seeing so much death and carnage can numb the human conscienceness. As a matter of fact the more Willard and his group delve into the jungle the more he experiences dehumanization. And how some people may play nice to hide the evil within their hearts. This is a very ambitious, ambiguous and masterful film that really immerses the audiences into the indoctrination of evil on screen because of war.10/10",10,1,5,7 January 2017
The Patriot," Distorted history of heroes and villains
","Everything about this movie seemed like something from Disney would make, despite the violence. And it would be forgivable if it was made by Disney, but it's not. There is just way too much Hollywood in this, yeah it's a patriotic movie and probably will make the audience proud to be American. This is a very distorted historical movie in order to make everything seem more entertaining, and isn't one of those films that should be shown in history classes. Mel Gibson seems to love these types of roles, but he really isn't a great actor and it really shows he is acting. This is film is basically black and white, where it shows heroes to be heroes and villains to be villains. Nothing about this film is riveting or gripping, sure some patriotic Americans enjoy this film for what it is. Nothing is stunning about this film, although the cinematography is decent. A lot of everything that goes on this film is distorted, but what can you expect it's Roland Emmerich's film. I am a American, but was rolling my eyes a couple of times while watching this.6.1/10",6,4,7,11 September 2010
Silver Linings Playbook," Had 'potential' but...
","I am one of the viewers that enjoyed this movie and thought it's very watchable movie. But just didn't thought it was praise worthy as some of the critics are claiming it to be. This has a strong beginning and progresses on really well and had my attention most of the way through. But a little over half of this film it all just seemed too forced and just got kinda bored with it. It started out as this awkward romantic comedy movie that made me care and be interested in two main characters but it just started to become way too predictable and didn't have that intriguing and amusing psychological chemistry the beginning of this movie has. The plot is basically about two emotionally damaged and unstable people and the chemistry between the two. It has heartfelt and attention grabbing elements in this movie. Especially when it came to what the two characters are coping with and how they go around dealing with their emotional scars. Pat(Bradley Cooper) who is this guy that gets out of a mental institution, has a broken marriage and has bipolar disorder. And a Tiffany(Jennifer Lawrence) who is this girl that is going through depression and emotional scars after her husband died. And it's the awkward relationship between these two characters that drive this movie. But it just started to feel like the film goes in a direction where it tries to exploit the actor and actress in this a bit too much. This works in some movies but just didn't seem so in this one. Who knows maybe that is one of the reasons they took on these roles. Overall this is a alright watch but nothing really worth the hype over.6.8/10",6,2,4,7 May 2013
Divergent," It turned out alright
","Watching this movie was like watching 'Twilight' (except nowhere near as bad), 'The Hunger Games' (Because of government Totalitarian, 'Harry Potter' because of the class system and factions, and a bit of 'Inception. Overall this is another teenage romance movie that totally has that written by the mind of a teenage girl that fantasize a lot all over it. But this one is impressive for something that has been written by a girl in her early 20's. I could tell how this story emulates from other stories, but it has enough creativity to make it it's own. Although the 'Inception' like device that works like something along the lines of the Scarecrow fear gas concept can be a little too much. Even if it plays a big role in the story. So what this movie is, is a sci-fi dystopia romance flick about couple of teens standing up and rebelling against a over controlling government. So yeah, the premise has been done before. Especially in certain animes. This movie is directed pretty well and the cinematography is decent for a movie such as this. But I actually liked the message behind this movie, which revolves around choosing your own path and not be fearful of what others think of you. That your life is your own and others should not play a part in controlling or manipulating you. Overall, this movie was alright. I thought it was a okay watch and I don't mind seeing the sequel 'Insurgent'.6.7/10",6,1,1,25 July 2015
Ender's Game," It's a blast
","Despite the pacing and development, which could have used some work. 'Ender's Game' the movie is a highly enjoyable movie. The story is about this genius likable badass kid Ender Wiggin that joins a crew vessel full of other kid recruits. And train with them in order to save the world from another alien invasion. Now I know they couldn't fit everything from to book into this movie, who knows maybe it can be possible. And although too much of it can bore the audiences, it just needed more when it came to the development. Which made the emotional impact scenes, not as powerful. Asa Butterfield just nails it as Ender(there is a bright future for this teen in this industry), and Harrison Ford fit right in and seemed to enjoy playing Colonel Graff. I am glad Hailee Steinfeld is getting more roles, she was really good in 'True Grit'. And MoisÃ©s Arias who plays Bonzo is a great actor, he can play really different characters, although I think he is better in comedies. Just check out 'The Kings of Summer' where he steals just about every scene. When it comes to Ender Wiggin, he is the drive of this movie, not just because of the character depth and complexity. But he is just a really likable genius. You know those so called smart people or people that want to appear smart, that has major insecurities and thus needs to exploit it constantly and prove to others how much better they are compared to others? Well Ender is not that type, he just has the leadership quality and charisma that makes the crew want to follow him and I totally bought it. Overall this is a great movie that could have been superb, with better pacing and development.8/10",8,3,8,13 November 2013
Monsters vs. Aliens," Not a awful CGI animation film, but not that good either
","Almost everything about this movie was just generic and predictable and the direction it went was mostly boring at times. So the premise is the Monsters are the good guys and the Aliens are the bad guys, the idea might seem okay but overall it really isn't a satisfying movie. There isn't even a good amount of character development so I found most of the characters to be just bland. Besides them each having their own special skills they are good at. Nothing really got my attention in this and kinda found it a bit boring for the most part. Nothing was interesting and there just isn't anything new to see or even creative. It wasn't that bad but not that good either. The jokes never really work, even for kids I don't think and everything just wasn't explored enough.5.5/10",5,0,0,26 January 2011
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters," Worth seeing it at the theaters just because of the 3D and that is about it
",This is one of those movies that probably should have been a straight to DVD movie but since it has a well known actor or actress with a bit more budget so makes it into theaters. If you seen the trailer you know exactly which direction it's going to go and can predict just about everything that is going to happen. And if your a movie buff that has seen these types of movies before can guess and be right about it. There is few subplot characters that doesn't really add much to the story at all. Except one for one violent scene and the other for a sexy nude scene. But I guess that somewhat adds to something to a movie like this but very very slightly. There is quite a bit of 3D in this movie where things fly at the audiences and stuff which might be the only reason to see this movie in the theaters. Some reviewers and critics seem to compare this to 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter' but seemed more like 'Van Helsing' with Hugh Jackman. It's alright seeing it once but nothing really stands out about this movie including the action. I give it a 4 though since it rips off of one of Terry Gilliam's film 'The Brothers Grimm' too much.4/10,4,3,9,1 February 2013
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," This Fincher's take can still draw you in.
","Despite the original or the first one coming out before this 2011 version by David Fincher. And the book written by a Swedish writer and the story taking place in Sweden with Swedish actors and actresses. This one is the better version despite the leads being American and British. Because of how it's directed, the direction and the cinematography of it all. I thought it was more thrilling and exciting to sit through with scenes that escalates when it comes to the tension and suspense every second. David Fincher is really meticulous when it comes to his films, he is just really keen when it comes to details. And the cinematography and the detail of this film really drew me in. I personally thought Daniel Craig is the better Mikael Blomkvist despite him being British and not Swedish. Although some may really disagree with that opinion. Since I seen the 2009 original film before this one, I knew most of what was coming. But the detail and more realistic aspect of this film kept me engaged on this mystery regardless. The original did a better job when it came to the flow of the story though. The music really carried the tone of this film, especially when it comes to each scenario. It's very rare for the US version to be better than the original foreign film, but this one is one of the exception. Sure having a bit more resources can be a factor in this, but it's part of the film game. Just because a film has more resources doesn't make it a worse film. Although some hipsters may disagree with this. It deals with Biblical stuff not much as 'Se7en' but that might be one of the aspect that got David Fincher's attention to take on this story. Because he seems to really like delving into these mystery murder stories that has some sort of ties to something grand and can go in depth with when it comes to certain patterns or at least something that people can at least relate with and is informed about. I really liked the cast in this, but the actress Rooney Mara transformed herself for this role (check the before pictures), she was really dedicated to this project. And put on a noteworthy performance that really showed her boldness and dedication to this role. She is a pretty actress, she is still attractive in this but just differently and it's was a big transition for her. Overall this is a mystery investigation film that will intrigue first time viewer from beginning to end. 8.6/10",8,1,1,16 January 2016
Step Up 2: The Streets," Personally think it's better than the first 'Step Up'
","Personally I liked this movie a bit better than the first 'Step Up' movie. Mainly cause it focuses more on dancing than romance, although it has romance in it. The story in this one is super ridiculous and weak compared to the first film, not saying the first 'Step Up' was good or anything. None of the characters was even really memorable in this, except maybe the character Moose. It would have been a better film with the new crew that gets made has more dancing in it, in competitions. The dancing at the end of this film is actually pretty cool and is done pretty well and is entertaining to watch. Just would have been better if it had more of that stuff. The dancing outside the competition, was pretty entertaining to watch as well, it was just slick, fast and cool. Although the story is pretty weak and ridiculous for these types of flick, you can't really expect much in that department. Plus it wasn't irritating to watch or anything, it also has more dancing in it as well than the first.6.2/10",6,0,0,14 October 2010
Being John Malkovich," Intriguing and interesting
","This is one of the most unique but awkward film I have ever seen. Just about every part of this film was intriguing and Cameron Diaz screaming 'suck my dick' just kept on adding to the awkwardness in a good way. Okay so Craig(John Cusack) and Lotte Schwartz(Cameron Diaz) are old fashioned couple except Craig is a puppeteer. He soon gets a job at a odd office on 7 and a 1/2 floor and soon find a portal that leads to seeing through the eyes of John Malkovich for about 15 min and there is some odd love triangle thrown into this. This is a very imaginative film with elements of 'Alice in Wonderland' as well and just about everyone puts on a good performance. At first you may find John Cusack of being the prick but the old people especially Dr. Lester is the bigger prick in my opinion. Anyways all in all it's a creative film, every actor and actresses put on a good performance, the film is a like a breath of fresh air because of it's weird, clever and creativeness of the film.8.4/10",8,0,1,17 February 2010
The Men Who Stare at Goats," Well I liked the overall theme, it had some great ideas but can't say the same about the execution
","This movie is based on a true story, but over exaggerated and a lot of it is made up. Well supposedly there is a special section of the government that works with psychic warfare. A reporter Bob Wilton(Ewan McGregor) who is fired from his last job and is dumped by his girl friend and has a very dull life ahead of him, gets a opportunity to go on a life changing journey when he goes to Iraq and report in order to prove himself. When he stumbled onto a special forces operator, Lyn Cassady(George Clooney) and decides to get a story out of it instead of the war in Iraq. Since Lyn Cassady supposedly has the powers of a Jedi Knight and they milk this joke for everything it got. Anyways from there Lyn Cassady's past is revealed when he was still working with psychic warfare and how he was the golden boy of the trainings and operations, while they go on a wacky unknown mission in Iraq. And while this is going on Bob Wilton is trying to figure out if Lyn Cassady is being legit or not. The parts where theses supposedly psychic soldiers try to demonstrate remote viewing and the power to kill something such as hamsters and goats by just staring at it, was actually pretty hysterical to watch. Like I said before there is a lot of Jedi jokes thrown in which is funny and repetitive but didn't feel that tedious. I also liked the direction where they went with this, where it isn't sure if Lyn Cassady is a telling the truth about his powers or if he is just nuts. I am sure he was nuts in the story and most of the audiences will agree, but I liked the direction they went with this. However it just wasn't that satisfying when it was finished since it lack the edgy to it, and went the more indie style comedy and it doesn't seem like the movie knew which direction to go with either. So I liked the overall theme and had some great ideas, but can't say the same about the execution.6.9/10",6,8,17,8 November 2009
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The 5th installment that is worth the full price
","Although it's the fifth installment, it was freaking awesome. Only few franchises can keep installment fresh and entertaining. And this one does the job well. Tom Cruise constantly proves that he is one of the talented actors in this business who put all he got into his roles. The plot and action is combined very well in this. Not as much as 'Ghost Protocol', but it's still well blended. All the characters were integrated in a way where they all have a time to shine without them just being there for the sake of being there. The new female lead was fantastic in this, she brought about that almost perfect combination of feminine, sexy and badassery. When it comes to the direction of the plot, it's actually quite innovative, I can even say clever. Even the villain stands out in this. The villain is masterful, tactful and resourceful. He is probably the most matched villain against Ethan Hunt so far. Although the villain in Mission Impossible 3, was more detestable and downright sadistic. Thanks to Philip Seymour Hoffman's acting. But the actor playing the villain did a fine job brining out this emotionless and meticulous mastermind behind the operation. It does have very few moments where it seemed to drag a bit, but the blend of cleverness and humor, makes it okay. Plus most of the parts are pivotal to the story as a whole in this. Even the chase scene is topnotch and it's very exciting and exhilarating to sit through. Overall this is a movie that mixes the espionage and action. Overall this is a spectacular 5th installment in a great franchise that shouldn't be missed.8.5/10",8,1,2,31 July 2015
Spider-Man," The Marvel movie that started all
","This is a superhero movie that didn't try to get all gritty, serious and full of twist and turns to make it a engaging superhero movie. Instead it's a friendly superhero movie that is just overall fun to watch. Plus there weren't many superhero movies like this, so the audiences were just blown away watching Spidey swing around New York. Yeah, the plot is generic and the CGI is outdated in today's standards but it was a great movie when it came out. I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie and was just amazed by it. Since at that time I have never seen anything like this, despite it leaning toward the cheesy side in today's standards. Spider-Man was my favorite superhero at that time. So as a kid I was thoroughly entertained from beginning to end and wanted to see it again once it was finished. I am not sure if Tobey Maguire was the best choice for the role as Peter Parker. But he played his character as a likable and nice science nerd. Although not as snappy and taunting as Spider-Man but he was believable as a nerd with the heart of gold. This movie doesn't pull much punches, but it has enough of Spider- Man in it with a story-line that for the most part follows through. Despite it not being very accurate to the comics, it does carry on the essence of Spider-Man. I even liked the theme song, despite few very cheesy scores but the theme song by Danny Elfman is spot on.

","This wasn't a typical war movie as I expected, instead it sort of has the 'Full Metal Jacket' vibe to it. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was influenced by that movie. At the start of the movie I thought it was going to be one of those dull war movies, but it got engaging really quick. It's based off the book, a true story written by Anthony Swofford, his life brieflyï»¿ before the enlisting, while in the Marines and after and overall it's a good movie. Jake Gyllenhaal did a good job but really started to impress me as the film went along and I liked his character as the film progressed as well. Jamie Foxx put on a great performance playing Staff Sgt. Sykes, slightly reminded me of a young Denzel Washington. I personally liked Peter Sarsgaard character, although his character is a bit of a prick but he is not as obnoxious as the rest of the team and straight to the point. The first 30 minutes was intriguing for the most part than it started to kill time by showing marines goofing off and doing random stuff during their free time, but I guess it showed the bonding aspect of it all. Some people bash on this movie for not having enough action for a war movie, and I know sometimes Drill Sergeants say stuff like 'Save the drama for your mama'. But this movie is more about the drama than the action, but it's still alright since it's kinda a manly drama. Plus I liked most of the dialogue in this movie. I just wished the impact of the film was as good as the beginning of it, cause the film started to lose it's momentum as it went along. It's basically a war movie with almost no death in it or at least you won't see people dying much, but has great character development for a war movie. Even if this movie isn't really focused on the subject matter like some reviewers claim, it's definitely worth watching, especially since you can get it at walmart for like $5 bucks.7.5/10",7,1,1,1 February 2011
Shrek Forever After," Weak finish to the Shrek journey
","After the third installment that just wasn't nearly good as the first 2. Now comes a 4th installment that doesn't add much to the franchise, despite it being the final chapter in the Shrek story. There is no charm or wits to this one. It's like they rand out of ideas and now resorting to the what if scenario. They just don't show the after after forever ever after for a reason. I know it tries to delve into the reality of these stories, but this just falls flat. I was just bored with this one. It's like the failed 3rd installment, they just tried to make it up and finish the story. This is a franchise that had a strong start and just went downhill from there. It's another watchable CGI animated movie, but easily forgettable. And lacked the charm and substance to make it memorable. It's a movie worth watching to finish up the journey though, even if it ends weak. Well at least they tried to finish with at least something somewhat passable. I give this movie a 6 and that is being generous. It doesn't necessarily completely end with a whimper, but it came pretty darn close to that travesty.6/10",6,1,2,22 August 2014
Collateral," My favorite Michael Mann film
","I remember watching this for the first time at the theaters and thinking that it was a very entertaining and attention grabbing film. Watching it now, it's even better. This film is freaking suspenseful thrill ride from start to finish, and it's really entertertaining. The direction is quite fastpaced, but just about any moviegore can understand what is going on. The plot is about a hit-man named Vincent (Tom Cruise) that hires and then forces a cab driver played Jamie Foxx to go from hit location to hit location. The turmoil, havoc, interactions and discussions is not only enticing. It's intriguing, thought provoking and has depth. The discussions of fallen dreams, fears and negligence to pursue what they want to pursue. And the interaction about how people will usually stay close to their comfort zones to withold going through what they perceive as suffering and fears over seeking what they really want out of life. There is a lot of interesting existential discussion in these conversations that just about everyone has or will think about. But it's really impactful how it was discussed and shown in this film. Tom Cruise really hits the mark when it comes to playing this cold blooded, psychotic, mysterious and persistent hit-man. A character will not backdown on his mission and will see it through no matter what, unless he is dead. He is the villain of the story, but a very interesting villain overall. This is a film that I would highly recommend to anyone that enjoys suspense and action. It's probably my favorite Michael Mann film.9.8/10",9,1,3,13 August 2015
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Isn't really faithful to the book compared to the previous movies, but it's fast paced and keeps your attention for the most part
","It's a shame some aspect of the movie is missing this time around, at least a lot compared to the previous two movies. Although this movie is missing some scenes I wanted to see from the novel, but I liked the fast pacing of this movie at the same time. But being more faithful to the novel while being fast paced would have been nice. Another thing that bothered me about this movie is the fact that the original actor that played Albus Dumbledore is replaced because of the unfortunate passing away of Richard Harris. The new Dumbledore lacks a lot of aspects that Richard Harris showed while playing the head Wizard of Hogwarts. The new guy simply didn't have the soft and yet someone you should never cross thing going for him, nor did he have that certain look in his eyes that showed wisdom. Yes, for some movies that is based on a book that doesn't go EXACTLY like the book doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. But like I said those scenes would have made this movie much better in my opinion. Even if I didn't read the 3rd book in this franchise and saw this movie after watching the previous two movies. I would have thought something was missing in this movie regardless. I personally thought it could fit a lot of the parts in the book in this movie since this movie isn't close to the 3 hour mark. On a positive note though besides the fast pacing, is how this movie somewhat atones for the stuff that is missing from the book and makes it a bit more lively and actually has a bit of satire. Everything seemed slightly more sharp including the humor. Also addition of Gary Oldman is always a plus.6.9/10",6,0,0,18 July 2011
Bad Teacher," Far from being a great comedy, but got a few chuckles out of it
","This is a summer movie that I heard positive things about from people, so I was expecting a pretty darn good comedy. But that just wasn't really the case, most of the laugh just comes from how much of a bitch a person can be and it wasn't all that funny. I don't know if I said this in the past review that featured Cameron Diaz but she is getting old and she ain't none of those top class actresses over 40. So I guess she was desperate or something but I personally found it more nauseating than sexy and the audiences reactions in the theater was basically the same. Although I think she is having a midlife crisis cause she seemed to try to be sexy a bit too much while the characters in the movie constantly fall for her. Maybe that was why she took this role to try and prove to the world that she is still attractive. Actually I noticed this with a lot of aging female celebs, they always seem a bit too hard with the sex appeal when they reach mid 30's. Which might be sort of understandable because of how the music industry work and when you lose that popularity your just about finished. I don't know but she just seemed a bit too desperate. If it was Anna Faris who was in the trailer for 'What's Your Number?' before it started it might have seemed a bit different. Lucy Punch was pretty good as the psycho teacher but than again she sort of reminded me of teachers with similar character traits in the past so it was a bit nostalgic. Jason Segel is alright as the P.E. Teacher and Justin Timberlake managed to fit the role but there is plenty of actors that could have pulled off that role. This movie also didn't want to force a moral, but the moral of this movie is terrible.5.9/10",5,1,6,7 July 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," My biggest disappointment at the movies this summer
","Now I ain't a big fan of Sam Raimi's version of 'Spider-Man' it just wasn't that consistent with the comic books or even stayed all that close to the comic books all that much. This one decides to go in a more cool and realistic direction but that seemed to be the main focus of it all without much emphasis on making a entertaining movie with a better script. I liked how makers of this movie tried to modernize everything in today's standard, thus not making the movie all cheesy and stuff like Sam Raimi's version. Like for instance Peter Parker(Andrew Garfield) is a nerd like how Peter Parker is suppose to be but he isn't portrayed as one of those stereotypical nerds. Instead he is one of those quite nerds that is very quite lack confidence in many areas and always sits in the back to the point of almost never getting noticed. What was the most disappointing is how lacking it is, in character development and the bonding elements in this movie. Marc Webb's only full feature movie besides this one is '500 Days of Summer' which was a well made romance/relationship movie. But the chemistry between Peter Parker and Gwen Stacy(Emma Stone) isn't well developed. Sometimes it's just not close to being believable at all. In fact it's really inconsistent yeah it's playful but inconsistent. I kept wondering what really linked these two characters together. Even Peter Parker's bond between Uncle Ben(Martin Sheen) is just weak and not enough bonding time went into it. When the main reason why Peter Parker became Spider-Man is because of Uncle Ben. Even Peter Parker isn't all that likable in this movie, so he is going through some traumatic time in his life. But people around the world is going through so much worse. Now Spider-Man is known for being a superhero that taunts and humiliates his foes and I was expecting him to do that quite a bit in this. And wanted to laugh or at least be amused by his one liners but there isn't much of that here. Maybe it's because he is just getting use to his powers in this one, but was still sort of disappointing. When they marketed this movie to the public it tries to go in some untold secret, but there really isn't anything like that in this. Nothing that will throw the audience off in a good way or anything like that. Now I didn't like Sam Raimi's version of 'Spider-Man' all that much, it's was just so darn cheesy sometimes and doesn't connect with the comics all that much but it was still enjoyable and entertaining. Now some reviewers claim this reboot is better than all the Sam Raimi's 'Spider-Man' combined and that is a overstatement in my opinion. This is a darker cooler and more modernized version of 'Spider-Man' but it sure does have it's flaws. Now when it comes to the Spider-Man fight sequences it's really realistic, especially with the movement of Spider-Man and all. It really felt like your watching a webslinger in action sort of. The physics and movements seemed like your actually watching a guy in a suit moving although it's CGI. The fight scene with Spider-Man and The Lizard was cool and sort of reminded me of the fight in 'Ultimate Spider-Man' although that was against the Green Goblin. The casting choices is good Andrew Garfield and Emma Stone is alright although there are other actors and actresses that might have done a better job that I can think of. But Rhys Ifans was perfect for the role Dr. Curt Connors and Denis Leary was right on target with the role of Captain Stacy. Overall this isn't a terrible Spider-Man movie, much better than 'Spider-Man 3' for sure. It almost seemed like they tried to be different just for the sake of being different between the past 'Spider-Man' movies. Which is understandable, but it just seemed they were really forcing it. I really wanted to enjoy this movie, in fact Spider-Man is one of my favorite superhero but this was kinda disappointing. 'Spider-Man 2' is still the best Spider-Man movie so far.6.8/10",6,3,8,5 July 2012
The Lego Movie," Creative and entertaining!
","I know some people that compare this movie to Wreck-It Ralph. Personally I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I did for Wreck-It Ralph, but that isn't to say this movie wasn't entertaining. It's a creative movie with Lego pieces, quick, snappy and sometimes witty dialogues mixed in with pop-culture references. When it comes to the plot, it's actually quite simple but the journey makes this movie worthwhile. All the voice actors and actresses that actually have a name in the movie industry did a really good job. Like Wreck-It Ralph I liked how certain iconic characters gets thrown into the mix as well. And for the most part it connects well with the story. The climax part of this movie also elevated the score for this movie to 7.9/10 for me. Oh and I also liked the message behind this flick as well, which probably would have benefited me if I saw this movie during my childhood.7.9/10",7,1,6,20 May 2014
Aliens," Best in the quadrilogy so far...
","This has got to be one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen. It's rare to come across a superior sequel and this movie by far surpasses the original. First of all, you get to see more of the aliens, and see them go about attacking and killing humans, while the humans think of different survival tactics, which is a lot of fun to watch them go about doing. second, although the characters in the first movie were dull, in this movie they are interesting and you actually care if some of them lives or dies or at least live long enough to know them a bit more or watch them in action some more, especially the character Bill Paxton plays. The special effects are also way ahead of it's time, and made good use of it. The dialogue in the movie which is a bit corny at times, is still fun to listen to especially some of the wisecracks some of the characters dish out. This movie by far the best in the quadrilogy so far...maybe 'Alien 5' might change that which is currently in the process of being made by Ridley Scott. Anyways I highly recommend any sci-fi fans to check this film out.8.7/10",9,0,3,1 October 2009
The Fast and the Furious," The start of a franchise that revolve around cars and a big break for two actors
","This movie was a big hit when it first came out in theaters, especially with it's budget. It's actually pretty obvious why this movie was so popular, mainly because of the suped up cars with girls and some aggressive racing and bits of action. In another words this is a popcorn flick for most guys and despite the plot not being that good, it still has elements which keeps the movie from being boring or dull. It's one of those movies where it's better to shut off your brain and just accept that entertaining and yet stupid stuff happening on screen in order to have a good time with it. This is also the movie where Vin Diesel and Paul Walker got their big break, and so this movie is the biggest thing that has probably ever happened to them especially when it comes to being in the movie industry. So yeah basically to sum it up, this is a film with a passable plot but has some thrill rides to go with it. Overall the execution was well done, it's a stupid/cheesy flick and yet it's cool and entertaining. Like one of Vin's line in this movie 'You break her heart, I'll break your neck' it's lame but stands out although most of this movie is pretty cheesy for the most part.7.4/10",7,3,4,28 April 2011
Goon," UFC on ice with some good amount of humor
","While the movie 'Slap Shot' was about a hockey team trying to be goons in order to gain popularity. This movie is about a likable goon played by Seann William Scott. Now Seann William Scott is well known for playing one of those obnoxious characters that think with the dick instead of the brain all the time. In fact Ryan played by Jay Baruchel is the obnoxious character in this movie. But while the protagonist Doug 'The Thug' Glatt(Seann William Scott) might be a character that throws down when he has to but he is a very likable guy without being obnoxious. He is pretty much a nice guy that tries to stand up for whats right but when on the ice he can take a punch and dish out punishment. Glatt starts out as a bouncer and basically becomes a bodyguard on ice, this isn't necessarily a hockey movie. Cause it focuses more on the goons of hockey instead of legit hockey players. But the goon side of things is just so much fun to watch, especially how the blending of humor works with the violence on ice. Liev Schreiber is in this as Ross 'The Boss' Rhea. I thought he would either be the villain on the other team or a rival to Glatt. But it works more in the manner of two opponents on different teams that have mutual respect for each other going at it with each other with all they got. Although it's mostly near the end with the showdown with these two character. Who are basically portrayals of a hockey goon legends Tiger Williams and Doug Smith or Terry O'Reilly. There is also a love interest part of this movie that doesn't really go anywhere much but adds slightly more to the humor I guess. The only legit hockey player in this seems to be Xavier Laflamme(Marc-Andre Grondin) who is traumatized in the movie from getting owned by Ross. The flaw of this movie though is that it doesn't have much of a development. Just 3 characters are somewhat memorable, like the Asian guy on the team. It would have stood out if he used his calculating skills on ice and other players on the team did something unique on ice that made them stand out. But pretty much none of the characters on the main team stands out. But when it comes down to it almost none of the characters are really fleshed out. Also the development of the story just seem a bit too quickly paced with not enough good development. Despite few flaws this is a movie worth watching, I can't really say hockey movie but it's a fun time. If you wondered what if Happy Gilmore did become a hockey player it might have been something like this, except without the anger management. Overall it's a good comedy that lacks some development but worth a watch for sure.7.3/10",7,0,0,8 August 2012
Now You See Me," Has it's flaws but watchable and entertaining
","Now I wasn't sure I was going to like this flick after seeing the trailers. I don't know it just reminded me of the movie 'Jumper' except with teens that do magic instead of teleportation as the primary focus. And has a badass black guy that is on their trail, except instead of Samuel L. Jackson it's Morgan Freeman who is always awesome on screen whether he be the good guy or the villain. In fact he is the show stealer in this movie in my opinion, his on screen presence always absorbed me into the movie. Magic is basically the art of being quick, swift and clever enough to trick the human eyes. And maybe a bit of mind games thrown in there to divert the attention from how the trick is really done. But it can also just be an optical illusion. It's kinda like pulling off a heist in a lot of ways, except it's legal. Except in this the team is really pulling off heists. While cops on on their traile, including Morgan Freeman's character who is a magician himself. And knows just about all the tricks of the game. Although this is watchable and entertaining the main flaw is how stupid it becomes. Despite few clever moments. And it's not really all the magic aspect of this movie, things just become really dumb to the point it gets kinda irritating since it just doesn't make much sense. And the plot seems to be all over the place, I am not sure if it's to give off an illusion to make it seem more clever and intelligent than it really is. But it just didn't seem coherent. After the long build up the ending also seemed a bit rushed. Despite the flaws this is a watchable movie that is actually worth a matinÃ©e price to go see. In fact this movie got me into doing few magic tricks of my own.7.4/10",7,1,3,20 June 2013
X-Men: Days of Future Past," My favorite X-Men movie so far...
","I thought this was going to be the most action packed X-Men movie so far. With LOTS of special effects and superpowers...I was wrong. However this has the most emotionally moving story in the X-Men movie franchise so far. It delves into humanity, subconscious, emotions, hope and destiny. There is actually quite a bit of memorable moments in this movie, mainly because of the depth and development. The plot is a bit complex for me to thoroughly explain, but it's about Wolverine going back to the 1973 in order the save the mutants in the future. From sentinels that can copy and adapt other mutants powers that are used against them. Which they got the advancement from Mystique's DNA. However shouldn't it be Rogue's power? It would have been cool to see the mutants actually have a chance against the sentinels. Anyways Wolverine is once again the main main main character who goes back in time to guide the younger Professor Xavier. Kind of like how Xavier guided Wolverine. The movie is called X-Men but the story mostly focuses in on Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto and Mystique. You do see the other mutants use their powers, but it doesn't play the main key parts into this movie. My main complaint with Wolverine in this, is the fact that he doesn't have his Adamantium claws so you won't really see him tearing crap up. This movie let's say is a refreshing start to a new beginning...Maybe. My favorite part in this movie is the Quicksilver scene in the kitchen. If people actually decide to make a Flash movie, maybe the budget won't be in the TV show. So when it comes to the Flash movie, I hope it can up the coolness from that scene. Overall this is my favorite X-Men movie so far even surpassing the second installment. It really is worth checking out.8.5/10",8,5,9,29 June 2014
Captain America: Civil War," My second favorite Marvel movie so far.
","Despite this film not being bigger with more connections and wider variety of superheroes fighting a war. A war that is driven by more tension and inner turmoil in a more devastating circumstances. However I can sort of understand why it went in a direction where the superheroes pulled their punches. Because they wanted to go in a more lighthearted approach with more fun and some humor thrown in. For a title like 'Civil War' it didn't really have lot at stake although it deals with a important decision the team has to make from the inside. It seemed more like a battle than a actual war. I did like the messages behind the plot of this movie and it does have few emotional scenes, especially near the end. So when it comes to touching base with elements that make a superheroes movie fun, it did the job close to perfection. With so many superhero movies out there I wanted something new and for the most part, this was a refreshing experience with well cinematography and choreography when it comes down to the hand to hand fighting parts. I thought I was going to prefer 'BvS' over 'Civil War'. But I ended up liking both equally. I think 'Civil War' has a more integral set up when it comes to two different ideologies, perspectives that deals with politics and inner emotions colliding. And 'Civil War' has more action and hand to hand combat sequences which I enjoyed watching on screen. Plus it has my favorite interpretation of Spider-Man in it. Tobey Maguire was alright playing the role as the web slinger, but came off way too emotional and whinny at times. And came off more girly than the female leads during few scenes, despite him being a likable nerd. Don't get me started on 'Spider-Man 3'. I think Andrew Garfield did a okay job as Peter Parker, but wasn't all that likable. Peter Parker in this reminded me of a 16 year old verson of Pavel Chekov from the rebooted Star Trek movies. Except he makes witty comments and movie references to taunt his opponents like what Spidey does in the comics and animated shows. Anyways I also liked the way it portrayed the two team leaders, showing the heart and will power of Captain America despite his traumatic past and the loss of his loved ones. Also his experience with Hydra and Shield. Than there is the charismatic but broken Tony Stark who is driven by guilt and regrets. While one is a populist the other is a elitist, so it was engaging when things went down. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed 'Civil War' and I highly recommend it.9.5/10",9,2,7,7 June 2016
Saw III," A gorier sequel with a good twist
","Wow if you thought the first two 'Saw' movies were gory, it gets even more gorier and just might please some hardcore 'Saw' fans. The set up was well done and the torture devices are more hardcore this time around. But the main aspect I didn't like about the 3rd installment is how it revealed Jigsaw to be more of a prick, cause in the first two installments he was in the gray, but now it reveals he is leaning more to the dark side. But you feel a bit compassionate towards him in the end cause of Amanda, who is his accomplice. She is one evil emo junkie who is very hypocritical and that just about sums her up. So basically the only reason she survived Jigsaw's game in the first place besides the fact that the game that is set up for her was way too easy compared to other torture devices Jigsaw set up for his other victims, but Jigsaw actually plays fair and keeps his word. If he didn't Amanda's head would be in smithereens and yet she sets up her own torture devices in a way where that is not winnable. And doesn't learn her lesson, she destroys 4 lives and one of them was a female police officer named Kerry, who really didn't do anything wrong. And just lived a life where she was dead on the inside, which isn't anything comparable to Amanda who was a drug addict and gets a kick out of cutting herself. So you want Amanda's death to be gruesome as possible but she just gets shot in the neck, which was a big disappointment. After Amanda kidnaps Lynn the surgeon to fix Jigsaw. It makes Jigsaw the old fart look like he is just trying to save his own life, while most of his victims die off. But at least it led to a brain surgery on Jigsaw which was gruesome to watch and some gore fans may get a kick out of it. I will admit that some of Amanda's quotes I had to agree on, like when she says 'what you do is no different than murder' and 'She hasn't changed cause nobody changes' which proves to be true cause Amanda is still a whinny girl that cuts herself. While the scenario of Jigsaw, Amanda and Lynn is going on, it goes back and forth to the scenario of Jeff, Jeff is a father that is semi psychotic after the loss of his son and doesn't show the amount of love to his daughter that he showed for his dead son. Anyways he got kidnapped as well and has to go through 3 test and each of the test it has a person who was involved in his sons death and through these test it is shown that Jeff is no better than the people involved in his son's death. First door leads to the witness that didn't do anything during the scene of the accident, so she isn't that bad but Jeff thinks she deserves to die and when he makes up his mind to save her she freezes to death. The second door leads to the Judge that gave the killer of Jeff's son a light sentence of just six month in prison, so Jeff has a reason to be angry at the guy but he ends up saving him. Than it comes down to the final door that leads to the murderer, but during the flashback scene it shows the guy accidentally ran over Jeff's son and felt guilty about it. Also a lot of blame goes to Jeff as well for not keeping a close eye on his son, and basically it's his son's stupidity that got him killed. As a parent he didn't even bother to teach his son to look both ways before crossing the road? Besides the fact that Jeff and Lynn use to be husband and wife it really didn't show why he was chosen although it was a decent combination. But if the origins of Jigsaw that is revealed in 'Saw 4' was shown before part 3 or during it, it would have given the idea of why Jigsaw chose him, cause both there origins are somewhat similar. Although I doubt the creators of this film thought that much ahead. The first 30 min wasn't that good and felt like it was an excuse to add more gore into the movie, and also felt a bit repetitive. Also Jigsaw's moral speech about vengeance made me roll my eyes. It's one thing when a villain knows they are evil and sadistic, but Jigsaw is a man that convinces himself or thinks he is doing the right thing. And it feels like the image of Jigsaw is getting destroyed and gets weaker as a new sequel comes out and not just literally. Jeff seems to be kinda slow but he makes a really dumb decision at the end, but it was satisfying. The twist near the end about how the game mostly revolved around Amanda and how she was a contestant all along without her knowing was a nice touch as well, my only major problem about that is the fact that although While the previous 2 'Saw' movies had some hope for the victims, it isn't the case for this one. Jigsaw was all about teaching the victims a lesson about the value of life but most of the victims didn't have a chance for themselves but for someone else to make the decision for them if they should live or die. This is a worthy sequel that connects some of part 1 and 2 together, some by flashbacks and finishes off with a decent twist in the end. It's well worth a look for hardcore 'saw' fans even if it isn't engaging as part 1 and 2.7.3/10",7,0,1,28 October 2009
Ocean's Eleven," Cool, slick and entertaining
","This is a heist movie that is slick, cool and entertaining. And doesn't rely on the grittiness of the heist or the violence. But the clever and intricate way the team works together to pull off the heist. Although some parts don't seem plausible, it doesn't get to the point where it gets dumb and irritating to watch. The movie is directed by Steven Soderbergh which is why some top well known actors and actress at that time decided to be part of this movie. It may seem like it just has top actors and actresses combined to make a movie. But this movie is actually cleverly constructed with each character playing a part and crucial to the story. Well at least for a movie that has over a dozen characters in a time frame of around 2 hours. The team for the heist where they are planning to steal from not 1 but 3 casinos. Is composed of Danny Ocean who is the leader aka The Idea Man. Rusty Ryan aka The Pro or Danny's right hand man played by Brad Pitt. He sort of reminded me of Tyler Durden in this, well Tyler Durden who is trying to steal from casinos and not just fat to make soap out of. And these two are the two cool guys of the bunch. The rookie or the pick pocket guy is played by Matt Damon. And these three are like the main characters of the bunch since they are also the most well known actors on the team. The team is also composed of The Getaway, The Basher, The Bankroll, Eye in the Sky, Inside Man, Grease Man, and The High Roller. And than there is The Target, the man they are trying to steal from who is played by Andy Garcia. He plays a character named Terry Benedict, who runs the three casinos and is very good at what he does. And is one of the main conflict when it comes to pulling off the heist. I think it's kinda cool for a guy that is passionate about his job and there really isn't anything that makes him the bad guy. Besides him appearing and working like a machine. But he has Danny's wife who she is with on her own freewill and that woman is played by Julia Roberts. Yeah she was a popular actress at that time but she just didn't seem to fit this role well. Maybe it's just me since I never really found her attractive. And a really attractive woman was needed for this role and I rarely say this. But some parts I just couldn't buy into because of her. Overall this is a well crafted and slick heist movie that has some cool dialogues and is worth checking out.8/10",8,0,1,3 March 2013
The Conjuring 2," I have been waiting for a entertaining horror sequel.
","I was looking forward to a actual good horror movie for quite some time now and here comes 'The Conjuring 2'. Which is actually an effective horror movie. It isn't one of the most horrifying movie I have seen but it's is executed quite well. James Wan who has been directing horror movie after horror movie has got his formula down now. Plus for a horror movie the budget this time around is quite high for a horror movies. Thanks the success of the previous 'The Conjuring' movie. Three things that make this movie work is the imagery and how they utilize the set pieces and environments to build tension. It really brings out the horror mainly because of the creepy imagery. The second, is how it goes in a quite clever direction and execution when it comes to the twist and turns. It actually makes the audiences try to think and guess certain scenarios. And the revelations was done in a quite smart manner. The third is the acting, even the child actors managed to pull it off. Which is a key factor when it comes to a movie such as this. I am a bit numb to horror movies as this stage, but there were few parts where I was actually a bit tense. Some of the audiences reactions were just priceless. The guy next to me had his whole face covered and was sliding down on his chair while saying 'this is too scary'. Usually when it comes to horror sequels it's usually not as good as the original...But good job James Wan. The evil entity I couldn't help but think of Marilyn Manson. 8/10",8,1,4,19 June 2016
No Strings Attached," Formulaic, but a decent romantic comedy...Just a bit overrated
","The trailer of this movie didn't hype me up at all to see it immediately, but overall it's a decent romantic comedy. It's formulaic in some aspects and goes in a direction where Ashton constantly brags about his features without proof to the audience. Which might be a good thing for guys but it kinda shows why he wanted to be in this movie, because of the dialogue that hypes him up. The plot is about a guy who is looking for a relationship with the girl he likes, but the girl just wants a sex friend. Also some guy audiences might be disappointed cause it shows Ashton being more revealing than Natalie Portman, in fact there is no nude scenes for her because she is under a contract or something. Overall it's a decent comedy, not all that funny and is overrated a bit by some reviewers in my opinion, but still a decent romantic comedy...Nothing all that special. The flaw of this movie is the formulaic and very predictable direction and parts and dialogue that is just not believable at all. Also the pacing of the movie slows down after the first hour. The main positive thing about this movie is that the two characters are relateable in some aspects.6.5/10",6,1,4,20 May 2011
Tropic Thunder," What would have been a funny movie is spot on hilarious and electric cause of Robert Downey, Jr
","This movie is downright hilarious and the main highlight of this film has to be Robert Downey, Jr performance portraying a black guy when he is really white, it was just so memorable and funny. So we got 'Tropic Thunder' which is a parody of Hollywood parodying itself and a bit of a parody of some old war movies, where you get a bunch of different stereotypical actors from the Oscar nominated actors, to action star, to the comedian, to the rapper that is a wannabe actor all to make one Vietnam movie but the director just can't handle these self absorbed actors and the movie is about to be shut down and out of desperation he takes the advice of the consultant John 'Four Leaf' Tayback(Nick Nolte). Who suggest he put the actors in the real jungle environment and shoot it live and it's here where the actors cross paths with real drug gangs, but don't recognize the danger cause they think it's all part of the movie and crazy stuff happens from there on as well. This has got to be one of the funnies movies I have ever seen, and this is definitely the way to parody Hollywood cause it really works. Robert Downy, Jr brought his game to this movie and more and it is what makes this movie hysterical, with it's crude but clever humor. Now the people that find a white man acting like he is black to be insulting but that isn't the case for this film and it's just funny without it being insulting. I was in the theaters and there was quite a lot of black people and even they were laughing out loud. Every other actors in this movie was pretty funny as well, even some cameos even by Tom Cruise who plays the role of a executive producer and does a obnoxious but funny job, while acting insane, acting...maybe. This would have still been a funny comedy without Robert Downey, Jr's character but because he is in it, it makes the movie amazingly laugh out loud hysterical. This is a awesome parody movie that really works and is really worth checking out.8.2/10",8,0,2,2 November 2009
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," Ultimate geek fantasy
","After seeing this movie I just had to read all 6 volumes of the comic this movie is based on. I must say I liked the comic a bit more since the movie didn't have some of the good parts in the comic. But that is understandable and this movie really is a very good adaptation. This movie is very unique and really got the essence of the comic and the vibe as well. I heard Edgar Wright made a lot of effort and time in making this film and Bryan Lee O'Malley even pitched in and helped with certain scenes and it was worth the effort and time. I personally think to get the most out of this movie, watch this movie first before reading the comic. Although, like I said the comic seemed to be a bit better but the movie does things in a way where some of the witty dialogue and direction that isn't in the comic gives a lot of flare to this movie. Maybe it's just the slightly different approach in certain angles and parts of the film, the humor in this is done better than the comic itself. This is probably one of the best video game style movie I have ever seen and it's not even based on a real video game although that game after the movie. Edgar Wright did a fantastic job with this movie and hit the mark almost entirely. Fans of the comic this movie is based on won't be disappointed, it might even surpass most people's expectations. Sometimes pop culture references doesn't work in movies sometimes but it worked just fine in this one, especially about the way certain group of people dress, mainly hipsters. The constant things happening in the background was interesting as well, even if it was random or didn't make much sense. My favorite Ex's out of the seven Scott has to fight is the two superheroes, Superman and Captain America...Yeah it's a lame joke but those two actors was very entertaining to watch and seemed to be enjoying themselves. What is really shocking is how this movie has like seven villains in one movie but it still works really well and doesn't fall short of almost anything. I think this 2 movies might have worked better in order to get more of the stuff in the comics in movie form. Like the first movie would be called 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the World' and the second movie to end it all be called 'Scott Pilgrim vs. the Universe'. Anyways overall this is one of the best movies of 2010 and is highly worth checking out.8.6/10",8,1,5,13 March 2011
The Usual Suspects," Smart and clever mystery crime thriller
","After watching 'Reservoir Dogs' I could slightly tell the similarities between this film. Although their maybe a lot of people that may disagree, I thought it was slightly similar. This is a cool and clever, film that build suspense and interest as it goes. This is more of a mystery movie, but it's not a mystery movie where the audiences will try to piece together all the puzzle pieces. Instead it's a intricately woven mystery crime thriller that gets more interesting as it goes. Maybe because of the multilayered direction, the really well done editing and clever storytelling. So the story is told from Roger 'Verbal' Kint about what went down on the before, during the ship heist. With him and his dysfunctional and yet effective crew getting set up for a task and how they went about it. And what the motives of each of the crew members were and so on. The lighting and camera work was also really good and it felt like you were following the heist crew and following through with the process to a slight degree. Bryan Singer started making this movie at the age of 27 and to craft a clever and smart movie at that age and got the resources and cast together is one heck of a accomplishment. This movie is rightfully a cult classic.8.8/10",8,0,0,22 July 2016
Inside Out," My favorite movie of 2015
","This is a family animated movie that the whole family can thoroughly enjoy. I personally think adults will enjoy this movie more than the kids though. While movies like 'Minions' is something kids might have more fun with. Well most kids anyway...Just my opinion. I never saw the trailer to this movie before watching this movie and when I saw posters for this film. I didn't put much thought about it and thought it would be another generic kids movie. I was totally wrong, this is probably my favorite movie of 2015. It really is a brilliant animated movie that moves the inner emotions. As a matter of fact that is what this movie is about, emotions. Like how it would be like if each emotions like Joy, Sadness, Anger, Disgust and Fear had their own characteristics. Even if the two main emotions in this movie is Joy and Sadness. Because they are the ones on the journey back the the headquarters, while the other emotions tries to keep things under control. Each emotions interactions and how they work together mainly in the control room of the mind of a little girl named Riley was very creatively executed. And how they each has a role like a job in the human mind was wacky and yet fun. So yeah, it has a awesome premise and direction going for it. This movie had potential and took it to another level. The reason I think a lot of adult would really enjoy this movie, is because of the nostalgic and empathetic factors because of life experiences. Watching this movie was like a really good Dr. Seuss story come to life. It came from the creative minds of Pete Docter and Ronnie del Carmen. I felt like I was part of this movie and felt what the protagonist Riley was going through. This truly is a heartfelt movie with a lot of heart to it and it's also whimsical at the same time. I thought it was highly imaginative how they also incorporated imagination, conscious, unconscious, subconscious, memories and dreams. To put it simply, this is a film I really needed to watch. I highly recommend this movie to anyone that has emotions.10/10",10,6,32,3 August 2015
Die Hard 2," Very standard action movie
",This is basically a very standard action movie that is pretty narrow all around. The only thing that stands out is the fact that it has John McClane and has the title 'Die Hard' on it. And he is fighting real terrorists this time. The premise however is pretty dumb but this movie was made in the early 90's. Flight restriction must have been very lenient back than cause a old lady bring a taser on board the plane. 'Air Force One' the movie probably got some ideas from this flick though. This one does have it's moments but it's very few and didn't really get my attention nor was I all that entertained. It's not a bad action movie but it's just so darn generic most of the way through. Even the villains don't really stand out despite the fact that one of the actor is Robert Patrick who played T-1000 in 'Terminator 2'. Even the main villain just comes off as some sleaze ball and doesn't stand out. It connect well with the first movie when it comes to the characters but it's just a forgettable action movie.4.5/10,4,2,4,18 February 2013
Resident Evil," Not terrible, however the video games are more entertaining than this movie
","Now this doesn't have almost nothing to do with the video games it tries to adapt with. Besides the evil corporation, the same virus and zombies, it does how ever have the survival horror feel to it and has sort of the similar atmosphere as the video games. Now this film is a mess for the most part, especially the last hour of it, but it's still a entertaining mess and the pacing is well done although it seems to skip a lot of parts and scenes. The story is passable, not great though alright for a video game adaptation and although not particularly scary it has decent action scenes and zombie killings. The plot is basically about a girl named Alice who worked for the Umbrella Corporation, who gets amnesia from a chemical and gets dragged in and has to team up with a group of commandos that is trying to infiltrate a underground lab called The Hive in order to turn off the super computer called the The Red Queen that killed off the workers after a virus outbreak. But the team is in for more than they bargained for. The acting in this is pretty bad, not terrible however. And although it isn't a fantastic film, it still is entertainment to some degree. Would have been better if it had some of the video game elements of solving puzzles with more flare to it and was compact better in a way it flowed better. Has a lot of flaws and nothing about it is scary in anyway, but still decent.7/10",7,1,2,11 September 2010
Quantum of Solace," Quantum of disappointments
","This was a alright movie but the story is crap. The set pieces and everything from the action to the acting is well done but the story just didn't do it for this movie. There was some really high expectations for this movie since 'Casino Royale' is a freaking awesome movie. There was also a expectation that this would be the contender to 'The Dark Knight' well that was farthest from the truth. Unfortunately this sequel ended up being a very big disappointment and I really wanted to like this movie. Like I said some good action set pieces but even that couldn't make this a better movie. It just lacked the engaging and engrossing elements that 'Casino Royale' has. Instead it seemed like it was trying to be another 'Bourne' movie. What movies should never do is show a simple story in the most convoluted way possible. And that is what this movie does, when it comes down to it. The story isn't great and is simple, but they tried to make it seem more intelligent than it really is. Which is it's main downfall and if the action was better integrated into the story the action sequences would have had more of an impact. 5.5/10",5,1,2,20 November 2012
Independence Day," One of the first movies I saw in theater and it's a memorable one
","I have a bit of a soft-spot for this movie because this is one of the movies I remember seeing in theaters during the early stage of my life. And thoroughly enjoying, although I couldn't really grasp what the story was about entirely. Which might have been a positive thing, since seeing it now the plot is actually quite dumb. It's a feel good alien invasion movie though and entertaining. If you can get past how dumb and ridiculous the direction the story takes in this one. This is probably the first movie I saw with Will Smith in it and this is probably one of the movies in his career that kick started his career. He is badass but comedic at the same time, which he is in a lot of his movies. But the first time I saw his performance, I was enthralled by his entertaining acting chops. I subplots are irrelevant, which focuses in on 3 main characters and there female loved ones during the invasion. I thought it would have been better if the story focused more on how to fight the aliens. Even the politics and how the countries work together during that situation would have been more interesting. So yeah, this is a entertaining popcorn flick and a movie that left it's mark when it came out. In another words it's not a great, intelligent movie. But for a movie that came out during the 90's it still holds up to a degree.7.4/10",7,0,0,1 August 2013
Legends of the Fall," More corny than poetic
","When I first saw the movie poster and the actors that was involved, I was expecting a pretty good story. In that department I was disappointed, it's basically a narrow love story that is clichÃ© and very formulaic. The constant emotional or dramatic music that plays in almost every scene starts to get annoying after a while as well. The main highlight of this film is the young Brad Pitt and the makers of this movie knows this as well, and not because his character stood out or anything. But because it's the type of movie where the handsome man rides in with his horse and gets the female audiences to drool. The movie is basically about three brothers falling for the same girl and all the drama that goes with it. The story is also very slow moving and gets tedious after a while, I enjoy some romance movie but I can't really say I really enjoyed this one all that much. The pacing is awkward like some scenes were cut due to length, so I assume the book to probably be better. Some critics claim this movie is poetic, but I just found it mostly corny.5.5/10",5,33,59,31 January 2011
No Country for Old Men," Slow paced crime/thriller but highly amusing and engaging
","The Coen brothers are just good at making these slow paced crime/thriller films. They sure proved it with the movie 'Fargo' and they proved it again in this one. I just really enjoy the Coen brothers distinct trademarks and elements they put into their films and I enjoyed this one for it as well. In a way watching this film sort of reminded me of the film Chan-wook Park film 'Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance'. Not all that much when it comes to the story but the direction and vibe of it while just about entirely having it's own thing going. Maybe it's the cat and mouse aspect of this film. The Coen brothers trademark of adding slightly odd or even awkward characters in their film works this time around as well. And their choice of casting is fantastic. Especially Javier Bardem who puts on his performance of a lifetime and will probably be known for this role for a very long time. He is basically the show stealer in this film and despite the scary nature of his character I was anxious to see what his character would do next. Javier plays this hit-man that goes around killing people with a air gun to track down where the money went from a drug cartel and goes about his business in a very intimidating and menacing manner. While having some messed up sets of principles. In fact he sort of reminded me of the villain Two-Face from the Batman franchise, but that is mainly do to the coin scenes in this film. And because he is the most unrealistic character in this film when it comes to his killing spree while not putting hardly any effort to cover up his tracks. The Coen brothers trademark of adding a bit of dark, uncomfortable or awkward humor is still present in this film. Overall this is another great installment from the Coen brothers and film lovers should most definitely check this one out. The ending however is abrupt, in fact it doesn't seem to really have a ending and seemed to wrap it up after the climax a bit too quickly but that is only a small gripe. And I don't like it when the guy that has a conscious and tries to do the right thing ends up getting screwed over in a film but that maybe to add to the realism.8.6/10",8,2,2,27 April 2013
District 9," I can't believe this movie just had a budget of 30 million dollars
","I can't believe this movie just had a budget a 30 million, it could have easily been way more. This movie had it's budget used very wisely because everything is done effectively in this. The development and transformation of the protagonist is done very well and almost everything about this movie is stunning. It's a movie that deserves it's hype, in fact this is one of the best alien movies I have seen. Anyone that enjoys watching movies should most definitely check this movie out, you won't be disappointed. I sort of knew the direction this movie was going to go, but it does it in a very engaging and entertaining manner. This is almost a perfect sci-fi movie and not only is it engaging but as the movie progresses it really starts to get engaging. This really is a brilliant sci-fi flick with excellent development and has a engaging story and character to go with it. When I saw the trailer to this movie, I was expecting some good things from it but it really did beat my expectations in almost every level. The movie has slight flaws though, and something are just not answered very well like the reason why the aliens came to earth in the first place being one of them. If the background of the aliens were given a bit more than this film would have been better, also if it gave other characters some depth and establish some of the other characters as well. Overall this is a must watch film and deserves the high praise and rating it's been getting.8.9/10",8,2,9,14 March 2011
The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug," Fantastic second installment
","This movie is just about everything I ever wanted from a Hobbit film. Although it has quite a bit of elements that wasn't in the original book. I personally didn't find it to tarnish the story, and didn't take away from the whole experience. This has plenty of orcs slashing, magical powers, dwarf fights going all out, stealth, romance and dragon fighting. Oh and Legolas who wasn't mention in the book, using Elvish combat like he never used before in a film. Plus it has Evangeline Lilly as another made up character for the movie as Tauriel (who in my opinion is the most attractive female character to appear in Middle-Earth on screen). This is a fantastic movie which I thoroughly enjoyed, although the end or the climax seems to be dragged out a bit. Just about everything good about this movie is topnotch. I wouldn't mind seeing this one again. Oh and also when it comes to Legolas's dad, I thought he was a jerk until one of my friend gave me more insight on the Elvish way of life, their purpose and the way they do things. How they really have connections with Middle-Earth and how the natural environments have their backs. Anyways this is a amazing movie that is one of the top movies of 2013.9.2/10",9,7,17,17 December 2013
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Artistic western
","This is one of the films that isn't for everyone because it's a slow and yet realistic film, with a lot more talking and drama than action. It just very beautiful to watch though and the realistic approach is done very well. Some audience might be turned off by this film because for a movie about one of the most famous outlaw, there is hardly any action in it or robberies. The film is about the last days of Jesse James before his assassination and everything from the acting to the cinematography is done very well. Brad Pitt does what he does best and his acting is top notch, he was excellent in portraying Jesse James in a complex and yet charismatic manner. Casey Affleck was perfect for this role in portraying Robert Ford, his acting was very believable when trying to act all annoying and cowardly. If your one of those types that don't care for stuff blowing up every minute or constant action, you might enjoy this film. It's artistic western with great acting and amazing cinematography, showing the ending of Jesse James's career. With that said, this film is not for everyone. Most teens will probably be bored by this movie, I personally liked this film enough to give it a 8/10.8/10",8,3,4,31 January 2011
Remember the Titans," Really did exceed my expectation
","This really is a powerful and inspirational film. One of the best Disney movies I seen in a while. I should really slap myself for not watching this amazing movie sooner and just passed on it for so many years, cause it just didn't interest me. But since everyone was going on about how great of a movie this is and too my shock, they were right. Denzel Washington did a phenomenal job playing Coach Herman Boone, he is just so charismatic as always. This film makes you care for just about every character in the movie, almost the entire football team. This ain't a average high school football team, but a touching story of two race mainly focused on two men overcoming there difference thanks to the coaches in order to reach a greater goal in life, besides hatred for one another. This is a very memorable film and exceeded my expectations in every way possible. Highly recommend anyone who hasn't seen this movie to check it out. It's a feel good movie that almost gets everything right.",8,0,1,28 September 2010
Batman Begins," The legendary superhero movie trilogy begins...
","I watched 'Batman: The Animated Series' during my childhood. And that was the closest thing to a legit Batman at that time besides the comic books. Didn't like Tim Burton's version of Batman all that much, maybe adults at that time enjoyed it more than kids. I thought 'Batman Forever' was a cool movie when it first came out in theaters but watching it now, the movie is crap. And I don't even want to get started on 'Batman and Robin'. What this is, is a fresh reboot to the Batman franchise and is the first live action movie that shows the roots to how Bruce Wayne became Batman. At least of what I know of. When I first saw the trailer I had high expectations for it, and Christopher Nolan really delivered. This movie met my expectations and was very entertaining to watch how the road of the Dark Knight or the world's greatest detective. There isn't much detective aspect to this one, but it shows how batman utilizes stealth like a modern day ninja. Christian Bale is so far the best Bruce Wayne so far although Michael Keaton can arguably be the best Batman. Anyways Bale was perfect for a role of a tortured soul fighting for justice. Bale is a serious actor and Bruce Wayne/Batman is a very serious and dark character for the most part. I also like how Bruce acts like a billionaire playboy, well he is a billionaire but act like something he is not. In order to throw off suspicion that he is Batman. Unlike in 'TAS' where Bruce was also a boyscout outside of the the batsuit. Liam Neeson plays the mentor or master character really well, not only he plays badass character but he brings a sense of charisma. You can't help but buy into his character in a lot of his movie and this applies here. Although he is the one that trained Bruce Wayne they have different views on justice and justice does collide. Cillian Murphy gives wits to his character in this as Jonathan Crane/Scarecrow and give off this sense of ambition and maliciousness. Also a bit of creepiness to go with it. Even though he is just a side villain in this he does make his character at least memorable. Carmine Falcone is a despicable mob boss that basically owns Gotham and is played by Tom Wilkinson. The dialogue and the presence that is given by Tom Wilinson makes it not so far-fetched why Carmine Falcone owns Gotham. The guys has some street smarts at least when it comes to running the underworld. Katie Holmes was just okay, anyone could have played her role and she doesn't really stand out. Even though her character plays a prominent role in this and the sequel. It would have been cool if the lawyer she becomes friends with in this turns out to be Harvey Dent so it can be more coherent with the sequel. Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox brings intelligence but also seems like a character you can trust, which is a very important element despite Freeman also having one of the best movie voices. Lastly Commissioner Gordon and Gary Oldman is perfect for this role. While the past Batman movies this character was just wasted but he at least has a role in this. And it feels like the beginning of a friendship between two men fighting crime. Same with the bond between Bruce Wayne and Alfred in this, Alfred actually has some good lines this time around. Christopher Nolan decided to go in a realistic superhero direction and it really works in this. It looks like with the right training and billions of dollars you can be Batman. This movie does a excellent job of using flashbacks, even though it's used a lot in this. It just isn't distracting, props to the editing department. Although it can take up to 50 min to find out exactly what scene happened when and where in the story. The build up is so very intriguing and entertaining. The story blends right into a Batman origin story and the action although there may seem to have a bit too much cuts and out of focus sometimes and not sure of what is exactly going on. The utilizing of stealth from Batman makes it cool. But still if it was less choppy it would have been better, this ain't a comic book strip. However this movie shows that Nolan really did his research or a fan of Batman. It's awesome when a director knows what to do with a superhero based on comic books. If you like superhero movies or action movies with a great build up this one is definitely worth seeing. This is Bruce Wayne's journey of building up his symbol at it's finest.8.5/10",8,1,1,18 July 2012
The Fault in Our Stars," Not a typical teen romance film
","These days with so much emphasis being put into movies with high-tech special effects and things going boom. It's refreshing to have a chance to watch a gem of a film such as this one. Now, I am not one of those audience members that are into romance movies much (maybe during my younger days), especially teen romance movies. But I am so glad I got a chance to watch this teen romance movie. Lot of teen romance movies or dramas these days seems to go into that really sappy, pretentious, delusion direction and just misses it's mark. And seems to target the audience members that likes to eat a bucket of ice cream while watching some superficial cardboard cutouts input on what love is in order to feel that sense of sweetness in their lives (which is understandable). However this movie is like a romantic poetry on screen, this is a bold statement but I would even go as far as calling it modern day Shakespearian story work. Mainly because the story is so well written and it delves into the mindset and the core if the matter when it comes to emotions and heart. So when it comes to the story it's about 2 people dealing with cancer and the relationship between one another. You can let reality crush you and live in denial while trying to forget by means possible or you can stand and fight through and seek (and these are two characters dealing with cancers!). It also wasn't forced to get emotions our of the audiences or did it seem self-indulgent like some art house movies. Sometimes when it comes to movies like this, even the serious scenes sometimes comes off funny because of how cheesy it is, however that wasn't the case for this film. When it came to the funny parts the audiences in the theater was laughing, during the cute scenes they were all chuckling, and during the sad or serious scenes it was dead silent. That my friends is movie magic, as a matter of fact I ALMOST cried...That is a lie, I actually did cried then looked around to see I wasn't the only one in order to not go in that guilt trip. Thankfully, I wasn't the only one, but even if I was the only one, it's okay. Augustus Waters is now one of my favorite leading male character in this genre. He is just so charming, humorous, witty, knows how to use sarcasm in a non-demeaning way and above all the guy has integrity. The couple in this film was so likable, cute and the chemistry was so uplifting that I wanted to get out of my seat and root for them. Overall this is a movie that really tugs on the heartstrings and is not just another teen romance movies that Hollywood seems to be chugging out these days. If anyone including teens and even elders are looking for something to do during date night, check this film out. It will make you fall in love with movies all over again. As a matter of fact this is probably my favorite film of 2014. Oh and the soundtrack is fantastic.10/10",10,1,3,13 August 2014
Wreck-It Ralph," Probably the best CGI animated movie of 2012
",This movie is a blast from start to finish and I wouldn't mind seeing it again. When I first saw the trailer showing a CGI movie blending video game characters within video games. I thought it was a cool idea and thought it was going to be a good entertaining flick. But this turned out to be a great entertaining flick. Some reviewers compare this movie to the 'Toy Story' franchise. I can see the connection but this has enough of it's own elements to stand on it's own without it going in a really gimmicky direction. There is also a bit of emotion and heart to this movie and doesn't seem forced in. The protagonists are all likable in there own way and I couldn't help but care for all the main characters in this movie. Overall this is probably my favorite CGI animated movie of 2012. And can't wait for the sequel.9/10,9,0,3,20 November 2012
Bridesmaids," Maid of Dishonor
","I heard of positive things about this movie and the reviews seemed to be pretty good. So I had slightly high expectations for this movie, but it just didn't meet it. This is basically a overrated comedy that annoyed me than it actually being fun and entertaining. It just seemed all the characters were being obnoxious without even being funny, they are constantly wacky and not believable at all and it just doesn't work very well. It just didn't seem to know what direction this movie wanted to go so it was like all over the place at times. After a few minutes in I thought this was gonna be something similar to 'Bride Wars' which is another crappy movie but it goes in a different direction later on. Most of the characters are abnormal in this, maybe to make it comical but they really aren't all that likable. So they are not believable and yet it reminded me of one of those comedy TV shows like 'The Office' for example, except your not attached to the characters. Also sort of reminded me of those comedic movies that is cheap and not believable what so ever and tries way too hard to be funny at first. This isn't a charming comedy either and everything was just over the top without being effective. The constant bickering and arguing between one another gets annoying than actually funny, it's goofy but not funny. The movie is mostly about one of the bridesmaid falling down and feeling sorry for herself and even that wasn't done well. This isn't a terrible comedy but it's overrated for sure. Also felt the movie was way longer than it had to be.5.6/10",Null,0,0,24 September 2011
The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey," Definitely a great start to the journey
","Doesn't have as much substance compared to 'Fellowship of the Ring' but still a pretty solid movie. But 'Lord of the Rings' has 3 separate novels that make up the trilogy and three separate movies. While 'The Hobbit' is just one book so Peter Jackson probably tried to fit every detail of the book into this movie. And other written stuff by J. R. R. Tolkien. The movie starts off slow, in fact it takes quite a while before the journey takes off. But when it does kick off it becomes a entertaining adventure. But the build up is still good as well. It does a good enough job to make the viewers satisfied but crave more. Which is most definitely a positive when planning for a sequel as well. It's more action packed compared to 'Fellowship of the Ring' though. And some action scenes seems far-fetched how things play out but it's still humorous at times. The cinematography is just crystal clear as well and adds to the fantasy style. Some complain about the faster frame rate but I personally liked it and looks more likes those fantasy drawings. Gandalf is just super cool in this movie, in fact he is one of the coolest old guy in a movie ever. You know the part where the crew tries to escape from Moria while battling orcs, goblins, trolls and Balrog. And it was cool but the escape scene from inside the Misty Mountains when the Dwarfs get taken captive and Gandalf shows up. This escape scene takes it to another level. And is the highlight of this movie. Peter Jackson also did a great job of picking the cast for this movie. Like he did for the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. There is also quite a lot of CGI compared to 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy but since technology got more advanced it's just top notch. Overall this lacks substance compared to 'Fellowship of the Ring' and a bit less intriguing and it's also slow moving. But it's a movie most definitely worth checking out in 3D.8.3/10",8,1,4,7 January 2013
Before Sunset," Just two characters constantly talking...And it's great.
","What this movie basically is, is a conversation between two character, one guy and a woman talking about life in general, there dreams, society and what they faced etc...But the movie is very interesting and is just entertaining to watch two character just ramble on. The movie is believable and realistic to the point you can't help but buy into it. Although few times I felt it was actors and actresses on screen but most of the way through it felt like real people not characters having real conversations with each other. And that is one of the elements that drives this movie besides the topic of the conversations which is another key element that made this movie good. What other thing that impressed me is the long one take scenes during the conversations since if they screwed up they would have to start that whole long take over again. Sometimes it seems like it compacted a bunch of interesting thoughts about certain stuff into one movie as much as possible but for the most part it's alright. And it also didn't seem all that forced and seemed natural most of the way through to the point it felt like a improv or they winged it. Some of the stuff the characters cover some audiences might agree with and some might not, but it's still interesting conversations that you won't mind listening to. Like how sometimes you might eavesdrop into other people's conversation and be interested in it, this movie is the epitome of that. The chemistry between the two characters was also really good. The 'what if' aspect to this movie is also very well integrated into this movie. Even if this movie is about two people having conversations you will probably appreciate this movie even more the second time you watch it.8.4/10",8,0,0,22 December 2011
Non-Stop," Well it has Liam Neeson kicking ass and taking names
","This is one of those ridiculous thriller/action flick that gets even more ridiculous as it progresses. However it has Liam Neeson kicking ass and taking names. So I was in, and Neeson basically carries this movie. However this was one of those movies that seemed to just make stuff up as it goes when it comes to the plot. It's a serious toned movie that gets wacky with it's ridiculousness one too many times. Not once did I go 'wow that was actually quite clever'. However it's still a decent entertaining flick. Not really all that good, but still quite watchable thanks to Neeson. Oh and the climax was really dumb.5.9/10",5,1,2,4 May 2014
The Princess Bride," Simple and yet effective family film
","This is a simple fantastic family film, that follows the formulaic knight in shining armor saving the damsel in distress. Sure a bit more depth in the plot or if it added more materials from the book this is based on. It might have been a better movie for adults to watch as well. It's still a fun film for the whole family to sit through and enjoy and who knows. Maybe the simplistic style of this film is one of it's charms that makes it stand out from the rest. You can tell not much budget went into this, even the set pieces and costumes seemed like something out of a play. This movie starts out with the grandpa telling his grandson a fairy tale, 'The Princess Bride'. The story delves into some good messages, such as fighting for whats right, standing up for yourself, that life is not fair but you can set your own path. Cary Elwes the male lead in this, was just great. I can totally picture him playing Robin Hood or other superheroes that utilizes wits and humor. Overall this is a simple magical romantic adventure that is worth a watch.8/10",8,1,2,7 February 2016
How to Train Your Dragon 2," Some wasted ideas...
","I really enjoyed the first 'How to Train Your Dragon' and this sequel is actually pretty good, but just not good as the original. The story just wasn't as uplifting as the first one and the pacing seemed a bit off at times. A lot of parts appeared to be rushed and not developed as well. The relationship between Stoic and Hiccup was weak, yeah it had the previous movie to develop in this area. But when it came to the turn of events, I just couldn't feel much emotion...And that includes the characters that deals with it. I think it should have developed more with intriguing dialogue between the main family characters. Even the villain in my opinion was just weak and nothing is really known about him. The main villain Drago Bludvist has control over a Alpha Dragon which is a dragon that has control over other dragons. But it never mentions how he managed to do that, maybe they might mention it in the next installment. But it's bothersome when you see a movie that has so many untold aspects to the story. Besides the fact that he got scarred up by dragons in the past, Drago just seemed like a generic family movie villain. Dragon wranglers plays a part in the story and they are just their and nothing stands out about them either. It's a good movie, but it just falls short in a lot of areas. The parts that are suppose to be emotional just wasn't. Mainly because it just lacked the right elements to get me emotionally invested into the story. Now I know that it's difficult to flesh certain things out with the budget and all. But I personally thought if things WAS more fleshed out it could have had more emotional depth. Maybe they could have sacrificed certain things to help develop certain things more. I don't mean to drag things out like certain TV shows, but just the right amount would have added to the effectiveness. It's like a lot of ideas ended up getting wasted because of the direction of it all. Overall it's a good movie, but I have seen a lot better. The soundtrack is just fantastic.6.9/10",6,3,12,29 June 2014
The Pianist," Lacks a bit of character development and not as powerful as I expected it to be
","This is a well crafted movie that deserves some praise, but I still felt the film is a bit overrated. I guess it's cause I was expecting a phenomenal and amazing movie, but what I got was a pretty good movie. It just wasn't as powerful or compelling as I thought it would be. Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of WÅadysÅaw Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished. It really isn't a masterpiece like come critics claim it to be.7.8/10",7,7,12,16 February 2011
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Grand movie
","This is a whimsical and meticulously crafted film by Wes Anderson. And I thoroughly enjoyed it from start to finish. It's one of those films that you just don't want it to end. The design and cinematography of this film is just meticulously and immaculately shot. We Anderson is one of the few directors that has a lot of control over his projects and carries with him, his trademark style. All the actors did a fantastic job with their roles. They really did a great job of bringing the characters to life. I liked the tangled web of hope and disillusionment, faith and cynicism in this story. The character that stands out the most in this is of course the main protagonist Monsieur Gustave H. (Ralph Fiennes) the Grand Budapest's devoted concierge. He is huberous but a bit delirious as well, charming but a bit manipulative, controlling and fastidious character. He is vain cynical person that isn't entirely likable, but has my sympathy. In another words, he is a flawed hero in this story that has the characteristics of a quick-witted fox. I first thought most of the story will revolve around characters in a hotel and how they go about it. However it turns out this is a immaculate caper film. Overall, this is a hysterical adventure I wouldn't mind seeing again. 9/10",9,2,4,23 September 2015
The Transporter," Statham begins
","So this is the breakout movie for Jason Statham and the first movie where he plays as the lead role. I didn't much think of this actor when this film first debuted. But he really built himself up to be one of the most well known action stars out there. I remember watching this movie as a kid and thought it was alright, maybe because I was a big Jet Li fan back then. Sure this film can be slightly corny in today's standards and the chase and action sequences are ridiculous. But a movie like this shouldn't be taken seriously. And it seems to get even more ridiculous and even more over the top with each installment. So the plot is about this guy named Frank Martin who is a Ex-Special Forces Operator and topnotch driver that transports people or objects from one destination to another for a fee. Even if the task is dangerous, so in a way he is a getaway driver. He has three rules. Rule One: Never change the deal. Rule Two: No names--Frank doesn't want to know whom he's working for, or what he's transporting. Rule Three: never look in the package. The last two rules puts him at a disadvantage in my opinion, especially since he works for dangerous guys. From the dialogue to the anti-hero to bad guys interactions is very clichÃ©, but it's one of those action movies that because of the simple and yet fun action sequences. Even if the characters directions and decisions doesn't make much sense either. Mainly because it doesn't try to be more than what it is, while it having effort and well choreographed sequences in it mixed in with humor. This is a cool (although a bit corny now) and stylish action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. So overall, this movie despite the mediocre character development and story it connects well enough with the cool action sequences to make it worth a rental and made it worth a watch in the theaters when it came out.7.1/10",7,0,0,28 July 2015
Tucker and Dale vs Evil," A horror/comedy about a big misunderstand and it really really works
","This movie is most definitely a movie that should have been marketed right even if it's low budget. It's a low budget movie done right, just about everyone of the elements in this movie works. The mix of comedic and horror is blended just right. I like how the generic creepy hillbillies is the heroes this time around, well sort of. The bonding aspect of the movie is another good thing about this movie, it just seemed like they accomplished a certain tasks in a funny manner together in a way where it seemed like the characters connect with each other. In another words it's a kickass bromance flick with comedy and horror. And like I said just about every element in this movie works. I especially liked how it made fun of the stereotypical hillbilly horror flicks and the clichÃ© way it's perceived in most films and sort of made a homage of it and it's really funny. The plot in this is about two friendly hillbillies that get targeted by bunch of college students because of a big misunderstanding. I liked this hillbilly duo a lot in this movie and would look forward to seeing them work together on other projects. The moral of this movie is don't be judgmental cause it can lead to stupidity. Anyways the way it makes fun of the generic hillbilly horror movies is actually cleverly done and well crafted. To the point while watching you can't help but anxiously wait for the next punchline to come cause it really hits the spot. I really recommend anyone to watch this movie and wouldn't be shocked if it ends up as a cult classic. It's good as 'Shaun of the Dead' there I said it.8.2/10",Null,1,1,6 October 2011
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," You will have a blast with this one
","Since I really enjoyed the third installment. I was looking forward to a sequel and this one disappoint. It plays on that IMF Ethan Hunt team element perfectly. And even has a superb pacing and direction when it comes to the character interaction and action sequences. This movie just never seemed to slow down and I mean that in a good way. This time the gadgetry gets a super upgrade and plays a pivotal part in the movie. It's just a really fun, stylish and cool ride from start to finish. Sure, it goes slightly over the top, but not to the point where it seemed silly. I remember seeing this in the theater and wanting the see it again when it was finished. Even the humor works well in this, and makes the whole experience a bit lighthearted. And the humor can be a hit or a miss when it comes to an action movie. And the humor even works during the action sequences during few scenes. Which is quite an accomplishment. This is movie that just about anyone can enjoy. I personally had a blast with this one. This installment really ups the game for this franchise and it shouldn't be missed.8.8/10",8,1,2,31 July 2015
Revolutionary Road," Life happens
","This is Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet first reuniting for a film after 'Titanic' and they both give a fine performances in 'Revolutionary Road.' The story tells the lives of a young couple living in suburban Connecticut who decide to risk everything to pursue their dreams. Frank Wheeler(Leonardo DiCaprio) is comfy with his lifestyle although he hates his job, April Wheeler(Kate Winslet) is the wife that wants to escape from Revolutionary Road and has fantasies of starting somewhere else, maybe Paris. So they want to break away from the ordinary-but can they do it without breaking apart? This film is a bit over dramatized and a bit over acted while showing the life of a family living in a suburban home in 1955. Some may not like the portrayal of the suburban life in this film, cause it makes it seem like suburban hell. And many people would rather live in a suburban area over ghettos, trailer parks or no home at all where some working class neighborhood where the cops make routine visits in order to quell common disruptions cause of the danger. And how some people would rather live in suburban areas not because of superficial things but because the neighborhood they are living in might be dangerous with gang members, drug addicts and other hopeless people. Which doesn't seem to be the case for the Wheeler family. But the film did do a good job of portraying suburban life as a false, materialistic, repetitive life. So it's forgivable in my opinion, the work to live and live to work life style that's become so normal in modern society. And did a great job portraying 2 lovers who are trying to break free while knowing they are not special in anyway. Now I sort of get why this film didn't do that great in the box office. People usually go to the movies in order leave reality for a few hrs, and the film does bring back a lot of the harshness of reality. No one in this movie is portrayed better than the other, Frank and April are equally selfish and is desperate to have a taste of the fantasy life but you can't help but feel sorry for them. It really did a great job portraying the downfall of a suburban family and it shows how it's a mistake to have kids because having kids ruin the chances for a couple to be happy, which I sort of agree with while others might be happy with having children, maybe. April Wheeler look at her third unborn child as a parasite, in fact she seems to dislike her children while trying to convince herself that she still loves them, maybe a part of her does. But she smokes while pregnant and even goes as far to give herself abortion with her own hands. It really showed the realities of human nature, like even if they smile at you and act all friendly they should not be trusted cause they will gossip when you have your back turned or dead. It even portrays the Wheeler's marriage ending up being nothing but lies and distrust, which applies to a lot of other marriages as well. So yes it is a realistic movie that shows the downfall of a family living in a suburban neighborhood in 1955, but it just wasn't that interesting and sort of dry, which might have been the point. The main highlight was John Givings(Michael Shannon) who has a illness, give or take. Which makes him speak his mind constantly while spouting just about anything that he feels to be true, and the outcome can be extremely rude, but satisfying to watch. Since it shatters Frank and April's fantasies and snaps them back to reality which they tried so hard to deny. Not that I have sympathy for people that have mental illnesses and commit crimes and get away with just a tap on the wrist or anything. But he was most definitely the highlight of this film. All in all, it was like watching a play, a depressing and yet pretty good play. I can't help but feel a bit of irony out of the ending to 'Revolutionary Road' since in 'Titanic' one of the two lovers die first. In this one the death roles seems to have been switched, even if this one is based on a novel. The theme of this film is 'Everyone wants out. Everyone wants in. Everyoneï»¿ wants to want...To want nothing is to have everything.'7.4/10",7,0,1,8 November 2009
28 Days Later...," Probably the first zombie movie I seen and I liked it
","Yeah zombie movies has been done many times. But what makes this movie stand out is the atmosphere, the way it's directed and the feeling of being alone during the chaos. As the movie progresses you don't know what is going to happen next. This isn't just a zombie movie well it is, but it also has a bit of humanity in it as well. The origin of the zombie virus is irritating to watch but is also a plus in a way as well. This is also probably the first movie I seen with Cillian Murphy and the guy is a very good actor. And the way he portrays a character that is alone and doesn't know what is going on is very believable. So the premise is after the spread of a virus that turns people into zombies, Jim played by Cillian Murphy is alone and doesn't know what is going on in a abandoned London. But is in for a whole lot of zombie chaos and something more. Also what makes this movie more frightening is how turning into a zombie isn't a slow process in this, you turn from 10 to 20 seconds. The directing is done in a way that is grimy and gritty, which works for a movie like this.7.8/10",7,0,2,24 February 2012
The Lost World: Jurassic Park," A solid sequel to a classic
","This is a solid follow up to a classic dinosaur crisis movie. I remember watching this movie at the theater as a kid and enjoying the heck out of it. As a kid I just really found this film to be mesmerizing, exciting and entertaining. Watching it now I still found it to be a enthralling and fun movie to watch. The plot is coherent and the sense of action and excitement with the story is put together very well. There is a lot of good ideas and settings when it comes to the dinosaurs and human interactions and action sequences. It all melds together in the good old fashion Spielberg style. To the point it was thrilling from beginning to end. Most of the characters was coherent with the story and it was nice to see Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) as the main lead this time around, since he was a likable character in the first 'Jurassic Park' movie. Although the actress that played Ian's daughter was pretty bad when it comes to the acting department, at least in this film. Overall this movie is most definitely a worthwhile watch and it's one of those films I don't get why some reviewers bash on it.8.4/10",8,28,34,8 June 2015
It Follows," Not all that satisfying, but the vibe makes it worth the watch
","I actually liked the retro feel of this movie, especially when it came to the soundtrack. I think the vibe of this movie really helped it elevate it's atmosphere and such. While it also appearing to be a homage to horror movies from the 70's. I gotta admit I personally was creeped out when it came to the mystery surrounding what was going on. And when the first few times the incident starts to happen I found that there was some tension there. But after a while the film didn't appear to be all that scary. Creepy but the tension started to wear off after a while. The plot isn't all that original and has been done in other horror movies before. In fact it sort of felt like a blend of 'Halloween', 'Final Destination, 'Drag Me to Hell' and 'The Terminator' (1984). But what made this movie memorable was the execution and how it played upon with the atmosphere and the surroundings. Also the ambiguous mystery surrounding the plot actually added something alluring and yet creepy. Except I felt that certain things were a bit too ambiguous and certain things just didn't make much sense. Now I don't mean the characters had to get their magnifying glasses and start investigating like some of the mainstream horror movies that are out. But I felt certain explanations was needed to make this movie at least a bit more satisfying. Maybe it's being left out for the sequel that will delve into the origin of how the whole mess started. But since I am grading this movie right now, it felt like a good watch but lacked that high satisfying feel. Overall, this is a terrifying concept that is done with a good enough executuion to make it worth the watch.7.3/10",7,2,9,28 May 2015
Cars," Driven by good pacing, some substance and amazing animation
","'Cars' is a Pixar production that I think is mediocre. What drives this movie thought is the animation, the speed and attention to details. The animation is detailed with the vehicle movements and environment,it's cool and entertaining. In another words the CGI is just topnotch when this movie came out. When it comes to the plot, it's in a universe where cars are alive like humans except they are cars. And revolves around a hotshot NASCAR that lives in the fast-lane and has a cocky and a bit of a narcissistic attitude. Until he has no choice to be among different people and that changes his perception and mentality, while also changing him to become a better race-car. So yeah, this is a story that has been done before, I can actually think of couple of movies from the top of my head that has the similar or even same premise. Except this time it revolves around characters that are cars. I wasn't excepting much from this movie, nor did it exceed my expectation. But it's a very watchable movie, that is a fun ride...At least the first time around. I also thought the character development is good in this, not great but they did a pretty darn good job developing multiple characters. And by the end, I actually sort of cared for the characters. And making talking vehicles likable and have certain amount of emotions for is actually a commendable task in my opinion. I remember when I first saw a Chevron promotional animation as a kid and thought it would be cool if they made a movie out of it. And I would have eaten this movie up as a kid and for that I also give it credit, since this is suppose to be a family film. Overall, this isn't a groundbreaking Pixar movie or all that memorable. But the animation with a bit of substance actually makes this one a good watch.7.2/10",7,0,1,22 August 2014
Legend," Sort of reminded me of the manga 'Sanctuary'.
","I liked the first half of this movie but the second half took a nose dive. It wasn't terrible but it got drawn out and boring to sit through. If they delved more into the gangster rivalry elements and making deals to build more power I think it would have been more of a fun watch. Because when it came to all the drama parts the film seemed to just drag on and on. This is based on a true story that revolves around the Kray twins. One being the logical one that is good with business and is charismatic and charming. Thus making him a likable gangster others like to make deals with. While his brother is a bit of the loose canon and isn't all that mentally stable. Again this film started out with some flare and carried the right balance of being fast paced without it being overly gritty and dark. It sort of reminded me of the film 'Bronson' when it came to the style of it all. I personally liked this film because it sort of reminded me of the manga 'Sanctuary'. Overall, I enjoyed this one but it could have been better. Also I personally thought it would have been interesting if it delved into the twins trying to extort and take over as managers for 'The Beatles'. Which is something that actually happened.7.5/10",7,0,0,11 September 2016
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Impactful
","I first saw this movie as a kid and thought it was alright. Mainly because I didn't know what was going on and although the fight sequences was well shot and directed. I just didn't really get into it. I was really into Jackie Chan and Jet Li movies back then. Where the plot was silly but entertaining to watch. This is a movie with a well told story that has some amazing sword fight choreography going for it. The movie is about fates intertwining, romance that doesn't go over the top, and of course fighting. But the unfolding of the story and how everything plays out was just so darn fantastically paced. It was captivating from the start to finish, just to see how everything plays out. Even the drama aspect of this movie is the right amount. It has won awards for good reason. Not just because of the storytelling, but because of the acting, cinematography and choreography which is just well shot. Especially for a movie that came out in 2000. I think this is probably the first big Chinese movie to make it to the big screen in the US and leave an impact. Do I think this movie is a bit over-hyped? Yeah, it isn't a groundbreaking movie. But it's still a Chinese that left an impact when it first came out.8.3/10",8,0,4,18 September 2015
Gone Girl," Immersive mystery film with some nice twist and turns
","This is a thriller/mystery movie that has quite a lot of cool twist and turns and shock value. Sure, there are some plot holes and certain areas that just doesn't make much sense. But when it comes tot he overall package of the movie, it's actually crafted very well. It's one of those movie that when you think you have everything figured out, it makes another turn...In a good way. David Fincher is a great director and I was impressed with his movie 'Zodiac' which this has a similar vibe going for. Except with more immersive elements and less detective aspects going for it. Without giving much away when it comes to the plot. This is a movie that is worth seeing, especially if you are a audience member that enjoys watching mystery/thrillers.8.4/10",8,5,10,2 February 2015
Django Unchained," Probably the most action packed Tarantino film
","This is a southern/Western that compacts quite a bit of action, good dialogues and superb acting although it can be slightly over the top. But that is Quentin Tarantino's characters trademark. But in a way it lacks some strong substance that is in Tarantino's early movies and seemed to rely a bit more on the violence than a well better crafted characters. The characters are memorable to a degree but just lacked substance and the motives and why they strive for it to such a extent isn't all that clear. But in past Tarantino movies it's like that but it had better dialogues. Also the violence in this movie didn't seem well grafted into the story and scenarios while not leaving that big of an impact. I wouldn't say pointless but it has been done better in previous Tarantino films and way more memorable. I am not sure if Tarantino got some ideas from 'Sukiyaki Western Django' a Takashi Miike film that Tarantino made a cameo appearance in. Which is a really western comic book style movie and although 'Django Unchained' is better some scenarios seemed slightly similar. Unlike previous Tarantino movies though this one doesn't go in a messed up orders from what happens story wise but goes in a chronological order with few flashbacks. Some of the few characters that has strong presence in this movie is Django Freeman(Jamie Foxx) who is the least interesting one although he is the main character. But still glad Will Smith didn't get this role. Dr. King Schultz(Christoph Waltz) who plays a fake doctor bounty hunter who oppose slavery and no not the shoe doctor. Christoph Waltz nailed it as the Jew Hunter in 'Inglourious Basterds' and he really stands out in this one as well. Than there is Calvin J. Candie(Leonardo DiCaprio) who is this really evil and sadistic slave owner on a plantation called Candyland. In fact his character appear more ruthless than the Jew Hunter although the Jew Hunter probably killed more jews. But Candie's certain actions makes him appear like a really ruthless prick. And DiCaprio pulls it off, I don't know but he always does a fine job with these ambitious business like characters that is full of way too much pride. Samuel L. Jackson is also in this and he plays a brown noser for Calvin Candie but he is a badass brown noser if there is one and he has the most keen sighted character in this movie although despicable. But I can fully understand how some audiences would be offended by this character. What is interesting is how Django and Dr. King Schultz show there relationship in a way where Django is the dominant one to Calvin J. Candie. But behind closed door it's Stephen who is the dominant one to Calvin J. Candie. Stephen sorta reminded me of Uncle Ruckus from 'The Boondocks' and wouldn't be shocked if Quentin got his inspiration for one of his character from Uncle Ruckus. Another character that some viewers of that show would find offensive. Don Johnson also stands out a bit as a racist plantation owner that goes by Big Daddy although he doesn't have that many scenes. Despite few flaws this movie seemed to pass by pretty quickly although it's almost 3 hours long and wasn't bored with it at all.8.6/10",8,3,9,3 January 2013
Drive," Slick, edgy and artistic film that is awesome. Even the mass audiences will enjoy this film.
","I heard that this movie is split from audiences that enjoyed it and those that didn't. I fall into the category of the audiences that enjoyed it. I really think this is a artistic movie that can reach out to the masses. Yeah it's a artistic movie but it just didn't seemed that forced and most of the way through it was engrossing. Yes, even the first half of the film. The second half is better but I thought the first half was pretty good and didn't seem boring to me. But even I gotta admit the first scene of this movie was one of the most awesome opening to a movie, it was cool while having a bit of tension to it. Ryan Gosling was really good in this and almost perfect for this role as the slick, quiet, reserved, cool and yet dangerous character. The rest of the cast is stunning as well and the 80's vibe was great, especially the music in this. Another thing that is stunning is how it's directed, there might not be that much going on but the way it's directed in a artistic old school manner makes it great. I also enjoyed how the characters sometimes uses the emotions of there body instead of dialogue to convey what they are feeling and thinking, especially with Ryan Gosling. Maybe I need to see this again but for the first watch it was awesome. If your one of those audiences that wants to see chase scenes similar to the 'Fast and the Furious' movies or something along the lines of 'Transporter' with it's ridiculousness might be left disappointed. This is a edgy and artistic flick that revolves around a character that is a stuntman by morning and a getaway driver by night. Just wish there was just one more cool drive scene near the end cause it just seemed to lack that although the title of this movie is 'Drive'. Anyways this movie proves that artistic movies can not only be compelling but fun as well.9/10",9,2,6,20 September 2011
Insidious," Silly at times but still pretty darn scary
","I was in the mood for a really scary movie and I heard this movie was really scary so I decided to check it out. This really is a scary movie although silly at times, but when it comes to the scare factor, it can get really scary and has tension to it as well. I wish the main demon had a different design to it cause some audiences tend to make fun of it a lot instead of get intimidated by it. It basically looks like a Darth Maul Demon and when it actually shows the ghost it loses it's edge. The violin scores is what builds the scare in this movie, cause just the violin scores is frightening. There is almost no blood and gore in this movie which proves that you don't need those elements to make a movie that is actually scary. Anyone looking for a good scare should see this flick.7.6/10",7,0,1,10 July 2011
The Theory of Everything," ClichÃ© but elegant
","I will say that Eddie Redmayne and Felicity Jones really does knocks it out of the park. They really do bring this movie to life, which is a Biography on the relationship between Stephen Hawking and his wife. I will admit the movie did get boring at times for me which I sort of feel guilty about. Since it's about a man that has a brilliant mind but deals with a illness that paralyzes his body. And tries to cope with the situation while having a relationship and coming up with theory on time and existence. The cinematography is beautifully shot and the music really fits into the environment. What I thought that was lacking was a bit more substance and less clichÃ©. Also the lack of science and how Hawking came up with his theory could disappoint some audiences. Although the actor was spot on playing Stephen Hawking but more focus on his thought process and answering to why and how of certain areas of the character would have made it better in my own opinion. Oh and also I don't know all about the whole relationship situation between Hawking and his first wife, but his first wife was a sacrificial saint. So yeah, it's a elegantly crafted movie that might come off a bit too clichÃ© to some audiences including myself.6.5/10",6,1,1,5 February 2015
Frozen," One of the best I seen all year!
","This is a entertaining magical drama that is surely worth seeing. As a matter of fact I want to see it again. Despite it lacking very slightly in certain areas, like a bit more development would have been nice. But it has just about everything I wanted from a CGI animated drama. And when I say drama, it's fast-paced and enjoyable. I couldn't help, but feel drawn into this magical world. I usually don't really like musical scores in movies, but I was amused and entertained by just about all of it in this. The music in this, is just superb. I usually tend to respect or at least try to understand other reviewer's reviews. But just about all the super negative things said about this movie seemed to be very very very nitpicky. Despite few very very very nitpicky negative reviews, this movie is a treat. A emotionally touching treat, that melts with warm goodness. Plus it even has a good message to go with it. I am currently hooked on the musical score 'Let It Go' by Indina Menzel, which is the movie's theme song. Overall, this is a highly fun and enjoyable movie that the whole family will have a good time with.9.4/10",9,2,5,30 December 2013
2012," What Roland Emmerich calls his last disaster film
","2012 just basically tries to impress the audiences with special effects showing destruction after destruction and that is all it basically does. But that is just what you would expect from a Roland Emmerich films, although I will admit some were actually sort of entertaining. But since this is his last disaster movie or so he claimed, I actually sort of had a bit of expectations for this. But besides the special effects all it offered was hollow characters and very stereotypical and dumb characters, the plot wasn't even intelligent and was actually dull. The destruction is cool to look at but after a while you start to get numb to it. So what Emmerich does is show destruction after destruction of certain monuments around the world. So the plot is basically this, in the Mayan calendar it is predicted that in 2012 on winter solstice the planets will line up which will cause solar flares and it will effect earth in a way it will cause major destruction and during this chaos people are trying to survive. And while this is going on it hardly shows any death, mainly just destruction. This is a silly disaster film and a very long one at that, I mean it was actually kinda fun to watch the destruction and all but when a film like this is over 2 and a half hours long, than you just start to get bored. Anyways as dumb as it is, this is worth checking out on the big screen to get everything out of it, which is basically the special effects.6.2/10",6,0,1,14 February 2010
Ghost Rider," Disappointing Ghost Rider movie
","This movie is way below average comic book movie that has almost no appeal going for it. The movie starts out alright but as it progresses it gets worse and worse. The plot is horribly written to the point it has too much plot holes and while your watching you will be constantly asking the question 'why?'. The characters makes no sense what so ever and even the villains are not developed and some are just pointless to the plot while not bringing any cool in the action department either. The dialogue is just laughable and not in a good way either and comes of very corny, even the direction is corny. Which is a negative for a Ghost Rider movie. I like Nicholas Cage as and actor and he is basically the only thing that makes this movie semi-watchable. The back and forth plot in this is just irritating to watch and makes you not care for the characters even more. For a movie that had a budget of over 100 million this movie just didn't seem like it and just looked cheap and lazy. Mark Steven Johnson should stop making comic book movies.4.6/10",4,0,0,18 February 2012
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not a terrible installment, but the first two was much better
","Had the biggest budget from the three movies and yet it's probably the worst one in the trilogy. The director obviously wasn't a comic book fan cause this movie contradicts a lot of the stuff in the comics. It just seemed like the director didn't know what he was doing and just relied way too much on the special effects instead of concentrating on a good story that wasn't too far off from the marvel universe. Wolverine(Hugh Jackman) is the main hero this time once again and with every installment Jackman seems to nail the character even better each time. But what I really disliked is how his character is a bit too emotional, which isn't a part of his characteristics in the comics. The special effects I will admit is entertaining to watch but a more tighter and better script that will leave the audiences engaged most of the way through would have made this movie a great summer movie. But it just lacked those key elements and just concentrated way too much on mutants and powers. Some of the characters were pointless and it seemed like the director just wanted to put in as many mutants as possible. Even the direction and the plot with the characters is incoherent. Which might be okay for some viewers as long as it has a lot of action and special effects but I didn't find it all that engaging or gripping. Overall this movie is a very poor comic book adaptation and the Phoenix part of the story almost went nowhere. It's not a terrible installment, but the first two was much better.6.8/10",6,0,1,29 June 2011
Good Will Hunting," The feels
","This is the breakout film for Matt Damon. And for good reasons, this is a heartfelt film that delves into the mind and heart of a young math genius that mops the college floors. The story really does have humanity in it and how some people can use their power or gifts to do the right thing. Instead of just capitalizing on it while stepping over and ruining the lives of others. This film is about living without regrets and having the empathy to show compassion for others. And being able to getting past the trauma, heartache and pain to be able to move forward and find love. Robin Williams really shines in this film and puts on a moving and empathetic performance. Overall, this is a must see film that I would highly recommend. If you have heart or at least have a bit of empathy you will really be drawn into this one.10/10",10,0,1,23 August 2016
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," It's a wonderful and imaginative movie
","The main charm about this film is how the audiences can actually connect and relate with the protagonist of this story. About a average guy that has a vivid imagination and the habit of zoning out, going on a journey to see and go on a adventure. Although random it's enthralling to see Mitty's imagination come to life in his mind. This is a well made movie that is immersive and imaginative. I liked the message of how 'not to just be a dreamer, but try to seek out and achieve that dream'. It even has a great soundtrack to go with it. This movie is probably a story of a lot of us.8.4/10",8,1,2,15 April 2014
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," War of the Ring
","I said this before but I highly recommend anyone to watch the extended edition for this. It was a real treat seeing this in theater, but seeing the extended edition you can't help but appreciate this film even more. The first film in this trilogy was mesmerizing, and for the most part this movie is mesmerizing as well with it's amazing action set pieces and design but just not as much as the first film. And although it's engrossing I didn't feel the magical experience that I had with the first movie. But that still isn't to say this movie is any less, this film really leaves a mark in cinema and is a memorable movie that will stick with the audience for a long period of time. The first movie in this trilogy is inspirational in many ways but this film is inspirational as well with it's fantasy, magic and action. It will inspire countless movies and especially when it comes to video games. The story is superb although the whole movie leads up to a huge battle at Helm's Deep. The atmosphere is more dark and blue this time which adds a lot to the feel of this film. And I couldn't help myself but care about the cause for the big battle to come and the actual main party that is fighting against Sauron's army. Yes, there are some one liners in this but those one liners stands out in a good way and gets the emotions going and kept me pumped up for whats to come. The speech during battles was actually one of them and it works. The characters in this with the circumstances made honor and virtue really stand out while some characters must fight through temptations. To be honest I liked Tolkien's book this movie is adapted from but found it a bit dry so I didn't really see that big of a problem when Jackson decided to spice things up a bit while staying true to the main story at hand. Even if few great parts of the book is different in the movie, the movie makes up for it for the most part. Although a lot of Tolkien fans might disagree with this, but it's just my opinion. This movie wasn't as enthralling or magical as 'Fellowship' but it holds it's rightful place in this trilogy and is a great film. Just wasn't enthralling as it's predecessor which was a masterpiece but this one comes pretty close. Some may say this movie isn't well edited but like I said before you have to watch the extended edition to truly appreciate this movie, it just has those key scenes including battle sequences that is missing from it theater release. Anyways this is a awesome second part of the trilogy that should not be missed although it's probably not good as 'Fellowship'.8.8/10",Null,0,1,8 October 2011
The Incredibles," Pretty boring Pixar film
","I personally think this is a overrated Pixar movie. The premise could have worked for me, but the direction was just bland and not all that creative. It's like watching a slightly better Saturday morning cartoon movie with a way higher budget. There just didn't seem to be any good emotional depth to this movie. The whole movie is about a family with super powers dealing with family issues while fighting the bad guys. Yeah, most super hero movies is about the hero fighting agains the bad guys, but in this the whole thing felt generic. I remember first watching this in theaters and not getting much out of it. I was actually more bored than entertained. The 3D animation was pretty good when it came out, it's developed by Pixar after all. But besides the good animation when this movie came out, that just seems like it's all that is going for this movie. It's not a bad movie, it's actually worth a watch in my opinion. But I just wasn't highly invested like I am with other Pixar films. Overall, this is a bland animated superheroes movie with some well animated action scenes. However all the creativity just went to the action scenes.5.5/10",5,2,4,5 August 2015
The Mist," Fear of the unknown
","'The Mist' wasn't a great movie, but I liked how it showed some human nature in the film how when worst comes to worst it's survival of the fullest. But the aspect I really like in some horror movies is when the people that are trying to survive barricade themselves in a place where they are safe and one or few people are like 'oh we can't take it anymore' or some other stupid reason and tries to leave and in doing so screws it up for everyone else. It's the same case for this film as well big time, seriously Andre Braugher is way better than this and so it was really disappointing. The moonstruck woman really makes you get angry and I think that was the intention, but gosh was she knowing constantly babbling on while using religion for her own benefit not that it never happens but she was really irritating to the point you just want to pull her out of the screen Sadako style and choke her. The main aspect of the film I enjoyed was that it really portrays a lot of people's lives how scary the unknown is and trying to take the easy way out. It was a decent horror movie.7.6/10",7,0,2,17 October 2009
Stardust," This doesn't get the recognition it deserves but Twilight does?
","I saw this movie when it first came out mainly because it was directed by Matthew Vaughn who previously directed 'Layer Cake' at that time which is another movie I thoroughly enjoyed. And because it was written by Neil Gaiman who did some really good graphic novels. This is a imaginative fantasy movie that combines depths and empathy to it. It has some modern touches to it when it comes to how some people deal with certain situations although it takes place in a fantasy setting. So in another words this is a fantasy movie that people can resonate with, well at least some of it. It fuses symbols and metaphors into the story effectively. While also delving into the genuine heart and the distance people will go to for love. Messages such as in this movie about accepting who you are and doing what you enjoy instead of becoming something your not to please others. It's quite a unique movie that has different varieties of characters. My favorite character being Captain Shakespeare played by Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro really did a great job making this character come to life. I don't know, it's always nice to see cool old guys in fantasy flicks. It's a shame this film didn't do so well when it came to the box office ticket sales. I think it's because it was suppose to be a family movie that tried very hard to cater to the young adults as well. Which might have come off as a bit unbalanced for some viewers. Which is a shame really, because this is actually a really good fantasy romance adventure story.8/10",8,3,3,16 February 2016
The Bourne Legacy," A set up for a sequel without it being satisfying
","Now I wasn't really hyped about this sequel or anything like that but had some expectations. Cause the past 3 Bourne movies were actually good. With good amount of action and intelligent that can get more convoluted than it has to but it's still a great action franchise. Now this one doesn't have Jason Bourne(Matt Damon) in it, since he probably declined the offer to be in this sequel. And is now replaced by Jeremy Renner as Aaron Cross. And there is also Rachel Weisz as the tag along girl for the main guy on the run from a big corporation that wants them both dead. Now the acting from the two including Edward Norton is spot on good. Edward Norton is the new head of Treadstone after Alexander Conklin. And he barks orders most of the way through in this. This whole movie is basically the bad guys trying to cover things up and get rid of any loose ends, even if it means killing people. The other Bourne movies were the same but this one is more direct about it, while lacking the cleverness of the previous movies. When this movie ends however it feels like it's missing quite a bit. It's a Bourne movie but it just didn't seem to have enough action as well. Leaving room for sequels is alright as long as the movie is satisfying but that isn't the case here. It just felt like a set up for the next movie in this franchise without it being satisfying. A good way to leaver room for a sequel is when the movie itself is satisfying but you anticipate and crave for the next movie. That just isn't the case for this one. The story in this isn't even as intelligent as it tries to make it seem. Overall this movie isn't terrible but for a Bourne movie, it doesn't have much to make it stand out.6/10",6,2,8,13 August 2012
22 Jump Street," Let's just say it's not that bad for a comedic sequel...
","This is the typical buddy cop comedy sequel with a bigger budget and more stuff going on including the expansion when it comes to the bromance. But it just isn't as good as the original and things just seemed to forced a lot of times. I could tell they were trying very hard to make it a hilarious comedy. I just didn't find this movie all that funny or in tune as the first one. Actually it comes across more as a rehash than a actual sequel with the duo looking for the head of the drug dealings. Except it takes place in college and it's Greg Jenko that is having fun this time while Morton Schmidt is just not having that good of a time...Besides banging a college girl. So the roles this time are sort of reversed. The movie does make fun of itself sometimes and parodies sequels a LOT. They do self-referential jokes, but I don't think that gives it a pass to be just a mediocre comedy compared to the first one. And it seemed like they were constantly using that to hide the fact that this just isn't better than the first one and that they ran out of good creative ideas. I thought since they are poking fun of sequels so much, maybe it will do things that deviate from that. Despite the 'do the same thing as last time and people will be happy' quote. But it basically goes the same exact direction. The chemistry between the duo is actually pretty good though. But it just wasn't hysterical or exciting when it blends action/comedy elements. Some of the jokes even started to drag after a while. The villains this time is very forgettable and doesn't stand out at all with Peter Stormare doing the same thing he always does when playing a villain. I thought the first one did a great job with the build up and development, but this one just falls short. If it wasn't for the first installment, I am not sure I would have even found this sequel to be enjoyable. The audiences expression at the theaters was just 'eh' and that was it. As far as comedy sequels go, this one is actually alright. Lets say it's way better than the 2 'The Hangover' sequels. I found the comedy elements in 'Neighbors' to be more funny than this one. Maybe my expectations were too high since I liked the first installment in this franchise. It's worth a matinÃ©e price maybe or a rental.6.2/10",6,3,8,28 June 2014
Dog Day Afternoon," Crisis Intervention
","I had to watch this film for a project in my Crisis Intervention class and I am glad the professor picked this film for the assignment. Not only does he have a kick-ass personality as a professor, but seems to have good taste in movies. One of the students that saw this film said it's just a crazy movie and not worth seeing. I completely disagree and what made this film amazing and crazy in a good way is how it's all based on a true story. And just about the whole films takes place in or near a bank. This again shows you don't need huge explosions and a bunch of CGI effects to make a great movie. It has quite a bit of psychological elements that show how certain scenarios and agenda can change the perspective and thinking manner of people. It goes through 4 steps of people put into crisis and heading into crisis.1. Participating Event- The bank robbers has a agenda of making quick cash by just basically charging head first into a bank with guns. And able to make a getaway. Not the main character in this film is Sonny Wortzik played by Al Pacino who puts on a magnificent performance. Sonny is an intelligent guy that knows the system, but is delusional and lacks common sense. Which I think, they thought was equivalent to robbing a McDonalds or a liquor store. So yeah, their participating even was to just barge in take the money by threatening the workers with guns than make a quick getaway from their vehicle.2. Perception- Like I said their perception was delusional, but it also starts to get distorted as they start to dig their own grave. Which basically starts, because of smokes that start up because one of the robbers decides to burn some papers. This gets the attention of certain people outside the bank. The bank robbers, mainly Sonny's thoughts become more delusional when they get into some deep trouble by getting surrounded by cops. The robbers, well at least Sonny starts to really believe the feds will provide a plane for them to escape on. The civilians outside the banks start to think of Sonny the outlaw as a hero of some sort because of what Sonny claims to stand for. The hostages cooperates with Sonny and actually wants them to make a getaway and for the feds to provide them with what they want. Even some of the feds seemed to have some sort of sympathy for the guy. He is that much of a likable bank robber. Heck I even wanted them to make a getaway, which made the ending more tense for myself. It just shows how people's perception can change depending on the agenda and circumstances.3. Subjective Distress- Just about all the characters are dealing with some sort of distress, besides the civilians. The hostages are dealing with if they are able to make it home safely or not. However they seem to have more discomfort with the heat and the cops over being fearful of the bank robbers. I however think the bank robbers has the most distress, to the point of becoming delusional. They are facing getting buried. It's actually interesting to see how these characters that are based on real people deal with distress.4. Lowered Functioning- This is understandable since as human being deals with anxiety and stress, their function level deteriorates. The bank robbers thinking process, their tenacity and energy starts shrinking as the story progresses. It shows the psychological and physical aspects of what happens when people deal with tough situations.The situation was more danger than an opportunity. There was more danger and failure involved than success.When it comes to if the crisis was more developmental or situational. I would have to say both. Both factors come into play in this film. The characters go through situational problems, however it becomes developmental. Since the characters start to dig their own grave and it develops into more troubling matter through robber's delusions.Films or stories like this, shows no matter how much the world might have a set of principles. The cause of the matter can sometimes change the perception of others. The situation of the matter can change the perspective.When it comes to therapy in chapter 8 of 'A Guide to Crisis Intervention' it talks about how when sometimes, actually a lot of the times when people face something they can't change no matter what. They tend to go through the bargaining stage, no matter how unrealistic it may seem. They will latch onto the thought of being able to change the matter at hand through bargaining. And that is what the robbers tried to do. I enjoy psychologically realistic films like this.This is an entertaining and at times funny film that has tension. This is a film that starts out slow, but keeps on building and building.8.4/10",8,0,1,21 April 2014
Cars 2," I thought it was a entertaining ride.
","I am one of the few that actually had more fun with this sequel than the first one. Sure, it has elements that has been done in other movies before, except it revolves around living cars. But the creativity and clever moments makes this one a entertaining ride. While the first one's protagonist was Lightning this time, the likable hillbilly truck Mater takes the spotlight. Sure, he maybe dunce but he is a likable and funny dunce. One of the premise that doesn't get old for me, is where a average or below Joe gets put in a over a top situation. And some of the characters surrounding him or her mistakenly think he or she to be some sort of a amazing hero or heroine. The dialogue is hip and fun, the comedic parts may seem a bit childish, but it's clever and I personally thought it was funny. The animation goes into another level with this one, and the detail when it comes to the environments which takes place in Radiator Springs, Japan, Paris and England. And the animation is again superb and better. Sure, it's not in depth or emotional as the other Pixar movies, but it's still a entertaining good time. I also think the transition to Mater was a good idea, because it brings out a certain amount of uniqueness. As a matter of fact this movie kinda reminded me of animated version 'Tucker & Dale vs. Evil', except it's for the whole family to enjoy.7.8/10",7,4,4,22 August 2014
Amadeus," It kept hitting the right key notes
","This movie is one heck of a experience that really knows how to hit the key notes. Sure, it has a simple narrative that is easy to follow but it's more driven by the vision and the experience for the audiences over the narrative. Now this movie has gotten some backlash, mainly because of it's depiction of the historical figures. So yeah, although the story might not entirely be focused on telling the exact truth, it does a fine job of blending fiction with reality. Because it does have important scenes that are deemed to be historically accurate or assumed to be. Never the less, the main focal point of this movie isn't to tell the step by step of Mozart's life. But to make it a experience that would draw the audiences in with it's depth and soul. Even the directing style comes of slightly strange when it comes down to it. So the story is told from the perspective of Antonio Salieri who was one of the well known composer during his prime as a composer. But in this film he is depicted as a mediocre composer trying to be more than what he is. Salieri in this comes across as a overly self-righteous, pompous jerk that has a huge jealousy towards the musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Since Mozart in this film is portrayed as a party guy that loves the ladies and just like enjoying the moment with his lavish spendings. Which kind of makes him a rock star during his time period. And since the demeanor of Antonio Salieri is vastly different from Mozart, Salieri not only makes Mozart his rival but his sworn enemy. Sometimes people like to pick apart and only try to focus on the negative side of someone they are jealous towards and that really shows through Salieri in this. He is a character that will do whatever it takes to bring Mozart down by slowly diminishing Mozart's chances to show his musical talents to the world to see. In this, while Mozart is a musical prodigy Salieri is a mediocre composer that is gifted in scheming, manipulating and has a very cunning persona. It shows the colliding of personalities and the ill intentions of Salieri as he picks apart Mozart. I also found Mozart's focus when it comes to his music and how he enjoyed life and his family to be touching and yet interesting. May it be entirely true or not, the man was a musical genius and his music will continue to carry on for generations. Overall though, this is a intriguing movie that I thoroughly enjoyed despite it being 3 hours. It's quite a depressing film though, so I probably wouldn't pick it up immediately to watch it again. But I will say, it is a splendid film and a experience.9/10",9,1,2,19 July 2016
The Game," That ending though...
","Now I wouldn't be surprised if the director for 'Saw' got some of his idea from this movie. Now the main reason I wanted to check this movie out is because it's directed by David Fincher. The guy is just meticulous and entertaining when it comes to the thriller genre. Now I like watching movies that revolve around a test or some sort of a game the characters need to overcome and the trials they need to face. As long as it's done in a innovative, immersive, interesting and entertaining to watch approach. Now I am not picky to the point to say it must have a high level grades in these aspects. But good enough to keep me invested to what is going to happen next and how they are going to go about it. So in that department, 'The Game' works. So the plot is about a emotionally distant and selfish business man played by Michael Douglas. Entering a program called CRS as a gift from his younger brother for his 48th birthday. Weird and negative stuff that doesn't make much sense starts to happen to him. The constant guessing and trying to figure out what exactly is going on is the main drive going for this movie. If the movie was a bit more clever and had Michael Douglas trying to fit the puzzle together and you follow along with that. It might have been more interesting though. The movie had my attention most of the way through, but it also got a bit boring a few times. But knew when to pick it up by adding twists and turns or something cool just when my attention to the story started to run out. Plus David Fincher is really good at putting in that odd mysterious elements. Where you as an audience can't help but feel that something is off. So the build up is quite good, but the ending. Now the ending was pretty darn far-fetched. Besides that it's a pretty cool thriller that is worth checking out.8/10",8,1,2,11 October 2015
Kick-Ass," As corny as it may seem, this movie really does kick ass.
","Not only is this movie ballsy, it really did beat my expectations. It's rare when a movie is way better than the trailer and this movie is just one of them. Sure there are a few flaws in other people's opinion, on how this isn't a plausible superhero movie, and more of a wannabe superhero's fantasy. And how the main protagonist Kick-Ass is overshadowed by other characters, mainly Hit-Girl who is so entertaining to watch on screen. Not only is this one of the best wannabe superhero movie out there, it also beats out a lot of superhero movies. It's been a while since I had some much fun in the theaters, I was thoroughly entertained. This really isn't a superhero movie for kids, but screw that. I don't really care cause this movie was ballsy and yet very entertaining to watch, plus there is plenty of good movies for kids out already. Also this movie probably isn't going to be the funniest movie of the year, but those holy crap moments are just so very cool, you can't help but laugh. It really did beat my expectation on every level and I can't wait to watch it again. I am glad the distributors decided not to dumb this movie down for the younger audiences, the director Matthew Vaughn has made some good movies in the past and I sure hope he keeps doing so. The soundtrack was rocking as well and it fit the scenes it needed to fit in. Nicolas Cage did a great job with his role as well, it's been a while since he was featured in a great movie that deserves to be seen in theaters and glad he ain't going to waste, he was entertaining to watch as well.8.8/10",8,5,17,16 April 2010
Unknown," Taken 2: My Taken Identity
","Well it's sort of like that and could have been a sequel although it would have been a bit too far fetched. When walking into the theater to watch this movie, I was at least hoping a movie that is in the level of Liam Neeson's past movie 'Taken'. Since the trailer to this movie looked sort of similar and all and even the main character seemed a bit similar. But it did not meet my expectation, and the friend I dragged to see the movie was constantly moving in his chair, checking his phone and taking a deep breath a few times. What I wanted was a simple action movie that has enough flare to be worth seeing in theaters. If it was paced a bit faster and had a bit more better action sequences and connected better and quicker, it might have not been as boring. But the thing is this movie is dull in a lot of parts, it wants to intrigue the audience with the mystery of what is really going on but it just doesn't really work all that well. The movie tries to focus more on the plot and mystery but it's all so darn dull most of the time and didn't really care what happened. The execution isn't even all that clever and relies way to much on amnesia in a very stupid manner, you will see when you watch the movie. Overall, it's a pretty disappointing movie. It wasn't really terrible or anything like that but it took some effort to finish it.4.5/10",4,2,4,9 April 2011
Gran Torino," The positive aspects overcomes the negative by a huge margin for this
","Some people that praise this movie say it's worth watching, but just wait until it comes out on DVD or Blu-ray. I disagree, yeah it's a low budget movie, but it's one of those low budget movies that is worth seeing it in theaters because of a brilliant performance by Clint Eastwood with a riveting script. This film is basically a atonement for Clint Eastwood's violent characters he played and it works really really well in this. The movie has heart and just seeing the friendship build while Clint acts as a mentor, a grumpy mentor but a good one was just brilliant with good values to go with it. So yeah, fabulous acting by Clint and a great script with values, is a must watch. Yeah it has some tiny violent scenes, but it's one of those movies that is still worth taking out your whole family to watch. Although the movie is not in theaters any more, watch this during family movie night or something. The movie will make you laugh with it's humor that has heart to it and make you sad in a good way, during the depressing scenes. Sure I agree with few of the other reviewers complaints, but there is just too many positive things about this film than the negative.8.1/10",8,0,3,21 September 2010
Shrek the Third," Third time isn't really the charm for this franchise
","Third time might not be the charm for this series, but it's still a decent movie. In fact I actually liked this movie, sure it isn't good as the first two but it's a movie well worth the watch. Instead of a movie, it feels more like a episode of a CGI animated TV show except you can tell the animation is high budget and high quality. It may seem like there isn't enough effort that went into this third installment and may seem like a cheap cash in...Which might be somewhat true. But the movie has decent stuff going for it. Although this one has more characters than the past two movies, there just wasn't as much chemistry between them. I was constantly anxious for the movie to get better but it just seemed to get slower and duller. This isn't a terrible movie but lacked the cleverness of the previous two movies.5.5/10",Null,1,2,18 August 2011
The Hurt Locker," 'War is hell' to some 'War is a drug' to others
","This is one of the most original and well crafted war movie I have ever seen, after seeing it once I just had to see it again in theater. This is a war movie with emotion and psychological aspects to it and for the most part everything works really well. The plot revolves around a bomb disposal unit and it's easy to get attached to these characters which makes a lot of the scenes tense and gut-wrenching. I can understand some of the criticisms this movie has been getting, about how it's unrealistic and inaccurate and not really true when it comes to how real soldiers do things in the military. Although I have no military background some aspects of it seemed a bit far-fetched. But I still found this movie to be brilliant, it isn't like most war movies where there is a specific mission. There are some missions, but that is just the surface of this movie. It has some psychological parts to it and it's about the experience of few soldiers and what comes later on. This isn't a complicated or convoluted war movie, but it's a simple and yet there is emotion and I got a bit of the sense of fear and tension these soldiers were facing in the movie. This is Jeremy Renner's big break and his performance in this was outstanding, I enjoyed every scene he was in despite him being the main character and all. But yeah again I can understand the complaint about how this movie sort of tries to sell it like it's a very realistic war movie and some people with real military background can spot out the unrealistic parts about this movie. But some of the general idea of a bomb squad and the emotion and fear they have to face is still intact. Despite some unrealistic aspects of this movie, it's still compelling movie that had my attention all the way through it. This is a different war movie and like what some reviewers are claiming, civilians will praise it and veterans will probably dislike it. Maybe it's because I am a civilian, but I found this movie to be a movie most definitely worth checking out despite some flaws and weaknesses. Never the less it's a very good effort by Kathryn Bigelow.8.8/10",8,3,6,9 March 2011
X-Men: Apocalypse," The weakest in the trilogy, but not bad.
","Maybe it's because I had a bigger expectation for this film, but it was aiight. In the movie there is a scene where mutant students come out of the theater after watching 'Return of the Jedi'. And says something along the lines of the third installment being the worst. And that basically applies to this film, because in my opinion it's the weakest compared to the previous two X-Men movies. It's in no way a bad movie, but it just wasn't anything all that amazing either. Because the editing and progression of the story just wasn't all that compelling or interesting. Watching this movie was like watching 'Rocky 4', it's alright but just not good as 'Rocky' and 'Rocky 2'. The plot is basically about Apocalypse getting resurrected, finding his four horsemen while the new group of students get recruited into Xavier Institute. With it focusing in on Magneto the most next to Apocalypse with his side story and what makes him tick. It really did show how how much of a human character Magneto really is. I mean even the kindest people out there has a breaking point when you push them to their limit. I guess the human side of Magneto and the understanding of where he is coming from to a degree is what makes him one of the most popular comic book villains out there. The other horsemen that Apocalypse chooses just seemed to be shoehorned into the movie. There is few scenes that did stand out and it's basically the super action sequences. There is the introduction scene, Quicksilver to the rescue scene, Wolverine going berserker rage mode, Quicksilver fighting Apocalypse, Professor X going Freddy Krueger and Phoenix Force. So overall I don't regret seeing this movie in the theater, I do however regret seeing it in 4D. Because I personally thought it just wasn't worth it for this one. You can tell a lot about a man if you give him the crown and what he chooses to do with his power and how he treats people that are less fortunate. And I liked that type of message in this movie. Although the whole thing of the team getting together and bonding like a family isn't anything new but was nicely done. So I give this movie a 7.4/10.7.4/10",7,22,37,6 June 2016
Slap Shot," Underdog story about a team that plays to reach the top in a immoral way
","This is a hockey comedy and I can see why this movie is known by some people as one of the best hockey movie that adults and probably teens can enjoy. It just has certain elements that make it a cult classic. But I don't know, maybe this movie just wasn't for me because I didn't find it all that enjoyable, it was entertaining. But just didn't meet the hype that I was expecting from this cause just about every movie critic seems to have enjoyed this. The plot is about a constantly losing hockey team run by Reggie 'Reg' Dunlop(Paul Newman) and the team is hated by everyone because of there constant losing streak. But soon the team builds a reputation for being hockey goons and some dislike them but they also gain a lot of fans and most audiences want to see them play. So basically they turn hockey into WWE smackdown on ice and the audiences just seem to enjoy watching violence more than a game of legit hockey. And Dunlop is all for this because his team is starting to get popular. And there is bunch of comedic moments thrown in between or in the game. Paul Newman was good in this as a carefree coach that just wants his team to survive and get popular over how good the team is in hockey which makes him some enemies. His carefree but ambitious attitude just worked well in this flick. Despite it not feeling all that engaging for me as an audience or feel really connected to the team or anything like that or most of the characters. It does have legit aspects to it, since there is no special effects and everything that happen on screen is basically real. Now like I said I can see why this movie has elements that make it a cult classic but I can also see why this movie would appeal to small audiences. It just isn't a movie for everyone, but for those that like the 70's feel and nostalgic elements during the 70's and put together in a well crafted manner...You just might really enjoy this flick. I just thought the build up was pretty weak and didn't feel emotional or anything like that or even wanted to root for the main team and it's not because they are hockey goons.6.5/10",6,4,5,14 May 2012
The Amazing Spider-Man 2," C'mon Webb! Hopefully this build-up is worth it for the next installment...Which won't happen
","Well this one is at least better than the first one in my opion. Although a lot of critics may disagree with me on this. However it's still a disappointing sequel that appears to be a jumbled mess. And a poor flow and editing when it comes to the story. After the credits started rolling, I just wasn't like 'man, I want to see this movie again sometime later'. It has like 3 villains, actually 2 with one being the main villain. Rhino and even Electro is very underutilized. The execution is cool, but it's just not entertaining to watch or attention grabbing when compared to 'Spider-Man 2'. As a matter of fact, I actually checked the time quickly few times in the theater. Because the whole thing seemed to drag, despite it having a lot of stuff going on in order to build up for the next installment. And I think that is one of the things made this film falter in certain areas. Because instead of it trying to be it's own movie, it tried to set up for the sequel. No, complaints if it worked but for the most part it doesn't. Electro is a bit over the top, when it comes to his development into villainy but understandable and somewhat believable. Maybe because some part of me can empathize with Electro. The chemistry between Peter and Gwen is better this time around though. Andrew Garfield seemed to have really gotten the hang of playing Spider-Man which was something I wasn't all that sure of in the first one. And there is more athletic and acrobatic Spidey moves this time around. It's more of a Peter Parker movie than a Spider-Man movie which would have been fine, if it was executed better. The CGI and the Spidey acrobatics is top notch though. I personally think if it revolves more around the person behind the costume, it has to be executed very well. Now I don't mind build up in movies, but this one just wasn't one of the really good ones. This movie just felt more like a appetizer than a full course meal when it was done and finished. There just wasn't anything that made this movie really stand out for a Spider-Man movie. It just seemed underdeveloped even for a build up for the next installment. Overall this is a alright sequel, not great but just alright. Although it lacked the heart and the soul of other superhero movies like 'Spider-Man 2'. And has quite a lot of plot- holes and far-fetched scenarios when it comes to the context of the story. I still thought it was a very watchable movie, not great but it was a decently fun ride. Oh and I am glad they decided to use the original Spider-Man costume design this time around.7.5/10",7,0,5,6 May 2014
Ex Machina," Intriguing from beginning to end
","Wow, this is a film that has that Stanley Kubrick vibe going for it. But that wouldn't be fair for the director that directed this film. So I will say Alex Garland did a fantastic job combining technology with philosophy filled with tension and suspense. Sometimes there is jumbled philoshpy in a film that just doesn't connect well with the story and it seems like it's there just for the sake of it being there. Which makes the experience pretentious but it actually connects well with the story. And the imagery in this film, from the dancing female robot to the robotic parts really does give a lasting impression. In some way while watching this movie it reminded me of 'Ghost in the Shell' and that one video on youtube called 'Kara - Heavy Rain'. I actually wouldn't be shocked if Alex Garland got some of his ideas from 'Kara - Heavy Rain'. Films like this shows what effects and impact a film can have if the director has total control over his work. This film really delves on the idea of AI and thoughts, ideas and philosophy of how it would be like if AI took human form. Just about every interactions and discussions in this film is interesting. And the directions including the twist and turns is compelling. I was excited to learn more about what is going on and the ideas surrounding AI throughout this film. When it comes to the ending, it can be a hit or miss for some audiences. I personally thought it was a stand out ending and I was left satisfied. It's one of those endings where I was satisfied and yet wanted more. Which endings should be.8.3/10",8,1,5,22 May 2015
Back to the Future Part III," The conclusion to a fantastic trilogy
","Some critics seem to claim that this is their least favorite in the trilogy (which I could see why), however this is my personal second favorite. Yeah, this one probably has the least to do with time travel from the rest. And just seemed like an excuse to travel to the wild west era. However I just enjoyed the development and chemistry, although it does seem a bit rushed from time to time. The plot this time is simple and yet entertaining, it revolves around saving the Doc's life and making it back to present time. What this movie is, is a nice modern at least when this flick came out, homage to the western films, especially the ones with Clint Eastwood in it. I am pretty sure that this third installment was planned alongside part 2, because it does pick up nicely after the second installment and is simply interwoven well. The flaw is that the stakes just seemed weaker this time around and just lacked those clever moments that the first and second has. The simplicity is a nice touch, however I would have been nice if this had a bit more momentum going for it along the ride. Despite the cool way they decide to take Marty back to the future. The chemistry this time is at it's peak even if the development in certain areas like I said is weak and thus the interactions and how they deal with the environment Marty is in, is actually quite engrossing. Even if I just didn't like how the Doc starts to break all of his rules for time travel. All in all this installment is a worthy conclusion to a fantastic trilogy.8.3/10",8,3,5,28 May 2014
The Illusionist," Captivating story with a touch of magic
","This is a film about love and magic. The thing is the magic that is performed in this movie makes it seem like it's real magic and doesn't really give the benefit of the doubt for the audiences in the movie that watches the magician at work. Although most people don't believe in magic in real life and in this film, so they try their best in this story to doubt it as much as possible. When I first saw pictures of this film in a magazine hyping this film up, it worked for me I really liked the premise of it all which involves a magician. And especially because it has Edward Norton in it, who is one of my favorite actors. And for the most part it meet my expectations. This film is magnificent and mesmerizing at times, with a good amount of mystery behind it while it's played off very well. 2006 was really a good year for movies about magic, cause another magnificent film 'The Prestige' which was a real thrill ride. Ed Norton is magical and mysterious in a good way and Paul Giamatti put on a excellent performance playing the Chief Inspector. This film sort of feels like it moved along a bit slowly but it's still a captivating film with lovely story with a touch of magic.7.9/10",7,2,2,19 February 2011
Grudge Match," Rocky vs. Jake LaMotta
","Wow! This movie turned out to be a lot better than I thought. It has a fun and enthralling story, fun humor and good pacing. It's just entertaining from start to finish, there just wasn't a moment where I felt I was bored and even has heart to go with it. The plot is about a grudge match that takes place between ex-boxers after 30 yrs. Yeah, sure one fighter might be more likable than the other, but the other has a heartfelt backstory so it balances out. Sylvester Stallone basically plays Rocky Balboa and Robert De Niro basically plays his portrayal of Jake LaMotta. Overall I had a good time with this film and for the most part thoroughly enjoyed it. If you enjoyed this film, I recommend a Korean film called 'Crying Fist'.8.2/10",8,0,1,14 April 2014
Transformers," A pleasant surprise, it's a entertaining blockbuster popcorn flick with giant CGI robots
","When I first saw the trailer to this, I didn't know what to think but the premise was something new to me on the big screen so was sort of hyped for this movie. I don't know if it's because it's the first time I seen robots in great CGI beating the crap out of each other or something, but I had a entertaining time with this movie. The plot isn't anything amazing but it's passable and the build up was decent as well and the final battle in this flick was just awesome to watch. The human elements in this movie is pretty weak but it's bearable and it's alright to some degree. I didn't really like the clichÃ©s in this movie though. About the boy with the heart of gold that gets the hottest girl in school by doing something heroic. The humor in this is alright, not great but didn't bother me all that much although it felt a bit cheap. I know a lot of Transfomers fan will bash on this movie, but I will give my honest opinion. This movie was actually a quite entertaining movie, a good popcorn flick that the whole family will have a good time with. I kinda dislike it when people say 'it's the type of movie you will have to shut your brain off while watching in order to enjoy it' that usually means the story is a complete mess. In this case though it didn't get to the point of me getting so annoyed with it that I just wanted to see action every minute. Megan Fox is going to be exposed a lot more after this and I will just say it's not because of her acting. As for Shia LaBeouf, he was alright. Maybe it's because this is his first time being in this franchise, but didn't get all that tired of his character or was very annoyed by him. Overall this is a pretty darn good popcorn flick that just might be worth your time. It would have been better if some of the human bullcrap that was just there for humor and parts that was pointless to the story besides the action was cut out since the movie seemed a bit longer than it should be. But that is just a few negatives in my opinion. I give this movie a 7.8 for being entertaining, it would have been better if the robots at least got some more development cause you really don't care who gets destroyed. This movie is a pleasant surprise.7.8/10",7,0,1,2 July 2011
Pawn Sacrifice," Simple and yet gets the job done
","There has been many sports movies and such so it was actually kind of refreshing to watch a movie about a chess prodigy. Although it lacks depths and layers to it, it gets the job done in a simple fashion. Although I do think a bit more depth to the story and a bit better writing could have done this movie more justice. However as it stands, it's a good movie with a decent build up and a somewhat thrilling tournament which involves two players, a board and pieces. So this is a film based on the life of Bobby Fischer who is portrayed as a impolite, arrogant and inconsiderate narcissist but was one hell of a chess player. Now I don't know how much of this is true in real life when it comes to the Bobby Fischer's characteristics. However I do give this film respect for it trying to stay close to the source material while portraying a flawed chess player. Who isn't super likable and is someone the audience would probably not like enough to care as much but empathize with despite his chess playing gift. I just don't like to give respect to someone just because they are really good at something. I respect people that has integrity and has a heart and kindness without any harmful motives, being really good at something is a bonus. But I do give credit where credit is do and Bobby Fischer did play one of the most important and greatest chess tournament during the 70's. And he is a legend when it comes to chess and was really good at thinking ahead and reading people. However he was a guy dealing with paranoia and even a bit of a spaz. However he is unpredictable, which probably played a factor in his playing style. Well at least how he was portrayed in this film. Like I said, I respect this film for trying to give a more realistic portrayal a very important chess game. Without it going in a overly dramatic and pretentious direction. Overall, this is a pretty decent watch, it wasn't anything mind-blowing or something that is impactful in a emotional level or anything like that. But it is a good watch and I thought Tobey Maguire put on a fairly good performance in this. And Liev Schreiber nails it once again as the opposing rival.7.1/10",7,1,4,23 February 2016
Men in Black II," More doesn't mean better for this sci-fi movie
","So almost everything about the MIB is explored in the first movie. And now what do they decide to do, add more absurdity for the sequel. Nothing about this sequel is memorable despite the bigger budget and better special effects. There is nothing special about this movie and is easily forgetful. This movie is just plain lazy and by throwing in a bunch of more aliens and absurdity they thought it would lead to a better movie. The previous MIB movie was absurd but it didn't go all that overboard with it but this does and not in a good way either. Now I like Tommy Lee Jones in this franchise but it would have been nice if Linda Fiorentino from the first movie played some part in this movie. But she is just mentioned and that is about it. It would have been nice to see a female sidekick at work or something. But replaced by a talking dog. The acting is also corny and so is the whole movie. If you want to see the MIB and other characters acting obnoxious and unprofessional with more aliens and better special effects that doesn't really go anywhere memorable or interesting this might be for you. Another words it's a pretty disappointing sci-fi sequel. Also the acting is very corny and 4.2/10",4,0,0,17 June 2012
Magic Mike XXL," 'Step Up: Road Trip with Male Strippers' edition.
","Now I didn't like the first 'Magic Mike' movie all that much. And thought the main originality when it comes to the plot is how it revolved around male strippers. But that was about it, but at least it had a emotional storyline going for it that tied it together in a way where it was coherent. And I actually understood the emotions behind the characters and what they were dealing with. This time around, it just goes in a very silly direction. Watching this movie was like watching a bizarre movie with bizarre characters, which I gotta admit was intriguing at first. But this movie is like another 'Step Up' movie road trip edition with male strippers. And that basically sums this movie up. It's like 'Grand Theft Auto' except it's focused on male strippers. Which means the characters have to take on one mission after another to get the the main mission. So yeah, it's like watching a video game that revolves around male strippers. The trailer is better than this movie itself and even the trailer didn't really excite me. Who knows maybe I am being a bit biased since it's about male strippers and what they really want to do with their lives while on the same mission. Maybe if it was about female strippers I might have given it a slightly higher score. Overall, this is a movie that most girls will like if they want to see Channing Tatum dance and show off his butt. And see other muscular guys dancing almost naked. And maybe some straight guys will probably like it as well, I just isn't one of them.4.8/10",4,1,2,2 September 2015
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Imaginative and entertaining film
","When I first saw the trailer to this, I thought it wasn't going to be very good. But after viewing it, it was actually a lot of fun. And I gotta say, if your going to see it, go watch it in 3D to get the full effects. Just leave all the reality stuff out of your head and just accept the movie for what it is, I mean it's a 3D animated film for crying out loud. Children will love the heck out of this movie and adults will enjoy it as well, I thoroughly enjoyed the creativity that went into this myself. Some scenes are just so damn cool to watch in 3D that after the film was finished I actually wanted to see it again. It's a fantastic film and I hope everyone enjoyed it on the big screen in 3D.8/10",8,1,2,17 February 2010
Lincoln," I can understand how some people would find this movie boring...It's still a good film.
","Now I can completely understand how some audiences was bored to tears while watching this movie and I can understand how some audiences actually enjoyed this movie for what it is. It's kinda like the movie 'Citizen Kane' how it can come off as a boring movie but you might have to ponder upon it to appreciate it. If your expecting some good amount of action you will be very disappointed. Since this movie is just filled with dialogue that inspires but mainly it's the performances and the cinematography/production is what drives this movie. Steven Spielberg is one heck of a director and this is hands down a very well directed movie. The cinematography with the backgrounds and costumes makes it kinda seem your with the characters as they tried to get the 13th amendment passed. In fact this whole movie isn't a biography of Lincoln but about a big part of his life. When him and some of the members of his cabinet tries to push for the 13th amendment to get passed. I will admit for some parts of this movie I was bored but it did have it's moments, actually it had a lot of them. Although I was bored during some parts of this movie. As it progresses I started to get more immersed into what was going on. And even though most audiences will know how everything goes down there is a bit of tension and that is fine directing. All the cast did a amazing job with there roles which is the main part of this movie and it would take way too long to type all the positive things about there performances. But since Daniel Day-Lewis plays Abraham Lincoln...He was just perfect for this role, especially with his soft spoken manner in this. Since that is how I pictured Lincoln to talk like, cause sometimes the soft spoken manner is more effective than talking with a booming dominant voice. Although it can be effective as well sometimes like when it came to Thaddeus Stevens(Tommy Lee Jones). And although I like Liam Neeson, I am glad Daniel got this role and he most definitely deserve awards for this performance. It would have been a huge waste if this movie was not made because of Daniel Day-Lewis. And I give respect to Steven Spielberg for at least trying to stay in touch with history instead of throwing a whole bunch of stuff that didn't even happen. At first I was gonna give this movie a 7.4 but after pondering about it I personally think this movie deserves an 8/10.8/108/10",8,1,3,13 December 2012
Million Dollar Baby," Sports fan or not, check this film out
","This is one of the best boxing movies every made, heck it's one of the best sports movie I ever seen. The acting, the plot, the cinematography, almost everything was done really great and it got my attention from beginning to end. I especially loved watching the humanism in this movie and all the emotions, because the acting is just top notch. This is a story about a poor southern girl who wants to enter the boxing world and with hard work gets her coach played by Clint Eastwood who becomes her mentor and becomes a father figure, kinda like the only family she ever had. And as time goes by her game and skill improves. It's inspiring and yet depressing film that is most definitely a classic. Didn't even know of Hilary Swank but she puts on a amazing performance and she is going to go far in the movie industry, this movie is so good it basically made her. It really is a memorable film that is most definitely worth checking out, sports fan or not.9.5/10",9,2,3,21 September 2010

The team up, partnership is a bit awkward but it works and just like I said invigorating to watch. Also the detective elements is cleverly constructed, and it makes you feel like a detective while watching to a degree. And I especially liked the raw aspect of things in this movie and made me personally care about what was going on. The acting is good as well as the cinematography. So yeah, just about everything about the plot to the characters was interesting and fun to watch. It's a very well constructed mystery/thriller that is worth watching and will keep you interested from beginning to end.8.2/10",8,0,0,22 October 2014
Big Hero 6," Watchable but just didn't seem all that special
","Watching this movie felt like a walk through memory lane when it comes to childhood Saturday morning cartoon written all over it. Except with a way bigger budget and cool CGI animation. I got to admit what first got my attention, is the fact that this is the first Disney animation based on a Marvel. The message of this movie I guess can work for some and not for others in my opinion. Maybe audiences that has gone through vengeful hatred could either agree or disagree with the main message of this movie. I noticed that there was slight elementent of Japanese anime in this movie as well. Which can work for some and not really for others who want to see a straight Disney style animation. What is lacking however is that I couldn't really get attached to the characters or the story. Mainly because of the generic and clichÃ© direction of it all. And I just wasn't excited or felt like watching this one again. Really nice animation though and it will dazzle the kids.7/10",7,1,33,16 January 2015
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Ridiculous and stupid, while trying to be serious
","This is a really silly zombie flick that tries to be serious for the most part. Much more silly than the first movie in this series and there is way more plot holes, with more corny kung fu fighting. Yeah there is more action in this one compared to the previous one, but doesn't have hardly any of the survival horror elements like the first one and the plot is just stupid. Yeah it has Jill Valentine walking through dark corridors and checking rooms, but that is about it. The only positive thing I can say about this sequel is how it's dumb to the point it is sometimes more entertaining for few parts compared to the first one. And showing two girls with guns in the first one was hot, but it's a bit more hot in this one because of Sienna Guillory who plays Jill Valentine who is one of the characters from the actual video games. And how it has a little bit of the similar aspects to Resident Evil 3 Nemesis. The plot is very simple, a group of people are trying to escape Raccoon City after a infection spread that turn the civilians into zombies, and zombies aren't the only thing they have to watch out for a giant monster nemesis and a nuke that is planned to blow up the whole city is on there way. As silly as it is, Alice this time around has special abilities from getting injected by the T-Virus instead of turning into a zombie herself. The side characters are way much more annoying this time around, you know those morons that doesn't stick with the group and goes 'I can't take it anymore' and tries to leave where it's safe and gets the whole group into trouble. The plot this time around also almost has nothing to do with the game, same can be said about the future installments of this movie series. The first movie also had a lot of silly techno and rock action, but this one overdose that as well. Sure the creators try to add a lot of cool action sequences into this, but almost nothing about it makes sense at all.5.2/10",5,2,4,11 September 2010
Dumb and Dumber," Don't watch the extended version, the cuts happened for a reason
","I thought this was one of the funniest comedy movie of all time when it first came out. It's a bit outdated now and just not as funny as I remembered it. But it still works and the dumb elements didn't really get to the point where it's more annoying than it actually being funny. Jim Carrey gags are getting old now, but I could tell why it was such a hit back in the 90's. This has got to be one of the best duo to be in a comedy flick. If you like immature and yet at least somewhat amusing comedy, this one is most definitely worth a watch. While watching this for the 3rd time after a long period of not seeing it. I got a few chuckles out of it, but didn't find it all that funny. But I give credit for the comedic value when it first came out. I mean that laxative joke has been used over and over again after this movie. I am not sure if they are the pioneers of that joke, but they sure made it a hit in comedy flick to come afterwards. This is most definitely one of the movies that kick started Jim Carrey's career.7.2/10",7,4,6,8 January 2015
Brave," Not bad but not great either for a Pixar movie
","By just the trailer alone it seemed like a predictable movie about a tomboyish princess that wants to do warrior stuff. Like shooting arrows and fighting with swords and will play a key role in defeating a villain that pose a threat to the kingdom...well it goes in a bit of a different direction. More of a family moral message kinda deal but it just didn't seem all that effective or entertaining for that matter. As a CGI animated movie it's alright but for a Pixar movie, maybe it's because of the expectation. But this was kinda disappointing to the point it's sorta forgettable movie and can bore younger audiences and might no appeal to them much. Since the message for this flick seems a bit forced at times, while lacking the sentimental entertainment value. Not much about this movie stands out and it really is a forgettable movie. Not bad, but for a Pixar movie it isn't great either.6/10",6,1,3,25 October 2012
Guardians of the Galaxy," Entertaining flick that borrows elements from other sci-fi crew movies
","There seems to be a lot of hype going for this movie. I personally thought it was a good movie, but also thought it was a bit overrated. Some even claim this is the best Marvel movie so far...I have to disagree with that one. However this combines well developed character for a movie of this sort, that is incorporated well into the comic book, story-wise. This movie actually give all the main character in the crew to shine, which just doesn't applies to a lot of movies of this sort *cough* 'The Expendables'. So when it comes down to it the build up of the main team and how they get together and become a team is done well and I actually was interested in all the members of the crew, especially when it came to Rocket and Peter Quill. The action sequences are done well, nothing that I found to be groundbreaking, but it didn't seem mindless like 'Transformers: Age of Extinction'. Overall this is entertaining flick that combines elements from other sci-fi movies that deals with crew members and it's done well. Overall this is a good popcorn flick that is worth checking out.7.9/10",7,1,4,17 August 2014
Evil Dead," Not a worthy remake
","Usually good or even great remakes go in a different direction but has certain similarities to the point you can call it a remake but better or at least as good or even near good. Or go in a similar direction but has it's own flare for it to be worth a remake. But that really isn't the case for this one. All of the characters in this combined just couldn't replace Bruce Campbell as Ash. And never felt even remotely attached to any of them. It's 2013 and it there is better technology to make things appear real. And although the original 'Evil Dead 1 and 2' lacked the technology and looks fake in certain areas. It's just a more scary and suspenseful movie, plus it's even creepy and has uncomfortable dark humor to go with it. This remake lacks everyone of these elements. Sure it has more graphic imagery that is cringe worthy and I did cringe during few scenes. Although I have seen even more graphic movies before. But I never felt like I was entertained or scared. And I do think this movie's tagline is false, it's just isn't all that terrifying. The beginning few minutes starts out well and eerie but it quickly becomes dull. I just don't get the constant positive reviews this movie is getting. It's actually somewhat of a hit at box office so there will be a sequel but currently just isn't interested or hyped for it. I think I rather re-watch the whole original 'Evil Dead' trilogy. Or just re-watch 'The Cabin in the Woods' which the makers of this movie was probably inspired by because of it's success. Although 'The Cabin in the Woods' was inspired by many many different horror movies. The thing is Sam Raimi actually help produce this movie and it is still a let down. Some things don't even make much sense near the end of the movie either.4.6/10",4,52,103,8 April 2013
The Imitation Game," 'Sometimes it's the very people who know and imagines anything of, who do the things that no one can imagine'
","This is a very entertaining, compelling and impactful movie that is based on a true story. There has been quite a lot of war movies where soldiers fight with weapons to win battles and such. So it's refreshing to see a group of nerds, using there brains to save lives. Now I really enjoy stories where a group of interesting people with special set of skills come together as a team to pursue the same goal. Except this time it's a group of code breakers trying to decyper the Nazis code of communication called Enigma during World War 2. The plot which is based on a true story is very well put together. And that includes Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) past and where he comes from. Now portraying a characters past can sometimes make the movie drag, but in this it actually adds to the movie and helps it lead to a more impactful ending. There is quite a bit of depth to this movie without it going all over the place or it being overly convoluted. Benedict Cumberbatch was just phenomenal playing Alan Turing. Which shows that you don't necessarily have to look like a real life person to make the character believable. Matthew Goode was sharp and sturdy as Hugh Alexander. And Keira Knightley fit her role really well as Joan Clarke and the chemistry between her and Alan really added a sense of humanity to the plot. This sort of reminded me of 'Valkyrie' which is another film based on a true story about heroic people that did there best to try and stop Hitler and his plans. Except I felt more emotion with this one because of the way it was executed. Overall, this is a film that I would highly recommend to anyone. I say full price.9/10",9,0,2,30 May 2015
The Evil Dead," High achievement!
","This is a bizarre, crazy, scary, creepy and even humorous horror film that was highly original when it came out. It's not just another cabin in the woods horror film with slasher stuff going on but more. With the very small resources they had this is actually a really cool achievement. As a matter of fact this is sort of like a student film in a way...Well somewhat. And Sam Raimi breakthrough film or maybe that is 'Evil Dead 2'? Anyways this is a cult classic horror movie that is most definitely worth checking out for cult horror film fans. Or horror fans in general, it just still holds up today and the old cinematography adds to the eerie and crazy vibe. Choosing Bruce Campbell to play the main protagonist Ash Williams was a excellent idea. He brings out the amusement in this movie with his crazy facial expressions and the way he gives his dialogue really adds to the humor. He is just a goofy but cool character. This is a horror classic that shouldn't be passed on.7.6/10",7,1,3,7 May 2013
Shrek 2," Solid CGI animated sequel but still liked the first one better
","This is a good sequel but I still liked the first one better. It seems a lot of critics seem to like this more than the first 'Shrek', I mean it has some aspects that are better. But overall I thought the first one was better. It has more emotion, more stuff going on and more characters but the first one just had that more engaging and entertaining aspect to it. I however really liked it involves the fairy tale characters more this time compared to the first one. There is humor in this as well with it's double meanings and such, but it was just more effective in the original. Lastly Puss in Boots is a great addition to this sequel.7.8/10",Null,0,1,17 August 2011
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Stylized violence and it works
","The first vol in Kill Bill, is basically a stylized violence with a mix of many styles Tarantino is inspired by. But it's still well crafted although it doesn't have much substance and the dialogue isn't THAT great, which Tarantino films are known for. It also follows Tarantino's trademark of not going in the chronological order, which makes the film better because it gets more anticipating to find out how Uma Thurman's character got to those points. The first vol starts out with a bang, literally and metaphorically, it's action packed with a lot of blood and fighting, mainly in order to get the audiences attention. I also liked the mix of Asian cinema style in this, but gives it his own style a bit. The visual and the style is the main highlight of this movie, and it's mainly the reason I enjoyed this movie. Not one of my favorite Tarantino movie, but it's still a pretty good vengeance film.8/10",8,1,3,8 September 2010
Saw II," The sequel that made the 'Saw' franchise popular
","This is a satisfying and worthy sequel from the first, as a matter of fact this one is more entertaining than the first 'Saw' and even has a better twist in store. This time it has more characters that are trying to survive in some mansion where they can't escape and to top it off they have poison running through there bodies and the main part of the game is to get the antidotes by playing a game that has some bloodshed to go with it. The death were actually cool and there is more at stake compared to part 1, the puzzles are a lot more elaborate as well. I especially liked the conversation between Eric Mathews a cop and Jigsaw himself, cause you get to learn more about Jigsaws motives and what makes him tick, also some of the stuff Eric Mathews says to Jigsaw actually makes sense in a debating kind of way. The main disappointment of this film is that the characters make some really dumb decisions that don't make any sense. And they spend more time arguing and yelling at one another than actually trying to beat the game. Personally I am in between Jigsaw's motives, I think some people deserve to be part of his game and some don't, but I really don't think he should be the one to test the worth of human lives, just cause he got screwed himself plus he is an old fart so it's natural his time should be coming to an end. But some of his victims you can't help but feel they deserved it. Especially when most of them in this film is actually pretty stupid, I especially disliked the character Erik Knudsen played, his role was the son of Eric Matthews. Not only did he have a douche face, but there was just something about him that I really didn't like. He even tries to hit on a girl by trying to act like he cares for her while thinking he just might have a chance with her, some might disagree but it's actually quite obvious. He is also bratty and annoying and you want him to die in the most painful manner possible, even if they don't really portray him as the bad guy. I also didn't like the fact that you don't get to see every one of Jigsaw's puzzles that is set before each of the victims. Anyways this is not a scarier film compared to the first but it is more shocking and cringe-inducing, while being entertaining at the same time. I personally think it's better than part 1.8/10",8,0,1,27 October 2009
Ip Man," Fight sequences was entertaining to watch from beginning to end
","I didn't even know who Ip Man was, but after finding out he was Bruce Lee's master I decided to check this movie out. It's was a pretty good martial arts flick with some pretty good fighting sequences. The scene that really stood out the most though is when Ip Man fights 10 black belts at once, although the other fight scenes didn't really stand out much to me. Maybe cause I seen to many kung fu flicks but it was still pretty entertaining to watch. The story isn't amazing or anything but it's passable, just basically about Ip Man fighting his challengers who are also pretty good martial artists and soon ends up fighting japs that wants and does occupy china. I liked how the story moved evenly paced and watching Donnie Yen(Ip Man) fight using wing chun was really cool for the most part. Although a lot of the stuff that happens is fictional in this movie, it's a movie that is still worth checking out especially for kung fu and wing chun fans.7.3/10",7,0,1,5 January 2011
Here Comes the Boom," Predictable but a alright watch
","If you see the trailer it's very obvious and predictable how it's going to all play out. It's a decent movie but if the build up was a bit better and had more inspiring and bonding elements going for it. The finale would have stood out more. The story is about a high school teacher named Scott Voss played by Kevin James. Who usually gets these likable character that has a good heart. In this he is basically a lazy nice guy practically. And when the school is having budget cuts and laying off good teachers. He decides to find a way to raise the money and to impress another teacher that he has the hots for. And to raise the money he decides to fight in MMA tournaments. So it goes in a predictable direction of him training, getting better at what he does, building a reputation and inspiring his students. Now this is a fast paced movie and the development isn't done all that well to the point it leaves a big impact at the end. Bas Rutten is also in this as Voss's trainer and he is great in this.5/10",5,6,11,6 March 2013
Clash of the Titans," Linear and nothing special
","Okay so this is a movie about Greek mythology and a very shallow and narrow one at that. To put it simply this movie pretty much sucks, there is almost nothing special about this movie and almost nothing stands out. The plot is very narrow and simple, sort of like going from point A to point B but there is nothing really imaginative or creative or even entertaining about it. The actor Sam Worthington came out of nowhere and was in 'Terminator Salvation', 'Avatar' and now this. And I guess Hollywood is trying to sell him off as the next big thing but he just plays a boring and generic character in everything I saw in him so far, which is few but still. If this was a video game cut-scene it might be somewhat forgivable but it's not. In fact watching the video game 'God of War' is more entertaining than this. The CGI is alright but nothing all that special and same elements has been done before and can get kinda crappy sometimes for a movie that was released in 2010. The movie is about a half human half god guy named Perseus(Same Worthington) rising up against the gods. Liam Neeson looks the part and fits Zeus very well but his character is easily manipulated. The gods in this movie just seem pretty weak mentally and there powers seem far from being omnipotent. But some parts in the Greek mythology is like this but it gets sort of awkward in a negative way because the gods in this seem too human sometimes. Ralph Fiennes plays Hades who is sort of the opposite of Zeus in some ways. Which is interesting because the last time these two actors played opposites in the same movie was in 'Schindler's List'. One aspect I liked about this movie though personally is how it shows how arrogance can lead to downfall including when it comes to the mortals. I also find it interesting how Luke Evans who plays Apollo in this will play Zeus in 'Immortals'. For marketing reason this film goes 3D as well at last minute and the outcome isn't very good. I haven't seen the original but I have a feeling that it must be better than this. The man build up is for the Kraken and even that was disappointing, it's very short and it's nowhere close to a epic fight. Hollywood does a good job of making the trailers way more epic than the movie itself and that applies this.3.6/10",3,0,0,4 June 2012
Jurassic World," I highly recommend watching this movie in 4D
","Despite this film lacking the in depth human elements and depth to decisions and consequences when it comes to natural order of things. This was still a super fun filled, exciting ride from start to finish. If you are going to watch this movie, I highly recommend you check it out in 4D. The story interwoven with the action scenes is done pretty well and the bickering between characters wasn't all that annoying either. It compacted a lot of cool elements in this movie, it's like they threw everything they got for this production. It even has an Asian Stever Jobs in this film. Just when you think it couldn't get anymore cooler, they throw in something ridiculous but exciting surprise at the audiences. The special effects are top notch in this, and it really shows how much innovation when it came to the CGI it has come compared to the first film in this franchise. Yeah, this seems more like a monster movie than a dinosaur crisis movie, but it has enough exciting and tension like sequences to the point it really doesn't matter all that much. Maybe it's because I saw this film in 4D, but I enjoyed this film way more than I thought I would.8/10",8,9,26,19 July 2015
Paranormal Activity," Yeah it was made with basically a shoestring budget but that still doesn't make a great horror movie
","My friend really liked this movie but I just can't understand how anyone can find this movie to be a great horror flick. My friends constant remark was that this movie was made with basically a shoe string budget and that is goes in a direction that it's somewhat believable. Yeah this movie is made with basically a shoestring budget but I didn't find the premise believable at all and seemed like it was trying a bit too hard to make it seem like it's all real. With constant dry interactions with characters that will bore you to tears. And seriously where does the creepy music come from in the movie anyways if this movie is suppose to go in a realistic direction. Like everything in this movie actually happened. In a way this movie is worse than the 'The Blair Witch Project'. Now I know this movie at least has something going on but I found how the characters try to investigate what is going on when crazy stuff happens in the house to be funny and ridiculous. It would have been more entertaining to be with a couple of friends and talk about ghosts and supernatural stuff than to watch this movie. Because that is basically all they do in this movie, constantly going on and on talking about supernatural stuff and weird noises going on later on. So yeah just talk about ghost stories for a while yourself and couple of other people and than go hide and smack pots and pans and that sums up this movie. The movie isn't even original this premise with the videotaping of what is going on while the characters knowing they are being videotaped has been done before. The trailer to this movie is unbelievable at how it tries to sell itself as being the scariest movie ever made. Cause it's not, actually it's far from it, in fact it's more boring than actually scary. The movie even lacks tension and it's composed of mainly two boring than real life characters. It's just sad to see how this movie became notorious and actually a hit in theaters when it came out. I am just glad I didn't see this in theater and just saw it with a couple of friends on a television screen. I give this movie a 3.6 cause there is at least something to talk about or even laugh a bit while watching this with other people on TV although the movie itself is bland, dry and not scary. I heard even the audiences that did see this in theater was rolling there eyes after cause they felt cheated. It would have been somewhat watchable if the characters weren't so bland and was actually relatable and if the direction wasn't so predictable.3.9/10",3,5,9,24 October 2011
Mission: Impossible II," Lacked the spy thriller aspect and added more gunplay but just doesn't really work
","The first movie I gotta admit you can sort of just go with it. But the mission was impossible and not because of the difficulty of the mission. But because of how the implausible a lot of stuff that happens in it, including the plot holes. But it was overall a solid spy thriller for the most part. This movie tries to add spy elements into the movie but the mission this time isn't very cleverly crafted. And comes off as a kung-fu shoot em up movie with bunch of stylish gunplay thrown in. The movie just comes off as some dude with long hair and sunglasses doing crazy gun stunts while wearing a leather jacket and driving a motorcycle. Some Asians deem this as cool, but it's just a bit too overused. Even the character Ethan Hunt isn't as likable as he was in the first movie and seemed to be trying a bit too hard to seem like a super cool spy while taking out the realism behind his character. I am not one of those reviewers that bash on a movie for how unrealistic a movie is, but the premise and direction of this movie makes it a movie that should have tried a bit more to be believable. Also despite few of the characters that was in the first movie, this one seems really unrelated to the previous movie. It just seemed gimmicky and lame, especially near the end. This mostly goes in a direction where you hardly have to use your brain and think things through and just comes off as a pretty narrow story. I will admit though some of the stylish action sequences was pretty cool but that is basically the only good think I can say about this movie. The face mask disguise also played a crucial role in the previous movie without it being gimmicky or cheap with it's uses. But that isn't the same for this flick. Sometimes the exaggerated and even ridiculous gunplay works in certain movies but that just isn't the case for this sequel. Yeah, I can constantly just bash this sequel, but since it does have it's moments although very few. I will give this movie a 5.8/10. Some reviewers claim the first hour of this movie was good but loses it's edge afterwards, but I am going to have to disagree. The redeeming thing about this movie is the action near the end. Although it's ridiculous when it comes to the action and doesn't really fit quite well with the tone of the first half of this movie. The action sequences near the end is pretty cool on couple of parts but mostly gimmicky. So yeah a lot of the action doesn't work as a whole for the movie but if you separate the two it becomes sort of tolerable. I also liked the music which was a plus, especially during the action sequences.5.8/10",Null,0,1,8 November 2011
The Adjustment Bureau," Interesting premise with a good blend of sci-fi and romance
","I really didn't have high expectations for this movie when I saw the trailer, but after seeing it I can now say it really did beat my expectations. It's a clever sci-fi romance/thriller that is crafted very well and intrigued me throughout the whole movie. It sort of reminded me of movies like 'The Butterfly Effect' and 'Inception' a bit, but I personally liked this movie a bit more than 'The Butterfly Effect'. The movie is about trying to outrun fate or predestination and also makes you think more about freewill and also has elements of love and has a perfect blend of sci-fi and romance. The vibe and style has been done before especially in other sci-fi movies, but the direction of it all makes it worth while. The lighthearted aspect of this movie is done right for a serious tone movie and I didn't really like Matt Damon as a actor all that much but I enjoyed his performance in this. His character was very likable and a ideal politician in this movie. There is few parts that doesn't make sense, but overall the premise is mostly cleverly done. Now I never read 'Adjustment Team' by Philip K. Dick this movie is adapted from, but judging by the film itself I really enjoyed it and seemed like a very good adaptation. There is some parts that seem to drag on sometimes and a bit slow. But overall almost everything in this movie works and has a perfect blend of two main elements. If your looking for tension you might be disappointed, because the Adjustment Bureau isn't very intimidating in this and you will see why. Despite some flaws, it's still a intriguing movie done right and to anyone who is looking for a good date movie, this one is worth checking out there is something for everyone.8.3/10",8,3,5,5 March 2011
World Trade Center," A very small part
","This film was a total disappointment. It went in a pretty decent direction at first, and than we have to see 2 guys in a freaking hole the rest of the movie. I am sure the audiences wanted to see a lot of things that happened during the event of 9/11 but you don't get that at all. You basically get a little piece of the big picture. It felt like the film was made to strike into the inner emotions of people to trick them into seeing this dull film with two guys talking about painfully boring stuff. I am not a fan of Oliver Stone and think he is a boring director with no soul, but this is taking to another level of boredom. This felt like a waste of time, when I am pretty sure the audience wanted to see more depth in the incident. Some may like it and cry for it, but most importantly buy this drivel, cause they may think it's the right thing to do. The only thing this film did was it got people emotional since it's a event that a lot of people feel close to. It was in no way a compelling film. I give it a 4 out of 10 since I have seen worst films. Now some over the top patriotic people or rednecks that maybe reading this may bash on me and say stuff along the lines of 'You hate America!' nope, I feel bad for the victims and respect the people that tried to save lives during the incident, I just hate bad film making. Now I give this film a 4 out of some patriotism cause I personally think the film deserves a lower score.4/10",4,0,1,22 October 2009
Black Snake Moan," Samuel L. Jackson's best performance in years
","It's a shame this film didn't do so well at box office, I can see why. But it's still a good film. I liked the movie 'Hustle and Flow' so I decided to check this film out which is done by the same director. The plot is about a girl Rae(Christina Ricci) who is a broken down girl and doesn't give 2 cents about herself, mainly cause of past and just goes around sleeping with anyone. And Lazarus(Samuel L. Jackson) is a preachy kinda guy that tries to get Rae's life back together. Samuel L. Jackson put on a excellent performance in this film and he really did impress me a lot, probably his best performance in years. His character was detailed and complex in a way that really does draws in the audience's attention. Justin Timberlake, plays Rae's boyfriend who goes into the military, he acting was okay for a pop idol, I guess. If you enjoyed 'Hustle and Flow' you just might enjoy this film as well.8/10",8,0,2,15 January 2010
The Hangover Part II," Basically a below average rehash than a good comedic sequel
","The buddies take a while to get together while constantly talking about what happened in the previous movie. And not just join together in a quick but fluid manner. Plus the characters just isn't as likable this time around. This movie is basically a rehash of the first movie, but the first one was more fluid when it came to it's comedic elements and more entertaining. This one just seemed to be trying a bit too hard because the first one was such a success. It was like the movie was trying to make the scenarios cool but it just lacked in it's comedic value. The situation and everything just seemed way too over exaggerated and it goes in a direction where it's difficult to just go with the flow. The only big originality is that the pack is now in Bangkok but even than it doesn't give anything all that new or all that funny. If this movie came before the original I am not sure if this franchise would have been a hit. I was continuously waiting for this movie to be at least a good comedy but it just never really reached that level. It just seemed like they didn't have a clever direction or a good comedic plot but just wanted to cash in as soon as possible. It does have it's moments but it's very few and nothing that really stands out. This so called sequel isn't terrible but it was still disappointing.5.8/10",Null,0,0,7 November 2011
Prisoners," Well didn't see that coming!
","This is a thrilling and suspenseful movie that got me focused just about all the way through. It's just one of those movies that starts off slow but it gradually builds and builds. It just kept me on the edge and really immersed into what was going on. The twist and turns are just superbly written. I just didn't see it coming, but when it does it's just crazy in a good way. Hugh Jackman has shown his rage in previous roles, but he goes all out in this one. In fact all the actors and actresses did a great job. Although Jake Gyllenhaal plays a similar detective character as in 'Zodiac'. Overall this is one of the most tense, suspenseful and very well written movie I have seen all year. With a satisfying climax.8.7/10",8,1,2,30 December 2013
Avengers: Age of Ultron," More of a hit than a miss!
","This is one of those movies that actually met my expectations. It's probably the best action movie of 2015 so far. And when I say action for this movie, there is LOTS and LOTS of action. I can't say it's the best superheroes movie so far, but it takes the cake when it comes to the most action sequences so far. Joss Whedon really wanted to deliver to the comic book fans the super action piled upon action superheroes experience. Plus this probably has the biggest budget for a superheroes movie so far, so for the most part it delivers. Although the action sort of feels tiresome after a while, since like I said it's action after action. Without it giving a breather, except that very slow moving middle section. Tony Stark/Iron Man is once again the main main character this time around once again. Not in the level of Wolverine to the X-Men but most of the story revolves around him. Even if there is a reason for that, it goes in a direction where he is the key player. While Captain America seemed to not have that many good parts as the leader and the master tactitician of the team. Instead Joss Whedon takes some pokes at him a bit. I don't like to come up with assumptions, but I guess that has to do with the fact that Cap is a Christian and Tony is an atheist. Plus Tony has that enticing and flashy image going for him, which is a super plus when it comes to the media. And no I am not a fan of Captain America, although I want him to win in the Civil War movie against Iron Man. I think Joss Whedon did the best he could to give each team members a bit of screen time and few moments to shine. There is a lot of grandscale action sequences but like I said it gets tiresome after a while, most of the audience in the theater seemed numb after a while. When it comes to fights though, I personally thought Hulk vs. Hulkbuster was the highlight. It really wasn't a necessary fight and the plot could have moved along without it. But I can't complain because it was just badass. The action sequences does seem to have some editing problems when the action gets too chaotic. The plot was hit and miss with it mostly being a hit. Going in a slightly more complex direction may seem like a good idea, but it doesn't really work this time around because at it's core it's still a very simple story. The plot is basically by the numbers and didn't seem to flow very naturally, but that is only a very small gripe. There was this one part where the Korean audiences geeked out. The thing about Korean audiences is that they are usually very respectful and mostly very quite during an event, such as watching a movie. But they geeked out in one or two parts. Personally I like to go to a packed theater, where you can be in the moment and enjoy the reactions from other audiences. And I don't mean being rude, like constantly having a conversation or texting away (which is something you will not see amongst Korean audiences in theaters in Korea). But being able to enjoy the moment and show what appeals to our senses is one of the benefits of going to a theater in my opinion. Overall this will be one of the biggest and grandscale blockbuster popcorn flick for year 2015. So yeah, take some friends and family, have a blast. I will say that some of the cast is getting a bit old to play these parts in my opinion. With Captain America and Thor in the safe zone for now, but they are also the most vulnerable when it comes to playing these roles, because their physicality and image means everything for those characters. Not hating or anything, it's just the natural order of things. No one can stay on top forever.8/10",8,6,18,28 April 2015
Hotel Transylvania," Creative scenarios and backgrou is what drives this flick
","This is a fun animated comedy that the whole family can enjoy on Halloween. Yeah it lacks substance when it comes to the plot. But the creative animation sequences when it comes to the different monsters and certain scenarios sort of make up for it. The message of this movie at the end also has been done a bunch of times but it's alright. I was starting to have no good expectations for Adam Sandler movies but this one is good. And it would be cool if his movies start to improve, instead of dumb toilet humors that aren't clever or all that funny. It worked in a couple of his other movies but it's starting to deteriorate. Anyways Adam Sandler nailed it as the voice of a grumpy and yet likable vampire Dracula unlike Barnabas Collins(Johnny Depp). And the romance elements isn't developed enough including the relationships but certain scenes and wacky scenarios makes this movie watchable. The story is basically about Dracula who is owner of a hotel where all monsters gather to enjoy there time away from humans who they think of as a huge threat. And on this occasion to also celebrate his daughters 118th birthday, a daughter Dracula swore to protect from humans. And he throws these lame parties but the daughter wants to go out and see the world outside of the hotel. And when a human teen stumbles upon the hotel things go in a different direction from the generic monsters daily routine in the hotel. Although it lacks depth it's a fun animated movie that the whole family can enjoy on Halloween.7.4/10",7,2,5,24 December 2012
The Insider," Slow paced but gets engaging and even a bit heart-wrenching as it progresses
","I am not a big fan of Micheal Mann as a director but he made few great movies and this is one of them. Micheal Mann has a style of directing that influenced other directors and it really works in this movie. It's a shame that this movie faltered when it came to the box office earning when the movie itself beats most movies that are Hollywood. But when it comes to box office earnings it's like that for most of his movies. But in this case it's understandable because this isn't a movie of the mass audience although it's a good movie. Especially since you have to focus a lot to the dialogue in order to understand what is going on. Al Pacino is good in this but Russell Crowe is excellent for this role. This has a ambitious journalist/producer for CBS news Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino) going after Jeffrey Wigand(Russell Crowe) who is a man of integrity but works for major tobacco company as general manager but gets fired for big information that can be breaking news. And these vital information can help others in a positive manner. But he is under a confidential agreement which he tries to keep but is being pushed around to the point of breaking. In another words he is the insider of one of one of the biggest company. The execution of this movie is very well done although it takes patience to get use to and it's not a big shock that this movie was nominated for 7 Academy Award Nominations. However if your looking for a action thriller this movie will not be for you. But what this is, is a realistic and intelligent approach to a journalist and a insider with some excellent dialogue. This is what movies that deserve award nominations is about.7.9/10",7,0,2,5 March 2012

","There has been a lot of hype going for this movie before it was even released, especially with Heath Ledger's Joker. And this movie has met the hype and it exceeded my expectation and Heath Ledger's version of the Joker really delivered. In fact his character is the show stealer in this masterpiece. And is hands down one of the greatest villains to ever hit the movie screen. And this is a relief cause the ending for 'Batman Begins' kinda hyped Batman's new villain. Although Christopher Nolan does not plan ahead for sequels. It's just a shame that this was basically Heath's last performance, RIP Heath Ledger. I ain't even going to talk about the plot to this cause it's simply a masterpiece and will keep you on the edge of your seat. This movie is over 2 hours and 30 minutes but it feels way shorter and you just won't want this movie to end. Thanks to the tightly wrapped plot and Christopher Nolan's directing. While 'Batman Begins' is about the building up of Batman this is Batman at his peak and how he utilizes his every skill in order to try and stop a chaotic force. His style in this reminds me of the movie 'Heat', especially when it comes to the cinematography. And it really works for this movie and blends right in and gives it that more thrilling element. Christian Bale is a excellent Bruce Wayne. But the actor and character that isn't getting the recognition it deserves is Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent or Two Face. His performance was spot on and almost gets rid of that awful aftertaste from the Tommy Lee Jones version of Two Face from 'Batman Forever'. Anyways the Joker in this is a agent of chaos and he really does bring chaos to Gotham City. He is a insane ominous maniac and just so entertaining to watch, it's just so darn thrilling and engaging. The constant 'what is he going to do next?' is one aspect that drives this movie. It's just awesome that Batman's archenemy really really delivers in this movie, with the mannerism and demeanor. Everything is just spot on Joker with a bit of flare to it. There is debate going on who is the better Joker, Jack Nicholson or Heath Ledger's version. Personally I like Heath's version better but it's understandable when it comes to the audiences that like Jack's version better. This isn't just a superhero movie, this movie really does deserve awards. To the story to the acting and dialogue, to the cinematography and action everything is superb. This time the Batman fight sequences aren't choppy anymore and you can actually see what is going on. Katie Holmes for some reason thought it would be a better idea to be in 'Mad Money' a movie that nobody watched over this. And is now replaced by Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes. She may not really have the look but her acting chops are way better than Katie Holmes. Other small side characters such as Eric Roberts as Sal Maroni after the downfall of Falcone and Michael Jai white as Gamble did a good job as well, although there scenes are very small. There is also a character in the mob that looks like a less fat version of Flass but isn't. While 'Batman Begins' is a great superhero movie but it did slightly feel slow at times although very few. This movie overshadows 'Batman Begins' in a lot of areas. There isn't a single dull moment in this or any slow parts while showing a great crime/drama/action story. Also while 'Batman Begins' didn't really utilized Batman's detective skills, he uses some detective skills in this one. I really couldn't spot any flaws with this movie maybe very very very slightly. But still this is a masterpiece of a movie that shows how one of the world's coolest and notorious superhero faces a chaotic and ominous force such as the Joker. Like I said this movie might have slight flaws and slight plot holes but if I don't give this one a 10/10 I don't know what I will give it to.10/10",10,0,4,19 July 2012
Friends with Benefits," Starts off alright but ends up being something that is not anything special
","After watching the movie 'No String Attached' I wondered what would be different about this movie since both movies share similar premise. The dialogue goes in a direction where it tries a bit too hard to be hip. The movie starts out alright but it goes in a really clichÃ© direction after it makes fun to clichÃ© romantic comedies. What it does is bash on the old romantic comedies that goes in a clichÃ© direction but it copies all the recent romantic comedies. It seemed the two main characters tries to show off how laid back and cool they are, which gets sort of annoying after a while. There is just so many today's wannabe hip clichÃ© stuff crammed into this and it just doesn't seem all that natural. The chemistry between Justin Timberlake and Mila Kunis was not believable. I would have preferred Jessica Biel who didn't get the role because of Mila Kunis. Personally am not really a fan of Mila Kunis the chemistry just seemed weak. But tries to atone for it by putting a bunch of sex scenes in there. Personally I would have preferred Jessica Biel in those scenes.5.5/10",5,0,1,6 January 2012
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The franchise is becoming dark for the better
","A lot is changing as this franchise is progressing and for the most part for the better. Yeah the movies seem to be getting shorter and is starting to miss a lot more from the books. But there is better satire in this and it's not dull to sit through. I don't know if it's because of the passing of time, but the cinematography is getting a lot better and so is the acting. Not amazing acting but much better this time around. But most of all the franchise seems to becoming darker. What I also liked was how there is more wizards and witch battles this time around which lacked in the previous novels. And it's good to see that Harry is growing up and using magic to fight while teaching others to do the same and even getting a girl. The choices come in to play big time with characters that are good and characters that are presented bad or some even in the middle is starting to make important choices that can change there original characteristics and direction. Again the book is long and it's kinda disappointing how short the movie is, in fact it has the shortest running time in the franchise. Even thought he book is really long, it just seemed to be missing a lot from it. I know it's not possible to fit everything from the book into one movie, but could have fit a lot more. Anyways it seems the franchise overall is turning dark for the better.7.5/10",Null,0,2,20 July 2011
Green Street Hooligans," Toughening up and standing your ground
","Now after watching this movie I still think soccer or football hooligans are bogus and one of the most stupid groups of gangs. But this movie is still entertaining because of the gritty and realistic way they are portrayed and the street fight scenes are actually entertaining. This ain't no kung-fu choreographed style fighting either. Now when it comes to soccer/football hooligans they are just pointless and the less of the less in the gang world, at least some legit gangsters make profit although what they are doing is completely wrong. But even after watching this movie I don't see the motive in being a soccer/football hooligan except wanting to fit into a group. And act like bunch of tough guys, and that is what this movie is. Now the hooligans portrayed in this movie has balls, loyalty and companionship. But when it comes down to it, it's basically a big penis measuring competition but the direction it goes makes it entertaining although pointless. And some of the hooligans seem like losers and pointless, but also somewhat cool at the same time. Pete Dunham(Charlie Hunnam) comes to mind, Charlie Hunnam just gives off this badass vibe who is in a crappy group. He is a aggressive and rebellious character but he also has loyalty and morals. But he becomes a motorcycle gang member in 'Sons of Anarchy' TV show with his future role. And he actually plays a cool pretty boy in a group of somewhat intimidating motorcycle gang that actually has some motives. Matt Buckner(Elijah Wood) is in this and the guy is a complete pushover and most of the plot is about him toughening up bit by bit after joining the hooligans through Pete. And he played his character in a believable manner, he was just perfect for this role. And I totally bought into him starting out as a weak pushover to something else. Anyways if you want to watch a group of youngsters acting like wannabe badass in a entertaining manner with some gritty fight scenes this one just might be for you. Despite it revolving around hooligans it's actually pretty entertaining flick.6.8/10",6,0,0,8 July 2012
Toy Story," Pixar begins
","I recently went to see the double feature which included 'Toy Story' and 'Toy Story 2' and I don't know if it's the nostalgia kicking in but it was still quite fun. I mean it wasn't good as when I first saw it when it came out when I was in elementary school, but it was still pretty entertaining and brought back some memories. The animation was amazing, and phenomenal when it first came out and still holds up today. The voice actors even did a great job, Tom Hanks and Tim Allen did a great job with there performance in portraying Woody and Buzz Lightyear. It was a exciting adventure, although the plot was simple it was effective and entertaining.The story is about toys coming to life, but keeping themselves secret by acting like they aren't alive. But the toys coexist with humans peacefully, except the toys in Andy's room get worried on birthdays and Christmases of being replaced. Thus when Andy's favorite toy get replaced by a new favorite toy, the conflict starts from there when the older toy that was Andy's favorite tries to hide the new toy, but ends up hitting it out the window. Although this day and age, kid's who are about Andy' age probably won't play with the types of toys portrayed in the movie, and the magic was sort of lost from when I saw it when I was in elementary. This movie is still ahead of it's time, by a large margin.8.5/10",8,0,0,7 October 2009
Men in Black," One of my childhood sci-fi movie
","This is one of the most memorable sci-fi movies I have seen. It's nothing really epic per say, but the unique aspect of it all makes it stand out. Well at least when it came out. This movie had elements that hasn't been done before it and has a simple plot but it's interesting and engaging. Alien movies has been done countless times before but what makes this movie stand out is the investigative side of it. Instead of a one side fighting another in a constant battle. I first saw this movie during my childhood and thought it was the coolest thing ever and thought the soundtrack was so awesome. Even the Will Smith rap song that went with the movie during my childhood. The plot is about a group of special people that balance out the extraterrestrial life forms that are on earth and keep things secret for the rest of the world. And also wipe out aliens that are a threat to the planet earth. As the movie progresses you learn more about how the MIB work through the eyes of agent J(Will Smith) who is a new recruit. Who does a great job with his role while adding a bit of humor into the mix. Agent K(Tommy Lee Jone) is the really serious one of the two and takes his job very very seriously and is always serious. But the pair works well in this movie. Overall this is a fun sci-fi movie that doesn't take itself too seriously and for the most part it works.7.8/10",7,1,1,17 June 2012
The Graduate," Outdated but still a bit of a classic erotic classic
","This movie has gotten some good reviews and for good reasons. Movies like this shows that you don't need high budget or lots of actions to be enthralling and entertaining. Although it's a bit of a erotic comedy, except with a bit more erotic parts but doesn't go over the top with it. This movie is basically about a graduate that has a bit of anxiety played by Dustin Hoffman who is a bit confused and not all that happy and a bit disappointed about graduating although the people around him constantly congratulate him. Anyways his dad's business partner's wife Mrs. Robinson tries to seduce Hoffman's character and things lead to something more when Mrs. Robinson's daughter Elaine gets in the picture. I first thought this was going to be a very serious or weird drama, yes it's a bit weird but it turned out to be a bit of a light and yet erotic comedy. It's interesting to see young Hoffman in situations like this, especially since the premise takes place in the 60's which is an era I didn't grow up in. Although these types of movies seem to be constant now a days, but this movie gives off a feel of originality although it might be because it came out in the late 60's. This movie is very far when it comes to this type of genre and has been done really good afterwards as well. For it's time it really does make it a bit of a classic. What probably really makes this movie enthralling is how it goes in a direction where most guys can relate with, yeah the situations might be different but you can feel the character to some degree, well somewhat. Overall it's a bit outdated movie but it really is worth a watch, especially if you like watching these types of movies. It's not a brilliant film but it's a good one that is very watchable.6.9/10",6,0,2,16 March 2012
Pride & Prejudice," Well directed, well acted and poetic...I like these types of films but this just wasn't really for me
","I haven't read the novel but I have read the comic adaptation of this and enjoyed it. Which was the main reason I decided to check this 2005 version out. This was a well directed movie and although I didn't read the novel it seemed like a pretty good adaptation. I didn't like all the choices for the cast in this movie, but for the most part it was superb. The music in this gives off the mood during certain scenes and for the most part I liked the melodic, calm and soothing music in this. Another positive aspect is how the dialogue gives off the poetic vibe like the comic. The cinematography sometimes has a very risky approach of going from one part of the story to another without any cuts which was cool. And because it's difficult to pull off. It's pretty obvious why this story was so remarkable for it's time, even today it stands out. Although the cinematography is vivid the movie seemed to skip around a lot, it just seemed a lot of the parts from the novel is missing so the movie just didn't seem all that well developed and connected. I was never really a big fan of Keira Knightley but she was just right for this role and not just when it came to her looks either. What really stood out to me was the subtle dynamics of this film, that I think captures the novel well. The thing is though is that although I like movies that take place during this similar time period but the movie just didn't capture my attention that well although it got slightly engrossing at times. I sometimes review movies from just my point of view and this movie just wasn't able to grab my attention although there were some music and scenes that stood out to me although few. This is a character driven movie and it captures a lot of character elements with passion. For a movie that is 2 hours it seems to be missing a lot from the novel, but it still captures the essence of the novel. There will be some people that will really love this movie but for me it just wasn't all that great to me. It's a good movie but just wasn't great.7.2/10",Null,1,2,25 September 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Movie magic!
","This is movie magic, now I don't particularly like musicals. But this is one of the great ones with some great and memorable musical numbers. The singing and dancing is spot on and it's a real treat to watch. Just about ever scene in this movie is memorable. I was lucky enough to see this on the big screen in the theater today thanks to TCM. There was a lot of old couples and their daughter in the theater and it was nice to enjoy this movie with the older audiences. It sort of felt like I traveled back in time to the 50's for 2 hours. Gene Kelly is just amazing and has the right to be called the triple threat, he can dance, he can sing and he can act. Well more so in the first two areas. Donald O'Connor brings so much energy to this movie. Debbie Reynolds is just spot on in this and she is one of the few actresses I have respect for. The story is unique and fun, it's about a actor and actresses playing actor and actress and it's a musical within a musical. The humor in this is just sweet and yet it really works. It got me laughing a few times. This is a magical experience and it's a film that all film lovers should watch.9/10",9,0,2,22 August 2012
Puss in Boots," Puss in Boots and the fluid animation and action is what carried this movie
","Now this is a movie that kids and adults can enjoy. It isn't a great family film but it's still a enjoyable one. Now if you seen the 'Shrek' franchise you will know who Puss in Boots when it comes to his character. In fact I found him to be a great supporting characters in the 'Shrek' franchise so wasn't really disappointed when I saw the trailer for a movie just for this character. Also this could be a stand alone movie and is close to being good as the first two 'Shrek' movies. The action is fast and entertaining and although the plot isn't anything special is simple and yet enjoyable to watch. The kids and adults were mostly chuckling there way through this movie. What I found sort of surprising though is how almost none of the 'Shrek' characters are in this movie and doesn't even make a cameo. Which in my opinion didn't effect this movie at all. I am glad that this went in a theatrical release direction instead of straight to DVD direction the creators originally planned. Cause this way there was more input into the movie instead of hardly putting much effort into it. The voice acting is very good in this and the character Kitty Softpaws is a very good addition to this. She reminded me of other characters I read about or seen but she is a cat and I guess that is what makes this work for the most part, although that might be unjust to some degree. The story isn't good but Puss in Boots really is the character that carries this movie. On a negative note though the story just didn't seem developed enough and thus the whole thing comes off as more of an eye candy with it's fluid CGI and action. But overall the positive outweigh the negative and to sum it up, it's a good family flick just not a great one. Sad to know that I didn't even know Puss in Boots was a real fairy tale and not just some character that popped up in the 'Shrek' series.7.3/10",Null,2,3,31 October 2011
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Bizarre and yet beautiful exploration of love, just not brilliant
","Joel Barish(Jim Carrey) is informed that his ex-girlfriend Clementine(Kate Winslet) who he was romantically involved with has had her parts of her memories erased, the memory of there relationship. The procedure was done by Dr. Mierzwiak(Tom Wilkinson) and the people that work for him. Mainly to get even he decides to get the same procedure done to himself. While the people that work for Dr. Mierzwiak go to work on Joel Barish, Joel changes his mind but the procedure is still going with his body paralyzed, but he struggles in his mind to save the memories of Clementine from being deleted. And that is basically the premise of the film, and when I first read the synopsis I thought it would be a dumb film but decided to give it a try anyways and too my surprise I thoroughly enjoyed it. It is a bizarre but intriguing film and it's wonderful in some areas as well, it also strives to be original as well. A lot of aspect of this film is absurd especially the whole procedure although it is some what fascinating but just ridiculous, but it's entirely forgivable since entire erasing of Joel's memories serves as just a backdrop to the whole film. Watching this film was like watching a bizarre dream come to life, with it dealing with love, romance and memories. The time period change can get a bit confusing though since Gondry's visual 'clues' are subtle and the character Jim Carrey played wasn't lovable and don't care as much if he able to overcome his angst, which is some of the gripe I have with the movie. It would have been nice if they pushed the character creativity a bit further. I also found it to be a bit self indulgent which is okay, but also seem to drag the film at times. The film isn't complex or deep as some people claim it to be, it's a straight forward story but a good one.7.9/10",7,0,2,29 October 2009
Elysium," Hollywood's 'Battle Angel Alita'?
","I was expecting quite a bit from the director of 'District 9' and thus wanted a lot out of this movie. And it doesn't deliver all the goods, but it's still a competent sci-fi movie. It's also riddled with political messages which is fine, but the movie as a whole just doesn't make sense. Even for a futuristic setting on earth, it simply has a lot of plot-holes. And doesn't have the edge to make the audiences more absorbed with the characters and the situations they are facing. In another words it just isn't a very compelling movie. It also seemed to be missing bits and pieces that could have made this movie great as a whole. Not sure if it's because of the budget, but it just seemed like it needed something more going for it. The characters motives and agenda just doesn't make much sense a lot of times. And thus seems like bits and pieces of the scenes were missing. 'Elysium' however does have some great scenes that stand out though and even cool adult sci-fi elements. Sharlto Copley however is the scene stealer in this despite Matt Damon being the main protagonist or anti-hero. Sharlto Copley is an actor that has range. He goes from a weak mild mannered manager and reporter in 'District 9' to the crazy guy in 'The A-Team'. To this intimidating, sadistic, and psychotic agent or mercenary that works for Elysium. Like I said the plot isn't anything mesmerizing or amazing but it does get the job done for the most part. It's about 150yrs into the future, where there is basically two classes of people. People that live on earth and people that live on Elysium. Earth is over populated and polluted to the point of instinction and police(run by Elysium) brutality is at it's worst. But life in Elysium provides just about everything a human being can want in life. It even has cure for cancer, facial change and reconstruction, healing, even increase lifespan. So the people of earth all want to reach Elysium where all the rich and wealthy people live. But people on Elysium doesn't want immigrant coming in, so they can keep all their lavish lifestyles to themselves. Especially Jessica Delacourt(Jodie Foster) who is the secretary of defense in Elysium. And when the protagonist played by Matt Damon ends up only having 5 days to live. He takes the initiative and tries everything to fight and reach Elysium. The plot and setting of this sci-fi movie reminded me of 'Battle Angel Alita' a lot. And wouldn't be surprised if Neill Blomkamp either got a lot of ideas or was inspired by 'Battle Angel Alita'. Although 'Elysium' just doesn't fully deliver and didn't really develop upon it's cool and innovative ideas. It didn't beat or even meet my expectations but it was a alright watch. 'District 9' is the better film overall.6.8/10",6,0,2,17 August 2013
Taken," Becareful who you mess with
","Now this movie is basically the epitome of a badass Liam Neeson. Sure Liam has played some badass characters before and will do so in the future but he is a badass in this one as well. Luc Besson is one of the writer for this movie and he is known for being part of making quasi video game style action movies. Sometimes he succeeds and sometimes he doesn't, this is one of the movie he does succeed. Now the plot isn't anything amazing, in fact it's pretty straightforward. But the action and everything is so cool without it being cheesy. Now you don't really find out the exact background of Liam's character Bryan Mills but the movie does give hints. His character is a someone that has ethics and knows exactly what to do in order to get the job done when it comes to his special set of skills. But he isn't a nice guy either and will do whatever it takes to retrieve what he lost. And that is what stands out about this character. He isn't a moralistic character that has to be the nice guy or the very good guy to with the audiences approval. The plot is this Bryan Mills(Liam Neeson) is divorced but has a daughter but she is with his wife and her new husband. The new husband is a rich guy that provides anything for his wife and daughter but Bryan still has a lot of love for her daughter. And wants to make up for lost time with her and win his daughter's affection. The wife who is played by Famke Janssen who was in the X-Men movies and GoldenEye is simply a mean gold digger. Anyways his daughter gets kidnapped and all hell breaks lose because they angered the wrong man. Overall if you want to see a simple but fun and cool action movie this one might be for you. I heard there will be a sequel to this movie and I am hoping it isn't a terrible one. And not just a cash in for the sake of a sequel but have a coherent and fun story with better action scenes.7.8/10",7,0,1,21 June 2012
Alice in Wonderland," Shame Tim Burton's great imagination can't match his storytelling
","This is basically a sequel to the original 'Alice in Wonderland' and not a good one at that. Tim Burton has a good vivid imagination when it comes to his films, such as this one. It's a shame though that his level of creative doesn't match his level of storytelling because the plot just wasn't that good. Johnny Depp is a actor that really gets into his roles, but there just wasn't anything memorable about this one, he just looked like a clown with the mix of personalities between Willy Wonka and Jack Sparrow. For a place called Wonderland, people would expect a lot of mad characters to be in it, but everyone seemed pretty normal. As a matter of fact everything seemed find and dandy until Alice decides to comeback to Wonderland, than all hell breaks lose for some reason. It's a shame Tim Burton's great imagination can't match his level of of storytelling.6.8/10",7,1,1,26 March 2010
Toy Story 2," This is not a superior sequel
","Some say that 'Toy Story 2' is better than 'Toy Story' and I have to disagree. This sequel doesn't really add a lot of new elements. The creators did think up cool and interesting ways to use the toys or the abilities of the toys was fun at some parts, but that didn't really do it for me. The scene where the toys are running around the toy store trying to find Woody was amusing and all, but to sum it all up it's basically a rescue mission with toys. Except instead of Woody trying to rescue Buzz, the roles are reversed. It just basically adds new toys and some cameos, but besides the creative ways each of the toys act and do with what they are given, I just don't see how this movie can be superior to the first 'Toy Story' movie. Even the scene with Zurg was not that necessary, it didn't really add or take away from the film.***Might be spoiler*** Buzz who is the character that Tim Allen played, but entertaining cause of the personality and stood out from the other toys. But in this one he isn't as interesting and I know they had to go in this direction, but with it's character but it was still dull compared to his character in the first movie and thus the creators just tossed a second Buzz in the film.All in all, it was a fun movie but definitely not superior to the first 'Toy Story'8/10",8,0,2,7 October 2009
Frank," Absurd, weird and intriguing
","For the audiences wanting this to be a bio-pic of Frank Sidebottom where his mannerism and characteristics is nailed down to a T will be left disappointed. However if you want to watch a movie that revolve around weird and strange characters and yet intriguing. Or a movie that is influenced by Frank Sidebottom, you just might enjoy this film. This movie sort of reminded me of a more indy version of 'Almost Famous' except with weirder characters and scenarios. And unlike 'Almost Famous' the narrator isn't the innocent boy who is looking into what being in a real band is like. But the innocent character is actually Frank the lead singer who is this socially awkward guy that is uncomfortable around many people. To my surprise this movie does have few genuinely funny moments as well and doesn't fall too much into the dark and depressing areas when it comes to the human mind. On the exterior it might seem like a movie about a bunch of hipsters. But it also delves into the pretentiousness of what people may call art and how easily some people can fall into a farse by looking for a deeper meaning. And it also adds modern touches when it comes to the influences of the internet, such as sites like Youtube. The music on the other hand is pretty bad to put is plainly, but the movie is not about the music. But the drive of the characters and what makes them tick. As a matter of fact watching this movie was like watching a group that is part of a psych ward. It's about the narrators self realization by delving into reality and seeing things for what it really is. So although the title says Frank, but the movie is not really about Frank. Frank is more of a concept that the narrator is trying to chase after. Overall this is a in-depth movie that is worth checking out.8/10",8,0,1,7 December 2015
Drag Me to Hell," Perfect blend of horror and comedy
","What this movie is, is a perfect blend of horror and comedy. The horror parts really will give you chills and make you be on the edge of your seat. Some scenes can even get creepy to the point you just want it to be over with but enjoy the intensity at the same time. Sam Raimi who is the director did a great job with the 'Evil Dead' series and he does it again with 'Drag Me to Hell'. I make a reference to 'Evil Dead' because it has similar elements but different setting and plot. The story is about a girl that gets cursed by a very old gypsy woman and thus the girl gets tormented by the curse and lot of terrible and vulgar things starts to happen to her. And while this is going on she does whatever she can to beat the curse and she is a character you can't help but feel sympathetic for. And beat the old hag in this movie that cursed her. I first saw this movie when it came out in 2009 in theater and even seeing it today it still gave me chills throughout the whole movie. Even the comedic parts although funny made me chuckle in a uneasy manner. The instrument violin can be a pretty creepy instrument and it's used effectively to add to the chill factor. The really scary horror movie uses this tactic as well and the music really does add to the intensity. Although some parts of this movie doesn't make much sense sometimes, overall most of it is executed very well. Movies like this show you don't always need blood and gore to make a effective scary movie.8.3/10",8,1,2,4 June 2012
Grindhouse," Don't see movies like this anymore, it's a pretty darn good experience and for the most part fun
","I gotta admit the reason I went to theaters in order to watch this back to back feature film was cause one of the film 'Death Proof' is directed by Quentin Tarantino. And to my surprise I enjoyed watching 'Planet Terror' directed by Robert Rodriguez more. It just had that exploitation film feel to it and was more entertaining to watch all the outrageous and zombie mayhem that happens on screen. 'Death Proof' on the other hand is a self indulgent film, which I usually don't complain about but when I first watch it, it was pretty dull. With it's endless dialogue that wasn't that intriguing or interesting, and Tarantino is known for writing some amazing and immersive dialogues. The second time I watched 'Death Proof' though I got to appreciating the film a bit more. So yeah 'Planet Terror' started out with a bang and was just great to watch some of the crazy stuff on screen although some stuff just didn't make any sense and was really random. But that was how horror/exploitation films were like, even if this film had a budget of $53 million, when those grindhouse theater films was a lot cheaper. I also liked how it purposely has the damaged and aged effects in the film, the unconventional techniques made it feel like your watching one of those exploitation/horror films from the 70's well at least sort of. In theaters I wished the movie had intermissions, yeah it has fake trailers where you could go take a break and not miss the movie parts, but I really wanted to watch all the fake trailers as well. As a double feature film, it really is worth the price of admission. But if you separate the film and if it wasn't a back to back double feature film, than it's worth just renting it. I don't know how many of the fake trailers is going to be a full feature films. Since 'Machete' is now a full feature film and all, but looking forward to other ones as well. I am also glad Quentin decided to become a director instead of an actor, cause he is just a terrible actor although his cameo was somewhat interesting. The other actors and actresses that shows up for the fake trailers and both the movies or at least a cameo was a pretty cool idea though.7.9/10",7,0,1,7 October 2010
Mission: Impossible," The start of a cool spy thriller that isn't too convoluted
","This is a cool and stylish spy thriller but also intelligent at the same time. This movie will inspire many films to come and there will be a lot of parodies for this movie. Yeah, the movie does have few bleak moments but it isn't way too far in between. This is going to be one of the biggest franchise for Tom Cruise and will lead to sequel. Some of the technology may not be plausible now and especially during 1996 but it isn't so far-fetched you can't really buy into it. Some scenarios may come off a gimmicky to some with the action sequences but it's still well crafted and blends right into the movie. The spy thrill elements are integrated very well and the theme song is just great. In fact the theme song is one of the most memorable them song in movie history. Although it was first used for the TV show before this movie. Few of the gadget seem a bit outdated, I mean it's still cool but nothing really amazing like how it was in 1996. The cool aspect of this movie might be a bit outdated but it was really cool for it's time and it's a stylish adaptation. Overall it's a spy thriller that should not be missed for anyone that is into this type of genre, especially if you like mystery thrillers. It isn't anything groundbreaking when it comes to the plot but it's still pretty good and there are some obvious plot holes but it's a movie that will inspire future movies of this genre and for the most part it is a entertaining spy thriller for adults. That flick isn't all about special effects, shoot outs and things blowing up. But a good mix between spy elements and a bit of action in it although the spy elements can be a bit over the top with the situation and all. But even the action for the most part is essential to the plot for the most part. It's a shame the next sequel isn't very good but still will be looking forward to this franchise to constantly get better as it progresses.7.8/10",Null,0,1,8 November 2011
La La Land," Marvelous
","This is a musical that I thoroughly enjoyed from start to finished. It's a very vibrant and colorful film that mixes the thematic elements from the old fashioned musicals and themes in the present. And the collision of all the enrollments works together really well. Usually I get bored of musicals, because the songs aren't all that catchy and gets boring to listen to despite the characters emotions sometimes. However in this, just about all the songs are catchy and exciting and some of it even heartfelt. When the song 'Another Day of Sun' started off as the intro, I just had this had this giddy smirk. Mainly because the song is so darn catchy and old fashioned while having that present suave take to it. The main core aspect of the story is about 2 passionate people trying to achieve their dreams. While the romance parts is basically the secondary aspect of the story. The two actors was great choices for the lead. Ryan Gosling is just really good at bringing about this suave and charismatic jazz pianist. He was the replacement for Miles Teller, as good of an actor Teller is I think Gosling was the right choice. I also heard that Emma Watson was first conspired for this role which might have worked as well. But Emma Stone seem to hit the right notes when it came to the singing scenes. Overall, this is a colorful and marvelous musical that I thoroughly enjoyed. However some overly cynical, jaded or nihilistic audiences might not enjoy this movie as much. But for those that still have hope, dreams, passion and believe in love and romance will fall for it. It's the perfect date movie that couples can sit through.9/10",9,3,8,21 January 2017
Saw," The start of a long running franchise
","I was first intrigued by the trailer of this film is why I chose to watch it despite the positive reception it was getting when it first came out. The scenario of a serial killer who plays a game of life and death without getting his hands dirty was amusing and actually quite original. The serial killer got the reputation of being called Jigsaw cause he makes the victims go through a game where blood shed is needed to survive, he is obsessed with teaching his victims the value of life, in a deranged and sadistic way after abducting them. So basically he tries to test the fabric of human nature. The main victims of this game is Adam Faulkner-Stanheight(Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon(Cary Elwes), they have to face different choices in order to survive and depending on the choice, it will decide if one or both of them will survive. This was a good and entertaining horror thriller, that is well worth the audiences time, mainly cause of the creativity and a cool twist that happens near the end. The acting in this movie is not very good, especially Cary Elwes. I think he is better off doing comedies like 'Robin Hood: Men in Tights' cause his acting is actually quite funny during serious scenes. And while the victims are trying to solve Jigsaw's puzzle, it goes back and forth with a cop played by Danny Glover who is obsessed with tracking Jigsaw down. Despite the films low budget, it will keep the audience intrigued and will keep them guessing, it is a suspenseful film that has thrills and chills. Worth checking out if you want to see some originality in horror, just not that good the second time around cause most saw movies are known for flash backs with a twist, but this is a good start.7.5/10",7,0,1,27 October 2009
Mama," Besides the structure, design and vibe everything else is mediocre
","I liked the structure, design and vibe of this movie but everything else was kinda mediocre. It's basically a ghost haunting movie, of course the ghosts in different movies haunts for different reasons. But this one is a ghost haunting movie. Where two sibling kids that move like a spider Gollum especially the younger one that gets found in a small house in the woods. And a couple decides to take care of them because the guy feels responsible because they are the daughters of his brother who disappeared. And the 30yr old garage band girl who is the girlfriend of the guy because she feels that she needs to put up with it. This movie does a decent job of making a dis-likable character somewhat likable near the end. Like I said the structure, design and vibe adds a lot to the creepiness but when it comes to the story, it doesn't really stand out. This movie is much better than 'Don't Be Afraid Of The Dark' which is another movie presented by Guillermo del Toro. But it doesn't reach the psychedelic dreamlike vibe that is creepy or even scary and yet beautiful although it tries to be. The film 'The Orphanage' comes to mind. 6/10",6,22,43,31 January 2013
Super 8," Sort of nostalgic but expected more from J.J. Abrams
","When I first saw the trailer to this flick, I couldn't really tell what this movie was about but I liked the vibe to it. I wasn't super hyped to see this movie when I saw the trailer but it was sort of fascinating because of the mystery behind it. Unfortunately this movie is one of those flicks where the trailer is much better than the actual movie itself. I could tell what it was trying to do, but the execution just wasn't really engaging and the build up wasn't even interesting or intriguing for the most part. In fact the build up was so very slow paced and boring to the point I don't see how any kid can stick with this movie. Maybe the target audiences are older people that will get a sense of nostalgia from watching this, since it has a bit of 80's vibe to it with normal kids put to a extraordinary task. Which would have been nice if this movie itself was entertaining, but it wasn't. The main thing I liked about this movie however is the cinematography it felt nostalgic and modern at the same time.5/10",5,0,2,24 June 2011
The Last Samurai," Excellent fantasy film!
","This isn't a very accurate historical movie and not because it has a white guy playing the Last Samurai. But it's a riveting movie, that has depth and a style that sticks. I remember watching this in theaters and being blown away by how immersive and entertaining this film was at that time. I still watch it from time to time and just doesn't seem to get old. I love films, but a film has to be exceptionally good for me to revisit and check out all over again. And like I said, I watched this movie multiple times. It's like a fantasy movie with historical elements coming to life. And when I mean fantasy, I mean the way they portrayed the samurais in this. They really tried to over glorify and glamorize the samurai and their way of life. It made it appear more like a samurai anime over real samurais in japan at the time. Like they only cared about honor over hierarchy and power. The armor, appearance and the way they dressed was off as well. Yoji Yamada's Samurai Trilogy is a more realistic portrayal of samurais. But that is just what it is, it's a samurai fantasy movie and it's very entertaining to sit through. The film is over about 2 hours and 30 minutes long but feels like a 1 and a half film. While the story being inspired by a real historical figure Jules Brunet, it doesn't even touches the surface when it comes to that area. Watching this is sort of like watching a epic '300' movie. Except with more immersive and heartfelt story that strays away from it just being about the action and violence with more character development. Tom Cruise is outstanding in this and was at the time the perfect guy to play the lead role as the emotionally damaged character named Nathan Algren. Who is a captain in this story that fought against the Indians and has guilt trips about it all. This was the breakout role for Ken Watanabe who plays the supporting character in this. As katsumoto who is the leader of the samurais, he brings about charisma and standout presence when he is on screen. Some say this is like 'Dances with Wolves' except with samurais. However I liked this film more. This is a emotional film about code and honor, that pierces through the screen and has an affect like Hayao Miyazaki films. 10/10",10,1,3,19 February 2016
Sinister," Too long, repetitive and not that scary
","The trailer for this movie was more scary than the movie itself, hich was disappointing. Maybe I saw way too many horror movies to the point I am unfazed by them...Which would be sad. But this movie just wasn't all that scary, in fact the scare factor is pretty low. It does have creepy and eerie vibe going for it with some clever dialogue at times. But this movie just seemed way to repetitive and too long. Yes, there was some gasps from the audience but some of them was whispering when this movie was going to end. So the plot is about a one hit wonder author that tries to get back into the limelight by dragging him and his family to a house where some brutal murders happened. And soon he finds some super 8 films that has titles on them. And each one has gristly murders, but there really isn't a coherent way it connects to the whole story. It's like watching a couple of snuff films but it doesn't seem to connect with the main story all that well. Thus it becomes less interesting and less clever. It has a decent idea going for it but it was just poorly executed without any real scares. The ending is also disappointing as well and doesn't bring anything new to the table for horror fans. Not a bad film but could have been better.5.5/10",5,23,46,17 October 2012
Snowden," I recommend 'Citizenfour'
","I am just going to say it but 'Citizenfour' is a more intriguing and thought provoking film compared to this. Despite this being a story driven movie and the other being a documentary. As it got me to understand why the film 'Lincoln' didn't focus on showing the whole life story of Abraham Lincoln from him being born in a log cabin to everything else. There is a lot of positive aspects about this movie, such as the cinematography and the superb acting by Joseph Gordon-Levitt. Joseph Gordon-Levitt really put on his A game by trying to look and act like Edward Snowden. I also though the dramatic portion of the film didn't go super overboard to the point it got really cheesy. But here is the thing, the movie goes in a step by step direction. Which didn't really bring about any emotions or inspirations for me as the viewers. The whole Edward Snowden private life and his ticks just didn't interest me at all. I know this might make me come off as a snobbish viewer but the whole thing just came off uninspiring and bland. Despite it trying to portray Snowden as this super smart patriotic guy that has a love affair with a girl and tries to do the right thing. It just didn't have that build up that lead to that impact that it needed. Overall 'Snowden' is a alright film but not something that will bring out any emotions or entertain the audiences much.7/10",7,0,7,11 December 2016
Rio," Maybe the kids might like it, but overall a very generic and formulaic CGI animated movie that relies too much on wacky characters
","This is a pretty bad family flick, however the kids might enjoy it although I seen a lot of them get bored in theater and started to wander off. The characters are over wacky all the time in order to get the audience attention, but I lost interest very quickly. It's like watching something dull, trying to be exciting and entertaining. Even if a whole bunch of characters are constantly wacky and bouncing around all over the place. Now I enjoy watching CGI animated movies, but this one just wasn't engaging at all. In fact I found myself checking my phone a couple of times. The jokes were also very forced and didn't get any laugh or chuckle from anyone, including the kid audiences. Everything about this CGI animated flick seemed overdone in a negative way and so very generic to the point it becomes so very predictable. None of the characters in this was even all that likable or made me actually care for any of them. Plus the direction of it all is so very formulaic.4/10",4,6,16,2 May 2011
Reservoir Dogs," Stylish, slick and cool cult classic
","When I first saw this movie during when I was still a teen. I was blown away by it, from the dialogues, the build up and the twist. I was intrigued from beginning to end. Despite the whole story revolving around a heist, it doesn't actually show the heist. It doesn't even really show the planning of the heist. But despite it lacking when it comes to scheming and planning things out while showing the whole process like 'Ocean's Eleven'. I was still intrigued and entertained throughout the whole running time. I just recently saw this film again, although I am still confused about the title of why it's called 'Reservoir Dogs. It's a magnetic film that drew me in and kept me focused. I still think this film is a bit overrated, I mean it's not one of the best films I have ever seen or anything like that. But I still think it's one heck of an accomplishment. I mean it's a crime film that revolves around a heist while not even showing the heist and yet it can entertain and entice the audiences is a accomplishment. It shows what happened before and after the heist but not the actual heist itself. What makes this movie stand out is not just the cool dialogues, but it's the stylishly cool and suave style of it all. Plus it does have some iconic scenes some people try to do a parody of, especially the introduction scene where the character walk to their cars. This is a cool, slick and compelling movie that did a lot with the resources they had. Even the acting is top notch, a bit over the top at times but for a film like this it works.9/10",9,0,1,21 July 2016
How to Train Your Dragon," Watching the flight sequences was awesome
","This is a superb 3D movie, and I was blown away by the flight sequences. Even if the plot is clichÃ© to a lot of these 3D movies about a screw up becoming a hero later on. Just watching the flight sequences was enough for the price of admission, even if none of the characters are even remotely memorable. Watch this movie in theaters or IMAX in 3D or it isn't going to be as good, kids and adults will have a good time watching this, even if the plot is straight forward the pacing however is well done. This film is one of the prime examples of effective 3D and a very well done one at that as well.7.9/10",7,1,3,11 April 2010
Total Recall," You will still probably have a decent time with this one
","Although it's a bit outdated and cheesy as hell, it's still a re- watchable movie even in 2015. Like I said the setting, the character interactions and the costume design is very cheesy but when it comes to the direction and development to the main twist it is done pretty well. It's not a sci-fi movie that I would watch over and over again and think of it as a classic. But I do have a bit of respect for what it accomplished when it came out. It's not the most clever or intelligent sci-fi film like the book this movie is based on. Not even quite sure if Arnold Schwarzenegger was the right actor to play this role. But it's Arnold so he does make this film to not be overly serious, dark but leads to memorable lines and humors. Not that those lines are highly intelligent and makes you think, but it's humorous. Some of the interactions are far from being something that you can accept as being legit even for a movie that came out in the early 90's. It's still a movie you can watch around friends with a couple of beers. Overall I think this is a good movie for it's time that audiences can still have a decent time with. I give this movie a 7.5/10 because I do think it inspired other film makers like the Wachowskis.7.5/10",7,0,2,17 January 2016
Limitless," Starts out a bit engaging but loses it and becomes dull
","Maybe it's because I was expecting more from this movie cause I personally didn't find this movie to be all that great. The premise may seem cool and actually that is basically all it's going for this movie. It's about a pill that allows people to use 100% of there brain which can make anyone that uses it to become a super genius. But like always there are conflicts that go with it. So yeah the premise is kinda cool, but the thing is, although the movie starts out engaging it starts to get dull later on. The movie is simply generic for the most part and really predictable. The direction is also very unimaginative and nothing all that cool happens. Although the movie revolves around a genius for the most part. Maybe it tries to go in a realistic approach but it was still pretty darn dull. I liked the fast pacing of this movie but there are sacrifices since the movie goes from one point to another point without hardly explaining and the characters are not very developed as well. I also agree with some of the reviewers when it comes to the moral of this movie, especially when it comes to the ending. This movie is at best a rental and nothing more.5/10",5,6,11,24 June 2011
Rocky," The start of one of the most well known boxing icon
",This is the underdog story that really hits the core of the heart. That really pulls you in because of the character Rocky. Who is a very likable and yet flawed amateur boxer. The struggles to make ends meet and falling in love aspect of this film was raw. Even the slow scenes had my attention and I really felt for the character Rocky Balboa despite him being fictional and all. Sylvester Stallone did a fantastic job writing to script and I could tell why he wanted badly to take the lead role in this. Even by making big sacrifices and taking cuts in his paycheck to make it work. It really is a touching boxing film. The build up has a lot of meat to it and when it hits it brings the momentum. This is a movie about a underdog that goes the distance to prove to himself. It has heart and has elements that uplift and inspire the viewers. This is a true classic that will be a part of Sylvester Stallone's legacy.9/10,9,1,1,8 January 2016
Don't Breathe," Think zombie game
","First of all I really liked the set up for this movie and how it shows each characters background. And where they come from and what is motivating them to do this theft. It deals with three characters trying to rob a blind veteran at his secluded home. But what ensues is more than the three was prepared for. So yeah, I thought the set up was well done and I thoroughly enjoyed the camera work and how it transitions to the next scene. That also includes the editing as well, which is don't superbly for a film such as this. However when the chase and hid and seek ensues it quickly got boring for me. Mainly because there really wasn't any tension and because there just wasn't anyone to root for. The girl in the group had some fight in her, but the other two males was just so darn wimpy. I know it's because they needed to be wimpy because they are dealing with a blind man who is really built for his age. So the action can be dragged out longer. But it was just got so darn aggravating to watch during certain parts. It's pretty clear the director was inspired by David Fincher and his movie the 'Panic Room'. Except it's the burglars that are getting hunted this time around. The premise is like the zombie game. You know the game where the it person closes his or her eye or wears a blindfold and tries to tag others. While they run around trying not to make noises, well that is what this movie is. There really wasn't anything that really stood out to me about this movie. But I give it credit for it's effort, the camera work, the set up and the last act.6.5/10",6,0,4,18 December 2016
Eyes Wide Shut," Stanley Kubrick's final film
",This is a compelling movie that has a bit of suspense and sexual aspects to it. Like some Stanley Kubrick's other films this is one of those movies that is kinda uncomfortable to watch. The portrayal of sexual thoughts between William Harford(Tom Cruise) and his wife Alice(Nicole Kidman) is interesting. This is a very provocative film that has to do with psychotic and sexual thoughts and behaviors. It isn't one of Kubrick's best work though but still a engaging movie from beginning to end although it can be messed up sometimes. Actually a lot of times. Although it lacks the impact in most Kubrick's films his pacing and way of revealing certain elements as the movie progresses is well crafted. And also knows how much to show and how much to leave in the audiences imagination.6.9/10,6,1,3,16 January 2013
Sicario," One of my favorite films of 2015
","I didn't know much about this movie, just that it will involve a group of agents going after the Mexican drug cartel. So I at least knew it was going to be violent, messy, gritty and gruesome. Because, well it's revolves around the Mexican drug cartel and they have no limits when it comes to what they are capable of. Like they have zero conscious when it comes to guilt. And the fact that it's directed by a talented director who knows how to bring out certain amount of realism, especially when it comes to the cinematography made me feel nervous and felt like I had some adrenaline pumping into my veins. Now the story isn't something that really stands out or anything like that but good enough and the directing is really well done, especially with the spot on cinematography, it really brings the film to life. As for the cast, let's just say that there was no miscast. Emily Blunt plays this agent that is feminine and yet capable of doing her job. I am glad that they didn't make her character into this tough cookie that is a complete badass and proficient at what she does. But is a character that has certain levels of vulnerability, which added to the tension during serious scenes. She looked confused half the time and yet knew what she was doing at the same time while being persistent. Again great acting from Emily Blunt, she seems to really nail this military type or roles. Anyways her character is sort of like the view point of the audiences, where what she is thinking is what the audiences are thinking when watching this for the first time. The last film I saw Benicio del Toro in was in 'Savages' where he plays this ruthless villain who is part of the drug cartel. So I found it interesting how he plays this badass with experience that knows what he is doing and is also a mystery man. And Josh Brolin as this laid back CIA agent and adviser, that doesn't dress professionally and you don't know what his exact motives are. Overall this film does have believable and well developed characters and the plot although not anything spectacular isn't all that predictable. And it feeds the audiences bit by bit on what is going on in a impactful fashion. Watching this movie was sort of like watching a live action 'Ghost in the Shell' movie. Except instead of echnobabbles it leans more towards jurisdictions and boundaries. While bringing out the instinctual and emotional human behaviors. This is a highly impactful thriller that I would highly recommend.9.3/10",9,0,4,20 December 2015
Pretty Woman," Adult fairy-tale that somewhat work
","Okay, so this movie is suppose to be a romantic classic and one of Julia Roberts trademark movie. So I decided to see it, this is a sappy movie and is pretty predictable most of the way through but for some reason it's kinda engaging. Maybe it's because of some good lines in the movie, as corny as it maybe sometimes though. So the premise is this, a rich guy picks up a hooker for some reason and likes her enough to the point he is willing to pay her 3 grand to stay with him for a week as an escort to events he needs or wants to attend. And one thing leads to another and so on. Now the chemistry doesn't really develop to the point you can understand why they like each other besides the superficial, materialistic or sex getting in the way. So in another words most of the comes off superficial and pretentious. The premise of a rich guy and a poor girl has been done so many times, but in this it just didn't seem all that developed. Even the parts about building a conscious isn't very believable either. But that being said it did a alright job of putting everything together in less than 2 hours. While in most Asian dramas that have a similar premise takes up 16 to 20 episodes and usually tends to drag. This movie will inspire other dramas to come that share the same or similar elements. In a way this is sort of like the 90's 'The Notebook'. Anyways overall this is a shallow and predictable flick with some sentimental stuff in it and to some degree it's entertaining.6/10",6,0,1,23 March 2012
The Descent," Great build up and tension
","When I first saw this movie when it first came out on DVD, I thought it was a really solid horror movie. Watching it now, I personally think that it still holds up today. The plot has enough to draw you into the lead characters and how they go about trying to escape from a cave they descended into. The descent into the cave really does bring about madness between the characters. And it shows the true colors of the characters as things start to escalate. I thought the set design were for the most part quite believable with it's claustrophobic setting. The scenes where the characters had to queeze through tight crevices brought about tension. And the design of the creatures that tries to attack and eat the people that descended into the cave to be believable. So when the creatures pop out and attack, I was on the edge of my seat. What really stands out about this film is the transition of the characters. How they all start to become survivalist and the sight that grossed them out in the beginning doesn't faze them as much. And some of them transition into total badasses in a realistic manner. This is a well crafted and designed horror movie with great pacing and build up.8.3/10",8,1,3,10 January 2017
Pulp Fiction," Definitely one of the best film's of the 90's
","This is Quentin Tarantino at his best, he is known for writing some amazing dialogue and I must say the dialogue in this is just brilliant and none of it is wasted, it's witty, entertaining and observant. I personally think this is the film that made Samuel L. Jackson as this crazy badass. This is simply Quentin Tarantino's masterpiece that needs to be watched if your a movie lover. Definitely one of the best films of the 90's, and deserves to be in anyone's movie collection cause it just ain't one without this. This really is a true original, some complain that this film is a bit overrated but let me tell you this deserves to be overrated. Yeah sure there is no deep message behind this movie, but who cares.9.4/10",9,2,5,13 April 2010
Jack Reacher," Entertaining and exhilarating investigation/action film
","Tyler Perry as Alex Cross was lame but Tom Cruise as Jack Reacher is excellent. Sure Tom doesn't have that physical stature of Jack Reacher from Lee Child's novels and nowhere near as tall. But Tom Cruise really brings out that tough, charismatic, intelligent, suave and cool attributes so well for his character Jack Reacher I just didn't care. Tom really does steal the show in this one despite him being the main character. And his performance and the character Jack Reacher was more entertaining to watch compared to a character like Alex Cross...Well at least for me. And unlike the movie 'Alex Cross' which should have made it straight to DVD or Blu-ray. This one has enough to be a theater film. This is actually a intelligent film, not the most intelligent investigation film I seen but has enough. And it's just entertaining to watch Jack Reacher handle certain situations mainly because he is somewhat of a anti-hero and it's cool to see him analyze kick ass and take names. Overall this is a entertaining and exhilarating investigation/action movie and worth seeing. Heck I might just watch it again and I rarely do that for investigation films.7.6/10",7,2,6,24 April 2013
"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"," Guy Ritchie Begins
","This movie is what launched Guy Ritchie's career and for good reason even if it's his debut movie as well. I can tell Ritchie is a fan of Quentin Tarantino or at least inspired by his work cause this movie has certain elements that seem like it was inspired by Tarantino. Which isn't necessarily a bad thing in some cases including this one. What drives this movie is the over the top and snazzy dialogue despite the constant profanity. The plot is simple but goes in a slightly convoluted direction. In fact for some viewers it maybe difficult to understand what is exactly going on when viewing for the first time. Mainly because it has multiple different group of people, each group having their own story but later comes together in one melting pot. The plot includes hustlers, thieves, loan sharks and gangsters but they are all after one thing and that is money. In fact most of the movie revolves around the characters bickering, arguing and fighting each other for money while using some flashy and witty British dialogue. The dialogue sometimes even has some pretty good humor in it, the black comedy aspect of this movie really works and doesn't seem forced at all. Lot of the good humor comes from the awkwardness of certain situations though. The plot isn't all that coherent and seem over the place at times, but the good dialogue is able to back that up. This movie shows that being a fanboy and getting inspiration from other people's work can create something very watchable as long as they don't plagiarize. Since there is a difference between inspiration and just plain copying in a very secretive manner. If you wanna watch a movie about bunch of guys quarreling over money in a entertaining manner in a sort of Tarantino style fashion, this movie might be for you. This is one of those movies where the build up is most definitely worth it when it comes to the finale. This isn't a artistic movie or has any morals but if you want a movie with a good blend of violence and profanity this one just might be for you.7.8/10",7,0,3,4 June 2012
Les MisÃ©rables," A excellent masterpiece!
","This is one of the most amazing film I have ever seen. It's over 2 hours and 30 minutes long but every moment of it is captivating and mesmerizing. It's like a modern generation 'The Sound of Music'. There is just so much heart and emotion in every scene. This is a musical where just about every dialogue is a musical and although it isn't the best singing of each song, it's the most emotional ones I seen so far. There are few places I wanted a bit more development but besides that this film is flawless. Plus it's probably to fit every aspect of the story in a certain amount of running time. Hugh Jackman and Anne Hathaway got roles from this movie probably because of their performance hosting the Oscars. And they are just fantastic in this movie, and puts every ounce of effort and emotions into their scenes. Russell Crowe is also great in this despite the critics criticism when it comes to his singing. To be honest I thought his singing was fine and didn't get irritating to listen to. The supporting actors and actresses is also good. I know it sounds lame but watching this movie I felt my heart sing. If I don't give this movie a 10 I don't know what other film I would give it to besides few others. This is a movie that rarely comes out from Hollywood and it's a film that is a must watch. I was thoroughly hyped for this film when I saw the trailer and it beat my expectations.10/10",10,1,1,16 April 2013
The Da Vinci Code," Excellent adventure that blends fact and fiction in a clever manner
","This is a pretty clever adventure/mystery/thriller movie that combines fact and fiction. And I must say it was really entertaining all the way through. In fact this is one of the best adaptation from a novel to a movie. Ron Howard is just excellent when it comes to this and the cinematography and the pacing makes things more immerse and exciting. When the book came out by Dan Brown it was taboo and just about anything that is taboo gets attention. But if you look as some aspect of this film as just fictional entertainment you just might enjoy this movie. Even if some parts just seems way too far-fetched or implausible and I am not talking about the spiritual or supernatural elements that are in the movie. It's still a well crafted and clever film. Watching this movie was like watching a way more entertaining, exciting and intelligent version of 'National Treasure'. There is quite a bit of twist and turns as well but it mostly all fits together well. Overall if you like modern day adventure this one shouldn't be passed on.8.3/10",8,1,3,12 February 2013
Titanic," Has all the right elements to be a great romance movie for the mainstream audience
","I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.7.9/10",7,2,4,6 June 2012
Rocky III," Eye Of The Tiger
","It doesn't have the depth and heart that the first one did. But it's still a alright sequel in the franchise, not great but it's a alright watch. So Rocky is back, the boxer with the heart of gold is back again. He may not be the brightest boxer, but he has heart and he has the eye of the tiger. So it's basically a movie with a boxer with a heart of gold, but lacks much emotional depth and heart compared to the first one. But than again it's really difficult to top the first 'Rocky' film. The film is about Rocky's passion in the boxing game, his relationship with Rocky's coach Mickey (who is sort of a plot device in this). And his relationship with Apollo Creed, who becomes his new coach. That teaches Rocky to become a more confident, hungry, flexible and rhythmic fighter. To go against one of the most iconic Rocky opponent in the franchise Clubber Lang. Clubber Lang is such a stereotypical opposing boxer who seems to be a utter jerk just for the sake of being a jerk. It also has a returning character that probably no one wanted, Paulie. If Rocky Balboa is a man of heart and integrity, Paulie is the opposite. Overall this is a good fast-paced installment in the 'Rocky' franchise that is worth a watch. It does seem sort of commercial at times, with Hulk Hogan making a cameo appearance.7.3/10",7,0,0,6 February 2016
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Not a terrible adaptation to this popular series, but pretty mediocre
","From what I can remember this movie has a lot of the parts in the book in the actual movie. The thing is the way the movie is executed seemed lame and poorly executed. Some scenes were done pretty well but overall it was a boring experience to sit through this whole movie. It isn't a terrible book to movie adaptation, but it just wasn't that good. A lot of movies isn't as good as the novels it is based on or adapted into and this movie is mediocre at best. And if I review this movie without reading the book, I would probably give it a lower score. Since it's this franchise that kept me interested although I am not a fan of Harry Potter novels. On a positive note I liked how almost every character looked the way I imagined them to look. The acting in this movie however is atrocious, it was like watching a live version of of a Saturday morning cartoon show. Except few of them that was alright or could actually somewhat act. Overall it's a mediocre movie that I probably wouldn't watch again unless I want to know what is going on when the sequels come out, but I doubt it since the franchise is now finished.6.6/10",6,0,0,18 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Missing so much, but a decent condensed adaptation of the book
","Now this is a movie in this franchise I can understand why so many stuff got cut from the novel. The 4th novel is just too freaking long to fit in one movie. The only way I can see how it can fit everything in the novel in one movie is to make it two parts like they did with 'Deathly Hallows'. And even than it probably wouldn't be enough probably. But maybe it should have been around 3 hours in order to fit as much of the stuff in the novel into the movie. Daniel Radcliffe didn't grow up so well, the younger version of Harry Potter was just simply more likable. Emma Watson on the other hand is growing up nicely and starting to get more likable. I still can't get used to Michael Gambon playing Albus Dumbledore. He just lacked the charisma and the certain aura the previous actor that passed away was able pull off the person you just have to respect presence. But most of all lacked the connection between the other characters. Not a fan of the books of this franchise, but I gotta admit this movie is missing a lot of creative and clever parts from the novel. But overall is a decent condensed version of the book that is worth a watch if you liked the book.7.2/10",7,0,0,19 July 2011
In Time," Well it had potential...Still not a bad movie
","This movie had a intriguing and interesting concept going for it but it just wasn't executed that well. It's still not a bad movie and is worth seeing at a dollar theater but unfortunately it just didn't reach the potential it should have reached. The ending is what really irritated me, the movie builds and builds and goes in a very clichÃ© and stupid direction at the end. Some parts just doesn't make any sense and there is some obvious plot holes that is just so noticeable. Movies like this can have a far-fetched premise but it should at least have somewhat of a believable direction which this does not. Again it's a wasted potential and could have been better, maybe if they at least made it a bit more believable and had better dialogue. Still it isn't a terrible movie and I didn't really regret seeing it and it isn't a complete waste of time. I give this movie a higher rating than I would have given it because I liked the music in it, especially the theme song. If only the movie was good as the music in it.6.5/10",6,0,1,7 January 2012
Thor," Pretty good superhero movie, just wasn't all that great.
","This is a pretty good superhero movie, but I just didn't think it was amazing like a lot of critics were claiming. Just from watching the trailer I knew what I am going to get out of this movie, which really wasn't a super high expectation. And I got basically the exact amount of it, the direction of the movie is alright and has a bit of the comic book feel to it. And although when I first heard the announcement for this movie I thought it was going to suck. Mainly because I didn't expect a movie about a marvel hero that didn't really stand out all that much and didn't have enough in his character to make a movie out of and actually be good. But overall it did a pretty good job and the movie was entertaining with some good CGI fight sequences. The comic relief part seemed slightly forced but that isn't really anything to complain about and for the most part it works. The chemistry in this movie seemed to work but there wasn't enough development in the characters. The plot isn't anything special either nor did it really grab my attention or had anything really gripping or even exciting. This is far from being a bad superhero movie and has some good aspects to it, even if it has it's flaws it had some entertaining parts.7.3/10",7,0,2,27 June 2011
The Happening," M. Night Shyamalan similar premise, just done better before
","The story here is that something has been released into the air which causes people to stop moving, talk gibberish and walk backwards and after they decide to kill yourself. Throughout this awkward situation Elliot Moore a character played by Mark Wahlberg who is a high school teacher tries to get his wife in a safe area. I didn't think this was a bad movie, I mean it's not brilliant but it's worth a look. The problem was that when this film came out people just had way too much high expectation for it, thinking that it will be a big smash hit summer movie M. Night Shyamalan past reputation and since it's his first rated R movie which don't really need to be rated R. It's a mediocre with a average dialogue and a dull ending, nothing was spectacular but will keep you interested at least it did for me. If people watched this expecting a indie film, they probably wouldn't be too harsh on it. The premise of this film was good with a decent beginning but a terrible finish.6/10",6,2,4,20 October 2009
The Untouchables," Entertaining and watchable movie but has it's flaws
","This isn't the most realistic movie about a team of cops trying to take down the bad guys. But I can see why this movie was such a entertaining and cool movie that left an impact in the 80's. The plot is loosely based on a true story about a Federal Agent Eliot Ness(Kevin Costner) and his team taking down Al Capone(Robert De Niro) a notorious gangster that resided in Chicago and this flick takes place in the 1930's. Sean Connery is the one is the one that stands out the most in this film as Eliot's partner Jimmy Malone(Sean Connery) I would also add De Niro but his scenes are just too few. But than again De Niro has just about always been great at playing the gangster roles. Despite the lack of substance this movie does have that heroic vibe going for it with few riveting moments probably because of the uplifting musical score. And it's a entertaining and cool movie and I can see why this movie was somewhat of a hit when it came out. It has tough guys with fedora hats, suits with trench coats wielding Tommy guns. And it does have a decent narrative even if it isn't a very intelligent movie. This movie tries to put Eliot Ness on a pedestal but I just found Ness to not be all that likable character in this. Maybe it's because he claims it doesn't matter if alcohol is a harmless drink or not, it's the law of the land to not consume it. Then he goes bending the law in order to take down the bad guys. If it was cocaine or other very harmful drugs I would give him a pass but not really in this case. But he was one of the few cops that couldn't be bought, bribed or bargained with and I give him props for that. Also all the character are mostly one dimensional and very underdeveloped. It's a entertaining and watchable flick but just didn't stand out all that much and does have some really dumb parts or parts that doesn't make much sense.7.4/10",7,0,1,22 April 2013
The Matrix Reloaded," Ruins the mythology but cool action sequences
","This movie basically ruined the mythology of 'The Matrix'. I know it can be difficult for a movie to beat it's predecessor, especially if the original is invigorating and awesome while being a visual feast with substance. The main problem with this one is that it lacks a lot of substance and to make up for that it has a lot of cool action scenes. Now the actions sequences is really cool and because of that this movie is worth watching. The music in this fits the premise of the movie and mixes well with the action to the point it can get addicting to listen to. If it pulled some surprises or unexpected elements it might have added to the value of this movie but that isn't the case The philosophical elements isn't intriguing or engaging to listen to but seemed forced at times. In fact when there is no action on screen the movie becomes very lame to watch. Especially the when it comes to the part revolving Zion. Overall this is a cool action oriented movie that lacks the substance that the first one has. But if you want to see some really cool action sequences with some cool music, you will probably be entertained to some degree with this one.6.7/10",6,0,1,22 December 2012
Mystic River," Some people just has some memories they just want to forget
","This movie is based on a novel by Dennis Lehane, not book to novel is rarely all that successful. And the novel is usually better than the movie, but this movie is a excellent adaptation to novel. It has great acting with believable emotions and is directed very well with dark and blue/cold like cinematography. So the plot revolves around three character Jimmy(Sean Penn), Sean(Kevin Bacon) and Dave(Tim Robbins). When they were kids and was playing Dave gets kidnapped and had horrendous things done to him. Which damages him mentally and emotionally. And than the movie goes to when they are adults now and Jimmy's daughter goes missing...Clint Eastwood did a excellent job with the casting cause all the actors put there A game with the roles they are given. Kevin Bacon is basically Kevin Bacon. But Sean Penn now he brings out a believable character who is a tough guy that doesn't take crap from anyone. So you can only imagine what happens when his daughter goes missing. Well until you watch this movie. He is a very emotional tough guy that is all I can say. Now when it comes to Tim Robbins he was just perfect for this role, he played a character that is suppose to be damaged very very well. It was just all believable all around, even if it can get a bit too melodramatic near the end. There is a lot of detective work that goes on in this and everything is so engaging with some amazing acting to the point you start to sort of feel for the characters. It just makes you want to focus more and more as this movie progresses. It just has some crazy and yet plausible twist and turns that you as the audience probably won't be able to predict. Overall this is a Clint Eastwood thriller masterpiece.9/10",9,1,1,7 July 2012
Zombieland," Time to nut up or shut up
","This is a good zombie flick with some humor thrown in, in fact it's basically a zombie road movie. It was fun from the beginning with the flashy opening to the end, with it's unique comical style and it even has a great cameo. Okay so the whole zombie apocalypse happens in Texas, from some sort of mad cow disease that spreads to everyone else. But the character that is focused on is Columbus played by Jesse Eisenberg, who everyone seems to call Michael Cera 2, and the main reason how he manages to survive for so long is cause he stays by these set of rules he abides by thanks to his phobias and nerdy lifestyle. But the real fun begins when Columbus teams up with Tallahassee(Woody Harrelson) who has no rules but the exterminate every zombie that gets in his way and his also has a obsession with twinkies. A bit of romance is thrown in as well with Wichita(Emma Stone) who has a sister named Little Rock(Abigail Breslin), I found these two girls pretty annoying throughout the movie and didn't agree with the knight in shining armor routine Columbus pulls near the end. But it led to some zombie mayhem so it's completely forgivable. The main complaint for me though, is that I actually wanted a bit more zombie mayhem in this but I guess I will have to wait for the sequel. Still a good zombie road movie, definitely worth checking out.8/10",8,0,0,15 February 2010
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Magical faithful adaptation to the novel, much better than the previous movie in this franchise
","This is actually a good adaptation from novel to movie. It has just about every part in the book although it lacks a bit of the satire, the execution of the movie seemed way more better this time. It seemed like a actual movie instead of a high budget live Saturday morning show for kids. It seemed like a actual movie instead of looking cheap and lame like the previous movie. Also was able to watch this from one sitting. The big budget is used well in this, especially when it comes to the special effects for 2002. Also all the good parts in the book is in this movie, in fact this stays flawlessly with the novel all the way too the end. Which is great, so overall it's a faithful adaptation. However the acting seemed to have gotten worse at times, especially the person that plays Harry Potter. If your a fan of the novel there is a high chance you will probably like this sequel.7.5/10",7,0,0,18 July 2011
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Script is passable and overall so is the whole movie
","I liked how this movie didn't take itself seriously and it's one of those movies that if you can accept for what it is you will have a good time watching it. Sure the dialogue and the character interactions didn't seem that believable and there wasn't much chemistry between the actor and the actress but that is besides the point. There was hardly any dull moment in this movie and from beginning to end it was mostly entertaining, even if there is hardly any character development. From what I seen in the trailer, I can say I got what I wanted out of it. Yeah the plot has some holes in it and super ridiculous for the most part, but it didn't bother me to the point it got irritating. It's not a thinking movie and it doesn't really explore more on certain premises or take advantage of it, but it's still a entertaining one.7.2/10",7,0,3,29 January 2011
Die Hard," One of the best action movies
","This is one of the best action movies ever made and it still holds up today. And influenced other action movies that came after it. This one really gives more of the everyday guy, someone you can relate with that gets put in a dire situation and must become of a badass. And he is a sarcastic guy that ticks off the bad guys and has punchlines but he is still a likable badass. He even gets bloodied up and bruised up during the process. Unlike those Steven Seagal movies where he hardly had a scratch after taking on dozens or even tons of bad guys. The build up is good and when the action kicks in, it's entertaining from start to finish. In fact this is probably the movie that really kick started Bruce Willis's career in the film industry as John McClane. The whole movie, well most of the action at least takes place within a tall building. And it's cool to see John McClane using every resource he has to fight the villains that takes over the building and holds onto hostages. And it's entertaining to see how everything plays out. Even the main villain Hans Gruber who is the leader of the pack played by Alan Rickman. He is this sophisticated and yet very methodical villain that keeps his cool no matter how bad the situation gets for his team. Overall this is a kickass action movie that has just about all the right elements to be engaging and entertaining movie.8.8/10",8,1,2,18 February 2013
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," Gives new meaning to sequels sucking
","I will start of by saying this movie is utter crap from beginning to end. The first movie in this franchise was pretty good with a passable story and direction, that isn't the case for this one. The direction is so annoying it almost becomes unbearable. The people that wrote the script to this must have not given any thought, because the plot and direction is very terrible. This movie is a insult to the audiences viewing it, it was sad to hear couple of my friends say this is a enjoyable movie when we saw it in theater. There was just way too many plot holes in this movie and the plot holes become so annoying because they are too obvious and there are a lot of them in this. Sequels tend to suck but this movie has no excuse, it had a huge budget and there was almost no thought that was gone into writing a good or even a decent script. The build up, climax and conclusion was all terribly done. The reason I am giving this movie a 4 is because of few of the good fight sequences. I give zero credit to Micheal Bay for this but only to the people that worked on the special effects. I could care less about Shia LaBeouf character in this and Megan Fox was just there to make the male audience drool over, she has become a sex symbol. Micheal Bay literally decided to go Micheal Baywatch with her in this. Some people that liked this movie a lot might say 'turn your brain off while watching this' and even goes as far as to bash on people that give the right review and make legit negative criticism. After watching this horrendous piece of crap movie it seems those people had a major brain damage before or after watching this flick. This movie is most definitely a pass, but to anyone that really want to check this out, just skip to the robot battle sequences. It don't matter how big of a fan Linkin Park is of of the Transformers, it's sad to hear there music is played for this garbage, not that there new stuff is great or anything like that. The special effects was good and I give props to the team that worked on it, but no credit will go to Micheal Bay for this. The action sequences should be a part of a movie for these type of genre, but for this one that is the only thing that just slightly saves this movie from just getting a 1 for me.4/10",4,2,7,2 July 2011
The Witch," Not as disturbing as it should be
","This is a horror movie without much substance or much tension really. What makes it stand out though is the atmosphere and the cinematography. How it just doesn't try to go into that generic Hollywood horror flick genre direction. However this needed to take the rawness to another level. Because it felt like the director was holding back in certain areas and lacked the gut-wrenching moments that it needed. The trailer made this movie seem more terrifying than it really is. I think going in a more art-house direction with more surreal elements would have really benefited this film. It's like the director had one foot in and one foot out when it came to making a genuinely raw film. This movie tries to give the audience an illusion of suspense and tension. Despite there being few haunting imagery, when it comes to this movie as a whole it comes off lacking when it comes to making it a engraving experience. Overall, it had potential to be a really haunting and visceral experience but faltered. Instead it just came off as a bleak and nihilistic movie.3.6/10",3,3,7,1 May 2016
When Harry Met Sally...," Clever and witty romantic comedy
","This really is a enjoyable witty romantic comedy, from the dialogue to the direction it's all very witty and fun to watch the characters exchange dialogue with each other. This movie starts off with a good amount of impact and for the most part it keeps the impact all the way through it. The relationship this time in this romantic comedy is about two friends one guy and one girl building a relationship by teaching each other about relationship. One from guy's point of view the other from a girl's point of view and it's mostly witty and entertaining to watch these two biker and argue in a mostly friendly manner. Harry Burns(Billy Crystal) just didn't seem like a good match with the beautiful Sally Albright(Meg Ryan) but the chemistry is believable and good to the point it's all mostly passable. Plus it just proves that it's not about all looks when it comes to women. Billy Crystal played the obnoxious and yet likable character really well. The comic relief is also clever and it's a breath of fresh air, it can be enjoyed by almost anyone and has aspects of it that can be discussed with friends after it's finished. Highly recommend this to almost anyone, especially for those that like romantic comedies.8.2/10",8,1,1,15 February 2011
Zero Dark Thirty," Watchable but not that entertaining or thrilling
","This movie might be more realistic I am not quite sure but 'The Hurt Locker' is a better movie in my opinion. I know Kathryn Bigelow wanted to go in a realistic direction when it comes down to taking down one of the world's biggest terrorist. But despite few moments overall it just wasn't all that entertaining or thrilling. It's kinda cool to see the lead protagonist grow more professional as the movie progresses since the story tries to cover 8 or 9 yrs. But most of it is just constant discussions on how to execute certain things from well thought out intuition and paper work. I didn't really feel much intensity from this flick. I can appreciate that they tried to make it realistic as possible without things constantly shoot outs or things constantly blowing up. But the movie just felt a bit dull. If you want those special tactics, tactical espionage or black ops type of movie this one really isn't it. Since a lot of people already know the news of what happened, it takes away from the anticipation as well. Since the build up isn't all that great. But the the take down at the end had quite a bit of thrills and intensity going for it. But overall this is a watchable but kinda mundane movie.6.5/10",6,2,7,11 February 2013
Crazy Heart," Country music lovers are going to enjoy this film even more
","I personally ain't a fan of country music, but those that do like it will probably enjoy this film even more. The plot is pretty straight forward and doesn't really do anything that will grab your attention spontaneously. It's basically a story about always drunk country singer and how he deals with his downfall and has some romance in it as well. And to be honest the movie is a bit dry and boring at times, cause it doesn't have that great of a dialogue or hardly any drama with intensity. But what really made this film is Jeff Bridges's solid and captivating performance playing the musician Bad Blake, it's a shame that Maggie Gyllenhaal put on such a boring performance even if it's just her character. Also the score is pretty good if your into country and all, if you don't it still ain't that bad. It's a good movie with some great performances, but if your just not into dry and slow paced style, you probably won't enjoy this as much. 7.3/10",7,1,2,11 April 2010
Hercules," Bland and narrow animated Disney flick
","I read that this movie doesn't stand true to the Greek Mythology, which doesn't really matter for me cause I have no interest in Greek Mythology much. I thought this movie was passable when I first saw it as a kid, nothing worth re-watching but just alright. However watching it now, it just seemed too simple and bland with almost no real substance. It didn't even appear like much effort was put into it, but to just make another animated Disney movie. Watching this was like watching another 3 episode of a animated TV show on Saturday. Everything is just so darn narrow and predictable that it really does take away from the experience. Not only that, even the hero is super bland and the supporting character adds more flavor to this movie. Overall this is a forgettable flick that is maybe worth a watch only if you are a kid.4.9/10",4,3,8,27 September 2014
Love Actually," Not amazing, but still delightful
","This film is about eight different couples that are going through struggles in there love life and somehow they intertwine with each other near the end. When I first found out how this film is going to be about 8 different couples I thought it was going to be a long movie, but it only show short segments of each and gets straight to the point on most parts. The ensemble case is mainly British actors and actresses and they all work pretty well. And the lives of the characters are all in good taste although most of it is more feminine ideals of romance, but I guess that is okay because of the flurry of very unrealistic romance movies out there. Although it wasn't a amazing film in my opinion it was still delightful and somewhat heartwarming.7.2/10",7,1,2,17 February 2010
12 Years a Slave," Graphic and heartbreaking
","I thought this was going to be a movie about how bad slavery is. And I had that yes, slavery is bad let move along mentality. However this film turned out to be more than that. Mainly because of the graphic and heartbreaking realism. And the acting of the tortured souls that had to go through a horrendous time. I have seen movies about slavery, but not as graphic as this one. However it must have been at least that brutal during those times for slaves. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Solomon a freeman that gets kidnapped and is forced into slavery. Chiwetel Ejiofor is just the right actor to play the naive and yet believable character in this film that is based on a true story. All the other actors put on a believable performance even the ones that played despicable characters. Minus Brad Pitt that is hardly even in the movie and puts on some acting chops of his that is really starting to get old. Anyways it seems he signed up for this role in order to play the hero once again. Which is understandable, but it is far from being stand out role for him. Now I am not one of those that gives a good review for a movie just because of the content, but this movie really does gripped me with it's harsh realism. This is a historical film that actually deserves the film awards.8.3/10",8,0,1,19 April 2014
Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist," Fun experience
","This film is just about a chance encounter with Nick and Norah who are music buffs, and they embark on a journey through NY with a literally gay indie band to find a secret show of a legendary band. I didn't have high expectations for this film, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. Although just about everyone in this film seems like they are from a alternative universe with obnoxious hipster everywhere and portray gay people as being special and make a big deal out of it. The characters in the film the filmmakers want you to hate, and you end up really loathing them. This film is definitely worth a look, especially if your watching it with your gf or friends. Michael Cera been playing the same character for just about every movie he is in, but his character fit very well in this role and actually funny. What I enjoyed the most of about this film is the atmosphere it just felt magical and the film doesn't try really hard to be great, it is what it is but it's still enjoyable. This is a good teen comedy that is worth a look, it's a fun little love story. Oh and how does Aaron Yoo still look like a high school student? 7.3/10",7,0,0,20 October 2009
30 Days of Night," It's a good survival horror vampire movie but nothing great
","When I first saw this movie in theaters I thought it was a great vampire movie. But seeing it now, it's just alright. It's entertaining but not as great as I once thought it was. Vampires in this is portrayed as savage creatures like beings that is just wild and crazy. Far from being civilized or methodical while doing some malicious actions. They just see humans and chase after them like wild animals. Which is kinda cool but they seemed more like zombies in a way, well zombies that run. The story takes place in Barrow, Alaska during a period where it's 30 days of night. And most of the movie is about the towns folks trying to run, hide and fight back. Josh Hartnett is in this as the Sheriff of the town but it felt like just about anyone else could have played his role. I mean he fit the role but nothing that really stood out. It's a good adaptation to the comic it's based on. And it's entertaining but it's not all that great. Or had any real shock factors or anything all that amazing for a vampire flick. It's a good survival horror movie. Also you know those movies where multiple people gather in a group and there is a high chance of survival if they stick together. But one person ruins it for everyone by saying they can't take it anymore and tries to leave. Well that is in this one and it gets pretty annoying to watch those kinds of scenarios.7/10",7,3,5,11 February 2013
Sausage Party," Maybe I am getting old...
","Yeah, this is probably the first American CGI animated rated R movie that hit theaters that I have seen. But I just found this flick to be mundane despite the over the top immaturity. The cast of 'This is the End' got baked started having philosophical discussions while goofing off with foods and appliances while watching 'Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!' and 'The Brave Little Toaster'. That is probably how the script of this movie came about. The journey is quite straightforward and predictable. With tons of food puns that beat out 'Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2' except it leans more into sexual metaphors. Maybe if I was 12 I might have been amused with this, but now it just felt bored sitting through this. I just didn't get a kick out of the over the top and crude humor with this one. I can however see how some teens will have a lot of laughs while watching this.5/10",5,0,4,20 November 2016
There Will Be Blood," Sort of boring epic film, but with flawless performances
","Daniel Day-Lewis was just phenomenal in this movie in fact without him there will be a lot of sleeping audiences. As a matter of fact this actor basically made the movie, he played the role of the very greedy and rotten man with a lot of ambitions flawlessly. This is a epic movie but a boring one as well, but thanks to Daniel Day-Lewis this film really is but to some degree still pretty darn engrossing. This is one of those films that isn't for everyone, but it does have it's target audiences. The premise of this movie is greed and greed spreads in this film, starting from Daniel Day-Lewis's character who is a oil tycoon. Now I praised Daniel Day-Lewis's performance in this, it's time to move onto Paul Dano who plays the preacher kid. Now this guy was very intriguing to watch and entertaining as well, besides Day-Lewis he put on a performance that really made this boring movie watchable. This movie is about acting and Paul Dano can act, he was really incredible in this. Just make sure to be fully awake when watching this cause it can put you to sleep, but it's a film worth watching. Daniel manipulates the town's people with prosperity while Eli counters that with manipulation of faith and the clash between these two characters drives the film as well. This is a actors movie, and if you want to see amazing acting with a slightly entertaining and yet engrossing plot, like I said this film is worth watching.7.9/10",7,0,1,17 February 2011
Man on Fire," Tad bit tedious at times and lacks a bit of substance, still gritty good
","This movie is basically about a man with nothing to lose, trying to save a girl that got kidnapped for ransom. Sure it does have some over the top sequences, but overall it was a pretty realistic movie. Denzel Washington is very charismatic in this movie, like his other past movies and is pretty much a badass that will do whatever it takes to save a little girl's life. The plot starts off pretty well and the violence that is done upon the bad guys in this is more than satisfying. But I couldn't help but get bored a few times, cause it feels like body count after body count with the main character Creasy(Denzel Washington) tracking down up bad guy, gets information and moves on to the next bad guy. Which I wouldn't really complain about if it didn't come off as a tad bit boring and dull. It also feels formulaic sometimes as well, but I did like the gritty and realistic aspect of the film. Especially enjoyed Creasy getting his hands dirty to reach his goal of finding the little girl. Overall the movie had plenty of potential and could have been a amazing movie about revenge/redemption/kidnapping, but felt it lacked substance and story for a film that is over 140 min. Despite some flaws there is also many positive aspects in this film as well.7.5/10",7,0,1,16 October 2010
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," What really is crazy?
","At first the plot may seem like it's a bonding story between bunch of crazy people in a mental institution but it's more than that. The movie does a very good job with the elements in this type of genre that you grow attach to the characters and has a new feel to it even if it's been done before. The movie was made before I was even born but it's still a good cinematic experience. The movie has some interesting scenarios mainly how it would be like if you put a rebellious smart alek that influences the other patients around him. This movie is simply intriguing from beginning to end. The story and everything flowed very well and how the main protagonist slowly start to breakdown the system was entertaining and yet uplifting like some reviewers claim it to be. Oh and Jack Nicholson is really good in this and pulls off his role really well. And I liked his character in this, because although he isn't a good person but he has a bit of kindness to him in this, even if there is a chance he might be crazy. The interactions and reactions will grab your attention and is one of the factors that drives this movie. I recommend this movie to people that enjoy movies.8.3/10",Null,0,1,19 September 2011
Edge of Tomorrow," Cleverly constructed and entertaining
","This is one of those movies that has high-tech special effects, but combines it with a clever story and direction. It's another movie about humans fighting against a alien race, but the story is just so darn well thought out and clever when it comes to the scenarios. That it actually stands out among other movies of this type. When it comes to the story, it's actually based on a novel called 'All You Need Is Kill'. The story is like a mix of 'Groundhog Day' and a alien invasion movie with mech like suits. For a storyline like this it needs quite a bit of creativity or it gets redundant fast. Fortunately, the creativity of the similar scenarios is what drives this movie. It mixes the right amount of humor and the serious tone of this movie which doesn't go off track. Tom Cruise is a good actor and he is especially good playing these characters that gets built from ground up. I personally think he is a better actor for these sci-fi movies than Will Smith. The action is entertaining and the direction and scenarios are captivating to the point that I would highly recommend this movie to any sci-fi movie fans. Sure there are few plot-holes, but they seem to have at least have tries to make a interesting and intelligent film. You will have a blast with this one.8.8/10",8,0,2,17 August 2014
Whiplash," Sensational!
","This has got to be one of the most impactful, inspiring and humanistic film I have seen in a long time. From the start to finish, it was breathtaking and emotional to sit through. Because of the cinematography that builds tension and the direction that brings about that captivating and compelling feeling. You can almost literally feel the emotions poring out of the characters. This movie revolves around the human ambition for greatness and how not everyone is how they seem. This is just simply a sensation film making from start to finish and it really had my attention all the way through. Certain people need that kick in the rear to focus and get started, but the question is how much pushing can some people take. I guess if they want it enough they can handle it, because the end justify the means for them. Watching this film was sort of like a more artistic and powerful portrayal of how Gordon Ramsay treats his chefs on television. Except Ramsay is probably doing it for rating and publicity stunt. Although certain portion of him makes him do that, it's mostly for the ratings. Overall, this is a film that really hits the core with it's emotions and intensity. I highly recommend it. The techinical aspect of this film when it comes to the music, instruments, direction and cinematography with some fantastic acting trutly brings this film to life.9.8/10",9,1,2,9 August 2015
Army of Darkness," 'Hail to the King, Baby'
","It's not good as 'Evil Dead 2' but it's still a fun humorous wacky movie with a bit of horror(well when it comes to the surroundings anyways). This doesn't really have that scare factor compared to the first two, but instead it brings out the crazy, humorous and wacky elements way more this time around. And it takes place in the Medieval Ages I think. Even though this one doesn't really have much to do with the previous installments it's still has that flare going for it. sure it's one of those movies that is the epitome of just going with the flow. Because a lot of it is random or doesn't make much sense. But if you can just go with it, you can enjoy this. What really drives this movie though is Bruce Campbell reprising his role as Ash. His goofy, silly and wackiness while also being a badass brings a lot to this movie. And gives a incentive to root for his side. Although it can be cheesy at times it's still a very fast-paced and entertaining film. Overall it's a ridiculous movie that is so good.7.9/10",7,3,4,2 August 2013
Scream 2," Whats your favorite scary movie? Again
","It still brings out the generic slasher flick elements in a taunting manner and sort of makes a joke out of them. Or at least makes references to those horror movies. Which I found to be one of the key factors of why the 'Scream' franchise to be popular. At least it was the factor that I enjoyed in the first 'Scream' movie with it's horror movie rules and such. And was one of the reason why it stood out from being just another generic slasher flick. However this time it's less clever from the previous movie, not that the previous 'Scream' was all that clever and this time it's way more silly. Like one of the quote from this movie 'sequels suck' 'they are inferior films' I wouldn't say this movie sucked, but it's inferior to the first 'Scream'. But I really liked how this makes references to the first 'Scream' movie, it's the most intriguing part of this movie. And although it's inferior, it's still a satisfying sequel. There is more body counts this time around, but that doesn't necessarily a good thing for slasher flicks all the time. This film although puts more emphasis on who's the killer aspect, but it just isn't that engaging for the audience. What I found really absurd about this movie is how, although the scenarios for the killer is coincidental it always goes according to the way the killer wants it to. Decent sequel but just wasn't as sharp as the first 'Scream'. I am going to give this movie a 5.6 because the movie becomes just way too stupid to the point it becomes irritating near the end.5.6/10",5,0,2,16 April 2011
Die Hard with a Vengeance," 2nd best in this franchise so far
","This is the 2nd best installment in this franchise so far, unless 'Die Hard 6' pulls something out of this world. It's exciting and fast paced all around. Sure it's probably the most implausible 'Die Hard' movie out of all of them which is saying something. But the thing is, it's still entertaining. And it didn't get to the point where it got annoying or irritating to watch and that includes the random coincidences throughout this flick. Bruce Willis is back as John McClane and he still has all that characteristics John McClane. Who is this tough smartass that taunts his enemies no matter what situation he is in and is a badass while doing what he does best. And this time around he has a real partner, not really a sidekick but a partner. Who goes by the name of Zeus Carver and is played by Samuel L. Jackson. Who is a black version of McClane but isn't as physical but still more patient and to a degree more intellectual. And he is a badass as well. And it was cool to see them go around New York City 'Grand Theft Auto' style trying to save innocent civilians from bombs and take down the bad guys. The main villain this time is Simon(Jeremy Irons) and he is just great in this role. In fact he is probably the 2nd best villain so far in this franchise. He is like the The Riddler from BTAS and Bane from 'The Dark Knight Rises'. Well not the complete package from both of those villains but a little of both. In fact it would have been cool if the ending went in a different direction. The way one of the writers decided to end the movie. So maybe they could have picked it back up in 'Die Hard 5'. This is directed by the same director that directed the first 'Die Hard' which is why a lot of the elements that made the first 'Die Hard' awesome is still intact. Overall if your a action movie fan this is a one that is really worth seeing.8/10",8,0,0,21 February 2013
August Rush," Oliver Twist like story with music that touches the heart
","Watching this movie is like watching a 'Oliver Twist' story with some great, emotional and even inspirational music. Except the parents of the little boy Oliver Twist well actually Evan or August Rush has parents that are both musicians that are looking for August. And the plot is basically about a boy named Evan/August Rush that feels music and is a musical prodigy. And through music he is trying to find his loved ones, which is his parents. Now this would have been a amazing movie if the heartfelt and emotional aspects had a bit more substance to it. And didn't so artificial or forced at times. It basically feels like a fairy tale where certain parts just seemed a bit too coincidental. But it's to bring out that bonding moments between certain characters and if it did try to go in a fairytale-esque direction. Or tries to go with that 'Oliver Twist' vibe it's understandable I guess. But it just seemed a bit too cheesy and just not a very believable dialogues between characters and just seemed forced at times. Despite that the music really does bring about quite a bit of emotions. And so props go to the composers for this movie. It's worth a rental and a watch but it's not a movie I would want to watch over and over again.7.3/10",7,1,1,10 April 2013
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," A overrated movie that boosted Will Ferrell's career
","Personally I think this is a overrated comedy. It has it's moments although very few, but it just lacks when it comes to the comedic value. The jokes are just immature, immature jokes are alright if it's funny. But I wasn't amused or even found it to be funny. It seemed like the whole cast was trying really hard to be funny, but it falls flat. This is basically the movie that boosted Will Ferrell's career with his continuous man-child trademark. Maybe I am missing something, but it just seemed like this movie mashed bunch of random skits together. While having the core of the story for the sake of just being there, because they needed a story. Now this can also work in a way where it can be entertaining, but not in this one. Personally my favorite scene is the cat poop scene which was added into the deleted scenes. There really isn't any unexpected things going on in this flick and just comes off very predictable and quickly becomes tiresome. It's not a awful movie, but it's a very overrated one.4.5/10",4,0,0,30 December 2013
The Mission," Powerful movie about fighting for what is right or showing love and mercy
","This is a powerful movie that questions the morals of what is right and what is wrong. In this case if it's right to fight for what is just or to try to solve everything by love and mercy. I found this movie to be slightly dry but it got my interest most of the way through. Mostly because it is based on a true story. About a man that falls and later becomes a Christian and later fights for what he believes is right instead of what he only wants. So in this case he is fighting for the peaceful tribe of Christians. I just wish the movie was a bit more developed and explain certain parts of the movie. Such as how the tribe got evangelized after the beginning scene. All the actors did a great job, in fact it has actors that will play some big roles in future movies after this. Such as Robert De Niro, Jeremy Irons, and Liam Neeson. This is not a movie I would watch repeatedly but it's a powerful movie that questions the morals of what is right and wrong. I personally had to agree with Robert De Niro's character in this movie. I thought the movie however ended too abruptly and a better development would have made this movie better.7.3/10",7,2,3,2 December 2011
The Reader," Bonding and the study of human psychology
","Although it wasn't powerful or riveting as I thought it would be, it's still a alright film. Ralph Fiennes, David Kross, and Kate Winslet was perfect for there roles, especially Kate and glad they didn't cast her role with some other actress. The film has to do with a boy reading to a grown woman and build a relationship because of it and crimes committed during Nazi occupation that comes back, for redemption although Kate Winslet's character didn't seem to feel much guilt for most part. Like she said, she was only following orders, plus others that were involved much more gets off with a way lighter sentence. And during Kate Winslet's characters prison term is when Ralph Fiennes becomes her reader once again, and helps her through the time she has left behind bars. The movies has some wonderful moments, but a it's a very slow paced film to the point it can get a big annoying sometimes, and parts of it seem to drag on and on. But overall it's a decent drama with some good performances, it could have been better if it was a bit more faster paced and the script had a bit more to offer.7.5/10",7,0,0,22 April 2010
The Wrestler," Depressing but touching film
","This is a brutal and realistic film about a guy named Randy(Mickey Rourke) who is trying to support himself by being in a amateur wrestling but he is also getting old, and he hurts himself every time he tries to make a few bucks. But he is also a honest man and the character that Mickey Rourke plays is honest and likable, so you can't help but feel sympathy for the guy with his hardships. A lot of aspects of this film is pretty realistic especially the wrestling sequences with Randy 'The Ram' and every time he gets on the mat it is actually cringe worthy. And while struggling he tries to build a bond with a stripper named Cassidy(Marisa Tomei) and become a better father to his daughter Stephanie(Evan Rachel Wood). As the movie progresses I just couldn't help but feel for Randy, which made the whole scenario even more depressing to watch. The performances was amazing especially from Mickey Rourke, I couldn't tell if he was acting or not, which made the gritty scenes even grittier. I got what I expected from this film and more.8/10",8,0,0,15 February 2010
Dark Shadows," Predictable and dull but still watchable
","Johnny Depp playing a vampire in that takes place in the 70's seems like a cool idea. And I gotta admit when I saw the trailer to this movie I wasn't super excited or anything like that but thought it just might have potential. But this isn't anything special and is a flick that is easily forgettable. It starts out alright with the intro and all but soon gets dull afterwards. Now Depp is pretty good with his role as a vampire that got locked up for almost 200 yrs to wake up in the 70's. In fact it's a role that he suggested to Tim Burton, well him wanting to play a vampire at least. Even if you didn't know this is a Tim Burton movie, you can pretty much tell right off the bat. Although a lot of his movie are like this, but this story direction that has Tim Burton all over it gets tiresome. The style of it is alright, but there is almost no development when it comes to a lot of the characters. Now I am not really a big Tim Burton fan or anything like that but it seems he just focused putting way too much of his style into this movie. With Gothic elements and stuff that the focus didn't seem to have gone much when it came to the script. The quirky humor sometimes works but it just seemed forced sometimes. Cause most of the humor in this movie comes from Barnabas Collins(Johnny Depp) not necessarily being able to live through almost 200 yrs from being locked up and times have really changed for him. Thus most of the humor comes from his fascination and how he perceives certain things that are in the 70's. Even the set pieces and background didn't entirely seem all that 70's as well besides hippies, lava lamp, a certain singer and such. The idea seems decent for this flick but when it comes down to it all, there really isn't anything original about this and just about everything is pretty much predictable. It's watchable but still a forgetful film. Also some critics seem to bash on Eva Green's performance saying it's too over the top. But it worked for this movie since it made the scenes she is in less dull.5.6/10",5,1,2,1 July 2012
Kingpin," Funny, but not downright hilarious
","Roy Munson(Woody Harrelson) is a bowling prodigy and wins the 1979 Iowa state amateur championship and plans to leave his hometown to make it big by going on a Professional Bowlers Tour. But his dreams comes to a halt when he comes across Ernie McCracken(Bill Murray) who tricks Roy and uses him as a pawn while Ernie runs off with all the money he got from conning. The angry people that got conned takes there anger out on Roy, and he gets his hand amputated. Yrs later Roy who was a innocent boy has a hook for a hand now where he used to bowl with and is now a con man himself, since he is in debt with the landlady and soon is forced to have unwanted sex with her. But a ray of hope comes for Roy when he meets Ishmael who is a talented bowler himself and tries to recruit him for the $1,000,000 winner-take-all tournament in Reno, Nevada. The thing is Ishmael is a Amish boy. This film was a bit darker than I expected and flows with some crude and rude humor, but it's actually quite funny at times, despite it being a bit dark. And the humor in this might offend some people even if it's not the most repulsive comedy out there or even comes close but since it sort of seem like a kid friendly comedy some may get offended. This is a funny road movie, that will keep you laughing or at least grinning in some scenes. It wasn't the most hilarious movie I ever seen but I got some good laughs out of it. The direction the creators went with this is ambiguous and isn't the stereotypical and predictable comedy, and the ending did not sit right with me and sort of made me angry. But it just shows the reality of life even if a lot of this film is down right outrageous. Soon Claudia(Vanessa Angel) is in the group as well, but I found her character more annoying than funny, she is a whore and that is the bottom line no matter what she does at the end. It just wasn't believable and it seemed like she had some other ulterior motives or just forced. I don't know about anyone else but I don't particularly think that a girl that constantly act like a hooker throughout the whole movie to be attractive. Plus in my opinion she has a butter face but maybe I am shallow. And to top it off she wasn't sexy even if some do disagree, she was only on the ride for the money and that is basically the main thing she saw at the end as well, cause her character change was just not believable. Especially since the characters are more serious compared to other comedies where the characters seem to be from another planet or just way too bizarre, stupid and retarded which sometimes adds to the comedic value, but that ain't the case for this film. I found how they turn any serious situation that are suppose to be dull into something funny which is a nice touch. Just about the entire cast was special and put on a great and funny performance. So it's a funny comedy with some crude and rude humor, just nothing downright hilarious and the comedy in this seemed a bit tacky sometimes.7.2/10",7,0,3,1 November 2009
Hancock," Didn't match the hype but it's watchable
","This movie delves into the more human aspect of superheroes. Where it shows the characters flaws and all that. And I thought Will Smith did a fairly good job playing a hero that just doesn't give much of a crap all that much. Now did it meet my expectations when I first saw this movie in theaters...Not really. But it's a very watchable movie that delves into a superheroes loneliness and overcoming his demons and emotional obstacles. While dealing with publicity and the public eyes that are on him. Over fighting a arch nemesis, rival or just villains in general. The progression of the story and characters was sadly mediocre though, and I just didn't find it all that entertaining or amusing to watch. But the movie does have it's moments when it comes to Hancock just being human with superpowers although it didn't really delve into it in a impactful manner or anything like that. Overall, it's watchable but just didn't match the hype when it was released.6.5/10",6,0,1,21 October 2015
Hitch," How we're all 'realists masquerading as cynics who are secretly optimists'?
","When I first saw this movie as a kid, I didn't think much of it and thought it was just another cute comedy. Now seeing it again as an adult, I could appreciate it more. Mainly because of the concept behind it all, when it comes to attraction and being able to be bold enough to get what you want out of life. Sure, some parts of it is quite far-fetched and I didn't think it was entirely accurate. Especially the ending, which felt a bit too generic and tacked on in order to make it work as another Hollywood rom-com. Usually in these types of movies there can be dozen other actors or actresses that can be able to play the lead role. But Will Smith just nails it to the point you will believe this role was for him only. The female lead is played by Eva Mendes who was at her peak of popularity when this movie came out. I guess she was alright, not a very likable character in my opinion. Which is one of the reasons why I don't get why the protagonist would fall for her. But then again beauty is in the eyes of the beholder. Kevin James also fit his role in this really well and added to the comic elements. Overall this is a movie that is worth a watch, mainly because there is some empathy and understanding behind it for most male adults.7.8/10",7,0,0,12 June 2015
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Not saying much, but still the best in the first trilogy
","Despite the pretty disappointing Episode 1. This third installment is my favorite in the first trilogy. This is the movie that most of the fans was waiting for. How the Jedi Anakin joins the Dark Side and becomes Darth Vader. Sure the romance elements is corny once again and the manipulation elements in the story could have been executed better. But this was a fun action packed thrill ride from start to finish. The whole plot is basically about politics once again, backstabbing and manipulation. Again the flow of it and development of the story could have been more in-depth, but it's passable. The special effects even got a major upgrade and really makes watching the galactic battles much more appealing. I really didn't like Hayden Christensen playing Anakin the future Darth Vader. His expression was just so wooden and his portrayal was just more annoying than intimidating. And his character was more of a prick than an actual badass villain. The main redeeming quality of this movie is of course the lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and Anakin. Although the finishing didn't make much sense, like bunch of other parts in this Trilogy. However it still has the best lightsaber fight when it comes to Episode 1 through Episode 6. Not the most emotional or story driven but the most entertaining lightsaber fight when it comes to the execution. Although it ain't saying much this is the best Star Wars movie in the first Trilogy.7.8/10",7,0,3,18 September 2015
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," I give it credit for when this movie came out, but I was bored
","I really wanted to enjoy this flick. Maybe because it's probably Disney's first full length animated movie. I appreciated the animation and the details, especially because of the when this movie first came out. However I was bored to tears, during my childhood I use to watch a lot of Disney movies but this one just didn't stand out to me. It really plays upon a girl's dream of Prince Charming showing up and saving the day from all the troubles of the world. It's cool for when this movie came out, but that doesn't mean I have to act like I enjoyed it or anything like that. I can't call this a timeless masterpiece of anything like that, but I appreciate it. Since this movie was probably the pioneer for other good and great Disney films. I think the only thing that stood out for me when it comes to this flick was the 'Heigh Ho' part where the dwarfs are singing while going back home from mining. Overall, this is in my opinion a movie to watch in order to see the beginning of Disney and the animation, which was top notch at that time. No offence to Disney or others that liked this, but I personally was very bored with this one.5/10",5,1,12,16 September 2014
Inception," Hands down one of the best movie of 2010
","I just had to watch this movie at least 4 times and I very rarely do that for a movie. This is the movie I was looking to the most for 2010 and for the most part it lives up to the hype and beat my expectations. This is a very exhilarating film that intrigued me from the very first scene. This was basically one heck of a thrill ride that needs double viewing for some audience to get a full grasp of what is exactly going on. The plot is spectacular and very well written for the most part, what I really liked was how challenging it is and ballsy. Since the budget is high but by the script it just didn't seem like a movie for the mainstream audiences. The plot is basically about a team composed of people with the skills of their own to infiltrate a person's dream and commit a heist by planting a idea. Even by means of corporate espionage in order to do the task. One of the aspect I really liked was how the team is very likable although they are basically thieves. The team is composed of Dom Cobb aka The Extractor(Leonardo DiCaprio), Arthur aka The Point Man(Joseph Gordon-Levitt), Ariadne aka The Architect(Ellen Page), Eames aka The Forger(Tom Hardy), Yusuf aka The Chemist(Dileep Rao). There is one other that just tags along Mr. Saito aka The Tourist and the person the team's target which is Robert Michael Fischer aka The Mark, in another words he is the person the team is prepared to commit inception on. I must say The Point Man is my favorite character in this movie, he is sharp straight to the point and he handles even the most difficult task in a dream like another day just doing business. For this Christopher Nolan obviously borrowed some bits and pieces of ideas from other movies with similar premise, even anime. But it's blended and crafted so very well there really isn't much to complain about in that department. This movie is a visual brilliance almost everything about it is magnificent and highly intriguing with it's direction. But the thing is some may claim this is a intricate puzzle, but I am going to have to disagree. Maybe the first time seeing this it might seem like that, but this is m more of a movie built with it's complexity than a intricate puzzle. As a matter of fact most audience would have to watch this twice in order to get a grasp of everything that is going on. This can be the main problem for this movie to some degree. Although the complexity in this will make the audience think and thus be a challenging film, it is stacked with a bit too much info. Yes, it necessary to leave out any plot holes. But it spends a bit too much time explaining what is going on instead of getting to the core of the plot. Now if the explaining part wasn't the least bit intriguing this would have been a HUGE flaw, but the thing is it's intriguing. So it becomes a minor flaw, at least to me that is. Despite some minor flaws this is really a must watch movie, the visuals are even very innovative in this. There is almost no boring parts in this film and nothing seemed to really drag at all and the charming characters gave more to the movie. Films like this is like the reason I go out to watch movies in theaters, it really is brilliant in almost every way.8.9/10",8,0,9,15 March 2011
Lord of War," Very intriguing and entertaining film about a gunrunner
","From just the intro I could tell this was going to be a interesting movie. And for the most part it did and most aspects of this film is very well executed. For the most part the dialogue and the narration by Nicholas Cage's character clever and sharp for the most part. The plot is about a very good business man and has talent for being a very good sales man, but what he sells is weapons to different nations and regions. So basically he is a arms dealer who would trade with anyone as long as he got the big bucks for it. He is also sleazy at times and knows how to use people and just throw them away. So basically he is someone almost everyone would hate especially when he says stuff like 'there's nothing more expensive for an arms dealer than peace'. But you can't help but have slight respect for this character because of the way he accomplishes his tasks, it's just very sharp and entertaining to watch, also witty at times. This is one of those movies with the protagonist narrating almost everything through his success and failures. But is very well crafted to the point it got my attention for the most part. The timing and luck of this arms dealer can sort of take out of it's believability, but it's thrilling from the beginning to end. And how the greed of this arms dealer consumes him as the film progresses had my attention and kept my interest. Also Nicholas Cages performance wasn't just intriguing but conspicuous. Ethan Hawke has been good with the cop roles he has been getting and in this his performance is very well done as well playing Jack Valentine. A Interpol agent who is a clean and straight by the book type and doesn't take bribes no matter what. Basically one of the main problem for the main arms dealer in this movie.8.4/10",8,0,0,26 February 2011
Sherlock Holmes," I actually liked the bit of modern feel going for this...It wasn't ridiculous and added a bit of flare to it
","Some audiences has been bashing on this movie because it has that bit of a modern feel going for it. And I personally liked the modern feel to this movie, despite the time period this movie takes place. It just didn't seem like it went this direction because of the majority of audiences but because this added a bit of flare to it. Without it ruining the original books while reaching out to the mass audiences. This is a big case that Sherlock is trying to solve and a interesting one for the most part although it can be predictable at times. It isn't the most articulate and intelligent case ever, but it's decent. And just about anyone can understand exactly what is going on. Robert Downey Jr. was good as Sherlock Holmes although over-exaggerated at times and Jude Law was likable as Watson. They have a bit of a bromance going but they make a great duo and it's entertaining to watch them work together. Mark Strong does what he does best, playing a charismatic villain. Rachel McAdams is cute but she didn't really seem to fit her role as Irene Adler, she just seemed more girly than a seductive thief. She wasn't bad but just didn't seem to suit the role she is given all that well. When it came to Sherlock I enjoyed watching how he constantly used his senses and intuition using his surroundings and environment to get closer to finding out what is going on. Anyways to sum it up this movie has style but also has a bit of substance as well, it has enough action and mystery to keep the mass audiences entertained.7.7/10",Null,0,0,19 September 2011
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," A powerful war movie made in Korea
","This is probably the first large scale war movie that is made by a Korean director. And it's well directed and shows how war is hell, especially when it comes to watching your loved ones suffer because of the casualties of war. This movie focuses on two brothers that gets forced into fighting a war against the North Koreans. I am not sure if this is based on a true story of a certain survivor. But the direction this goes makes it believable that it could have happened. It's the director's first war movie so some flaws can be understandable, but the cinematography is very choppy at times to the point it can get annoying to watch sometimes. And not choppy in a way where it brings out the chaos of war but it just seemed choppy without adding certain elements that make shaky cam work SOMETIMES. But overall the battle scenes are well shot with the low budget they had for a movie of this kinda scale. The two main protagonist and brothers in this movie is played by Jang Dong-Gun who is the older bro and the younger bro is played by Won Bin. Who are two very popular actors in Korea and they fit the role very well and believable as brothers. Lee Eun-Ju is also in this and she was good as the fiancÃ© to Jang Dong-Gun's character and was good at showing her sorrows and desperation. It's a shame how a pretty actress like her decided to commit suicide. Overall if your in the mood for a war movie that is well crafted, this is one I can recommend.9/10",9,2,2,22 December 2012
Finding Dory," Didn't seem like a necessary sequel but it doesn't take anything away either.
","It's not as good as the first one, but it's a nice follow up. This isn't one of Pixar's film that will become a classic. But it's a movie that kids will have a lot of fun with and is watchable for adults. It isn't a Pixar movie with a lot of depth, deep meaning and messages when it comes to the story. But it's a simple and yet creative movie about Dory who has short-term memory trying to find her parents. With the help of her friends and acquaintances. Sure it can get tedious at times and it isn't a movie I would watch over and over again. But what makes this simple movie work is it's creativity and the situations the fishes and other sea animals gets into. And creative ways they go about it when trying to get out of danger and finding their way to certain locations. This isn't a sequel that I felt was necessary but it doesn't take anything away either.6.5/10",6,8,18,15 January 2017
Arrival," Existential sci-fi film about humanity and time
","This is one of those films that I have a lot of appreciation for but probably wouldn't watch again. It's a artistic, existential and symbolic film that doesn't try to go in a pretentious direction. Instead most of the cryptic messages and symbols can be understood after some deep thinking. This isn't a sci-fi action movie or a sci-fi film with a lot of tension and thrills. Instead it's a very quite and slow paced sci-fi film that focuses in on humanity, universal language and the concept of time. So yeah I have respect for the director Denis Villeneuve to make a symbolic and artistic film that doesn't get pretentious or overly ambiguous. Overall, this is a impactful film that will keep the audiences thinking about existence, time and the importance of love and relationships because it's fleeting.8/10",8,1,9,21 January 2017
The Terminal," I can't believe I missed out on the film when it came out
","Yeah, it might be unrealistic and cheesy at times but it's still a great movie and pleasant to watch. It's heartwarming and has humanity to it along with cute comedic moments. Tom Hanks Russian accent seems forced in the beginning but I quickly got use to it and seemed natural afterwards. Tom plays a very naive and yet kind hearted guy name Viktor Navorski who can't leave the airport terminal because of certain circumstances. And Stanli Tucci put on a believable performance and fit the mood of this movie well. He plays a Frank Dixon who is the head of security at the airport this movie takes place. And is the one that gives Navorski the most difficult time but without him there wouldn't be this story. The comedic moments in this movie really works and is a film the whole family can enjoy. The different scenarios come together in a delightful manner and that is what this film is, it's delightful and entertaining. So parts just seem way too far-fetched and underdeveloped. But that is passable because this isn't suppose to be a really realistic film. In fact it sorted reminded me of 'Forrest Gump' except it takes place in a terminal. Overall this is a movie that adults and kids can enjoy.8.5/10",8,16,17,14 January 2013
The Blind Side," Sort of beat my expectations
","I wasn't expecting much from this film, basically cause I ain't really into this types of genre nor am I into sport or care for it. So I wasn't excited to go see it when I saw the trailers, but too my surprise it kept my attention most of the way through and was a lot better than I thought it would be. The plot is basically about this big black guy named Micheal Oher who had no future in life, getting a second chance when he get adopted into a rich white family. And he is like a big harmless teddy bear and he takes advantage of his size to get accepted into good schools and making a career out of playing football. This was a touching film that is most definitely worth checking out and a good family film although it's actually quite profitable.7.5/10",7,0,0,14 February 2010
The Cannonball Run," Stupid absurd cross country race that is fun
","Now this is far from being a great movie but I can sort of see how this movie would have been entertaining to watch in the early 80's. If you played the video game Need For Speed: The Run than the premise is sort of similar, basically it's a race to get from one area to another while others are chasing after them. It's basically a cross country race where they have to cover great distance while driving. Yeah nothing special in the story department but the way it mixes comedy with it, is what makes it stand out. Instead of going in a very serious direction like movies of this genre do today, while being absurd. This one doesn't take itself seriously. But if your looking for a movie with great or even good plot you won't find it here. But what it does offer is car chase/race entertainment. Jackie Chan also make a cameo appearance as Jackie Chan as number 1 car racer. The editing is all over the place though and although it's a very very simple story. Since it's all over the place, it gives off the illusion of being a complicated story. Even though it tries to introduce and give a little about each racer. So basically it's a bunch of degenerates gathered for a race, which is fine because if the characters were normal this movie would have been really dull. When the wackiness ensues during the race it gets fun but not too so fun to the point I can turn away from the fact that this is a poorly written, acted and edited movie, even for a comedy. The whole thing just seemed so sloppy, despite the over the top mayhem and how the teams try to screw over the other teams and out drive or stay away from cop radar during the race to win. Also the young Farrah Fawcett is prettier than ever in this and Roger Moore is funny as his self-parody of James Bond. You know those serious and yet funny characters? Well he is that in this.6/10",6,0,0,18 March 2012
Rango," The CGI animation is solid and truly fantastic, everything else was just okay
","After seeing the first trailer of this cgi animated movie, I didn't really have a big hype for it nor did I know what the movie is about. After watching it, I can safely say it really did not meet my expectations. Now I know what style and direction it was trying to go but overall it just wasn't all that effective. The movie also seems to be all over the place sometimes and not in a good way either. There just wasn't the development to care what goes on all that much, I just didn't care for any of the characters in this movie and what happens to them. And like I said I didn't know much about this movie and didn't expect it to be a wacky CGI animated western or a semi-western movie for kids and adults. I will say the movie did have it's moments although I never heard the word 'water' so many times in a movie before. And the CGI animation is spectacular and amazing to watch, the quality of the CGI animation really is top notch in this. The voice actors did a really good job as well, didn't expect much from Johnny Depp in this but he pulled it off really well. Bill Nighy did a good job as Rattlesnake Jake the antagonist as well and really stood out. Overall the animation is solid and very detailed, it was truly amazing to see the CGI animation on the big screen but as for the direction and story. I could tell what what it was trying to do but wasn't fully effective. Maybe if the movie was a bit more witty at least I would have given it a higher rating.7.5/10",7,1,6,5 March 2011
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Very original!
","By the title, most audiences would think this is a comedic cheesy superhero movie. However it's nothing like that, instead it's a existential, philosophical story on human consciousness and in this case revolves around a washed up actor that now works in Broadway theater. The focus on detail is just amazing and the dialogue is intriguing, I can't say entertaining but intriguing. I could see why this movie could be perceived as boring, especially for viewers that isn't into art house movies. However the cast did a amazing job of bringing out the realism of this film that and the direction when it comes to the cinematography and story. As a matter of fact when it comes to the cinematography I will just say I could tell that a lot of effort was put into it. Mainly because a lot of the scenes are done in one very long shots. It's one of the few movies that I have seen that has the appearance to be done in just one long take. Careful editing and meticulous planning was in play. Overall this film is very memorable and it's an experience that last. So yeah, I highly recommend this film.8.6/10",8,3,11,2 February 2015
Centurion," Well the action scenes were well shot
","This started out really well, than just became boring. The first 10 min of this movie actually had a interesting story or at least was a good build up. Than it just became a story of how the Ninth Legion trying to escape the wrath of vengeance from the picts. There weren't any epic battles either, there is a scene where it was suppose to be over 3000 Romans in the Ninth Legion fighting the picts, but that was the only highlight of this film. After that the surviving Romans on the run from the picts. There are some good scenes here and there about loyalty and honor, but most of it is composed of boring chase scenes. I liked Olga Kurylenko playing Etain who is a tracker, but even that didn't make any sense sometimes. So she can track them from miles away but can't find them when they are right near her? It's disappointing to see a film that starts out with potential later go to waste. On the positive I thought the action sequences were well shot and you can actually tell what the hell is actually going on.5.8/10",5,2,9,8 September 2010
The Big Short," A story that needed to be told
","This was a really interesting film based on a crazy story that needed to be told. I will start out by saying this is a film you need to turn your brain on and focus in on it to get what is going on. The film is about corruption, the collapse of the housing market and the people that was in on it. Some having more of a conscience to do the right thing or at least caring more than others. Because it deals with screwing over hardworking Americans by giving them false hope. Now I am not a numbers guy, don't really have much passion for economics and banking. So I was confused about few of the technical terms they share, but this film had my interest and attention all the way through because of how it's constructed and orchestrated. What interested me is how it plays upon human psychology. At that time betting against the housing market was thought of as ludicrous because most people thought the system was stable. However Michael Burry who is a fund manager finds a crack in the system and decides the capitalize upon it. And while this is going on people either think he is crazy or wants to be in on it as well. People got a sniff of this huge money making chance and it revolves around people that wants to be part of it. Despite them basically making money off of the suffering of others. How innocent people will lose their homes, their jobs, their retirement over this. Throughout this crazy story, a lot of integration of logic and equation gets put into action. It is a complex plot, but I thought they did a good job of using certain analogies to help the mainstream audiences get what was going on. More than the directing style, it's the plot which is based on a true story that intrigued me through out the whole ordeal. And because of the cast fit the roles so darn well, except Christian Bale as Michael Burry. I mean he is a good actor and he did a fine job, but he just didn't seem like Michael. So it's not that Christian Bale put on a bad performance, it's a bit of a miscast. However Bale will be a part of marketing this film. To viewers that didn't really know in depth what happened in this huge financial crisis will be in shock. 8.3/10",8,2,4,1 January 2016
The Conjuring," Entertaining summer flick for the summer
","In this case, this is one of those movies that uses some horror clichÃ©s and few formulaic ideas that has been done before. But integrates them so well, it becomes a horror movie that actually stands out and worth seeing in theater. Sure a lot of the ideas in this movie has been done before but sometimes what matters is how it's all integrated into the movie. Which is done great for this one. It's takes the perspective of the family that is being haunted with a couple that is a clairvoyant and demonologist that goes around investigating paranormal activities. There is quite a bit of tension in this movie and the audiences seemed to be scared while enjoying the experience. Now this movie is based on true event but like all movies of this sort, it does go in a over exaggerated and far-fetched direction. But didn't come off overly cheesy and lame. Despite few different style of horror movies and creepy elements that gets mixed into this movie, it just didn't seem forced or a convoluted mess. In fact it all fits into the story. But yeah some of the clichÃ©'s can get tiresome or numb to. Like dog and child only ones being able to see ghosts, moving pictures, no matter how scary or creepy it gets they always decide to get their magnifying glass and go to the dark messed up areas to investigate and etc. The scares builds very slowly but it worth it for the most part. I saw few guys kinda tensing up and even squirming in there chairs while watching this movie. And when a girl behind me accidentally kicked her popcorn bucket during a tense scene. Just about all the audiences freaked out. This is actually a entertaining horror flick of this summer.7.5/10",7,2,4,19 July 2013
Scream," Original classic horror/slasher flick from the 90's
","This is a pretty thrilling slasher movie, that was a big hit in the 90's. And for the most part I can understand why, the movie isn't like other slasher at that time. And adds a lot of quick exchange of dialogue and the direction was more entertaining than watching just one person die after another. Well it does happen, but it adds elements that make it more entertaining to watch. Which makes Ghostface, one of the new slasher icon of the 90's. Yeah the characters in this movie is pretty stupid for the most part and the character actions don't make much sense sometimes. So basically this movie has slasher movie elements, but the movie makes references to those slasher movies and adds other sharp elements sometimes. And even if the movies comes off as a bit silly at times, it still has some tension and other aspects that manages to make this film from being another generic slasher flick. It will even make some audiences make them shout or think 'the killer is right behind you!' and such. Another aspect I liked is how most of the characters didn't just seem like cardboard just waiting to get killed, they actually stood out for the most part. Overall this movie was pretty original for it's time for a slasher flick and doesn't rely on huge amount of blood and gore for scares or to get the audience to be entertained. One of the main flaw that stood out was how it bashes on other past horror flicks and insulting characters from those movies, but the movie itself has similar flaws. Despite that it's still a pretty darn good popcorn flick with friends or even with a date.8/10",8,0,0,16 April 2011
Never Back Down," A lot better than I thought it would be
","This was actually a pretty entertaining film, with a okay plot and some good fight scenes. I actually enjoyed this movie and when the credits started it was time well spent. I mean it's no Oscar worthy movie and it doesn't have a great story, which is why some reviewers might bash on this film. But I am just going to judge this movie on enjoyment, and it's entertaining for a movie about a bunch of teens fighting. The protagonist played by Sean Faris, is a guy that tries to learn martial arts for the love of the sport after getting a taste of it, instead of self defence although he does get bullied by the character played by that one guy from that one teen show. Amber Heard is also in this and she is fine as always, although not much of an actress. Sure a lot of it is immature, but it's still fun. And the goal is to show how no matter how difficult an obstacle is in your way, be persistent and never back down while being entertaining at the same time. This was a lot better than I thought it would be, although it will get bashed on by a lot of critics that don't enjoy a entertaining movie and judges it by other factors or just jump the bandwagon of other reviewers.7.4/10",7,0,1,10 September 2010
Prometheus," Seems more like a sequel to 'Mission to Mars'
","This movie just seemed more like a hands on approach to 'Mission to Mars' than a prequel to 'Alien'. In fact it has almost nothing to do with the Alien movies. It wasn't a boring movie but for all the hype it got, it's sort of disappointing. This movie just lacked the tension and intensity that I was expecting. It just wasn't horrifying or anything like that, despite some of the mystery surrounding the planet the characters are in. This movie is more about the ultimate question when it comes to mankind and their conviction than anything else. But has more of the sci-fi elements thrown in. The CGI and everything from the surrounding looks realistic and cool to look at. Even the technology doesn't seem far-fetched at all and very believable, despite one technology that allows you to view other people's dreams. This movie keeps going with the build up without much payoff at the end. Some of the characters in this movie has conviction and wants answers and most audiences as well. Even if it is make belief by the makers of this movie it would be more satisfying to know what the makers of this movie's vision is. Maybe they just didn't have one or saving it for the sequel if there is one, but it was still disappointing. Also these character are probably suppose to be very intelligent people, since trillions of dollars went into the mission they are on. But they make the most stupid mistakes that even average people know better not to do. The casts for this movie is right on target and fit their roles really well. Michael Fassbender and Charlize Theron comes to mind but it feels like there could have been more done with those characters. Guy Pearce is alright despite him being in this movie for just a short while and him being almost unrecognizable. Anyways it's worth a watch to see the realistic looking world that Ridley Scott has created but almost everything else seemed a bit weak. Even when planning for a sequel a good ending is when the audience is left satisfied and yet wanting more. That just isn't the case for this and it gives the audience almost nothing. Also the plot holes for this movie is just way too obvious and really stands out.6.5/10",6,5,7,29 June 2012
Despicable Me," Cute, charming and touching without being too cheesy
","This is a CGI movie for kids and adults, where the plot is mainly from a villain's point of view. Gru(Gru) who is the bad guy or as bad as these CGI movies for kids and adults go. The rivalry between the villains is done well and the jokes are clean and yet fun. All the little things that happen in the background is fun to watch as well and just about everything is played out very well. I also enjoyed the mischievous music that is constantly played in this movie. It's also cute, charming and touching at times without being too cheesy, the minions was also one of the best part about this movie.7.6/10",7,5,8,31 January 2011
Back to the Future Part II," The 'heaviest' in the trilogy
","Now the first 'Back to the Future' has a simple premise for a time travel movie but had a LOT of clever moments that really drove the film. This time there is more time traveling going on back and forth in order to fix the future when the main villain gets a hold of the time machine. This does have clever moments, especially how it connects with the first movie during certain scenarios which is the main highlight of this flick. However it seems to count on mostly the first 'Back to the Future' scenarios and the different things that Marty has to do while the story in the first movie is taking place. And that is very cleverly incorporated into this movie, however it would have been better if it had other clever moments that stood out. And maybe it would have been cool to see Marty, his girlfriend and Einstein the dog working together in order to accomplish something would have been great if it was like I said cleverly incorporated into this sequel. But it just seemed like Marty's girlfriend was just there to pass out after seeing her future self. She does play a part in the third installment, but only so very slightly. When it comes to the plot this is the heaviest of the three and a lot more things are going on, however the simple aspects with although typical and yet well engraved gags, punches and larger than life direction made the first installment just more memorable. Don't get me wrong, this is still a really good sequel though. With a heavier sequel such as this especially dealing with time travel, it's difficult to not make any contradictions which this movie has some noticeable ones if you pay close attention to it. What I also found out is how Claudia Wells from the first one got replaced by Elisabeth Shue. I noticed something was different, but I just thought it was because of aging. Anyways although this is my least favorite of the three for me, it's still a compatible sequel to the trilogy. Just do not watch this without seeing the first one or it really does lose it's effect.8.2/10",8,2,4,28 May 2014
The Queen," It's about how you present yourself
","This film has to do with the queen of England after the death of Princess Diana, which also revolves around monarchy and how the death effects the royal family, not that they even cared that much but the families reputation. Helen Mirren did a fine job playing the queen, but no more than what we'd expect out of her. Michael Sheen was brilliant playing the role of Tony Blair, although his character is similar to a few of his other roles it worked really well in this one. The plot isn't something that gets the audience to care, maybe the Brits but I doubt they even care as well, unless your one of them that constantly shout 'God save the queen'. The queen didn't even stand out and was a bit childish than expected, and lacked a lot as a leader even if she is mostly a figure head, so you just don't care as much. Despite that it was a decent drama of a recent history.6.2/10",6,3,4,24 October 2009
Taken 2," It's watchable but nothing new
","The first 'Taken' was a cool quasi video game style movie with some good fight scenes. As ridiculous as it was, it didn't get to the point where it got ludicrous or very dumb. Sequels that fix the flaws of the first one is usually a good sequel. This one it adds to the flaws constantly to the point I couldn't help but laugh at how dumb this movie is. Yeah, sometimes movies go in a direction where you just have to just go with it. But because of the atmosphere of this flick it makes everything appalling. This review would get very long if I narrowed down every ridiculous scene in this movie. But one of them is when the bad guys lock Liam Neeson's character up and tie him to a bar. Now he is a guy that taken out plenty of the bad guy's men. But no one keeps a watch on him, this isn't 'Austin Powers'. Even 'Austin Powers' makes a joke about those kinda scenarios. Sure if the movie gave the protagonist few rooms to maneuver around in, it would have been possible. But the way this movie goes is like the bad guy's blindfold themselves and ask Liam Neeson's character to escape and kill them, like a death wish or something. Watching this was like seeing 'Grand Theft Auto' which doesn't work for a movie like this. I mean Liam's character and his daughter who is too old to still play that perky teenage girl. Goes around breaking every law in Istanbul. Some of the hand to hand fight sequences are cool to watch and it has it's moments especially near the end. But that isn't enough to make this movie any good. It's watchable and that is all.5.9/10",5,0,0,21 December 2012
Step Up," Well it ain't a terrible dance flick
","This is probably the first dance flick that revolves around romance. And it was pretty much sort of dull and boring throughout the whole movie, with a few good dancing in it. The plot is basically this, a hip hop street dancer gets in trouble and has to serve some community service hours at the school he trashed with his friends. If it had more hip hop dancing in it, it would have been a better moving. Not trying to bash on ballet, but it was just plain boring in this. The emotional and dramatic parts in this was just plain dull and lame. Overall it's a pretty boring dance flick, mainly cause it doesn't have enough cool dancing in it, and tries too hard to focus on the romance aspects of it, but it's not done really well and seems really weak. It's also a pretty narrow and predictable story, with nothing really interesting going on. It's passable film and has a few moments that is decent, where guys can tolerate it and girls will probably like it.5.1/10",5,1,2,14 October 2010
The Woman in Black," Finally a horror movie that isn't a found footage genre and it's scary
","Now I didn't read the novel this movie is based on but I sort of want to now after watching this movie. Now I seen scarier movies, mostly movies from Asian cinema. But this one did a pretty darn good job with the creepy eerie feel to it and the scares. The movie starts out pretty slow though and the build up is a bit boring with constant jump scares that doesn't build any tension. It almost seem more drama like than horror for quite some time but when the horror kicks in, it can get pretty scary. When the main character finds out what is going on, the tension starts to get pretty high and there is a lot of creepy parts to it as well. Which makes me wonder why they had those super creepy dolls for kids to play with but it does add a lot of creepiness from it. Although the camera seems to focus way too much on the dolls to the point the movie sort of feels like 'Dead Silence' sometimes. So the plot is this during the very early 1900's Arthur Kipps(Daniel Radcliffe) wife dies from giving birth to a male child and after a few years later after that event, he leaves his four year old son to handle a estate at a very very creepy mansion. I don't know about the character Arthur but it would take me a lot of will power to stay in a mansion like that by myself. Daniel Radcliffe is pretty decent in this and fit right in this movie and his small and skinny stature adds to his vulnerability which makes it more tense when the scary moments kicks in. But he just didn't seem that scared despite the really scary stuff going around, he sees something really creepy and he goes to investigate anyways which doesn't make much sense to most people. But this is one of those elements that apply to most horror flicks so it's passable. But his character still should have at least shown a bit more fear to make it buy-able, even if his character might have lost the will to live. Lot of horror flicks use children and something about their innocence and naivety adds the creepy effect and it's done with it's close to full potential in this. Sometimes this movie reminded me of 'The Grudge: Old Lady in White' and 'The girl in black'. Which is fine because those are pretty scary flicks as well. This is actually a decent movie after Radcliffe finished the Harry Potter franchise, this one will give chills and goosebumps. It did for me and I seen a lot of horror flicks, not the scariest movie I seen but this one does a pretty good job with the scares.7.5/10",7,0,1,30 March 2012
Shrek," Fairy tale spoof that is very fun and entertaining to watch for the whole family
","This is a simple fairy tale like story that is one of the best CGI animated movie for the whole family. It's just fun from beginning to end, even now it's known as a movie that set the mark for future CGI animated movies. I especially liked how it mixes a lot of fairy tale characters into one movie, without it being forced. It's a short and yet entertaining journey for the whole family that is most definitely worth seeing with the whole family. The modern feel of the movie with the olden times setting is done really well and the humor works with the great cast of characters. Not going to give anything more away, but I will just say even with repeated watches it's still good. I still think this movie is slightly overrated but it's still a pretty darn good movie.8/10",Null,0,2,17 August 2011
X-Men: First Class," As good as 'X2'
","When I first saw the trailer for this flick I didn't really have that good of an expectation, with 'X-Men: The Last Stand' and all. But this one blew my expectation and maybe it's because Bryan Singer had a part in the story for this cool flick. Because the story is just well written and doesn't and the pacing doesn't seem to slow down but goes straight to the point. With actions sequences that blend right into the story. James McAvoy plays Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbender plays Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto in this flick. And both those actors are freaking awesome with the roles they are given. In fact I couldn't think of any other actors to replace them. McAvoy plays the more young and like to drink, flirt and have fun while being responsible character just so darn well. Both actors are amazing in this but if I had to pick one that stood out slightly more it would have to be Michael Fassbender as Magneto. I don't know maybe I am a sucker for cool and charismatic villains. This time around Magneto it shows more of the development process of Magneto and a bit of his origin and it's just well blended into this story. He stands out way more than all the previous 'X-Men' movies combined. Sebastian Shaw who is the main villain that is trying to start WW3 by trying to start a war between America and Russia by using his team of mutants and Shaw is played by Kevin Bacon. Let's just say Kevin Bacon is right for this role. Although Shaw isn't a very developed character, Kevin Bacon actually makes this villain somewhat memorable. So yeah, well crafted superheroes story with well developed characters or at least memorable ones with the right actors. Makes this movie a must watch for audiences that enjoy superheroes movies.8.3/10",8,1,3,30 March 2013
Fifty Shades of Grey," Worse than 'Twilight'
","Wow, this movie is just terrible and when I say terrible it has got to be one of the worst romance movies I have seen. It's even worse than 'Twilight' which is actually saying something. Nothing about this movie makes any sense. Sure, when it comes to attraction, logic can go out the window. But nothing about this movie makes any sense. The chemistry just flat out suck and there wasn't a single remotely significant thing that stood out for any of the characters. Especially the female lead who was bland as bland can get. Naive maybe, but so uber bland. Maybe this is to attract most average female movie goers, but it's just so freaking bland. I know this was written by someone who is a fan of 'Twilight'. So the writing literally seems like someone below the age of 16 who is a fangirl that is into writing random scenarios of anime/manga/actors/singers would write upt. Except this movie goes in a serious direction and it falters in almost everyway possible. The start seemed like it would be something at least watchable, but it's far from it. After 15 minutes in, I was like 'when is this freaking movie going to end!'.1/10",1,2,4,22 May 2015
The Wolverine," Finally a 'Wolverine' film that fans wanted
","Unlike the previous movies that featured Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. The primary focus on this film is on The Wolverine. And I can assure anyone this film is much better than 'X-Men Origins: Wolverine' which was a disappointment. This time it has cool and emotionally driven action sequences, but also has a good story and substance to back it up as well. This time around it does a better job of bringing out the inner being of Wolverine and his character. How he is a complex guy with past scars and is a man with a tortured soul. This film really brings out the ferocity and viciousness when he is rubbed the wrong way and pushed into a corner. It wasn't the amazing story driven Wolverine with a lot of tense, enthralling, exhilarating and compelling that brings out the emotions. Maybe even somewhat close to the level of 'The Dark Knight'. But that is me probably expecting too much. This is still a absorbing film and I am glad it's more adult oriented this time around. It's entertaining all around and the action sequences is grafted into the story very well. It does have few great action sequences, but the primary focus of this film is on Wolverine as a character and his conscience. Now even Hugh Jackman's favorite story arc of Wolverine is the one that takes place in japan. And I am glad they went with this direction. I thought the makers did a great job of bringing that cool Asian vibe into this film. And I am not just talking about the weapons and ninjas either. One of my favorite action sequence is the one that takes place on a bullet train and I liked how they incorporated realism but also a bit over the top and yet cool direction with it. If that makes any sense. Although it slightly reminded me of the final train scene from 'Police Story 3', wouldn't be surprised if they were inspired by that film at the end. The cast is just right for this film, especially Hugh Jackman as Wolverine who I think is irreplaceable for the role of Wolverine. Unfortunately Hugh Jackman is getting old while his character is ageless or ages very very very slowly. Also this is the most bulk Wolverine has ever been in a film ever. Which shows Jackman's dedication and passion for his work and his character. This is my favorite Marvel film of this year and liked it more than 'Iron Man 3'. If you want to see a Wolverine film, a anti-hero film, or a well paced action film, maybe even cool Asian elements. This one just won't disappoint. The 3D actually adds to the experience.8.4/10",8,2,5,19 August 2013
Win Win," It's a okay indie flick but a bit dull and way too predictable
","This is a nice film with likable characters trying to do the right thing. The only problem is the characters starts to become really predictable really quickly. The plot is about a attorney Mike Flaherty(Paul Giamatti) that works double jobs, the other one is as a wrestling coach. But the is struggling with money issues and family. And when it comes to money issues, family usually go hand in hand. Mike Flaherty decides to take guardianship of a old guy named Leo that suffers from dementia and in return will get paid $1500 a month. But the extra baggage Mike didn't expect is Kyle(Alex Shaffer) who is Leo's grandson. And Kyle ends up spending a lot of time with Mike's family and gives Mike a motivation in life since he turns out to be a prodigy when it comes to wrestling. And Mike shows Kyle affection. So it's win win for both sides. The thing is the build up for this movie just seems so darn forced sometimes and doesn't come off natural. This movie slightly reminded me of 'The Blind Side' but just didn't move the heartstrings as much. Cause almost everything about this movie just seem drastic. I however like how it didn't try to sugarcoat everything, which would have took away the main positive element going for this flick. If this movie had a more natural and touching build up it would have left an impact and would have been a real indie gem. It just has a slow dull beginning and only gets slightly emotional and entertaining later on but everything is just so darn predictable in almost every way.5/10",5,4,6,3 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," Indeed a epic conclusion to a superhero legend
","Welcome to Gotham City, the most corrupt city on earth...And yet some still have hope for it. After the very successful 'The Dark Knight' movie just about everyone was highly anticipating a sequel. Wasn't sure the next movie would be the final conclusion but this is the end for Christopher Nolan's version of Batman. And what a epic movie this is, and it has some twist you probably won't see coming even if your a Batman fan. And the twists in this movie is actually cool and interesting. While 'The Dark Knight' is about Batman fighting crime at his peak this is about him being at his weakest and climbing back up. I also mentioned how Commissioner Gordon should work with Batman on cases more and in this they really work together. In fact Batman is going to need all the help he can get for this task. Now in my opinion I think Joker was a better villain but that isn't to say Bane didn't stand out. Cause he really did in this movie thanks to Tom Hardy's amazing acting chops. If you think Tom Hardy is intimidating and crazy in 'Bronson' this takes it to another level. Now Tom Hardy isn't a very big guy compared to actors like Vin Diesel or The Rock and other big tall and buff actors but he backs it up with acting chops. Which really overshadows his stature in this movie. He really does come off intimidating and menacing. The Joker and Bane have different style of doing things and when it comes down to the demeanor they are really different in that area as well. While the Joker tried to destroy people psychologically and spiritually, Bane tries to destroy people physically and emotionally. And Bane isn't a dumb brute in this but intelligent and plans ahead very well. Which makes him a very difficult opponent for Batman because he has brains and brawn. The Joker loves explosion he is going to love the Bane cause he blows up everything. The guy really wants to destroy Gotham and starts doing what he does best by intimidation and force. Bane's origin might not be exact as the comic books but it's well crafted into Nolan's version of the story. And doesn't seem to go way too far off. This is Christian Bale's final role as Batman before he hangs up the suit and he did a good final job as well. Lastly I will mention Joseph Gordon-Levitt as John Blake, I thought he was going to be just a small side character but plays a prominent role in this movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt just keep getting better and better with his roles and he was believable and likable as John Blake. This movie is over 2 hours and 30 minutes long but every minute of this movie is important for the story to be completed in a coherent manner for the most part. The tension and thrill really does build bit by bit, it might start out slightly slow but 'the storm is coming'. I couldn't help myself but be more immersed in the movie as it progressed, especially near the end. Sure there might be slight plot holes but for a movie that is on a large scale as this, it's passable. This movie is epic as a superhero movie can get. This movie isn't just well worth seeing, it's worth seeing at IMAX. The cinematography is top notch in this movie but it's better on the IMAX screen and it makes you feel like your actually part of the movie and will get the audiences immersed into this epic movie even more with the visuals. I seen this movie in regular theater as well and I can assure anyone that the IMAX is well worth the extra bucks and will leave more of an impact. This movie was simply made for IMAX. I give this movie a 9.3/10, like 'The Dark Knight' a bit more. One of the reason is because this movie revolves a lot more on Bruce Wayne than Batman which is alright but there doesn't seem to have as much Batman as the previous 2 movies. Also it seemed Nolan tried to do too much and compacted way too much into a movie that is just over 2 hours and 30 min. Yeah that is a long running time but it still felt it compacted too much although it has a lot of good and powerful scenes. But when it comes down to it this one comes in second in the trilogy for me.9.3/10",9,3,9,20 July 2012
The Croods," ClichÃ© and predictable, but good animation and wackiness
","There just isn't much that stands out about this movie. Some puns doesn't seem to make much sense when it comes to the scenarios and characters. Despite the setting taking place in a pre-historic time period, there isn't really anything new. There is a lot of obnoxious wackiness, which is understandable since it's dealing with cavemen. What I did like is how it sticks to the cavemen nature of the characters, while also blending in modern interaction. And I am not just talking about how the characters speak English. It shows the vicious and animal like nature of the characters back then, while also keeping it family friendly. All the voice actors and actresses is alright, again nothing that stands out but for the most part it seems to fit the characters. Nicholas Cage basically 100% sounds like Nicholas Cage. I give credit for the parts near the end, how it connects certain things together. While also bringing out the emotions, although the emotional elements maybe a bit clichÃ©. Overall this is a zany movie that the family can enjoy, despite the predictable direction and all.5/10",5,1,1,24 October 2013
Iron Man," I know it's a build up of how Tony Stark became Iron Man, but it would have been much better if it had more Iron Man in it.
","This isn't a awesome spectacular superhero movie, but it's still well crafted and entertaining. Iron Man is a Marvel superhero that stood out to me and in this, it gave me more interest in Iron Man and even Tony Stark the man behind the suit. Robert Downey Jr. really carried the movie in this as Tony Stark, the way he acted felt close to the comic book. Not exactly like the modern comics that has Iron Man in it but close enough. This is a origin of how Iron Man came to be and the build up of it all is nicely done. The build up is a long process but I wasn't necessarily bored by just watching how Tony Stark becomes the Iron Man. Jeff Bridges did a great job playing Obadiah Stane, he didn't have a lot to work with here. But when he was on the scene his presence was ominous and fit right in while also being intriguing to watch. I watched the movie 'Enron: The Smartest Guys In The Room' and he reminded me of the greedy and power hungry higher ups in a company. It's a shame his character wasn't developed all that well, but again this movie is about Tony Stark. Gwyneth Paltrow also did a good job of playing Pepper Potts, she did the perky and cute assistant thing well. The main flaw about this movie is that it just doesn't have enough Iron Man in it. I know the build up had to be a long process to show how it all happened in a short amount of time as possible but it would have been nice if it had like 2 or at least 1 more scene with Iron Man in action. Overall though this is a well crafted superhero movie that is a good blend of realistic and sci-fi that fits right into a comic book universe. It's a shame the next sequel won't be as good. But looking forward to 'The Avengers' movie which is hinted at the end of the credits. This movie ended in a very good note as well and will leave the audiences excited.7.9/10",7,1,3,3 December 2011
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It's for comic book fans
","Now this is a highly anticipated movie that got put down by a lot of critics. I personally thought it was a engaging movie that I appreciated the more I watched it. Now before giving a full review I was waiting for the Ultimate Edition of this movie to come out. Mainly because I wanted to give credit for this film in the fullest form. Since in the theatrical release, about 30 minutes was missing. Which made this movie look choppy in certain parts and lackluster because of the editing. And because bits and pieces that appeared to be missing that could have further explained things. Besides it showing Ben Affleck's butt cheeks, the Ultimate Edition shows more of Lois and Clark's journalism and investigative skills. With both of them trying to dig into what is really going on. With Lois trying to prove Superman's innocence and Clark trying to delve deeper into gaining information about Batman vigilante and what he does to some criminals. Which further explains why Superman was trying to stop Batman from what he does. Instead of it just seeming like it's just forced in there just to entertain and give the fans what they want to see. I however really liked the artistic imagery in this despite it having Zack Snyder's slow motion bits, but it didn't take away from this movie but was mostly used during the dramatic scenes. Mainly the dropping of bullets on the ground. The opening really got me pumped for what this movie was going to offer and for a movie that is around 2 and a half hours long, it flew by very quickly. I was also one of the guys that had doubts about Ben Affleck playing Batman, but the guy nailed it. Mainly because of his looks and built stature, it looked like he just walked straight out of the comic books. And the Batman fight scenes looked like it came straight out of the Arkham games. It was brutal and super entertaining to watch, it was simply badass. Christopher Nolan's Batman films did have phenomenal stories but it was the weakest when it came to Batman's hand to hand fighting. Especially in 'Batman Begins' the action scenes is distracting and not well done at all. In this however the fight choreography is topnotch and Batman fights like I envisioned he would. Plus Jeremy Irons is awesome here as Alfred, he appeared to me more as a caretaker and a friend than just a loyal butler. Plus he doesn't take crap from Bruce Wayne and speaks his mind. I was so pumped for this film, mainly because it has two of the most iconic superheroes in one movie and they are going to fight each other. How can anyone not be pumped for that? Maybe, unless you don't like superhero movies at all. Anyways the extra 30 minutes does add to the story and makes things make more sense. However it does make it in a way where it takes quite awhile to get to the action scenes. I am pretty sure that is one of the reasons why 30 minutes of it was cut in the theatrical release. And because although it adds to explaining certain things and why certain characters act the way they did. It isn't all that engaging or entertaining to sit through. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and I wouldn't mind watching it again and again. This movie is basically a set up for the upcoming Justice League films and so they compacted certain elements for the set up. Which I thought didn't really take away from the whole experience. However if you are not a comic book fan and didn't read much of DC comics, you will be one of the audiences that will be sort of confused with certain characters and set ups. The superheroes really needed there own individual movies to add more value to the characters and to what was going on, besides 'Man of Steel'. Gosh, Lois Lane has to be the ultimate damsel in distress, she gets saved like 3 times by Superman. Lastly when it comes to Lex Luthor it is a mixed bag when it comes down to it. I personally was fine with it, Jesse Eisenberg acted in a very odd and uncomfortable kind of way. You know the type of person you would stay away from at work, except that he is a Billionaire with a lot of power at his disposal. His version of Lex worked, because most Billionaire tycoons that has a silver tongue is more interested in making money over delving into the whole Superman ordeal. Yeah, he did remind me more of the Riddler, but his very odd and uncomfortable facade for the most part worked in this movie. Because it made his drive and insanity more believable. So yeah, this is a engaging superheroes movie with some cool imagery that is worth checking out for sure.8.8/10",8,2,5,10 July 2016
Blade Runner," A sci-fi noir cyberpunk materpiece
","To sum up this film, it's a classic sci-fi masterpiece that delves deep into existential and philosophical elements. How human's will try to create slaves or beings that will do work that they don't want to do or will not do. How everyone is looking for comfort and how some people will seek pleasure and comfort even if others are affected negatively by it. How people will give up integrity and stop with the search of wisdom for wits and how to take advantage of others for their own benefits. This film might come off pretentious to some audiences with it's visuals and style of it. But I thought the visuals and style of it actually compliments the intellectual aspects of this film. Even if it lacks in dialogue, the visuals really does bring about the grim and dark reality of the future. This isn't a film that I would watch over and over again. But for it's rare watch for me, it's stunning and psychotic when it comes to the characters and the dystopian setting. Harrison Ford was the it adventure and sci-fi adventure guy in the 70's and 80's. And he was almost the perfect choice to play an ex-police officer Rick Deckard. His job as a 'Blade Runner' is to track down and hunt for replicants, basically human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth. They have a very short life span and is thought of as disposable and expendable by the humans. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is a intimidating, manipulative and violent character that I have a lot of sympathy for. He is a character that is portrayed as a villain because of the setting and situation. And yet Roy Batty is a character that just about anyone can have understanding and empathy towards. Ridley Scott tried to emulate certain aspects of 'Blade Runner' into his few other films such as 'Prometheus'. Other artists, directors and even video gamer designers took elements from this movie. Hideo Kojima being one of them when it came to his work in 'Snatcher' was inspired and influenced by this film. Overall this is a sci-fi noir cyberpunk masterpiece that is most definitely worth the watch.10/10",10,0,4,16 January 2017
Monsters University," Better than the sequel or the story that takes place after
","Despite few criticism this film got when it comes to kid audiences. It's actually a fun and emotional movie about friendship and teamwork. The CGI is fluid and top of the line. When it comes to kid's comedy, it works for the most part. And even clever to a degree. As a matter of fact with everything combined for this prequel, I enjoyed it and had a better time with it than 'Monsters, Inc.' although both films are great. This one starts out a bit slow, but when it does kicks off, it's smooth sailing from there. It's like watching a cool Pixar flick about teen college movies and 'Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire' but focuses in on the monsters side of things. Overall this one a more entertaining Pixar movie than I expected. Thanks to clever execution and fun comradery.8.4/10",8,0,0,29 October 2013
Casino Royale," Daniel Craig is James Bond...
","The 007 gets a new bond after Pierce Brosnan. Now Pierce Brosnan was a good James Bond but didn't expect Daniel Craig to be better as James Bond. He just has that ferocity and rawness to him to the point you can actually believe he is going to do whatever it takes to get the job done. But also while being classy and having that charisma that James Bond is known for and Daniel Craig really pulled this very iconic role. So this is kinda the origin story of Bond and the story is tense and entertaining. When I first saw this film in theater I was entertained from start to finish. It's just a really cool movie with a really cool spy you just can't help but like because of his coolness. It also has some good exchange of dialogues to go with the intriguing story while also having good amounts of action. So Martin Campbell nailed all three areas. The sly and yet classy spy elements is blended in really well to the story, so yes it does have it's essence of 007 movies. In fact this is probably the most memorable Bond film so far and I am saying this in the year 2012. All of the cast worked really well into this movie and Eva Green is extravagant as the Bond girl while being really relevant to the story. While the previous Bond movies were a bit over the top and silly this one goes in a more modern and realistic approach. Overall if you like 007 movies I highly recommend you to check it out and for those that aren't there is a chance your going to like this one. The reinvention might be too much for some but in my opinion it did a good job of reaching out to the modern audiences.9.8/10",9,1,4,20 November 2012
Trainspotting," Drugs, sex and friendship from the perspective of an addict
","This movie tells a story through the perspective of a drug addict and all the crazy experiences he has and goes through. The disturbing and disgusting and yet realistic aspects of what comes with wanting that bit of pleasure is humorous and yet intriguing at times. In fact the repulsive bits aren't just there as shock factor but it plays a important part in the story. This movie also does not glorify the use of drugs like heroine but shows the negative aspects of it's use, including other drugs. The dialogue is another great part about this movie, let's just say it's amusing. This movie even has a slightly 'Fight Club' feel to it and although I was gonna give this somewhere around a high 7 I enjoyed and intrigued by this enough to give it a 8 by the end of it all.8/10",Null,0,0,30 August 2011
Before Sunrise," The start of a great romance trilogy
","This is a start of a realistic connecting romance movie from a trilogy. Now I saw 'Before Sunset' before seeing this one. But wished I have saw this first, since it's the first movie in this 'Before' trilogy. The story is about two people meeting and as they converse, they start to build a bond with each other. While also sightseeing and experience their time in Vienna for a evening. Again the conversations hit the mark, although this time it goes in a basic root direction. It's still interesting and intriguing, even if your one of those audiences that actually thought about some of the topics in the conversation. I am not quite sure how much is ad-lib or improvised but the direction is believable and realistic. Maybe it's because both the actor and actress put few of their own real life in put, such as how Ethan Hawke is really born and raised in Texas. The conversations is basically pseudo-intellectual and philosophical view points and questions. The chemistry and connection between the two lead characters is strong. This time Ethan Hawke's character Jesse is the pessimist and slightly not as likable. While the lead actress is a optimist and likable for this first installment. The dialogues or conversations touches upon life, death, religions, relationships, and love. So although it touches on the basics, it's still a immersive film. And I enjoyed it, maybe for it's realism and thought provoking effects. Even if some areas I could agree with while others not so much.7.8/10",7,0,0,29 August 2013
The Deer Hunter," Russian roulette has never been this tense
","This is a good movie, but it's one of those films that would have been better if it was a bit tightly edited and directed. Seriously the movie has Robert De Niro, Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep in it. Who would go on to leave a mark in cinema. So for this movie to fail was almost impossible. It's just a lot of parts of this movie seemed to drag a bit at times. Especially act 1 which is the build up, the build up just seemed way too long. The build up is done well and it stood out but felt a bit too drawn out. The movie could have easily cut about 30 minutes or maybe more or else maybe I am missing something. The key scenes of this movie is the Russian roulette. It has tension and humanity to it and is very memorable and sticks. In fact that scene has inspired a part in the video game 'COD: Black Ops'. I am not really sure if I can call this movie a masterpiece like some other critics, but what I can say is that it's a character driven movie that has humanity in it. The combing of two genres while also including symbolism was done just right as well. Like I said I am not sure if this is a cinematic masterpiece, but it's a film that all movie buff should at least watch once.7.9/10",Null,0,1,28 September 2011
Saving Mr. Banks," A charming film with heart
","This is a movie that really pulls on the heartstrings of the viewers. It's a film that can really impact the emotions of the viewers. It can be a very engaging and emotional experience if you are someone that has empathy and heart. This film does have Walt Disney in it played by Tom Hanks who did a phenomenal job bringing out the charisma and magnetic presence of Walt Disney. Now this might not be the most truthful representation of Walt Disney but for a movie such as this, it really does work. Every scene Tom Hanks was in just brought me to get a bit more attached to his character and have more respect for the guy. However the main protagonist of this movie is Pamela 'P. L.' Travers who is played by Emma Thompson, who also did a really good job playing this really jaded, cynical and stubborn character. Sometimes, actually most of the time, the environment builds people into who they become. And Pamela 'P. L.' Travers had a sad and poor childhood with a highly imaginative father who she looked up to. Anyways Pamela 'P. L.' Travers is well known for her Mary Poppins series. It's like the golden egg to her, maybe because it has bits and pieces of her in the story. And the imaginative and yet business driven guy like Walt Disney wants the rights to her story and make a live action movie out of it. Disney tries to be accommodating as much as possible but Travers wanted everything her way down to every last detail. And thus a slight bit of conflict starts with Walt Disney employees and Travers. During this process it delves into the childhood of Travers and her relationship with her father. This is a very tearjerking movie and it's actually quite heartfelt. Especially the scene near the end, when Disney tries to bring out his final card by showing empathy. It really does show how empathy can change the world. Great acting and heartfelt moments with a script that is based on a true story that works makes this a film that is most definitely worth a watch.9/10",9,1,2,1 July 2016
Fantastic Mr. Fox," Return of a great stop motion animation film
","It's the return of stop motion animation and I loved it, it's a shame this film's hard work didn't pay off at the box office though. Okay so the story is about a Fox family Mr.Fox(George Clooney), Mrs.Fox(Meryl Streep), and their son(Jason Schwartzman), Mr. Fox a retired thief for livestock who wants to return to his greatness of being a thief. And in order to do so, he plans to steal from the 3 farms that is occupied by 3 different but dangerous farmers. And soon the farmer go on a all out war with Mr. Fox and a war between them begins. The actors voice fit right in with the characters and didn't have any complaints about it, I also enjoyed the style of humor that was in this film. The stop motion also adds to the quirky personalities of each characters and the story is even well written and enjoyable. The movie simply shines.8.2/10",8,0,1,17 February 2010
Speed," Solid fun action movie from the 90's
","This is a dumb but exhilarating and entertaining movie. Although some parts of the movie doesn't make much sense. It's still one of the good action movies from the 90's. I can see where Hideo Kojima got some of his ideas from for his 'Metal Gear Solid' game and some of those ideas probably came from watching this movie. It's a cool movie with a cool and charismatic protagonist played by Keanu Reeves who plays Officer Jack Traven. Who will do everything he can to save innocent lives from the clutches of the bad guy. But yeah, the plot is basically about a old guy wanting 3.7 million dollars by taking people hostage. And he goes about it in a dumb manner for a guy that is suppose to be intelligent. And that villain is played by Dennis Hopper who is actually good as the villain in this movie but plays a character that basically asks the good guys to beat him. Anyways after his first scheme he decides to rig a bus with passengers with a bomb and the bus has to go over 50 miles an hour for it not to blow up with innocent lives. And it's up to Officer Jack Traven and the police force to stop the guy. Overall this is a good solid fun popcorn flick from the 90's. Even the beginning credit scene I usually want to skip through I enjoyed because of this movie's theme music, which is also cool and memorable. And sounds similar to one of the songs in 'Metal Gear Solid'.8/10",8,0,1,19 April 2013
Live Free or Die Hard," Pretty solid movie to the 'Die Hard' franchise
","This is actually a solid 'Die Hard' sequel to the franchise. It's probably the 3rd best in the series so far unless 'Die Hard 6' can change that. This time it's about virtual terrorism where the main villain actually comes off slightly reasonable in some way. Not saying what he does in this movie is right but it's understandable. This movie has some cool action set pieces that is coherent to the plot and doesn't seem all that forced in. Sure some parts may seem a bit too coincidental but that element applies in all the 'Die Hard' movie so far. It clearly show that the director actually put some effort into what the 'Die Hard' movies are about. John McClane(Bruce Willis) is at the peak of what he does best in this movie although he is getting old and lost all his hair. And he still is a smartass that knows how to tick off the bad guys. His sidekick this time, yeah this time it's more of a sidekick than a partner compared to 'Die Hard 3'. And his sidekick is played by Justin Long who is this computer wiz that knows a lot about technology and he is one of those pedantic characters. He starts off kinda annoying but becomes somewhat likable as the movie progresses. So it's basically a team up between a tough badass and a weak computer nerd that knows a lot about technology. And they need each other to take down the main villain played by Timothy Olyphant. Who is this technology mastermind, especially when it comes to state security. So it basically becomes a battle between a guy that uses fists and gun and the other using brain and few henchmen, but mainly his brain. Even the main villain's henchman or henchwoman stands out to a degree. One is played by Cyril Raffaelli who is this Parkour genius in real life and shows hist stunts in this movie. And Maggie Q who is this more badass main villain's chick version of the one from 'Die Hard 3'. Overall this is a cool action packed movie and a good enough sequel that is worth seeing. It's a shame that 'Tranformers' the movie directed by Michael Bay came out the same year and took all the spotlight. Oh and Mary Elizabeth Winstead is in this as John McClane's daughter who is basically a damsel in distress but a tough and feisty damsel in distress. Who is basically kind of a plot device to give John McClane more of a motivation and to bring his father like side out.7.4/10",7,1,4,22 February 2013
X2: X-Men United," The best one in this trilogy
","This sequel surpasses the first movie by a huge margin, it literally covers up all the flaws from the first movie. The first movie was good but this sequel is so much better. This has a well crafted story and has way more action sequences that the first movie lacked. In fact not only is there more action in this there is more creative use of powers and the fight sequences are so much more entertaining to watch. This is a superheroes movie done right in almost every way, it's not a perfect movie but it's hands down a great one. That fans of these types of genre should most definitely not miss out on. This time around the X-Men and the brotherhood of mutants team up to battle. Everything is done very well to the point that it seemed like the first movie was sort of like a build up for this movie.8.2/10",8,0,1,29 June 2011
The Ringer," Below average comedy/romance
","I found Johnny Knoxville to be cool, but not that funny. And was hoping for some good laugh, but that is not what I got out of it. Everything about this so called comedy wasn't funny and was just predictable. All the funny parts are in the trailer and the trailer wasn't even funny. This film had some good idea, but it turned into more of a romance movie than a crude outrageous humor movie that I was expecting it to be. It also follows the clichÃ© of the protagonist going with the flow and realize he made a mistake and tries to correct that mistake and show some morals near the end. And despite Johnny Knoxville being pretty good at acting retarded, this film had hardly to do with the special Olympic. The romance in it isn't even good and is a pretty bad date movie as well. So not a good comedy or a date movie, so just pass on this one. There is just way better comedies out there.3.8/10",3,0,1,11 September 2010
Thor: The Dark World," A sequel just for the sake of a sequel
","This is a very unpolished sequel that seems to have gotten made, because they wanted a sequel and more money for the studio (probably more about the money). I liked this less than the previous first installment and I am not even a fan of the first one. It has more action and special effects, but that doesn't make a superhero movie any better. It just wasn't interesting nor did it have anything for me to attach myself to. After few minutes in, I just wanted for the final action set pieces to come in (which is actually cleverly done) and be done with. I know humor isn't suppose to be the part that stands out in a superhero movie, but my goodness, the humor in this is just forced and awful. Some of the characters seem more annoying than beneficial to this movie as a whole and just seemed to be there, because they were in the previous movie in this franchise. This movie brings nothing new to the superhero genre, they had the mentality of 'if it works previously, why fix it?' direction. It's like one of those video games that does well with the first installment, but does the same thing with the gameplay and everything for the next installment with a different story with just another different villain that is generic as it gets.5.9/10",5,20,33,17 December 2013
Lucy," Wasted potential
","Don't be fulled by the trailers, this isn't really a action movie. As a matter of fact there is't anything memorable when it comes to the action for this flick. This is a shallow movie that revolves around evolution. I personally thought this movie sucked and just didn't make sense in some areas. The movie 'Limitless' was better in my opinion, which is another movie about a person being able to access 100% of brain capacity. This movie is rubbish and I was bored with this one. I give this movie a 2.6/10 because I liked the car chase scene. Which is probably the only cool part about this movie. Unfortunately this is another wasted potential that centers on just an idea.2.6/10",2,2,7,13 October 2014
AmÃ©lie," A colorful film about a secret admirer
","'Amelie' is like a colorful modern time fairy tale about a innocent and naive girl who has some very weird hobbies, falling in love with some other guy that has some weird hobbies himself. As a matter of fact just about every character in this film is pretty odd, like some cartoon characters although the film itself is very colorful. One day Amelie finds a box with some old guys childhood belonging in it and decides to return it to him and if he is grateful, she would help others as well. And during her journey of trying to help others, she falls for a guy who has hobbies of collecting other peoples photos in photo booths that has been tossed away. This is a colorful, bright, funny and delightful romantic film that kids can enjoy it as well despite 2 very short nude scenes that can be fast forward. It was a magical experience that leaves the audience feel lighter, even if Amelie may seem like a bit of a stalker but that is forgotten cause of the film's charm and since the lead actress doesn't appear to be a psycho. I also enjoyed the film's cinematography very much, more than the typical Hollywood style. It maybe a bit overrated but isn't bad as some claim it to be, I think the people that do bash on this film, bash it for being too positive.8/10",8,0,4,22 October 2009
Moonrise Kingdom," So Wes Anderson
","This one lacked the impact and momentum of Wes Anderson's previous films. But it's so Wes Anderson that the style of it really brings this film to fruition. And I really liked the style and the direction of this film, especially when it comes to the odd and yet quirky interactions and humor. Again the retro vibe is just splattered on screen from beginning to end. When it comes to the story it sort of reminded me of a Wes Anderson's version of Peter Pan. I like the emotional battles between ideals and realism with emotions mixed in. This is a simpler Wes Anderson film that is really worth the watch. Not his best work, but Stylistically it's superb.7.8/10",7,0,0,23 September 2015
The Sixth Sense," Paved the way for other horror movies to try and emulate
","This is the film that boosted M. Night Shyamalan career in the movie making business. When this movie came out it was a direct hit and brought something new to the horror genre. It was creepy, thrilling, suspenseful and yet still had that heartfelt elements. What I liked about this movie is how it didn't really on gore or jump scares to get the audiences attention. But because it brought that clever detailed build up that a lot of the horror movies now a days are missing out on. As a matter of fact this is a film that the whole family can watch without really offending anyone...Much. But it's still a really good film. The two main leads were the perfect match for this film. Bruce Willis's role as Dr. Malcolm Crowe was perfect. As a matter of fact I heard that Dr. Malcolm Crowe actually wrote the role for Bruce Willis. And Haley Joel Osment was amazing as an actor when he was little. Overall this is a great horror filmmaking and was a clever idea when it came out.8.6/10",8,0,1,18 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," The Force isn't that strong with this one
","There has been a lot of hype going into this film. And I will admit the fact that it carries on the 'Star Wars' name and because of the nostalgia factor, I will give this film a slight advantage when it comes to my grading scale. However I can't just jump on the bandwagon and claim this movie was awesome or anything like that. And I am a reviewer that tries my best not to be picky about the small stuff. It just did not meet the super hype it has been getting. As a matter of fact this installment was a bit disappointing. Nowhere near as disappointing as 'The Phantom Menace' and it's at least better than Episodes 1 through 3. However the original classic trilogy is still better than this one. The cast was good with a lot of new faces and few old. Harrison Ford takes on the role of Han Solo, but he is a bit of a different Han Solo. In this he is more of the wise father figure like guide, which actually works when it comes to the context of this film. But the actress Daisy Ridley as Rey. She just nailed as this character who is innocent but not really naÃ¯ve, feminine but able to handle herself and emotional at times but very competent. She is almost a bit too cool in this installment. It was kinda cool to see Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson in the same film, the last film they were in together was 'Ex Machina' which is a great film worth checking out. The most interesting character was in my opinion Kylo Ren, although his motives aren't entirely clear the emotional scars and the demented aspect of this character stood out to me. I also found it interesting how when he wears the mask that alters his voice, he comes off as this menacing and intimidating villain. But when it takes the mask off and shows his very human like face, he comes off as this whiny kid who is sort of emo. But he tries to emulate or maybe become just like Darth Vader. The chemistry between the characters was good, but I just felt there should have been more of a development. I guess they were saving that for the sequels. 'Star Wars: The Force Awakens' is a entertaining enough film, but it still felt empty and not very satisfying. If it was satisfying but made the audiences want more, it would be another thing but that just isn't the case with this one. It spends too much of it's time trying to build up for the sequels instead of it being a fine stand alone movie itself while leaving room for the sequels. There is a lot of things that are not explained in this one. Lastly it also lacked the emotional grip that it needed, because one of the most important scene in this film just wasn't really impactful because of how the whole thing was structured and how it got to that point. I guess I had a bit too high of a expectation from J. J. Abrams but this movie was pretty mediocre. Hopefully Episode 8 will be better since they went through the build up stage.7/10",7,21,38,25 December 2015
Cinderella," One of the most appealing fairy tale for girls.
","I think just every little girl or anyone that grew up listening to fair tales knows the story of Cinderella. It does give little girls the wrong perspective of marriage and all, but I can see why this movie can be enticing for a lot of girls and even women around the world. I actually like the secondary acts and characters of this movie. Even if Gus Gus can get annoying sometimes, but he atones for it at the end and sometimes that is what matters. Cinderella isn't a very standout character, nor do I think she is a strong heroine. And again it plays upon the Prince Charming saving her from all her struggles which includes her step mother and evil step-sisters. However when it comes to the overall package, it's actually a pretty good fairy tale movie from Disney. At least it's better than 'Snow White', even if some may disagree. Even the musics are more memorable.7.3/10",7,0,2,23 September 2014
RED," Forgetful wacky action movie
","This is one of those wacky action movies that is also very forgetful. Yeah it did have it's moments and was fun at times, but almost everything in this movie has been done before and nothing really stood out much. I first read the comic book which this movie is loosely based on and wondered how they were going to make a movie out of a super short comic book. The answer is add more characters, more wacky action and comedy while the comic book is dark and gritty and add more story involving the conspiracy and such. And some stuff that wasn't answered in the comic book or left unanswered on purpose is shown in the movie. There is also barely any character development in this and the girl that Bruce Willis's character falls for is more annoying than funny or fun character to watch. Some critics liked heard in this, I personally didn't. Yes, the movie is wacky at times and it also tries to be funny, but it really isn't at all. The character interactions was okay and kinda enjoyable at times though and the action isn't that good but it's alright. So it's a passable wacky action movie just not a really good one.6.1/10",6,2,5,21 January 2011
Flight," Predictable for the most part but still a good movie
","This is a predictable movie for the most part and if you seen the trailer it becomes even more predictable and yet it's a good movie. The plot is about a commercial pilot named Whip Whitaker(Denzel Washington) who uses his piloting skills when something goes wrong with the plane and crash lands the plane with 6 killed on board. But majority of the people surviving the crash to see another day. The only big problem for Whitaker though is that they did his blood test after the crash and found his alcohol level is just too high and they found 2 vodka bottles that can either belong to him or one other crew on the plane. And thus it becomes a movie about a man's downward struggle with alcohol and coke, while also dealing with moral issues. This flick sort of reminded me of the movie 'Courage Under Fire' which also has Denzel Washington in it and him dealing with inner struggles by constantly drinking. Denzel Washington again shows off his amazing acting chops and is the one that really carries this movie. He really makes his character's inner struggles believable. And although his character is a arrogant drunk and a drug addict I couldn't help but have sympathy towards his character. When it comes to movies about a man's life spiraling downwards this is one of the good ones.7.8/10",7,1,2,26 March 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," My favorite in this movie franchise, probably the best movie of summer 2011
","I was never really a fan of Harry Potter and especially the movies. But I gotta admit this final installment was just awesome. It wasn't as epic as I thought it would be but it's still epic. The plot also has some very emotional twist and turns that will make some viewers cry a little while watching. The girl next to me couldn't stop weeping. The special effects are top notch and the acting is the best in this franchise. I never thought I would be sad to see this franchise finally end. But during the final scene it was sad...Well just slightly that it's the end. One big gripe I have is how some of the main characters gets killed off way too easily and some even off screen. Anyways that is just a small complaint, overall this is a movie that is worth seeing it in theater. It's a great conclusion to this popular series.8.4/10",Null,0,0,2 August 2011
Unbroken," 'If you can take it, you can make it'
","This is a film that delves into the life of Louis 'Louie' Zamperini as American athlete and a hero. The first half of the movie is basically flashbacks of Zamperini's childhood and his will power to overcome and become a really good track runner. And how he gets involved in WW2 as a soldier and how his group tries to survive when their plane gets shot down. I personally think they could have done a better job of developing Zamperini, instead of just showing him mostly getting tortured all the way through. But I admired the guy's integrity for standing up for what is right even if he had to give up his comfort and safety to do so. I found that super admirable, especially since this film is based on a true story. And maybe because after watching 'The Circle' this film was a more inspiring watch. The second character that is sort of developed is a Japanese named Mutsuhiro Watanabe. Who is driven by his own ignorance and arrogance, the guy is a sociopath that has zero empathy. The guy has no honor or integrity and even at a very old age, he decided to die with his ignorance and stupidity intact. The guy is basically a disgrace to the human race and should be forgotten but only remembered for what people should stray away from becoming. I personally thought the film had a good message of pushing forward and not giving up the fight. But a bit more development and substance to the plot would have made this one really stand out for a POW film. I personally think Mrs. Jolie did a fine job with this film. It's watchable and to a certain extent it's inspiring.7/10",7,0,1,11 September 2016
Final Destination," Interesting and creative idea for a horror flick
","The premise to this movie is creative, it could have gone in a more balls to the wall direction which would have been more entertaining. But the execution to this movie is alright. The build up is a bit slow but the foreshadowing is well done and gets more intriguing as the plot progresses. Intentional or not the humor in this actually works as well. Overall it isn't a great horror flick but the original premise makes it unique and stand out. However it would have been better if it went into a more crazy approach or in a more non ridiculous approach, one of the other. Because it starts to get ridiculous near the end.7.3/10",Null,1,1,13 August 2011
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," The grand finale to the epic journey
","The three extended editions total up to be around 12 hours but it most definitely was a worthwhile journey. And although each movie has a very long running time it went by really quickly. Even if the movies in this trilogy seemed long, it was so engrossing and enthralling to the point you could hardly notice the long length of these movies. In fact it seemed to go by way faster than the movie actually is. This third movie in the movie is indeed a grand finale and is another epic film in the trilogy that really leaves a mark. It ties up the loose ends quite well and most definitely has the feel of a epic final installment. Some may complain that this movie has too many endings to it, which I thought the same at first. But for a long epic journey as this the ending is very important and I can see why Jackson wanted to tie up every loose ends without having a ambiguous ending. And when it comes down to it, the whole journey is mainly Frodo's story not Aragorn. But even I gotta admit I got up in theater like the rest of the audience since I really thought the movie was over because of the multiple endings. One of the audience actually stood up than sat back down shouting 'when is this going end' which got the audiences laughing. Anyways the movie overall was just amazing, even the battle sequences was just jaw dropping. It's about the same level as the battle for Helm's Deep but has a bit more cool and memorable sequences going for it. There is a lot of one liners in this movie especially by Sam but those one liners leave a impact and moves the emotions without being forced and it works here as well. I have said this before on my other reviews for this trilogy. But I will say it again, watching the extended edition is crucial for this movie and it explains a lot for the characters actions. It has lot of the key scenes that are missing from the theater release. But there are some random bits that even the extended edition couldn't cover up, the part about Eowyn and Faramir isn't developed very well and just comes off plain random while watching. I know Jackson wanted to focus on the core of the story but that just came off random and not developed enough like few other scenarios in the movie. Anyways although this third installment has a lot of action in it, there is a lot of story going on in the background as well. And has messages and intriguing plot even before the main action takes place, and the action let me tell you is very cleverly crafted. And it's just amazing to watch, just the battle sequences alone is worth the price of admission when it hit theaters. It's the last film in the trilogy and by now the audiences got use to the characters and although the development of the characters aren't entirely fleshed out to the point you actually care for the characters and the cause. Sort of like after playing a long RPG game and is satisfied and sort of sad when it ends, you get the same feeling with this movie. This trilogy is a epic masterpiece and the last installment has got to be the most uplifting one out of the three films, although I liked 'Fellowship' the most. This is a grand finale and the conclusion to a epic journey that should not be missed, although anyone who enjoyed the first film in this trilogy will most definitely watch the whole trilogy anyways. It's simply inevitable.9.1/10",Null,0,1,8 October 2011
The Purge," Ridiculous and dumb
","This is a very disappointing movie. Besides the messed up and yet unique premise. It just falters to expand on it, which it really needed to do. And just basically focuses in on a dis-likable rich white family. The boy kid is the only one with a conscience, but even him I found to be dis-likable. Just about everything about this movie is dumb and lacks common sense in every way possible. To the point, even for a slasher popcorn flick it get annoying. And there is hardly any tension, and things just zoom by way to quickly. Maybe it's because, everyone wields guns for the most part. Even the twist at the end is just kinda random and not believable. Besides the concept and idea, nothing else stands out. Mainly because the premise and idea, is just on the sides and didn't seem very important when it comes to the core of the plot. And thus becomes a narrow, dull and cheap slasher flick. The villains in this seems like something inspired from the Manson family and from the film 'The Strangers'. And the leader of the pack reminded me of a young John Malkovich. But they are just not all that intimidating. Maybe because they just lacked that mystery and because they are all mostly incompetent. I just couldn't buy any of the characters in this movie, they are all mostly over the top and crazy. Overall this is just a dull, dumb and cheap slasher flick. It's just amateurish and didn't seem like much effort went into this. It's just full of plot-holes and loopholes.3.3/10",3,3,5,26 August 2013
Munich," Has realism, tension and humanity...One of Spielberg's best
","Okay so the basic premise of this movie is about a group of Assassins that go around killing certain people for the Jewish people and their land. And the movie is very well crafted and kept my interest from beginning to end and even has good amount of tension and surprises. And it's mostly all believable, the movie is thrilling despite it goes from one assassination mission to another. The plot has a good blend of being simple and yet a bit convoluted but in a good way. The character driven aspects are well done and it's just great just watching the characters have conversations with each other because of the rich and thought provoking dialogues. I especially liked the final message at the end of the movie. Eric Bana did a great job being the leader of the team of assassins, in fact the whole cast was great and fit right into there roles. Spielberg really did a excellent job for the casting for this movie. Every character had a top notch presence on screen and most of them were fleshed out. I could type up a whole essay of why this movie is worth seeing, but I will just say it's one of the must watch films if you enjoy watching movies.8.3/10",8,2,3,6 January 2012
Pitch Perfect," Embarrassing movie to sit through if your a guy...
","This isn't a awful movie but it's not a good one either. Movies where a group of students that come together to beat another team in a competition has been done before. And there are so many clichÃ© parts in this...Just watch 'Drumline' it's a way better movie. There are bunch of characters in this movie but a lot of them is not developed enough at all. This time around a group of students are competing in a acapella tournament. I guess this movie is for girls that are into mainstream music cause a lot of them was cracking up and laughing throughout this movie. Despite it having very corny humor that is hardly ever clever. Most of it is toilet and sexual remarks humor that isn't clever or witty. The main girl in this is Becca played by Anna Kendrick who I am not a fan of although some critics and audiences seem to really like her. She basically reminds me of a female version of Adam Scott. And like a lot of movies of this sort she is like the only normal character in this entire movie and she is surrounded by weird or awkward characters. And it depends way too much on how weird and awkward the other characters are to get in some laughs. Sometimes it can be effective but not in this case although a lot of the female audiences which made up most of the audience members was actually laughing. Nothing about this movie felt like your watch real college students at all cause the mannerism and dialogue just seemed so fake, it almost seems like a Disney drama show with more toilet and sexual humor. Also everything about this movie is predictable from start to finish and it doesn't really try to do anything different. It isn't a uber awful movie but it's far from being a good movie. Skylar Astin as the male lead in this is a very likable character though.4/10",4,10,28,4 October 2012
The Truman Show," 'We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented'.
","I remember watching this movie as a kid and being really captivated by it. Watching it again now as an adult made me really appreciate films like this. The concept and idea of this film makes it really captivating. It's interesting how this film and 'Pleasantville' came out at the same time. While 'Pleasantville' is about going into the fairy-tale land and making a difference, this one is about a man trying to leave the fairy-tale land. It isn't as magical as it was when I saw it as an adult but I now appreciate it more for what it is after having some life experiences of my own. It's about not conforming to the same routine, about taking risks, to sometimes be able to leave the comfort zone in order travel abroad and have experiences that are beyond where you are at. How some people can try to restrain you from exploring and and take away chances you dreamed of and how it's your choice when it comes to what you really want to do with your life. Despite the really far-fetched and a ridiculous concept this film has, it accomplished what it tried to do. Jim Carrey was at his peak when it came to stardom and was the topnotch actor at the time. And he was the perfect choice for this role at the time as well. Overall this the style of films I miss now a days, I highly recommend this one.8.1/10",8,0,0,16 January 2016
The Hunger Games: Catching Fire," Still not into this movie franchise
","I didn't like the first one, it just reminded me of a crappy version of 'Battle Royale' with sci-fi and political stuff thrown in. This one isn't much better, well it's better than the first one but I just wanted it to end. The first half of this movie is about politics and how the tyrant government that is trying to ruin Katniss after she won the first tournament. Mainly because the government feels that she is becoming the symbolism of hope through defiance. I just wanted to get to the tournament, but it actually turns out the mediocre at best build up is better than the actual dull tournament that takes place in the second half. Even if everyone is on teams and they have their own skill sets and stuff. The development of the contenders are worst this time around as well. It does have a bit of emotion and slight elevation of interest near the very end. And I thought the message of how the rich become gluttonous, while the poor suffers and doesn't have much opportunities while the higher class become wasteful is done well in this sci-fi setting. Still not looking forward to the sequel though.5.5/10",5,5,11,6 May 2014
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," A bit weak...
","This movie could have been a really good one when it first came out, maybe even great. But lack of development and not enough clever ideas make this one a passable duo adventure flick. I can sort of see why this movie was a hit when it came out but watching it now, it's just has quite a bit of flaws. The plot is basically about Bill(Alex Winter) and Ted(Keanu Reeves) who are in a garage band. They are both basically airheads that likes to air guitar. And because of certain circumstances they get a phone booth time machine and travel around collecting historical figures so they can pass their history class. But the thing is there just isn't much historical elements in this film. And just show very slight glimpses of the past while kidnapping historical figures. Sure it slightly humorous watching how the historical figures cope with being in 1989. But there is nothing to know about the historical figures in this flick and nothing really to adventure about in each of the time period Bill and Ted visits. There isn't anything clever about the execution as well. Bill and Ted are a likable duo but this adventure just seemed weak despite the time travel thing going on. Also Keanu's role in this stayed stuck on him throughout his career...Fortunate or unfortunate that maybe.5.2/10",5,1,2,7 May 2013
The Matrix," A revolutionary movie
",When I saw this movie for the fist time when it came out. I thought it was the coolest and most badass movie ever made. I wasn't entirely sure what was going on when it came to the story at that time. But all I knew was that is was really cool. It's a bit outdated now but it still left a mark in cinema and inspired a lot of movie and more to come. The story is actually very creative and has sci-fi philosophical elements that is well blended into the story and isn't forced. And the dialogue is even cool and interesting. I am not going to get in depth with the story but I will just say that it's pretty clever without it being overly complex. This is probably Keanu Reeves's trademark movie and I can't picture anyone else taking the role of Neo besides him. And glad that someone like Will Smith didn't end up with this role. Nothing against Will Smith but Keanu Reeves is just the better candidate. He was just perfect for a movie like this and fit the image of a average cool hacker that gets picked or chosen to do something much much greater. Even the mentor character Morpheus(Laurence Fishburne) and the main villain Agent Smith played by Hugo Weaving are excellent choices for the roles they were given. The action was super cool and even amazing when this movie first came out. In fact it's the first movie I seen that blends slow motion and bullet time in a effective manner in a movie. It tries to combine so many stuff into this one film but it does it right. One of it is the anime film 'Ghost in the Shell' which obviously played a huge part in inspiring the Wachowski brothers. Overall this is a cool and entertaining movie with some wicked ideas that all sci-fi movie watchers shouldn't miss out on...Well it's been out for more than a decade. It's a shame the sequels will ruin this awesome mythology of 'The Matrix'. To the point I think this movie would have been even more legendary if the sequels didn't come out or if the sequels was at least good as 'Dark City'.9.8/10,9,2,5,19 December 2012
Looper," Probably my favorite sci-fi flick of 2012
","After watching this well crafted movie 'Men in Black 3' came to mind which deals with time travel as well.

Maybe there are few time paradoxes or certain time travel elements that isn't fully connected or doesn't make complete sense, maybe some loopholes.

The idea to this film might not be entirely original but it has enough different elements to make it, it's own film. Plus a lot of ideas has already become movies or written before.

But when he fails to kill his older self the mafia wants him dead. Thus it's a triple a triple chase movie, but that is only part of the movie.

Now Bruce plays the older version of the main character named Joe but the real protagonist is the younger Joe. Played by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, now I don't know if it's the make up and everything or Josephs acting, probably both.

50_50," This movie might be separated 50/50 when it comes to the audiences, but I liked this movie
","This movie is a good blend of seriousness and comedy mixed into one film. Serious because of the cancer aspect of it and how a likable character deals with it. I would have passed on this movie to see it in theater but it has Joseph Gordon-Levitt facing cancer so it was a must watch. I didn't really like Seth Rogen in movies lately, well actually I just didn't care. But he was a key character in this movie and he was the one that actually added decent comedy elements to the movie. His character actually made the movie less depressing and bearable, because without his character this would have been a dark and just plain depressing. Mostly because Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character Adam is a guy that just let society and the people around him push him around while trying to do everything right. He doesn't smoke or anything like that and is a healthy guy and yet ironically he ends up with cancer. Not that cancer is something funny or anything like that but Seth Rogen played a important role for the lighthearted mood of it during certain parts or else the movie would have been just too serious. This isn't a groundbreaking movie about cancer but it's a believable movie about a guy dealing with cancer that has a 50/50 chance of surviving. It's a good movie that you will actually start to care abut the characters and actually had my attention most of the way through. The serious dramatic parts and comedic parts were blend in pretty well in this without being forced and even the romantic elements fit right in as well. It's a movie that is worth seeing at least once because of the good mix of different elements and because it has good character development.7.8/10",Null,1,2,1 October 2011
What We Do in the Shadows," Bloody fun and amusing time
","This is a very amusing mockumentary style movie that focuses in on a few vampires that act like brothers. And their dynamics with one another when it comes to doing choirs, when new comers get involved and how they go about dealing with humans. I didn't particularly find this to be hilarious, but I got a few laughs out of it and it was very amusing to sit through. Maybe it's because the actors played their parts so well to the point it just came off very natural. Maybe it's their personalities in real life, but the interactions came off amusing and natural. It really did seem like it's how the actors in this would act like if they were vampires. The executions when it comes to the vampire elements onto screen is very cleverly done. It's like they thought up a lot of fun and creative ideas when it comes to the vampire myths and mashed it all together into a mockumentary. But the thing is, it all works together fluently and it all fits together. To describe this mockumentary, it's like a mix of 'The Office', 'Borat' and 'Napoleon Dynamite' when it comes to the dynamics and vibe of it all. It start to slightly drag an hour in but overall it was a bloody good time.8/10",8,1,4,16 January 2017
Deadpool," Kickass and balls to the wall anti-hero
","With the superheroes movie being one of the major blockbusters in the film industry. They were churning out a lot it every year, while trying to up the game with each new installment. Whether it be with more action, more explosions, more bigger and convoluted plot. A film like this shows that even a superhero movie doesn't need much of that to be a really good superhero movie. Of course I think 'Deadpool' (2016) would have been better if it had a bit more budget to it. But it still gets the job done when it comes to the total package. I think one of the reasons why 'Deadpool' was such a huge hit on it's opening week was because of it's refreshing take on it. Sure, it coming out on valentine's day might have played a part in that. But I personally didn't see a superhero or anti-hero movie such as this one. It literally breaks the 4th wall and goes all out. The makers of this movie really fought to get this movie to get greenlit especially the actor Ryan Reynolds. He fought for almost a decade to get this movie to be made, because he really liked the character Deadpool. The character Deadpool was born before the comic book came out and his name Ryan Reynolds. I can think of other actors that can play certain superheroes. However Ryan Reynolds is one of the few when it comes to no one being as fit for the role as him. He has been playing Wade Wilson in a lot of his movies, except now they gave him a costume and a healing factor and allowed him to have no restraints...And you have Deadpool. When it came to the plot and direction of this film, it did a really good job. Especially when trying to carry on the comic book style on screen and having the right balance of action, comedy and a bit of drama. However I wished they would have gotten more in depth in certain areas. It's sort of how I felt when watching the first 'Iron Man' (2008) because it didn't show enough of Iron Man but that is only a small gripe. This movie does a lot of back and forth from the past to the present and for good reason. It's to keep the momentum going and keeping the story as fast-paced as it can be. It doesn't have a really well paced story but it's good enough and they did what they could with the resources they had in their arsenal. I mean they had nowhere near the budget of the 'Green Lantern' movie which even Ryan Reynolds took shots at. However it's not really the story that makes this movie stand out, but it's the execution when it comes to the character 'Deadpool' who is a fresh and very unique character that doesn't shy away from being wacky and fun when it comes to the Marvel universe on screen. While trying to stay true to the comic book source material a lot. And I thought they did a great job with that. I got the similar excitement, shock value and thrills from this almost to the level of 'Kick-Ass'. Except I liked 'Kick-Ass' more when comparing to the first time I saw it in theaters. Overall, this is a balls to the wall, kickass superhero or anti-hero movie that I would recommend checking out. They really pull no punches when it comes to what they wanted to show with the R rating. 'Deadpool' was a huge hit during opening week for different reasons.7.9/10",7,1,9,15 February 2016
Get Him to the Greek," So random, but still pretty damn funny
","Yeah sure this has random scenes in it a LOT in order to funny, but I can't really complain about that much cause the scenes that they want it to be funny, is actually pretty hysterical. Every characters in this was hysterical to watch, especially cause of the funny but awkward dialogue that is exchange between the characters. P.Diddy was actually pretty good in this film as well, especially when he goes haywire. The story is pretty simple, it's about a rocker that has a name that should belong in some Harry Potter book hits rock bottom or just the lowest point in his career and the character played by Jonah Hill tries to get him to a Greek concert with the permission of the producer P.Diddy, although he doesn't allow it at first. Anyways there is a lot of random funny stuff that happens along the way, although the ending is actually quite predictable it's still a hilarious film even if the plot is typical of getting a guy from point A to point B. It's not a smart comedy or a clever one, but it sure as hell a hilarious one.7.4/10",7,2,6,6 August 2010
Cloud Atlas," A decent movie that blends many elements into one...
","This is a ballsy film by the Wachowski's and others. It's a good movie but isn't something that would reach out to mainstream audiences. It has multiple different stories and scenarios and time periods incorporated into this one visceral film. But isn't done in a way that is all that engaging or intriguing. In fact just about all of the stories in this movie has been done before and better. It tries to blend love, time, karma, sacrifice, rebirth, freedom and hope into this one film. The wachowski's are visionary directors but there just didn't seem to have all that amazing of a imagination for this one. This movie is almost 3 hours but felt like a 3 hour movie and just didn't find it all that entertaining. It might be one of those movies that take multiple watches to get completely but I just didn't find this whole experience all that clever. The stories aren't told one by one but show a bit of one of the story then move onto another story then come back to another story. It has some good editing but the switching of the stories seemed to quick to the point it got kinda irritating to watch. All the actors and actresses in this is alright but mostly forgettable. Tom Hanks seemed to really want to try all the different accent and dialects he shows in this movie. Anyways when it tries to blend all the stories together to a certain point I found it weak. The most interesting story out of all of them for me is the Neo Seoul story set in the future. It's dark and yet gripping and captivating. All in all this is a watchable movie that blends many different elements into one and has some good or even great visuals.7.3/10",7,1,4,27 April 2013
300," Bloody good time!
","I saw this movie when I was in high school and was blown away by the experience. I remember seeing this in IMAX in a full theater and enjoyed every minute of it. The movie is a bit over 1 hour and 30 minutes, but it seemed shorter and I wanted more out of it. It's not a very satisfying movie in that regard but it's like being on a short entertaining thrill ride. This movie has badass written all over it. With the leader of the 300 Leonidas(Gerard Butler) becoming a iconic movie character. Quite a bit of the phrases has now become iconic phrases as well that people like to say or shout out. Sure when it comes to the story it doesn't have a lot of substance, but it has enough meat that just about any carnivores can chew down on and enjoy the feast with. When it comes the the environment it's mostly CGI and there is slow motion fight scenes, but I thought it was integrated and utilized so well in this. Sure, slow motion has been done before, but this brought in something new. What this movie does bring to the audiences, is basically guilty pleasure and it delivers in so many levels. What this movie is a war movie with Spartans that fight as a unit going up against the Persian army that outnumber them by huge numbers and it's awesome. This is a great adaptation from comic book to movie form that any movie goers that want to have a bloody good time can enjoy.8.6/10",8,1,4,17 May 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," An exquisite action movie
","There is directors that were inspired by the Bond films to make a parody out of it, such as 'Austin Powers' (film series). Than there are movies like 'Kingsman: The Secret Service' that does a good job taking the certain concepts of it like the gentlemen spy elements than adding there own touches to it. And this film really does succeed when it comes to the entertainment value of it all. I mean this is what the Alex Rider movie should have been. There has been movies about kids or teens becoming a secret agent and working for a agency. But I think this took the formula and polished it to the point where teens and adults can thoroughly enjoy it. It has a good build up, stand out characters and villains and well choreographed action sequences. Add good special effects with a story-line that is coherent and fits together well. Then you got yourself a action movie that is really worth seeing. It's a action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's really not campy either. Which makes this a balanced action movie when it comes to that department. Overall this is a exquisite film that I would recommend. It's quite fun.8.1/10",8,7,13,14 February 2016
The Hangover Part III," I wanted my money back
","Oh how the great has really really really fallen. This movie is the epitome of the reason why some movies should never ever get sequels. If it just ended with the first one, it would have stood as a legendary classic adult comedy but no. They just had to make more money off sequels that lacked any great or even good enough ideas to merit making sequels over. I really wanted my money back after watching this atrocious movie they call a comedy. None of the audiences even laughed or even chuckled including myself, except maybe for one joke near the end. None of the cast seemed to be trying anymore except maybe Zach Galifianakis and Ken Jeong. But even they just try to be overly obnoxious and tries so darn hard to be funny with crap materials. I was so anxious to leave the theater that I missed the extra footage at the end but I just didn't care.3.5/10",3,1,3,20 June 2013
Easy A," Emma Stone was the only one that stood out
","This is kinda like 'Mean Girls' and will remind you of 'Mean Girls' with a bit of a different premise. The main girl is actually likable for the most part in this one. I never found Emma Stone attractive although a their are probably a lot of guys and maybe girls that has a crush on her. Her character Olive really did stand out a lot in this movie, which could be a negative cause all the other characters just didn't have some great dialogue like she did. She just seemed to confident and too snappy. Which made the other characters just seem like side character that is just there so Olive can show off her witty dialogue. I enjoyed a lot of movies that Emma Stone was featured in and I liked this movie and her character as well. But what appears to be a smart teen comedy doesn't really have much of a message when it all comes down to it...Some but not much. It mainly revolves around promiscuity and the importance of it for some people in order to build their reputation. With rumors and gossiping going on as well, and STD playing big part in the story as well. The movie portray the Bible group as the villains in this one, lead by Amanda Bynes. I don't know what happened to Amanda but her face looked super bloated in this which was odd cause the rest of her body is skinny. Which made me wonder if they made her look like that on purpose or if she just has a fat face now. The movie offers few funny situations and some fun yet witty dialogue mainly from Olive(Emma Stone) with her remarks constantly and all, while the other characters just seem like cardboard. Which I think is the main flaw, just about every character is the same from beginning to end, even Olive so there really isn't anything to cheer for or anything. In another words no character development and hardly and win or losses. This film isn't a 'chick flick' but for anyone that likes a good comedy.7.6/10",7,0,2,6 October 2010
Fast Five," My favorite in the franchise so far, although it almost has nothing to do with street racing
","This really is my favorite in the franchise so far although it really isn't like any of the other films in this franchise in the past. In fact this one has to do with heist involving cars and has almost nothing to do with street racing at all. But that doesn't matter cause this is a entertaining movie with thrills and it's a real adrenaline rush. This really is a film for men with tough guys, suped up cars, insane action sequences, explosions, guns blazing and hot girls and etc. This movie is a definition of a entertaining popcorn flick. The plot is stupid but it's still sure fun to watch when the set pieces and action sequences are done in a very entertaining manner although very over the top. Physics don't apply in this movie at all and the crazy stuff happening on screen doesn't make any sense sometimes but that doesn't matter cause overall this is a stupid entertaining flick. Yeah it has a lot of elements guys like to see, but a lot of girls enjoyed this movie as well. The adrenaline runs out sometimes since the action and the stuff going on gets a bit tiresome after a while though. Most of the team members in the heist played the character off alright. And surprisingly The Rock(Dwayne Johnson) was pretty good in this playing the badass macho cop. This movie also has few scenes that are memorable that actually stands out, one of them is the scene where Vin Diesel and The Rock duke it out in a melee hand to hand fighting.8/10",8,1,3,2 May 2011
Honey," Not a bad dance flick but nothing special
","Honey has a dream to make it in life with dancing and she gets her big break when she is offered a job to be featured in a music video and a dance choreographer. The film had some decent ingredients although not very original, but it's a shame that the outcome is boring and predictable. It has some flashy dance moves in it but nothing remarkable, if I just wanted to watch some dancing I would watch some bboy videos instead. The part about Honey(Jessica Alba) being a good samaritan plays a big part near the end, but after the first hour, I was bored and just wanted it all to end. When I first saw the trailer, I was interested but nothing I wanted to rush out and see. But finally got around to watching it, and although the movie isn't that bad compared to other dance flicks out there it's nothing special either. If your interested or like hip-hop music videos give this a shot. I liked how they showed hip-hop in a respectful manner, but the dialogue and the interaction between the characters wasn't believable either. So a 5.3/10.",5,0,1,16 February 2010
The Great Escape," Inspirational filmmaking, but a bit boring from time to time.
","This isn't the most exciting or suspenseful escape movie. I was actually a bit bored from time to time while sitting through this one. But I do have respect and appreciation for this ensemble piece that is based on a true story. And how it tried to stay true to what really went down. I was surprised though at how it goes in a more civilized and whimsical direction despite it being a P.O.W. film. Even the intro music is whimsical and is very iconic to the point that there has been a lot of parodies done with that music. The main reason I wanted to check this movie out was because it is on the favorite movies list from some of my favorite directors. I can however see how this movie inspired some of the other directors and how they borrowed certain ideas from this movie. Maybe it's because the director decided to take more of a upbeat approach to the story. Since the cinematography and camera-work seems to be done from a distance to get wider shots, which sort of takes away from the tension and excitement. But maybe it was to get all the characters in without leaving anyone out. The running time is actually quite long, almost hitting the three hours mark. So a better editing and tightening of the script would have made this film more effective in my opinion. This is a P.O.W. movie the whole family can sit through without it offending anyone. Although the kids will most definitely will get bored sitting through this one. Overall, this was a fresh take on this genre and I didn't mind sitting through it. It's a movie that gives ideas, but just isn't something I would want to re- watch immediately.7/10",7,2,4,4 August 2016
Click," Some parts you want to fast forward in this movie
","This was a okay film, just not Adam Sandler's best. It just felt like they could have done more with the power to rewind, stop and fast forward time, cause it was mostly used for cheap gags which aren't even that funny and at the end it finishes off with sentimental stuff that sort of drags. The movie has a moral about how time is important and should not be put to waste and that there is value in the good times and the bad times of our lives, which was fine. So it was a nice comedy, just not a great one, cause when the credits start to roll it's not that satisfying and mediocre at best, it just wasn't that creative or engaging. Every other cast members did a good job, just wasn't noteworthy or anything. The thought that Adam Sandler's character is married to Kate Beckinsale's character wasn't believable either, he just didn't have a good personality and just came off as obnoxious and childish. Despite some flaws it's a okay comedy with a mix of emotions and a bit of cheap laughs, not a great one but isn't completely a waste of time, I give it a 6.8 and that is being very generous.6.8/10",6,1,2,24 October 2009
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," Enthralling vampire/drama film
","This is what dramatic vampire movies should be. Of course vampires are not real but this one goes in a direction and crafted in a way where it actually makes it seem like it can be possible. Brat Pitt and Tom Cruise make a excellent duo, well at least to watch. And their physical appearance and acting really fit the roles of vampires almost flawlessly. Especially Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat who is the show stealer in this movie. Although he is the vicious and selfish character that has a strong sense of vanity. But between the two his character is just more entertaining to watch and interesting. I guess because of his nature and mystery behind him or like most villains or anti-heroes they just know what they want. But this movie is basically a Brat Pitt film and his character is the main protagonist named Louis who gets turned into a vampire by Lestat. He is basically the emo character that whimper, sob and complains but sits back and basically does nothing most of the way through. And it's basically his melancholic journey after being turned into a vampire, which is actually enthralling to watch because of his surroundings. This is based on Anne Rice's first vampire novel and although I haven't read any of her books yet. I think this film did a good job of capturing the dark atmosphere. This is a well crafted and dark vampire movie that captures the essence of vampires and is a entertaining and interesting watch. And thanks to the two main actors performances this movie still stands out as a popular vampire movie and it's a shame there wasn't any sequels with the same cast. Unlike the 'Twilight' saga which should be forgotten.8.6/10",8,1,1,23 April 2013
Minions," Better than most spin offs
","This isn't a story driven movie nor is it a movie that has much depth to it. However it's a family flick where the kids will have a blast with. There is almost no slow parts in this, it's a super fast paced movie that will entertain just about any kid with it's wacky slapstick humor. The whole plot is about the Minions looking for a evil boss who they can work under. Soon Kevin, Bob and Stuart who are Minions volunteer to go on a mission to find a super cool evil boss. And their journey takes them on a wild adventure. The drive of this movie is the interactions between the Minions, their expressions and how they go about it. Which is actually pretty creative for the most part. Overall this is a movie kids will have a blast with it and adults will at least be amused with it.7.3/10",7,1,1,11 November 2015
Sin City," One of the best adaptation or transition from graphic novel to film
","I would say this is one of the best graphic novel series to film, but it feels more like a transition. In fact this is the closest I ever seen a graphic novel series to a film. It almost literally is like watching a graphic novel in film form and the visuals are just amazing. The plot has 3 different stories taking place in Sin City. And has 3 main male protagonists who are the epitome of badasses that have a soft spot for women. In fact the villains are the ones that treat women like trash in this flick. The character Marv(Mickey Rourke) is the brute force badass and tough as a human character in a movie can get. I can't think of anyone else that could of played Marve besides Mickey Rourke, he is just downright perfect for this role. In fact it's like Frank Miller designed Marv around Mickey Rourke, kinda like the new Nick Fury for Samuel L. Jackson. Next story's protagonist is Dwight McCarthy(Clive Owen) who is the slick and cool badass. And the third stories badass is Det. John Hartigan played by an actor who made his career from playing badass characters, none other than Bruce Willis himself. Overall this is one of the most entertaining, thrilling, gripping, violent and visually awesome movie I seen. This is what you get when a film is directed by Robert Rodriguez, co-directed by Frank Miller and guest directed by Quentin Tarantino.9/10",9,2,3,22 March 2013
The Ugly Truth," Yep I can handle 'The Ugly Truth'
","Now I liked this romantic comedy, it was clichÃ© at times and if you seen the trailer for this movie the chances of you knowing how just about everything is going to go down is pretty high, but still it is ambiguous and entertaining romantic comedy. Okay so Abby(Katherine Heigl) is producer of a local morning show in Sacramento, California. But she is a control freak and shallow which tends to turn most males off. Now I will say I don't particularly like Katherine Heigl as an actress but she actually fit in quite well with her role in this one. Anyways the ratings for the show starts to decrease, which isn't a surprise and the owner of the station decide to go in a different direction by hiring a brash talk show host Mike(Gerard Butler) who is a expert on male and female interaction and also the epitome of a alpha male. And Gerard Butler was just perfect in his role, even if his character is a know it all sleaze bag, but the thing is he is still likable and in this one even when he claims that he doesn't know romance or love, but that he is a master at lust and manipulation. Actually Gerard Butler is likable in just about every film he is in. So Mike takes up the offer to reprise his late-night call-in program 'The Ugly Truth' for the station. And the battle of the sexes begins between Mike and Abby, and they have some good chemistry together with some good dialogue mixed in while Abby tries to have a affair with her neighbor who she thinks is her ideal guy. But since most guys have difficult time having a affair with Abby which isn't that shocking, Mike makes a bet with Abby and gives her advice on how to please her so called ideal guy. And while doing this Mike and Abby start to bond with each other. Now like I said, it's a predictable romantic comedy but I enjoyed it, it is wicked fun even if the ending seemed to be really rushed. It's a romantic comedy that both sexes will enjoy and have a good time with, it was just simply satisfying.7.5/10",7,1,4,11 November 2009
Gangs of New York," Probably one of the most memorable roles by Daniel Day-Lewis
","Martin Scorsese is known for making great films and couple of gangster movies comes to mind. This isn't like the previous gangster films by Scorsese but it does have certain Scorsese elements that makes it a good watch. I personally didn't find it as gripping or compelling as his previous gangster films although this one does have few gripping moments. But just seem to lack in certain areas. It's still a good watch but for a Scorsese film there is this certain level of expectation for his films, and this one just didn't seem all that amazing. I remember watching this film when it first came out and thought it's a awesome freaking film but seeing it now, I can see how it's lacking in certain areas. The story is about groups of gangsters during the early stages of New York City. During a almost lawless time, it was basically the freaking wild west. It's a story about honor, vengeance, romance, friendship and patriotism. In another words it's one of those tough guy movies with a great story, this one is just underdeveloped in certain areas and might have worked better as a mini series. But the acting by Daniel Day-Lewis and the design of this film makes this one worthy of sitting almost 3 hours through it. The other actors were alright as well. Although Leonardo DiCaprio plays the narrator and the main protagonist and became Scorsese muse after this film. His character is basically this infiltrator in a gang like in one of those Hong Kong undercover cop films. This film is all about Daniel Day-Lewis as Bill the Butcher though. If there is a racist badass in a movie he would be it. Yeah, I know calling a racist a badass just doesn't go well together at all. But in this Daniel really puts on a memorable performance for his character. That and because Bill the Butcher although a gangster has certain code of honor that he sticks by. I guess even gangsters back than had certain rules and codes they stood by even when they fought in gang wars. Bill is a extreme patriot but a racist never the less but I can see why people would follow a guy like him in that era, despite his detestable and ruthless racist inner self, he is just so darn charismatic and intimidating. Plus there was a lot of racists that actually did some malicious acts during the period this film takes place. Anyways in another words Bill is a very memorable villain, although Bill might see himself as a true patriot and maybe even a hero. This is the role I will know Daniel Day-Lewis for and maybe his role as Abraham Lincoln. Cameron Diaz is alright as the love interest in the story. But reminded me a lot of Cameron's role in 'Feeling Minnesota', even the direction of her character is similar. Basically about a girl that is unsatisfied with her life so wants to run away to another state while leading some guy on. Overall this is a film that has a good build up but seemed rush near the end and somewhat underdeveloped for this types of stories. And wanted to see a bit more development in certain areas. But this film is still a Scorsese film that shouldn't be missed.8/10",8,0,0,4 May 2013
The Cabin in the Woods," Refreshing take on horror...Or horror/comedy
","What this is, is a refreshing take on the horror genre because of the twist in the movie. You can see the twist sort of in the beginning but you won't entirely know exactly what is going on until it comes close to the end. This takes the very generic aspects of horror slasher flicks and sort of takes jabs at it in a fun way. Even all the college students are very generic to the horror genre. The pop culture horror elements are in this but not so it can head in a very generic slasher flick direction. This has been done before but it doesn't seem outdated at all so far. But it all has purpose, well majority of it. I can't really talk much about this movie cause it can ruin it for the viewers. But what I will did find a bit shocking is how the movie is a bit more humorous than scary. It's not like 'Shaun of the Dead' funny but some situations are so awkward it gets pretty darn funny. Now I wasn't laughing hysterically throughout this movie but the humor actually blends in pretty well with the horror aspect of it. What first leads to a generic slasher flick with all the generic slasher flick elements leads to much more. I rarely watch slasher flicks more than once but this one I might see again. It's a good thing the trailer didn't give much of anything away which is rare for trailers now a days.7.6/10",7,1,5,15 June 2012
Spectre," Solid entry
","This movie has been getting quite a bit of gripe from the critics and I can see certain flaws in this movie. But I think most of the negativity is from how classy and good 'Skyfall' was. And yeah, 'Skyfall' is the better movie but this is actually a good Bond movie as well. It does have certain formulaic and structured direction going for it, mainly because it tries to add the classic Bond elements into this. It's still a fun movie to sit through and personally, I just wasn't really bored with it. Sure, some parts did seem slightly drawn out but for the most part it's a fun spy action movie. I can also see why some viewers might compare this movie to 'Mission Impossible 5'. But this has a very different vibe and different flare going for it, it is a James Bond movie after all. As a matter of fact I enjoyed this movie as much as I enjoyed 'Mission Impossible 5'. The action sequences was cool and the fight between James Bond and Mr. Hinx was brutal and it's one of the top one on one fight sequences I have seen that does not involve kung-fu. Mr. Hinx is like Nemesis from 'Resident Evil 3' except he is human of course. However it's a movie that didn't seem to have a direct sense of direction sometimes and did seem inconherent few times, not as much as 'Quantum of Solace' though. And it's a much better movie than 'Quatum of Solace'. The cinematography is also the best I have seen in a Bond movie as well. I personally enjoyed this movie enough to see it twice in theaters.8.5/10",8,14,29,14 November 2015
Happy Feet," Singing and dancing penguins
","This is a good animated movie, just not a great one. So the premise is this, each penguin has a heart song in order to find a spouse and to fit into penguin society. But the penguin named Mumble doesn't have a singing voice but backs it up with tap dancing and his funk. With the penguin society finds to be blasphemy. But Mumble uses his talents to try and help the penguin society while falling in love. The dialogue and direction is also very corny even for a family movie though but after a while it doesn't seem that bad. The animation is fluid and cool to watch as well, which is the highlight of this movie. What I found funny though was how for a kids movie it has a lot of sexual or slightly provocative lines even when it came to the music sometimes but the audiences just seemed to let it slide because it goes in a very cute direction. To sum it up this is like a animated musical with penguins. Some aspects of the story I found to be laughable how the older generation of penguins look down on younger generations of penguins for getting into a bit of modern style of dancing. Cause it comes off a bit clichÃ© and found it funny they put the same thing for a animated movie with penguins. And how having fun is looked down upon by older the older penguins and thought of as a bad thing for penguin society. This animated movie seems a bit drawn out and a bit dull but when it's finished overall it's a good movie that is worth seeing. And you could tell a lot of effort has been put into this animated movie. It would have been great if the movie amount to the effort put into it.7.1/10",7,0,0,17 February 2012
Her," Not a typical romance film
","I have seen movies and shows about a human having relationship with a cyborg, but not with a AI without a body. And that is what this movie is about, a very likable average guy that starts a relationship with a female AI. I can say it's a new type of romance with a story that connects with the real world for few people. I mean there are people that actually marries video game dating characters and such. This film does a good job of integrated just about every aspect when it comes to a guy having a relationship with a highly advanced AI. Story like this might be creepy to viewers but it does a fine job of making the romance seem natural and understandable. Although few times I felt things were getting dragged out it gets my attention again. This experience sort of reminded me of 'Lost in Translation'. This is another fine installment from Spike Jonze. It would have been a crazy twist if the whole thing was just a experiment and it was a real human on the other line. Although that would have ticked off a lot of the audience members.7.6/10",7,0,0,14 April 2014
The Nice Guys," It's a neo-noir black comedy with clichÃ© opposite characters teaming up to solve a crime BUT the dynamics is very refreshing
","This is a fast paced, a bit crude but clever black comedy. Now I thoroughly enjoyed other previous films that Shane Black directed such as 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'. Which is another cleverly executed neo- noir black comedy. I was amused and entertained with 'The Nice Guys' from start to finish. Despite it having few parts where the momentum drops slightly. This is a team up movie of opposites, while Holland March(Ryan Gosling) has the professional title of being a private investigator. But is not really professional and lacks integrity in just about every aspect. He is one of those characters that tries to act cool, but loses his cool when things that getting serious and is the ultimate clutz. However for some reason luck seems to be on his side when things get dangerous. Russell Crowe plays a Enforcer for hire that does not have the professional title of a private investigator but is more professional than his partner. He is a tough guy, that looks tough, knows how to keep his cool and is just really good at handling things. The dynamic between these two characters surprisingly work well without it getting annoying to watch with constant bickering. This is a cleverly executed film with fun dynamics, cleverly executed humor which is rare these days and the scenarios is just so darn amusing. I still think 'Kiss Kiss Bang Bang' is the better film but I really enjoyed this one as well.8.5/10",8,3,9,27 July 2016
Mad Max: Fury Road," One heck of a thrill ride
","So when it comes to the story, it might seem like there really isn't anything special when it comes to the story. The plot is about going from point A to point B and back to point A again. Now the 'Mad Max' franchise is considered cult films and although I am not a big fan of this franchise but I thought it does have certain imageries that make it stand out. Although the third installment was the weakest and is probably why there wasn't a new 'Mad Max' movie for many years. I will say 'Fury Road' is one heck of a insane experience, filled with chaos and madness. Again what makes this movie stand out is the crazy imagery and atmosphere. If you are a fan of steampunk style genres than you will probably have a blast with this one. This movie is wild and crazy and yet there wasn't really any shaky cam and yet the cinematography is really well done and super cool. Now I still think Mel Gibson did a better job of play Max, mainly because of the insane look in Mel's eyes, but Tom Hardy bring something new. He sort of reminded me of his character from Lawless a bit. Which is this confused badbass. Although the title says 'Mad Max' the really title for this should have been 'Badass Chick with the Metal Arm'. Because Charlize Theron seemed to be the main protagonist throughout most of the film. And she is badass as a badass female lead can get. Call me blind, but I never really found Charlize to be attractive, sure I could understand why she is known to be one of the most beautiful actresses in the business. But man she was really hot in this one. Which shows that sometimes more than appearance how you carry yourself can really bring out the attractiveness. This is a exploitation film for the mainstream audiences, that is a fun thrill ride from beginning to end without it dragging out. Overall, this is a film that almost every movie buffs can have a good time with. I usually don't watch the same movie twice in theaters, but I did for this one. Once in regular and the other time in 3D.8.5/10",8,3,11,22 May 2015
Hacksaw Ridge," Incredible story about conviction, family and honor.
","This is a film about prejudice against sensitive men and their conviction. Which is thoroughly shown through the mistreatment of Desmond Doss. Who is a stand up guy that wanted to do good for his country by being a medic for the wounded soldiers in battle. The mistreatment came from Doss being a pacifist and for him sticking to his conviction not to kill but to save lives instead in battle by being a medic. Which leads to Doss facing hatred, trials and hazing from the other soldiers because they all think he won't be able to protect them in battle. This is based on a true story of conviction, family and honor. And it's directed very well from the build up to the convincing and engaging violent battle sequences for the second half. Andrew Garfield plays a lovable character as Desmond T. Doss. Garfield did a great job playing Desmond T. Doss as this dorky, lovable, kind and honorable guy. I am going to be very honest though, during the whole film he reminded me of Fix It Felix Jr. from 'Wreck-It Ralph'. As a matter of fact if Fix It Felix Jr. came to real life in human form it would be Andrew Garfield in this film. This is a powerful movie about a man standing up for his conviction at all cost. And the brutality of war and the incredible and inspirational will power a honorable man had when it came to saving lives. It's a film that I can highly recommend to just about anyone.9/10",9,4,9,21 January 2017
Warcraft," For a movie based on a MMORPG this is alright
","For a movie based on a video game this movie is alright. It isn't a great movie but for a movie based on a video game it's a okay watch although that ain't saying much. I am not a WOW player so I didn't know a lot of the key characters and elements that are in the game. I however thought it's a watchable cheesy fantasy movie with passable drama and passable CGI action sequences. Most of the well known actors just didn't seem to give a crap and it seemed like they were in it just for the paycheck. Although Paula Patton put in a lot of emotion and effort for this role as the half-human half-orc. Travis Fimmel didn't seem to give a crap about this role at all, like he is in his interviews. The guy seemed to have tried harder in the TV show Vikings over this. I guess since it's a movie based on a popular video game he didn't want to care since he probably isn't a gamer himself. Personally I don't think they should have used real actors and used CGI characters with motion capture instead. Like in 'Kingsglaive' which came out recently and in my personal opinion is the better fantasy film. The CGI character even acts better than the real life actors in this one. Overall, if you are into MMORPG or a fan of WOW you will probably enjoy this for what it brings. While it tries to stay close to the truth to the source material...Or at least I think. But to others that aren't even into fantasy as well should probably pass on this one.6/10",6,4,7,8 September 2016
The Runaways," Unoriginal rock n roll flick
","This film does have a good visual style, but nothing about is really interesting. Didn't give a crap about any of the characters in this as well, although it's based on a true story. The plot is basically about a group of girls mainly focusing on the members Joan Jett(Kristen Stewart) and Cherie Currie(Dakota Fanning) and both the actresses that played them did a decent job. Anyways they are trying to make it as a band during a time when girls was looked down upon for doing those things, such as rock n roll. And although it has the clichÃ© sex, drugs and rock n roll scenes that is very clichÃ© in this film, it just was not interesting what so ever. The performances of the main 'The Runaways' were well done but that is the only positive thing I can think of in this film. Yeah it shows some of the characters like Joan Jett and Cherie Currie going through tough times, but didn't really care for it or had my sympathy. A group of young girls forming the first all-girl rock band may seem like a good idea, but it just wasn't well crafted. Mainly because nothing about this film was original in anyway, everything in this has been done before except much better and lacks depth.4.6/10",4,1,6,8 September 2010
Donnie Darko," One of the best cult film!
","This is one of the most captivating and compelling cult movie I have ever seen. The blending of religion, time travel, destiny and the end of the world is just done almost flawlessly. And constantly kept my interest from beginning to end. Movies like this show that you don't need a huge budget to make a entertaining and intriguing doomsday movie. The story is basically about a teenage boy that has emotional problems named Donnie Darko(Jake Gyllenhaal) that deals with family and high school life and has interactions about different philosophical views on the meaning of life. While also finding out about time travel and destiny and the end of the world. And how he copes with it all and what route he decides to take in the end. What is great about this movie is how it dives into the mindset of Donnie and what is happening to his surroundings without giving too much away. And that is one of the key elements of this movie, it gives enough but it leaves enough for the audiences imagination. By leaving certain mysteries around everything that happened. In another words it doesn't insult the audiences intelligence and yet doesn't purposefully try to be all confusing in order for it to seem like a clever movie. Overall, this is a must watch film.9.3/10",9,1,4,12 April 2013
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," No more than meets the eye, but it's alright this time.
","The critics seem to be bashing the hell out of this movie, maybe it's because the second installment was just uber terrible. But this time around it wasn't that bad in my opinion. Now I can see why professional reviewer or critics gave this movie a negative review, I guess they just had to. The story is just so clichÃ© and predictable and there is almost no character development in this. Saying this movie is better than the second installment isn't saying much, since that one was pretty much garbage besides the special effects and action. But this time there is much better set pieces and it has the most action from the three movies in this franchise and the action sequences are more well done and more fun to watch. However the constant explosions gets a bit tiresome after a while, explosions and a lot of actions is what this film is known for with robots beating the crap out of each other. But after a while with things constantly blowing up and stuff flying around everywhere for a long period of time it gets tiresome. But didn't get super irritating because of it and was worth sitting through those sequences. The build up is however crappy and so is the climax, there is one twist I didn't see coming but overall everything was so damn clichÃ© and predictable. With the humans on the brink of destruction there was no tension and there was no parts that was actually gripping. You will not care who dies or lives when it comes to the humans or which robots get destroyed for the most part. Also Shia again taking on the main role as sam again got irritating after a while cause all he does most of the way through in the story is constantly whine about his life and how he can't get a job. One of my co-worker was like this and it was a real pain to work with him and didn't want to see the same crap on the big screen, ironically he is a big fan of this franchise and Linkin Park. Unlike the 2nd installment however things stayed consistent for the most part and didn't go all over the place in negative manner, which is a plus. I didn't really like the new girl taking the place of Megan Fox, not that I was a big fan of Megan Fox but she was better than the girl that took her role in this. Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is shot in a very sexual way but didn't leave a impact or made the movie better, the audience for the most part didn't seem to care how her assets were expose a bunch of time on screen. Except the annoying 14 yr old kid that was sitting on the next seat in theater that seemed to go bonkers over it and constantly made stupid remarks or talked on his phone. Micheal Bay must have a big grudge against Megan Fox cause here character gets insulted multiple times in this movie. Anyways overall this was a good summer flick that has some entertaining action sequences, the war between the Autobots and Decepticons at the end was satisfying and felt it was worth the price of admission this time around. Oh and Optimus Prime is a badass robot in this as well.7.4/10",7,1,6,2 July 2011
The Social Network," Good movie, just overpraised
","When I first saw the trailer to this in theater, I thought it was ridiculous and stupid. Like they are really running out of ideas, but to some degree it beat my expectation. I personally didn't think it was a masterpiece like some critics claim, but David Fincher did a very good job with what he had. The plot is basically about college students at each others throat for a idea a site that is worth billions. Now Jesse Eisenberg has been getting a lot of credit for his portrayal of Mark Zuckerberg and for the most part he did a pretty good job, but I didn't find it outstanding or anything like that. I mean he played his role very well but didn't think it was anything special or anything like that, his character just had one note. But besides that he did nail the character very well. Andrew Garfield did a really good job as well with his character and showed a lot of emotional depth. In fact the acting and dialogue of this movie is almost flawless. Now there maybe many viewers that may not enjoy this movie as much, I personally thought it was pretty good though, with the bickering, backstabbing, betrayal, and greed that lead to making facebook. And shockingly Justin Timberlake put on a great performance. Who knew that guy could actually act. But he was probably just playing himself. Just not a amazing awesome movie that some critics claim it to be, I mostly liked the visual style of it all. Again the best part about this movie is the performance and the sharp dialogue. And I know this movie is about how facebook came about, but it wouldn't have hurt to dove into the mind of Zuckerberg more and more development. The film just didn't grab my interest, it didn't really have a good start but got my attention a bit during the middle and started to lose it when it got near the end. This really isn't a bad film, it has good camera techniques to go with some of the positive aspect of the film I named. But the topic at hand just isn't interesting, and didn't feel all that compelling.7.4/10",7,0,1,17 February 2011
Macbeth," Just didn't seem like a completed movie
","There has been different adaptations for Macbeth, like Akira Kurosawa's 'Throne of Blood' or the horror like adaptation of Macbeth by Roman Polanski. This 2015 version by Justin Kurzel leans more towards war, hierarchy and brutality. If your an audience member that enjoy poetry, art and plays you might enjoy this one. But most mainstream audiences might get bored with this one. The theater audiences main complaint was how they try to transition the Shakespeare play exactly. My main gripe was the editing and the transition of the scenes and storytelling. It just felt like a lot of in-depth portion was either missing or rushed at times. The acting in this is good for the most part although the portrayal of Lady Macbeth by Marion Cotillard seems to be off. It's not the actresses fault since she really brought her A game, but it just seemed like she was a bit of a miscast. She just lacked the lethal and ambitious edge and lacked the empowered woman aspects to her character. She just looked feeble throughout the whole thing. I know the director was trying to go with a more artistic direction and the movie is stylish and the cinematography near the end is pretty cool. But the movie itself as a whole just wasn't all that satisfying.6.8/10",6,2,4,7 December 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," I enjoyed this one as much as the first one.
","Despite 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' being the more well known one in this franchise and it being more of a classic. 'The Last Crusade' played a bigger part during my childhood and as a child I just had more fun watching this one. It just had everything I enjoyed watching as a kid meshed into one film. I do appreciate 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' as an adult, but this one was movie magic for me. It's also the installment that really got me into the character Indiana Jones and I wanted to emulate him. I really liked the dynamics between the characters, especially with Indy and his father. Their interactions between them was humorous and yet heartfelt in all the right parts. As a matter of fact, they got the humor right this time around. It's placed in all the right parts without it feeling like it's forced. The twists and the set pieces was spot on. And it really did bring about that authenticity while still carrying on that torch of it being a fun adventure film. There is also a lot more going on in this film with most of the main cast playing a part when it comes to the core of the story. It really was a masterful send off to this franchise...Well until Spielberg decided to direct 'The Kingdom of the Crystal Skull'.10/10",10,0,0,7 January 2017
Back to the Future," A blast from the past!
","If you wanna watch a very intelligent time travel movie, this one isn't it. However if you wanna see the beginning of a fantastic, adventurous yet well interwoven, grafted and entertaining time travel trilogy this one is the ticket. The thing that makes this movie stand out and endure the test of time is the classic elements that makes a movie such as this memorable with likable characters. And a mission you actually care about as the audience members. Michael J. Fox is just great a Marty McFly who may seem like a typical 80's main teenage character, but there is certain aspects about him that makes him a cool and stands out from the rest. Maybe it's his capability to stand up to bullies even if he is smaller in stature. While also having the courage to follow his dreams and how he conducts himself, despite his flaws of not being able to turn down a challenge. But Christopher Lloyd is the guy that just plain downright nailed it as the wacky scientist Dr. Emmett Brown. Even when it came down to the main villain Biff played by Biff Tannen, who is basically a generic bad guy of this trilogy, but certain elements makes him kind of a stand out villain for me. Maybe because you can see different versions of him, even if he is the bad guy all the way through. Watching this movie was like watching a Jerry Bruckheimer movie with a touch of Spielberg's elements, except this trilogy will go down as a classic trilogy. This may seem like a typical 80's movie from the surface, but it has a lot of elements that makes it brilliant. It's difficult to describe in words, but this movie, this trilogy just works and will stick with you. When it comes to the story it's actually very simple, but sometimes the simple aspect of a film makes it more worthwhile sometimes even if it deals with time travel. Watching this even now I can understand why a movie like this can be a timeless classic and give kids a colorful imaginative ideas. I for one tried to build a time machine with my brother when we were younger after watching this movie and had a blast! 9/10",9,1,1,28 May 2014
The Bourne Supremacy," Not good as the first Bourne movie, but still a solid sequel
","Not good as the first Bourne movie but this is still a solid sequel. This time Jason Bourne is dealing with a more difficult assassin and is way more troublesome compared to the past assassins Bourne had to deal with. There is a lot more stuff going on this time around but it isn't really as engaging or entertaining as the first one. It's still a pretty good movie though and executed very well. What this is, is a big chase movie with Jason Bourne trying to figure out why he is being targeted. Like I said, not good as the first Bourne movie but still a worthy sequel.7.9/10",7,0,1,10 April 2011
The Proposal," A very generic romance comedy
","This movie is probably one of the most generic and dull romance comedy I have ever seen. It's just way too predictable and the humor and morality is like from a very very long time ago. I got a few chuckles from some scenes but that is about it, the film was just not funny for me. As a matter of fact the only people that I saw laughing was old people, and I am not trying to be biased against old people or anything and I seen plenty of old people that enjoy rude and crude comedy, but this film was just way to old fashion and just tries too hard to be cute. I am not saying a movie that goes about it with cute humor is necessarily a bad thing, but it just isn't funny and it's very dull and generic. There is also a scene where Sandra Bullock comes out of the shower almost naked which almost makes you wanna gag. I guess it was trying to be one of those sweet comedies, and lot of old people and some girls may enjoy this movie and probably worth a rent when watching it as couple.4/10",4,4,6,8 October 2009
13 Hours," A different Michael Bay movie.
","So for a Michael Bay movie, this wasn't over the top with dumb jokes thrown in all over the place. This isn't a very intelligent movie that delves into the politics. However it does a good job of focusing in the on the characters and give them actual personalities that the viewers can connect with. The plot is about Private Military Contractor team that are stationed in ,Benghazi, Libya and take on tasks that deals with security. But things start to get horribly wrong when a army of Islamic militants that are angry start attacking. For a Michael Bay movie it doesn't focus in on just the explosions but he actually tried to make it a military movie with some pretty darn good action sequences in it. I thought it was odd to put a actor like John Krasinski as a military guy in a movie such as this. I thought the actor pulled it off pretty well. He had the balance of being a tall every day guy with common sense that is fit and built but doesn't constantly act like a butch robotic killing machine. Despite his experience in the military he doesn't come off like a typical military guy in movies that tries to act tough all the time and I liked that because it was refreshing. Overall I thought this was a well done movie worth a watch. Nothing amazing or anything like that but it's worth a watch. I would have given it a higher score if the build up was a bit more interesting. Instead of it being the typical military characters build up with them having families so the audiences can have more of an attachment with them.7.3/10",7,1,6,6 June 2016
Warm Bodies," Nothing special...Despite the premise
","I really wanted to be entertained with this flick but I just didn't find this movie to be all that enjoyable as I wanted it to be. If you seen the trailer everything about this flick is predictable and they put all the best parts in the trailer. Although this happens often and just lacked good development, emotion and humor. It's a romance flick that might get guy's attention since it's about a romance between a zombie and a human girl. But that is basically the only unique thing about this flick. What irritated me the most is the constant plot-holes that just doesn't make any sense. Usually I try to look past this but it just becomes to much. It's like they just didn't care and wanted to make a zombie romance flick. There is also this group of monsters called the Boneys, it's basically monsters that transformed from being zombies after a long period of time. But they are just in this flick so the humans and zombies can have a common enemy. The script just didn't seem well crafted or unique despite the human zombie relationship aspect of this story. Vampire romance has been done many times, even werewolves and other monsters or creatures and now it's zombies. And that is where this movie falters, it's just quickly becomes boring despite the premise. It's a watchable movie and better than the 'Twilight' flick but just nothing special. I wouldn't be shocked if the makers of this was inspired by a video on Youtube called 'Zombie Love Song' which is a more entertaining to watch.6.2/10",6,1,5,18 May 2013
Sully," A stand out factual movie about a stand up guy
","This is based on the true incident where a disabled plane full of passengers was landed on the Hudson River by Captain Chesley 'Sully' Sullenberger. Because a flock of birds disabled the engines by flying into it. And the core of the story revolves around if Sully is really a hero when it came to his decision making. Or is there other factors that play a part in this, which would make his decision at that moment to be the wrong choice. Maybe he is a scapegoat and the fall guy to point the finger at so companies wouldn't have to take full responsibility for the damages. Now what I liked about this movie is how Clint Eastwood didn't try to make a pretentious and over dramatic movie. But just show the facts and what Sully was going through during before, during and after the accident. The most interesting parts was during the investigation after the Hudson landing. And the inner turmoil and anxiety that Sully was going through. Now Tom Hanks is the actor that really brought the emotions of the pilot in a very engaging manner. Overall, this is one of those movies that is based mostly on facts that the audiences will get the most out of if they care to know about the aftermath.7/10",7,1,3,12 January 2017
Jurassic Park," Still holds up today!
","I remember watching this movie when I was just a elementary school student and wasn't all that entertained with this movie. Except the dinosaur parts since it just didn't meet my prospect of things when it comes to a entertaining movie when I was a kid. But watching it now, I can really appreciate this movie and what it does. In fact it's one of the best dinosaur or some creatures that attack people type of movies I have ever seen. I recently saw this movie in theaters in 3D and it still meets even today's standards when it comes to great movies. Steven Spielberg is a visionary director and he really put everything he had into this movie. The CGI still holds up but what amazes me is how they used animatronic dinosaurs for the dinosaur scenes. This movie came out in 1993 and even the cinematography still hold up. The characters are well grafted into the story and stands out despite the two annoying kids. Even if it does have slightly clichÃÂ© moments with one of the character predicting all the outcome but most of the people just won't listen to the guy scenarios. But then again this movie came out in 1993. The build up is just fantastic in this movie and although a bit far-fetched the way it's shown makes it believable, like everything in this movie is possible. The plot is about a rich old guy that decides use his money to clone dinosaurs and make a dino theme park but things just doesn't go according to plan. And it really does seem like a real theme park, mainly because of all the small details and effort that is put in the settings and backgrounds. Even the freaking theme song is so darn catchy and memorable. Go watch this movie in theaters now! It's what movie going experience is all about.9/10",9,6,7,10 April 2013
Valkyrie," A wasted opportunity
","I slightly feel bad for liking the fictional 'Inglourious Basterds' over this one. It had some many opportunities to be a great film, but turned out as just a good film. That just doesn't stand out compared to the other based on a true story films out there. It's basically a missed opportunity, it lacked the depth, detail, suspense and tension which could have made this whole ordeal more riveting to sit through. But it just seems to go by the numbers over it being a emotionally gripping and investing film. If I wanted to see a factual straight by the numbers film, I would have probably preferred watching documentary because this felt bland although it revolves around a serious and important issue and people that shouldn't be forgotten for their efforts. Tom Cruise did a fine job as Colonel Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg who was one of the pioneer of the Coup d'Ã©tat in order to get rid of a sadistic tyrant. Not a noteworthy role for Tom Cruise but he does carry this film to a certain degree. It's just that Bryan Singer is the wrong director to direct this film that had the potential to be great. He should probably stick to more of the fictitious films over a film that needs intelligent build ups and more depth to it. Not saying Bryan Singer is a bad director, this was just not the right film for him to direct. Overall, it's a alright watch but a wasted opportunity.7/10",7,1,1,15 January 2016
The Wizard of Oz," One of the most memorable journey and musical numbers
","This movie is a notorious classic and I finally got the chance to see it. Although the main reason is because 'Oz The Great and Power' came out which I am sorta ashamed of. For a movie that came out in 1939 this is a great accomplishment. The musical numbers really stand out and even when the movie is over some of the tunes, actually just about all of the tunes was stuck in my head. The musical numbers all just really stick and although the adventure is simple it's memorable. Some of the virtues and morals in this movie can be questionable to some, but it's well blended into the story. In fact the musical numbers and the journey in this is more memorable than 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory'. Especially since it has musical numbers like 'Over the Rainbow'. There is a reason why just about everyone has at least heard of or somewhat know about 'The Wizard of Oz'. This is a fantastic musical journey that I highly recommend.8.3/10",8,3,4,30 March 2013
The Soloist," Lacks inspiration of the human spirit
","When I saw the trailer for this film, I had somewhat decent expectations for it, it wasn't high enough for me to rush out to theaters and watch it but thought it would be a decent and inspiring film, but was left disappointed. I haven't seen a movie about music for a while, especially about classical music so I decided to give this film a try. And the story follows the simple formula of a chance encounter changes a man's life. But this film just drags and drags to the point you feel like falling asleep, what they did was take a simple story and made it run longer than it should have. Cause you could simply tell the creators was running out of ideas, cause it didn't go anywhere. Just a white man constantly trying to a help a black man, but the black man is ungrateful cause he hits the black man for trying to help him although black man says stuff along the lines of loving him even if he has schizophrenia. Even if this is based on a true story, it is very difficult to buy into Robert Downey Jr's character and why he is trying so hard to help Jamie Foxx's character. I will however say that Robert and Jamie give good performances and as far as dramas go I seen way worse, this one is just not that interesting. Not as good as 'Resurrecting the Champ' which was a better movie.6.7/10",6,0,0,21 October 2009
The Martian," Survival story that takes place on Mars
","This is a highly intelligent and very well executed film. It almost made me believe this movie was based on a true story. The cast did their parts really well and it really seemed like they were actually real professionals working for NASA. Matt Damon seems to be a part of a meme now because he gets put in positions where other characters has to put a lot of effort into saving him with this being the 3rd time of that happening in a film. But yeah he was really good in this as the astronaut that gets left behind and has to survive using his intellect and resources at his disposal. And keeping on very optimistic perspective on things despite it dire situation. Which is the reason why he kept chugging away at it without not even trying. While this is going on, the greatest minds on earth are working on a way to bring him back home alive by using their brains, wits and will power. It's like watching nerds working on science projects after science projects to accomplish something really cool. The ideas and direction just kept getting more clever and clever as it progressed. And as it progresses the build up makes you really care as an audience on what is going to happen and because it actually feels like a lot is at stake, although it's a rescue mission to save one man. So near the end, there is quite a bit of tension. I mean I wanted to get out of my seat and cheer although it's a fictional event. I also liked the message at the end about not giving up and keeping hope alive. This isn't a movie that I would want to see again immediately, but it's a really good movie to sit through at least once.8.5/10",9,2,5,26 December 2015
The Fighter," Knock out performances from both actors
","This is a movie where Mark Wahlberg is literally phenomenal in and this role was just perfect for him. Christian Bale hasï»¿ it locked for best supporting actor. The plot is basically based on a true story about a welter weight boxing champion Micky Ward(Mark Wahlberg) and the plot is a back story to what happened before he became the champion. And all the obstacles he had to overcome in the ring and outside the ring to reach success in boxing. The story is pretty good but the movie can be a bit slow at times and loses it's edge sometimes, however the acting is fantastic, even the minor characters stood out. Christian Bale gain and lose weight like magic and in this he had to lose a lot of weight, and he was a slightly better than Mark Wahlberg in this. His character was dramatic and funny, Amy Adams was pretty good in this and proves she is a good actress in this. Overall the performances in this is plain out amazing for the most part. On a negative side there really isn't a lot of fight scenes in this, and the fight sequences is okay but isn't anything great. The script and dialogue is what makes this movie really stand out, although it's pretty predictable and narrow at times. For a boxing movie this focuses more on the family drama and boxing is there as well but it isn't the entire focus of the movie. This is a realistic and believable film that is for the most part a knock out.8.2/10",8,0,0,13 February 2011
Evil Dead II," 'Groovy'
",This one actually surpasses the original in just about every way. Out of the 'Evil Dead' trilogy most people refer to 'Evil Dead 2' for a reason. Two is basically what makes this trilogy stand out. This is probably the film that made Ash a iconic figure in the horror genre and probably made the chainsaw the iconic horror weapon. It's more crazy and humorous than before and has way more supernatural elements going on. In fact this time the whole cabin looks like it's been possessed. Bruce Campbell again plays Ash but he now feels like a trademark character in these genre. His facial expressions and his crazy laughs are a classic. Everything is just more humorous this time around in a good way. It just has many innovative elements which adds onto the originality from the first. This one is a classic for a reason and shouldn't be missed out on. Especially if your into the horror genre.8.6/10,8,4,5,7 May 2013
Law Abiding Citizen," I got what I wanted out of it
","I had high expectations for this film to be entertaining...And I wasn't disappointed. It wasn't a dumb film but it just wasn't plausible, but despite it being implausible it was sure entertaining. I could relate with this film as well since it has to do with the justice system having a lot of flaws and I was screwed before cause of it as well like many others. But Clyde Shelton who is a character played by Gerard Butler got screwed really bad, his wife and daughter gets brutally murdered in the beginning of the movie and the killers just gets away with a tap on the wrist by the justice system. This film made me question what is right and what is wrong and the boundaries and what justice really is cause there really isn't a definite form of justice, Clyde Shelton doesn't seem to be fighting for his family but for himself as well although you can't help but cheer for the guy. The character Jamie Foxx played wasn't a likable character even if he thinks he is on the right side of the law, he just doesn't give a crap about his client or even tries to be in the shoes of the victims but acts like it's just a poker game regardless of the case and goes about bragging about his 96% conviction rate and while thinking his life is fine and dandy, he was just mundane throughout the film. The story fast forward to 10 yrs later after the entire smug legal system that basically leaving the client behind and just basically telling him to shut up and the rampage begins with Clyde Shelton getting some payback and trying to take down the system with some cool twist and turns that keeps you on the edge of your seat. What I really liked about the film is that it doesn't just show the victims perspective but Clyde Shelton's perspective as well when he goes on a rampage, and the guy definitely has a right to be angry so some of his kills are satisfying cause you feel they deserved it, and he is not just a badass but also intelligent and elaborate. I thought every actor and actress got the right amount of screen time, except Josh Stewart cause his talent went to complete waste. Gerard Butler starts off being a hero that just about everyone can cheer for cause let's face it we all been screwed by the legal system while not really being a terrorist and I was with him in till he becomes the super villain. The disappointment of this film is that just about every character in this film is just not likable and the message of the screwed up system gets lost as the film progresses. If this film was ballsier and ambiguous I would have given it a higher rating, but despite that it was a entertaining one and you won't feel cheated while watching it in theaters it just ain't a deep movie. Oh yeah and whats up with that scene where Gerard Butler get naked? Is it to sell the movie to girls as well or something cause I really don't see the point.8.2/10",8,29,59,16 October 2009
High Fidelity," Jack Black is overrated
","When I first saw this movie a long time ago I thought it was amazing. But watching it now, it's alright. Still a fun flick about coming in terms with oneself and relationships to a degree but nothing all that amazing. It's a overrated movie with overrated Jack Black. This is probably one of John Cusack's trademark movies and also launched Jack Black to overrated level for a short while. Although John Cusack was perfect for this role. The story is basically about a guy named Rob Gordon(John Cusack) that owns a record store, he critics records and people constantly. But mostly people while also being a hypocrite. He is this conceited, judgmental, critical, hypocritical, selfish jerk. And puts others down when he isn't going anywhere with his own life. In another words a difficult character to like, although some maybe able to relate with the guy. As a matter of fact some audiences actually like this character while admitting the guy is a jerk. Which can be understandable with some other movie characters but not really with this one for me. And during work time he is part of a trio in the record store. with only one of them being likable. Jack Black's character is one of the three trios and I don't know why audiences like this character of his. As this obnoxious, immature, crude and rude guy that works in a record store while forcing his opinions onto others. And he isn't even funny or interesting in my opinion. And this is the character that Jack Black is mostly known for. His character is like Lester Bangs from 'Almost Famous' except annoying. The protagonist Rob Gordon coming in terms and getting over his inner demon aspect is cool and sometimes even interesting at times. While he meets up with his past girlfriends, each with different style and characteristics(Penny Hardwick being my favorite). But it seemed to be missing that flare that leaves something behind and didn't care much about the characters or what happens to them. This movie is just full of characters that are jerks, it's actually humorous and entertaining when they are jerks to each other though. Overall despite few annoying characters, it's still a enjoyable flick and you can tell the actors had fun making this.7.3/10",7,0,0,12 August 2013
Atonement," Maybe I missed something, but I just didn't find this to be all that powerful or moving. It just seemed overdone and over hyped.
","Maybe I need to see this movie again, but I just didn't find the story all that amazing or moving. Well moving sort of, but it isn't a movie I would want to see again. It was boring for the most part and I just didn't find the direction and story all that intriguing, the style and period makes this movie a bit interesting at first. But it starts to get boring bit by bit after a while, not I have seen a bunch of movies like this that goes in a similar direction but some of them was done better. The twist at the end was sort of touching, but that is about it when it comes to the most positive thing I can say about this movie. Maybe I missed something, but I didn't even find this movie to be all that powerful and after it was finished nothing really stuck with me. It just wasn't heart-wrenching although it tries very hard to go in that direction. And sometimes movies like this, after the credits start rolling I think about it later because of the impact of it, but that just wasn't the case for this movie. I wanted to like this movie, but I am not going to force myself to like it either. The cinematography is nice to look at and even beautiful at times though. And it did mash love, war, and human sins in a decent manner. It's basically a overdone and over hyped movie, but the acting in it is very well done.5/10",5,1,1,1 March 2011
V for Vendetta," 'Remember, remember the 5th of November'
","I didn't particularly thought anything of this movie when it first came out because it was difficult to comprehend the story when I was younger. Maybe it was because of the constant sophisticated and fancy words amongst the characters. But not that I can comprehend the movie, I must say this is a amazing movie that I really missed out on in the past. Sure the dialogue comes out like it's written and doesn't seem natural, but than again this takes place in the future. So the plot is this, there is this character V that fights for justice and freedom even if he has to get his hands dirty. And is labeled as a terrorist while he tries rise up against a totalitarian government. Than he meets Evey played by Natalie Portman that is a witness of V's doings. And V has big plans that leads up to the 5th of November. Agent Smith I mean Hugo Weaving was perfect for this role as V, he played it in a very charming and charismatic manner that is believable. This movie simply had style, substance and intelligence thanks to the excellent writing by Alan Moore. Sure the movie has some parts where it isn't fully explained and doesn't make sense sometimes but those are very few and the direction it goes makes it forgivable. The way it tells the story of violence, vengeance and vendetta is done very well although I don't agree with every aspect of this movie. 8.3/10",8,0,3,18 February 2012
Semi-Pro," Semi-retarded
","For a few minutes into it, I thought it was going to be at least better than 'Blades of Glory' but I was wrong. This was just stupid without the humor in it, it seems to try overly hard in order to be funny...But it just isn't. Will Ferrell just acts like a obnoxious idiot that is cocky, in another words it's the same acting he played in many other roles in his past. His past movies were okay, but it seems like they aren't trying any more and just put Will Ferrell in a sports movie thinking he is going to carry the film, but it just doesn't work. And like many of his other roles he does random stuff to be funny, except this time they over do it a lot. First half was okay and than it's just plain boring. Rental at best.4.3/10",4,0,0,17 February 2010
Furious 7," It has it's entertainment value
","Well this was a entertaining flick, but it does get really tiresome. I just really wanted to like this movie, since it's the sendoff movie for Paul Walker. But just got out of the theater feeling like it's just another average high budget action movie. That does have it's entertainment value, but is still easily forgettable. Now this series took a turn for something else starting with 'Fast Five' with it focusing more on the action, missions and carnage over racing. So if I had to rate this movie from 'Fast Five' which is my personal favorite in the franchise so far. I would have to say this is a tie with 'Fast 6' since 6 had better elements when it comes to the directing, the story which is slightly better and more elements actually involving manuerability of the cars. This one has a slight edge when it comes to the entertainment value, so in a way this movie is slightly a guilty pleasure for me. I know they were trying to keep this movie light and fun despite all the carnage, but the humor in this really does flop. Like they were trying to be funny by going overboard but just comes off weak. I personally think Justin Lin is a better director than James Wan. Or maybe that has to do with the fact that Justin Lin stayed on longer with this franchise, anyways I liked the directing style of Lin better. But props to Wan for tackling his first super high budget Hollywood movie. When it comes to this installment, it's like Wan thought up different ways of how many times a car can drive off a high place and how many times people can jump out of a moving vehicle. Since the chase scenes has been done quite a lot in the previous two installments. I personally lost count when it comes to that. However I think Wan also though up fights that the fans would want. Like Jason Statham vs. The Rock, Jason Statham vs. Vin Diesel and Ronda Rousey fighting some other protagonist. The constant pushing in the romance between Dom and Letty just made the movie drag and is probably the most boring part about this movie. Sure it can have a bit o romance, but let's focus on the main plot. Cause the romance in this is stale and far from being immersive. The scene stealer in this is Jason Statham, cause he is by far the most badass villain this franchise has had so far. Which is a shame since it felt like he had less screen time and interactions than Luke Evans. Overall this is a entertaining action movie that is worth a watch, despite it getting really tiresome near the end.6.8/10",6,12,39,10 April 2015
