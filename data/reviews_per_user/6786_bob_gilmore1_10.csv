Frost_Nixon," Not Quite what it could have been
","Watching the previews for Frost/Nixon suggest a film replete with growing tension and excitement, a sort of 'All The President's Men' played out before the TV cameras. In actuality 'Frost/Nixon' is a fairly unimaginative filming of what must have been a great play; at the time Ron Howard plunked down a record amount of money to by the rights. What has made it to the screen is something less than riveting.On the plus side we have Frank Langella, who, having starred in the stage version has the part down pat. Almost a little too pat as he seems to give his performance in a vacuum. While this causes the early scenes in the film to be somewhat void of excitement it does contribute to the undeniable peak of the film, when the interview schedule turns to the Watergate cover-up. Is it worth it? That is a question of individual taste and attention span as the film boils down to what was a fifteen round heavyweight fight. The early rounds are dull indeed, as the fighters probe and spar, searching for weaknesses. The supporting players are strong. Kevin Bacon and Oliver Platt do more than their share, but in the final analysis it comes down to what the the title suggests. Frost/Nixon is not a great film but you could do worse and probably often do at the multiplexes these days.",7,1,5,5 January 2009
3:10 to Yuma," Defines difference between quality & entertainment
","It seems that Russel Crowe has been trying to dig himself out of a hole ever since he threw that telephone at a hotel worker....Alas this remake of a relatively minor film from the 50's is a great example of a film that is extremely well made but lets be honest, not a great deal of fun.Everything about the film is a downer. I don't mean that in a bad way but potential film-goers need to know what they are getting in for. While the cast is uniformly excellent the question that is begged here is why was this film remade? They have lifted whole sections of dialog from Delmer's film and have really done nothing more than add realism to the violence. Sure, it is in color but to what end? Every bit of vibrancy in the image has been drained out as if they wanted to do it in black and white but didn't have the guts.I really wanted to enjoy this movie but found myself checking my watch on more than one occasion particularly in the last half hour. Mangold has made some great films ('Identity' comes to mind even more than 'Walk The Line') but all that he really proves here is that given two of the finest actors working today that he can do as well as Delmer Daves did 50 years ago.",6,3,7,11 September 2007
Deja Vu," Time Travel, Crime Thriller With A heart
","Deja Vu is a top notched policier that effectively bridges the sci-fi cop film romance gap with stinging aplomb. I had my doubts but 20 minutes into this effects filled bonanza I was thoroughly hooked. There is little point in going into the intricacies of the convoluted plot. Reading a description will only make you think, 'That sounds to implausible.' one would utter. Yes there are some inconsistencies. ('Shocked, I am shocked to discover gambling at Ricks!') If you think to hard about it you will, well think to hard about it. Fact is that when you watch it as opposed to reading about it it all seems to make sense. Deja Vu does an incredible job of suspending disbelief, even if you have to swallow twice you will be too entertained to care.The charge leveled against Denzel Washington is that he doesn't make serious pictures. Well that, my friend, is a good thing because his presence transforms countless Hollywood 'product' into endearing fun. Remember 'Out Of Time'? And how about 'The Bone Collector'? Even 'Training Day' was a pretty hackneyed project but the common denominator in all of these films is Denzel. He has done more to make run of the mill studio films bearable than just about any working actor and he doesn't disappoint here giving a great performance and elevating this hokum to near art. Denzel is the 'everyman' that can act his way out of just about any situation, no matter how ridiculous, leaving the audience wanting more.A minor quibble is running length. Hitchcock once noted that a film's running time should not exceed the carrying capacity of a healthy human bladder and this picture stretches it a bit. There really is no need for about 20 minutes, particularly the film's extended conclusion, but who cares? It is a great deal of fun nonetheless.",9,1,4,27 November 2006
Milk," Stunning Biography
","Milk is one of the best films of the year and is a safe bet to make an appearance at this year's Oscar contest with Sean Penn almost locked into the favorite role for Best Actor. The film focuses on the gay rights movement in San Francisco in the 1970's and what could have easily boiled down to tired rhetoric is actually quite uplifting and entertaining.The film's framing device (harvey Milk predicting his own death in a taped interview with himself) is actually a pretty good way to plot out the story line beginning with Milk's arrival in SF and his meeting up with his long time lover (James Franco). The relationship between them is quite accurately observed. Those with an open mind will realize that these are the pitfalls inherent in any long term relationship, gay or straight. Another great performance is delivered by Josh Brolin as Dan White, the council member who finally cracked and whose attorneys came up with the infamous 'twinkie defense'.You don't have to be a liberal activist to enjoy Milk. Penn's performance infuses such humanity in the lead that the picture transcends many of the limitations of the biopic genre and makes for quite rousing entertainment regardless of your preconceptions.",9,1,6,5 January 2009
Dreamgirls," Strongly Cast Musical Strikes sour note
","I was extremely disappointed by Bill Condon's 'Dreamgirls' which is being hyped as one of the year's best pictures. It is not, not even by a long shot.Dreamgirls starts out promising setting up numerous well defined characters and it very effectively places the story in the late 1950's. Period detail is amazing and at about the one hour mark the film looks destined for greatness.Then the cast starts singing.And singing.To make matters worse the songs are atrocious; one wonders if they are intended as camp or satire. If they be satire they go on far too long, if they are supposed to be the real thing then someone has a warped sense of humor or simply don't care that the audiences has to watch on as the film self destructs in the final act.The subject matter could have made a great film. Unfortunately by fictionalizing the account they rob the story of any authenticity. Very strong performances by Eddie Murphy and Jamie Fox simply languish before the entire ensemble cast folds up and dies.Why the film has received such rave notices is beyond me. Perhaps it is the sheer storytelling audacity in presenting a film that grows less realistic with the passage of each scene (Kind of like Olivier's Henry V in reverse)or it may be the fine cast. Most likely it is that these critics don't have an ear for music as these banal songs would be booed off the stage of even American Idol (as one of the actresses apparently was.)That should tell you something.",3,16,31,2 January 2007
Revolutionary Road," Less Than Meets The Eye
","While the film has all of the trappings of Oscar gold including a large marketing campaign, a top shelf cast and Golden Globe nominations it fails the biggest test: Watchability. After an intriguing first half hour the film seems to slip into a predictable pattern and by the end that pattern has worn out its welcome.Director Sam Mendes is no stranger to marital drama. He swept the Oscars with 'American Beauty' a film that made Kevin Spacey a star and was extremely accurate at mining the contradictions of upper middle class domestic bliss. The wild success of 'Desperate Housewives' owes more than a small debt to that film. His follow-up 'Road To Perdition' broadened the scope but at its heart was a study of the family. Turning his focus to a popular and critically acclaimed novel I must say that he falls flat this time despite the efforts of DeCaprio and Winslett, the pair that hold the record for the most successful box office champion of all time.'Road' is set in about the same time period as AMC's critically acclaimed 'Mad Men' and is about a couple approaching their 10th anniversary. They live in a nice house and have two darling kids and are friends with other couples. The film suggests that according to the standards of the current zeitgeist they should be happy and content. But the script suggests that the pair once believed that they were 'special' above the milieu of everyday life. Unforetunately there seems to be very little that is 'special' about them unless you consider the husband's extramarital affairs at work or what would appear to be the increasing erratic behavior of his wife to fall into any ex halted category.At first the aggressive banter between the pair seems jarring and somewhat unique if not totally captivating. But precious little happens in the story and we are left to chew on basically two performers showing us all of their chops and if we can draw anything from the finished product it may be that either Mendes is not that great of a director or maybe that these movie stars are not great movie artists at least not good enough to carry an entire film without any real support. DeCaprio seemed to blow away his detractors with his stunning work in 'The Departed' but in retrospect the kudos may actually belong with Scorsese who helmed that project. I guess that everyone will draw their own conclusion but my guess is that simple deduction would place the blame on the performers.The glowing reviews, award nominations and the cast will most likely bring the public in to see the film but my guess is that this Road will end up being less traveled than others.",5,6,12,2 January 2009
The Departed," The Best So Far For 2006
","My first thoughts walking out of the theater were, 'wow that was great but it wasn't as good as Goodfellas.' Few living directors have such built in levels of expectations as Martin Scorsese; his past will always be difficult to live down but he mostly does an amazing job with his all-star cast in The Departed. Given access to Hollywood's greatest talent allows him to create a vividly interesting and intensely watchable crime film. Everyone will have their favorites but for my money Alec Baldwin in the most consistently entertaining even with limited screen time.The film is long, but doesn't seem long. If you are weighing the film from an investment standpoint I doubt that there are many places that you can go for two and a half hours and be this enthralled for only about eight bucks.Back to The Goodfellas comparison. One of the reasons that that film had such a visceral appeal was that Ray Liotta was pretty much an unknown at the time. We got to know Liotta as Henry Hill, we didn't have many previous roles to work through in our establishing empathy. Sure he played in Field Of Dreams, but it was a brief appearance. In The Departed we never feel the same level of cathartic involvement because the actors are still just actors.In the end this is but a minor quibble as the action is so riveting, the performances so well presented and the story so engaging that it doesn't matter much that we don't have that same level of emotional involvement.Oscar time for Marty? Who knows. Most thought that the breakthrough would come with The Aviator (A great historical-visual masterpiece) but it was not the case. If the opening weekend means anything this will be probably be the director's most successful box office creation. Maybe that has been the real barrier to Scorsese getting over the top. While the violence is certainly ever present it seems to be less violent of a film than Taxi Driver or Goodfellas because of the way the violence is presented on the screen. It just sort of happens and it's happening just fits into the way that the plot unfolds.",10,2,4,9 October 2006
The Reader," Multi-layered emotional triumph
","The Reader is a real rarity in movies today; an emotional film that resists a simple explanation. If you like your movies all neatly wrapped up for emotional consumption, 'The Reader' is not for you. Our story begins in 1995 as our hero, Ralph Fiennes comments about his daughter's impending visit. We are soon transported back to 1958 as our character is seen as a young teenager getting violently ill in the rain. He is assisted by a woman who takes him to her apartment and before a whole lot has transpired they have begun a sexual affair, an affair that both parties keep secret. We move forward eight years hence when our hero is a young law student witnessing the war crimes trial of several minor SS guards. The woman that taught him about sexual love is one of the women in the dock.As difficult as it is to sum up in under 100 words what this film is about, it is just as rewarding to the patient viewer. It covers a wide range of issues and has something important to say about a wide range of subjects, from The Holocaust to adult literacy. From lustful sex to repressed memories. Kate Winslet is absolutely stunning as a woman who ages forty years before our eyes. Every performance rings true to some extent and that is no easy task given the depth of the lead. 'The Reader' is a film that will reward the patient viewer with one of the best paced and developed stories of the year.",9,2,3,9 February 2009
Moon," Sci Fi film on fast track to classic status
",With just two weeks to go on a three year hitch mining minerals on the moon an isolated man (Sam) awaits a return to earth and his wife and young daughter. Spare and stripped down to the essence of the central conflict (Man vs. technology) Moon shows a heavy 2001 influence but the Sean Connery film 'Outland' is a precursor as well as the film introduces corporate greed into the equation. The story involves Sam talking to 'gertie' a computer voiced by Kevin Spacey. Gertie pretty much calls the shots but what really gets Sam confused is when he awakens in the infirmary to find a carbon copy of himself going about duties on the station. He is exactly the same as Sam except he appears to have just started his tour of duty. Is one of them a clone? Is Sam still alive? Is this a dream? Moon asks a lot from the viewer in terms of paying attention but for those who stick with this acting tour de force will be richly rewarded by a conclusion that makes more sense the more that you think about it.,10,1,2,15 July 2009
The Pursuit of Happyness," Rocky Meets Kramer Vs Kramer meets Wall Street (with a heart)
","From the opening shots of urban San Francisco poverty to the taxi cab with the ad for 'Raging Bull' plainly displayed, 'Happyness' weaves an accurate heart wrenching tale of the the triumph of the individual, the triumph of sticking to one's goals despite overwhelming odds.There are so many poignant scenes in this film that ring true in incredibly insightful ways for anyone that has 'been there' The look in the eyes of the protagonist's wife as he explains how things 'will get better' financially cuts like a knife for any man who has had the same conversation with his wife or girlfriend. You can tell that she stopped believing long ago and only now are her emotions matching her outward display toward her husband. Will Smith is terrific cast against type as a hard working down and out Medical Equipment salesman who one day sees a stock broker pull up in the fanciest of cars. At that moment he knows what he wants to be and the barriers before him will be conquered, one way or another.Many critics on the left have attacked this film. The fact that Will Smith is an outspoken Republican and that the film places financial success as the ultimate form of human achievement (that and being a good Dad)may rub them the wrong way. It shouldn't. There is nothing overtly political about this film and it really shouldn't be missed for any reason. It looks like the Best Actor category is crowded this year but it would take a miracle for Will Smith not to get nominated. Some may carp that the supporting performances are nothing special but that is because there really are no supporting performances. No other Actor gets great lines to work with but they all acquit themselves just fine. The real co-star is the city by the bay which looks alternatively beautiful and frightening. Given what it costs just to live in San Francisco it would probably be the worst city to be poor in. Overall this is a very fine film, a film that is perfect family viewing, especially for kids who may not be getting as many Christmas presents this year as they thought they should.",9,1,3,18 December 2006
