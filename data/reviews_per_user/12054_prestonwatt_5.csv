The New World," About The New World
","I watched this movie because of a History Through Film class. In this movie, the filmmaker is telling the story of Pocahontas and John Smith. It shows us how they met and how they went about their journey. I noticed that because this film was made in 2005, there were not much special effects. I also noticed that the technology used was not as high tech as movies are now. This movie made me question its historical accuracy because the English accent was not the same as it was in the past. Also, Pocahontas's age in the movie is portrayed to be older when in reality she was only 10. This movie reminded me of Hunger Games because of the way the filmmaker cut to scenes of nature. I liked how the filmmaker let the actors do their own thing in the movie. It makes the movie more authentic. I also liked how John Smith was Portrayed as a quiet hero because it brings a sense of mystery. One thing I didn't like was the fact John didn't fight very hard to be with Pocahontas. Overall, I think the movie is ok, but not very action packed. It was a little hard to sit through without dozing off. I would watch other movies by this director because I like the nature scenes. It was certainly an interesting movie.",5,1,1,30 August 2018
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid
","I watched this movie as part of a History Through Film class. I like this movie because it shows the crazy and adventurous spirit of cowboys. It also shows romance that we may think is unhealthy but is what helps the cowboys get through their tough times. I didn't like how everyone was against Butch Cassidy and Sundance kid. Even though they are criminals. The historical accuracy is good because many cowboys were like pirates but on land. It is nice to see the point of view from criminals so you can understand them. Overall, this movie is good because it had lots of action and never rested.",Null,1,3,9 November 2018
The Alamo," About The Alamo
","I watched this movie as part of a History through film class. A group of Texan's were determined to protect the Alamo from the Spanish. Many battles were taken place in order for them to win this war. This movie was made in 2004 so the graphics were not terrible. It makes the movie easier to understand when they remake an old movie. I like how they showed blood because it made it more fun and realistic. I also liked how it showed the cultural differences between the Texan's and the Spanish. I didn't like the way they filmed the gun shots because they looked super fake. Overall, this movie was really good for educational purposes but not the most fun to watch. But forever remember the Alamo.",6,0,2,11 October 2018
Wonder Woman," Wonder Women Review
","I like this movie because it involves many emotions. This movie goes from happy to sad and loving to anger. The historical accuracy is pretty accurate beside the fact Wonder Women has powers and all the Greek Gods and such. I like how this movie has characters who all have a different view point, and Diana learns about all of them. In the end, she says, ' Now I know, only love can save the world.' She fights for what she believes in and what is good. Overall, this movie is excellent and I recommend it.",10,1,1,15 November 2018
Cinderella Man," Review for Cinderella Man
","Cinderella Man is a really good movie that shows you the struggles of the Great Depression. It also shows you a family who is fighting to survive and a man who fights even the toughest of challenges. The man, Jim, is a boxer who broke his hand and still fights. I like how he said he fought for milk. This symbolizes that he fights to provide for his family. I also like the characters accents. I didn't like the amount of talking there was. But, the historical accuracy is very on point. Overall, this is a very good movie to motivate you to fight for what you want.",7,0,0,4 December 2018
