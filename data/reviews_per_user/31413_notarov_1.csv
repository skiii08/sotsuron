Vertigo," A masterpiece of twists, turns and skewed gender representation!
","Never before has a director so masterfully rotated gender politics in classic Hollywood cinema - but we have come to expect nothing less from Hitchcock, the master of ingenuity, and the master of suspense. An original, enticing and fascinating piece of work, this film has everything. A tale of mystery and obsession with a shocking twist, a skewed sense of reality, and fabulous acting set amongst garish Technicolor and jarring mdse-en-scene, 'Vertigo' is ultimately unmissable. What makes this film so special though, is its appeal to human emotions. Freud himself could not have written a film that raises so many psychoanalytic questions - and doesn't even begin to answer them. 'Vertigo' is a film which others must be held up against. 10/10.",10,5,7,7 February 2005
