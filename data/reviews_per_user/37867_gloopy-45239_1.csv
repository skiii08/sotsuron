","I guess this title, goes to prove, how everyone has different tastes, for me this is nothing special at all, stay clear.Way too long for what it is and really not that entertaining, acting is very average, personally if any of my friends asks me about this, i would be pointing them towards another title, any title.",4,1,2,13 September 2018
