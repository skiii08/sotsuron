Howl's Moving Castle," Nice picture, weak storyline
","OK here's another Miyazaki's film. As always, its graphics are nice, and its feel is dream-like. I admire Miyazaki's imagination a lot (I haven't read the original novel of this movie).However, the movie doesn't impress me a lot because of several reasons:***spoilers ahead*** 1, You can always see something familiar from it. Well maybe it's Miyazaki or Gibli's trademark, but when I see characters flying, war, a request to stop the war, etc. etc., I begin to feel a bit disappointed. I'm not saying that Howl's not creative enough, but I was expecting something more creative and original, like Spirited Away.2, Some ideas are quite vague. For instance, why Howl is always flying around the dangerous war scene, while doing nothing at all but getting tired and hurt? Maybe I'm slow, but I didn't see a point for him doing so. Another example, why that return-to-the-past door suddenly appears in front of Sophie? What's its function besides letting Sophie know Howl's past? To me, this part is not really necessary. Even it's a imaginary world, it still need some logic right?3, The ending is quite predictable. Well, happy ending. But I can't figure out why the war suddenly ends. They fight so hard, for so long time, the Queen even sends out fluid strange people to gather soldiers, and all of sudden, she agrees to stop the war? It doesn't make a clear sense to me. And the cursed-prince-return-to-human-form part looks a bit stupid and abrupt. I'm not saying the ending is disappointing 'cos it's still a good and happy ending, the story deserves it, but...oh well.***Spoilers End*** So, yeah that's roughly about it. I still appreciate all the work and effort, and the movie itself is really nice.6/10, for the nice wonderful word Miyazaki delivers.",6,8,15,21 February 2005
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," so-so, quite forgettable
","I've been waiting for this one. But then, it turned out to be another Shrek 3 - ruining a good film with sequels.In this film, the four friends are separated, each of them having their own storyline. I'm fine with this treatment. But while some of the plots are slightly better, some are quite predictable and boring. Unlike Shrek 1 which is full of unexpected twists and pleasant surprises, for this one I was like 'I know xxxx is going to redeem his pride', 'I know xxxx will be together with xxxx', etc. And I guessed right all the time.To me, Dreamwork excels in crispy, modern and clever jokes. Even if the characters show the emotional side, they show it in a stylish and funny way. So that's why I had most problems with the main storyline - ***SPOILER*** the scene when 'Mufasa' breathlessly chasing the truck that took 'Simba', or when the lion king family happily got together after the long separation, or when 'Scar' succeeded in his evil plans. ***END OF SPOILER*** If these scenes are meant to be moving, they're not dramatic enough; if they're meant to be comedy-like, they're not funny enough. Maybe the intention was to achieve both, but it kept making me confused because I didn't know whether to laugh at the characters or feel for them. I mean, why do they even imitate The Lion King? That film was doing extremely well on the emotion side, and if Dreamwork wants to do a better job, they should just stick to what they're good at.Another thing I don't like is the violence. I don't mind violence being shown in a cartoon style - the bird being blown up by Fiona's singing in Shrek 1 was quite brute, but I enjoyed it. ***SPOILER*** However in Madagascar 2, when the main characters let the car run over the old lady, or Alex and the old lady slapping each other and Alex even broke a tooth (man, that sure hurts!), I don't see anything funny about it. I feel it's wrong. And... am I the only one who feels sorry for the shark dying that way? ***END OF SPOILER*** I enjoyed the penguins. But I feel it's not good when you love the supporting characters more than the main ones. It's like ice age 2 - I was just waiting for the squirrel to appear for his 10 seconds show every time.All in all, I only laughed no more than 5 times throughout the whole show. There are good jokes, yes; it's enjoyable, yes; but it still seems like Dreamwork's ideas are running out. It has absolutely no chance to compete with Wall-E for the Oscars. I do hope there's no Madagascar 3.",4,4,13,15 November 2008
