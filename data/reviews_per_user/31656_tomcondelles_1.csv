Catch Me If You Can," I absolutely loved this movie.
","CATCH ME IF YOU CAN is one of my favorite Spielberg films, I found it to be absolutely intriguing to watch and have seen it three times. My other favorite Spielberg films include THE COLOR PURPLE, 1941, JAWS and MUNICH, which was recently overlooked at he Oscars. I have written to Steven Spielberg and I am trying to find out how I can work in one of his films as a supporting actor or possibly meet him in Los Angeles. I think about Steven often and he is one of my Hollywood idols. He doesn't usually answer my letters to him at Universal. If anyone out there knows how I can reach him email me at TOMCONDELLES@YAHOO.COM, it has been a lifelong obsession of mine to work in Hollywood.",10,2,4,16 May 2006
