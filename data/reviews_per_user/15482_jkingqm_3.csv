Requiem for a Dream," 'OMG' is my review... Can be analyzed in so many ways....
","This is the most powerful film I have ever seen.  Although just an 'arthouse drama' it won a British award for best horror film.  OMG where shall I start...If you want to study 'pacing' of a movie study this one.  A comment after showing this to some friends was 'the repetitive pictures of the eyeballs, etc. was annoying.'  Well that's where the 2000+ cuts of the movie came from!  lolI believe that those repetitive cuts form a 'reference point' in the movie. Throughout the movie we see that reference point. Between that reference point we see four lives spiralling into hell.  Repeatedly when consequences of the character's own actions seem to have bottomed out, they get worse. Each consequential situation more horrific, both emotionally and graphically at the same time.  This film is a study of character development because every decision and action of each is never surprising.  Never does anyone do anything out of character that surprises. What surprises are the consequences of each happening graphicaly and in parallel on the screen. Sara Goldfarb is another reference point in the film. Sarah was portrayed by Ellen Burstyn, the mom in 'The Exorcist', nominated for 'Best Actress in a Leading Role' Oscar for this movie]. Surely things cannot keep getting worse for Sara Goldfarb, the sad-sack mother of Jerod Leto's character Harry Goldfarb in this film, but they do. to be continued...",Null,0,1,5 July 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," All I could say was 'Wow'
","From the opening scene you can tell that the sets, cinematography, lighting, etc. are going to be stunning.  I can't imagine seeing this picture on video on the small screen.  If you don't think you can handle the subtitles don't worry.  After the first few moments I didn't even notice they were speaking Chinese (or whatever). I can't believe I just saw a movie with martial arts that wasn't stupid!  And not one bit of overacting!True, you can consider it 'slow moving' as someone has said, but the story line (a love story and more) is broken up with incredible martial arts fight scenes.  When I first saw them skip-flying over the rooftops I thought for a second it was kind of silly, but quickly I was silently saying 'wow' to myself over and over.  It puts 'The Matrix' to shame in that respect.It's not a martial arts film, so if that's what you want then it's not for you.  You might get bored waiting between the rest of the film for those scenes.  It is a movie worthy of an Oscar because, besides it's incredible production values, the story line includes the grand themes that make up a great film, namely love, honor, loyalty, hate, revenge, and betrayal.",Null,0,0,17 February 2001
The Sixth Sense," I didn't have a clue
","I didn't see this until way after it came out on video.  How I managed to not have heard what the twist ending was I don't know.  We didn't have a clue about the ending.  The video has a little five minute chat with the director, etc. and they tell how they do give you clues etc. throughout the film, so we watched it a second time immediately to see.  The film is brilliant.  I don't like Bruce Willis but he was great.  One ghost in particular freaked me out (the kid with his head blown off).",10,0,0,1 September 2000
