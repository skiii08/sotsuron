The Lobster," Liked by the critics
","I understand why a lot of people had problems with this film, and why, for the most part, the critics did not. Personally, I loved it. As a film student, I'm used to putting my 'critic-head' on, but I get that 'The Lobster's bizarreness and unfamiliarity might make some viewers lose interest. I won't lie, its quite a rough watch.One thing I do wish to comment on is the ending, so if you haven't seen this film yet, stop reading now. So at the end, we are left with a blind Rachel Weisz sitting alone in a cafe, and a short-sighted Colin Farrell with a knife to his face in the next room, ready to blind himself (we assume this is the plan he describes to Weisz in their secret code). The screen cuts to black and we are given the cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers. Farrell himself said there were three possible outcomes:1. David blinds himself and the two live on as a couple.
2. David runs away, leaving a handicapped Rachel Weisz abandoned.
3. David pretends he has blinded himself for the rest of the couple's lives, but in reality, keeps his sight.When watching, I originally assumed he would pick the last option, and we would see him saunter back to his seat, maybe knocking over a glass on the way to make it seem more believable. But as soon as the screen went black, I changed my mind. My instant thought was that the jarring cut was representative of the moment David stabbed himself in the eye, and the film ends here as there is nothing left to see. Whatever the ending is supposed to be, I liked it.Although we know that this is where it ends, earlier in the film, I assumed there would be a different ending. When he uses code to tell Weisz his plan, I assumed he was planning to return to the hotel to transform into a guide dog for her. This is for a few reasons. Firstly, the leader of the single people told her to find herself a guide dog. Also, David's brother was a dog, showing the people are possibly still self-aware after turning into animals. At the start of the film, the hotel manager (Olivia Colman) praises David's choice of a lobster because most people think of 'dog' which is apparently a bad choice?? This is the main reason why I thought he would transform, as it would suggest he had overcome the selfishness of this new regime, and made a decision purely based on love. His actual decision (to blind himself) was only made to fit into the idea that you must have something in common with your partner (short-sightedness, nose bleeds etc.), giving the film a very disturbing and unsettling ending to force you into contemplating modern relationship expectations.These are just some thoughts I had while watching. Let me know what you think. :)",9,5,10,8 January 2019
The Favourite," Many people missed the point.
","I could talk for hours on the sheer brilliance that is Olivia Colman. She is one of the strongest actors of all time, and does not get the recognition she deserves. Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone are also unbelievably talented. I loved the film; I'd say it was the best picture of 2018. From reading reviews, I can see a lot of people are critiquing the ending, but I think it was really quite effective. (Bare in mind, this is simply my interpretation of the ending, it is not necessarily what Lanthimos was aiming for)So in the final scenes, we see Sarah leave, and Abigail become Anne's new lover. The final shot is three superimposed clips; one of Anne, one of Abigail rubbing her legs and one of the rabbits. It's rather long and honestly quite disturbing. So, to break it down, we must look at the previous sequence. Abigail is living in luxury, attending outrageous parties and spending time with every man other than her husband. It's clear she never loved the queen; she only pretended to in order to increase her status. Queen Anne replaced her true love (Sarah) with Abigail, someone who would apparently do anything for the queen's satisfaction, without asking for anything in return. In short, the queen chose the wrong girl; Sarah gave her tough but true love while Abigail faked it the whole time.Abigail succeeds in regaining her status, but as we see in the final shot, is still merely a slave to the Queen's needs and pleasures. Abigail is stuck in this role, while Anne is stuck with Abigail a woman she knows deep down does not truly love her as Sarah did.The layering of the women's faces reveals they are bound for a meaningless life of dissatisfaction and falsity. The Rabbits, a representation of Anne's 17 dead children, echo Sarah's replacement with Abigail. The rabbits unsuccessfully fill the hole created by the deaths of the children, while Abigail does the same to the hole created by Sarah's dismissal. The layering of the shots suggest Abigail is just as special to the queen as one of the rabbits and holds no real power in the palace.",10,10,20,14 January 2019
