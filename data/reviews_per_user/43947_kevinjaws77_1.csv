The Blair Witch Project," Staring Three Idiots
","I have seen this movie, ''I have to tell you'I thought the plot for this film was outstanding. A lot of viewers were upset about the fact that the killer witch was never shown. I personally think that sometimes things are best unseen or unsaid. That is why I think this film would of been a very decent scary horror film if the movie was just filmed regularly. Instead of three Idiots just filming their way through deep into a woods, and actually pretending they got lost, and killed one by one by a witch, making the viewers believe the footage was real and they were really missing, never seen again. The part that made me laugh was a scene in that movie when they were supposedly lost, You could see a gap into the trees witch lead to a visible road. The plot had the right idea. The acting would of made it by. The filming was just pathetic.",1,1,4,22 October 2006
