The Ring," Adds up to zero
","I'm a horror-movie fan, but this one left me feeling cheated out of the hour and a half it wasted.  The characters are unappealing (the heroine, for example, is supposed to be the mother of a young son, but you never for a second feel that she cares about him), and the plot -- creepy rather than scary -- is ultimately inexplicable, adding up to zero.  The only thing worth praising is the rather artistic photography.",Null,0,1,12 June 2003
The Babadook," 2014's two most annoying characters
","I really should stop taking Joseph Morgenstern (the Wall Street Journal's elderly movie critic) seriously. It's clear he tends to overpraise 'little' films, low-budget films, especially when, as in this case, he's inexplicably smitten with the lead actress. He certainly steered me wrong on this one.Essie Davis, the actress in question, has had a pretty impressive career during which she's played everything from a farm wife to a flapper detective, but here she turns in a really irritating, relentlessly one-note performance -- at least for the first half of the film. (In the second half, she turns in an only-slightly-less-irritating performance on a different single note; see below.) As a widow saddled with a particularly uncute, neurotic,perpetually nagging seven-year-old son, Davis keeps her face frozen ina single expression, that of a Brave Little Martyr who's barely coping with the awfulness of her life; with her heavy-lidded eyes and (so it seems) lack of makeup, she always looks as if she's either about to cry or has just finished crying. In every scene -- I mean absolutely every friggin' scene -- she has loose, unkempt strands of hair hanging off the side of her face and a wisp or two over her eyes; you want to yell, 'For Chrissake, comb your hair! Pull your damned hair out of your eyes!' Clearly that's the director's way of never letting you forget, even for a second, that Davis is supposed to be a Frazzled Woman at the End of Her Tether.She and her son -- did I mention that he's really annoying? (even Joseph Morgenstern thought so) -- live in a creepy, shadow-filled old house that seems much too large for the two of them, with sinister long dark corridors, an imposing staircase, doors that open on their own, and electricity that's always mysteriously going off, plunging the place in darkness. At night, needless to say, the house makes all the usual creepy-old-haunted-house noises. It also contains the requisite Scary Basement. I feel as if I've seen this creepy old house or its equivalent way too many times before -- in a million horror movies, in fact, dating from the early talkies right up to 'The Conjuring.' What's more, at various dramatic points in the film, plaster walls split -- sound familiar? -- and at one point the mother peels back some wallpaper and large black beetles come crawling out. This last phenomenon, though, may be Only in Her Head. (Apparently there are people, judging from some of the comments I've seen on this site, who actually think it's a brilliantly original notion to maintain some ambiguity as to whether a horror tale's events have a supernatural or a psychological explanation. Sorry, folks, that's old hat.) Another ancient rule that this film scrupulously follows is that, despite all the creepy things that go on in the house, the characters continue to live there.And then there's the book, the nasty, somewhat Edward Gory-ish illustrated children's pop-up book that gives the movie its title and its maybe-real, maybe-imaginary, never-quite-glimpsed monster. The book itself (nicely designed, incidentally, by a heavy-duty far-left feminist of uncertain gender named Alexandra 'Alex' Juhasz) is an exceedingly clever creation, right down to the old-fashioned-looking lettering (or font?) of the text. But the fact that this evil volume proves infallibly prophetic (the Babadook knocks three times, etc., just as the book warns), and the way it keeps reappearing, even after it's thrown away and later torn to pieces, is just ho-hum predictable.So is the fact that the family dog ends up dead -- a plot point that's thuddingly obvious from the moment we first spy the animal, even before we see the dog killed in the book. It's practically a requirement of the genre.(But speaking of this book, it's rather puzzling: I don't recall the mother ever looking at the title page to see who the author is, or even if any author is listed. Which is it supposed to be, a one-of-a-kind handmade item or an actual published children's book? You'd think a modern-day mother might do something as prosaic as looking it up on the Internet.) An additional genre cliché: the way the people in the movie who'd normally be expected to provide help -- like the (caricatured) police, (caricatured) social workers, and to some extent a psychiatrist and the woman's own sister -- prove to be callous, stiff, dense, unsympathetic, and generally unhelpful.But then, who in his right mind would want to hang around with that mother and son anyway? I began to find them tedious -- the yammering, neurotic, demanding kid and his long-suffering, put-upon mother -- within the first ten minutes. So I was relieved when, in the second half of the movie, she finally cracked up and was transformed into a raving madwoman, Murderous Mom, stalking around the house with a carving knife in time-honored horror-movie fashion. At least, in this mode, she seemed less weak and insipid.Still, this reverse one-note performance soon began to grate; the mother (the boy, too, come to think of it) simply spent too much time yelling and screaming. (One of the commenters on this site complained that all that hollering gave him a headache. I know what he meant.) Really, the sort of thing that deserves our applause is the rare horror movie that manages to generate fear softly and quietly.P.S. I noticed that 'Babadook' publicity quotes a highly laudatory tweet from 'Exorcist' director William Friedkin. Frankly, I'm mystified that the creator of several bona fide classics could praise so joyless and derivative a film. Perhaps, like Morgenstern and other critics, Friedkin is inclined to be overly generous to low-budget indies. Maybe he's gone a bit senile. Or maybe he relished this film's occasional over-the-top 'Exorcist'-type moments, including a gravity-defying bed and something vaguely reminiscent of the earlier film's vomiting scene.",4,20,48,5 December 2014
Hugo," Picturesque but surprisingly dreary
","Something unfortunate happens when directors decide to celebrate their love of the cinema. They end up celebrating themselves and their own fannish sensibilities, and their movies turn all mawkish. That's what happened in Truffaut's smug DAY FOR NIGHT and Tornatore's treacly CINEMA PARADISO, and it's what happens here. Ostensibly an expression of Scorsese's infatuation with film, it's really an example of his self-infatuation. HUGO is undeniably beautiful to look at, with sumptuous atmospheric sets and elaborate shots from high overhead or down long corridors -- trust me, miles and miles of corridors -- expressly designed to make maximum use the 3-D camera. But the story itself is glum and painfully slow. Around me audience members kept yawning, and they stirred restlessly in their seats whenever a character launched into another interminable nostalgic reminiscence. (I felt especially sorry for the kids, for whom the film had to be a letdown.) Too many scenes are as earnest and didactic as a museum lecture on the early history of cinema.Although HUGO's got a splendid cast, the characters struck me as formulaic and lifeless; it's like watching one of those motion-capture Bob Zemeckis movies, such as THE POLAR EXPRESS or A Christmas CAROL, populated by figures not entirely human who resemble animated Chris Van Allsburg illustrations. (The film's very distinctive look is in fact pure Van Allsburg -- a mixed blessing. Everything we see is gorgeous, but it all looks fake, like the expensive film set it is. Eventually the artificiality grows tiresome.) I've always loved Georges Melies's wonderful silent fantasies, and it's commendable that Scorsese is reminding modern audiences, via this movie, just how inventive, magical, and ahead-of-their-time they were. But somehow the sheer self-congratulatory reverence that Scorsese lavishes on those old films made me long for a simple unpretentious documentary.",4,16,33,23 November 2011
Children of Men," News flash: Today's gelded Brits turned into trite fascist thugs!
","It's kind of ironic. At a time when Great Britain appears to be declining into terminal wimpiness -- multiculturalism the orthodoxy of the day; swatches of London turned into Londonistan; Britain's military cut in half; her once-great navy reduced to coastal patrol; her sailors groveling with self-abasement before their Iranian captors, then attempting to sell their stories to the tabloids; her prince kept home from the war lest he be kidnapped; in short, a nation of pacifists, appeasers, and peace marchers -- the makers of 'Children of Men' have concocted a leftie's dystopia in which today's soft-headed nanny state has improbably morphed into a nation of ruthless fascists who hunt down dissidents and cage, torture, and murder innocent asylum seekers. 'Children' celebrates the trite old radical mind-set that sustained us in the '60s: the government is evil, off the pigs, open the borders, we're brave members of the underground, a cadre of romantic revolutionaries, blah blah blah... It's the sort of self-pitying fantasy that must warm the hearts of Guardian and Independent readers everywhere as they search their papers for signs of police brutality they can tsk-tsk over.",2,3,10,17 May 2007
Black Hawk Down," What puzzles me the most...
","I was thrilled by this film in the theater when it first came out, and I've subsequently watched it, or sections of it, dozens of times at home. Each time, I admire its brilliant direction, editing, sound, music, the rhythm of the action, and the sheer beauty of many of the shots. Ridley Scott has made some classic films and (more recently) some disappointing ones. This, I think, is his best.But it's definitely confusing as hell, and even after all these viewings -- even after having read Mark Bowden's book (which the film follows very closely) -- I have trouble keeping track of all the various characters: the Deltas, the Rangers, and their complicated movements around war-torn Mogadishu.Most confusing of all -- something that puzzles me each time I see the film (and which the book fails to clear up) -- is why this poorly planned military operation was ever okayed in the first place. As depicted on screen, it seems the most harebrained scheme imaginable, because it's so ridiculously vulnerable, just one tiny step away from utter failure.All it takes to screw up the mission is a lone RPG fired at one of the low-flying helicopters. And hovering in the air just above the rooftops, the choppers make the easiest of targets; a single strike with a rocket can bring one down, and when one goes down (followed shortly afterward, of course, by a second), the entire mission turns into a colossal disaster.Sam Shepard, playing the general in charge, is, as always, an impressive figure, but you want to shout at him, 'You idiot! What were you thinking?'",10,7,11,31 August 2017
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," One silly little idea, done to death
","Talk about running an idea into the ground! This film takes one somewhat trite sci-fi idea spawned during the pulp era -- a helmet-like machine that can be fitted over the head to erase selected memories -- and lets us watch it work on two quirky, unhappy lovers... and that's about it. Way too much of the movie involves the flashily filmed fragmentary memories, dreams, half-memories, fantasies, etc. etc. experienced by the Jim Carrey character as he undergoes this improbable procedure (which proves the excuse for a number of special effects). Watching such fragments, on and on, is about as tedious as listening to someone recount his dream. I've seen three films so far written by Charles Kaufman, and the only one I've enjoyed was 'Adaptation.' This one -- like 'Being John Malkovich' -- began to bore and annoy me before it was halfway through.",4,4,10,3 May 2005
Grindhouse," Leave after the trailers
","The two movies-within-the-movie simply do not work together. The first film, the Rodriguez 'Planet Terror,' is terrific lively fun, and the action never lets up. It's the sort of thing a grindhouse director might actually have made if he'd had a bigger budget and a lot more talent than most of his peers. The trailers midway through are extremely funny and maintain just the right grindhouse tone. But the Tarantino film that follows is a dreadful, talky-talky-talky bore, a true endurance test that just goes on and on and on like some kind of Andy Kaufman stunt... until finally you get a few minutes of automobile collisions. The group of 'heroines' are downright repulsive, unattractive, and masculine, and the theme of butch women beating the crap out of an evil male is -- well, more a product of Tarantino's personal fantasies, I think, than of the true grindhouse world.",4,1,3,18 May 2007
War of the Worlds," Feel-bad movie of the summer!
","Spielberg! Tom Cruise!! A tried-and-true sci-fi classic by H. G. Wells!!! Together they should add up to a great summer popcorn movie, but here's how to squander a golden opportunity by making all the wrong choices: Make sure there isn't a single sympathetic human character in the entire film, so that we'll be sure to root for the Martians (or whatever they are). Make your central family so quarrelsome, incurious, irrational, and just plain annoying that we long to escape from their company -- and then force us to spend the entire movie seeing all the events through their eyes. Let Tom Cruise bicker with his teenage son in a tedious sitcom way while civilization is crumbling around them and hundreds of people are being vaporized. Encourage Dakota Fanning to scream, scream, scream throughout the entire film so that we can savor the joy of having a little kid screaming shrilly in our ears. Take a heart-meltingly beautiful actress like Miranda Otto and make her pregnant so that she looks pudgy and matronly -- and since she's the Mother Figure, don't give her anything interesting to do. Have human beings -- who might be expected to scatter and flee at giant killer tripods -- crowd together and gaze up at these lethal 200-foot-tall machines with a dumb awestruck wonder approaching zombiehood (even a herd of sheep would display more survival skills). In particular, at the first sight of the first alien war machine thrusting up from the pavement somewhere in Queens, NY, have your multiethnic crowds assemble around the widening hole just inches from the edge and peer inside, even as the sidewalk begins to crack and buildings around them fall to pieces. Give the hero a Quest, a Goal, that's really dumb and just this side of pointless -- in this case, somehow getting himself and his two kids from NYC to Boston, where his ex-wife is -- but don't reveal how he manages, improbably, to get there, and don't let us know why he assumes she (or anyone in Boston, for that matter) would still be alive. Don't give any other human beings any direction or motivation at all, but instead just show them shuffling like refugees down roads, bound God knows where, or fleeing together in a panic -- for no logical reason -- onto a ferry boat which has no chance of getting away and no particular safe place to go. Wherever humans are, have them congregate in groups so that the lethal tripods can pick them off and slaughter them more easily. Have the motivation and intentions of the aliens themselves remain thoroughly obscure: At first, when they presumably want to rid the earth of mankind, don't have them use poison gas (as I seem to recall Wells did), but instead let them content themselves with firing death rays, like target practice, at individual fleeing humans -- the most inefficient method of extermination imaginable. Then, midway through, suggest that -- for no particular reason -- the aliens are vampires who seek human blood. When all of metropolitan New York, or perhaps the whole East Coast, is plunged in a blackout, have the hero and his family reach an unnamed suburb at nighttime where, miraculously, the one house they're seeking is flooded with light: the only house on the street, standing empty but with every light inexplicably burning (and no other humans around to investigate). Have the hero be a derrick operator and presumably something of a technical expert, but don't use any of his expertise during the course of the story. While the eponymous War is raging, don't use the benefits of modern computer graphics to show us what's interesting (such as a battle between the Air Force and the aliens); keep the action for what seems a quarter of the film confined to a couple of basements, so that, claustrophobically, we feel as if we're watching a low-budget three-person stage play with all the action going on -- unseen -- outside the windows. Whenever possible show humans screaming, despairing, panicking, and fighting among themselves -- never cooperating or displaying any ingenuity. Take the one potentially interesting, sympathetic character (Tim Robbins), the one character who has a dream, however crackbrained, of resistance to the invaders, and quickly turn him into a loony that will engage Cruise in a fight to the death. When, in the time-tested Spielberg manner, you have the Family Reunited At The End, stage the scene in such a hokey, amateurish, improbable way that the audience around me laughed derisively.",4,420,668,28 June 2005
RED," Truly a movie for morons
","I know it's unforgivable and lazy and pathetically juvenile to pretend to criticize a motion picture merely by heaping scorn and abuse on the people who liked it -- that sort of ad hominem argument is quite correctly dismissed by all right-thinking people -- but dammit, I can't help it, it's a moral certainty, a non-negotiable fact, it's something that just keeps bubbling to the surface and will not be gainsaid, an indisputable truth that admits of no argument, a truth that I am now going to tell you in plain, simple language: 'Red' is a movie only a moron could like. Period. If you found this witless excrescence funny or endearing or entertaining, it ipso facto is proof that you are a moron and have no taste, and all your opinions are worthless. You may have done well on your SATs; you may have graduated from a top college and done splendidly at grad school. You may be successful at an extremely demanding job. You may be good at crossword puzzles; you may have solved Rubik's Cube. 'Red' made you chuckle? You got a kick out of Bruce Willis, and Malkovich, and Parker, and Freeman? You, my friend, are a moron, and I have no use for you.",2,8,17,6 August 2013
Heat," In the end, pretty underwhelming
","HEAT has, of course, a terrific cast, but this sprawling, rambling, overlong, ultimately anticlimactic film is marred throughout by one of the more irritating clichés of cop dramas: the boring domestic scene in which the wife (or girlfriend) of the cop (or criminal) complains about how unfulfilled she is, the uncertainty of their relationship, how little she sees him, blah blah blah. In this one, it's hard-faced Diane Venora whining about how cop Al Pacino isn't THERE for her and her daughter (Natalie Portman), how she gets only part of his life, etc. Haven't we suffered through this boring situation in a hundred cop pictures? Then there are the uninteresting marital problems criminal Val Kilmer is having with Ashley Judd; who cares? Finally, there's the loony, preposterous, extraneous, wholly unbelievable relationship Robert De Niro has with Amy Brenneman, who plays a lovestruck artist/shopgirl who takes one look at De Niro, begins flirting with him, and is soon taking him to bed. Yeah, right: Here's a beautiful, glamorous-looking young woman who throws herself at a middle-aged, mean-and-careworn-and-greasy-looking guy who initially pretends to be a salesman and carries on a halting conversation worthy of a dullard. The relationship has no bearing on the plot that I could see; it's just an impediment and an annoyance. Thank God for the fast-forward on my remote.",6,7,13,22 April 2005
Contact," A surprise on the DVD
","This is a clearly a high-prestige sort of sci-fi movie, what with Carl Sagan's name attached, and no doubt a large budget. Frankly, I was disappointed; I found it very talky, more pretentious than profound (as if, for a largely science-fiction-fan audience, there's anything daring or even controversial in the notion of funding scientific research and reaching out to possible extraterrestrial life!), freighted with a truly awful, unwatchable performance by Matthew McConaughey (with his accent, popping eyes, and bared teeth, he seems to be doing a bad impression of William F. Buckley, Jr.), and featuring only two action scenes, one of them genuinely gripping, the other so-so. // What interested me more than the film itself was listening to two of the three commentaries included on the DVD. The one by director Robert Zemeckis addressed itself almost entirely to the complicated and expensive special effects that seem a component of just about every scene; it's an initially interesting subject that eventually grows tedious and rather dry. Conversely, the voice-over commentary by Jodie Foster shows that this intelligent actress and filmmaker is even brainier, more thoughtful, and more articulate than I'd imagined. Her performance in the commentary is, in fact, even more impressive and gratifying than her performance on screen.",6,1,3,22 April 2005
