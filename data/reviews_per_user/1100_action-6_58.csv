The Rock," The Rock is a fast-paced powerhouse of an actionthriller!!
","The Rock is a perfect actionthriller.  It has three brilliant actors: Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris. Some war-veterans under the command of general Hummel(Harris) steal some rockets containing VX-gas. One of these rockets are able to kill 70000 people, and the soldiers occupy Alcatraz alias 'The Rock', and they take 60 tourists hostage. The terrorist want to launch their rockets if their demands aren`t met. Mason(Connery) is a prisoner, who has vital knowledge about Alcatraz, and how to get in there, because he is the only man who has been able to escape from the Rock.  Goodspeed(Cage) is an FBI-agent, who is really good with chemestry, and it is his mission to disarm the rockets.   However, the team which is sent in to take out the veterans is soon wiped out in a bloody shoot-out with the veterans.  Only Mason and Goodspeed survived this slaughter. The Rock has interesting characters, and spectacular actionscenes.   The extra ice in the cake is the magical soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer, which creates a perfect atmosphere.

Alien 3," A step in the wrong direction, but still a good sequel
","Alien3 continues where Aliens ended.  Ripley lands on a planet, where dangerous criminals are kept in a prison. However, a dog aboard Ripleys ship has an alien inside himself.  The alien soon bursts out of the poor dog, and it soon kills a lot of the prisoners. Alien3 is a very good movie, but it is not as good as Aliens.8/10",7,1,3,10 May 2000
Antz," A more mature version of 'A bug`s life'
","'Antz' is a computer-made movie about ants in about the same way as 'A bug`s life', but 'A bug`s life' was a bit for the kids, 'Antz' is an animated film for a more mature audience. The storyline has it`s flaws, and 'A Bug`s life' does look a bit better, but 'Antz' still has its moments of glory. The characters are all excellent and the voice-overs are made by actors like Gene Hackman, Woody Allen and Sylvester Stallone. It is a fun movie, and it is great to finally see a great animated film which is meant to be viewed by a more mature audience. 8/10",Null,0,0,15 August 2000
Casablanca," One of those movies that every movie-fan must see once in his lifetime
","Casablanca(Spanish for White House) is one of those old classics that every movie-fan should see once, and I saw it for the first time recently.  I wasn`t expecting much of this movie since it was very old(1942), but the movie still managed to impress me.  All the actors are good but I wasn`t impressed by Bogarts stiff character in this movie(I have not seen him in other movies). 8/10",1,7,83,6 July 2000
Monty Python's Life of Brian," This movie is so funny!
","There are few films that are as funny as Life Of Bryan.  I must have seen this movie at least 25 times, but it`s just as funny every time I see it. There are so many strange things happening in this film, so you`ll 'discover' new jokes every time you see it.  It makes fun of everything The Bible and everything holy, and it is just perfect. 10/10",Null,2,7,8 June 2000
Mulan," An excellent adventure
","Mulan came as a bit of a surprise after the rather shallow 'Hunchback of Notredame' from  1997. Mulan is the name of a Chinese girl and takes place in ancient China. China is attacked by its enemies and the emperor decides that a man from each family must serve in the army.  Mulan`s father must once again be a soldier, but he is old and sick. Therefore Mulan disguises herself as a boy, and takes her father`s place in the army.  But that proves to be very tough. The animation in Mulan is simply stunning, the character-voices are good and the songs are fine.   9/10",8,3,3,10 May 2000
As Good as It Gets," Nice comedy
","As good as it gets has many great actors, specially Jack Nicholson, who is superb as the strange Mr. Udall. The movie has nice characters, a nice story and the eccentric Mr. Udall takes the movie to a level, which it wouldn`t have touched without this great unsympathetic character. 9/10",Null,0,0,8 June 2000
Citizen Kane," Essential!
","'Citizen Kane' is widely known as the best movie ever made, and for once, this is no exaggeration. 'Citizen Kane' is a fantastic, flawless masterpiece, with suspense, great camera angles, dialogue and everything a movie-fan could ever want(well, it lacks sex and violence, but this movie does fine without that sort of things). I just finished watching this movie for the first time in my life this evening, and I had to try writing a review right away. In the world of classic movies, 'Casablanca' and many others don`t stand a chance against good old 'Citizen Kane'. 10/10",Null,0,1,5 December 2000
Alien: Resurrection," Ripley is back. How the he&`Â¤ did they do that?
","Alien Resurrection brings you (who would`ve guessed) the resurrection of Ripley. Humans breed the dangerous aliens at a secret spacestation. However, something soon goes terribly wrong, and about 15 aliens are on the loose in the station. Ripley has been cloned, and she is kept in the same spacestation.  Now she must continue her fight against the aliens. Alien Resurrection manages to surpass Alien3.  Lots of spectacular special-effects, lots of action and more shocks than before.9/10",9,0,0,10 May 2000
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Extremely funny!!!!!!!!
","I finally got a chance to see 'South Park: Bigger, longer & Uncut' yesterday, and it was a very very good movie. Stan, Cartman, Kenny and Kyle want to see a movie starring their favorite actors Terrance and Phillip. The problem is that the movie is R-rated, and that the boys are only 8 years old. They pay a man to get them tickets, and they love the film. The film is Canadian, and makes the kids swear like hel# The kids` mothers form an organisation called MAC(mothers against Canada), and demand that the President declares war on Canada. They want to get rid of everything Canadian in America.  Canadians in America are sent to death-camps eehhhhhh...... vacation-camps. (This is just what happened in Nazi-Germany). This is a movie and not a tv-series, and the characters are able to swear a lot more. This is sheer perfection, and you must see this if you like the tv-series!! 10/10",Null,0,0,5 March 2000
Batman Returns," Tim Burton is the best
","Of the four Batman-movies, Batman Returns is the second best in the series. Batman Returns is as Batman directed by Tim Burton, who manages the dark adventure very well. Batman Returns` biggest weakness is the fact that it doesn`t have Jack Nicholson as a villain.  Instead it has Danny DeVito as The Pinguin, Christopher Walken as Mr. Schreck and Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.  This cast is also good, but not as good as Nicholsons` The Joker. I give Batman Returns the same score as Batman, but that doesn`t mean that the movie is as good is its older brother, but almost. 8,5/10",Null,0,0,16 June 2000
Blade," A superb movie!!
","Blade is one of the best action-films ever made.  Wesley Snipes plays Blade, who is 1/2 human, 1/2 vampire.  Blade is able to walk outside at daytime(he is therefore called 'Daywalker), and garlic & silver has no effect on him. He has got the strenght of a vampire, but he has also got the thirst for blood from the vampires.  To supress his thirst for blood, Blade uses a special serum. The first thing you`ll see in this movie is a woman, who is giving birth to a boy.  The woman has been bitten by a vampire, she dies, but the doctors are able to save her baby, Blade. Soon there is a party in a vampire-nightclub, Blade enters it and begins killing the vampires.  The action- and fight-scenes in this movie are incredibly well directed and cool to watch, the soundtrack is very suitable for this movie, and Wesley Snipes is perfect in the role as Blade.  Blade is a modern adventure, and takes place in an urban environment, instead of the rural environment that most vampire-movies takes place in. Don`t let the vampire-theme put you off this movie, because Blade is first of all an action-film. This is the best movie-based-on-comic film ever!!! 10/10",10,1,2,17 December 1999
Chicken Run," Disney has got a serious rival
","I saw this movie yesterday with its original dialogue, and I must say that I was stunned.  The creators who made the 'Wallace & Gromtit'-shorties have gone and delivered what has got to be one of the best movies of this year and one of the best animated-films ever. This film looks fantastic, the voices are perfect, the setting is brilliantly created and the atmosphere of the chicken-farm in the 1950`s England is perfect. This is an animated film, that will be loved by kids and adults alike.  It is also a good and interesting story that is excellently told, and this keeps you glued until the end. Dump Disney`s latest effort 'Tarzan'(6/10) out the window, and get 'Chicken Run' right now!10/10",Null,0,0,10 September 2000
L.A. Confidential," Exciting thriller
","L. A. Confidential is a mystery-thriller set in Hollywood/LA in the 1950`s. It is a great film.  It has a great story with many original twists and turns, great acting from all the actors and even some action.  I borrowed this from my local library and was quite surprised to find out how good it was. This is a movie where none of the characters are 100% good-guys.  Most of the characters are corrupt in some way or another, but you`ll never guess who the real villain is before he lets his dark secret out of the bag. 9/10",Null,0,1,22 June 2000
The Terminator," Excellent action/sci-fi
","This movie stands as one of the best and most original action-movies to come out of Hollywood and the series is Arnold Schwarzenegger`s finest hour. It is an amazing film that James Cameron made with a small-budget, and I think that this movie is superior to the blockbuster-sequel(because the annoying John Connor is nowhere to be found).  The effects may seem a bit old-fashioned now, but that makes this an enjoyable cult-film.  Some of the music is totally classic(the Terminator-theme), but parts of it are quite poor now.  The actionscenes are very good, and I think more violent than in 'Terminator 2'. The original Terminator-movie is still a must-see. 9/10",Null,0,0,15 August 2000
Alien," The first in the brilliant series, but not nearly as essential as its sequels.
","Alien is the first movie in the saga of Ripley.  The movie has not aged well, but it is worth a watch if you have watched the other three movies. The movie has poor effects and poor acting, which is improved in the sequels. The only thing that makes it worth seeing is the fact that it is an Alien-movie, but it lacks the excitement, action, tension and atmosphere of the next three Alien-movies. 5/10",5,5,14,9 May 2000
Battleship Potemkin," An important piece of cinema-history
","'Battleship Potemkin' is a silent movie made in the Soviet-Union in 1925 by master-director Sergej Eisenstein. This powerful movie remains after almost 80 years a landmark in cinema-history.  The movie tells the story of the crew on-board Battleship Potemkin during the revolution of 1905 after Russia had lost the war against Japan. On one side this is pure communist propaganda, on the other side this is probably one of the most powerful movies ever created. I saw this movie myself last year after my university teacher in Russian history recommended it to me.  Powerful imagery is the main element that you will remember after seeing this movie, especially the scene where people are slaughtered at the steps of Odessa in the Ukraine. See it.",Null,1,2,29 February 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," 'Lord of the Films'
","'Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' has got to be one of the best, if not the best, movies ever made. Based on the superb novel by Tolkien, this film is a great story of the battle between good and evil. It contains elements that scare you, make you laugh and make you cry, and then it manages to be a totally unique movie. How Peter Jackson, the director of cult classics such as 'Bad Taste', 'Meet The Feebles' and 'Braindead', managed to make a movie of such high quality is perhaps difficult to understand. One thing is certain, this movie rocks, and I can`t wait for the 2 next movies!!!10/10",10,0,0,3 February 2002
Armageddon," Great effects and music, but not without its problems
","Armageddon has special-effects to die for, and a majestic orchestral-soundtrack.  But Armageddon is not without its problems.  I hate Ben Affleck and his really poor performance in this film, some of the effects in the space-scenes are rather corny.   I know many people who hate Armageddon, but I don`t.  I think its a pretty good movie with spectacular special-effects.  Bruce Willis is also great as the hero, but I think that some of the supporting-roles are rather over the top and unnecessary. You should rent this one. 7/10",8,1,1,6 June 2000
The Shining," A scary masterpiece
","The Shining is a truly terrifying movie.  Jack Nicholson`s character agrees to look after a hotel during the winter, but something really bad happened at the hotel 10 years ago..... This movie is a great showcase for Jack Nicholson to show his extremely good acting-abilities, he is truly great as the normal family man who becomes a psycho. Many scary scenes and nice directing too, by Stanley Kubrick. This is THE horror-movie that everybody must see sometime. 10/10",Null,0,0,14 June 2000
American Beauty," And I just went to see an ordinary movie
","'American Beauty' was a movie which surprised me a lot.  I saw it expecting something just above average, but it ended up being a very, very good movie, that was (almost) perfect in every sense. The actors in this movie all do a great job, and nothing is what it seems to be in this movie. 9,5/10",10,0,0,30 December 2000
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Excellent movie, but not as good as the first movie
","Terminator 2 was the most expensive movie in the world when it was released back in 1992.  This movie is a big-budget-blockbuster, whereas the original movie was a cultish action/sci-fi made on a small budget. The extra cash means cooler and more spectacular actionscenes, tons of special-effects(but they look a bit crap now) and better-looking scenery. The movie is almost as good as the original, but this is why I think the original Terminator is a bit better: it doesn`t have the annoying and completely useless brat whose name is John Connor, it was an overall darker movie and Schwarzenegger was more sadistic(which is what The Terminator is all about). Still, it is a must see for those who`ve seen T1, just turn your head away from the TV-screen when John Connor(Eddie Furlong) enters the screen. 9/10",7,4,5,18 August 2000
Face_Off," John Woo is the King of Action!!!!!!!
","John Woo is the best actiondirector in the world. Face/Off(has nothing to do with the sport called ice-hockey)is his third American film after he arrived from Hong-Kong. John Travolta plays Sean Archer, who is a FBI-agent.  Nicolas Cage plays Castor Troy, a psychotic terrorist. While the opening credits are still running, Archers son is killed at a theme park.  The murderer is Troy, and this is how Archers obsession of killing Troy starts. 6 years later, Archer and his FBI buddies traps Troy at an airport.  Troy reveals that he has hidden a bomb somewhere in L.A., just before Archer blows him away with a jet engine, and Troy falls into a coma. Troy`s brother is the only one who knows where the bomb is hidden, so Archer must take on Troy`s face and body, in order to know where the bomb is. While Archer is undercover in prison, Troy wakes from his coma, takes on Archers face and VOILA`!  The two characters have know changed identity. The fact that John Woo is on board as director is visible in every shot. The action scenes are gorgeous to look at, but not as violent as some people believe.  Face/Off is indeed a very violent film, but it is kindergarten when compared to John Woo`s Hong-Kong movies like Hard Boiled and The Killer. However, this does not keep Face/Off from being a very enjoyable movie, that all of you should see. 10/10",10,1,2,10 December 1999
Aliens," Aliens is a solid actionadventure.
","Aliens is the sequel to Alien.  The planet where the cast from Alien discovered the alien is now inhabitaded by families. One day, the outsideworld loses contact with the families on the planet, and a group of marines is sent in to investigate, together with the heroine from the first movie: Ripley. 'spoiler alert' They discover that all the families except a small girl has been killed by the aliens.  Now, Ripley and the remaining marines must fight a battle to survive. Packed with tons of aliens, better actors, more action, better direction etc. Aliens manages to kick its older average brother right out the window! A must see!9,5/10",9,0,0,10 May 2000
Pearl Harbor," Pathetic!!!
","'Pearl Harbor' is a terrible movie. Yes, it is a pathetic love story between characters you do not care about, and all of the actors are terrible as well. This movie lasts for over 3 hours, and it seems like an eternity. The only good thing about the movie is that the attack on Pearl Harbor is pretty good, but it does not justify sitting through a boring love story for 3 hours. This movie was a waste of my time!1,5/10",Null,1,3,3 February 2002
Die Hard 2," John McClane is back with a bang!
","Die Hard 2 is the sequel to the fabolous action-movie Die Hard 1. John McTiernan refused to direct the sequel to his blockbuster, so it was up to Renny Harlin to direct Die Hard 2:Die Harder. John McLane is at Dulles Airport waiting for his wife, and as usual something goes terribly wrong. A South-American dictator has been arrested, and it just so happens that he is going by plane to Dulles Airport. The dictator has many followers in the US, and terrorists blackmail the airport. They demand that the dictator is given a new plane when his plane has landed. Once again, it is up to McLane to save the day and his wife! The action is once again mostly flawless, and every bit as good as the original. 10/10",10,1,3,30 January 2000
Saving Private Ryan," Spectacular war-movie
","Saving Private Ryan is Steven Spielberg`s second world-war2-themed film(the first was the excellent Schindler`s List). We follow some American soldiers who are fighting against Hitler`s Wehrmacht in Normandie.  The opening scene is spectacular and extremely violent, but then that was how the Allies managed to get over the English channel and over to France. The movie is very good, it has both realistic war-scenes and great drama(although The Thin Red Line focuses more on drama). All in all I can honestly say that Spielberg has gone and delivered the goods again, and what we have here is yet another important movie.  I prefer this over The Thin Red Line, even if it doesn`t have the excellent soundtrack of The Thin Red Line. 9/10",10,0,0,17 June 2000
Schindler's List," Frighteningly realistic
","Schindler`s List is an over 3 hour long drama in black/white. This in itself is more than enough to put off younger viewers from watching this film.  The movie is about Oskar Schindler who came to Poland as a business man, and ended up saving 1100 Jews from extermination. The fact that the movie is filmed in black and white is quite a masterstroke from Steven Spielberg.  This means that the movie looks like an old documentary, instead of a feature-film from Hollywood.  The movie is packed with emotions and shows who war brings out the cruelty in all people.  Being able to understand the German language, I was delighted to see that small-talk between the soldiers were in genuine German and not English. The scenes from the concentration-camps(KZ-LAGER)are really scary and nasty, but very realistic. Prepare yourself to watch the cruelties of the Nazis in a way that you won`t see in other feature-films, only in documentaries. 10/10",2,2,19,17 June 2000
From Dusk Till Dawn," It used to be a classic
","'From Dusk Till Dawn' is one of those movies that rocked when they came out, but time hasn`t been nice to this vampire-action-movie.  The effects are pretty dated, and the plot becomes slow and predictable.  Still, it delivers plenty of cool action, great splatter and some very cool one-liners. It is still a very good movie, but it has lost the classic feel that it had 4 years ago. 8,5/10",10,0,0,26 August 2000
Mission: Impossible II," John Woo has delivered the goods!
","John Woo has done it again!  He has created a massive action thriller that guaranteed will become this summer`s biggest blockbuster, and probably one of the best movies of 2000. The movie stars, just as the original, agent Ethan Hunt.  Hardly a single shot was fired in the original movie, but all that has changed since this movie is directed by my favorite director, John Woo.  John Woo is the master of the action movie and can create stylish action scenes in a way that American action directors only can dream about. The last half of the movie shows you action scenes that will have you weeping with joy.  The action scenes in this movie are so cool! I can`t see why this movie was rated PG-13 in America, because the amount of violence means that it should`ve been given the R-rating(but then the little kids wouldn`t get to see this) Some people out there seem to think that John Woo has just copied the amazing action scenes of 'The Matrix'.  This is completely wrong. These people don`t understand that the action scenes of 'The Matrix' weren`t original, because the directors 'borrowed' heavily from John Woo movies like 'Hard Boiled', 'The Killer' and 'Face/Off'.  The actionscenes in MI-2 are pure John Woo.The actors are great.  I never really liked Tom Cruise much, but he is good in this movie.  I really liked that Tom Cruise did all his stunts on his own, because John Woo`s previous Hollywood-blockbuster 'Face/Off' suffered from the fact that it was many times very easy to see that the spectacular scenes were done by stunt-men.  John Woo hasn`t tried to disguise the fact that this movie is pure entertainment and nothing else, but it is nice to see that the spy-element is also present.  Go to the cinema and prepare for a rollercoaster ride that is tougher and meaner than any James Bond-movie! 10/10",10,1,2,13 July 2000
A Bug's Life," A Disney-film with great looks and it is also a lot of fun
","'A bug`s life' is Disney`s second computer-made movie(the first was 'Toy Story'). This film isn`t about toys but about ants and insects.  The film looks amazing and is better-looking than 'Toy Story'.  This film is a lot of fun, with good characters, many nice and funny scenes and good voice-overs.  This movie is great fun, but Disney made better movies in the good old days. Still, 'A bug`s life' is one of Disney`s best efforts from the recent years. 8,5/10",Null,0,0,15 August 2000
Toy Story," Stunning animation, but the story was a bit lacking
","Toy Story is the first movie made with computers and not using real-life actors. This means that the movie is STUNNING to look at, and worth seeing just for that. However, the story is a bit average, when compared to the likes the classics Pinnochio and Snow White. The movie is good and the animation is a BIG plus, but Pinnochio, Snow White and The Lion King remain my favorites. 8/10",10,2,4,24 March 2000
Mission: Impossible," An atmospheric action/spy-movie
","Mission:Impossible is a kind of movie, that we haven`t seen too much of in the last couple of years: spy-films. Mission:Impossible is a well directed movie and it offers plenty spy-chit-chat to keep fans of agent-movies and quality-movies entertained. Tom Cruise plays Ethan Hunt, a member of the IMF(impossible mission force), and something goes terribly wrong during a mission at the Russian Ambassy in Prague. Ethan Hunt is the only member of the IMF-team to escape alive, and his superiors think that he is a traitor. Hunt escapes the interrigation, and begins clearing his name.But it is going to be hard.  The story is good, and features double-crossing between the characters like we have come to expect from this kind of movies. The actionpieces are also entertaining and well-directed.  The sequel will undoubtfully have better action because John Woo is directing it. Give it a go, you won`t be disappointed! 8/10",Null,1,2,1 February 2000
A Clockwork Orange," Good film
","A Clockwork Orange is one of Stanley Kubrick`s most known films and a good film.  The movie is about a young man who`s interested in ultraviolence, rape and Beethoven.  One day he is arrested and sent away to be cured. The movie is quite sick and has some violent action-scenes and scenes of raping, so I wouldn`t advice younger viewers to go for this one.  As many of Kubrick`s other movies, CO is a strange movie, but I thought that it was quite good. 8/10",Null,0,0,6 July 2000
Reservoir Dogs," This movie is SO cool!!
","Reservoir Dogs is an excellent gangstermovie.  The movie is about a robbery, which goes wrong.  The robbers know that one of them is a rat, because suddenly the cops are outside the bank. You never actually see the robbery, you just hear the characters talk about it.  The movie has tons of cool characters, violence and great dialogue. The plot is almost the same as 'City On Fire', and it is abvious that Tarantino was inspired by that hongkong-movie. Reservoir Dogs is an excellent movie that I would definetely like to recommend! 9/10",9,1,3,19 May 2000
Eyes Wide Shut," Strange movie
","Eyes wide shut is a strange movie.  It was hyped by Norwegian press for being extremely ultra-controversial, but it wasn`t that controversial.  The movie is quite slow, but it was filled with nice scenes directed by the now dead Stanley Kubrick.

Pulp Fiction," A marvellous movie
","Pulp Fiction is Tarantino`s second movie, and it is even better than Reservoir Dogs.  Pulp Fiction has stars like John Travolta, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel and Samuel L. Jackson, all those actors in a low-budget gangster movie. Tarantino`s script is fantastic, with lots of great characters, weird situations, great dialogue and violence. Pulp Fiction brought Travolta`s carreer back on track, and its easy to see why.  Travolta does a marvellous job as the gangster Vincent Vega.  All(most of) the actors are great in this movie. 10/10",10,0,0,19 May 2000

This movie could have been one of the best ever made(at least in the genre), if it hadn`t been for Leonardo DiCaprio.  I hate DiCaprio, he is a very poor actor, and very nearly destroys this movie.  However, the other actors are excellent, it has a solid director on board, and the best soundtrack ever composed. Titanic is also an important movie that every human on earth(at least in Western societies) should see once in their lifetime. 7/10",7,0,2,16 December 1999

The Matrix Reloaded," Better than its reputation
","POSSIBLE SPOILER'The Matrix' was one of the best American movies of 1999, and this movie proves that it is not easy to follow up on  a success as big as 'The Matrix'. 'The Matrix Reloaded' is the inevitable sequel to the 1999-masterpiece, but is it as good as the original?  No, a bigger budget and more gorgeous-looking action does not equal a better movie. You cannot deny that this as the first of two Matrix-sequels is one of the most ambitious movie-projects lately(apart from 'Lord Of The Rings' of course). 'The Matrix Reloaded' still suffers from Keanu Reeves poor acting, but this time also the lack of an adequate narrative.  The plot turns out to be unnecessarily difficult to follow and many, many scenes should have been explained more(like who the Merovingian really was, and the previous 'The One'). Much of the dialogue/monologue in this movie is in my opinion completely out of place and seems just like an excuse for the directors and writers to impress us with their knowledge of philosophy. One example of this is how the Merovingian suddenly delivers a long an quite unnecessary monologue about causality. I have studied philosophy, so I am familiar with the theories of causality, but this is not important for the telling of the story in this film. Another disappointment is the city of free men; the city of Zion. Zion as a city did not impress me, and it is a real problem for this movie that the directors did not convince me that it was worth fighting a (losing) war for this city. Despite of all these problems, this is good movie that is worth seeing. Why?  Matrix-fans will absolutely want see this, simply because it is a Matrix-movie. Remember that it is an absolute must to have seen the first movie, in order to understand anything at all. It also remains an impressive scifi-action-movie with action-scenes to die for.  It is also vastly superior to 'The Matrix Revolutions' which I think was the biggest disappointment of 2003. All in all, this was not so bad, it was actually quite good.7/10",Null,0,0,3 March 2004

German terrorists take over the building, though.  And it is up to McLane to save the day. Die Hard was the first modern movie of its kind, which resulted in a million copycats.

","With Hercules Disney enters the world of Greek mythology, but Hercules is not really worth seeing, since there in my opinion are many other far better Disneymovies(Mulan, Lion King, Pinocchio etc.) The story is about Hercules, the son of Zeus, who is kidnapped and grows up on Earth instead of in the resident of the Greek Gods. When he grows up,  Hercules wants to be a God, but first he has to show that he is a true hero, by doing several tasks. The animation in Hercules is certainly not up to Disney`s usual standard but ok nevertheless.  All the songs are very bad, and in my opinion completely pointless.  The film is sometimes entertaining but I felt bored at many points in this film. 5/10",5,1,3,2 June 2000
Die Hard with a Vengeance," McLane is back with a vengeance!
","Bruce Willis returns once again as John McLane in the third chapter of Die Hard. Die Hard With A Vengeance is solely situated in New York. A mad terrorist called Simon is detonating bombs in New York, and he`ll only stop if John McLane can perform some challenging tasks. John McLane is also joined by Zeus, and together they have to ride all over New York in a deadly timebased game. The action is quite different in Die Hard With A Vengeance than in DH 1&2, but it also means that it is a lot more 'puzzle-based' than the previous two films. For instance: McLane and Zeus are standing near a well, and they have 2 cans in which to fill water.  The amount of water in the 2 cans need to be exactly as much as said by Simon on the telephone.  If McLane and Zeus fail this little puzzle, the bomb situated in a suitcase next to them, will explode. This film is full of this kind of situations, and it makes for one he#' of a movie! 10/10",Null,1,2,30 January 2000
Con Air," Excellent actionthriller, but 'The Rock was better.
","Con-air can be viewed upon as the sequel to 'The Rock' because of the following things: 1) it has the same star(N.Cage) and producer(J. Bruckheimer) as 'The Rock' 2) storywise it can easily be what happened to Nicolas Cage`s character from 'The Rock, after he escaped Alcatraz. Nicolas Cage plays Cameron Poe, a military-officer who kills a man to protect his wife.  Poe is sentenced to 7 years in prison.  7 years later he is going aboard a plane called 'con-air', which will be taking him back to his wife and daughter. Everything is not running smoothly though, as the other convicts take over the plane. Poe does not want to be a part of the hijacking so he does what he can to prevent the plain from reaching the destination set by the other convicts, and he tries to tell the police where they are heading. The film has plenty of cool actionscenes and two quality actors(Cage and Malcowich).  However, the movie is not as good as 'The Rock', and the music is lame when compared to 'the Rock`s' soundtrack. It must still be said that Con-air is a very good movie and one of the best American actionmovies of 1997.  Rent it! 9/10",8,0,0,20 April 2000
Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," A classic!!
","Snowwhite and the 7 dwarfs is one of the best cartoon-movies ever made, and is much better than many of Disney`s newer movies.  The animation is brilliant, and could teach many modern cartoons a lesson or two about how to make a good cartoon-movie.  I guess that I don`t have to tell you much about the story, since most of you are familiar with it, but I`ll tell you some of it(in case some of you have missed out on this classic). Snowwhite(a princess) is the most beautiful woman in the country, which her stepmother(the queen) doesn`t like.  The queen orders her best hunter to kill Snowwhite when she is picking flowers.  The hunter is not able to kill Snowwhite, and she runs deeper into the forest.  The eventually discovers a small house, which is the dwarfs` house.  The queen finds out that Snowwhite is still alive. Snowwhite is a true classic, with superb animation and stunning soundtrack. It was also a groundbreaking movie, which meant that Disney could produce more high-class cartoon-movies to an audience which was gasping for more. 9,5/10",9,37,47,15 December 1999
The Lion King," Pure magic!
","The Lion King is Disney`s finest moment.  The story is excellent, the music is top-class and the voice-overs are perfect.Simba is the cub of the King Of 'Pride Rock', Mufasa, and nephew of the evil Scar.Scar wants to get rid of Simba and Mufasa, because he wants to be king himself.  Scar kills Mufasa and he gets the hyenas to chase Simba.  Simba escapes the hyenas and he is now alone. He teams up with outsiders Timon and Pumba, and the movie tells about these characters and how they live together.It is a classic tale of the battle between good and evil, it is backed up by fast-paced actionmusic composed by Hans Zimmer(The Rock, Crimson Tide, The Peacemaker), the other music is splendid too. The arguably best thing about 'The Lion King' is the way it looks. The animation is flawless, the attention-to-detail is awesome and it moves extremely smooth.10/10",10,1,2,11 October 1999
Scream," An extremely overrated 'horrormovie'
","Scream is one of the most overrated horrormovies ever.  Come on.  It is not the best horrormovie ever made, The Shining steals that crown easily.  Most of the actors deliver poor or average performances, and the movie isn`t any funny. But I guess that I`m in the minority. 6/10",7,0,0,15 June 2000
Halloween," The original, and the best
","Halloween is a good film, although its sequels (except H2) are pi#Â¤ poor. The movie starts in 1963, where 6 years-old Michael Myers kills his sister. He is later put away in a hospital, but one night in 1978, HE escapes! He returns to his childhood home, which by coincidence is situated close to Laurie Straude`s home(the main-character). Halloween revolutionised the horror-genre back in `78: it was scary, relatively fast paced, well directed etc. And it can still be proud to show its face in 1999, and it is much better than Scream and I still know what you did last summer. 8/10",8,0,0,13 December 1999
The Sixth Sense," Surprisingly good!
","I wanted to see this movie because Bruce Willis was in it. I was expecting an average thriller made better by one of my favorite actors. I was extremely surprised by the quality of The Sixth Sense. This has to be one of THE movies of 1999. Bruce Willis plays a psychologist who is working with children. One night he is attacked in his own home by one of his old clients, who is now a grown-up. Willis`s character is named  Malcolm Crowe, and he is determined to never fail again.  One day he is going to see a new client: a boy named Cole Sear, who is having some kind of unknown trouble. This movie is a horrorthriller, there  aren`t that many shocks in it, but it is a well directed and exciting film. Bruce Willis manages to act without having a pistol to rely upon, and Haley Joel Osment`s performance is well-above-average. 9/10",9,0,0,30 January 2000
The Matrix," You won`t believe your eyes!!
","The Matrix is an amazing film.  Everything about it is so high-class and polished.  The Matrix is a scifi/action movie, and the story focuses on telling us what the Matrix is.  I won`t spoil this massive movie for the poor souls, who haven`t seen it yet.  The actionscenes are amazing, it takes the classic style of John Woo, and adds the sci-fi element: the characters are now able to run up against a wall while they are shooting. 'Unfortunately nobody can be told what the Matrix is, you`ll have to see it for yourself'. 9/10",9,0,0,17 December 1999
Tarzan," Extremely good animation, but.......
","Tarzan is this year`s Disney-movie.  The movie released this time is Tarzan, who is a character that all of you probably know.  The animation is as slick as ever, but the classic Disney feel is gone.  I prefer the old Disney classics, like Snowwhite and Peter Pan.  It Disney continues this trend, they will end up with a very poor film next year. 6/10",6,1,2,17 December 1999
The Thin Red Line," Great war-film
","The Thin Red Line came out at almost exactly the same time as Spielberg`s Saving Private Ryan, and was therefore ignored by many. The Thin Red Line is directed with style by Terrence Mallick. It is a long movie(2h 50min)and sometimes it feels like its too long, but this movie is definetely worth your time.  The Thin Red Line focuses(unlike Saving Private Ryan) more on characters and less on spectacular war-scenes.  But both movies are great. But I must mention the spectacular orchestral soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer.  This is one of the best music I`ve ever heard in a movie, and really makes the movie more atmospheric. (The German documentary 'das dritte Reich in Farbe' used the same music). 9/10",Null,0,0,17 June 2000
Jackie Brown," A poor follow-up to Pulp Fiction
","Quentin Tarantino`s third movie is not in the same class as his previous two(Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction). The movie is about Jackie Brown, a stewardess, who gets caught smuggling. The movie doesn`t have the good characters and cool dialogue seen in Tarantino`s others films, and is therefore nowhere near as good as his previous films.  The amount of violence has also decreased dramatically since Pulp Fiction, and violence is one of the main ingredients in Tarantino`s movies.   Overall, Jackie Brown is quite lacking in all areas. 4/10",5,3,7,19 May 2000
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," A weird medieval comedy
","*some spoilers* King Arthur and his Knights are sent on a mission by God.  They must get the Holy Grail, but there are tons of weird and bizarre obstacles in their way. There are man-eating-killer rabbits and the Knights-who-say-Nih for instance. This movie shows how weird the Monty Python-gang are and is second to Life of Bryan. 9/10",8,0,0,8 June 2000
Gladiator," One word: SPECTACULAR!
","I saw Gladiator last Saturday and I was completely blown away by it. Russell Crowe is fantastic as General Maximus, who is betrayed, becomes a slave and later a gladiator.  When he is a gladiator, he seeks to revenge his wife and son, who were brutally murdered by the the new emperor. There are spectacular battle- and fightscenes in gladiator, great characters(both hero and villian), a blockbuster-soundtrack and also a great story.  I can`t recommend you enough to see this movie.  This has to be one of the best films in 2000.10/10",10,0,0,6 June 2000
Princess Mononoke," Just beautiful
","'Princess Mononoke' is a beautiful anime from the one and only Hayao Miyazaki. This is a superb movie with great characters, wonderful animation and music and it also has many important messages for its audience. Characters are not like your black-and-white disney-like stereotype where all the characters are as good or as evil as they can possibly be. No, all characters found here appear to be more like a human being, where everyone possess good as well as evil qualities.  Philosophy also plays an important part here, where one of the movie`s strongest themes is mankind`s relationship with nature. Miyazaki delivers once again a mesmerizing tale that possess both the power to entertain but also to make us think about our role in the world.10/10",Null,1,2,25 February 2004
The Wizard of Oz," Somewhere over the rainbow, all movies will be as good as this
","'The Wizard of Oz' stands as one of the all time Hollywood-classics. This is a movie, which should be loved by everyone.   This movie has got all it needs; great actors, great music, great story, great environments, fantastic colours, drama and friendship.   Younger people like me will perhaps remember the song 'Somewhere over the rainbow' from a much newer Hollywood-movie; the actionmovie 'Face/Off', but then the director of that movie loves classic musicals,  like the classic 'The Wizard of Oz'. You may not feel the need to go out and buy this, but you should definetely feel the need to see it.  It is a movie that you`ll never forget! 10/10",Null,1,2,4 December 2000
