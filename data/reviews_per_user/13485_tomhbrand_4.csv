Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Borat, Cutting Open The Belly Of America
","The latest full length adaptation of one of Sasha Baron Cohen characters is part gross-out comedy and part social satire on American society, as the charmingly clueless Kasakhstani reporter travels across the country to learn how to make his home town more like 'the greatest country in the world', along the way falling in love with Pamela Anderson and beginning a journey across America to find and marry her.The joy of Borat is the total cultural incompatibility combined with the easiest aspects of American culture to mock. (You notice how he travels through the southern states, not the north) And sometimes you find yourself unsure which is actually funnier, Baron Cohen's activities or the reactions he draws out of the American public. Some of the people he meets, especially at a rodeo in Texas, really do defy all belief and/or any faith in humanity.Of course the big question when watching films like this is exactly how much of it is done live and how much is staged, and how much the director had to manipulate to get the reactions they wanted. And of course when they want to make sure they get away with it. (Apparently the police were called on the actor 91 times during production) So sometimes you feel that people had to have been briefed on how to act to move the plot along/prevented being arrested, and sometimes the people say such horrible things they just have to be truly and deeply held beliefs. And the fact that so many people are currently trying to sue the production for the way they've been portrayed in the film, from drunk frat boys to a Romanian village, really proves that people are quite happy to say how they really feel to someone they think they have to be superior to.Despite all the things that he says and does you can't but help but like the character, because Sacha Baron Cohen manages to imbue the character with such innocence and charm that not once do you ever suspect any of the things he does or says are meant in malice, only total cultural misunderstanding. Especially as you just know there aren't people in the world who are really like this, and if you doÂ… well then the joke appears to be on you.The only point I felt slightly uncomfortable with is the fact that Baron Cohen uses a real country to use as a stereotype, when that might offend real people. But the whole point is that Borat is a collection of stereotypes that people will believe. A mixture of all the different beliefs that people have about poor eastern European countries. (Conversations you see in the film between Borat and his producer actually consist of a mixture of Russian, Yiddish and Armenian with the two actors speaking totally different languages to each other.) Deep down the underlying joke with Borat is that people are so uninformed that they actually believe that Borat's really exist somewhere in the world.But the main point that underlies all of this is the however offensive Borat is, or however much you cannot believe what you see on screen, you are laughing far too hard to care. There were times it hurt I was laughing so much. You can go into the film consciously acknowledging all the points that could make the film could be politically incorrect or possibly cause offence, but once you're watching it's impossible to take it seriously, and that's the whole point.I wouldn't say that this movie is to everybody's taste. Avoid if you take offence easily, but if you do remember that that you are missing one of the comic highlights of the year.",9,5,12,3 December 2006
Pan's Labyrinth," A Truly Modern Fairytale
","Guillermo del Toro how to tell a real fairy tale. A fairy tale that isn't all princesses, princes, magical fairies and happy endings. It might have them, but the point that has been sanitised out of fairy tales over the last century or so is the fact that they were originally cautionary tales for children, handed down through generations of oral tradition to teach children what life is. And what is the one fact that children should learn as soon as possible? That life is nasty!Laberinto del Fauno (titled Pan's Labyrinth here, though no mention is ever made to the faun in the film being Pan) is the story of Ofelia, a little girl forced to move with her pregnant mother to rural Spain to be near her step-father, a Captain in the fascist army during the Spanish Civil War. As she experiences first hand the horrors of war and fascism, she enters an ancient maze and meets a faun who tells her she is a lost Princess of an underground kingdom and must pass three tests to claim her place there.I will admit that I went into this film expecting a nice, children friendly movie, but del Toro pulls no punches when it comes to the war, a war he experienced as a child. It's hard sometimes to decide what was more important to the director; Ofelia's story, or whether that was just a backdrop to highlight all the more the cruelty and brutality of the war.There are no Indiana Jones style comedy Nazis here, the fascists are truly evil and we see it. Both the violence (which is just graphic enough to prevent us from being able to ignoring it without ever being gratuitous) and the mindsets of the people involved. What is more disturbing that any of the on screen actions is the attitude of 'pull the ladder up jack, I'm alright' of those who find themselves in privileged positions. Ariadna Gil, as Ofelia's mother showcases this perfectly. She knows full well what Vidal thinks of her only as a vessel for him unborn son, and that he probably killed Ofelia's father, but she never seems to resent him. Neither does she ever seem to love him. What you get is more a kind of relief, she knows that as long as he has a use for her she and her daughter are safe. It's purely self preservation, to know your place and survive, and that is more disturbing to me than anything else in the film.Sometimes it's even almost as if Ofelia's quest is the subplot, as even fantastical tales of giant toads, fauns, a magical kingdom, the Pale Man (a horrific creature with it's eye in its hands) pale into insignificance when we're faced with the true life horrors that we see mankind inflict upon itself.And that's one of the most interesting aspects of the story. Even as everything goes on around her, as the Civil War rages around her, her mothers life lies in Captain Vidal hands, what can the innocent do. Ofelia is not part of this world, she hasn't had a hand in creating it and she does not have a hand in affecting it's outcome. The faun and his quests are, to her at least, far more important as they are something that she is involved in, that are about her.On the technical side this is a beautifully crafted film. The cinematography and sets are wonderful, never once setting a difference between the real and the fantasy. Both aspects of the film seem just as important to del Toro, some directors would have favoured one or the other sides of the story and that would have made the film unbalanced.It's clearly influenced by many fairy tales, and a nice touch is, like many movie fairy tales, we never certain whether the fantasy is real. Is Ofelia really a lost princess from a magical kingdom, or are all her adventures and meetings purely from her imagination, one of the stories she tells to her unborn brother expanded to protect her from the nightmares of real life? What Guillermo del Toro has done with this film is to create a beautiful fairy tale masterpiece that harks back to the days when fairy tales were told around a fire to scare children, not read at bedtime to put them to sleep. But despite what I said earlier about this not being a children's film, take some to see it and I still think they'd enjoy it, even if it was from behind the cushion.",10,42,75,14 December 2006
The Holiday," A promising but disappointing holiday movie
","Nancy Meyers' The Holiday should be a nice little holiday movies. It should be the kind of movies you go to see with you boy/girlfriend for a quiet evening out or watch on DVD on a cold winter Sunday afternoon. It has a cute ensemble cast, a happy if predictable storyline and no ambitions to be anything more than it should be. But in execution it's just that there are too many irritating flaws to be able to enjoy it properly.For the sake of brevity I will skip voicing my opinions of the film' traditional US movies ideal of what England is like in winter; like the idea that we always have snow at Christmas, Winslet's Iris has a highflying job in the city, but then goes home everyday to her rural cottage in the country, and security guards at Heathrow never, ever refer to people as 'M'um' when going through your luggage! But the main problem in this film is that unfortunately Meyers has the strange belief that Cameron Diaz is the star of this film, and therefore should be carrying it at all times. From the get-go she is given the lions share of the screen time, trying so desperately to be funny and force out the laughs that it get embarrassing. She's trying so hard to look like a natural comedian that it reminds me far too much of other times she's tried so hard to be funny, such as The Sweetest Thing and the Charlie's Angels films. (Just typing the names I get sharp pains in my very soul.) What also doesn't help is how unsympathetic her character comes across to us; the highly successful film editor who owns her own company, has a huge house in LA. Oh no! Her life is so bad, I really feel for her. Even as she dumps her boyfriend for cheating on her at the start of the film we are clearly shown that it's her fault for refusing open up to anyone that has destroyed her relationships (leading to some very hackneyed character development involving her being unable to cry, therefore connect emotionally with people, since her parents divorced.) And this is a real shame as the other half of the film, with Winglets and Black's Iris and Miles, along with Eli Wallach's wonderful Billy Wilder-esqe screenwriter Arthur, works so well. These two 'secondary' characters are genuinely nice people, suck in bad relationships but needing to grow to escape them. Kate Winslet in particular creates a wonderfully sweet woman, unable to fall out of love with a colleague who uses her and desperate to find something new. She and Black just seem so much more relaxed and at ease with each other, with Black in sweet, chubby loser mode rather than 'Jack Black' mode, and they act Diaz and Jude Law off the screen whenever they come on.I think Wallach's Arthur Abbott has a lot to do with this, as most of Iris and Miles story focuses around him and the influence they have on each other, whereas with Amanda and Graham it's all about them, even when the cute children are introduced they are just one more thing to bring the two of them closer.To be fair it does get better if you stick with it. About half way through it settles into the story, Diaz seems to stop desperately trying to be funny, and Law is given something to do other than play up to his own media stereotype, and they amazingly actually start acting and their story starts gaining the heart it has been lacking at the start. But by this point the plot is so painfully obvious it's too late to save the film.The Holiday does have it's good points, but they're almost all when Winslet is on screen. You leave the cinema with the feeling that if Meyers could have managed to write the story just involving Iris and Miles and left Amanda and Graham out completely she would have had a very nice Christmas movie. As it is, it comes across as a sub-par star vehicle/chick flick.",4,1,4,13 January 2007
The Queen," The Queen
","Stephen Frears' new film was a bit of a question for me, whether it was going to be any good or just a nice little portrait Queen Elizabeth the Second telling us nothing we didn't already know. Sitting back now I can't understand why I questioned Frears at all.What this film's best point is, is that it never takes one side in anything. Almost every character is given their side or opinion, and none of them are made to seem in the wrong. The Royal Family wanting to keep the whole matter of Diana's death as quiet as possible, for the sake of dignity and the two princes, and New Labour wanting to go with the public opinion, make an event of it, and use this as a chance to modernise an institution many feel is archaic. At one point Prince Phillip points out that Diana was two totally different people; to the Royals she was the mother of the future King of England, an ex-wife, adulterous (come on, is Charles Harry's father? Look at him!) and a complete embarrassment. Even Blair states at one point she 'seemed to spend 24/7 trying to bring down everything they hold dear', but to the public she was a saint, Princess of Hearts (God I hate that phrase) charity worker, a martyr of the establishment and each side could not understand the others point of view.And it's here that the very heart of the film lies, in managing to portray the very heart of British society, this combination of tradition and modernization. What made this time so striking and resounding was that it starkly highlighted these two aspects and brought them to a point where it almost seemed that one would overcome the other. For what seemed like the first time the Queen did not understand her subjects wishes for her. The Queen has her family telling her that she is totally right to act the way she does, tradition dictates it. Tony Blair has members of his party, lead by the one character who seems to have no redeeming features, Alastair Campbell, who see anything that make the party look good should be used to full effect.The actors are amazing, mainly because they seem to have avoided trying to do impressions of those they portray and instead act the characters. Special mention has to go to Michael Sheen as an excellent Tony Blair. (Am I the only one who really sees a physical resemblance between the young Tony Blair and Alan B'stard?) Sheen has captured the exact voice and mannerisms of the PM, and manages to portray both the ambitious, successful politician and a man incredibly nervous in the job he actually has to do, realising in this crisis exactly how hard it will be to balance everything together, slowly realising what it must have been for the Queen for over 50 years.But, of course, this is totally Helen Mirren's film. Her portrayal of Elizabeth is perfect, showing us behind the woman who everyone claimed had no heart, merely being a woman in a time beyond her generation who is facing the fact she is not as in touch as once she was with the feelings of the public. A person who has done a job for nearly half a century as best she can, given her life to her country, and suddenly find herself the focus of public hatred. Having to take advice from a Prime Minister who hasn't been in office 6 months As she points out to Blair towards the end; enjoy you're popularity, as one day the public will turn on you just as they turned on me.This may only be based of real events, and we don't know if this is how events really went, but in this film we have a portrait of modern England, the internal conflict that makes the country was it always has been, and something that puts human faces on those we never see as people.",9,1,3,13 November 2006
