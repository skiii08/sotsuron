The Blair Witch Project," Be Afraid!!!
","This is the best horror/thriller movie I've ever seen.  Despite the absence of ax wheeling maniacs and masked blood thirsty killers, this film will scare the wits out of you.  Blair Witch uses a much better tactic for fear, the viewer's imagination.  You never seen the witch but it still gets you. You will never look at the woods the same again.Even though the story is fictional and even the legend the film is based on is made up, you begin to forget that as you watch.This is a very well made and frightening film.",10,1,3,4 August 1999
