It," Great Film, Sparks Deep Thinking
","This is a fantastic film and the story line was amazing. Upon watching this film, I noticed that there were such strong themes that resonate with Pennywise that were present in the film. These themes included fear, fear controlling the characters and fear distracting and manipulating them from living their day to day lives. Have you ever noticed how these themes play out in our own lives when we let fear become bigger than us? Often times we let it control us, hinder us, and knock us down until we are helpless on the floor. However, (SPOIL ALERT) When the kids recognize what it was that was scaring distracting, manipulating them and controlling them, they knew just how to combat It. And that was by stepping outside of fear and soon they had authority over the very thing that was the source of their anxieties.
Watching this movie as a Christian, it really made me think (and these are just my personal thoughts) about how much Pennywise represents fear and how the devil uses the very fears that he knows will cause a distraction from living a day to day life to effectively control our lives. But there's good news to this. The good news is that we don't have to live in fear. Just as these kids stood up to Pennywise and said, 'I'm not afraid' we can stand up to the fears in our own lives and combat them in whatever way we can. For me, it's Christ. I know that there are times when I struggle so much with worry and anxiety. However, knowing how to overcome it with the power of Christ, who died on a cross for you and me to take away our pain and torment, really has helped strengthen me in these areas. When we stand up to our fears and say, 'I am not afraid,' we are capable of doing so much more than we can ever think. God bless!",8,0,1,8 December 2018
