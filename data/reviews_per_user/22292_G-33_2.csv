Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Awesome special effects
","This was a great movie. I knew the special effects would be great but I was stunned never the less. I also liked the computer animation. It was fun watching the lightsaber fights with Darth Maul. If you haven't seen this movie, see it!",10,0,0,30 May 1999
Titanic," Decent
","This movie had lots of potential, but because of poor acting jobs (with the exception of Cathy Bates) it was only decent. It is worth seeing but it will probably not be your favorite movie unless you find it so romantic that it rules out the bad acting.",6,2,3,23 April 1999
