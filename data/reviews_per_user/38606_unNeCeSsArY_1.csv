Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Better than Vol.1???
","I thought that Vol. 2 was much better than the first for several reasons. To begin with, I thought that (and I say this as a guy who didn't flinch at Saving Private Ryan) the first one was much too gory. Although it was brilliantly choreographed I found it to be an overload of violence. I didn't think that the dialogue was exceptional but Quentin Tarantino wanted to make a spaghetti western so he accomplished his mission. But just in terms of entertainment I found Vol. 2 much better. I loved how Tarantino broke down the movie into chapters and I was wondering why he decided to exclude the scene that was in the deleted scenes portion of the DVD. One could say that the reason why I didn't like the first one too much was because it didn't have an ending but I just thought that the second was better done. A thing I didn't understand though, was that Uma Thurman said at the beginning that she only had one more person to go after, Bill, so why did she go after Bud?",Null,0,1,23 August 2004
