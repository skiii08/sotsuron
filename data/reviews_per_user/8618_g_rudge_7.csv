Walk the Line," Good, but i was disappointed
","It is good, there is no doubt about that, coz if it wasn't then Reese Wetherspoon wouldn't have gotten the Oscar for it now would she, yet when i watched it i was disappointed because i was expecting this great film of Epic proportions like the Media made it out to be, which annoyed me! Obviously being a biopic i cant really comment on the plot, because its a real life story and a fantastic one at that - the life of Johnny Cash and June Carter (Phoenix and Wetherspoon).I think they could have cast someone better as Johhny Cash other than Joaquim Phoenix, but Reese was perfect for June Carter. I didn't like the end to the film and in some places i thought the film could be better. Overall - Good, but disappointing!",6,1,3,3 July 2007
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Politically Incorrect, rude, ignorant and one of the funniest things i have ever seen
","in my life.The film follows insane Kazakh reporter Borat Sagdiyev and his friend Azhamat travelling across America in the hope of making a film that would help better Kazakhstan. In the film, Sacha Baron Cohen tries to insult everyone, including Americans, femenists, gypsy's, gay's, the country of Uzbekistan and last but definitely not least - Jews.His trip is amazingly funny, masturbating publicly in a New York street, kidnapping Pamela Anderson, and running through a hotel stark naked.The people who took offence to this film should be shot. Its not meant to be taken seriously and the people who did take it seriously need to lighten up and see the funny side. This film blatantly pokes fun at America and its people, as well as Russia and Kazakhstan.Bravo to Cohen (who is Jewish himself) for making this cinematic masterpiece.",10,4,8,1 January 2008
3:10 to Yuma," Fantastic
","I watched this film on sky a couple of days ago and to be honest, it is one of the best films i have seen in a long time. The story takes place around criminal and train robber Ben Wade (Russell Crowe), who is caught in the act and has to be transferred to the town of Contention to catch the 3:10 to Yuma prison train. He is transferred by a convoy of people, including Dan Evans (Christian Bale), his teenage son William (Logan Lerman) and a handful of others.The films plot line takes them on paths of self discovery, which shows a more emotional side to the western, as well as some old fashioned gun slinging with rival tribes and railway engineers, making the film action packed and very dramatic.To me though, it is 16 year old Logan Lerman who definitely steals the show from the Hollywood heavyweights such as Russell Crowe, Christian Bale and Peter Fonda to emerge as this fantastic young talent, who's character William comes of age in the film, and see's his father whom he never aspired to, turn from being a lowlife to a hero.The film is very good, and cinematography of the film is incredible, and it definitely brings back the days of the old western to a moder glory.",9,0,1,24 August 2008
Mamma Mia!," A good laugh and good fun, if a little cheesy
","Being the 17 year old straight male, many would think i should hate this, but i didn't - i thought it was great.The best thing about this is of course the songs, which span from Waterloo (1974) to Lay All Your Love On Me (1981), and they really do fit in with the story line of Sophie (played by Amanda Seyfried) who is marrying her fiancée Sky (Dominic Cooper) at her mother Donna's (played amazingly by Meryl Streep) Greek hilltop Villa / Hotel. The only problem is, Sophie wants her father to walk her down the aisle, yet realises from her Mothers diary that it could be 1 of 3 different men. Sophie invites the men to her Wedding, without telling anyone. The 3 men arrive and chaos ensues. Christine Baranski and Julie Walters are hysterical, and i personally think they make this movie as Donna's 2 best friends, serial divorcée Tanya (played by Baranski) and Rosie (played by Walters.) But the film does have its faults, especially the chorus of Greek's that keep popping up, make it cringeworthy at times (no disrespect to the Greeks) and some moments in the film will make you want to throw up, but on the whole, this film is pretty good. Its the type of film you want to see for a feel good laugh out loud moment. And i thoroughly enjoyed it!",8,2,3,15 July 2008
The Lion King," one of my all time favourites
","i remember going to the cinemas to see this when i was 3, its the first film i remember watching and i loved it then, and i still love it now. Johnathon Taylor Thomas puts up a great performance for the voice of young simba and when his father dies its his voice that makes me melt and cry (yes i do cry at this film!) It is brilliantly animated, the songs are great and the star studded cast (although you don't see them) are brilliant, especially Whoopi Goldberg as the Hyena. Still today it remains one of my favourite films, i watch it all the time, mainly on sundays when there is nothing else on TV. I love this film...",10,2,4,29 July 2007
Goodfellas," One of the best films ever made!
","I absolutely ****ing love it! I watched it a couple of weeks ago for the first time and i was captivated. Scorsese worked his magic on the story of Henry Hill, as being a 16 year old by i have become fascinated with. He's an Itlaian-Irish gangster and he produced in my opinion one of the best films ever made. De Niro, Liotta and Pesci shine in the film but i think its Lorraine Bracco who plays Karen who absolutely steals the show, playing the Jewish girl from a quiet neighbourhood, thrown into the world of Cocaine dealing, murders and violence. Its undoubtedly one of my favourite films and I'm sure it will be for a long time. How the film is mainly narration is what i really love about it, and along with the soundtrack by artists such as the Crystals and Shangri-las, make this film amazing and brilliant to watch!",10,1,2,19 June 2007
The Simpsons Movie," It was OK... media attention killed it for me...
","Im a huge simpsons fan, and to be honest i thought my expectations of this film were too high. The Plot line is good - Homer dumping pig waste in a lake causes an environmental Disaster, and it is funny in places yet all the funny parts of the film were shown in the TV trailers - such as 'spiderpig, spiderpig, does whatever a spiderpig does' i thought just wasn't funny there in the big screen - plainly because i had already seen it 99 million times on TV.The animation though on the film is brilliant - by far the best thing about the film - its sharp and much better than in the TV series, it has to be one of the best animation on films ever - yet it isn't the amazing film everyone makes it out to be.Overall i thought the film was overrated and that the media attention surrounding the film was a shame, as it really spoilt it for me. Im a huge simpsons fan - yet i think a classic show like the simpsons should be kept to the small screen where it belongs. A film was too much.",3,5,9,10 August 2007
