Requiem for a Dream," disturbingly fantastic.
","I remember watching this movie for the first time.  It was on cable. I was very sorry not to have caught it on the movie screen.  I was with my younger sister and her boyfriend.  We were just chatting and playing, and the movie for the first 10-15 minutes just played in the background.  Then, suddenly we were riveted. Usually, the term edge of your seat, is saved for thrillers, but we were, all three of us at the edge of our seats. No talking allowed, no whispers, we all formed these self preserved bubbles around us, and we watched, amazingly and totally spell bound.Movies like Requiem, are special, because they remind you of the power of film. They are what all films should be, and what few films rarely achieve. I remember clearly the conversation after the movie ended.  It was amazing, we were on a high.  The film itself was a drug... and I can't wait till the director's next film comes out, cause I need a fix of that genius.",9,0,1,3 September 2003
Catch Me If You Can," Charmed, I'm sure!(maybe one spoiler.)
","What a charmer of a film this was.  Leonardo DeCaprio was breezy,delightfully fun as the lead.  and Tom Hanks, was perfect as the FBI agent chasing after him.  The Knock, Knock line is a classic.But most importantly, the screenplay was truly outstanding. I can imagine the screenwriter having a BALL writing the script, enjoying himself immensely after he wrote, page, after page of clever dialogue, fun moments, and narrow escapes.  I felt like I was living the experience along with the character.What can I say, that hasn't already been said about the director, Steven Spieldberg, he is beyond criticism at this point, although, I have found in his last few films, that he just doesn't know how to end them.  A.I. went on for much too long, and the ending of Minority Report,  well, it had about 3 different endings... With this film, the ending seemed to always be around the corner.  But then again, it wasn't, I was ready for the movie to end at the airport, where much of it had happened symbollically, but then there was an extra scene... but with such a clever, magical script, I really didn't mind if it had kept on going.Catch it, if you can!",9,1,2,1 July 2003
Monster," Charlize Theron!!! Wow!!!
","There are very few performances given by actresses that have floored me. Hilary Swank is Boys Don't Cry, Halle Berry in Monster's Ball, Ellen Burstyn in Requiem for a Dream.  Sure, Meryl Streep and countless other actresses give wonderful performances in their own right all the time.  But rarely does a performance transcend acting to become legendary risk taking. Charlize Theron does this, with a vengeance, she has gone from being a gorgeous, very good actress, to a screen legend.  Good for her.",9,0,0,30 December 2003
Spider-Man 2," Classic Storytelling and comic books. It CAN BE DONE. (one spoiler)
","I liked the first Spider Man, I thought it was handled very well, but when I went to see Spider Man 2 - I was totally blown away.  First of all, the story --- a magnificently structured screenplay that hit all the right notes.  Who says that great action films are made in the action sequences? The reason why the action sequences in this film were so fantastic, was because the characters were so fully drawn out, given time to develop, and it gave us time for us to developed a sense of them, caring about them, and then, the action sequences hit.  Such amazing moments. The acting is top notch, especially Tobey Mcguire, who endowed the character with such depth of feeling.Ever the skeptic, I kept hinting at moments that would go wrong. At times, when the screenwriter would take the cliche way out. But then, something happen, the moment right after the action sequence in the train, a moment when the passengers hold on to spidey, and pull him inside, and a man says 'he's just a kid.' ---I don't mind saying, that I breathed deeply and tears rolled down my eyes. Why? because for one second, Sam Raimy, let me see the heart of the movie. Underneath this glossy, special effects action filled movie, there's something that is all too lacking in the comic book film adaptations that I have recently seen, and that's a heart as big and as deep as a child's imagination.",9,0,0,26 July 2004
Alexander," Alexander less Great/Less Filling
","With apologies to Angelina Jolie (who was trapped and did her best in this film. I would like to believe that... although, Angelina, it's getting a little hard to keep defending your choices.)Wow, who would think that a movie about a 20 something, bisexual over achiever, with a HOT MOM, would be this boring and funny at the same time. I tell you one thing, The screenwriters of the film have a real ear for comedy. Too bad they were writing a DRAMA! I guess for me, after realizing how bad it was gonna be --- I was missing some things, like a good musical number, or more physical comedy to liven up the entire thing. Somewhere along the line, the pie in the face bit was cut and no one was consulted.But seriously folks, when Stoney set out to make this epic, he didn't think he was gonna end up writing one of the best comedies of the year. I think it should indeed be nominated in the BEST COMEDY/MUSICAL category of the Golden Globes. But imagine how funny the movie itself would have been if he indeed used some of the more comically agile actors of our time.here's a sample cast:1. Alexander - Madonna 'Conquer your FEAR! and I'll let you know the secret of how this blond conquered the world, it's called... MARKETING.'2. Olympias - Jennifer Lopez 'The World is MINE, i mean, yours, yours, but seriously does my butt look too big in this robe...' 3. Philip - Bernie Mac 'A king isn't born until i slap him upside the head.'4. Hephastion - Sean Hayes aka Jack from Will and Grace 'Look at MEEEE! I'm dating the conqueror of the World.'5. Roxxanne - Megan Mullaly aka Karen of Will and Grace- 'Oh, honey, I was so drunk when you conquered persia, I don't even remember.'",3,0,1,26 November 2004
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Send in the Clones
","send in the clones. don't worry they are here! And there is something that people don't know about Clones.  They are a bore.  This has been one of the few movies in my lifetime, where I wanted my money back at the end. Actually I would have appreciated if someone had offered me some money for sitting through this piece of ill conceived projected celluloid.  I refuse to call it a film or a  movie. I mean, I usually find something positive about every movie I've ever seen. 'Teen Witch' had the musical number,  'Speed 2' had a really nice boat.  But I have seen great special effects before.  with the advent of computers, great special effects are nothing new.  But did everyone in Hollywood forget that the greatest special effect, the hardest to pull off, is a great story, with great characters.  Come on GEORGE!  get it together or get out of the business.",1,1,3,6 August 2003
The Aviator," Fly Away, Fly Away
","The Aviator is a good movie. and I guess what upsets me is that It should have been a GREAT MOVIE. It stumbles and falls so far away from Greatness that it leaves me yearning for the great movie that it could have been.I'm not gonna repeat the plot, it's a basic bio-pic, in which Leonardo DeCaprio SHINES as Howard Hughes. It's his performance that holds the movie together.If anything, I find most fault in the SCREENPLAY by JOHN LOGAN which was LAZY and un-layered. In John Logan's world people just don't suffer complexities, they fall easily into Hollywood archetypes --- the fighter, the dreamer, the risk-taker, each of these Howard Hughes get a scene. But none of these traits come together to give him a three-dimensional personality. John Logan is a good writer, he can spin a good line, but he can't string together plot, or character complexities to save his life. Martin Scorcese is a master, YES. Goodfella's was AWESOME, I even loved, THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, one of my favorite films. But with Gangs of New York, and The Aviator, he seems to be trying to HARD. Martin Scorcese is a MASTER, YES, but in The Aviator he is not masterful. He does not strive to give us a great film. just a great looking film.The idea of a RICH MAN with a DREAM that goes on to make his Dream happen in itself is not very exciting. I mean, he is after all A RICH MAN, it's very easy to make your DREAMS COME TRUE when you have all those resources. So, his fears, his phobias, and his psyche, all the things that would have made a great bio-pic are in the end only merely mentioned and never fully explored and this is why the film never delivers on its promise.All in all, The Aviator, however, still works. It has very little emotional impact. But damn, it's sure a pretty picture to look at.",4,2,3,24 January 2005
The Patriot," Braveheart LITE
","This film is somewhat thrilling, and at the same time empty.  It has no historical significance, except for maybe our ability to turn our history into pop corn entertainment.  What I found truly fascinating was, how similar to Braveheart the film felt and looked.I think this is a fun movie, like Terminator is a fun movie.  And it's action packed, so there's no complaint there.  But I think we're still far away from making a great film about our fight for independence.",6,0,1,4 July 2003
The Little Mermaid," Once in a Lifetime.
","Movies for the most part are entertainment.  That is all they are meant to be.  A few times in your life, just at the right time, just when you are at a turning point --- a movie comes along that mirrors your own emotions, your own angst, and your own sense of self.  if this movie comes along just at the right moment, then the movie transcends entertainment and becomes an experience.The Little Mermaid, was an experience for me.  I sometimes think I may have been a little older than most people who it was meant for. But it's idea, of finding a place where you belong, of being part of something special, whether be it love, or something else was in line with my particular growing pains at the time.The movie's characters, both Ariel and Prince Eric had a common bond, in that they wanted to surpass everyone's expectations of them, and they did. When I saw the movie, I was also going through that.Never mind that this film is a CLASSIC. Perhaps one of the top 10 animated films ever made, I find it has a much deeper heart than Beauty and the Beast, and although it signified the beginning of a brand new Disney Empire, I find that it also signified the end of it.  A film like this, can be imitated but it can never be duplicated.  And animation has grown into a magnificence and technologically superior story telling medium.  But what the Little Mermaid had, it's still to be re-captured, and that's a heart as big and as deep as the ocean.",9,0,2,9 July 2003
Good Will Hunting," and now, ABC After school special presents.
","So many fans, so little to show for it.  I know, I know, these words are gonna find me in a great minority.  A lot of people really liked Good Will Hunting.  But seriously please, great film making, not even close, and let's put the blame where it belongs...  in the writing.Now, I know they won an oscar for it, and boy did they look good emoting on the screen.  But Good Will Hunting is an ABC after school special with lots of cursing in it, and a slightly bigger budget.What this movie does show, is the brilliance of Harvey Weinstein and Miramax Pictures. Mr. Weinstein could take manure, feed it to you, and make you believe your eating bon bons.  And that's exactly what the studio did with the film. They created such high faluttin buzz around it, that people believed, and wanted to believe it so much --- that they saw brilliance where there was none.Now, I know some people think it's a great movie, I don't think it's a horribly bad movie, I like to compare it to more in the middle of the road movies, and also to some great Made for TV movies (although, not HBO films, HBO films are unusually better than Good Will Hunting would ever be.) It's just a nice, little film, with some good performances, Robin Williams was not good in it, they just gave him the oscar cause the'd been itching to do it for a while.  And of course, the Miramax public relations machine secured Ben and Matt their screenwriting oscar... but come one people... there's better movies out there thatn GWH.",1,82,188,18 July 2003
Million Dollar Baby," Million Dollar Baby
","I hated Mystic River, I really did, I spoke against it like it was the worst movie of the YEAR, the decade, the century. I was just not a fan of the screenplay, although the performances were flawless. What can I say? Clint Eastwood is a guy that does not compromise. He will make movies that you either love or you hate, yet they will have their impact. As much as I hated Mystic River, I LOVED MILLION DOLLAR BABY. Million Dollar Baby is by far the most brutally honest film I have seen since Monster's Ball or even Requiem for a Dream. It does not apologize, it does not seek to swerve the viewer, it is just an honest depiction of life and the choices you are forced to make in the process.It was not a manipulative movie at all, in a year of manipulative movies like Passion of the Christ, I found Million Dollar Baby to hold a higher bar for itself than what the rest of Hollywood is putting out there.But the reason I loved this movie is because it forced me to come to terms with myself. There is a twist, a twist much discussed by the media, and ruined by Michael Medved (or as I call him Middle Ages Medved, really does this guy live on a completely different time line than the rest of us.) When I left the film, I did not like or respect myself as a person, because I found myself siding with Hillary Swank's character, Like her, I am a strong individual when I want something, but when dealt a bad hand I am positively sure that I would make the same choices she did. That realization has been gnawing at me for three weeks since I saw this film. This film stays with you, it keeps you up at night, it makes you think, it makes you re-evaluate your choices.The film is a hot potato with the disabled right now, but they fail to see that the film is about one person's choices, in a culture where we love our movies to reflect the masses rather than the individual, people cannot see the forest for the trees. This film is a wake up call for film makers. It is a wake up call for all story tellers. And I'm so glad that a man that would normally be at the end of his career is the one to point the way.Million Dollar Baby is a classic. It is a classic Now, and it will be a classic 100 years from now. How many films made in the last ten years can you say that about? Not many.",10,8,15,10 February 2005
Big Fish," Sleeping with the Big Fishes
","I couldn't wait to see Big Fish, A nightmare Before Christmas is one of my all time favorite movies, which is why I was so disappointed by the over long, dull, sometimes magical, but often misbegotten story that these actors were forced to partake in.From time to time a magical moment will arise, and then the film seemed to be about to take off only to be pulled in, sometimes even crash back to a story that is so thin, I could not believe they stretch the subject for a decent short film to a two hour yawn-a-thon.For me Big Fish was the disappointment of the year because, it seemed to be all promise, but the promise never quite delivered. This sweet film, left me feeling pretty sour about film making that depends on no plot, no story, no performance but that of the pretty visuals.",5,3,7,13 January 2004
The Last Samurai," Everything everyone says it is... BUT...
","The Last Samurai is everything everyone says it is. Exhilarating, poetic, beautiful to look at, it is like a painting in a canvas, that you look at and wonder at the technique of the artists.  The problem is that I never stopped looking at the technique, I never got involved in the story.  I was not swept away by the directing, rather, forced along...  I really can't put my finger on why it was that I didn't love this movie. Although I did love the battle sequences OH BOY!I am a fan of Tom Cruise, have always been, but I just didn't quite buy him in this role.  He was servicable, he was fine, but he was not the actor for the job.  I kept thinking about the wonderful things Russell Crowe could have done with this role.  And that's when it hit me.  I have seen this movie so many times over the last couple of years.  BRAVEHEART, GLADIATOR, CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON, This movie follows a formula which I like to call, the 'Let's go for a best picture nomination FORMULA'...I do think it's one of the top ten movies of the year. Simply because of the way it portrays it's Japanese characters.  Still --- when it's all said and done.  I walked out of the film feeling a little cheated by the experience. I felt like the director, designer and cinematographer were saying... LOOK OVER HERE! aren't I GREAT!!!! everything was individually great, it just never came together as a complete film for me.",4,0,2,4 December 2003
Mystic River," a murky river indeed
","The great thing about Mystic River is the actors, dealing with some marginally good directing and a horrible script full of coincidences and synchronicities that even the Greek gods of drama would have trouble explaining.The trouble is that the director, Clint, truly believes he has created a masterpiece.  The commercials now, in time for Oscars, have him commenting about the lack of special fx's and how that truly makes the film greater than maybe Lord of the Rings.The problem is, that it has no special fx's whether it be digital or storytelling whatsoever.  It reminded me of a bad off-Broadway play that runs on a showcase contract and garners good reviews for its cast. Other than that, it has nothing special about it.  The greatest special fx to me is the story and this story is so convoluted, so built to give each actor one great scene, that I was tired, and drained and well predictably bored.I sat down with my friend and about 20 minutes into the movie, we made a list, and said, let's see how many actors get an Oscar clip scene and sure enough everyone got one. The fact of the matter is that this movie was purposely done for Oscars.  It also happens to be done for the Hollywood industry who love to be led to 'insight' by the hand, rather than actually have to think about anything.Mystic River is far from being the best picture of 2003.  Lord of the Rings is marginally a much better film, but hey, has anybody seen American Splendor? Or even Thirteen?",3,8,12,26 January 2004
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," A Galaxy stuck in the 70's
","Clearly there are movies that define their eras.  Star Wars, is a 70's movie, that relates well to other time periods, while at the same time losing meaning as time goes by.  it doesn't help that George Lucas has decided to ruin the meaning of his film, by adding the first three chapters --- which take the mystery away from BOOK 4 and takes away from the joy of the subsequent films.I never understood the great hoopla behind this film.  I first saw it in college, but I felt, that although okay, it was not great science fiction. and although I do appreciate that the film was the 'thing to do' in 1977, I don't think it held any special meaning to me in 1996.Great Science Fiction fascinates, it asks unanswerable questions. This is not Science Fiction, it is Fantasy, and as a Fantasy piece, it has been replaced by The Lord of the Rings as the best Fantasy movie series out there.  I'm sure The Lord of the Rings will be seen as a turn of the 21st Century film, that clearly only speaks to that era --- but that's the way it is.  Star Wars is a great movie. Just not one of the true greatests.",6,1,8,1 August 2003
