Hereditary," I AM SHOOK
","Wow. I mean WOW. Hereditary was a very hyped movie and my expectations were very high but for the first time I felt like the movie fully met my expectations and was even better than what I imagined.
NEGATIVES
For me there're really not much to say about the flaws of the movie. Maybe it is very disturbing at some points and it has some weird are freakish scenes but to me it wasn't that negative because they contribute to the better understanding of the movie and after all Hereditary is a horror movie and this shouldn't really come as a surprise. Although I think Alex Wolff did a good job in most of the movie there were a scene or two where his acting has leaning more to ridiculous than realistic, of course that's only my impression.
POSITIVES
The first half of the movie is flawless to me. It builds tension and gives us useful information and hints in order to be able to follow what's coming in the second half. Also as much as it concerns the first half the twist was amazing and certainly not predictable so early in the movie at least. The plot leads perfectly to that twist and the scene that it happens is perfectly executed in every way. Now for the second part: It follows the consequences of the twist mentioned before (which I don't want to reveal because the movie is totally worth watching and I don't want to ruin it). During that half the movie evolved from the original and disturbing horror movie that it was to a more cliche and classic horror movie per say but let me explain. When you first see the second half of the movie especially towards the end you will probably ask yourself questions like: 'what in the name of God is going on here?', 'I am completely lost', 'okay this is very weird' but when the credits start to roll and when you start processing what you just saw and taking all these little details that were given to you throughout the whole movie under consideration you will realize that everything that was shown makes perfect sense and that the movie's transition from alternative to classic was not only acceptable but also necessary. If you are confused make sure to make a little research about the movie in order to better understand these things that you maybe missed. It's really important to be able to understand the whole point of the movie since it can be interpreted both literally and symbolically- and I know- the movie is not the easiest to follow but everything you need to know it's there. Also most of the performances were flawless and I really like the symbolism behind Ari Aster's directing work.
CONCLUSION
For me Hereditary was a nearly perfect movie. Although it left me with a very strong and positive impression when I first saw it I really needed to think and research about it in order to fully appreciate it. It might seem weird with the first look but it makes A LOT of sense more than most movies do and for that it requires us to see beyond the haunting pictures and more deeply into the plot. So yeah, I totally recommend it to the lover's of the genre mostly, I am not sure that it would be pleasant enough to people that are not used into watching horror movies. Anyway everything said is my humble opinion and there will be people who will disagree with it but as much as I'm concerned GO WATCH IT.
MY RATING:10/10",10,1,2,25 July 2018
Us," Why all this hate?
","I watched Us without any particular expectations, since I thought that Jordan Peele's previous movie: Get Out was kind of mediocre. I was in the mood for a horror movie so I decided to give this movie a go, without being aware of the reviews or the rating. Had I known how much people hated it I would have changed my mind about watching it but I'm glad I didn't read them. The movie had me surprised and I can confidently say that I really enjoyed it.
PROS
The movie is packed with a great cast,a very creepy score and an interesting plot. Us is not something you see everyday since it's not your typical supernatural horror flick and to me this is really important since I am getting so tired of watching movies with similar plots (something that is pretty much what you get when you are looking for something in the horror genre) and I really appreciate when writers put some extra effort to give you something original. The movie has some solid scares, good action and an upredictable plot so it was pretty exciting and fun to watch.
CONS
I really don't have much negative to say. Maybe I got a little tired towards the end but then again I found the ending pretty rewarding so it didn't bother me that much. The movie is not very easy to understand so there is a possibility that you feel a little lost especially in the end.
CONCLUSION: The movie is an original and decent horror movie with a lot of depth and meaning. It takes a little research and thought to fully appreciate it. Having read a few theories myself I can tell you that I really respect Peele's work and his effort to make a point and throw some symbolism in a horror movie since it's not something that really happens in most hollywood productions. But even if you just stick to the surface and don't want to make any additional research the movie still makes sense and it is absolutely entertaining and worth watching.

"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Unusual but AWESOME
","We saw a lot of great movies in 2017 and I can confidently say that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is one of them. Written and directed by Martin McDonagh the movie is a winner in every category . It's original, it has great performances and a plot full of brutal, funny and sad moments. It's balance of humor, violence and drama is remarkable and not easy at all to find in today's movies. The real asset of this movie though is Frances McDormand. She plays a non likable and very complex character and delivers one of the greatest performances I have ever seen. She manages to make you like and fully understand a violent character, basically the 'villain' of the movie something that I have experienced very few times and that's one of the reasons I gave the movie 10 stars. The truth is ,not everyone can appreciate and understand the bizarre style of the movie and I am very disappointed to see that this movie is hated by a lot of people. Love it or hate it there is no denying that Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri is a unique movie and definitely something that you don't see everyday. I believe though that even more people are going to love it and that's the reason I decided to write this review. To maybe push people to watch it and see with their own eyes McDonagh's great achievement.",10,4,8,21 January 2018
Bird Box," A decent horror movie
","When I watched the trailer I knew I had to watch Bird Box right away, since it seemed like an interesting movie with an original plot. I think this was pretty much what I got even though it had its flaws.
PROS: It's definitely not a waste of time and no one can deny that it has a good main story and a higly respectable cast. It is packed with action and the plot unravels pretty well so the two hours pass pretty quickly.
CONS:
It uses many horror movie cliches and there are times it gets predictable. Also if you ask me it could have used it's cast a little bit better considering that some good actors don't get a respectable amount of screen time. Plus the ending was a little bit dissapointing at least for me.
IN CONCLUSION: It's a very respectable movie. It DOESN'T imitate 'A Quiet Place' and if it wasn't for some cliches the movie could be considered just as great if not better. I think that it is totally worth watching and it definitely deserves a spot on your watchlist.",7,1,5,26 December 2018
Dunkirk," Quite disappointing
","I have watched quite a few Christopher Nolan's movies and most of them were great so my expectations for Dunkirk was very high since the reviews are so positive. What I saw though was a documentary not a movie. The movie itself barely has any dialogues and most of it, is just a depiction of the events that happened. It was very pleasing to the eye but if you are enjoying Nolan's movies for their brilliant scripts and and stunning visuals effects you will be half satisfied : The characters have no background there are no clear protagonists and there is zero plot Since Interstellar was the last Christopher Nolan's movie I watched, this one left me very disappointed. Love it or hate it Dunkirk is a movie that you don't forget easily. If you love documentaries this one will seem like a masterpiece in the genre but it is not for you if you are looking a dramatic movie about WWII this one will seem completely emptym",7,2,7,7 September 2017
Climax," I guess you can call this movie 'Requiem for A Dream but without great acting, meaningfull scenes and good music'.
","I was looking for something intense to watch, something scary and disturbing that would make me think and I wouldn't forget as soon as the credits rolled. Climax is sure one of those movies but not in a good way I'll tell you that. The thing is the pace is terrible and by that I mean that the first half of the movie is so unbelievably boring and meaningless, full of scenes of people dancing and talking about sex, drugs and gossip that it makes you angry. I felt so tempted to give up on the movie during the first 45 minutes but I decided to stick on it since I was assuming that some action was building up and I was right. The second half is full of desturbing scenes of people doing crazy and violent stuff, blaming eachother, dancing (again), screaming (all in all it's a complete mess). I really enjoy intense movies but this is something else. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for the simple reason that the first half is boring and the second half is so disturbing that it's impossible to go through without cringing to the whole craziness of it all. If you hate yourself and you want to watch something that is going to make you feel terrible and empty then watch this movie. Also if you have any friends who think drugs are cool I recommend you make them watch it because after this they're going to change their mind. I do not regret watching it the first time but it was not a fun experience and I don't think I could ever watch it again. Not for the faint hearted and if you are looking for something intense and shocking better skip the first half.",6,1,3,7 April 2019
Hidden Figures," Met every expectation
","Hidden figures is a great movie that focuses on the untold story of three intelligent women behind NASA's missions. When I first heard about the plot I did not expect anything less from what I saw. Full of heartwarming ,humoristic and dramatic moments the movie satisfies pretty much everyone. All the members of the cast give excellent performances , making the viewer feel more attached to the characters and understand the messages that the movie is trying to pass. It doesn't have unnecessary details like most of the movies in this genre and it remains entertaining and interesting until the end. Totally recommend it!",9,1,5,14 June 2017
It Chapter Two," Good enough I guess
","Look, It Chapter Two is probably not going to blow your mind but it's not going to disappoint you either. There is a lot of hype for this movie and the trailers and everything made it seem such as the movie would be a lot better than it actually was, I assume that's the whole point of promotion, but considering that the first movie fully met my expectations I would have expected something a little better (I'll explain).
Pros
The acting is great and the casting is flawless. All the actors are a perfect match to their children predecessors and they approach their parts with respect towards the characters we all met and loved as kids. It has some very good moments with creepy jumpscares and wacky characters and achieves to balance between comedy and horror. As an ending to the whole it 'franchise' it's what you would expect without any unpleasant surprises and it's going to leave you satisfied and kind of nostalgic.
Cons
I personally didn't like the backstory that wad given to 'It' and they way they suggested would be right to defeat it, although I haven't read the book and I don't know if that kind of material was included in the original story. 3 hours was too long for this movie and it made me a little tired towards the end. I also didn't love the cgi, I have the feeling the the previous movie had used better effects.
Conclusion
'It Chapter Two' is a solid conlclusion to the story and it has the thrills to excite horror movie enthusiasts. The cast has chemistry which makes the movie even better and if you loved the first movie then it's worth your time but don't expect to get the same feeling with the original.

Arrival," Excellent!
",Arrival is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The brilliant plot and talented director and actors make every moment of this movie interesting and entertaining for every movie lover. Although the movie belongs in the science fiction genre it is very clever and seems so realistic that it makes you think that the events that are taking place are possible. I totally recommend it to everyone that loves dramas but doesn't mind to watch a movie with an original and venturous plot.,10,3,9,26 May 2017
Marriage Story," I have no idea why but this movie is amazing!
","Where do I start? I can't find a single flaw in this movie,, everything is absolutely great: The performances, the dialogues, the music, the characters and the way the director can make a movie that is just about a couple getting a divorce so damn interesting to watch. I really had very low expectations before going to see it because I was absolutely sure that I was going to be bored to death since there wasn't really any plot in it but I was dead wrong. Despite not having anything too exciting happening the movie is very pleasant to watch and I enjoyed every minute. Maybe it's due to the fact that it has a lot of dialogues and it doesn't feel slow or the brilliant performances of the protagonists. Either way I don't think that anyone is going to be disappointed after watching it. I totally recommend it!",10,0,1,15 December 2019
Mother!," Masterpiece!
","Darren Aronofsky's Mother! is a true cinematic masterpiece. Let's start from the basics: The movie's character is mainly symbolic which means that by itself it might not make a lot of sense but once you understand what the movie is trying to tell you will start loving it. I am not going to tell, you how I interpreted because I don't want to spoil anything but its secret meaning is very obvious if you ask me. The actors give great performances and you literally feel the emotions of 'her' as the movie goes on. For me Mother! was an amazing experience not only because I was mostly living and not just watching the movie but also because the movie stayed with me long after its end and its horrific but beautiful messages still torture my mind. I understand people who say that the movie was bad I can admit that it is not easy to watch due to some gruesome imagery and its chaotic atmosphere but if your heart is strong enough you will absolutely love it like I did!",10,1,8,8 December 2017
