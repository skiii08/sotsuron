It," A truly awful film that must rank as one of the worst Stephen King films.... ever!
","A really awful film with an awful story-line. The original film was miles better and I am shocked at the rating it has received on IMDb, really shocked. The acting was terrible and the children's acting was atrocious which leads me to suspect that they were either related to the director or a huge amount of nepotism occurred. The children had no clue how to act and the story line was boring, bland and empty, the effects were not there, there was nothing thrilling or exciting, nothing to do any of the things that should be expected from an overrated film like this. Really disappointed and absolutely recommend that this is a film 'NOT TO WATCH'. Give this a miss and watch the original or read the book. OMG - Just can't get over the crappy child-acting! My kids do better when they want something! I can't believe I actually watched this all the way through :(",1,5,8,30 October 2017
Hereditary," A very good film - some awful acting from many of the cast... but not Toni!
","A really good film and I think that this is one of Toni's most excellent acting. It was superb acting from her.... but Gabriel's role in the film was very weak. Why didn't he stand by his wife? In fact, I think he was miscast, as was her son. His acting was wimpish and amateurish. Nepotism from the director??? Now, Milly. I can't see why people rave on about her. Totally crap acting and unfortunately, she is not acting material. I don't think that she should have been cast in the film at, all... in any film actually! The best bit was when her head was chopped off because that was, in essence, the last time we would be seeing her. Whenever we/I saw her, I thought, OMG, why has she been given a role in this film? Very, very likely, nepotism again! But overall, a good film, much better that the usual horror films we're being given to watc.",7,0,1,25 August 2018
Bird Box," Don't know what I just watched...
","Absolute tosh... Not even a film, probably a B or C 'TV movie'... How can this be classed as horror or sci-fi... you didn't see any of the baddies, it wasn't explained how these baddies turned up, it didn't explain/show what the aim of he baddies was... It was boring and unexciting. The characters in the house were ridiculous and it was a like a failed attempt to get people of different qualities in a house to see how they would interact with each other. The gay guy and a husband, a neighbour suing them, an old woman whose presence was puzzling, the young guy and woman who bonked, the black guys, just a big mess of messy people. The little girl's acting by the way was good. The whole plot was ridiculous bordering on the impossible. I don't mean the baddies, I mean the actions of the people. For example, walking blindfolded in a forest, sailing 50 odd hours down a river, blindfolded... yeah right! Who the hell calls their kids 'Boy' and 'Girl' for 5 years and right at the end, she decides to name them... Give me a break!Now 'A Quiet Place' that was film... and I think this is the film that people would immediately think about (or compare to) when watching this film. That film was good and the writer must have had this in mind. He failed mizzzerableeee!I normally love Sandra Bullock's films but I gave this a 1. Sorry Sandra!",1,163,320,21 December 2018
The Revenant," An excellent film
","A really great film. The filming was great and you could feel virtually every emotion the actors were going through. Tom Hardy was superb, miles better than Di Caprio who is a vastly over-rated sissy actor. He had a great role in the film but, as usual, he is always mis-casted. Casting a pretty sissy boy in a real man's role was a mistake. For me, Tom Hardy was the best. A greatly superior actor and he would have been ideal for the main role.Oh, before I forget, the bear attack was superb!",8,0,0,9 May 2020
It Chapter Two," Got to give this a well-deserved... 1
","Another load of crap basically. The previous, updated It (one) was full of awful child actors who had no idea how to act. This sequel is full of overacting (except Jessica Chastain, of course) whose lines were so childish and... simple... or even cartoon-like script. This is no movie! This is some dirt that someone has scraped off the pavement (Gary Dauberman is the guilty party here) and served to a gullible public.
I tried to like this film (after trying to watch it twice) but each time I just switched off and thought, Nah, this is just rubbish. Even though Stephen King is vastly overrated, I thought maybe a Setphen King sequel not written by him might be good... but nah... this is bad, really bad. Not even a B class TV movie, nor C, nor D... you know what I mean?!",1,2,2,11 January 2020
Annihilation," An immensely boring film
","I have been waiting months to watch this film. It was a great disappointment. There was nothing exciting about the film whatsoever and the plot was extremely weak, with the storyline not explaining much, especially at the end. The graphics were mediocre, the acting was cr*p, the script was simply awful, and the ending was a WTF happened moment. This WTF moment for me was 'Did I really just waste nearly 2 hours watching this?'... 'Yep, sure did!'",3,0,2,15 March 2018
Sully," Overrated but watchable
","The film started off OK but as the story developed, if was very slow and boring. I did watch it to the end because I always likes to see how the underdog beats the powerful opposition which, in this case, were investigators who had already made up their minds that the two pilots were 'guilty'. However, in the final part of the film, I found that the woman investigator's actions wrong and, IMO, she and her colleagues should have been investigated for ignorance and contempt. Why??? Well had Sully not questioned the number of times the pilots practiced their run, the investigation would have found them guilty. However, because Sully did question this, the simulator was rerun with new parameters and the pilots were then found to have acted correctly.... WHICH brings to me to my point. The investigator (Anna Gunn) then had the nerve and audacity to say that she had never met a pilot like Sully, his actions were heroic and so on. So either her views changed within about 30 seconds (which I severely doubt), or she knew he was heroic from the beginning but continued along her path of scapegoating etc. with her other investigator colleagues. So if the did indeed say those words then she/they should be investigated and if it was just artistic Hollywood licence, then it was really OTT.",4,9,18,3 December 2016
