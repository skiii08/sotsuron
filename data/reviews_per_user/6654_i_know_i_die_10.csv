"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," You'll laugh so hard till you drop
","When we talk about Hugo Weaving, we always talk about his famous roles like Agent Smith, V or Elrond. This is Hugo Weaving before he was Smith and he is playing as a drag queen. No kidding, he's playing a drag queen! Not only you get to see Hugo Weaving as a drag queen but also Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp. They're all playing drag queen. Now how often do we see Hollywood actors playing as a drag queen? Mitzi (Weaving), Felicia (Pearce) and Bernadette (Stamp) decides to go for a performance in a Hotel. They travel on bus across the desert and it breakdown in the middle of nowhere. They discovered that the owner for the hotel they are performing for is owned by Mitzi's wife. They soon meets Bob who help them fix the bus. They bring him along on their journey to fix the bus. Soon they made it to the hotel and Mitzi finds out that he has a son and he doesn't want his son to know what he is working as.This is a wonderful sing-a-long movie with lots of laugh out loud jokes. I watched this movie once and I've already end up singing along with the movie. The soundtrack of the movie is great. Lots of famous songs like 'Mamamia' or 'I Will Survive'. This is a soundtrack worth buying. The characters are well crafted and the acting is brilliant. It is so good and so believable they deserve a best actor award.The camera works are simple but great. It matches well for the film. The editing is great for some of the scenes like the performances scenes. The art direction for this film is excellent. The costume for the performance scenes are well done. The script is well written with lots of jokes that can make you laugh till you drop. You will not get bored of the jokes.I hardly watch movies about drag queen and I'm not really a fan of it but after watching this movie, I like it even if it is not my cup of tea. Fans of Hugo Weaving, Guy Pearce and Terence Stamp must watch this film to believe it. If you are looking for some good laugh this is strongly recommend. Drag queens have never look this good.",8,8,11,23 August 2007
Spider-Man 3," The Wait For The Spider Is Over
","Most of us have been waiting for Spider-Man 3 for months since it was first announced. Now after 2 years since Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3 is here. We've seen the trailer time after time and we're still not bored about it. Why? Because the first two Spider-Man were great and we all love the friendly neighbor hood Spider-Man.When I first saw the trailer I was blown away by the CGI on Sandman. Green Goblin...I mean New Goblin suit is cool although he looks nothing like a goblin. And then trailer after trailer they finally showed Vemon and well...he looks kind of small. And finally, I went to watch Spider-Man 3.I'll try to make this short. The story goes like this. Peter Parker/Spider-Man is still protecting the city and now he finally wanted to pop the question to Mary Jane. Later out of no where New Goblin came and attack Peter. Then Ben Parker actual killer became sandman and terrorize the City. Then an alien came to earth and takes over Peter and Peter became more powerful, then a photographer, Eddie Broke, is threatening Peter's job and Peter is stuck in the middle of Mary Jane and Gwen Stacy.The story is great and it's slightly longer then the first two. Great CGI here. CGI on Sandman blown me away with all those Sand. The action sequence are well planned and beautiful shot and CGI-ed. Vemon is well CGI-ed but still he is still small in size But great work anyway. Everything in this movie is well made. Great script, camera movement, sound, CGI, Director, etc.A must watch for Mavel fans/Spider-Man fans. You'll have to watch it to believe it. It will probably end up as one of the biggest hit in 2007. So don't miss it.",10,0,1,18 May 2007
Watchmen," We Watches the Watchman
","The long awaited Graphic Novel is finally here on the big screen. Some might hate it, some might love it. But this one is one not to be miss for all films fans out there. Don't go in and expect a big time Superman or Spider-Man movie because you will only come out with a big disappointment. This is not your average super hero movie. This is about war and the violence we cause. And it's the Watchmen who tries to bring peace by doing justices.It all begins with an awesome fight sequences where the Comicdian gets murdered. Rorschach, a mask vigilant, goes on to investigate the murder. Later, more of them starts to get murdered. Silk Spectre goes to look for Nite Owl because she had an ague with Dr. Manhattan who later got blame for spreading cancer and went exile. Soon Silk Spectre starts and Nite Owl starts to love each other and they team up with Rorschach to find out what's happening.Fans of the comic might be a little disappointed with the film because there are some major changes in the comic and movie. Although even if it doesn't live up to the comic it is still a great Graphic Novel movie to enjoy with some great direction from Zack Snyder and his Slow motion sequences. With the mix of a wonderful soundtrack. And my favorite scene in the whole film is the beginning where the Comicdian gets murdered and they have the song 'Unforgettable' playing in the background.The Characters are all well portrayed by the cast. They're dark, some of them are so called insane, like Rorschach. The comicdian jut enjoy killing everyone. Great job to Billy Crudup who played Dr. Manhattan. The cast are all well picked to portray the roles. Patrick Wilson does look like Dan Dreiberg or Nite Owl.This is a film fans of the comic would enjoy. And after all those legal issue, is this worth the wait? I would say Yes. This is worth the wait. This is worth the watch. This is one most will be re watching over and over again.Overall 4/5 Stars",8,5,11,28 March 2009
American History X," On my top 10 Gangster Film
","One thing about gangster movie is that the main character is always the bad guy. But yet we always feel sorry for them. Remember Scarface? Anyway American History X tells a story about a skinhead, Derek, who was asked to start a gang who are against people with different skin color. So they go and trash a supermarket own by an Asian. One night, tow African American decided to steal Derek's car because of some problems with each other. His brother, Danny, saw it and told Derek and Derek came out with a gun and killed them. Derek was caught, went to prison and then Danny decided to follow Derek's footsteps. When Derek came out of prison, he acts differently and he wants to stop the madness. And to protect his Family especially Danny.It's good to watch a gangster film where the gangster is trying to change for the better. It has a powerful story. It tells us to respect everyone no matter what color or races they are and to be careful of who we be-friend with.Chamera angle screenplay is good. The 'past' scene also plays a good part in the film. Edward Norton did a great job bringing Derek to life. The music score fits perfectly with every scenes. It's an almost perfect film. A must watch for movie all fans.",9,0,3,28 February 2007
Saw III," A very fun flicks for Psycho People
","My favourit SAW flick of the three. It has more of the other 2. More blood, more gore. More deadly traps. They even have a fully naked lady. I don't recall one from the first 2. *Ahem* Anyway It was more bloody than the first 2.Here is a quick summary of the story. Jigsaw is dying and he kidnap a doctor to keep him alive and will be free if another person who is also kidnap complets a game.Look out for the twist and turn in the story. The Grade A gore. The 'creative' traps. The puppet and more of Amanda.If you didn't saw the first two, watch them first before you watch SAW 3. So that you can understand more about the story. So stop reading this and go watch the movie.",8,1,2,4 December 2006
City of God," Enter my top 10 easily.
","Imagine Pulp Fiction with more characters, more guns, more stories, different language, lots of gun fights and a chicken. If you love Pulp Fiction, you will love this.This movies tells the story of every character. Every story is link to something. Perfect script. Every story of the character is written perfectly. And the story is so well told you are not even sure who is the bad guy or who is the good guy. But in the end, everyone is the bad guy.This movie shows you the horror of the world we live in now. Kids walking the streets with guns in their hands. People killing people for no reason.The camera shots and editing is brilliant. The atmosphere is perfect with each scenes. The acting is great. The gun fight scenes are perfect. It is so perfect that it looks like it is taken from a real life shootout. It will put you on the edge of your seat. It is truly one of the best film of the year.

But the Silver Sufer is too powerful. So they must team up with Dr Doom to stop him.Simple story, simple script, breath-taking special effect, Mavel jokes, Stan Lee Camoe, Dr Doom, good action and an almost naked Jessica Alba.

Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," One of the best Musical Comedy to come out in years!!!
","When was the last time you saw a comedy that made you want to watch it over and over again? Now there are more crap comedy then real comedy. This isn't a comedy like those Scary Movies (1 and 2 was good, the rest are craps), Nobit (Total crap), etc. This is a musical which has some of the funniest lyrics I've seen. For all those who still don't know what Tenacious D is, it is a band which consist of Jack Black and Kyle Gass. Their songs is not exactly serious but the lyrics is so funny it's good.OK. This movie is about a boy, Jack Black/JB, who runs away from his family because they dislike rock. He goes to Hollywood and meets this guy called, Kyle Gass/KG, JB saw KG playing the guitar and was amazed. KG told JB that he is a famous rock star. so JB asked KG to be his master and everything was fine until one day where JB found out KG was a lie. Then later they become cool again and the realize that most rockers are using the same guitar pick. They go research and found out it has some power in it. And the journey begins.Jack Black best movie yet. Kyle Gass first and best movie. I love the script. Everything is so well planned. And also lots of funny scenes. Remember the part where JB is attacked by the group of gangsters you might not laugh but if you watch A Clockwork Orange, you will laugh at that scene. The music plays a big part in the movie. Fits so perfectly with the scenes. The laser scene was funny. Plus the music you will laugh till your stomach hurts.For all Tenacious D fans, this is a must watch. For all those new to Tenacious D, this is also a must watch. For people who wants to laugh. This is also a must watch. You'll probably watch this a second time or so.",9,1,2,24 March 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," Yippi Ki Yay John McClane is at it again!!!
","Die Hard is probably one of the most known action movie and Bruce Willis most famous role. I have never seen a Bruce Willis role that can influence me into speaking most of his lines in Die Hard. Die Hard 1 was a classic. 2 was a good sequel. 3 was good but not as good as the first two. And when I heard 4 is out, I thought to myself. 'How is a man who is in his 50s going to make an action movie? It's probably going to be a bad sequel.'. But I take it back. Die Hard 4 is the first runner up to Die Hard. It shows that there is still some ass-kicking in Bruce Willis. Rock on Bruce Willis! The story is simple. John McClane(Willis) is called to pick up a hacker, Matt Farell(Long). While John is talking to Matt, action starts. Then after that, a hacker(Olyphant) bring disasters to the city of D.C. And now John and Matt must stop this hacker. From here on, it is jam pack action.I love the style of the movie. A cool and fast movie. Keeps you awake even thought you are sleepy. An action/comedy script which works pretty well. The warlord(Smith) scene is my favorite. This is a very good example of a good action movie.One thing I hate is some parts are unrealistic. John McClane never seems to gets hurt. That is one thing I hate about action movies. Hero never gets hurt. And not forgetting that how damn good the villain is, he is a unless guy when facing John. Another thing action movies fail in. No matter how good the Villain is, he is unless when facing the hero. Beside all these, everything is OK.This is the best movie to come out this month. It is a tough battle between Tranformer since they have such good rating. If it is possible you can watch both movie within a day and judge it by yourself. For me? Die Hard 4.0 Yippi-Ki-Yay",8,0,2,12 July 2007
300," The Best Comic Adaption Since Sin City
","If some of you still don't know. This movie is based on a comic by Frank Miller. The comic is base on the 300 Spartans story. Frank Miller added a little magic of his on to make it more interesting. So don't expect to see a movie which is accurate History. And for those who are complaining about the background not looking real, it is because they want to make it look like a comic. It is like Sin City. Sin City is also a comic by Frank Miller. So all Frank Miller fans will love this. Anyway, they make it look like the comic. And if you are still complaining, I suggest you to go buy the novel and read it. Then watch the movie. You will then appreciate the movie.The story is like the 300 Spartans. 300 of the best vs an army of uncountable people. Only thing is that Frank Miller has added a little differences of his own. So don't expect to be surprise to see people who don't look like people in the film.I have to say this. The computer effect is damn good. The action scenes is beautiful. Adding the slow motions it is perfect. The dance of the Oracle girl is a good example. The slow motion makes it look so beautiful. The costume is beautiful. I love the Immotal costume. Props is also an important thing here. The design for the swords, armors etc is nice. The way they did Ephialtes is also nice. He really look disfigured. Queen Gorgo is beautiful. The whole film is beautiful.If you like the comic masterpiece, Sin City, you will love this comic masterpiece, 300. A must watch for all comic book/Frank Miller fans. For people who are watching this for some History lesson will be disappointed because it is not historical accurate. I said this in pathfinder and I will now say it here. It is just a movie. It don't have to be accurate.",10,0,4,29 March 2007
