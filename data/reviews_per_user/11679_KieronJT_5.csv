Skyfall," Best bond film ever
","In Skyfall we come across a very imperfect Bond, something we have been used to since Casino Royale & Quantum of Solace. Skyfall however does not carry on from its predecessors in terms of story or character building and really stands alone as an entry in the whole series.Even though the initial plan was to form a trilogy, with the Quantum organisation being the gel that helped connect all the three films, we now find Bond on the trail of a former operative who wants to bring down Mi6. An operative who makes a somewhat homoerotic entrance to say the least.Comparisons have been made between Skyfall and Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, which is apparent in the way the character of Bond and the themes normally associated with a Bond film are deconstructed and built back up again. This completely works in Skyfall as we see Bond essentially labelled as being over the hill and encouraged to step aside for a younger, better version to take his place.Where Skyfall really works for me is how it works as an intelligent blockbuster, there is no action for action's sake. The story builds up to moments where the action makes sense and you feel as if it is continuing to move the story along. Of course there's nothing wrong with a silly blockbuster to pass a few hours away, but that wouldn't have been right here. Bond needed stripping down and going back to basics.Overall I really enjoyed this version of Bond, at the moment I would say it stands as my favourite James Bond film. Any future sequel has a tough act to follow but the ground work has been laid for something special to happen.",8,2,7,4 January 2013
Wreck-It Ralph," Milk my duds, Wreck-It Ralph is brilliant
","Before I went into this film I had a feeling it was going to be good, I just didn't know how good. Honestly it's such a rarity to have high expectations for a film nowadays and have those expectations completely dwarfed by what's put in front of you.Wreck-It Ralph draws comparisons to Toy Story and it's easy to see why. It's basically has the same premise, characters that come to life once they are not being played with and no humans are around to see what they are getting up to during their 'social' hours. To me though, once the lights go out in the arcade, Wreck-It Ralph is something completely different.Our main protagonist, Ralph, is unloved and sick of his job. A job which means having to play the villain all the time. Ralph however, wants to change things and his idea of doing this is to make his way into another game and earn himself a medal to show off and earn some respect from his peers.Of course this doesn't go according to plan and Ralph's efforts end up in all kinds of destruction, interfering in not one but two new game worlds. Along the way he meets Calhoun, King Candy & the absolutely adorable Vanellope.For me, Sarah Silverman's Vanellope steals the show completely. If you don't want to pick her up and giver her a hug after Ralph has Hulk smashed an object that means the world to her then you have no heart.There are of course, many memorable characters in this film. Alan Tudyk as villain King Candy is an absolute blast, playing the character as classic comic book camp initially then moving into real vicious territory as the film moves along and his motives become clearer.The story moves along at a fair pace. Moving between different game worlds, showing us the goings on in the real world of the arcade and giving each character enough time to shine. There is rarely, if ever, a dull moment in the film. I was having enough fun at the start of the film just trying to spot all the different video game characters from my youth, that have been lovingly & brilliantly captured on-screen.I really can't recommend this film enough. It has managed to get the blend just right of appealing to both children and adults alike and must surely go down as a true Disney classic in years to come.Go watch it, now. You won't regret it, I promise.",8,2,2,19 February 2013
Mama," Don't upset Mama
","Mama begins quickly, showing us how two of our main characters, Victoria and Lilly become separated from the world and why they spend 5 years of their lives living in a deserted cabin in the woods (there's always a cabin isn't there?).Jessica Chastain plays Annabel, she plays in a band and is completely against having kids. Her boyfriend, played by Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau, has been on the search for his two missing nieces ever since they disappeared five years ago. Of course, his hard work pays off and he is finally reunited with the two girls.Mama is a somewhat old school horror. It's a ghost story that relies on scares and jumps instead of blood and guts or cheap thrills. It's similar to last years The Woman In Black in its use of scares and atmospheric tension. The constant stream of strange noises and its well handled use of special effects help to create very uncomfortable viewing at times.The scares are simple but very effective. There are some very good scenes, mostly involving Jessica Chastain, which create genuine fright in the audience.Mama is not without its faults though. There are moments that are meant to scare but instead brought out fits of laughter from the audience, particularly towards the end of the film. There is one moment of note, which I'm sure sounded great in theory, but when put on-screen it can only be compared to resembling cousin 'it' from The Addams Family.The good does outweigh the bad though. Chastain is brilliant throughout, the two young girls bring a charm and insecurity to their roles and director Andres Muschietti definitely has a knack for telling an old- fashioned ghost story.",7,1,3,20 March 2013
Jack Reacher," An old school detective thriller
","Jack Reacher is not hero, or so he would have you believe. He's a loner and he's old school. He travels from town to town, presumably via bus as he has no passport, nor does he have a phone or any other form of communication. He's a bit like Chuck Norris really, you don't find him he finds you, he can beat five guys up and barely break a sweat and he has a very strong sense of right and wrong.Now the trailer for Jack Reacher does slightly deceive the audience into thinking this is an action film, it does have action but it's actually more like an old school detective thriller, playing out at times quite slowly. As I say, Reacher does have action, just not a whole lot. This is fine though as the time in between the action allows for both the story and characters to breathe. The story is essentially quite simple, a sniper takes out five seemingly random victims with seemingly no motive or cause. Of course our hero soon gets involved and things start to unravel.Tom Cruise is very good as Jack Reacher, the whoop de doo caused by fans of the books over Cruise's lack of height never plays into it. He fully takes on the role in every department, playing a smart, charismatic, brave and even at times very funny Jack Reacher. The main villain The Zec, played brilliantly by Werner Herzog, is a very imposing character and sticks in the mind, which is quite something as he is only really given two scenes to make his mark. Jai Courtney, as secondary villain Charlie, creates a menacing character also, using his physical presence to intimidate those around him.Jack Reacher is a film and a character that stays with you long after you've watched the film. I saw it last Tuesday and there are moments I still think of now, the extremely loud car chase, the take down of five thugs, the initial sniper attack and the moving part where you we are told just how innocent the victims were.I thoroughly enjoyed watching this film, I would quite happily watch it again and I would definitely recommend it. There are sixteen other novels ready for the sequel treatment, I just hope we don't have to wait too long to see the next instalment.",7,9,14,7 January 2013
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Save me Tom Cruise!
","If you have seen any previous film starring Will Ferrell and enjoyed yourself immensely you will no doubt feel the same about Talladega Nights.Be in no doubt that this is Will Ferrell's movie. He occupies nearly every scene and absolutely steals the show. Although saying that,he is helped by a fine supporting cast. John C. Reily is always a pleasure to watch. Gary Cole is superbly cold hearted as Ricky Bobby's father, and i never knew Michael Clarke Duncan was such a good comic actor.The actual plot does not matter too much as you are really just waiting for the next comedic set piece.In a year so far, of fairly uninspiring and unfunny movies save for maybe Superman, Pirates and Snakes, Will Ferrell has come along and tickled our funny bone yet again.",7,0,1,1 October 2006
