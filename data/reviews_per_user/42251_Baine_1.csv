The Blair Witch Project," Not as original as everyone says.
","The Blair Witch Project is one of the most lame films I have seen since Godzilla. Needless to say, it does not live up to the hype. It is not scary at all unless you're afraid of tree branches and leaves. The characters are annoying as hell. (I couldn't stand Heather's insidious screaming!) By the end of the film I was routing for the Blair Witch to kill her already and give my ear drums a rest. People think this film is so original, but it's not. A film called The Last Broadcast, which finished filming in 1997, is about four filmmakers who trek into the New Jersey Pinelands in search of the Jersey Devil, another local legend. Only one comes out and the footage found is their film. The Last Broadcast was completed in July 1997, a full fifteen months before the final edit of the Blair Witch Project was completed and two years before Blair Witch came into theatres. Personally, I haven't seen the Last Broadcast, so I don't know if it's as bad as Blair Witch, but save your money. The Blair Witch Project is NOT scary and extremely boring! If you want to see a real horror film with intelligence and real scares, go see the Sixth Sense. Now, that's worth the price of admission!",Null,0,0,6 October 1999
