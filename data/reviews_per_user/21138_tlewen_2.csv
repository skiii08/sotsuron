Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Don't waist your time on this
","No, no, no, this is not a Sherlock Holmes movie. If Sherlock Holmes was an action hero, then this movie would be excellent. But Sherlock is not an action hero. He is gifted with an incredible intellect, that you virtually see nothing of in this movie. What you see a lot of is running, hitting, kicking and shooting, as well as people who don't die even after being knifed several times and falling 20 meters off a building... falling not only once, but three times. Well, I must admit that this review is based only on the first 60 minutes. I did not want to waist more of my time on this. It was already 60 too many minutes. So, don't waist your time on this, like I did.",1,21,41,29 April 2012
Bird Box," Intense and interesting throughout
","I must have been the right audience for this movie. Before watching it I read several reviews and some of them critized it for being pointless and also for being a waste of two hours. But I decided to still watch it and that was great. Why? Probably because I am a father to a two year old son that I love more than anything. So I could relate to Sandra Bullocks character throughout. The decisions she took, the dedication she showed throughout was based on the love and protection for her child and loved ones. I don't want to write more than that. I thought the movie was great thoughout. Two hours felt like one hour. It was intense and interesting. Perhaps predictable as well but for this movie I didn't mind that. My curiosity was still on the highest level throughout.One thought though is that perhaps some bad reviews comes from people watching this on a small screen. This movie is probably best viewed on a big screen with a good sound.I don't want to write reviews for good movies because I think a good movie should be seen without any previous knowledge. But since this in my opinion is underrated and many of the negative reviews will scare viewers I felt I needed to say something.",8,4,6,19 January 2019
