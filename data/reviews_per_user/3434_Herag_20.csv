The Sound of Music," This is moviemaking at its glory.
","If there is one Film that I admire for the sheer joy it brings to the viewer it has to be 'Sound of Music'. The breathtaking Cinematography that hugs the landscape so much so, I would want to spend my twilight years on this mountain!. William Wise and the writer did the scouting of the locations ( at one point Wyler was involved but he did not have taste for Musicals). Every scene is a Cinematic, Directorial brilliance, with the Casting so real and live till this date in the memory. This is one movie that is part of the growing up for the baby boomers  like me, and the other; Saturday Night fever. Even though they were worlds apart, there was a magic in these movies the great gigsaw puzzle all come together to the delight of a moviegoer that yet to be outdone.",Null,3,9,9 June 2003
Chinatown," Overrated Screenplay
","Robert Townsend is an overpaid, overrated, writer. Jack Nicholson was good and so was John Houston. Fay Dunaway was OK (she was terrific when she got slapped). The story is twisted so much so the viewer could write his own story as it happens in the movie. The ending was altered by Polanski who is another overrated director (see Barry Levinson's direction of 'Bugsy') The ending was the anticlimax and the worst ending of any movie. In the '70s, directors like Coppola and Scorsese had not made their mark and Polanksi was the one of the new kid on the block who had connections (like Evans and Nicholson),and was known as a radical director for movie like 'Rosemarys Baby'. He was embraced instantly by his cronies. These days directors like Polanski are dime a dozen and he won't make a dent in Hollywood. Its obvious that he likes stories that were weird, or socio-pathic and most of his films had shock value. With advent of TV sitcoms this value is lost to the audience. The movie is worth watching once, not ten times! like Robert Evens claims he watched it (see special features on DVD). Few scenes and few lines of dialog stand out but overall it is another good film not a great film like we are led to believe.",7,1,8,4 May 2011
Lost in Translation," Hyped up in Transition.
","I Happened to see a Rodney Dangerfield DVD with some skits by Bill Murray-I think he gave a better performance. than here. Here he is detached,stoic as his Bob Harris doing a Commercial. His performance is hyped, not an Oscar worthy material to say the least. The beginning was dark and dreary with neither the Dialog holding your attention nor the Characters well identified. The background music is subtle with a lilting song at the end but most of the time it is lifeless. I do not see any brilliance in Direction. Sophia Coppola was criticized for her acting talent in 'God Father' but I think she is better actress than a writer or a Director. If she did't have a famous last name this movie would never have garnered the attention as it has done. Johansson as Charlotte has potential but she has barely scratched it in this movie.",5,0,5,28 May 2005
The Godfather: Part II," Masterpiece of a movie.
","'The trouble with the Motion-picture Art was is it is too much an Industry and the trouble with the Motion-picture Industry is,it is too much an Art'! Enter,Francis Ford Coppola, the middle name standing for the Ford Hospital in Detroit (or for the Ford Opera) born into an Artistic family, saw Sergie Einstein's 'Ten days that shook the World' at the age of 17 on a Sunday and on Monday he wanted to make movies! and he not only made movies but Masterpieces. He simulated a 'epileptic like attack'! in front of Ruddy,Jaffe,Yablans and Evans to be selected as the Director and he got his way for Casting which is the secret to the success of the 'Godfather' series. The Screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is probably the best writing talent since both lived in New York and 'lived the life'. This is a movie that will happen once in a lifetime since there would not be another 'Coppola',there would not be another Brando,Pacino or De Niro nor the dedicated Film-makers like Evans or studios like Paramount.",10,1,4,16 April 2004
Fargo," 'I love you too Margie:' !!
","The movie is funny without trying to be funny. Steve Buscemi,as Carl is the penultimate loser among losers.He is the Laurel and the Iceman is the ultimate Hardy. The humor is in the way the talk comes across like Margie interviewing the two hookers, the cop who was called out by the guy shoveling the snow and the dialog between Carl and the iceman badguy. The few who stand out are Margie and Jerry. Now Jerry(William H. Macy,)is sometimes not convincing (very superficial) in some of the Ransom scenes with his father-in-law but he is a great actor.The humor conceals some of the brutal (supposedly real story that happeneed in Minnesota in 1997)enactments of what happened. The movie is riveting as all good movies are. Even the last few scenes where this petite and pregnant Sheriff has this monster behind barbed wires, are funny and then normnan and Margie cozy up- when he says for the final time 'I love you Margie' it does't sound so mechanical as Norman had said few times before.",Null,0,0,29 October 2008
The Aviator," The Eccentric Aviator
","The first few reels suffers from poor dialogue (in fact the dialogue and editing is poor thru out), mismatched characters. As the movie makes progress towards the end when Leonardo Decaprio sports a mustache and dissects his hair in the middle like Howard Hughes the movie begins to take shape. I don't think Ava Gardner was that close to Hughes as depicted in the movie. The only acting of repute is Leonardo's. The crash scene close to Beverly Hills and the Spuruce Goose taking off are worth the ticket. I am not too postitive about the movie..there is something lacking..editing may be or the dialogue? The dialogue is not brisk. The Senate hearings are probably the best dialogue (this may be since it was part of the public records.) Rest of the movie is second hand knowledge with only one person-a nurse-who knew much about his eccenticites which are not hilarious but genuinely bizarre--commissurate with the Genius of Hughes.",6,0,0,8 September 2010
Ocean's Eleven," A Precision flick.
","The last time I enjoyed a movie like this was when George Hamilton stole those diamonds in TopCopy and here we have a marinated Burt Reynolds a softer and gentler Sean Connery-George Clooney- as Danny Ocean stealing millions right under the nose of a Casino Moghul (loosely fashioned after Steve Wynn, who relinquished his Casino and now building a new 'Lereve' called Wynn Las Vegas) played by Andy Garcia. Steven Soderbergh is in his peak here after Traffic which looked like his experiment with direction. The only female lead acts very detached and does nothing to this movie, lesson get Je-Lo next time (may be Ben Affleck too!). The Stealer is Clooney and Garcia, Reiner,and Pitt close behind. After I see this flick I canoot wait to hop on the next Plane to Las Vegas!.",Null,0,0,30 July 2003
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Hidden torture , Coveting Dragons.
","I watched the DVD based on the review's on Netflix suffice to say that was the first and the last rental from Netflix. There are nubile young women flying on rooftops not like this is like bad, but it gets to be intimidating and reduntant after a while. Then there these old men reclining and stroking their beards talking very irreverent absurdity which translated to English even more absurd. This seem to go on till the viewer in me says 'Cut' to end the torture. This is totally overrated movie with some great Cinematography and technical talent but not enough to sustain my patience. A waste of time and money. This movie is akin to 'Beutiful Mind' where the reviews trap you into seeing a Pic. and repent later.",4,1,3,5 October 2003
The Elephant Man," A Beautiful Portrait
","There are movies that take you away into a realm of their own,into a world that existed in London-if you lived in London this is even more poignant. John Hurt is John Merrick the Elephant man-may be john Merrick reincarnated as John Hurt since no one could have a personified a disfigured,downtrodden human being that was the Elephant Man. If this movie does't bring tears then you lack the tear glands. David Lynch takes you into the life and times of John Merrick so much you want to meet him and hear him say 'My na--me-is-Jo--hn'. This is a masterpiece of movie-one of the best movies made and made anywhere that will never cease to amaze at the talent of an actor in the caliber of John Hurt. The metamorphosis of this actor is just amazing just considering the amount of time it took for this actor to transform and imitate the gait and the speech. Suffice to say this movie made more impact on me than any movie that I can remember.",9,2,2,30 March 2004
Titanic," One small step for a moviemaker, a gaint step for the Moviekind.
","A kid who was a loner and strived on doing things different and better, grew up to be an A-Director and in Hollywood, that is a great achievement just to be in that league, the man is James Cameron and the movie is Titanic.From the Screenplay to the the ultimate Audio dubbing at the Lucas's Skywalker technology park-Cameron's genius clearly shines. If there was another person who can share the credit would be James Horner. The music comes alive with the sea parting for the ocean liner. The initial departing scene in Southhamton and the the working of the engines with the sound of the pistons going fullboard 'Let us strech our legs Mr. Murdoch' is just awesome scenes to reckon with. The sea is alive with the sound of Titanic. The scene with Rose shivering on the plank of wood is probably the weakest part of Cameron's directorial brilliance. The scene is short and plastic. Gloria Stuart as the surviving 'Rose' reminds me of Katherine Hepburn in her sincere portrayal.Like 'Ben-Hur', this is a movie that will be remembered as long as the relic of Titanic remains in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.",9,1,3,16 July 2003
A Beautiful Mind," Good example of Hollywood's Decadance.
",I should have been paid to see this disguisting piece of celluloid trash. The actor never deserved the Oscar. The actor has raw acting talent-unfortunatley it is all in his biceps that comes handy with tigers in a cage. This is the beginning of the decadance for Hollywood when an award is given based on which Studio produces them. This practice is as sad and pathetic as this film.,Null,1,4,28 August 2003
There Will Be Blood," There will be Blood (and few boring scenes)
","I have seen more blood in sitcom than here..I'm sure the blood represents the feud to own the oil and the pipeline and paying the bottom line money to get it. Whole movie is Danile Day Lewis's eccentric behavior..don't ask too many questions otherwise face the consequences. Dano as Eli, is a more solemn with an incredible voice as a preacher. The story of how the wildcats got started is probably the best of the movie. It is fascinating since it is so close to the BP oil spill. Daniel Day Lewis is a good actor but there are few scenes which are too slow and redundtant-like in the restaurant..with a napkin over his head...what was that all that about? The movie is a good watch but it deserved the Oscar for the acting and Cinematography.The movie is more a directors cut than for mass consumption.",6,0,2,12 September 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," A Gem
","There are movies made for money, and yet there are movies that are made for the sake of propagating the Art of Cinema. These are movies which appear like Comets once in a Cinema lifetime, instead of doom and gloom; they uplift our sullen mood. I have never been a fan of Fiction since there is enough drama in real life.However I am an ardent fan of narrated Movies, which takes me to Scorsese and his catalog of Celluloid Classics.There was some great narrative styles in 'Good Fellas' and 'Casino', but Morgan Freeman takes narration to a newlevel. His Barry White tinged voice is one of the glues that hold this tale of a convict who has more convictions in his soul than the alleged convictions. Morgan Freeman is the finest actor in his genre. Tim Robbins as 'Andy' is one of the best performances by an actor, that I have seen lately. some of the common threads to a good movie that I have noticed is the Scriptwriter who also wields the megaphone, since this gives a edge over a director who is trying to put a face on the story. Frank Darabont has done a splendid job so much so we feel that these two Characters are alive and working on their boat in sunny Mexico. The dual talent of writing and directing is evident in the success of great Directors like Coppola, (God Father, with Mario Puzo) Scorsese.(Good Fellas, with Nicholas Pillegi). God bless these kindred since they have made some great movies and Shashank Redemtion is one of them.",10,0,1,30 April 2003
Ben-Hur," Greatest Spectacle
","When I first saw this movie on a big screen, I was so awed, I felt like I lived thru the era. This is probably the finest Motion Picture of all times. Now, If I have to pick some of the best Directors in North America-it had to be Wyler, Wise, Coppola, Scorsese, because of the sheer pre-production homework and the meticulous details, that the above directors put in. General Lew Wallace, spent 7 years under a beach tree, in Crawfordsville Indiana, in 1880, writing the book and it was triggered by a conversation on a train with an Aesthist. The role of Ben-Hur was offered to Burt Lancaster, who declined it, on moral grounds and Paul Newman declined it, since he had skinny legs to wear a Roman tunic!.The Chariot scene took five weeks to film, used 15,000 extras and filmed on 18 acres of land at Cinecitta Studio in Italy. This scene was a production unit, headed by the famous Stunt-King Yakima Canut and his son Joe Canutt who doubled for Charlston Heston. I have read about two panavision cameras placed along the path of the chariots and one was damaged but there were no fatalities in this incredible and awesome piece of action sequence. This is one movie I will never buy DVD since this should be watched in all it's regal splendor in a THX Theatre. I think every scene was memorable. It's difficult and almost cruel to pick one acting over other since this was the finest cast of acting talent put together for a movie. This is not a movie but a monumental spectacle to the collective talent and dedication to the craft that was prevalent in the 6o's, and the larger than life canvas envisioned and executed by a director-the caliber of Willima Wyler. There will never ever be a movie like Ben-Hur.",10,2,5,31 May 2003
Casino Royale," My name is Bland -----,James Bland
","Vodka Martini-Shaken or stirred? I don't care a damn! Why not? The Chase&Action Sequnce on the crane is just incredible-some of the best I have seen in a Bond Movie. So is the scene on the tarmac of the Airport. But Daniel Craig is too mechanical with no personality. He is tall and looks good in a tux-so does a penguin. There is no Villain with a bad Russian accent(Bond-do you expect me to talk? No,I expecthh you tto diiie Missta Bond,) or a bald guy in Nehru jacket in a swing chair smothering kittens (I am expecting you Mr. Bond,Would you like drowning lessons in my shark tank Mr. Bond?) or a Giant with bad teeth and an IQ of a teenage mutant ninja turtle, walking out of smoldering ruins. One more thing, when I am betting Ten Mil. on a game of Poker,I don't want a bearded guy flirting with my girl, talk hush hush within ten feet of me-I would have him thrown off the table and do away with him, sooner than this happens in the movie.The music is not the thrillingly haunting, 007 Bond music-except over the titles. This alone puts a damper on the proceedings. The location photography is good. This Bond gets tortured more than any Bond. Is this torture legal? for a Bond Movie? Then again why are we seeing Bond in a wheel chair? even if he is seen in posh locale? Now what kind of impression does this give to future Bonds?",Null,5,8,20 July 2008
Casino," Scorsese's Vegas connection.
","This is like the 'Good Fellas' came to Las Vegas and not all the crowd followed them. Coppola, Scorsese and Darabont-you expect brilliant dialog, narration and direction. Casino, is another masterpiece with Las Vegas connection by Scorsese. The narration has no depth as in 'Good Fellas'. Sharon Stone looks stunning and probably the beginning of her typecasting in movies. She plays the drug addict to the hilt. The movie is very close to the Vegas that existed in the Sixties and Seventies. Ace Rothstein's attorney portrayed by Oscar Goodman is now the current Mayor of Las Vegas. The movie is incredibly gripping with great acting that has tradionally expected from a Scorese film, but the Casting will never be like the 'Good Fellas'.The movie takes off where the masterpiece 'Bugsy' left-off when it comes to the Las Vegas history. The scene where the brothers are done away with is gorily authentic you see only in Scorsese movies. Scorsese will be nominee for 'Aviator'-it is time he gets an Oscar but it does't mean a thing if he does't since he is unofficially the best Director in North America.",8,0,1,20 December 2004
The Great Escape," Ten, for the Bravest of the Men who Died Escaping
","What makes this movie as one of the greatest epic movies was the true story, Steve Mcqueen,direction by Sturges and the stunt riding by Buddy Aikes (had a school for riding in San Fernando Valley) who was subbing for Mcqueen (Insurance would not allow Mcqueen to do the jump even though he was perfectly capable.) The same motorcycle was later ridden by Henry Winkler as Fonzi. 'Shashank Redemption' was great escape movie but it was not during the war (courage of one man over many men) and it was based on Fiction. The fact this movie has stood the test of times because of the unsurpassed endurance, patriotism, ingenuity and positive spirit in the group of men for whom nothing was impossible. Even though this movie had no women (except in the train and public spaces) it was universally liked by men and women unlike other prison movies and all Nationalities. The only anti-climax is Hilts character played by Steve Mcqeen should have escaped (since 8 POW's did escape) since the saddest part was seeing him back in the 'Cooler' (The Gestapo who shot the fifty men, were later hunted and killed by the British Intelligence and of course Germany lost the war.) I would love to see the 'Great Escape 2' by Judd Taylor.",10,0,3,18 April 2011
Rockstar," Badmash Movie
","This guy, Ranbir Kapoor, can't act. He has one facial expression that alternates between a retarded or smelling a gas leak for most part of the movie. He is not even good looking, in fact bordering on ugly as compared to Abishek Bachchan and Akshay Kumar. I have no idea what the directors see in him to waste a movie with him. The story is contrived and ridiculous. The music of A.R. Rahman is the saving grace for this movie that has been overrated-as usual from RK fans. The debut actress is pathetic. She will do lot of justice to the art of cinema..by staying away from it. This is another movie, that shows, that the Indian film industry will never recuperate from the sorry state that is in right now. The newer actors have no clue about acting, nor have they inherited the acting genes.These actors are the worst looking and worst actors in recent times. The movie is about going thru pain to achieve good music..it would have been good story, only if it was written well and acted well but with the latter day Lila and Majnu's, it is a pathetic and a disjointed jargon. The direction is half baked and primitive.The dialogs are written by a high school drop out (are you dying? or when are you dying!) For heaven sake shape up or ship out. This movie sucks big time and waste of time for any one looking for good cinema. Rating of 3 for the music and supposed to be the last appearance of Shammi Kapoorji on the celluloid. The director should find a day job as gaffer since he knows the inside out of film making.",3,5,12,8 December 2011
Slumdog Millionaire," Scumdog Exploitaires
","Danny Boyle. This guy who looks like a rat should have done the scene that shows a kid covered with excreta getting an autograph from the likeness of Amitab Bachchan must be the most disgusting scene ever filmed in the history of motion picture. Why would an Icon like Amitab Bachchan (if he has any self respect or dignity left after this movie,) give permission for his likeness to be used in this scene? I never seen a human being so libeled or shown in bad-light as in this movie. The script should never have been passed (eg.'the lazy Indian who wrote the history of Taj Mahal') Has anyone with any decency or any shame pass a script with dialog like this? Then there is this maggot screenwriter (and lazy scum) screenwriter, whose dialogs are in the same caliber as the 'excreta scene'. The kids have acted well (rather been exploited well, The only money they probably got, was the money and coca cola given them to them in the movie. The teenagers are the worst set of actors I have seen. If you want to see a good Indian movie that truly depicts the slums, poverty and still brings out the positives in them, Madhur Bhandarkar's 'Traffic Signal'.The director of this movie should wash Bhandarkar's feet and drink it-may be, he will get some talent by osmosis. The main lead is OK actor-he is not Oscar material. The actress (it is apparent that the second biggest cinema industry has dearth of actresses-so she'd to be imported) has no skills. As far A.R. Rahman this is not his best work-listen to the music of 'Swades' and 'Jodha Akbar'. This is what happens when when you let two scums who are given a free ride in a place where there are no child labor laws. This is not a movie, but more like a collection of clips haphazardly put together with no sense of story-telling or continuity. It's obvious that the movie is made for the sake of making quick bucks by exploiting the children and the poor. I am in total disbelief this has been passed by the Indian Censors. Since this producer pig eats human excreta he and his screenwriter should dip themselves in excreta and run to accept the Oscar's (which seems to be inevitable-judging by the hype.) The Oscar Committee and the audience will be pinching their nose from the 'Stench of Film-Making' these two have generated.The word 'Unjust Enrichment' applies to the producers of this Film. If they have any remorse, any conscious, instead of rationalizing and finding an excuse to keep the money, they should give the profits back to the 'children of this world' who have been victims of exploitation (child prostitution,child labor,scams,denied opportunities etc,etc) since it only takes 'A Dollar A Day' to feed a child in India, Africa and the rest of the impoverished World. These children are dying at the same rate as this movie is raking the money at the Box office.",1,55,103,18 January 2009
Goodfellas," Milestone In Movie-making
","Narration by Ray Liota and Lorraine Bracco. The background music that fits every scene like a glove. The incredible acting by the cast. The incisive screenplay and dialog with the best Sicilian accent and humor. The brilliant direction by the Four Best directors in North America (the others being-Coppola, Wise and Wyler) The casting is the key to the marvel of these evergreen classics. Gangster movies or any movie that brings the sinister side of the human psyche, have a certain edge over the goody goody sugar coated flicks, since they donot give the opportunity to bring the best of the talent in the cast. This is one of the movies where every scene is etched in my memory, because of the sheer directorial brilliance in story telling and editing. This is a milestone in movie-making.",Null,0,0,4 June 2003
