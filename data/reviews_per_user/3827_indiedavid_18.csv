The Lobster," OK premise, horrible execution
",I was hopeful that we were done with the trend of screenwriters who had good ideas for films and were unfortunately allowed to execute the process themselves by well-meaning people. A great idea in the hands of an incompetent filmmaker is just a bad film and that is exactly what 'The Lobster' is. The premise is unique enough but the film falls apart essentially from the opening frame. I can suspend disbelief for an absurd plot but the writer failed to establish plausibility among the characters and their decisions. It made absolutely no sense why any of them would follow the paths they were following. I have no idea how this film has a 7.2 rating on IMDb because the theater was sold out and not one person seemed to enjoy it at all. Most of the crowd was just laughing at the amateur ending. I recommend staying far away from this film with so many better options available right now.,3,11,16,11 June 2016
Gravity," Like an amusement park ride - Spoilers...
","I must have seen a different 'Gravity' starring George Clooney and Sandra Bullock than everybody else saw. There are some great SFX but there is absolutely no story and so many holes, it was hard to get through. I compare this film to an amusement park ride. Plenty of thrills and close calls but absolutely no substance and when it's over, it's over. I won't bother with the improbabilities in the film but if you are a thinking person, it will be hard for your to get past them. From a story perspective, we are expected to believe that although every other astronaut in history trains for decades, NASA let a woman who took a crash course in space exploration, travel with a crew to repair some equipment. Not only did they let her go on the mission, somehow, she has the capacity to navigate a space craft back to earth. In just a few months of training, I could barely solo a Cessna 172 and I am quite capable.",5,1,3,23 October 2013
Lone Survivor," Powerful and Intense
","As a combat service veteran, I can relate to the intensity and chaos surrounding the close range fire fights depicted in this film. Rather than emphasize large scale attacks with countless deaths, this film focuses on four Seal team members from a personal and professional perspective. The action scenes are realistic and very well done. I read through some of the negative reviews and they are either by people who are biased against the war or have never seen the film. When the closing credits scrolled, everybody in our theater was in tears or stunned silence. Neither I, nor anybody else in the world except Marcus Luttrell, can attest to the accuracy of the film but it doesn't matter. No film can be 100% accurate for a plethora of reasons. If you are not a radical anti-war zealot and can enjoy a powerful and well made drama, do not miss this film.",9,2,9,24 January 2014
Us," 80s ripoff
","Younger audiences may not remember but this film is just a compilation of several 80s clone and zombie films. They were really a tongue in cheek joke back then but it appears this guy is trying to pass it off as creative. He failed in a huge way. There are way too many continuity errors and plot issues to make it a serious film. It appears from the positive reviews that a lot of kids or unsophisticated viewers enjoyed it but save your time if you are someone who appreciates quality story telling. If I weren't watching free on a flight, I would have bailed after the first 8-10 story issues.",3,1,2,18 August 2019
Juno," Umm I like think this sucked cuz um like the dialogue was um like weak
","This is the most contrived, unrealistic film rip off of the century.Regardless of what she says, the writer stole a story premise from the Korean film jeni/juno, added some Jon Favreau and Wes Anderson dialogue and, in a very poor attempt to be hip, wrote the annoying children characters to speak like Kip and Napolean Dynamite.She is so out of touch that her references cross four decades.How is it that nobody questions how a stripper can write a screenplay with absolutely no film background or writing instruction. Oh I know, she is a prodigy. No, she is a plagiarist.Hollywood has become the land of replication so I guess she fits right in.",3,26,76,15 January 2008
Life of Pi," Great visuals, pieced together story
","The setup and foundation for this story were interesting and unique but there are some fundamental flaws which give the story a fragmented feel. The writer tried way too hard to establish motivation for the main character. When a character's motivation is too obvious, the story loses meaning. I am not sure if the writer intended to push a religious agenda onto the reader or he/she didn't know how to keep the story moving without a spoken 'meaning' behind everything Pi experienced. Sometimes it's enough to just tell a great story. The visuals were impressive enough to keep my attention throughout the film but overall, I would rate it as a mediocre experience which is quite a shame since there was so much potential.",7,2,6,28 November 2012
Interstellar," Don't believe the hype
","'Interstellar' was an above average film and I have no regrets spending a Friday night checking it out. Unsophisticated audiences may enjoy it if they don't analyze it too deeply. However, if you are one who understands the world of physics, aviation, or space travel, this one is hard to watch. There are a plethora of continuity issues as well as plot holes. It seems like Chris Nolan watched 'Gravity' and decided he could make a really terrible film into something worth watching. He added the 'Contact' premise and inserted some Physics theories and some expanded back story to create a mediocre film. I was hopeful that I would be impressed by the obviously inflated reviews but I wasn't. The guy next to me actually fell asleep during the first hour which was very grueling. Of our group, there were three thumbs down and one thumbs up.",6,17,33,7 November 2014
American Sniper," Don't listen to the negative, politically motivated reviews
","If a review includes 'George Bush', 'Haliburton', etc. skip it because those fools didn't even see this film. I don't know much about Chris Kyle's history so I cannot comment on the accuracy of his story but what impressed me with the film was the accuracy of combat operations. Eastwood was very meticulous to capture every detail of team operations, uniforms, communications, equipment, vehicles, etc. I can usually pick apart hundreds of details in military films but he did his homework. I even noticed an Army NCO with a 2nd Ranger Battalion tab working with the team on a few missions. Most Directors would have just shown Seals, presuming the public doesn't know any better but SOCOM operations often include troops from multiple branches. Also, from a technical perspective, Eastwood managed to get some outstanding action footage. There were several extended, low light and varying light tracking shots that were executed flawlessly. During the whole film, I could see the meticulous attention they gave to color and light matching. Taking all of that into consideration and the performances by the cast, including non-professional actors, I think Eastwood delivered big time. For the reviews that say this film is propaganda, you should skip those too, they didn't see the film. 'American Sniper' clearly balances the hooray moments with the inherent tragedy of war and the physical and mental damage it inflicts.",10,39,82,19 January 2015
We're the Millers," Implausible and Contrived But Fun
","If you are expecting a cerebral story or child-friendly film, don't go see this. However, if you are looking for frivolous fun and can suspend disbelief even in the face of obvious continuity errors and a cut and pasted script, check it out. There are moments that are far too implausible and many comedic moments taken directly from other comedies (Malibu's Most Wanted, Identity Thief, etc.) but overall, I am not disappointed that I spent $11 to see this film. The kids play their roles well and Ed Helms and Jason Sudeikis deliver as always. Additionally, if you are male and a fan of Aniston, it will be money well spent.",6,2,7,19 August 2013
Yesterday," Good film with major plot holes
","Overall, this film was enjoyable but the filmmakers made a serious error by establishing that the members of the Beatles were real people. This presents two scenarios: 1. They formed the Beatles and the music would still be in existence. 2. They never formed the Beatles and never wrote the music so it would not exist, even in the memories of the lead character. Introducing John Lennon into the story completely derailed the story. Not sure if it was done as a mandate by Yoko Ono or just to establish nostalgia but it completely unraveled the premise of the film.",7,1,2,27 July 2019
Frozen," Bailed after 27 minutes of trailers
","Our girls loved the first Frozen and were excited to see the sequel. Unfortunately, small children have short attention spans and adults have IQs over 75 which gives us the intellectual capacity to know when we are being played. We anticipated 3- 4 trailers but we were forced to sit and watch 27 minutes of bad trailers and even worse Maria Menounous blabbering about multiple topics. Just as we thought the film was going to start, Maria Menounous appeared again to introduce her short film. We had enough at that point and just left and got a refund. We have the Disney app which we will keep until the girls lose interest but we will never go to a theater to watch another Disney film.",1,1,3,15 December 2019
P.S. I Love You," Bland
","One of my pet peeves is when somebody writes a film review and says 'It's not at all like the book'. Well, guess what?? That's because it's NOT the book!!!!! It's an adaptation that must condense a story premise, introduce and develop characters, create story arcs and climaxes in 90 minutes based on a book that takes many hours or days to read. If you like the book so much, maybe you would be better off NOT seeing the film. Now, for my review of this film. It's quite formulaic and predictable, has a tremendous amount of dialogue that has been stolen from classic novels and films, contains many pretentious and contrived scenes, and the casting of Hillary Swank was a huge mistake. On a rainy evening, this is a decent film to watch with your wife or special friend when it comes on HBO but strictly from a film perspective, it's not very memorable.",5,1,2,27 June 2014
The Mist," Watchable if you can ignore the poor production
","The story was OK but there were so many errors and cliché characters that it was a tough watch for me. First, this is supposed to be a contemporary story, yet the military police vehicle and uniform is from the 1970's. Additionally, MP's are not sent out into the public to track down privates to tell them that their leave has been canceled. I also could not figure out why the privates were wearing Class A dress uniforms to a grocery store. The religious doom sayer character (Marcia Gay Harden) was just laughable. There were also several scenes that were supposed to create a sense of tension but I also found those to be more funny or implausible. The creatures were very poorly animated and came off more like a low budget 70's drive in movie than a $18 million horror. I think the flaw in this film is the script and the director. Both did not do King's book any justice.",5,0,3,9 August 2015
Lincoln," Save your money
","I am baffled by the IMDb rankings of this film. I found it historically interesting but far from entertaining. It dragged on like a poorly acted stage production. Over-acting, poor lighting and continuity errors were too prolific to keep me involved with the story. It was almost like a Mel Brooks parody film with cliché characters and inappropriate dramatic portrayals of lesser interesting roles. The theater was full and as we exited, not one person seemed to enjoy the film. This would make a good film for the academic environment but it is definitely not something I would recommend spending $11 to see. Wait for Netflix to get it. At least you can do something productive during the three hours.",3,15,36,17 November 2012
Moonrise Kingdom," Recycled Wes Anderson Formula
","Although this film was enjoyable, I was constantly distracted because I couldn't help but recognize every lead character in the film. Anderson is a one trick pony who has somehow managed to put the same dis-connected characters in the same dis-functional families and stick them in a new setting and slightly different scenarios, place a different title on the cover and convince studios that it's something new. I was hopeful due to the rave reviews and success of this film in limited release but I feel deceived and cheated. If you aren't already familiar with Anderson's films, you will enjoy watching this story but if you are, you will likely be just as disappointed as I was.",5,4,9,24 June 2012
Godzilla," Mindless Garbage
","I am shocked by all the positive reviews for this disaster. It's nothing more than a compilation of a handful of other film story lines built around a 1950s era creature feature. There are dozens of continuity errors including the size of the monsters. For example, compared to the Golden Gate Bridge, Godzilla is about 40 feet tall. In the next scene, he towers above skyscrapers. Additionally, he is walking in the bay and the water is up to his ankles. Then he dives into the same water and disappears. I can't believe this film got distributed but I guess there are suckers born every minute. Save your money and see this on premium cable.",2,11,22,20 May 2014
Looper," Mediocre at best (Spoilers)
","I hate to be a cynic but I have a hard time believing that the 8.5/10 rating on IMDb is genuine. As for originality, I guess the film could be described as a unique combination of other story lines but definitely nothing innovative. It moved quite slow at times and there are also some serious contradictions and plot holes. In the future, homeless people fill the streets and the US resembles a third world country, yet all of the high rise building are brand new and futuristic. The cars use solar panels to power internal combustion engines which would never be a possibility. In the end, the main character commits suicide, causing his future self to disappear. If he had killed himself at his younger age, the older self wouldn't have existed. There are also some unbelievable coincidences that keep the story moving. I am sure the filmmaker would have some complex explanation but I base my realities on known science and if they have an alternative science, it should have been introduced.",4,57,109,30 September 2012
Her," A new low for cinema
","I cannot believe the positive reviews for this film. How can anybody sit through this ridiculous monotony and not laugh out loud (presuming the didn't fall asleep)? The premise is flawed beyond explanation and the conclusion is contrived out necessity because there is no possible real ending for such a moronic story line. This would be an interesting short film or experimental student project but as a feature, it is a complete flop. There is no way any sophisticated fan of the art of film could give this a rating above 4 stars. How the Producers spent $23 million on this amateur looking mess is beyond me. I presume $20 million went to the cast and Director. The rest was spent on a DP trying hard to create Sofia Coppola style imagery but failing on many levels.",2,3,6,1 December 2014
