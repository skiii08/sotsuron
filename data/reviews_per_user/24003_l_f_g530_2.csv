Black Swan," 10 out of 10 on Portman's dive.
","Wow, that would be the best word to describe this movie. A deep psychological thriller that seizes your attention and gets you on the thin line between reality and hallucinations. Nathalie Portman becomes Nina in this movie and makes you forget you're watching a movie, she get's you right in the head of a ballet dancer with 'no life' and under a ton of pressure. The psychological changes trough the movie are simply perfect, from the acting to the smooth (yet complex) transitions in the scenario. In brief, the main actress delivers a flawless performance, convincing acting and dancing. Kunis' acting is good although not mind blowing and I think that is really unimportant in the movie since there's just no importance accorded to Lily, she's just the pretty party girl that makes Nina envious. The movie itself is wonderfully directed. Great and original filming techniques, excellent montage, great music (thanks to an old master, but it is still well 'mixed' in the movie), awesome scenario. I also loved the surrealistic elements and the visual effects that really aren't placed at the centre of the movie, but support it in a great way (director sometimes get lost into special effects and destroy their own movie). Also, I want to say that this movie seemed to me somehow reminiscent of Polanski's Pianist on a lot of things: - Wonderful acting and the way the main character is followed trough the film - Classical music - Similar atmosphere and filmingWell, that's about what I have to say on this great movie that will remain as a classic in my humble opinion.

Inception," Nolan turns the top in our heads.
","I just saw this movie, and I must say that I am really impressed by the quality of the scenario and the attention to the detail, despite making a big budget and a big box office success movie, Nolan manages to make an 'author'film at the same time.I think this film (it had already started a bit with the Dark Knight) will be regarded as a change in cinema history in a few years, this is a statement by Nolan that you can make a film with deep philosophical implications and still get a success out of it, it's pretty sad that some low budget masterpieces keep going under the radar because they're not filled with explosions and flashy stuff (wich Nolan just masters at a new level with this movie), but that's how it seems to work, at least Nolan forces the public to get quality entertainment instead of going to another Micheal Bay movie. Let's just hope some people will now be more exigent towards Hollywood and they won't let some untalented directors and script-writers get away easily (don't get me wrong there's still a lot of other good movies coming out of Hollywood, but some people are just going to cinema if there's some big boobs or some guy walking by an explosion on the poster).About the movie itself, like I said, the scenario is really solid, complex, interesting, built around unanswered questions, filled with details... This kind of scenario goes by really rarely, it's just sad that this movie was limited in time because some characters were not developed deeply enough and some stuff may appear incoherent if it's not explained, but I can't judge because it could be Nolan's will or it could be that in modern cinema producers don't let you do 6 hours movies because you loose a lot of auditors after 2-3 hours, anyways there's maybe like 50 books in the surface of the earth that truly have no issues... Nolan keeps on messing with our heads and to create new elements to question without even giving answers (yeah I hate him right now), it's just a brilliant scenario with a lot of depth and a really interesting vision of the human mind.The directing of the movie is also really good, although Nolan is not David Lynch (maybe because he doesn't want to be...) and the directing is more based on great storytelling and special effects (wich like I said he master perfectly) than on aesthetics and subtle camera and cinematographic effects, in other words the realisation bets more on a 'wow effect' that it messes up with your head. That is not a reproach because I think that is what makes the movie a big step forward in Hollywood cinema, it's the best of both worlds: Lynch/Cohens meets Bay; I might have liked the movie better if it wasn't aimed to be an industrial success, but I respect the decision to deliver quality entertainment to the 'mass' (ok now I'm starting to sound like a pretentious do*che).Also, I appreciated the acting a lot, Dicaprio (Cobbs) keeps getting better and he was already great(god this guys must take a break if he doesn't want to go crazy after this and Shutter Island), Cotillard (Cobbs wife) pulls of, again, a great performance, Watanabe (the Asiatic) plays his mysterious role in a great way, Gordon-Levitt (Cobbs friend?) is pretty good, but is character is just too mysterious (I just don't get his relation with Cobb), Page (the architect (is that me or that sounds like a reference to Matrix)) is good, but her role being important I think it could have been better (still she's pretty young and I'm in no place to judge), and the rest of the casting was just great even if some of the roles were not 'deep'.In conclusion, this movie is a must-see even if you're just watching for the scenario or the flashy 'eye-candy' stuff, but expect to finish this movie with more questions than answers. (when you see the film you'll get the title, and by the way sorry for the mistakes English isn't my maternal language)",10,1,5,6 November 2010
