Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," 7.5/10
","I can't, for my life, comprehend the hate this movie had got. Its a genuinely good movie. There is a good premise, lore, backstory and connections and really good build up to the climax. Punctured with great sequences ( Pod Race), a rating of 6.5 seems unfair, just because it isn't like the first three movies.
The Star Wars fans of old have been disappointed that it didn't play the way they had imagined it would, all the years to it's release. I for one disagree.
It's no Empire Strikes Back ( that is gold ) but IMO, it's certainly better than The Return of the Jedi.
Also, the hate for Jar Jar Binks is surprising. I was indifferent to his presence. The CGI, the manner of speech, the goofiness, nothing bothered me. I was, in all truth, trying to look for reasons people could have hated him, but couldn't any.
Also, I have this movie a 10, a not a 7.5, just to offset the really low rating it has got, which frankly it doesn't deserve.",10,5,6,9 December 2018
