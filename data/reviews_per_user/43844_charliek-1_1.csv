The Legend of Bagger Vance," HavenÂ´t we seen all this before?
","The answer to the question is YES! This is just a remake of Kevin Costners Tin Cup that came for a couple of years ago. Only this time, the story takes place in the 1930s. Matt Damon is ok, Charlize as goodlooking as always but otherwise, this film proved to be a dissapointment. Rent Tin Cup instead if you want to watch a golf-flick.",3,0,3,26 September 2001
