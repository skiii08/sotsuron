Iron Man 3," a great visual performance
","i had the pleasure of watching the movie in a pre-screening, and it was great, and delivers on the action/ popcorn flick. RDJ does what he does best, but the whole idea of him being darker and facing inner demons, just didn't really come of great in this film. (i don't want to talk about because of the spoiler alert) Ben Kingsley was 'perfect' his performance was amazing, and i haven't read the comics, so as to the twist i was actually surprised This movie tried to be more of Nolan feel then previous, (it tried to tame on being more real) which it failed. It still posses its laugh component, and probably more funnier then the second iron man. the only real issue for me was the bad guys abilities, and the way the fought (once you watch it you will get it) but it was still enjoyable movie. it has its usual cool new gadgets, lots of laugh, visually spectacular, and full of action. i give it 7.5/10",7,30,64,18 April 2013
