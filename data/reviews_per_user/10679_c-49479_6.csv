Requiem for a Dream," A shocking film noir
","Close to full mark. A shocking film noir, for a long time can not calm after watching it.The editing is unique and I must say that Allen burstyn's acting is so good. It's no need to do things like anti-drug propaganda education, directly putting this will do better",9,0,0,12 January 2019
Hotel Rwanda," Pattern is a little small
","True story is adapted, all aspects are ok, the theme also makes the film more realistic significance, but for such a theme some local pattern is really small",7,0,0,12 January 2019
Dangal," Inspiration and women's rights
","A Inspirational movie but still should not be pulled on the women's rights, mention women's rights is a little strange, why make women so humble. It still looks good, and it burns in the end",7,0,0,12 January 2019
Inside Out," A little thought
","A little thought, all emotions are emotions we need, with a different attitude,even sadness may no longer be so negative",5,2,5,12 January 2019
Patton," The rhythm is too verbose
","Patton's character is well portrayed and the war scenes of 1970 are shocking, but there are still many problems. The main film is too long and a if put a black-and-white biopic it can be seen as a documentary",4,1,6,12 January 2019
The Silence of the Lambs," Mr.Hannibal
","Mr. Hannibal, who is accustomed to eating human flesh, are you still interested in pork, beef and mutton?",8,0,2,12 January 2019
