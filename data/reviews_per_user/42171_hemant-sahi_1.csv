Requiem for a Dream," If you want the truth, this movie is a must see
","Dealing with all the emotions that all the characters face is a really big deal. when you think about it, its not an easy life...that is if you want to live it. people will come on your way, they will greet you or pretend to greet you, they will welcome you or pretend to welcome you, but they will not live your life. that is all left to yourself. to watch such a movie without overcoming loads of emotions all at once is literally impossible. the director has done a great job in making the viewer think, not only during the movie but days or maybe months or even years after you have seen it. Its your life, and in the end you will be alone. That truth is brought out in the film. Extremely professional shooting with extremely professional soundtrack. This movie is one of those that stand out in the crowd, not because its taller than the others...but because it glows . the sense, the deep emotions the regrets the short moment of joy, no part of life has been missed in this film.A must see for youngsters, old people, young people, everybody.when People say watching a movie is a waste of time, they are definitely not talking about this one.",10,0,1,26 April 2005
