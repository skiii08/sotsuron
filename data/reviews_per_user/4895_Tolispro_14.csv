Raiders of the Lost Ark," GL, SS, HF and the rest is history.
","One of the most iconic heroes in movie history. You got George Lucas fresh out of episode 5, you got Steven Spielberg with movies such as Jaws to his name and you got Harrison Ford who by the time Raiders had come out he was already a household name. I think that--is a formula to success.",10,2,2,30 March 2019
12 Angry Men," Perfect in every way possible
","This is a film where tension comes from personality conflict, dialogue and body language, not action.
Although it may sound ungallant, these 12 Angry Men, are all right without distaff glamour. Their dramas are powerful and provocative enough to keep a viewer spellbound. Too few films take on the art of arguing as a subject; we could certainly use more of them, but until then, Lumet's window into strained civic duty will continue to serve mightily. But if I have to sum up this movie it would be something like this: This movie is a masterpiece. That term gets thrown around a lot -- it's a very easy thing to say about great films like this -- but this movie is one of the best. This is one of the very few films that I will call perfect.",10,0,0,30 March 2019
Us," Jordan Peele is a genius
","It wouldn't be as truly terrifying as it is without the jaw-dropping performance from his leading lady, Nyong'o, and with this collaboration they have created another whip-smart modern horror classic.
Having said all that I think something needs to be said. If you are going to watch this film expecting to see a Get Out part II you'll be disappointed. Peele, sets a new spin on horror films everywhere and with this, he shows different ways of filmmaking. The movie is truly terrifying but yet joyful, with an ending that has you thinking for days and days.",9,19,36,30 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Again, and again, and again George you've done it.
","Amazing, amazing oh..amazing. This movie is slightly underrated I think but it stills holds true to the beauty of the originals. Mark Hamill is again phenomenal in the third installment of George Lucas' fantasy world and it's really amazing.",10,0,0,30 March 2019
The Godfather: Part II," To some better than the original
","To some this movie is better than the original and I can see why. But to call it a sequel is a travesty. This film is way too good to be considered The Godfather Part II. Al Pacino reprising his role as the powerful now Boss of the Corleone family. In this film you see the a cold-blooded Michael that would do anything in his power to secure the happiness and well-being of himself and his family. From the house shooting to the killing of his own brother. But, with a beautiful fairytale about the up-bringing of his father in the States and his struggles. Robert De Niro giving one of what is considered to be his best performance to date. The beginning of a life in stealing and killing, his friendship with Clemenza and the killing of an Italian Boss in Sicily to revenge his mother's death. This movie is as good if not better than it's original.",10,2,2,30 March 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Well done P.J.
",This movie was well-received by fans on the date of it's release and still holds dear to our hearts today. Paying homage to the books written by none other than JRR Tolkien this movie is simply amazing.,10,0,0,30 March 2019
Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse," Phenomenal
","This movie is the best thing Marvel Studious has produced. I myself am a DC fan but due to the hype surrounding this movie I decided to go and watch it and you know what...I was not disappointed. This movie was filled with different and exciting versions of Spider-Man that gave the movie a different feeling. Of course the beloved Peter Parker was apart of it but after watching the film he would honestly be the least memorable of the bunch. Even though, Miles and Peter B. were really fun to watch my vote for the best character would have to go to Gwen. Phenomenal voice acting by the stars(Shameik Moore, Jake Johnson, Hailee Steinfeld, Mahersala Ali, John Mulaney, Liev Schreiber, Chris Pine and even Nicolas Cage) which simply adds to the movie being fun to watch. After watching the movie, a few times I thought I should just post a review and let fellow folks know whats up before they decide to watch it themselves.",10,0,1,30 March 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Peter Jackson keeps it alive
","This movie stands true to it's original and the books. A fun adventure that sees battle and death wherever they go. If you compare them with TFotR and TRotK, Two Towers might seem the weakest but it's still amazing.",10,0,0,30 March 2019
The Dark Knight," Christopher Nolan is a genius.
","This movie is much more than a comic book film. It's not a perfect comic book movie, it's simply almost a perfect movie. Christopher Nolan is not your average filmmaker. Christopher Nolan is simply a genius.",10,0,0,30 March 2019
Rear Window," Hitchcock at his finest.
","This movie has you on the edge of your seat with every little thing that plays on. It's chilling and thrilling in every scene and towards the end you are uncertain of what will happen to the protagonists. Hitchcock's genius is shown in the film every time the camera turns. It's the illusion of voyeurism that keeps us watching. The ability to see what happens without being seen. You start to care about the characters as soon as the film starts. Marriage is the theme overshadowed by murder. James Stewart's finest performance if you ask me and the captivating Grace Kelly as beautiful as ever. This movie is 65 years old, but if you watched the movie without knowing the date of the release, you wouldn't think of it to be older than 10 years old. It has stand the test of time again and again and it has come out victorious. I guess what I am really saying is...if you haven't watched it yet--what have you been doing?",10,2,2,30 March 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Well done Mr. Tolkien
","Fellowship of the Ring - Amazing
Two Towers - Amazing
Return of the King - Simply phenomenal
The third part in the fantasy world of JRR Tolkien is the best of the bunch. Even though it's onebig movie the third part is clearly the best. TRotK has what I believe the best battle not only in LOTR history but one of the best in film history.",10,0,1,30 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," George Lucas...you...
",I feel like I prefer episode 4 than episode 5 for one reason only. Sir Alec Guinness. I do accept the fact that Episode 5 is better but it was all made possible cause of the original and the story and connection of Obi-Wan and Darth Vader.,10,0,0,30 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," YES YES YES A THOUSAND TIMES YES
","My favorite franchise of them all. Still dear to my heart to this day. It's fun, exciting, breath taking at times but overall joyful",10,0,0,30 March 2019
The Godfather," Perfection
","Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest.",10,6,7,30 March 2019
