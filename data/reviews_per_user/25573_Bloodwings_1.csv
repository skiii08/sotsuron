Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," On Stranger tides
","I've always been a great fan of the Pirates of the Caribbean films, and this one surely didn't disappoint. Though I had to admit the Real 3D did tire my eyes after a little while, it was definitely worth it. It seemed like I was actually on the exciting adventure with Captain Jack Sparrow and company to find the Fountain of Youth.The new characters--Blackbeard, Angelica, Phillip and Syrena--were a very successful addition. They created a whole new fresh feeling to Jack's adventure, and all the actors' and actresses' performances were quite exceptional. Johnny Depp's role as Captain Jack was brilliant, as he portrayed many emotions such as excitement, deceptiveness, comedic, thoughtfulness, persuasiveness and much more. Also, Ian McShane, Penelope Cruz and Geoffrey Rush's acting fit perfectly with Depp's performance. All in all, the actors' and actress' work was simply fascinating and made the film all the more exciting.The plot itself is quite exciting and interesting as well, with a few witty tricks pulled off by none other than Captain Jack Sparrow. He travels through inconvenient encounters and enchanting yet dangerous waters in search of the Fountain of Youth. Several others, including Blackbeard, the King of England and the King of Spain also race each other to the Fountain, each of them driven by different reasons. All of this accompanied by unique, interesting, and some evil characters, On Stranger Tides is surely a Pirates film you don't want to miss.",Null,0,1,23 May 2011
