The Blair Witch Project," There's one thing you can learn...
",Don't forget a reserve map.But let's be serious. Those who made this film successfully create the appearance of authenticity although they cheat the viewer a little bit (remember when Heather reads passages out of a book the sound is continuous and but the footage has been cut)They managed to scare the audience considerably and it was amazing how the actors played the enmity and the closeness the protagonists experienced under the great distress.One of the most interesting films of the nineties (9/10),8,0,0,15 December 1999
Children of Heaven," Another Iranian version of 'Ladri di biciclette', but simply the best
","At the Iranian film academy de Sica's 'Ladri di Biciclette' as well as Ozu's early films like 'Tokyo no Yado' have been studied closely. Not in all cases the results have been convincing.In this film the allusions show the impact of the above-mentionned directors. But in this case the result has been excellent (though not superb). Unlike other Iranian films it is not depressing and sinister but tries to show the effects of poverty in a comical way without forgetting its disastrous effects on the human mind, thus reminding one of Chaplin's 'The Tramp' (I think it is no accident that shoes plays such an important role).The film does show the bitter reality of a large part of the Iranian population without compromise. Thus it unmasks the pretenses of the revolution which was fought in the name of the 'mostazafin', the disinherited.",8,1,2,17 January 2000
