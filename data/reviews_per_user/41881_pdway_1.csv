Requiem for a Dream," Unforgettable
","I don't have much to add to all the other reviews, but I too was left speechless and stunned as the film ended.  The performances are all strong, but its the absolute bleakness of the climax to this story that I will not forget. Truly powerful stuff.",9,0,0,26 October 2000
