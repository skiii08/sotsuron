Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Great movie.
","RE: 'Author: Kristine (kristinedrama14@msn.com) from Chicago, Illinois I was a little surprised that 'Who Framed Roger Rabbit' wasn't on the top 250. Almost everyone loves this film. It was a major breakthrough for movies. The cartoon world meets reality. And the characters are unforgettable. Come on, let's try to get this on the top 250.'This is why I don't fully trust IMDb ratings ..its based on USER ratings rather than known movie critics.. I'm not trying to say the average user doesn't know a good movie when they see it, its just a lot of times people vote on a movie that haven't actually WATCHED it.. If you want a more accurate rating check http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/who_framed_roger_rabbit/ I voted 10.0 which is what it deserves. =)",10,0,2,9 February 2005
