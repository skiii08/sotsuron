Howl's Moving Castle," Better than Spirited Away
","Yes, really - so many people seemed to love Spirited Away yet it didn't engage me whatsoever. However, I found Howls Moving Castle enchanting with some excellent characters and ideas - the animation is beautiful as is the scenery (some of it being classic Miyazaki, ie lush green landscapes, gently drifting clouds and the the sounds of nature). Without hesitation I'd put Howl above Princess Mononoke, although it's not quite as good as the superlative My Neighbour Totoro and Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind.Go see Howl - even if you don't like it as much as Miyazaki's other works then you'll certainly see something thought-provoking and imaginative.",9,2,3,12 June 2005
