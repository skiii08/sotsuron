The Rock," A classic action movie.
","After watching this movie, I think maybe there are no terrorists in the world, there are only victims of political struggle. Nicolas cage's early films were good.",8,0,0,30 April 2020
The King's Speech," WONDERFUL MOVIE
","The film is flawless in every aspect, from the soundtrack to the performance, and shows great majesty. Colin's performance is the best of the year in my mind, not one of them. He exquisitely and brilliantly explained the king who was angry and arrogant but lonely, fragile and helpless in his heart. The struggle against oneself is also a battle that everyone should win in his life.",9,0,0,11 April 2020
Black Swan," insist your originality
",Don't be crazy when you are one step away from success. Always remember where you started.,9,0,1,15 April 2020

Erin Brockovich," Salute Erin

Se7en," I AM SCARED
",The biggest feeling after watching this movie is that I can't eat too much. That fat man is so poor.,9,0,0,11 May 2020
About Time," A warm movie
","Richard is good at light-hearted, funny movies. Time travel is a gimmick, but the focus is on family. When the protagonist finds out that even though he can travel through time, he can't avoid the tragedies of his life, such as the loss of a loved one. We can't do anything about it, which is probably the most touching part for me. The ultimate theme is still to learn to love, to live, and to cherish every day with loved ones.",9,0,0,23 April 2020
The Day After Tomorrow," classic disaster movie
","It's a classic disaster movie. No other disaster movie can match it. Both the scene and the story are good. The two characters, the tramp and the dog, are the finishing touches.",8,3,3,5 May 2020
Deadpool 2," A GOOD FAMILY MOVIE
",This is a great 'family movie' full of love and hope: what is the adultery between Thanos and base? The famous X-Men are missing? Will white supremacy continue into the next century? How to shoot fight scenes when there is insufficient funds? Is Peter hot or not? PS: The beginning and end of this film are very interesting.,8,1,1,22 April 2020
Snatch," It can make me laugh
","Thank you everyone, this is an interesting movie and it make me feel happy",9,1,2,19 April 2020
Lost in Translation," I don't like it
","The director described the loneliness and confusion of the two people in a foreign land with exquisite camera language, but I didn't like this movie. You probably don't like all the movies that involve cheating in a marriage.",5,0,1,9 May 2020
LÃ©on: The Professional," Killer is not a killer
","What about killers? What about the police? Cold or gentle, not by occupation to judge. The policeman wanted people to stab him in cold blood ~! And this killer, let a person love dearly just want to gently and gently hug him.",9,1,2,3 April 2020
Cold Mountain," the courage to live
","Love is a long waiting period, like a flight over mountains. In the dim light, even undressing becomes art. In fact, the emotional foundation of Inman and Ada is not reliable. Even Inman himself said, 'I don't even know her', but only the first few memories are replayed in his mind countless times and strengthened into an indestructible fortress, even becoming the courage to live. I have to say that this is the best embodiment of loftiness in the air of great love! Perhaps, it is because the real life is really too dark, so light is also hope. Because of you, I am afraid to die.",9,0,0,8 April 2020
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A rare art
",I like Ang Lee's movie too much. I like the depiction and interpretation of Chinese kung fu and Chinese culture in his lens. This movie contains a lot of philosophy and is a rare art.,9,0,0,18 April 2020
The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," LOVE runs through life
","Sometimes I feel sorry for Button, I want to ask him is he lonely? Later I thought button was lucky. He had an adoptive mother who loved him like the virgin Mary, he had a group of old friends, he had a free soul, he had the company of the sea, he had Daisy's protection and love until death. I love brad Pitt and cate blanchett. This movie is amazing, like a poem!",9,0,1,27 April 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Forget you=Forget me
","After many years of looking at it again, I no longer agree with the love viewpoint in it. No matter how many sweet memories two people have together, they are not worth the irreconcilable contradictions found when reason separates. Maybe you will fall in love with this person again, but this person is still not the right person. Even if you lie down and look at the stars together, it is just meaningless repetition. I like Kate's flamboyant red hair so much that I think it is her most beautiful period.",8,0,0,29 April 2020
Departures," Classical cello music
","The strong allure of joe hisaishi, I know this movie is a must for me .... And the resonance it finally brings is also unexpected. As I watched, I remembered the sight of seeing off my important relatives, and my tears could not be restrained after all. The cello music in it is my favorite",9,0,0,7 April 2020
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," beauty and handsom
","I really enjoyed the movie. This movie made me like the on-screen couple for the first time. More than ten years ago, when I was young, I did not understand other public opinion, I only know that the hero and heroine in the movie is so great, I hope they will be together forever.",8,0,0,25 April 2020
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," good effect shot
",The special effect shots are so good that you can't see any flaws in the movie. It's an orgy for people who love special effect shots.,8,0,2,4 May 2020
