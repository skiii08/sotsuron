The Equalizer," Similar to Taken but with no strings attached. Expect a sequel if it does well $$ wise
",Rating it 7 outta 10 coz there are 70 movies worse than the 30 out of 100 that came out and I have seen this year. Not a MUST WATCH at all...but entertaining almost always.Its like Taken...but no family part of the story...instead its random strangers the protagonist (Denzel) knows better than the other 20 people in the flick. A better plot when thinking about sequels coz there might even be. I only say its like Taken coz its the Action movie minus the usually accompanied humour. Denzel and Liam aren't Bruce or Arnie or The Rock xD One thing that stands out is the hand to hand combat is almost real time...except the villain kill (stands out quit noticeably). Otherwise slo-mo is used exclusively for explosions and crashes.If you're bored on a drunk weekday...you could watch this move skipping the initial 10 mins and never think of a rerun but just be entertained,7,0,2,15 December 2014
The Lego Movie," If you 'LOVVVE' Lego toys and have played most of them products over the years...you're gonna enjoy seeing them in live action
","With LEGO toys, it was about imagination. Make them move, make them fight, have your own stories, have your own ending...where we had to move them ourselves...speak for them ourselves. For me, that was 25 years ago. Now when I see it, I'm reminisced a little bit of those days...but the whole story is not grabbing enough. Everything is predictable...but then again, the stories I imagined 25 years ago were also predictable now. If you are a true LEGO fan and still buy them for yourself or the kids...you'd totally enjoy it...the animation and characters are true LEGO style. And with the trademarks they can use they've done a fun but 'not-so-great' job.At my age, I'd think they could do a lot more with the licensing they have...but if I saw this 20 years ago...I'd definitely be mind boggled!! I am remembering my childhood days when watching the Flame animation and faces...but its not enough to rate it at par with the all the other wonderful animated movies I have seen this year. For a fact... if you have never ever played with LEGO toys, there are tonnes of better stuff out there...which I personally would say you should watch...with a little bit of Google assistance.",6,3,8,18 December 2014
3 Idiots," A hilarious and very much Bollywood conceptualization of 2 stories
","Its definitely a fun movie, without doubt. Copied ideas? Yes! Melded a whole lot of stories that the Indian audience don't know? Yes! Made it purely entertaining and relate-able to the Indian mass? Yes!!What's wrong then? Should have given credit to the stuff they were 'inspired' from... so that we could check out those classics too afterwards and appreciate the original work too.You should definitely see 3 Idiots, before seeing the 'inspirations' to totally appreciate the work. And after watching the movie... give a couple of weeks (if u liked it) and then watch 'The Paper Chase' (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070509/) and read the book 'Five Point Someone' (by Chetan Bhagat). Both the old school movie and the book are definitely worth reading and makes you appreciate the movie that bring all these together. *spoiler* There was a hilarious scene which I later found out was from a NZ commercial. Watch this only after watching and appreciating the movie :) http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXRZcJI9yx8*spoiler end*Watch 3 Idiots if you have not read Chethan Bhagath prior to it. Read the book after if you haven't already...because that was 1 of his books worth appreciating. Watch 'The Paper Chase' also afterwards. You can even just listen through parts of it instead of actually watching...rather than listening to the menagerie of songs that gets you off track in 3 idiots at times.",7,2,4,28 February 2014
