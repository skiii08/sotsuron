Sucker Punch," Awesomeness!
","Just one word to describe this movie. Awesomeness. Why? Do i need to elaborate more? Or do i need to list them down? Just go watch this movie. It won't disappoint you. You will be surprise with the CG, storyline and plot.Let me make it east for you.1. What else do you expect from Zack Snyder's movie? Awesome CGI? Preety girls? And Carla Gugino? 2. The storyline is simple. No need to do lot of homework, Just sit down and watch it and enjoy yourselves.3. Buy the largest popcorn they have in the cinema and you will not notice when you finish eating the popcorn. You won't even realize when you put the popcorn inside your mouth one by one.Last but not least. I fully recommended if you want to watch this movie for the second time because you will know, it won't disappoint you.",9,5,14,27 March 2011
Transformers," The Best Movie of The Decade!
","The title says it all. Gonna watch it 5 times and in a record 3 times in 4 days. I like the storyline and the flow of the movie plus the funny/joke parts is fresh.Glad to see almost my favourite Autobots and Decepticons appeared in the movie. Hope to see more Autobots and Decepticons in the next movie plus Dinobots and Destructicons.The battle scene are awesome and marvelous. The battle is intriguing and suspend. Full of energy and action. What can you expect from a great director, great executive producer and great special effect expertise? The greatest movie of all time that can be remember as long as you live.Hope Michael Bay will continue to direct this movie for 3,4 Transformers movie.",10,2,10,28 June 2007
Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen," AGREED! One of the worst
","I can watch the first movie, 7 times with no yawn, no boredom and still watch the first movie DVD over and over again, but this time around when i watched it for the 2nd time, i was bored to death, Megan Fox acting is worst than worst actress outside there. Story lines? Well, you can forget story lines in Revenge of The Fallen. There's no story lines if you are trying to dig one, just some blah blah blah, flashbacks flashbacks flashbacks, kaboom kaboom kaboom & the audience claps their hands at the end of the movie.The twins character got more airtime than Bumblebee & others? How on earth they deserved more airtime than Bumblebee, Ratchet & Ironhide? Even new character like Arcee, Sideswipe & Jolt DESERVE more airtime than those stupid twins.There's no communication scene like in G1 cartoon when Autubots talking to human in their car mode. Autobot like to park their vehicle & stay in car modes in the hangar? What was that? What are they thinking? Wasting their times, waiting for Decepticons threat in the hangar? Come on Bay! You can do better than that! The human doing all the works? What a lame scene! Megan Fox. I know she's hot than Jessica Alba but her acting is worst than Jessica Alba. She's not into the movie. No emotion, i don't know what happened to her but she's not into the acting. Her acting is worst than worst. Come on Megan, you can do it in the first movie, how come this time, you cannot?I know it's the Box Office movie because of the first movie. People want to see what's next for the Autobots & Decepticons but what they can get is frustration.",1,14,31,28 June 2009
