Hereditary," The Exorcist is far way better...
","When I saw 'this generation's exorcist' on the poster of this movie I had to watch it. When judged by today's standards 'The Exorcist' is still a good solid horror movie but when it came out back in 1973 it was something else, terrifying to death and put a new standard for horror genre and rightfully earned 'the scariest movie of all time' title. I think many horror movie fans would agree with my comment. Naturally I was expecting a horror movie in 'the Exorcist' magnitude but sadly after watching Hereditary the 'this generation's exorcist' claim is nothing but a balloon and a disgrace to what 'The Exorcist' accomplished almost 50 years ago!
Hereditary holds a solid drama character and I think it is a great drama movie than a horror movie. The acting, places, lights, ambiance, cinematography are great. It can reflect the sorrow of the main character's to the audience caused by the dramatic events. Sadly when the horror elements begin the movie quickly turn into a joke. Nothing is solid and consistent and it simply jumps all around different subjects of scary elements such as ghosts, cults, witchcraft, occult and you can't tell what everything is all about or what's going on. This is not a bad thing in most movies as it keeps the audience but Hereditary tends to loose most of them very quickly and even bore the audience with many inconsistent events.
The end of the movie is even a bigger joke! I wish they kept it as a good drama movie and had not touched the elements of horror ar all. I give just 3 stars because of the first half of the movie and all the good qualities I mentioned above however as a horror movie it doesn't deserve even 1 star!",3,0,3,30 December 2018
Justice League," I'm still trembling after 20 minutes seeing the movie!!!
","It's been just 20 minutes since I left the movie theater and I'm still trembling in happiness. First of all I'm a die hard Superman fan. What an awesome movie it was! I was expecting the return of Superman but I wasn't expecting this. I of course read some theories around how he will return and on who's side he will fight. This outcome pretty much covers it all. I almost left in tears when Suprman engages Steppenwolf and I was shocked how well crafted that moment with classical Superman theme. Overall the story is very good. The movie and the characters have good sense of humor. You feel like you get to know the characters more and discover their new sides. New additions to the team Aquaman, Flash and Cyborg have a very good introduction before their own movies coming up. Characters like Batman, Superman and Wonderwoman prove that they have much to offer in upcoming years. Just like Marvel Universe and Avengers I think we will get to see more team ups even in solo movies in the future. This is first in line and with more movies of other DC characters I think there will be more addition to the Justice League in the future. At the very of end of the movie Bruce Wayne and Diana pretty much have a conversation around the same topic. There of course some weaknesses but I can't wait to see the longer Blye Ray version of this movie. I'm very satisfied overall and I will watch this movie again.",10,37,73,17 November 2017
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Worst Star Wars ever!
","First of all I'm a die hard Star Wars Fan but not a blind fan. I coldn't quite feel the vibe when first I saw Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2005) but I was hoping that the story will progress and the Episode VIII is going to be another classic afterall Star Wars: The Force Awakens was a new chapter and sort of an introduction of the new characters and what the Star Wars Univers has became. I think there were many inconsistencies in the story I was hoping to get answers of many of my questions as the episodes continue. Altough I couldn't shake the idea of Disney owning the franchise and could deliver something good out of it. I was ready to give a cahance to new episodes after all it was STAR WARS!
I had high hopes for Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi and I couldn't help myself but to go to the first show of the openning week. I felt my skin crawling when the classic introduction text and music started to appear on the big screen of course there was no way of knowing this was the only exciting moment of the whole movie that was suppose to be another Star Wars classic!!!
The story was terrible. Director and the cast were equially bad although the acting were not bad but not good either. Disney must learn just adding the millenium Falcon and all other characters of the old Star Wars movie can't make a good Star Wars movie!. With episode VII I thought Adam Driver was a joke and disgrace to all the sith Lords before him (especially Vader). With Episode VIII he even seems more of a disgrace. His character is terrible as well. Probably the worst sith Lord ever. Kylo Ren often times acts very childishly throughout the movie rather than a powerful Sith master or he is too weak of a character for even a sith apprentice. A big scratch on the villain . The other characters of the movie are just ok and even Mark Hamill is not quite enough for to save the day. Without getting into the details there were few interesting moments of the movie. As for that I gave 2 stars instead of 1.
I think Disney should quit messing up with classical story and should focus on side stories and maybe never told stories as Rogue One was much better movie than Episode VII and VIII combined.
I have seen many better B Rated Movies than this one. Disney spent millions on GCI and models but all of them are not enough to save this one. Never quite belive that I was going to say this for a Star Wars movie but this is a serious waste of time and money.",2,0,0,16 December 2017
Arrival," Not an invasion movie
",I have just seen the arrival and overall it is a good movie. If you are expecting to see some serious fights and mind blowing action scenes between aliens and humans well this movie is not for you. The arrival is a very human movie around 12 alien space crafts showing up overnight and the events fallow the incident. It allows the audience to be able to see the human nature and all our primitiveness behind our technology and science. Throughout the movie one can see how hostile and paranoid we can be towards each other as humanity and as nations. We have very little faith in unity and almost every time we prefer fighting over reasoning. The story is good and catchy. Acting is also good. A good sci-fi movie with a story to tell...,8,4,11,11 November 2016
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," It was worth to wait for.
","I don't understand how DC fan don't like this movie. Could it have been better? Absouletley yes however it is not a bad movie at all. Acting is good the story is good and there is a chronology in the movie where this one is the next chapter after MOS, ultimately leads it to JLA and from there and in between individual DC universe super hero movies like Cyborg, The flash, Wonder Woman, Aquaman etc. Think of Batman v. Superman as an introduction of new super human characters and villains. I hope ,unlike Marvel and The Avangers, eventually the DC characters will evolve with the franchise and in the end DC and WB will tie all of them together in a way that Marvel could only hope for. I think this is why there have been some loose ends in the story in both MOS and Batman v. Superman because they have just started. There are some weak moments in the movie and some mistakes but this is after all a new beginning which holds lots of potential. The million dollar question is; did it make me feel like a 10 year old again? Yes it did! Over the years we all have seen many super hero movies come and go and some of them were really bad and a total disappointment like 2006 Superman Returns. Batman v. Superman is definitely a masterpiece compare to those ones. Zack and the crew know what they are doing. I really loved the movie and it was worth to wait for. I can't wait for the JLA part I...",10,2,5,5 April 2016
