Hereditary," Don't waste your time or money...
","I wish zero stars was an option so that I could adequately describe how much this film flops. As an avid horror-movie fan, I could not have been more disappointed. The actors gave shockingly unimpressive performances (over-acting in most cases). The plot was under-developed to say the least. I can only use the term 'cornball' to describe it. I am displeased that I wasted my money on this film and will avoid future films produced by this individual as they also produced 'The Witch' which I also found to be 'cornball' and unimpressive. This movie may be okay for someone who has never seen a horror film before but for those of us who watch them regularly, it is a waste of two hours. The inadequacies of this movie are too numerous and deep seated to fully describe. Just don't bother watching.This film is a 'wannabe horror film.' It simply doesn't cut the mustard.",1,5,11,27 June 2018
