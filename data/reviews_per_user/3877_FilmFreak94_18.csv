Howl's Moving Castle," My Favorite Movie From Hayao Miyazaki
","Howl's Moving Castle is one of the best animated films I've ever seen in my life. The animation is spectacular, the English dubbing is near perfect, and the story is complex and engaging that might move you to tears at certain points. The story is taken from the book of the same name written by the late Diana Wynne Jones. It follows a young woman named Sophie who owns a hat shop and leads a very sheltered life. Until one day she meets a strange wizard named Howl who literally sweeps her off her feet. Later she encounters The Witch of the Waste(an old flame of Howl's) who turns her into an old woman out of spite. Sophie now travels to Howl's Castle to try to break her spell and work as a cleaning lady. There she meets Howl's apprentice Markl, and a fire demon named Calcifer. Calcifer says if she can break a certain pact with him and Howl then he will try to break the spell that's on her.That's the basic plot behind the film but as we enter the middle of the film it becomes much more complex and it all leads up to a thrilling climax and Sophie trying to break the spell that's on her and Howl. This is not only my favorite Hayao Miyazaki movie but it's also my second favorite animated movie. If you haven't seen this movie yet, you owe it to yourself to check it out.",10,0,1,24 June 2011
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Honestly, My Least Favorite Star Wars Film
","The Phantom Menace is usually the one Star Wars film that most fans can agree as the worst. Why exactly? Well I'll get to that.The plot takes place years before the original Star Wars and follows a young Obi Wan Kenobi(Ewan McGregor) and his Jedi master Qui-Gon Jinn(Liam Neeson). They are sent to the planet of Naboo to negotiate peace terms between Naboo and the Trade Federation. The Federation does not want peace and conquers the planet holding the Queen at hostage. The two land on the planet and meet a Gungan native named Jar Jar Binks. He leads them to the capital city where they rescue the Queen and several others and retreat to another planet.They stop on the planet of Tatooine to find another fuel source and meet a young Anakin Skywalker(Jake Lloyd). Qui-Gon senses the force is strong with him and takes him with them to Coruscant to have trained to become a Jedi.But a new threat is rising and the shadow of the Sith is returning to the galaxy. The mysterious Darth Maul is sent to assassinate the Jedi and the Trade Federation is not going to give up Naboo anytime soon. The battle to start it all is about to begin.The plot sounds like a Star Wars movie but there's something about Phantom Menace that seems off to me. For one thing, most of the actors are all pretty good for their own right. But either a bad script or bad direction makes most of the dialog feel unnatural. Sure Star Wars has never been one for normal conversation between characters but the older movies seemed to do it more casually. And here's the big thing that most people thought was wrong about this movie. The comic relief. No I don't mean C3PO or R2D2 they're as good as ever, I mean Jar Jar Binks. His character is the definition of pandering to the kids. He doesn't do much of anything except lead them to his home and then just sticks around for the rest of the movie not doing anything but looking like an idiot. His character could've been handled a lot better.And another big factor is the performance of Jake Lloyd as Anakin Skywalker. He's too normal. He has a happy life, a good relationship with his mother and all around likes everything. So how is there supposed to be darkness in his heart or whatever? He's the chosen one sure but you're not gonna expect us to think the whole Darth Vader thing just came out of nowhere are you? On top of that the way he delivers his lines are just wrong. He seems to just have one personality. Obnoxiousness. It's really off-putting.Another nitpick is Yoda. He's supposed to be younger here but he looks a thousand years older. Whoever designed the puppet for this movie really didn't do their homework. Frank Oz is still great but I'm wondering why he looked so off.But still the movie does deliver on its action scenes. While the first battle with Darth Maul and the space battle feel rushed and not as epic as they could've been, the fight with Maul near the end of the film is spectacular. And the Pod-Race at the middle is pretty intense too. So yeah this movie isn't my favorite of the Saga but I don't think it's horrible. Maybe the hype was too much. Maybe the film just couldn't live up to the expectations. Maybe it wasn't entirely Jake Lloyd's fault that Anakin was so annoying and more bad direction or script. Any way you look at it the film just doesn't really deliver(at least for me).But even though this movie is my least favorite, I can always watch it whenever I have a Star Wars marathon. And more than likely I'll go see it in 3D. It's still Star Wars, and worth at least one watch.",6,3,7,17 February 2012
Coraline," Dazzling, Frightening, And A Truly Amazing Film
","Coraline is a stop motion animated movie based off the novel by the genius author, Neil Gaiman. Directed by Henry Selick(Nightmare Before Christmas, James and the Giant Peach) Coraline expands the story from the original book and makes it into it's own glorious movie.Coraline Jones has just moved into a new house called the Pink Palace. The house is split into three ways; the main house, the attic, and the cellar. Coraline shares the house with her strange neighbors Mr. Bobinsky who is training a group of mice for a circus, and Ms. Spink and Forcible who were once great theater stars. Coraline's parents are making a catalog for a botanical magazine and are much too busy to satisfy Coraline's boredom. She befriends a neighbor boy, Whyborn(Whybie) Lovat whose grandmother owns the Pink Palace.One night Coraline is awoken from her sleep by a mouse and is lured to a mysterious tiny door in the wall of her living room. Using a button shaped key, she opens the door and goes through a tunnel to a parallel world of her own. There she meets The Other Mother who looks the same as her regular mom but with buttons for eyes. The Other Mother makes fantastic food, and shows Coraline many wonderful things. Such as an actual mice circus from the Other Bobinsky, a show by the Other Ms. Forcible and Spink, and a magnificent garden tended by her Other Father. But everything is not as it seems. Coraline soon realizes the only way to stay in that world is to let the Other Mother sew buttons into her eyes. Soon Coraline discovers the true intent of the Other Mother and the once wonderful world becomes distorted and terrifying. Coraline needs to escape from The Other Mother and get back home to her real parents. If they're even still there.Coraline is one of the best animated movies I've ever seen. It's dark and beautiful style amazes me every time. This whole thing was done by hand for many years and you can tell everyone put their heart and soul into it. The voice acting is also great. Dakota Fanning gives Coraline a spunky personality, and Teri Hatcher's voice performance made The Other Mother all the more horrifying. The rest of the cast is great as well with actors like John Hodgman, Ian McShane, Jennifer Saunders, Dawn French, and Keith David bringing life into their respective characters.If you get the chance you should buy the 3D version. Unlike most films the 3D version was made before 3D TV's were available to the public and instead comes with regular red and blue 3D glasses. This makes the visuals feel a little weird at first but the 3D is some of the best I've seen. Overall, you owe it to yourself to watch Coraline. Either buy it from your local store or rent it from somewhere. It's an experience you will not soon forget.",10,0,0,17 October 2011
Beauty and the Beast," A Tale As Old As Time But Never Gets Old
","Much like Lion King, Disney is releasing another of their traditionally animated films to the 3D big screen. Three guesses which one. Anyway, I figured this was as good a time as any to give this a review.Beauty and the Beast is a tale of a beautiful woman who meets a horrible beast and changes his attitude for the better. Simple, but Disney takes this tale to new heights. First of all, Belle(the beauty) is a very pretty young woman but is seen as an outcast in her village because she doesn't put out like the other girls and rather prefers to spend her time reading books. The most popular man in the village, Gaston, wants to marry Belle because he considers himself the most beautiful creature to ever enter the Earth and Belle to be as beautiful as him. But Belle can't stand him and keeps refusing his attempts at courtship.The plot really kicks off when Belle's eccentric father, Maurice, travels to a fair to show off his new invention. He get's lost along the way and is chased by a pack of wolves to a mysterious castle. There he finds that the household objects are all enchanted. There's Cogsworth(a clock), Lumiere(a candlestick), Mrs. Potts(A teapot) you get the gist. The master of the castle however, is a beast with a serious attitude problem. He locks Maurice in his dungeon and a few days later Belle finds the castle while looking for him. Belle opts to take Maurice's place as Beast's prisoner.What follows is the typical romance formula of two people who can't stand each other at first but slowly come to care and love for one another. Only this is one of those times where it's done perfectly. First of all they don't start really building a relationship until Belle chews Beast out on his temper and Beast saves Belle from a pack of wolves when she tries to leave. You start to see Beast's attitude really change for the better. He starts wearing better clothes, his voice becomes softer even his animation seems a little lighter. Near the end of the film Belle leaves to attend her sick father and Gaston finds out about the Beast and Belle's feelings toward him. He leads an assault on his castle which leads to an entertaining climax with the enchanted objects and a pretty intense fight between Beast and Gaston. This movie is great. The animation is great, the characters are well written, everything is great. And I don't think I have to mention the songs. I'm sure we're all familiar with 'Be Our Guest' or 'Beauty and the Beast' and they're great every time I hear them. Much like Lion King the only bad thing about the movie comes from an edit in the special edition. 'Human Again' was designed for the original release but was cut probably for time purposes. It saw the light of day on Broadway and was added to the ten year anniversary edition in 2002. Well it's not a terrible song but it does interrupt the flow of the film.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone of all ages. I'll probably go see it when it hits the big screen and I suggest you do the same.",9,1,2,11 January 2012
Batman Returns," For What's It's Worth, A Worthy Sequel
","Batman Returns takes place a little while after the events of the first film. Batman and Gordon are working together to keep the streets safe for the holiday season when a new menace arrives in the sewers. A business tycoon, Max Shreck(played by Christopher Walken) is captured and taken in the sewers to meet the mysterious man called The Penguin. Penguin uses Shreck's connections to resurface and establish himself in Gotham City. Shreck soon uses the Penguin's new popularity to his advantage and starts a campaign to elect him as mayor.While this is going on lowly secretary for Shreck, Selina Kyle, finds out more than she was supposed to and is killed by Shreck. At least for a moment. Selina survives the fall and creates Catwoman to extract her revenge. She also starts a relationship with Bruce Wayne while frequently going toe to toe with Batman.Batman has his hands full this time trying to stop Penguin's true scheme and contending with Catwoman.This sequel draws the focus more to the villains. This works well at some points, like the origin of The Penguin and not so much other times, Selina's transformation scene. It's not that the scene is terrible it's just it drags a bit long. Batman is still present of course but his role is somewhat smaller this time around. The action scenes could also be better polished as the choreography of the fighting looks sloppy sometimes.But for all its faults what this movie does pull off it pulls off great. I'm most impressed with Michelle Pfeiffer's performance as Catwoman which manages to seem confident and edgy but also a little insecure at times. And I'm impressed with Danny DeVito's Penguin. His character actually comes off as pretty tragic at certain points but he still manages to provide a threat to Batman. There are times when I think he tried too much to mimic Jack Nicholson's Joker but I manage to overlook those moments. Gotham City is still beautifully designed and the supporting cast gives it their all. Michael Keaton still gives off one of the best Batman in the history of cinema and Danny Elfman's score is fitting to the dark tone of the film.Overall, this sequel isn't going to please everyone who liked the first movie but I still recommend watching it. It's a good movie and a worthy continuation of the Batman Saga.",8,2,4,18 December 2011
The Polar Express," Some Parts Work While Others Don't
","The Polar Express has the difficult task of trying to take a book that's no longer than about twenty pages and turning it into a feature length film. For the most part some of the stuff they added, like the extra characters and settings, work but there are still some things that feel unnecessary.The story is on Christmas Eve a young boy hears a noise outside his house and goes outside to see a train named 'The Polar Express' has just rolled up to his house. He's invited by its strange yet friendly conductor to come with them to the North Pole where Santa will choose a kid to give the first gift of Christmas to. On the trip the boy befriends a girl who has trouble leading others and a younger boy who is incredibly shy. He also encounters a strange Hobo who lives atop the train who turns out to be a ghost. The boy, who remains nameless throughout the film, must learn to believe in things that seem impossible while their journey takes place and even gets a special gift because of it.Some of the things that work for Polar Express are the characters which are all pretty fun and the settings which are gorgeous. However the film isn't without its problems. One major complaint some might have is the animation itself. A common criticism is that the characters all have blank emotionless eyes which personally I never thought. I will say the way they animated the Elves is pretty uncanny though. There's also the strange choice of having Tom Hanks perform and voice several characters, like the Conductor, the Hobo and even Santa himself. They look a little different from each other but you can tell it's the same person even with slight voice difference. There's also the sometimes jarring adding of some scenarios to lengthen the film. There's a scene where they have to move caribou from the train tracks that seems to add nothing and a scene which explores Santa's workshop which is creative but after they rejoin the crowd it's never really brought up again and there's nothing really new that we haven't seen from other films that have portrayed the workshop.But the film is enjoyable nevertheless. It's not the best Christmas film but it gives you a warm feeling by the end that every good holiday flick should provide. And that song at the end credits to me is one of the best representations of Christmas in any film.",7,2,3,16 January 2013
Tangled," My 2nd favorite animated Disney film
","My history with Tangled is a rocky one. Like many people I was disappointed with the trailer and thought that Disney was trying to copy off the formula that made Shrek famous. The tile change from Rapunzel to Tangled didn't sit well for me at the time either. Before I even saw the film I thought that it would be a huge disaster.Thankfully, Disney proved me wrong. Tangled is one of the best Disney films I've seen in a very long time. The story is well written and the characters are all very enjoyable(the horse and the chameleon steal the show). The animation for Tangled can only be described in one word... 'beautiful.' Every little detail in this movie, from the backgrounds to the crowds of people, are perfectly animated. The two things that stand out are the floating lanterns scene and Rapunzel's hair. Admitadely, the songs took awhile for me to get used to. It felt as though Alan Menken wasn't really on his A-game when he did Tangled, but that doesn't necessarily mean the songs are awful, you'll just need to listen to them a few times before they really grow on you. Overall Tangled is by far one of the best films to come out of Disney in a long time. If you have kids or if you're just a fan of animation then you should definitely give Tangled a look.",10,5,6,30 April 2011
Spider-Man," Some Parts Don't Hold Up Today But Still A Good Introduction to Spider-Man
","Geeky science-wiz and High School student, Peter Parker, was bitten by a radioactive spider while on a field trip and developed spider like powers which allows him to climb up walls, shoot a web and swing on it and super strength. At first he uses these powers for his own gain but when his Uncle Ben is murdered in cold blood by a thief Peter decides to use his powers for the benefit of New York City. As his Uncle Ben said, 'With great power comes great responsibility.' While this is going on, Norman Osborn the head of OsCorp has taken a super serum and has gained super strength and a twisted alter ego. He dons a glider and body armor to become The Green Goblin and begins terrorizing the city. He has made it his personal goal to get Spider-Man to join him on his personal crusade against order. Spider-Man has to balance being fresh out of High School, his relationships with his friends and Aunt, and stop Goblin from hurting innocent people.The plot is what you'd come to expect for an origin story but some parts of the film when looked at today are considerably dated. Most of the CGI while impressive for its time looks very fake when compared to the effects we're used to today. Even back then they looked a tad off. For instance scenes where the Goblin is flying on his glider or when Spider- Man is climbing a wall or jumping off something are pretty obviously CGI. It doesn't take you out of the feel for the movie per se but it looks a little jarring.What might take you out of the moment is some of the dialog. Comics in their day had some pretty corny dialog but recently movies have been averting the corny dialog. And even though this movie was one of the first superhero films to revive the genre some of the dialog feels very forced. The scenes with Peter and Mary Jane (his love interest) are sometimes good but other times they feel awkward and that's probably what they're going for since Peter is supposed to be awkward but when he's Spider-Man it still feels a bit awkward. The Goblin's dialog is like it was taken out of the Adam West Batman TV Show. That isn't terrible in fact it's actually really enjoyable but if we're trying to take him seriously as a threat his dialog has to have a little more threatening tone to it.But the film still holds up on the emotional side of Spider-Man. The scene where Uncle Ben is killed is still sad and the relationship Peter has with his friends and Aunt May are performed very well. It's just the dialog that makes it feel a little forced. And the fight scenes are still engaging and filled with energy. The cast pull their characters off as if they were made for the parts. Tobey Maquire does a good balancing act as Spidey and Peter Parker keeping Spidey's sarcastic sense of humor and Peter's nerdy behavior. Kirsten Dunst plays a decent Mary Jane, James Franco pulls Harry Osborn's relationship with his father very realistically, and Willem Dafoe is in my opinion the best actor they could've picked for Goblin and Norman. The one that stands out as the best though is J.K. Simmons as J. Jonah Jamerson. There is no doubt about it he is the perfect Jamerson. His quick humor and motor mouth fit the character to a t, and I can't think of anything bad to say about his performance. So while the film has a lot of flaws it's still a fun movie to watch. It's a nice introduction to Spider-Man if you've never heard of the character(surprisingly enough) and a good film on its own.I give Spider-Man a 7.5 leaning to an 8.",8,1,2,9 October 2012
Twilight," Not a pleasant experience
","Twilight is clearly a movie made to cater to the fans. And only to the fans. The overall experience I had with this movie just wasn't all that fun. The actors performances for the main characters were all pretty wooden, the cinematography was often really annoying, and the dialogue was often laughable. The love story between Edward and Bella just isn't believable either. How am I supposed to believe that watching someone while they sleep is considered romantic? That's not romantic, that's creepy. It seems like the extras themselves tried to bring some personality to their characters but were overshadowed by the sheer blandness of the main cast. It's also hard to take the whole vampires sparkle in the sun thing, when other(better) vampire films had them die in the sun. Just look at nearly all the Dracula films. Dracula didn't sparkle in the sunlight, he died. They mess up other mythos for vampires but really it's the sun thing that takes the cake.This film is not for those who are familiar with vampire lore or are fans of actual romance. I really can't in good conscience recommend this film to anyone, but I rate it a 3/10 because there are a few things I liked. The actor who played Jacob was pretty good, and the baseball scene was pretty well done. As well as the scenes where the three opposing vampires are hunting humans. Those scenes were well filmed and are pretty interesting to watch. The rest of the film however was not very good. Seriously, if you wish to see a good vampire flick, go watch Bela Lugosi's Dracula, Nosferatu, or any of the Hammer Horror films depicting the infamous vampire.",3,2,6,28 July 2011
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," A little better than the first... but that's not saying much
","For the first thirty minutes of the movie, I felt that it was just the first movie all over again. Nothing interesting was happening, Bella and Edward's relationship was going nowhere, and everything was poorly paced and poorly acted out. Then after the Cullens celebrate Bella's 18th birthday and Bella accidentally cuts herself causing one of the vampires to attack her Edward decides it is too dangerous to be around her and leaves. Then the movie gets worse. As the next twenty minutes are spent watching Bella wander in the woods, moan in bed, and write letters to Alice(Edward's sister) explaining her sorrow and that she wishes they would all come back(even though Alice will never even get those letters). And we're treated to a scene where the camera circles around Bella sitting by her bedroom window as the captions tell us that months have passed. And what happens during that long scene... absolutely nothing.The film finally starts getting interesting when Bella starts spending time with her childhood friend Jacob Black. Bella and Jacob start a relationship but it's not long before Jacob finds out that he is a werewolf and he joins a gang of other werewolves. He also tries to tell Bella to stop seeing him, but that works just as well as when Edward did it. The werewolves begin to defend Bella from an evil vampire named Victoria, who is after Bella because of the death of her mate James who was killed when he tried to eat Bella in the last movie. All the while, Bella sees images of Edward telling her not to do reckless stuff, but she doesn't listen and gets into one pointless misadventure after the other(like riding a motorcycle, jumping off a cliff etc.) The jumping off the cliff thing actually has some significance as Alice sees a vision of it and thinks Bella has died. Edward thought so as well, which causes him to try exposing himself by standing in the sun. Bella goes to save him in time and is introduced to the Volturi, who find out that none of their powers work on Bella. And then the events that follow are just like the last movie; a fight happens, then twenty minutes of nothing interesting at all. Seriously, the climaxes for these movies are awful, I just find myself asking 'How long until it's over?' every time. And the movie ends on a cliffhanger, where Edward asks Bella to marry him.This film was bad, but not as bad as the first. For one thing, Bella and Jacob were childhood friends which makes the chemistry between them a little more convincing. And the middle of the film when the Cullens are absent and the werewolves are studied further are some of the better parts of the film. But overall, it's just not a film for people who didn't like the last one. If you're a fan of the series, go right ahead and watch this film. If not, give it a miss.",4,5,7,29 July 2011
The Nightmare Before Christmas," Tim Burton Storytelling At Its Finest
","Tim Burton wanted to work on Nightmare for years but couldn't direct it due to filming Batman Returns. So he got someone who shared in his artistic style, Henry Selick and together they made one of the best animated films of all time.Nightmare Before Christmas takes place in three worlds. Halloweentown, Christmastown and our world. The story is about a skeleton brilliantly named Jack Skellington who is tired of always scaring people and wants more out of his life(or lack there-of). While walking in the woods he stumbles across a circle of trees with doors to other worlds. He enters the Christmas one and is immediately swept away by the bright and colorful atmosphere of Christmastown. He returns to Halloweentown and tells all the other citizens about it. They soon decide they should try Christmas for themselves. Only one person/rag doll experiment thinks this is a bad idea, Sally who is smitten for Jack(and him unaware of it).The citizens try their best but all they can make are scary toys to give to the children. At one point Santa Claus himself is taken to the resident bogeyman, Oogie Boogie after Jack borrows his hat to complete his costume. As Santa Claus is about to be forced to play a deadly gambling game, Jack goes out into the real world to deliver the presents. Things go horribly wrong and soon the citizens of the real world call the military to shoot the impostor Santa Claus down. Merry Christmas right? This film is magnificent. It's perfect to watch on Halloween or Christmas or anytime of the year. The characters are each unique in their own way and the songs in the movie are all extremely catchy and wonderfully orchestrated by Danny Elfman. Personally I can't think of any flaw in this film. Even with the relatively short run-time of 76 minutes the pacing is still pretty good and nothing really seems to drag on. This is just one of those movies you could watch forever and never tire of. Only Tim Burton could think of something this insane and awesome.",10,0,2,23 October 2011
The Evil Dead," A Brilliantly Made Gore-Fest
","The Evil Dead follows five college students driving out to a secluded cabin in an even more secluded forest. At first the five young adults have a fun time with one another until they explore the cellar in the cabin and find the Necronomicon Ex- Mortis, The Book of the Dead. They play a tape recording of the previous tenant of the cabin, Professor Knowby, who recites the incantation described in the book to unleash ancient Candarian demons from their slumber. Afterwards strange things begin to happen around them until a dark force begins to possess them one by one. Will any of them survive the night?When I first saw The Evil Dead I liked it but didn't really give it much thought afterwards. However upon reevaluation and thinking of just how much work went into making it I've come to really appreciate it for its natural horror and have recognized it as one of my favorite horror films. The brilliant use of natural effects like fake blood, stop motion, realistic props really blend together masterfully and make this a truly disturbing experience. The cast deserves major recognition for their work. Of course the one everyone remembers is Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams who in this movie isn't the snarky, one-liner spouting walking bag of awesome he becomes in the later movies but is still a great character here as he has to gain courage through the night and take charge against the Deadites that are trying their hardest to kill him. Another stand out cast member is Ellen Sandweiss as Cheryl, Ash's sister, who at first is the common scared girl we see in most horror films. But when she becomes possessed she turns into an entirely different character. She threatens them all in a dark booming voice and spouts a few lines that are almost comedic in a dark way. It's a chilling performance and without it the movie wouldn't be half as effective.The rest of the cast do a great job too. Betsy Baker plays Linda, Ash's girlfriend, who really shines as a Deadite. Her creepy smile combined with the brilliant makeup make her one of the scariest looking characters in any horror film. And then we have Richard DeManicor as Scotty and Theresa Tilly as his girlfriend Shelly, who were both credited with different names as the Screen Actors Guild wouldn't allow them to star in such a film as this. What's interesting is that Scotty is set up to be the hero for the first half of the film but by the halfway point we switch perspectives to Ash who is forced to watch all his friends suffer and die one by one. Where this movie shines is in its effects. This movie was made on a very little budget by people with little to no experience filming professionally and yet they managed to pull it off exceedingly well. From the cuts and bruises the characters endure to the demonically possessed students almost nothing in this film looks fake. Although there are some noticeable instances where an obvious dummy was used and the stop motion might be considered dated by this time but still in a time where CGI was barely used if at all it's amazing to see this kind of practicality in a movie made by a bunch of college kids. The Evil Dead series gets progressively campier as each film goes on but make no mistake, this film is straight up horror. There are a few unintentional humorous moments to be found in the dialog or a few visual gags here and there but if you're expecting the same kind of humor as its sequels you certainly won't find it here. And what's great about the horror in this movie is it's constantly building you up. You know something is going to happen. You know the movie is just biding its time leading up to the next scare and just when you think you know something is going to happen it doesn't, only to happen about a second later when you've let your guard down. There's a real atmosphere to the cabin and surrounding woods and you feel just as trapped and paranoid as Ash does.The film lives on a diet of blood and gore so if you've got a weak constitution for that kind of stuff you may want to think twice before seeing this film. The standout scene that really scared me though comes in the first half hour where Cheryl goes to investigate mysterious voices coming from the woods and starts getting attacked by tree branches that proceed to rip her clothes to shreds, spread her legs apart and for the coup de grace a tree branch launches in between her legs. This happens for a good 2 to 3 minutes and you're forced to watch the entire thing play out. She manages to escape sure but it's still a terrifying scene and probably the only one that really disturbed me afterwards. However as I said there is a lot to appreciate in terms of how this movie was crafted. This is the first theatrically released film of Sam Raimi, who would later go on to direct the Spider-Man Trilogy and the recently released Oz: The Great and Powerful. And after seeing this movie and looking back on those I can see just how much Evil Dead still influences his style. All in all The Evil Dead is a classic horror film that will leave you guessing what's going to happen every minute. It may start out slow but once it gets going with the horror it doesn't stop until the credits roll. It's a great movie for horror enthusiasts, aspiring filmmakers, and anyone else looking for a good old fashioned gore flick. I definitely recommend it.",9,1,2,27 November 2013
Hotel Transylvania," Fast-Paced, Witty and Just Plain Fun
","Hotel Transylvania is basically a love letter to the classic horror movies and clichés that surround them. Dracula is the owner of a huge castle in Transylvania where he invites other monsters to come and spend their time without fear of being judged or hunted by humans. Aptly calling it 'Hotel Transylvania.' The plot kicks off the night before his daughter Maven's 118th birthday. She wants nothing more than to go outside and explore the world but Dracula is reluctant about this because he thinks that humans would kill her without a second thought due to her being a vampire. Things are shaken up though when a human named Johnathan unexpectedly arrives in Hotel Transylvania. Now Dracula has to keep Johnathan's humanity a secret from his fellow monsters and try to stop Maven from developing any feelings for him. Hotel Transylvania is a very fast-paced movie. The humor often flies in your face a mile a minute and each joke will last just long enough for it to resonate in your mind before moving on to the next one. And most of the jokes are actually pretty funny. Granted there's a few obvious puns in there but they're handled pretty well. And the film knows when to slow down in order to let the plot tell itself. Like the scenes with Dracula and Maven. You can tell that Dracula has a deep love for his daughter and only wants to protect her, and that she loves him too but also wants a little independence. Their relationship is actually handled a lot differently than the stereotypical relationship a father and daughter have in animated movies. They hardly ever fight, except for a scene near the middle, and obviously have a mutual respect and love for one another. That was a heartwarming touch that's a real refresher when compared to other animated films like The Little Mermaid.The animation itself has a nice blend of CGI and Cartoon physics. The characters move very flexibly and often make faces straight out of a Tex Avery cartoon which is a style not often seen in CGI. Each of the characters stand out, there's a Frankenstein (complete with wife), a Wolfman, a Mummy even the Invisible Man shows up. There's also one shot gags and side characters that manage to leave an impression even if they only show up on screen for a few seconds, like a hydra, a fish-man, or even Bigfoot. No character seems to overstay their welcome.Granted having the movie in such a fast-pace is gonna damage a few things. While the parts that are meant to make you feel for the characters are handled pretty well they often move too fast to really leave that much of an effect on you. Without giving anything away there's a scene in the end which plays with how humans react to actual monsters that felt a little too rushed and too forced. But overall this film has a lot to keep you invested. Funny jokes, good looking animation and a lot of likable and hilarious characters. The voice acting is pretty good too with an all star cast like Adam Sandler, Andy Sandburg, Selena Gomez and more. I'm glad I saw this movie and it just put me in a good mood by the time the credits rolled. I say give it a chance. Kids are definitely gonna enjoy it's cartoon humor while adults can appreciate the relationship Dracula has with his daughter, friends and even Johnathan. All in all there's something everyone can enjoy in it and that's a real rarity nowadays.",7,1,3,26 February 2013
Big Fish," A Heartfelt Modern Day Fairy-Tale
","Big Fish is the story of a storyteller, Edward Bloom, who loves to exaggerate otherwise simple stories of his life. This causes his son, Will, to feel distant from his father because he thinks his father hasn't told him a single fact in his whole life. Their relationship is strained, but that doesn't stop Edward from relating his life experiences to Will's wife and others who will listen. He tells such stories as meeting a witch, befriending a giant, working at the circus, being part of a war, and meeting the love of his life. All these stories are greatly exaggerated but the fiction is sometimes more interesting then the fact. Next to Edward Scissorhands, Big Fish is probably the most emotional film done by Tim Burton and it's not like most of his other films. The real world is mostly just plain and not really exciting to look at, while Edward's stories take place in exciting and beautiful scenarios. This film is very different from Burton's usual work and is a joy to watch through and through.",8,0,0,10 July 2011
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," So It Begins
","Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is an excellent film. The casting was perfect, it's like they knew these kids would evolve into the part, the soundtrack from John Williams is top notch, and it's just a fun film to watch. There are some who argue that by following the book so closely the film becomes a bit stale, but I couldn't think of a better way to start the series. By being so faithful to the book, we're able to learn more about the characters and the magical world around them. There are certain parts that could've been fixed but they aren't major and they don't take away from the overall enjoyability of the movie. If you haven't started the series yet or if you just feel like going back to where it all began, I highly recommend this film. A near perfect start to the epic film series.",9,0,1,12 July 2011
It's a Wonderful Life," It's A Wonderful Life, It's A Wonderful Movie
","It's A Wonderful Life is a sort of retelling of A Christmas Carol. But instead of showing a man the joy of Christmas, it's showing a man the joy one man's life can bring to others and himself.George Bailey(James Stewart)is going through a rough time during the holiday season. Nearly everyone in town starts to pray for him when they notice and that gets the angels attention. Joseph begins telling another angel Clarence the story of George's life. Throughout his childhood and early adulthood George made sacrifices for the good of his friends and family. He saved his brother from drowning in an icy lake, which cost him all hearing in his left ear, and stopped his boss from delivering a prescription to a child that he mistakenly filled with poison out of grief for the loss of his son.All George wants to do with his life is to go see the world. He tells his dream to a local girl, Mary(Donna Reed) who has had a secret crush on George since they were kids. He's decided to wait until his brother, Harry graduates so he can replace him to work with their father at their Business and Loan company. On the night of his brother's graduation they find out his father had a fatal stroke. A business rival, Mr. Potter(Lionel Barrymore)sees this as the opportunity to stop loans to the poor.

I may not have done the movie justice by summing the plot up but I assure you you won't regret watching it.10/10 A+ Just perfect.",10,2,4,24 December 2011
Die Hard," An Awesome Action Movie That Still Holds Up Today
","Die Hard is the story of a regular police officer named John McClane(Bruce Willis) who travels to Los Angelas on Christmas Eve to try and make up with his wife, Holly. She's attending a party held by a wealthy businessman at his huge tower building. When he arrives McClane is thrown into a not so regular situation when a group of terrorists, led by the mysterious Hans Gruber(Alan Rickman), take over the building and keep all the guests hostage. McClane is able to avoid capture but must now find a way to get the polices' attention, save the hostages, including his wife, and stay alive.The plot sounds simple enough, because it is, but the action in Die Hard is some of the best I've ever seen in a movie. McClane isn't a superhero and he does take a lot of damage throughout the movie and goes through many close calls. That's what makes you drawn to his character and makes you want to see him get out alive. As the movie goes on he's able to take out each of the terrorists and is able to get up and down the building in very creative ways. He befriends a LA police officer halfway through the movie(played by Reginald VelJohnson) and their conversations delve more into their characters and make them more human. We also learn more about Hans and his motives to capturing the building.All these elements combined with edge of your seat action scenes make Die Hard a must watch for any fans of the action movie genre. Bruce Willis is able to play a convincing every day man who just so happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and Alan Rickman is always a great antagonist. I highly recommend it.",10,1,2,22 December 2011
The Lion King," Disney At Its Finest
","They're re-releasing Lion King in 3D for the next two weeks, so I thought it would be a good time to look back on one of Disney's most popular films. All I can say is after watching this movie countless of times as a kid it still holds up today.The story is about a young lion cub named Simba who is next in line to be the king of the jungle. Simba is rather mischievous and gets into trouble a lot with his friend Nala. His uncle Scar is jealous of Simba because he gets to be the king, so he hatches a plan with his Hyena goons to kill Simba and King Mufasa. They succeed in killing Mufasa but Simba escapes and blames himself for Mufasa's death. He goes into exile and meets two jungle bums Timon and Pumbaa. They teach him the Hakuna Matata(no worries) life style and Simba grows up without a care in the world. But the lions in Pride Rock don't have it so good. Scar has let everything go to ruin and is too stubborn to leave to go look for food and water. Nala leaves to find help and finds Simba. She tries to convince him to come home but he still blames himself for Mufasa's death(not knowing it was Scar who killed him to begin with). Simba must now make a decision to either run from his past or challenge Scar to become the next king.I haven't really done the plot justice by paraphrasing it but I'm sure a good many people are already quite familiar with this movie. Everything in it is top notch. The animation, the all-star cast of characters, the epic score by Hans Zimmer and the catchy tunes from Elton John and Tim Rice. Much like the old Disney movies this movie isn't afraid to get dark. There's numerous assassination attempts(one that succeeds), dark themes you wouldn't find in most kid's films nowadays, and a few jokes aimed towards the older audience. What is not to love about this movie? The only bad thing I can think about this film doesn't come from the original edit. It's the song 'Morning Report' that comes from the special edition released a few years back. The song worked well for the Broadway show but in the movie it just slows things down and seems unnecessary next to the other songs. But still it doesn't change my opinion of the actual movie. I am going to see it in 3D? Probably. But even if the 3D turns out bad it'll be nice to see what it might have been like to watch it on the big screen.",10,4,6,15 September 2011
