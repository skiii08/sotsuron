Resident Evil: Afterlife," Alice is back
","OK, I love this movie series and have super duper HQ extended versions that I can watch over and over. File this alongside those. BUT YOU HAVE GOT TO BE F*****G KIDDING ME! This is the movie series that 'will not die' as in we'll never have any resolution to it. Just when you're ready to say, 'Whew! It's ovah!', they 'kinda' intimate at the end that this isn't the end--guess as long as Milla lives there'll be another one (and maybe when she gets too old to do this they'll just drop in a holographic version of her) (no offense to Milla intended--I'll take a forever Milla/Alice in a heartbeat). Because it is based on a comic/video game and comics/video games never die (unless they're so bad that no one reads or plays them) I shouldn't have been surprised. What a naif I's am. If you loved the first three (and are looking forward to 5-?), you'll have a ball with this movie over and over.Alice is one of the great characters male or female in movie history, and Milla has been a rare treat to enjoy as she's fleshed out the role for four (more to come!) continually evolving movies in this series. Kudos to the director and all who brought this to life. It is rare for me to say it, but this is one movie I will buy.",10,9,21,16 September 2010
