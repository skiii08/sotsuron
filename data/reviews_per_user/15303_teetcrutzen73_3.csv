The Avengers," extremely boring
","I'm 14 years old, the perfect age for superhero movies.I loved the batman trilogy, liked the iron man movies and, ahh what, the spider-man movies where okay. I guess... When i heard the avengers was coming to the theaters, i was going nuts. I liked every superhero movie. But the avengers? No. Boring, unnecessary complicated story and almost no action. Why is everybody so thrilled about this movie? Go watch something real fun, with a cool story. I'm pretty disappointed. I hope the avengers 2 will be better.I'm sorry for the bad English",1,6,37,31 August 2012
The Dark Knight," awesome
","First things first: i loved the movie.Batman is awesome, so as it's villains. The joker is just perfect. A psychotic guy that likes messing with people. Just as cool as the joker in the games. O yeah, and something with a guy with a burned face... Whatever.But aside from that, you have the cool story, the awesome action and of course; the batman!As you see, i can't possibly explain what the movie is about. It's just awesome from the cool beginning until the end.I really recommend the movie, just as the dark knight rises.I'm sorry for the bad English.",10,0,4,31 August 2012
The Dark Knight Rises," great movie
","With 100000 trailers on TV and the internet, i just simply had to watch this movie. Not that i didn't plan to see it before. So my exspectations for this movie where high, and i'm not disappointed.I really liked the dark knight rises, partly because of the joker.Although bane isn't the joker, he's awesome. The fights between him and batman are just painful to watch, not because they're so bad, but because it looks so good.Just like the whole movie, actually. Cool story, cool action. Really recommend it, can't wait until the blu-ray trilogy is available. Just watch the movie, okay?Sorry for the bad English.",10,3,8,31 August 2012
