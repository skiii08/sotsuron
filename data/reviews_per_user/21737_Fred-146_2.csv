The Blair Witch Project," A Brilliant, Original, Classic Horror Film
","I just saw Blair Witch Project for the second time the other night and I was very surprised that the film had nearly the same effect on me as it did the first time I saw it. This is one of the most brilliant horror films I have ever seen!For those of you this movie is BAD, I think your reasons are unjustified. I'm going to list the many reasons why people thought this movie was bad.1. It was a home made movie-----The whole premise of this movie was to show the footage of three filmmakers who went into the woods and disappeared. The ads clearly said that this was 'their' footage? What were you all expected. A glossy, high budget, special effects driven film, with lots of scary music and gore? Come on, these were film students!! The film remain true to that premise and did not deviate from it in any way. This was to look like a home video, and that made the film seem all the more real, therefore, much more effective.2. Those kids were so stupid....Oh, as opposed to those brilliant teenagers we see in movies like Friday the 13th, I Know What You Did..., and countless other slasher films? Give me a break!!! Heather, Josh, and Mike were about as naiive as you and I, but they certainly were not stupid!! Many said they should have carried a cell phone with them. How many people in 1994 had cell phones compared to how common it is today for people to have one? Some said they should have been better prepared for camping. Hello! If any of you who said that had an ATTENTION SPAN would have learned that Heather is the type of person who goes camping and is familiar with navigating her way through the woods. Most importantly, these kids would have found their way out of the woods if they were not scared out their minds!! They were researching a legend, that they apparently believed was not true. Nothing these kinds ever did made me want to shout 'STUPID! STUPID!' at them. I however have wanted to do that to many of the characters in several films. Plus, the characters in most slasher films have a choice to what danger they put themselves in. They know a killer is on the loose. In Blair Witch, the kids were lost in the woods before they realized something unexpected was hunting them down.3. The acting was TERRIBLE!...There were many people who saw this film and thought it was real. Oh, but how could that happen if the acting was so bad? They should have known by that it was all fake, right? I think many of you have confused bad acting with 'raw acting'. The acting in this film wasn't meant to be dramatic, otherwise the film wouldn't have worked. The fact that the acting was so raw, made the film all the more realistic.4. Nothing ever happens in the movie, it's so boring....Apparently you who say this do not know how to use your imagination. Plenty happens in this film. Imagine how you would react if you heard strange noises in the form of laughing in the woods, or if someone was attacking your tent, or if you then found and area of the woods with all these occultic symbols, or if you heard your friend screaming in the woods and you were unable to help him, and then find parts of his body wrapped in his clothing...Many of these things gave me the chills becuase I was able to put myself in their shoes.5. They should run for their lives....What in the world do you think they were doing the whole movie?? They were walking, and running, and running, and going in circles and losing their mind. If you knew what it feels like to be lost, you'd understand that panic ensues and thinking your way out of a situation becomes harder and harder. And when they heard Josh's voice in the house I wasn't surprised they went in after him because that is something I would do in such a desperate situation.I guess many of you still need to the graphic violence and gore for a movie to entertain you and simply can't use your imaginations. Go on and continue to be entertained by the brainless horror films like Friday the 13th. I guess the Blair Witch Project is just way out of your league.This was one of the most original films of the decade and was so worthy of the hype. Many films used hype like TBWP. 'Psycho' comes to mind as Hitchcock stated that NO ONE would be admitted after the beginning of the film. This sparked everyone's curioisity thinking that something happens at the beginning. There's nothing wrong with this as long as the film lives up to that hype. Psycho and Blair Witch both did that.Face it, Blair Witch Project will go down in movie history as one of the greatest horror films ever made along with Psycho, Halloween, The Exorcist, Jaws, Silence of the Lambs, Seven, and Scream. All of these films redefined the horror genre and expounded the limits of what horror films could do at that time.",9,0,1,12 October 1999
For Love of the Game," BORING!!
","How many more flops will Kevin Costner be involved in before his career finally ends? 'For Love of the Game' is just another step in that direction, after such recent bad films like The Bodyguard (which shockingly made a lot of $$$), Waterworld, and The Postman. First of all, at 135 minutes, FLOTG, is WAY too long. Part of the beginning scenes are followed by a flashback that reappears later in the film. Kevin Costner gets involved with Kelly Preston in a relationship that cannot be better described than puppy love. It's stupid and ridiculous how these characters shift back and forth from being together and then splitting apart, and/or having their feeling hurt. I mean, when a relationship is this much of a roller-coaster ride, I'm sure its a strong bet that it won't work out in the long run. But the main problem is that neither one is these two is willing to *commit* to each other. Then there's the whole matter of the 'final game' in which Costner is determined to pitch the perfect game. But will he? Becuase he's so ticked off about being traded by his team, etc. I seriously couldn't care less, but since I was stuck in the theatre, I decided to make up some suspense of my own. That moment came went a rookie player came up to bat. There was a brief scene in which Costner and this guy had a brief, but pleasant conversation. I was wondering since Costner was retiring, he would shift all the fame to this young rookie, who would *maybe* be the only player to make a hit in the game. Oh, the suspense of what he might do! One thing though about Costner, is that he seems to be playing roles that cry out to the audience 'Look at me! I'm this hero! Love me! Please, love me!' Whatever. We will only love Costner when he starts to make films again like the nonstop suspenseful No Way Out, where not only he is the MAIN attraction.",3,3,8,27 April 2001
