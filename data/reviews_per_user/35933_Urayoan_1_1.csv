Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Computer graphics fall short in making characters real.
","I was very excited about this movie coming out.  For years, I have talked with many friends about the story before Star Wars (episode 4).  I liked what the movie presented; setting up the rise of the empire and the start of the rebellion. However, what I found weak was in the use of computer graphics in creating certain characters i.e. Jar Jar Bings.  I think the movie lost a lot by not using the costumes used on the previous films. Chewbacca would have looked silly if it was a computer graphic.  The first trilogy, I believe, was made much more real by introducing characters played by people in suits or make up portraying weird aliens.  I think that also helped the script by making it more dependable on a good story.  My hope is that the next few films would take that into consideration and reduce the amount of computer graphics use to create characters.  By using costumes and make up it may bring the 'operatic' feeling the first trilogy had.MN",Null,0,1,10 July 2001
