Requiem for a Dream," Best movie not to watch
","As a film, Requiem for a Dream is unique and a brutal flash of reality. As a watchable movie is it horrifying, depressing and unfortunately -- a brutal flash of reality.  I would not wish this movie upon anyone other than those who wish to view it for its artistic characteristics and its underlining meaning.  If you are bored and want to just watch something, definitely pass this up.",7,0,0,24 January 2003
