The Rock," This movie is really rockin' !!!
","Another comment from Gijssie, the Dutch moviefreak. Like good wine, the older they get, the better they become. And that's exactly how to describe Connery's share in this fanatstic movie. And not only good old Sean gives a fabulous performance. How about the always convincing Nicky Cage? The Rock is absolutely one of the most spectacular, fantastic, nerve-breaking movies ever made. I've seen it for about ten times, and it's still getting better. This movie really rocks!!!",10,1,1,18 June 1999
The Shawshank Redemption," Terribly underestimated
","(Note: my English is not really superb!!!) This movie is absolutely one of the most underestimated movies ever. This great all-round performance has never gotten the recommendation it deserves. I was very happy to discover that I'm not the only one who's deeply touched by this movie. A deserved first place I think. And for everyone who hasn't seen it yet, and can appreciate real quality: you really have to see this one!!!",10,0,0,14 June 1999
