Blade Runner 2049," As perfect as a sequel gets.
","This film delivers on the original in every way, while at the same time expanding on the world of Blade Runner. I'm calling this one to win Oscars for Best Picture, Best Visual Effects, and Best Cinematography. yes, it is that good (while I might be calling it a little too soon.) I'm writing this review because I just want to see how this movie succeeds, it seemed like a big risk for Sony to make such a sequel to Blade Runner, let alone make THIS. The visuals are stunning and they will leave images within you that will stay with you for years to come. The story and presentation is thought-provoking and expertly crafted. So please, support this movie.",10,3,13,6 October 2017
