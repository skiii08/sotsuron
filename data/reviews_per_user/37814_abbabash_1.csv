Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Uma does act!
","Great great movie! I've not seen it in theater and bought the DVD just today... In Italy it's on sale just since Sept. 22nd! In combination with chapter 1 is in my own top ten movies of ever... Better than Pulp Fiction a big lot, and I do love PF! OK, no big fights as vol. 1, much of chit-chat... but surely Uma does act! SPOILER AHEAD In the almost final scene, when Beatrix is crying/laughing in the bathroom: well, I've seen many crying and laughing of joy, but no one crying for sorrow and laughing of joy in the same time! Well, in vol. 1 Uma jumps, kicks, punches, slashes, thrusts and slaughters... In here she just acts... And f***ing really well! 10 of 10",10,1,3,1 October 2004
