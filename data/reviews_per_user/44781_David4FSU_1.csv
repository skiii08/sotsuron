Vertigo," Worth checking out
","I agree with some of the comments on here that the movie may have been a tad long and could have been trimmed a little.  It did have some very cool camera shots, most notably the kiss where they embrace and they rotate the room to take him 'back in time' to the  carriage house.  I bet that shot would be easy to do nowadays, but I wonder how they did it back in 1958.",7,0,3,30 March 2003
