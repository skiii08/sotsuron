Blade Runner 2049," good, but need to watch it a second time
","In 1982 I was 18. Blade Runner was not a great succes. Many people said or wrote, that it was too complex. That is was typical science fiction no one likes to watch. It became a cult movie (which to be honest says nothing about the quality of the story). I have watched it many times since. Blade Runner 2049: I saw it for the first time last week. I looked forward to it, because of Ryan Gossling and Harrison Ford for one and because it is Blade Runner, 'the sequel'. I was not disappointed. In my opnion: the atmosphere you feel is sublime. Gossling, Hoeks, Leto and Ford are great. The story is complex and dark. I think Dennis Villeneuve made a worthy successor to 1982 Blade Runner. I rate this move a seven, now, because there are quite a few things I did not understand. This is why I am saying: I need to watch it again. I personally feel that discrediting this movie as a franchise is not fair. My guess is that Dennis Villeneuve is a big fan of the first Blade Runner and really wanted to make this movie. Not just to 'cash in'. Off course, some like sweet, some like sour. So, not everyone will love it (as not everyone loved the 1982 Blade Runner). Try to judge this movie more or less as a standalone movie, leaving aside your emotions about the first one. It doesn't have to become a cultmovie part 2. I don't think any sequel has ever become a cult movie, when the first one already was (okay, maybe the Star Wars movies in the 80's and Aliens after Alien.) Enjoy it !",8,0,2,8 January 2018
Into the Wild," extraordinary
","An extraordinary person who inspires us to think.
This movie is a true gem. A young man had the vision and the guts to seek for freedom, for truth, for purity, for beauty. A very bright young man who wanted to undo himself from the lies around him. Wanting to be a balanced, independant person, selfless, not chained to a job or money. Happy with nothing. As he says himself: to kill the false being within. This extraordinary young man lived a great adventure, since he left home. Sean Penn has made a fantastic movie / almost a documentury and Emile Hirsh probably played the greatest part in his life (I hope he will play bigger and better, but people remember him now, 10 years later, as the guy from into the Wild). This is a must see movie. It opened my eyes. It shows where the real friendship and beauty lie.
I read a lot of people's reviews, especially the negative ones. Many wrote he was irresponsable, running away from home without a word. Selfish, because he only followed his dreams. I think you people are missing the point. Whose dreams should he follow then? His parents lied to him and his sister for a very long time. He was shocked, maybe devastated and wanted to pursui his own happines. Who can blame him? It was HIS life, don't forget that. This is the exact point, his life, no one owed him. He died, yes, maybe he was naive, stupid or over confident. I think he was just going for it and maybe, just maybe he made his piece dying out there. Accept that, respect that. He chose his adventure because it was his decission. His. Not ours, not from a society that constantly presses other people what to like, what to wear, what to watch and what to condemn.
Again: to kill the false being within. This is all just my opinion. I feel we are all entitled to have our own opinion.
I rated this movie a 10. This is my favorite, so I am biased.",10,0,2,15 February 2018
