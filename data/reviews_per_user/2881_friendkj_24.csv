The Avengers," The superhero film that made everyone fall in love with Marvel
","Comic book films before were regarded as only comic book movies. But it was not until 2012 when The Avengers was released that it made everyone see comic book films in a completely different light. It also made many people fall in love with Marvel and the characters associated with Marvel. This film was one of the most highly anticipated films of 2012. It is the first time on the big scream that we get to see all of our favorite characters together, fighting and saving the world. Some of the characters we have already seen like Iron Man, Hulk (though this time played by Mark Ruffalo and not Edward Norton), Thor, and Captain America all of whom have had their own movies so far. These characters are some of the most likeable characters to be on the big screen. The acting in this film is spectacular and all of the actors/actresses are the characters that they play. When you think of a specific character from this film, the likeness that comes to mind is the likeness of these actors/actresses. Through in some spectacular action scenes and you have one of the most entertaining films that have ever graced the big screen. The Avengers is a film that fails to dissapoint.",10,1,1,5 February 2020
The Incredible Hulk," Better than Hulk (2003)
","With the success of Iron Man in 2008, people were waiting for the next Marvel film. Little did they know, The Incredible Hulk would be released the same year. Although the film stars Edward Norton as Bruce Banner, this is the only film where he stars as Bruce Banner as he would later be replaced by Mark Ruffalo. The last time that people saw the Hulk on the big screen was way back in 2003 and people were not entirely impressed. While this is an MCU film, it has a completely different tone. It has a much darker tone to it. The story itself follows Bruce Banner who is in hiding from the US government while also trying to find a cure for his condition. Yeah, nothing spectacular but it was not badly done. The acting was good, and the action scenes were also good. Even the CGI was pretty good. What this film lacks is the ability to be rememberable. Maybe it is because this film does not have Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner or it has a different tone than any other MCU film. Whatever it is, I will not be remembering this film years and years from now. Not that it is a bad film, it actually is a good film. If you were not a fan of the 2003 Hulk film, then this is your only other option. A good option nonetheless.",8,0,0,22 January 2020
Iron Man 2," Not as good as the first film
","As far as sequels go, most of the time they do not live up to the original. This is one case with Iron Man 2. The first Iron Man film was a perfect film. The acting was fantastic. It blended humor with the action. It was an entertaining film. Iron Man 2 is all of that but just a little less. For this sequel, it does not offer anything really new. The story was a typical hero vs. villain story with some good action scenes. We see War Machine played by Don Cheadle this time around (Terrence Howard was War Machine in the first Iron Man). I did not think that recasting was neccessary but they managed to find someone better who happens to be Don Cheadle. I suppose this sequel did not really live up to the hype that it was given. It is still a good film. But in terms of sequels, it is just a film that did not really offer anything new.",8,0,0,29 January 2020
Spider-Man 2," An example of a perfect superhero film
","There many good superhero films. But very few are perfect. Spider-Man 2 is one such example. While the previous film was a good film, this one betters it. The film still keeps the theme of with great power comes great responsibility. But what is different is that Peter is struggling with this power. Not that he is becoming irresponsible, but rather he does not want to have the responsibility or power. The villain in this film, Doc Ock, is a better villain than the Green Goblin in the previous film. Alfred Molina does a fantastic job playing the villain. With that being said, the fast paced action in the fight scenes are quite extraordinary. The visuals are quite extraordinary as well. I also like how we set up Harry Osborn to be a possible villain due to the fact that he believes that Spider-Man killed his father. Seeing the struggle is also quite extraordinary. In conclusion, this film is perfect. I have seen this film kind of become underrated as the new Spider-Man films have been released. If you are looking for a perfect superhero film, give Spider-Man 2 a look. You will not be dissappointed.",10,0,0,14 January 2020
Blade," A fun vampire flick
","Vampire movies are usually considered to be low quality. For the most part, that is the case these days. I mean look at the Twilight series! But every now and then a good vampire movie comes up and in the 90's there were 3 vampire films that are considered to be the best. Bram Stoker's Dracula, From Dusk Till Dawn, and lastly Blade. The movie Blade was based off of the comic book series starring the character Blade. The late 90's were the start of the comic book movie era where the comic book movie was becoming more and more popular. Of course, there have been movies based off of comics before hand but they were of lesser quality. Blade is a fun action packed film. While overall bad comic book movies were so bad that they were entertaining, Blade is entertaining because the action is good. There are some typcial action cliches but nothing too annoying for the viewer. The overall story is thin but again, nothing too bad. The acting is pretty decent and that is saying something considering with the next 2 Blade films, the acting does get worse. Throw in some gore and you have an overall fun film. If you are trying to find a fun vampire flick, Blade is certainly the film for you.",7,3,3,7 January 2020
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," An Origins story that could have been perfect
","Wolverine, with out a doubt, is a badass. He was also very popular. Popular enough to get his own solo film in 2009. There would be a further 2 more solo Wolverine films in 2013 and 2017. When X-Men Origins: Wolverine was released, it was not recieved well by critcs at all. Up until Dark Phoenix, it was considered to be the worst X-Men film. Is it as bad as the critics say? No, not at all. X-Men Origins: Wolverine manages to be a good film but fails at being the perfect origins story for an amazing character. The film follows Logan aka Wolverine's love is killed by his brother. Logan decides to seek revenge and then becomes a ,mutant. As far as to the origins of Wolverine, there is not a whole lot. What was described in the movie could easily have been used in the earlier films. Personally, the more I think about it, I don't think an origins film was really necessary for a character like Wolverine. Maybe I need some sort of knowledge of the comics to understand the things that occured in this film, but should I honestly have to? A comic-book film should strive to appeal to a bigger crowd than just the typical comic book readers. The action was good and all that stuff. The acting was not too bad. The dialogue was OK. This film just has terrible writing and it just ends up being forgettable. Not at all bad. Just not a fantastic film.",7,0,0,23 January 2020
X-Men," A good debut for the X-Men
","The new millenium was when comic book movies were to be taken much more seriously. Blade (which was released in 1998 and even before hand with Tim Burton's Batman films) were good films but it took another film to get viewers and critcs to take the comic book movie seriously. That movie would be X-Men. While not the first depiction of the X-Men ( a spinoff TV movie called Generation X was released in 1996), it is one of the best known. While I have not read the comics, I have a general idea of what the characters should be like. Overall, the characters are pretty good and the actors and actresses are perfect for the roles of the characters. The villan, Magneto (played by Ian McKellen) is not a cliche villain at all which is a huge surprise. But where does the film lack? That would be in special effects. Granted, this was when CG was starting to become better, the CG was not great but not terrible. The plot is a typical taking over the world kind of story. Nothing special there. Which leads to the big picture. This film did set the ground for future films and this film did a good job in doing so.",7,1,1,8 January 2020
Spider-Man 3," The weakest of the Tobey McGuire Spider-Man films
","Spider-Man 3 is said (and is) to be the worst of the Spider-Man films. Though I heard 1977 theatrical pilot was bad, but you know what I mean. But saying this is the worst Spider-Man film is not saying a whole lot. Because, it still manages to be a good film. Spider-Man 2 is one of my favorite superhero films and it is obvious that no sequel could top it. The film follows Peter Parker (aka Spider-Man) as his suit turns black which brings out the dark side of Spider-Man and essentially Peter. Peter tries to combat the evil at the same time as Sandman and Venom are wanting to destroy Spider-Man. For me, I like the idea of seeing a character that is all about being good, suddenly go dark. It is different and a creative idea. Even if certain scenes (like Peter becoming emo) is a little bit cringy. The fact that there are two villains can be a bit much to take in but nonetheless the fight scenes are pretty fun. With that being said, Spider-Man 3 is an overall harmless film that people just seem to hate. Understandable, but there is more good to be said than bad.",8,2,2,20 January 2020
Blade II," On par with the original
","Guillermo Del Toro is a talented movie director. But Blade was really the first big hit for him. The first film was action packed, filled with blood and gore. The acting was decent but the plot was thin. Well, this sequel manages to have all of that exactly. Which for some it may be a bad thing considering that it does not improve any of the flaws over the original film. It can also be a good thing also because that means it is not worse than the previous film. With that being said, Blade II can be considered an underrated sequel. If you really enjoy the original film but have not had time to see this one, then I would recommend watching this film.",7,0,0,9 January 2020
Captain America: The First Avenger," Finally, a good Captain America film
","Before 2011, there were a total of 2 Captain America films. The 1944 serial film and the 1990 film. Both films were not great and they left fans of Captain America wanting a good Captain America film. Well, it seemed fitting that Captain America be put in the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the 2011 film, Captain America: The First Avenger. I missed the chance to watch this in theaters but do remember watching this film when it came out on DVD. Captain America is a fairly easy film to follow along with it's simple story which follows the origins of Captain America. But that is what it is, only the origins of Captain America. Before Captain America, there was Steve Rogers. It would be nice to know a little bit more about Steve Rogers. With that being said, the rest of the film is perfect. Hugo Weaving plays Red Skull and plays the part very very well. Chris Evans plays the part of Captain America fairly well and usually whose likeness comes to mind when I think of Captain America. Which is something that the MCU does fairly well in doing. The action here is done fairly well with WWII style action scenes along with some sci fi action scenes as well. With all of this being said, Captain America: The First Avenger is the Captain America film that fans have been waiting for and the wait was entirely worth it.",9,0,0,4 February 2020
Spider-Man," One of the best early comic book films
","Spider-Man is personally my favorite superhero. He is just your friendly neighborhood super hero. If I learned anything from this film, is that with great power, comes great responsibility. Yeah, It is considered cliche now, but it was a powerful lesson back then and I can always tie the theme to this movie. While, there are bigger and possibly better superhero films to this day, Spider-Man is one of the best of the pre MCU films. (Though there is a film that I believe is better than this one). I enjoy this film a lot. It is a nice origin story full of action. William DeFoe is over the top as Green Goblin, but it actually works in this film! Tobey McGuire is not too bad as the lead in this film. The acting, is not too bad overall. Yeah, there are some cheesy moments, but the action is so well done that those cheesy moments can easily be forgotten. Throw in the great theme and you have your self a pretty good superhero movie. If you have not seen this film yet, then it is time that you do.",9,0,1,10 January 2020
The Amazing Spider-Man," An entertaining film
","People viewed Spider-Man 3 as a bad sequel to the Spider-Man film franchise. While there was to be a Spider-Man 4, it was cancelled and what we got out of it was The Amazing Spider-Man. This time Peter Parker/Spider-Man is played by Andrew Garfield. For the most part, Andrew Garfield is a pretty good actor and is better than Tobey McGuire at times. The one downside to this film is that it's story resembles that of the 2002 Spider-Man film. We have an origins story with a little bit more background on Peter Parker. I think know more about the person is actually a nice touch. For example, Captain America: The First Avenger is a near perfect film. Only because we did not know a whole lot about Steve Rogers. We see a different type of Peter who is maybe not the nerdy, smart teenager like in the Tobey McGuire films, but rather a cocky, but likeable nonetheless kind of teenager. Which I just so happen to like. The acting overall is pretty good but nothing spectacular. The action scenes are done well, but maybe not on par with the other Marvel films that were around at the time. (Do remember that the Andrew Garfield Spider-Man films are not part of the MCU). With all of this being said, The Amazing Spider-Man is an entertaining film. But what this film fails in doing is offering something new. What do not get anything really new in this film. If you want a good alternative to the Tobey McGuire Spider-Man films, The Amazing Spider-Man and possibly it's sequel might be your film to watch.",8,2,2,5 February 2020
Ghost Rider," A bad movie
","Ghost Rider has split reception amongst fans. Some like it and some hate it. As you may already know, I don't like this film. First of all, Nicholas Cage. Why? Nicholas Cage can be a good actor (The Rock) but also a bad actor (The Wicker Man). For this film, he tends to be not an entirely bad actor. He gives an over the top performance but for this film, I do not think that Nicholas Cage was a good choice. The acting in general is mediocre to bad. The dialogue is boring and dull and just awful. The story of this film follows Johnny Blaze who sold his soul to the devil and is forced to bring souls to hell. Simple enough, but the execution is awful because of the bad acting and dialogue. Granted, Ghost Rider himself is super badass. The best parts of the film is where Ghost Rider is kicking butt. But, the CG is bad. But don't worry, the CG in my opinion is better in the second film. With all that being said, Ghost Rider is a bad film based on a badass character. You will find yourself skipping through most of the film to see only the action scenes.",4,1,3,20 January 2020
X-Men: The Last Stand," Not as good as X2
","X2, without a doubt was a good film. But what is notable is that it was better then the first X-Men film. When it came around to X-Men: The Last Stand, it was questioned whether or not it could be better than the previous film. Well, I believe the general consensus states that X-Men: The Last Stand is not as good as X2 and for a few reasons. Don't get me wrong, this film is a good film. Even for a third film, it is fairly good. The action scenes are good but not nearly as good as X2. The effects are not nearly as good as X2 as well. The writing in this film is better with a story that is about whether or not the mutants should keep their powers or get rid of them. To be completely honest, this film has good everything. But, that everything (for the most part) is not as good as the previous film. But, nonetheless don't let that discourage you into seeing this film. As far as X-Men films, it is good. But not as good as X2.",8,1,1,17 January 2020
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," Not great.
","The previous Fantastic Four film was not great but was still an overall decent film. But when it came to a sequel, people were not entirely amazed. The previous film was the same way. This film follows the Fantastic Four fighting against the Silver Surfer who apparently is preparing the planet Earth to be destroyed by Galactus but also Dr. Doom returns. The story seems cool and for the most part was cool. But it is mostly the fact that the acting is still mediocre. We get some silly one-liners from Dr. Doom and other things as well. The characters are the same old characters but we have a new addition and that is the SIlver Surfer. The effects, surprisingly are done much better than in the previous film which helps a lot in the case of the Silver Surfer. Now, I did mention Galactus who is the destroyer of planets. This would have been a nice opportunity to have Galactus in the film, but he is not really 'in' the film. Meaning we don't really see him at all. Maybe a film in the future with Galactus as the villain? Who knows. For the most part, this film is not great and there should be no expectation.",6,0,0,20 January 2020
Thor," A good film for the most part
","Thor, god of thunder, got his first film in 2011 with the film Thor. Thor did appear in the 1988 TV film, The Incredible Hulk Returns. What we end up getting is an overall good film. Chris Hemsworth did a great job as the god of thunder and I cannot really say there was a bad performance in this film. The film has a nice story following Thor being exiled from Asgard only to have to protect Earth. It is nice to see a character like Thor try to adapt to the lifestyle on Earth. The action scenes are done fairly well but nothing that was ground breaking. The connection between Thor and Jane does give a feeling that it absolutely has to happen. For the most part, Thor 2011 manages to be a good film with a good story and surprisingly good action.",8,0,0,31 January 2020
Scream 2," The best Scream film
","They say that sequels rarely are better than the original, but this is one case where a sequel is better than the original. I had my doubts about Scream 2. With that being said, I was surprised. But what makes this film better than the original? First of all, we have better characters. Even though we have the same characters from the original, but to see them living life after a tragic event is quite interesting. Plus, we grow emotionally attached to the old characters. Which is to say that the new characters are good but we do not become emotionally attached to them. With that being said, main characters do die and that just comes to show that this film is not scared to do big things. One thing that made the first Scream work was the self awareness. Another thing is the mystery surrounding the identity of Ghostface. The original film made me surprised but this film made me even more surprised. Typically with sequels, they are absurd, but this film has no absurdity at all. This sequel manages to be more bloody than the original while still being suspenseful and an enjoyable film. A must watch.",9,0,0,4 December 2019
Scream," The film that brought the horror genre back to life
","In the 90s, horror had a big decline. It can be blamed on the fact that most of the films were becoming low quality, poorly acted, absurd, or just the same plot as other films. But when Scream was released in 1996, the horror genre was brought back to life. The film follows a simple plot (that of a typical teen slasher) of a group of teenagers being stalked by an unknown killer. But this film breathes new life into the teen slasher genre. What we have is a film that makes the characters aware. Meaning, they have seen horror films and are at least educated at what to do and what not to do in such a situation. The acting in this film is actually good. Jaime Kennedy and Matthew Lillard are some of the best actors in this film. The characters might be sterotypical, but again, this film breathes new life into the teen slasher genre. But, the characters are likeable in their own way. The rest of the film is suspensful and full of mystery. It is worth watching till the end. So, if you have not watched this film, then it is time that maybe you should watch this film. You will not be dissapointed.",8,0,0,3 December 2019
Halloween," The best in the series
","Ah, Halloween. One of the best horror films of all time. It's a simple story about an escaped murderer going around and killing on Halloween. The atmosphere this film gives out is so realistic that it still manages to be scary to this day. The film decides that minimal to no gore is best and it works! The fact that we know very little about the killer (at least until the sequels) makes this film scary. The acting in this film is top notch. The film is slow at times (which is why this film has not been awarded a perfect score). Some scenes where it is slow, it adds tension but in some instances, it just feels not needed. But, what we get is a classic that is a must watch on Halloween every year.",9,0,2,7 October 2019
X-Men: First Class," A nice reboot
","X-Men: First Class is what people said is the much needed reboot for the X-Men franchise. While not really a reboot, that is what this film appears to be doing. We have the same characters as the previous films but this time around they are played by much younger actors. Do not get me wrong, these actors/actresses play their parts (for the most part) pretty well. There are a few minor exceptions (Jennifer Lawrence, whose acting is a bit hit and miss). For the most part the recasting choices are pretty good with James McAvoy playing Professor X and Michael Fassbender as Magneto. Do notice that Wolverine is not a major character in this film (all he gets is a cameo). If he was going to have a cameo why bother with putting him in the film at all? Either he is a major character in the film or not in the film at all. No between. The directing in this film is pretty good as well. I have not watched any other Matthew Vaughn films to be able to compare, but it gives me hope for a lot of his other films should I decide to watch them. The action is done pretty well with some great scenes that are some of the best in the entire X-Men film franchise. The plot is fairly simple. Two mutants (Charles and Magneto team up and find other mutants who eventually have to save the world. it really is not anything too fancy. With that being said, X-Men: First Class is the X-Men film that mostly all comic book fans have been waiting for.",8,1,1,3 February 2020
Iron Man," The first MCU film delivers
","Iron Man is the first film in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) which is a series of Marvel films that connect in some way. Iron Man is a superhero that has not appeared in any film in the past and it was about time that he did. Without this film, I probably would not known have known anything about Iron Man (I myself do not read comic books.) The film contains a nice origin story of billionaire Tony Stark being captured by terrorists to create a weapon for them but instead he makes the Iron Man suit. What is unique is that we have not a normal person being the hero, we have a rich wealthy person. Of course it has been done with Batman, but that is beside the point. Robert Downey Jr. is perfect in the role of Tony Stark. Actually, the whole cast is pretty amazing! With the MCU films, the effects are better and it really shows. The action is amazing in this film and not for a single second did I get a feeling that it was fake. Throw in some humor (which is funny) and you have a perfect film in one of the best franchises to ever exist.",10,0,1,22 January 2020
X2: X-Men United," Better than the first
","Rarely is a sequel supposed to be better than the original film. This is one such case with X2. The film follows the evil Stryker attacking the mutants which causes Magneto to form an unlikely alliance with the mutants. The film it self improves over the original in so many ways. The acting is better. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are amazing as Magneto and Professor X respectively. The story is better and even brings up certain issues like xenophobia. It is nice to see Magneto willing to work with the mutants. The effects are really good and don't seem to be fake even though they are. The characters are even better with Wolverine being a stand out. With that being said, X2 manages to be an entertaining sequel and not just a stupidly entertaining film, but an actual entertaining film. It is better than the first.",9,0,0,13 January 2020
A Nightmare on Elm Street," A flawless masterpiece
","A Nightmare On Elm Street is just fantastic. It is a great debut for one of the scariest horror movie characters of all time. We see a unique concept about dying in your dreams. A concept that if you think about it, it is quite terrifying. We see some fantastic acting from Heather Langenkamp, Jon Saxon, and of course Robert Englund as Freddy Krueger. I like how we have Freddy start out as mysterious and as the film progresses, a little more is revealed but enough to keep the character mysterious. The effects are great and they still hold up today. What we get here is a scary film with fantastic acting and execution.",10,0,0,8 November 2019
Fantastic Four," Better than the unreleased Corman film
","Fantastic Four movies are not perfect. The last attempt to bring the Fantastic Four to the big screen resulted in the film being unreleased. So, another attempt was made in 2005 (and later in 2015) and people did not really like the film. While a flawed film indeed, this film managed to do what the earlier Corman film could not. This film tells a better origins story where four people go into space and get super powers. This film does not have the campy feel that the Corman film had. While the action scenes were good, there was not enough action. Most of the time the Fantastic Four are doing anything else but saving the day. Dr. Doom is OK. He is not over the top like in the Corman film, but has a darker, more evil side to him. The special effects are mostly CG and most of them end up being too fake but not on the level of say Sharkboy and Lavagirl. The effects were good for their time but have aged terribly. The acting is decent. But as far as Fantastic Four films go, this is the best that it will get (have not seen the 2015 film yet, but I heard it is really bad).",6,0,0,15 January 2020
