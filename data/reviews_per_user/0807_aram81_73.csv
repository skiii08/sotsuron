The Rock," Even on its own terms, the Rock is uninspiring
","The Rock's plot is the epitome of absurd action filmmaking. And while the film has its share of high-octane action and three talented leads, it's ultimately undone by pacing problems, excessive runtime, unnecessary plotting, hackneyed dialogue and just plain stupidity. The film takes itself too seriously to be enjoyed as an over-the-top action picture and it's too silly to be taken seriously as a mature picture with any depth. So the Rock is stuck in the middle and that is not a good place to be for a film like this. The ingredients were there to make a solid action flick. A big Budget, talented cast, and a workable premise. It just needed a better script and direction.",5,1,1,4 June 2020
Vertigo," Hitchcock has many classics but none better than Vertigo
","Some have called this mesmerizing picture, about love, loss, control and obsession, Hitchcock's most personal film. I can not comment on that. But what I can say, is that Vertigo is his most complete film. It's not only suspenseful and entertaining but it's also complex and haunting. The film starts off as an interesting detective story. Then it becomes a suspenseful mystery and eventually a psychological character study. The last third of the film is pure cinema magic. Some of the most tense and riveting scenes in motion picture history. It's not the most realistic film. But because its vision is so imaginative, its themes so thought-provoking and its mood so heady, having an airtight realistic plot hardly matters. With its evocative score, impeccable cinematography, fine performances and its layered and engrossing plot, Hitchcock's masterpiece is like a haunting dream. The perfect movie to get lost in.",10,1,2,25 September 2019
Alien 3," A big disappointment
","What a shame. The third installment of the enormously popular franchise actually has the best premise of the three. But the final product is a lackluster and somewhat dull picture, that is highly frustrating because of the wasted potential. Alien 3 does have a dark atmosphere and another strong performance by Sigourney Weaver but it is not nearly enough to save the film. The script is flawed and offers nothing new or inspiring. The penal colony population is underdeveloped and uninteresting and the direction by David Fincher is less than stellar. That Final scene with Ripley should have been a powerful moment but thanks to the quality of the film, its effects are greatly reduced.",4,1,3,12 June 2019
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A flawed picture for sure but not as bad as some claim it to be
","After finally getting around to watching Phantom Menace, I have to say that the bad reputation the film has received over the years is a little too harsh. Yes, the characters are not well written, the dialogue is a little hokey, the acting and directing is subpar and the whole affair is a bit too long but honestly, most of these complaints could be made about the original three films as well. Where this film shines, is in the technical department. Phantom Menace, is without doubt the best looking Star Wars film from the first four. It outclasses the original three by a mile. Even by today's standards, it looks great. Obviously, this is not one of the best films in the franchise but outside of one 10 minute or so stretch in the middle part, I was neither bored or annoyed. (Well, maybe a little annoyed at Jar Jar)",6,1,1,16 December 2019
The Young Victoria," Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend light up the screen as Queen Victoria and Prince Albert
","The Young Victoria is a charming and breezy look at the early years of Queen Victoria's life, as she goes from being a young Princess dealing with a domineering family and palace intrigue, to her eventual accession to the throne and courtship of the love of her life Prince Albert. Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend are sensational as Victoria and Albert. Every time they are together, they light up the screen. From the first time they meet, you can feel the chemistry between the two. Theirs is one of the great and tragic love stories and even though the film does not cover Albert's death (which plunged the Queen into a long depression) it does play a little loose with history to show us the deep love these two had for each other. The film looks gorgeous. The sets, costumes and cinematography are stupendous. A highly enjoyable motion picture.",8,1,1,2 April 2020
Marie Antoinette," Beautiful but forgettable
","Sofia Coppola's film is visually gorgeous. But beneath the lavish costumes and beautiful set designs, there is not much depth. There is very little happening in terms of plot and character. Kristen Dunst's Marie Antoinette goes through the whole film oblivious to the goings-on around her. And while I know it was done intentionally, it still does not negate the fact that it makes for a less then captivating drama. In terms of the music choice, having an 80's soundtrack for an 18th century period piece was not a wise decision. While not a particularly bad picture, besides being an eye candy, there is not much else to Marie Antoinette.",5,4,5,13 June 2019
Hereditary," Mr. Aster is a young talent to keep an eye on.
","With only two films under his belt, Ari Aster is already one of my favorite young writer/directors. Comparing this film with his second feature, I would have to say that I enjoyed the latter a bit more. For me Midsommar is more of a complete film. Both pictures are creepy, unsettling and odd but Midsommar also has thematic richness and visual beauty that Hereditary can not match. With that said, I still enjoyed the film for what is was; a first-rate suspenseful horror picture that for the majority of its runtime had me in a state of apprehension and bewilderment. As for the performances, the whole cast deserves recognition for their fine work. But Toni Collette's firecracker of a performance takes the cake. She was sensational. With the exception of the ending, which was somewhat of a disappointment, Hereditary is a superb horror film.",9,2,4,29 May 2020
Casablanca," One of American cinema's most endearing motion pictures
","There is not enough praise one can heap on this timeless classic. It is arguably the greatest love story ever filmed. Here is one of those rare films that is like a fine wine. It only gets better with age. A masterpiece of American cinema and a film that can be seen multiple times, without loosing any of its charm. Sentimental to its core but lovely and touching. This story of love, loss and self-sacrifice is the gold standard of romantic dramas. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are simply phenomenal. Every time they are together they light up the screen. Casablanca's reputation is rightly earned. From start to finish, a captivating and sublime film.",10,9,9,2 September 2019
Citizen Kane," Best of all time? Depends on how you are measuring it
","From a technical and storytelling standpoint, Citizen Kane is arguably the most groundbreaking and influential film of all time. Its nonlinear storytelling, innovative deep focus cinematography and overlapping dialogue were ahead of its time. Thematically, the film takes a back seat to no one. Its themes of power, corruption, narcissism and yellow journalism are as poignantly relevant today as they were when the film was made. With that being said, Orson Welles' masterpiece is not a perfect picture. The wooden acting has not aged well and as much as I tried to love this picture, I never could. For me it always feels a little bit cold and detached. And even though with each new viewing I gain more of an appreciation for the filmmaking process, the picture never fully comes alive and I am left with the feeling of watching something that is undoubtedly historically important, innovative, influential and thematically rich but does not give me the full cinematic experience that a great picture of its caliber should. A film to be admired for all of its accomplishments but not one that is easily loved.",9,1,1,19 October 2019
Kickboxer," You know exactly what you are getting with Kickboxer
","Kickboxer is your typical hand-to-hand combat revenge story; Jean-Claude Van Damme's Rocky IV. The opening act gives us the tragedy, and the menacing and indestructible villain (Tong Po) that our hero must conquer. The middle section is dominated by one training scene after another and finally the film concludes with the big fight to settle the score. It should not come as a surprise to anymore that the acting is really bad across the board. Van Damme, who at the time was still very much wet behind the years and would improve marginally during his career, does not emote any real emotion or any semblance of believability in his performance. Throw in some 80's music, cheesy dialogue, a couple of funny moments and some nice shots of Thailand and you got yourself Kickboxer, a take it or leave it proposition. If you do not mind all of the cheesiness, highly predictable plot and bad acting, then you will most likely enjoy the film. For everyone else, stay away, because this is most likely going to bore or annoy you.",6,1,1,5 June 2020
Alien: Resurrection," There was no need to resurrect this franchise
","Alien Resurrection is a film that does not know what it wants to be. It mixes black comedy with horror and miserably fails at both. Sigourney Weaver is back as Ellen Ripley (Actually a clone of the original Ripley) and does the best she can with what she is given, which is not much. She is the highlight of the film, that has almost nothing else going for itself. Besides Ripley, the rest of the characters are either miscast, (Winona Ryder) or just plain silly. Most of the dialogue and acting is risible. The film has a couple of funny moments but is not funny, it has a couple of nice shot scenes but it is not interesting or scary. The Alien franchise should have ended with the mediocre Alien 3, no need for a resurrection.",3,2,4,15 June 2019
The English Patient," Kristin Scott Thomas is a revelation; the film is beautiful and at times powerful but it's also overlong, overambitious and lacks heart
","The first time I watched this film it left a bitter taste in my mouth. But it made enough of an impression on me that I went back for a second viewing. Now having seen it for a second time, I have to say that I gained more of an appreciation for Anthony Minghella's work. While I still believe that the film is overlong, overambitious and is mostly an exercise of the mind rather than the heart, I would nevertheless recommend it for several reasons. First of all, even though the aforementioned shortcomings make for a film that is a bit tedious in parts and somewhat cold, the story is still a good one and there are powerful moments in this film that will stay with you. Furthermore, the production value and cinematography are spectacular. In short, this is one beautiful motion picture. Last but not least, is the performance of Kristin Scott Thomas. She plays Katharine Clifton with intelligence, strength and gravitas and in the process, steals the show. She is by far the highlight of the film. The English Patient is a dense and layered novel and even though Minghella did not fully succeed in translating the pages to the screen, he still made a respectable, albeit flawed motion picture.",7,1,1,10 June 2020
Us," The sophomore jinx gets Peele
","Wow, talk about a sophomore jinx. Jordan Peele's second film is a big drop in terms of quality from his debut feature Get Out. Us, is one strange movie and not in a good way. I don't know what Peele was going for here. For a horror film, it did not have enough tension or suspense to be affective. As for the dark comedic racial and socioeconomic underpinnings that he was so successful with his prior outing, much of that fell flat here. Very little worked with this picture. Even the surprise ending was a yawner because much of what came before it was so uninspiring, that by the time of the big reveal, you had long ago checked out. Hopefully his third film will see him back in form. As for Us, you can safely skip it.",3,3,5,27 February 2020
The Irishman," Scorsese treads familiar territory in what might be his swan song. And if it is, the maestro could not have gone out in a better fashion
","Martin Scorsese's epic gangster drama reunites the legendary director with De Niro, Pesci and Keitel, to produce one of the best films of his career. The Irishman, like its aging gangsters, is a product of a bygone era. A lot of people like to say that 'they do not make movies like they use to' Well, Scorsese has, with this powerful tale of loyalty, betrayal and regret. De Niro has not been this good since the mid 90s. Pesci, who came out of retirement for this role, gives as good of a performance as he has ever given. And Al Pacino, is simply electrifying as Jimmy Hoffa. The film is three and a half hours long but there was not a single moment where I was not engaged with this monumental work of art. 2019 has been a great year in cinema. There have been a lot of great movies that came out during the year and The Irishman is one of the best.",10,3,6,29 February 2020
The Fifth Element," The only positive thing that can be said in its favor, is that it looks good
","I was not surprised to find out that this childish, loud, incoherent mess was written by a teenager. Luc Besson, the director of the film begun writing the script at the age of 16 and you need to have the maturity and sophistication of an average 16 year old to actually enjoy this nonsense. Obviously the plot is absurd but even if one accepts that fact and tries to judge the film on its own terms, it is still a failure. Being odd, witty, funny and self-aware is not the same thing as just being odd and rambling eye candy. I think Besson was going for the former but ended up making the latter. The negativity does not stop with the plotting; there is not a single character that is even remotely interesting and some are just plain old irritating. (I'm looking at you Chris Tucker) The one thing that could be said in its favor is the production of the whole enterprise. It does have a unique and eye-catching look and even though the film is more than two decades old, it still hold up fairly well. But unfortunately for The Fifth Element, looks alone do not make a good movie.",3,1,10,16 April 2020
Batman Returns," It is a flawed film but it outclasses the original
","Does it throw previously established Batman lore out the window? Yes is does. Is it a bit overripe and somewhat silly? Sure, I guess so. And is it a picture that prioritizes style over plot and character development? Most definitely. But Tim Burton's film has such a unique look and feel, that the lack of a strong plot and character development does not hinder the overall quality significantly. Batman Returns, possess a brooding atmosphere, terrific costume, makeup and set design. It also has a couple of excellent and memorable performances by Danny DeVito, as the Penguin and Michelle Pfeiffer, as Catwoman. Unlike the original film, Tim Burton's sequel is not a mano a mano face-off between Batman and an antagonist. It is a melancholy story about three deeply troubled characters. But the main character, Michael Keaton's Batman, takes a back seat to the Penguin and Catwoman, who are the real stars of the film. I only wish that Burton had dug deeper into these two characters motives. This would have helped the plot and character aspects of the movie that were sorely lacking. Christopher Walken's corrupt businessman, Max Shreck, rounds out the main cast and is the weakest of the bunch. A rare sequel that is much better than the original. A flawed but dark, weird and visually impressive film.",6,2,8,18 December 2019
Creed," You can not create the same magic twice
","There is nothing wrong with Creed in terms of direction and acting. The issue I have, is that it's basically the original Rocky and the same magic can not happen twice. It has the same formula of the original film, with Stallone taking on the role of Micky, while Jordan takes on the role of Rocky. With that said, the film is executed fairly well, with a lot of energy. Much of the credit has to go to Ryan Coogler, Sylvester Stallone and the young star of the film, Michael B. Jordan. But at the end of the day, Creed is too predictable and familiar and outside of Jordan's fine performance and arguably Stallone's best work of his career there not much here to recommend.",5,1,1,7 December 2019
The Mummy," A film like this is suppose to have a sense of wonder and excitement, unfortunately, the Mummy is in short supply of both
","Silly, overlong and for an adventure picture, it's sorely lacking in wonder and excitement. The film takes a long time to get the ball rolling and when we finally get to see the Mummy, like the film itself, he turns out to be a dud. Arnold Vosloo's Imhotep is neither scary or interesting and his interactions with the protagonists drags on for too long without any coherence or suspense. The one bright spot in terms of character is the talented Rachel Weisz. But there is very little she can do working with a very thin script. Weisz's talents and the films enormous budget are wasted on a largely empty exercise, that has plenty to offer in terms of production but is in short supply when it comes to story and character.",3,1,5,1 May 2020
Ed Wood," One of the best movies of Tim Burton's career
","Tim Burton, who in terms of world building and visuals is a unique and imaginative filmmaker, has the reputation of being a subpar storyteller. But with Ed Wood, he has finally made a film that not only looks good but also has a good story. At first, I was not all that enamored by the picture. But as I kept watching, it started to grow on me and when it was all said and done, I was thoroughly pleased. In terms of casting, Johnny Depp was a perfect choice to play the 'worst director in history' Ed Wood. His cheerful and optimistic attitude was the highlight of the picture. A terrific performance. The black and white cinematography was absolutely the right choice and gave the film an authentic atmosphere. Johnny Depp and Tim Burton have made a charming and funny picture about the moviemaking process.",9,1,2,14 August 2019
X-Men," Two decades later, it's still one of the better superhero films
","The first major superhero film of the 21st century; X-Men is somewhat of a groundbreaking film. For better or worse it helped usher in the era of the summer superhero blockbuster that we are currently living in. As for the film itself, it's a good one. Some of the casting is flawless. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is right up there with Robert Downey's Iron Man and Patrick Stewart's Professor X is not far behind. Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin are solid choices to play Magneto, Jean Grey and Rogue respectively. Not all of the characterization is spot on. James Marsden's turn as the leader of the X-Men, Cyclops is uninspiring and Halle Berry's accent as Storm is distracting. The story is not earth-shattering but it is engaging. It's an ironic tale of a man (Magneto) that has witnessed atrocity and discrimination and because of his hatred and fear of humans is prepared to do his own acts of atrocity. Come to X-Men to see where it all started for the legendary original cast and stay for one of the better superhero films ever made. Fun characters, some cool action, a bit of humor and a solid story, what's not to like.",8,1,1,23 April 2020
Thor: Ragnarok," A better than average superhero picture
","Thor: Ragnarok is Loud, full of endless and somewhat numbing action scenes and silly plotting. But beneath all the mayhem, there is some small character moments that work. Thor and Hulk/Banner have some funny back-and-forth banter and Cate Blanchett, for the short time she is on screen, is terrific as the evil sister of Thor, Hela. The picture is lighthearted and does not take itself too seriously; which is a plus but all the character moments get drowned out by excessive and CGI heavy action. For his part, Taika Waititi keeps this 130 minute film (maybe 20 minutes too long ) moving at a brisk pace and there is not too many dull moments. Conversely, there is not too many inspiring moments either. What we have here is a slightly better than 50-50 proposition.",6,1,4,22 April 2020
Once," A little gem of a movie
","Once, an indie musical, made with a reported budget of only 150 thousand dollars, is an odd little film. It is a musical where people just do not spontaneously break out dancing and singing for no real reason. All of the musical scenes make scense here. It is a love story without any real romance. Even though the tension is there between the two protagonists, the only 'sexual' scenes we get are a kiss on the cheek and an awkward moment in guy's apartment. The film centers around two young and talented musicians who love music but lack the confidence to pursue their dreams. It is their chance meeting that brings out the best in them. In a perfect world Guy and Girl, played brilliantly by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova, would be soulmates and live happily ever after. But John Carnet is not interested in Hollywood love stories. Life is not that simple and neither is this film. Some people might not like the bittersweet ending. Speaking for myself, I think the ending made perfect sense. I do have to point out that even though I loved the film, it is not without some drawbacks. Not all of the musical scenes hit the mark. But the scene where Girl comes out of the store in her pajamas, with walkman in hand and singing through the night, was simply magical. This little gem of a movie proves that you do not need big budgets and big name stars to make a good movie. And Once, is a really good one.",9,1,1,2 February 2020
"I, Tonya"," Margot Robbie gives the performance of her career in this captivating biopic of Tonya Harding
","If I, Tonya was a fiction most people would say that this could never happen in real life. The over the top family disfunction, the sheer incompetence and buffoonery of the Nancy Kerrigan incident can only happen in the movies. But the funny thing is that all of this cartoonish characters and events were actually based on real life. After watching the film I kind of felt pity for Tonya Haring. From Harding's abusive mother, played brilliantly by Allison Janney, to her abusive and somewhat dimwitted husband and his equally dimwitted friend, the people that populated her life were all lowlifes. Speaking of Harding, the heartbreaking, comical, and electrifying performance by Margot Robbie was jaw-dropping. Hands down the best performance of her young career. From the exciting skating scenes, to the funny, quirky, and sad story, and the can not take your eyes off of her performance by Robbie; I, Tonya is a winner and gets a perfect score from this judge.",10,1,1,28 May 2020
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," A biting satire of the highest order
","Stanley Kubrick's Cold War satire is one of the most poignant and witty black comedies of all time. The Cold War has now long been over with and the threat of nuclear war has diminished but the relevance of the film has not. The reason being, is that Dr. Strangelove is a film about the follies of man. So in a sense it is as relevant today as it was back in 1964. The performances are universally outstanding. Peter Sellers, playing three distinctively different roles is nothing short of amazing. No less impressive is George Scott, whose performance in the hands of a less capable actor might of come across as hokey but Scott pulls off one of the great comic performances in film history. The witty script and marvelous performances are enhanced by an impeccable black and white cinematography and Kubrick's sensitive direction. Dr. Strangelove is a can't miss masterpiece.",10,6,8,11 June 2019
Taxi Driver," A disturbing portrait of loneliness and obsession
","Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver is a riveting character study. A psychological masterpiece about a loner Marine veteran and disturbed cab driver, who wants to clean up the 'filthy' streets of New York City. Robert De Niro gives a tour de force performance; one of the finest and most memorable in cinematic history, as the troubled Travis Bickle. Scorsese, for his part does a masterful job of putting us inside the head of Bickle. We slowly witness his paranoia and obsessions consume him, which leads to the shocking, bloody and ironic ending. The film is also the first major role for Jodie Foster, who was only a teenager at the time and is outstanding as the underage prostitute that Bickle tries to save. Taxi Driver's disturbing story is enhanced by dark cinematography of a sleazy and dirty NY and a moody score to give us one of the best works of Scorsese's career and one of the best films of the 70's.",10,1,2,30 August 2019
Full Metal Jacket," Not quite in the same league as Kubrick's best. But a good picture nonetheless
","Kubrick's Vietnam war movie is actually two movies. One is excellent, while the other is just good. The basic training part of the film is pure gold. It's outrageously funny, endlessly quotable and features a career best performance by R. Lee Ermey, as the Drill Sergeant from hell. The Vietnam part, while not bad by any stretch of the imagination, is a bit of a letdown when compared to the high-octane first act. It does not offer anything new or provocative that has not been covered elsewhere. With that being said, Full Metal Jacket is still funny, unrelenting and ferocious. A picture more in the mold of Apocalypse Now than a realistic war movie. Just not as good as Coppola's masterpiece.",8,0,0,10 October 2019
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," On the positive side, we get less of Jar Jar. Conversely, we get the cringeworthy Padme and Skywalker scenes
","Like the previous film, Phantom Menace, Attack of the Clones is flawed. It suffers from poor character development, subpar acting, weak plot, and some poorly written dialogue. On the positive side of things, Episode two looks great. The special effects, set and costume design are outstanding. The difference between episode one and two, is that the latter is more of an action movie than the former. The last third of the film is what saves it from being a poor movie. One bright spot is that we get less of the annoying Jar Jar but unfortunately, we end up with the equally annoying Padme and Skywalker storyline. The romantic scenes between Hayden Christensen and Natalie Portman were poorly written and acted. There was no chemistry between the two and some of their scenes were cringeworthy. Unlike the first film, where Obi-Wan Kenobi got the short end of the stick, here, he was one of the few bright spots in terms of character development. His scenes were far more interesting and entertaining than that of Padme and Skywalker. Overall, another flawed but somewhat enjoyable picture.",6,2,2,18 December 2019
Apocalypse Now," One of a handful of truly great war movies
","Let's get one thing out of the way before we move on. Apocalypse Now is not an accurate war movie, in a sense that it does not portray the real nuts and bolts of how a war is run. But it's arguably the most groundbreaking. No other war movie has portrayed the dualities of human nature, the absurdities of war and the psychological toll it exerts on the soldiers who fight it, more boldly than Francis Ford Coppola's masterpiece. And none are as visually and thematically haunting. The performances by Martin Sheen, Marlon Brando and Robert Duvall are outstanding. The cinematography is breathtaking and the action scenes are some of the best staged and most memorable in cinema history. An audacious, evocative and gripping motion picture. Coppola is better known for the Godfather but in my opinion, this is his most important work.",10,4,4,9 October 2019
Silver Linings Playbook," Flawed but entertaining, with two great performances
","Silver Linings Playbook tries to mix humor and sadness and almost pulls it off. It is funny and it does have some powerful emotional moments but it is neither a great comedy, or a great drama about mental illness. And the typical Hollywood ending did not help matters. What is great about the movie is the performances. Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence have great chemistry together and play two mentally unstable young adults with infectious zeal. But it is Lawrence who steals the show. She is reason enough to see this movie. Arguably, this may be the best performance of her career. Robert De Niro, in a supporting role is great as well. Even though Silver Linings Playbook has some narrative problems and a typical Hollywood feel-good ending, it can be overlooked, because the characters are so rich and the performances so good.",8,1,1,12 June 2019
Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation," The gang is back but this time they brought along a new friend, Rebecca Ferguson, who is a knockout; in more than one sense of the word
","Rogue Nation has all of the attributes that made the last film a success. incredible stunt work, high-octane action and humor. But the reason this film surpasses the previous effort is Rebecca Ferguson; by far the best female character in the franchises history. She is tough, sexy, smart and a joy to watch. As far as the rest of the cast is concerned, they were all terrific, especially Tom Cruise, who is like a bottle of fine wine, that gets better with age. The story, which is always the weakest aspect of this type of films, was actually the most involving of the franchise; although it was a bit muddled. It looks like this franchise has a lot of life left in it. And seeing how the last two films have outdone the previous efforts, Fallout should really be something special.",8,1,1,10 June 2020
Die Hard 2," Bruce Willis is up to his old tricks again as John McClane, in an inferior sequel to the classic 80's action thriller
","Die Hard 2 has the tagline 'Die Harder' but the film is not as good as the original. To start off with, the bad guys are not as interesting as in the first film. Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber was one of the all time great villains and neither William Sadler or John Amos can match his on screen charisma. The plot is absurd just like the first film but unlike the original, which was tautly paced and exciting, this one was a bit too long and had its fair share of dull moments. One of the annoying aspects of the first film, the incompetent head policeman was also present here. I think that the writers think that creating characters like this will add some humor to the film but in reality it does nothing of the sort. Overall, Die Hard 2 is a mediocre effort that does not match the excitement of the original.",5,1,2,16 June 2020
The Pianist," A harrowing tale of survival
","Roman Polanski's Holocaust film about the Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, is always going to draw comparisons to Schindler's List. And even though I believe that Spielberg's masterpiece is slightly better, these two pictures are actually quite different. They both depict the atrocities of the Holocaust but do it through the radically different experience of the each films protagonist. Getting back to the film at hand. The Pianist is raw, gripping, brutal and inspiring. Polanski holds nothing back, in showing the barbarity of the Nazi occupation and one man's astonishing tale of survival. Szpilman stayed alive through sheer luck, the kindness of others and determination. Adrien Brody's understated performance is matched by Polanski's expert direction and Ronald Harwood's poignant script. An important piece of work. Not to be missed.",10,0,0,10 July 2019
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," The best Mission: Impossible up to this point
","Ghost Protocol, the fourth installment of the Mission: Impossible franchise delivers the goods. It gives the audiences what they expect. The film is full of death-defying and jaw dropping stunts, plenty of action and a touch of humor. The plot is absurd but that is not the point of Mission: Impossible. Its main purpose is to entertain and thrill and for the majority of its runtime it does just that. The cast delivers as well. At this point Tom Cruise was already established as one of the top action stars on the planet and its no surprise that he hit it out of the park one more time. Jeremy Renner and Paula Patton handled their roles admirably and Simon Pegg brought some much needed humor in his role as the brains of the operation. Ghost Protocol does not reinvent the wheel in the action/thriller genre but it gets the job done.",7,1,1,10 June 2020
It Follows," Credit has to be given for originality but it has too many issues to succeed
","David Robert Mitchell's picture deserves credit for originality and some genuine tension inducing moments. But on the whole, It Follows fails for several reasons. First of all, once we get to know the entity, it actually is not all that scary. Secondly, in the case of this film, ambiguity does not help and instead of creating a captivating mystery, it ends up giving us too many questions to be answered; not a good thing for a picture like this. And finally, the film has its share of annoying plot holes and silly moments, which cancel out the positive aspects of the film. The underwhelming ending encapsulates all that is wrong with the picture, in all too bright a light. It follows has an interesting premise but it needed a better script.",5,2,2,8 June 2020
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," It's Tarantino's most personal film but not one of his best
","Quentin Tarantino's 9th film is a peculiar one. In some ways it is not a traditional 'Tarantino' film. It is surprisingly light on violence. Coincidentally, it might be the most 'Tarantino' film he has ever made. The director is in full self-indulgent mode here. I do not think he has ever made a more personal film. Once Upon a Time, mixes fiction and fact, in this buddy tale of a has-been actor, his stunt double friend and an end of an era in Hollywood. For a two hour and forty minute film, there is not much that happens in terms of plot. It is mostly nostalgic and moody. For the majority of its runtime, the film coasts along on neutral. We get a lot of cruising in cars, barefoot hippie girls, cool tracks, beautiful sceneries and outstanding performances. Brad Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio have great chemistry and both men give immensely watchable performances. They are a big part of the reason why this thinly plotted, nearly three hour film was so enjoyable. Even though she does not get a whole lot of screen time, Margot Robbie is enchanting as Sharon Tate. Only if the picture as a whole was as good as its talented cast, beautiful cinematography and immaculate production, then we would have had something special on our hands. As is, Once Upon a Time is a good movie but not one of the directors best.",7,2,3,17 March 2020
Schindler's List," Spielberg's masterpiece
","Steven Spielberg Schindler's List is an emotionally powerful, visually striking and important motion picture. The dramatized real life exploits of German businessman Oskar Schindler is handled exceptionally well by Spielberg. Instead of explaining the motives of Schindler change of heart, through unnecessary and potentially overtly sentimental scenes, he gives us a man that is an enigma. Liam Neeson, for his part gives a nuanced and career defining performance. Ben Kingsley is terrific as Itzhak Stern and Ralph Fiennes is terrifying as the sadistic SS Commandant Amon Goeth. Here is a film that is both horrific and hopeful. A film that shows us what human beings are capable of at their worst and best. From a technical and storytelling standpoint, Schindler's List is first-rate filmmaking. A gripping and haunting work of art.",10,0,1,19 April 2020
Ex Machina," A tense Science fiction film about ideas rather than action
","Ex Machina, Alex Garland's Science fiction film about artificial intelligence, covers no new ground but it is a tense, suspenseful and well-acted picture. Garland forgoes action and special effects and tells a slow-burning story about big ideas. Thanks to Garland and his cinematographer Rob Hardy, the films atmosphere is very claustrophobic and paranoid. Oscar Isaac and Domhnall Gleeson are excellent but the film belongs to young Swedish actress, Alicia Vikander. On the surface, she plays the AI Ava with a childlike innocence and wonderment. But underneath, is a very intelligent and cunning being. Her performance was the highlight of the film. There are a couple of plausibility issues I have with the plot. But they are minor and do not hinder the overall experience of an otherwise intriguing science fiction picture.",9,4,5,27 November 2019
1917," A technical marval and the best looking WW1 film ever made.
","1917, the WW1 epic about two soldiers trying to relay a message to stop a massacre, is a technical marval. The editing, that made the film look like one long shot might seem like a gimmick but it adds to the suspence. There are moments in this film that are simply breathtaking and jaw-dropping. The production, is first-rate. I have not seen another film that made the trench warfare of WW1 come so alive. The attention to detail is stupendous. Where I have an issue with Sam Mendes' work, is in the storytelling and characterization department. The plot is straightforward and predictable and the characters don't have much depth. The whole affair felt like a massive technical exercise. I still very much enjoyed 1917 but I do not think it belongs on the list of the all time great war movies.",8,0,1,19 March 2020
The Piano," Jane Campion's masterpiece
","An original, peculiar and haunting romantic drama. It's a very moody film, with a dark and beautiful atmosphere and a stirring score. Campion's remarkable script and sensitive direction is matched by outstanding performances from the four lead actors. Sam Neill and Harvey Keitel are great and eleven year old Ana Paquin gives as strong a performance as I have seen a child her age give. The mesmerizing performance by Holly Hunter, as the strong-willed and mute Ada, is arguably the best of her career. In my opinion it surpasses the terrific job she did in Broadcast News. Hunter's performance is made even more impressive by the fact she does not speak a single word throughout the film. Then again, who needs words when a simple glance, a touch or music will do the job. The Piano is like listening to a great orchestra. It moves you and then it lingers in you and haunts you.",10,0,1,11 June 2019
Rudy," The ultimate underdog story. Rudy has enough heart for ten films
","Rudy is a predictable underdog story but it transcends its limitation thanks to an inspiring understated performance by Sean Astin and focused direction by David Anspaugh. There is no unnecessary distractions or flamboyance. The focus is kept on this dogged young man who just wont quit and the film is better for it. Rudy does take some liberties with the truth but it does it for dramatic reasons. I have no problem with it, since this is an inspirational film and not a real life documentary. And as far as inspirational films go, Rudy is the gold standard. (And no, I have not forgotten Rocky) In the end you can not help but root for Rudy. Even though you know it is coming, the final emotionally powerful scene, will have you standing and cheering.",9,1,1,11 June 2019
Quiz Show," A smart and engaging morality tale
","A poignant and absorbing look at the Quiz Show scandals of the 1950's with an excellent cast. Robert Redford's film shows the underbelly of the corrupt and ratings driven networks and their singular goal of making profits. Truth, morals and fairness be damned. It is also an indictment on the masses, who partake in this charade. After all, it does take two to tango. The final suggestive images drive home the point. The performances are very good, with the exception of Rob Morrow. his portrayal of Dick Goodwin is lackluster. Considering the subject matter, Quiz Show is not the sexiest of movies but it is an enlightening and sobering one.",9,3,3,14 August 2019
Annie Hall," Marvelous
","The movie that put Allen on the list as one of the best (if not the very best) comic directors of American cinema. A title he would hold for more than a decade and a half. Annie Hall is one of those rare films that as soon as it is over, you want to watch it again. It engages your mind, touches your heart and puts a smile on your face. Scene after scene, Woody Allen's romantic comedy about a neurotic intellectual is full of wit and laughs. It has a smart and funny script and outstanding performances by Diane Keaton and Allen. A film that gave us two of the most memorable characters and some of the wittiest dialogue of the decade. One of the all time great romantic comedies.",10,1,1,29 July 2019
2001: A Space Odyssey," Groundbreaking and awe-inspiring
","Mysterious, languorous, meditative and awe-inspiring. 2001 is not a movie with an exciting plot or well fleshed out characters. (The most interesting character is the AI, Hal) It's a meticulously paced, astonishingly beautiful and thematically rich journey through the evolution of man, with all of its accomplishments and missteps. The canvas is large, the themes it's dealing with are thought-provoking and the production is out of this world. As much as I love the film though, I have to point out the fact that this is not a picture that will please everyone. If you have a short attention span and are used to fast moving action, then most likely you will not appreciate the film. With that warning out of the way, let's get back to praising Kubrick's imposing work of art just a little longer. I'm not one to proclaim best ever about most anything. But in this case I will make an exception. As far as Science Fiction is concerned, there has never been a more groundbreaking and influential film. So on that basis, I considered the most important Science Fiction film of all time. It has been over five decades since Kubrick's masterpiece was made and to this day is still has no equal.",10,6,10,16 October 2019
Midsommar," Unlike any horror movie you have ever seen
","Strange, haunting, beautiful and unlike anything you have seen before. Midsommar does have some very disturbing moments but it is neither an extremely violent movie or an overtly scary one. The film has a subtle and unnerving intensity. Ari Aster does a great job of slowly cranking up the tension and weirdness level all the way to a shocking, disturbing and on some level, hopeful climax. And all of it is done under bright daylight, with strikingly colorful images and beautiful scenery. On the surface, Midsommar is a film about cults and folktales. But if you dig under the surface, this is really a film about loss, grief, family, belonging and caring. Dani, played with heartbreaking vulnerability by the young and talented Florence Pugh, suffers a terrible tragedy in the beginning of the film. She looks for emotional support from her somewhat aloof and uncaring boyfriend, played by Jack Reynor. Their unraveling relationship and her need for companionship and support is the crux of the story. And that is why the unforgettable ending is so bittersweet.",10,10,16,28 January 2020
Drag Me to Hell," Not scary or engrossing but it has its moments
","As a horror film, Drag Me to Hell is a failure. The film has very little tension and is not frightening. It has a couple of jump scares but a film like this needs a lot more to succeed. What was sorely missing was sustained tension and suspense. I was never invested in any of the characters or the story. And while there were isolated moments that worked and I would not go so far as call the movie boring, I will not call it an inspired effort either. What keeps it from being a total failure though, is the comedic aspects, its unpredictability and the ending, which almost made up for all of the mediocrity that came before it. Sam Raimi has had a mixed career and Drag Me to Hell is not one of his best.",5,1,2,8 June 2020
Mission: Impossible," The original Mission: Impossible has exciting visuals and stunt work and a strong central performance by Tom Cruise but is hurt by a mediocre plot
","The plot is preposterous but somewhat entertaining; it's also a bit too intricate for its own good. There are too many double-crossings and 'big revelations.' (some of which you could see coming a mile away) I have no problem with this type of filmmaking, as long its coherent and it all makes sense in the end. Unfortunately that is not the case here. Mission: Impossible's saving grace is its eye-catching special effects and stunt work. Two of the more memorable ones take place at CIA headquarters and on a train. Another positive aspect is the star of the film Tom Cruise, who does some fine work as Ethan Hunt; a character that would become one of his most memorable, in a film franchise that is still going strong after more than two decades. If you are a Tom Cruise fan and have watched his most recent MI films and want to see where it all started, then by all means go ahed and check this film out. If you are not a fan and are looking for a good action thriller there are much better options out there. This is not a bad film and it has its moments but its not going to blow you away either.",6,1,1,9 June 2020
A Clockwork Orange," A Dystopian Masterpiece
","Take the production value of 2001. Add the wit and dark humor of Dr. Strangelove. Throw in a bit of the old ultraviolence and what you have is A Clockwork Orange. Stanley Kubrick's dark, satirical and atmospheric film about free will, violence, authoritarian order and brainwashing. Kubrick, who has always been a filmmaker that prioritized look and sound over story, (But never in service to it) is in a league all by himself. The production is phenomenal and the atmosphere is intoxicating. Clockwork also boasts a terrific performance by Malcolm McDowell. His portrayal of the sociopathic and charismatic Alex, is one of cinemas most memorable. A film that pulls no punches. It takes shots at liberalism and authoritarianism and shows how easily the public can be swayed one way or the other. A though-provoking, funny, perverted, exceedingly violent and stylish motion picture. In short, a beautiful nightmare.",10,0,0,17 July 2019
Reservoir Dogs," Tarantino strikes gold with his first film
","As far as entertainment goes, you don't get much better than Reservoir Dogs. Tarantino's feature film debut is not a profound piece of work but it is bursting with energy and is a whole lot of fun. A witty, stylish, funny and bloody paranoid heist flick, that has a brisk pace, memorable characters and great dialogue. There is not much depth to the story; it's basically a robbery gone wrong, where the survivors end up in a warehouse and try to figure out who set them up. But when a movie is this much fun and this well made, having a light plot is not a hindrance to the overall quality. The performances by Keitel, (Mr. White) Roth, (Mr. Orange) Madsen, (Mr. Blonde) Buscemi, (Mr. Pink) Penn (Nice Guy Eddie) and Tierney (Joe Cabot) are intense, witty, funny and bursting with so much vitality, that they literally jump off the screen. Tarantino hits it out of the park with his first film. What a way to kick off a career that has now spanned for almost three decades. Every film that he has made since Reservoir Dogs owes a debt of gratitude to this indie darling that started it all.",9,0,0,18 August 2019
Pulp Fiction," A film that resurrected a couple of careers, put a couple of others on the map and made a star out of its director
","In terms of entertainment and style, few films can match Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. You can tell that this film is the work of a filmmaker that truly loves movies. Virtually every scene jumps at you with so much energy, wit and humor, that when it is all said and done, you leave the film with an emotional high. Pulp Fiction is not a film with a serious and thought provoking plot. What it is though, is a film that is built on sharp dialogue, cultural references, catchy tunes and strong performances from its talented ensemble cast. It resurrected Joh Travolta's and Bruce Willis' careers. And it gave Samuel L. Jackson and Uma Thurman their first big roles and made them into household names. As far as Tarantino is concerned, it proved to the critics that he was not a one hit wonder, and put him on the short list of one of the great up and coming directing talents. A career that has now lasted for almost three decades.",10,0,0,17 March 2020
Three Colors: Blue," A symphony of emotions
","Three colors: Blue, begins Krzysztof Kieslowski's three colors trilogy with an emotionally powerful film. In the hands of a lesser director, the subject matter could have turned into an overly sentimental work. But Kieslowski is much too good for that. What he gives us with Blue, is a devastating and moody story of loss, grief and rebirth, that is full of intense scenes of music, visuals and a tour de force performance by Juliette Binoche. Her sublimely understated performance is mesmerizing to watch. Kieslowski's spellbinding, melancholy, powerful and uplifting motion picture is gripping from start to finish. An outstanding way to start his trilogy.",10,1,1,7 August 2019
It's a Wonderful Life," If you are looking for a great Christmas movie, then look no further than the gold standard
","The perennial Christmas movie. It's a Wonderful Life is one of those rare films that is like a fine wine, it gets better with age. I watch this movie every Christmas and never get tired of it. A funny, sad and uplifting picture, for the whole family to enjoy. James Stewart is just about perfect for the role of George Bailey and gives a funny, quirky, sweet and heartwarming performance. He is supported by a talented cast and the sure-handed direction of Frank Capra. There are funnier and flashier Christmas movies out there but none are as well written, better acted and emotionally rich as It's a Wonderful Life. One of the all time great films.",10,0,0,28 December 2019
Rosemary's Baby," Haunting
","Underneath the demonic happenings, Rosemary's Baby possesses much more down-to-earth and scarier themes. Such as the fear of pregnancy, marital rape and man controlling woman's bodies. A suspenseful, chilling and haunting motion picture. Mia Farrow is sensational as Rosemary and the physical transformation she goes through is disturbing. Ruth Gordon is no less impressive as the nosy neighbor. Rosemary's Baby does a great job of building up the suspense. As the film moves along and gets peculiar by the minute, one cannot tell what's real or imagined. One of the all time great psychological horror films.",10,2,2,26 June 2019
Die Hard with a Vengeance," In terms of formula, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is more like a poor man's Speed than a 'Die Hard' movie
","For the majority of its runtime, Die Hard: With a Vengeance is the most exciting of the first three films of the franchise. But it all unravels with an underwhelming ending. For an action movie with this much energy to fizzle out towards the end is a big disappointment. Putting aside the ending and some silly plot holes, this Die Hard is an action-packed thriller, with plenty of humor and two terrific leads. Adding Samuel L. Jackson to the mix was a great casting choice. He brings a comic touch to the film that works like gangbusters and he has tremendous chemistry with Bruce Willis. Jeremy Irons is a competent villain but is hurt by the aforementioned ending. The third Die Hard is more akin to 1994's Speed than its previous two predecessors, although its not as good as Keanu Reeves' blockbuster",5,1,1,17 June 2020
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," An argument can be made that this is the best Star Wars film
","After two lackluster prequels, Revenge of the Sith closes out this three part chapter of Star Wars on a high note. Episode 3, has a dark and interesting plot, much better character development, the cheesy scenes are kept to a minimum and the film looks and sounds just as good as the first two. By far the best of the three films and arguably, the best Star Wars film up to that point. I know the original film was groundbreaking and has a special place in most peoples hearts but in terms of plot, acting, look and sound, Revenge of the Sith is the better film. With all that said, this is not a great movie. It does have issues but the good far outweigh the bad. A highly entertaining motion picture.",7,2,5,28 December 2019
The Shawshank Redemption," Pure Hollywood fantasy
","It is the performances that stand out in an overlong, sentimental and cliche film. The acting in this film is nearly flawless. Tim Robbins' understated performance is outstanding and Morgan Freeman is his equal. But to what end. Acting alone can not save a film that is overlong, (It feels like a 20 year sentence) has a hokey plot and cliche characters. Bob Gunton's insufferable Warden Norton and Clancy Brown's Captain Hadley, are as cliche as you can get. The Shawshank Redemption is a typical sentimental Hollywood fantasy, that takes itself way too seriously. As opposed to some of the more lighthearted and brisk Hollywood fantasies, which are far more easier to sit through..",5,1,2,14 August 2019
Parasite," Mr. Bong has concocted a first-rate black comedy
","Bong Joon-Ho, the writer and director of Snowpiercer, a dystopian Science fiction film about class divisions, tackles the same subject matter with his black comedy Parasite. The film centers on two families of four, on the opposite ends of the economic spectrum. Through the lens of comedy, Bong makes some socially poignant statements . He shows that not all rich people are cunning and not all poor people are dumb, lazy or unambitious. And he also shows that so much of life really comes down to chance and luck. You can plan all you want but life has a knack of throwing curveballs at you. And that is exactly what Bong does. The picture starts off as a simple comedy about class divisions, then, as it progresses, Bong throws one curveball after another. Ironically, as the film becomes more serious and violent, it also becomes a whole lot more funnier. An emotional roller-coaster of a movie. If there is one issue I have with the film, is that it may be a bit too long. I think it could have been edited a little better, because there are moments where the film does drag a bit. But that is a minor issue, in an otherwise excellent film, that is better than any American picture I have seen so far.",9,5,9,27 November 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," A rousing triumph
","At a time when it seems that all Hollywood is capable of producing are either cookie-cutter Superhero movies, silly Rom-com's or mindless action flicks, a refreshing and exciting film like Birdman comes along and gives you hope. Alejandro Inarritu's funny, smart and poignant picture stars Michael Keaton, who has never been better. A career resurgence for a guy who did not have a meaningful leading role in a long time. Edward Norton, Emma Stone and Naomi Watts are excellent in supporting roles. The innovative editing that made the film feel like it was one long shot, was ingenious. Birdman's engrossing multilayered plot tackles many subjects. Obsession, narcissism, show business' effects on family, the real world and the imaginary one and theater vs Hollywood, are all covered in this highly original, innovative and magical motion picture.",10,2,2,11 June 2019
Halloween," Highly overrated
","Halloween is all style and no substance, with very little meat on its bones. The sophistication of the story is at a teenage level. I guess You have to be at that age group, or have the mentality of a teenager, to actually enjoy a film like this. However, It is not just the childish, boring and highly predictable plot that hurts the movie. We also have very little character development and the acting is laughingly bad. In a film like this, if you have no investment in any of the characters and the antagonist has the charisma of a doorknob, you start loosing interest fast. When Michael starts his killing spree, you just want him to get it over as soon as possible. No amount of style can save a film with these many problems.",3,3,7,12 June 2019
Marriage Story," The 21st century version of Kramer vs Kramer
","Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver give two Oscar worthy performances, in this poignant, funny, sad and eventually somewhat uplifting picture, about a marriage falling apart. Sometimes two people just can not live together and divorce is the only logical option. Other times people call it quits way too quick. Whether Nicole and Charlie belong in the latter category or the former, is for each viewer to decide for themselves. Noah Baumbach, for his part, does a good job of presenting both points of view and never standing in judgment. Undoubtedly this is a film that will hit some harder than others but if you have a pulse, you will not come out of this experience unmoved. The only issue I have with the film is that some of the comic scenes mess with the tone. But that is a minor issue and does not hurt the film in a meaningful way. Marriage Story is not groundbreaking or fresh. We have seen this story before. But what Baumbach's film offers is a well-acted, heartfelt and poignant story, that in spite of its unoriginality, is still worth your time.",8,7,9,31 January 2020
Raging Bull," Unforgettable
","I have never seen a film about self-destruction this powerfully told and acted. Arguably the hight point of the storied careers of Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese. Raging Bull is the life story of Jake LaMotta, a winner inside the ring and a loser outside of it. Here is a man that had it all. LaMotta was a talented boxer that had money, a beautiful wife, a loyal brother and eventually threw it all away because of his paranoia, jealousy, insecurity and self-loathing. The cast is outstanding. De Niro's portrayal of Jake LaMotta is one of the all time great performances. I do not know of any other actor that gave a more emotionally intense and physically demanding performance. The jail scene where LaMotta has hit rock bottom, is hard to get out of your head. The boxing scenes are brutal and expertly shot and the black and white cinematography is exquisite. This film is not simply a contender, it's one of the all time great champions.",10,3,4,30 July 2019
Tombstone," Outside of Val Kilmer's performance, nothing else works
","Tombstone is an ambitious but highly flawed western, with a high production value and an all star ensemble cast. It had the potential to be an epic western. Instead what we got is a stylish but very problematic film. Part of the problem was hiring the dismally bad George P. Cosmatos to be the director. Mr. Cosmatos, whose claim to fame in America, was directing two Stallone flicks, (Rambo 2 and Cobra) proved once and for all, that he should not be anywhere near a respectable project. He would go on to direct one more atrocious film, before ending his not so illustrious career. But he was not the only problem. There was major issues with the script and casting. The end result is an unfocused and disjointed picture, with underdeveloped and uninteresting antagonists and female characters. The performances, with the exception of Val Kilmer, who is great as Doc Holliday, range from hokey to underwhelming. Tombstone is a big mess and a big disappointment.",3,4,11,11 June 2019
Blade Runner," A flawed masterpiece
","Part Neo-noir detective story, part cyberpunk science fiction and visually one of the most striking films ever made. There is an extraordinary world here to get lost in. Set in a dark, rainy, overpopulated dystopian Los Angeles, Blade Runner is a slow-burning picture about man's fruitless dream of achieving immortality and what it means to be human. I wish the film had a better thought-out story, instead of the somewhat contrived and sparsely plotted one we ended up getting. And I wish that the characters were better developed. Rutger Hauer's Batty was the best character in the film. Harrison Ford did a fine job as Deckard but he was not well written. Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah all played interesting characters but were underdeveloped. With all of its flaws, I still very much enjoyed the film. When a movie has this much detail in its world building and has such an intoxicating atmosphere, the lack of a strong plot and well developed characters does not hurt it very much. If you have not seen the film, just forget about the negatives and immerse yourself in one of the most unique and fascinating worlds ever created in film. And be sure you watch it on the biggest screen possible.",9,2,3,17 October 2019
Jojo Rabbit," An uneven but funny, heartwarming and impeccably produced and acted anti-hate satire
","If this was real life, Jojo would have most likely turned in Elsa and his mother. But since Taika Waititi's Jojo Rabbit is an anti-hate satire, being somewhat illogical and over-the-top is not a knock on the picture. And for those who find the whole enterprise to be offensive and in bad taste, I will reiterate the fact that this is a satire and one that has its heart in the right place. With that being said, let's get to the point. What did I think of Jojo Rabbit? I think it was a very good picture that accomplished most of what it set out to do. It was funny, provocative and had a good message. And it had outstanding production and performances. Waititi, Rockwell, Johansson and especially the kids, Davis and McKenzie were terrific in their roles. This is not a perfect picture. Not all of the scenes connected but most did. And the closing scene was just magical. If you are not easily offended, then ignore the naysayers and give Jojo Rabbit a chance.",8,2,3,26 February 2020
Speed," High-octane thrill ride
","The plot is absurd and it has its share of silly moments and a mustache twirling bad guy in an over-the-top Dennis Hopper. But all of that is beside the point, because Speed's job is not to present a realistic plot, or give us layered characters. Speed is an action thriller and its purpose is to thrill us. And it does a marvelous job at it. Jan de Bont's film is briskly paced, taut, action packed, edge of your seat thrill ride. This is also the movie that cemented Keanu Reeves as a leading action star and propelled Sandra Bullock into stardom. Speaking of Reeves and Bullock, they had tremendous chemistry together as Jack and Annie. Throw in a killer soundtrack and some strong supporting work by the talented Jeff Daniels and what we have here, is in my humble opinion one of the very best, if not the best action/thriller of the 90's.",9,1,1,6 June 2020
X2: X-Men United," X2 is more action-packed and is entertaining but it's not as good as the original
","Almost everything in X2 is done on a grander scale compared to its predecessor but that does not mean it's necessarily better. There is more action and more mutants but unfortunately some of the smaller character moments are drowned out by the heavy emphasis on action. This is not a negative review; on the contrary, I still enjoyed this slick and entertaining picture, just not as much as the original. Like the last film, the majority of the talented cast is in top form. Stewart, Jackman and McKellen are outstanding and the supporting cast is solid. My only complaint (like the last film) is Berry and Marsden, who are less than inspiring as Storm and Cyclops. If you are an X-Men fan and like action-packed superhero films, then X2 will not disappoint.",7,1,2,23 April 2020
Rear Window," Edge of your seat suspense
","Rear Window is a masterpiece of voyeurism and claustrophobic storytelling. Here is a film that slowly builds the suspense and paranoia and does it with style. The production is outstanding and gives the film an intoxicating atmosphere. Hitchcock masterfully puts us in the shoes of Jeff, (James Stewart) as he seats in his apartment and spies on his neighbors. Except for one instance, we see everything that Jeff sees, which includes a possible murder. From that point on, the film grabs a hold of you and leaves you at the edge of your seat until the very end. The casting is flawless. James Stewart is funny, likable and a little creepy as Jeff. Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter are excellent as his girlfriend and nurse. When it comes to suspense and entertainment, you don't get much better than this. A masterwork by the master of suspense.",10,0,0,5 September 2019
Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles," This could have been one of the best Vampire films of all time
","Interview with the Vampire is such a frustrating picture, because of what could have been. There is small doses of greatness, sprinkled here and there. But the film as a whole is underwhelming. The whole affair is a bit overlong and repetitious and quite frankly, there is not very much that happens in terms of plot. As far as casting is concerned, it is hit and miss. While I loved young Kristen Dunst's performance, (who I believe was the heart of the film) I was not that enamored with Tom Cruise's or Brad Pitt's. It looks like the casting of these two young, attractive and bankable stars was a ploy to draw in the female audience. Interview with the Vampire does have some winning attributes. Neil Jordan's gothic tale of a tortured vampires struggle with immortality, has a dark atmosphere and first-rate production. But as good as it looks and feels, the poor choice of the leads and the faults of the script hurt the picture a great deal. A flawed but somewhat interesting and stylish film.",5,0,3,16 August 2019
Moon," A major narrative flaw keeps this from being a top flight sci-fi movie
","On the one hand, Duncan Jones should be commended for trying to tell an intelligent science fiction story. At a time When most movies in the genre are brainless eye candy, this film is somewhat of a breath of fresh air. Unfortunately it does not succeed wholly. For a mystery and suspense film to work, you can not give away the payoff midway through. And if you do, like Vertigo did so many decades ago, then you better be real creative about it. For the first half, Moon was a tense and gripping sci-fi picture. Most of the intensity and mystery of the first half was gone by the second half, which drastically effected the quality. The movie coasted to a very predictable and anticlimactic ending. Sam Rockwell, playing two versions of himself gives an intense performance throughout. Only if the film was as consistent, we would have had something special on our hands.",6,2,5,15 June 2019
Mad Max: Fury Road," Action does not get any better than this
","A high octane, pedal to the metal, adrenaline rush. Mad Max: Fury Road, is a nonstop demolition derby of an action movie. It is stunning to look at and has some of the best choreographed action sequences ever filmed. But Fury Road is not only a feast for your eyes and ears. It also has some narrative heft and two terrific performances, by Tom Hardy and especially Charlize Theron. Theron's Furiosa, joins Ellen Ripley and Sarah Connor as one of the great female action heroines of all-time. If you are looking for a heart-pounding action extravaganza, that has more than a couple of brain cells and is not populated by stock characters, then look no further. Because Fury Road, is one of the best examples of the genre.",10,1,3,18 September 2019
Beetlejuice," Beetlejuice is not a story, it's a gimmick. The film is only interesting whenever Keaton and Ryder are on the screen.
","Tim Burton's wacky, supernatural tale takes a while to get going. It's not until Beetlejuice arrives on the scene that the film comes alive. And even though the film forgoes genuine character development and is actually not a story but a gimmick with some eye-catching (albeit somewhat dated now) visuals, it still has its moments thanks to Michael Keaton. He is at his manic best as the titular character. In fact, outside of Winona Ryder's gothic Lydia, he is the only other interesting character. Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis are less than stellar as Adam and Barbara, the two friendly ghosts who try to scare away the new inhabitants of their house. (Jeffrey Jones and Catherine O'Hara) Beetlejuice is yet another example of Tim Burton's shortcomings. While he is without a doubt a master of visual filmmaking, he is sorely lacking in the storytelling and character department.",5,3,8,15 April 2020
The Fighter," A good sports biopic with great performances
","The Fighter is a sports biopic, family drama and underdog story, about the former welterweight champion of the world, 'Irish' Micky Ward. And while the film is a contender, the real champion is the performances. Top to bottom, this is a superbly acted motion picture. Mark Wahlberg and Amy Adams are excellent as Ward and his girlfriend Charlene respectively. But it is Christian Bale, playing Dicky Eklund, Ward's crack addicted brother and former great boxer, that steals the show. Bale, being the chameleon that he is, totally immerses himself in the role and gives a funny, heartbreaking and uplifting performance. If you are a boxing fan or just like good old uplifting stories, with talented actors working at peak form, then The Fighter is just the movie for you.",7,0,0,1 April 2020
V for Vendetta," Only works as comic book fluff
","As a frivolous comic book movie, V for Vendetta is mostly an enjoyable ride. It has terrific production, with a dark and stylish atmosphere and a strong central performance by Natalie Portman. But outside of the limited scope of comic fluff, the film is a failure. The characters, with the exception of Portman's Evey and to a lesser degree, Stephen Ria's Finch are all two dimensional. John Hurt's Chancellor Sutler is a classic mustache twirling villain. As far as thematic richness, it's as deep as your average comic book. Its philosophical musings basically come down to authoritarian governments are bad and democracy and freedom are good. A very simplistic black and white outlook. And its all fed to us in a heavy-handed way, with all the subtlety of a bull in a china shop. If there is anything meaningful that can be take away from such a lightweight film, it's the moral bankruptcy of the whole enterprise. And i'm not just talking about terrorism and the ends justifying the means philosophy of V. What's really troubling is the serious case of Stockholm syndrome and brainwashing that the film is condoning. At best this is a silly comic book movie and can be enjoyed on that level. If taken any seriously, it becomes a paper thin and problematic film. If taken very seriously, it's dangerous.",5,1,2,23 April 2020
The Godfather," Legendary
","It has endlessly quotable dialogue and an iconic performance by Marlon Brando, as Don Vito Corleone. It also has one of the most memorable scores in motion picture history and some of the best acting you are ever going to see anywhere. In short, the Godfather is one of cinemas all-time great achievements. Francis Ford Coppola's gangster saga is as close to perfect as a film can get. There is not a false note to be found in this epic and gripping story of family, loyalty and the corrupting nature of power. They say that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and few films in history have been as imitated as the Godfather. A seminal work of American cinema.",10,0,0,4 September 2019
