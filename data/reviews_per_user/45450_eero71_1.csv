Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," This is the equivalent of pulling food pranks on starving African children
","I presented several screenings of this for various audiences comments. None of the audiences were willing to sit through the entire movie due to the unrelenting offensiveness and brainless antics. Twelve year old children act in the fashion Sasha Cohen displays. It is not insightful or creative or unique, rather it is lazy, unimaginative, and mean. If he was trying to trip Americans into saying or doing things that he could point his finger at, for the most part he fails. If he was trying to point out racial stereotypes that exist and use humor to combat them, his insistent offensiveness prevents that.This seems to be a classic example of critics saying 'it is a great movie and if you disagree you are not intellectually capable of seeing the nuance'. Well, making an ass of yourself and fools of others so that you can sell a movie without any worthwhile take away is not worth wasting $5-$10 dollars. This is an awful excuse of art and any self-respecting critic should be ashamed to try an label it as anything other than trash.",1,63,126,25 November 2006
