The Blair Witch Project," stupid movie
","this is the worst pile i've ever seen, something about mystical spirits or whatever and all the sudden they just disappear, so how did they find there equipment and no bodies? this movie is b/s and very badly produced since its a bunch of dumb kids with a video camera.if its real which its not, than its most likely a serial killer than some dumb Hollywood mystical b/s spirit world, all this religion and supernatural stuff needs to stop, we live in the 21st century we should be looking for answers, there's no such thing as miracles because EVERYTHING is possible regardless of your narrow minded thoughts on that issue, if you want to believe in something guess what....do no watch this movie, if you want scary watch a hostel movie or go to horror-fest, this is Hollywood b/s at its finest, making it look real but its really just a bad script or a bunch of kids get killed by a serial killer on the loose. sweet dreams kiddies",1,1,4,12 December 2007
