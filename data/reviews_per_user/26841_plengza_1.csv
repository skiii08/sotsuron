It," An Very Entertaining Film!!!
","(No spoilers) Did not expect much before stepping in the theater, turns out loving it so much! What makes this movie good? You'll love all the kids, they can make you smile and laugh out loud. You will care for them to overcome the monster. The characters is the key that makes this movie very entertaining to watch. There are also tons of jump scares throughout the movie, So if you think you might get bored for any second, No, you won't, i can guarantee that.The plot is nothing much new but still fine. Just Go see it. This movie is definitely not a wast of time.",10,7,16,8 September 2017
