Lucky Number Slevin," plot had a good twist to it.
","Acting was good. Too violent overall. Note: actor mykelti williamson was not shown on your list ofcredits. His name was shown on the credits at the end of the film itself. He had a small role but the way he was made up (false teeth type overbite) reminded you too much of how he looked in Forrest Gump. This took away from the seriousness of his character.The accent used by the character 'The Rabbi' was realistic and 'catchy'. Morgan Freeman was good as usual. The story line around the character played by Stanley Tucci was a bit weak: little far-fetched.Still, the plot kept you guessing.",6,0,7,9 April 2006
