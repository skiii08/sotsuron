Walk the Line," Superb
","Johnny and June were portrayed beyond perfection. I fell in love with them both, with their music, with their struggles, and with their lives. One of the best films to come out in the last 10 years. I would hope these two fine actors (Joaquin and Reece)make more films together as their on-screen chemistry, at least in this film, bests even Tracy and Hepburn. Then, of course, there's the soundtrack. I've been a fan of Johnny Cash for three decades and I think the singing style of the man in black was exceptional. Then Reece stepped up to the microphone and I was overwhelmed. If these two actors do not receive the Acadamy Award for their portrayals of both the Cash couple AND for their ability to sing I will be sorely disappointed.",10,0,2,1 December 2005
