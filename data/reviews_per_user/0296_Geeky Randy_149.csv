The King's Speech," Geeky Randy's summary
","Flawlessly constructed historical drama about King George VI (Firth) overcoming his stammer and the friendship that builds with speech therapist Rush in an equally memorable role. Helena Bonham Carter is great as The Queen Mother, and Freya Wilson is respectfully subtle as Elizabeth II--intentionally blending with Ramona Marquez as Princess Margaret. On location production, beautifully shot and Danny Cohen's cinematography is exceptional. The most admirable thing about this incredible film is that the climatic sequence is merely just a speech--and believe it or not, it's indeed intense. Terrifically done, Hooper. One of the best in years.**** (out of four)",10,0,0,26 July 2011
Insidious: Chapter 2," Its ham-handed attempt to make as much use of the reprising characters as possible is one of the saddest things a sequel has seen since OCEAN'S THIRTEEN
","The Lambert family returns to dig deeper into their connection to the spirited world. Scares ensue right from the get-go, but are nothing more than an insincere sham to set the tone of a film that has far less substance than its predecessor. The premise, however, is interestingly a mixture of a sequel, a prequel and a parallel (which covers events occurring at the same time as the first film). The film seems to be inadvertently broken into halves, the first of which covers Byrne's character and the second covering Wilson's, creating an overall incoherent horror movie. It actually gets pretty interesting during the second half, but when the first half is so dull, it's a lot to expect your audience to be so gracious and maintain an open-mind the entire film. There also seems to be an effort to make this installment 'the happier one of the series', and the ham-handed attempt to make as much use of the reprising characters as possible is one of the saddest things a sequel has seen since OCEAN'S THIRTEEN. Hopefully nobody will be reminded of this movie if someone ever decides to adapt HOUSE OF LEAVES to the screen.** (out of four)",5,0,0,30 September 2013
Scarface," What's All The Hype About?
","I hated this movie!  I don't think I hated it because it was bad, but because so many people thought it was good.  What was so good about it? There was no real plot, unless you consider; A crook from Cuba, who gets rich in America, by becoming a drug-dealer, and killing people.  That's not original.  There are plenty of movie out there that are like that, which are better.What I hear a lot of people say is that they liked this movie's ending the best.  I thought the ending was the worst part.**SPOILER AHEAD**A guy, who's mean to his wife, smuggles drugs, and kills his friends, die. Like I cared?  This guy was a jerk, and got what he was asking for, but HIS DEATH SCENE WAS CHEAP.  It was nothing original.  And they tried to make it seem tragic.  Like I gave a **** that he died.**SPOILER END**Also, I didn't think it was smart to cast an Italian guy to play a Cuban. I don't care if Pachino has 25% (if that) cuban in his blood, he looks Italian and he is considered an Italian.  Michelle Pfeiffer was a joke too.  She always cracks me up, when she tries to act sexy.  She's pretty, but she can't be sexy.1/10",2,29,60,11 March 2001
The Incredible Hulk," Geeky Randy's summary
","Wow. Who knew there would be so much eagerness to reboot the Hulk franchise only five years after Ang Lee's 2003 failure only to release an even bigger disaster. So now, after glossing over a new backstory in the lame opening credits, we have Edward Norton as Bruce Banner now, on the run while attempting to find a cure for himself before he is captured or before someone far less responsible than he obtains similar superpowers. While it should be embarrassing to reboot a story that was only done half a decade earlier, and that visual effects have not come all that far within that timeframe; what's worse than that and the lack of any other essential story elements is the simple fact that the plot does not MOVE. A mindless waste.* (out of four)",1,0,2,17 March 2015
The Monuments Men," Geeky Randy's summary
","Underrated war film directed, co-written, co-produced and starring George Clooney as Lt. Frank Stokes (loosely based on George L. Stout) who recruits six men to help him track down great works of art that Hitler has been stealing for a personal museum. With John Goodman and Bill Murray in tow, the movie easily hits most of its laughs with excellent timing, while at the same time also delivering sincerity in its message. Unfortunately, the moral of the story might be overlooked by the masses; you probably need to have a great appreciation for art or be an artist yourself to fully appreciate this movie. However, the film's greatest downfall is that the comedic moments do not segue well into dramatic moments, and vice versa. Clooney requested to have the release of this film pushed a couple of months, causing it to miss out on deserved Oscar buzz. Loosely based on the non-fiction book, THE MONUMENTS MEN: ALLIED HEROES, NAZI THIEVES AND THE GREATEST TREASURE HUNT IN HISTORY by Robert M. Edsel.*** (out of four)",7,1,2,26 May 2014
Antz," Teaching collectivism and individualism to kids
","In an ant colony in Central Park, a neurotic ant Z-4195 (voiced by Woody Allen, which goes without saying is perfect casting), or 'Z' for short, attempts to steal the heart of Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) while also freeing himself from an oppressive culture. Looking beneath surface, this film can be seen as an interesting and safe take on collectivism-versus-individualism. Some of the ants' faces share similarities to the actors who voiced them. Casual swearing—rare for many animated films at the time—earned this outing a PG-rating, along with some intense action; though, for the most part, it's probably fine for all ages.*** (out of four)",7,0,0,25 January 2015

The Expendables 2," Add yet another sequel to the inferior list.
","Follow-up to the 2010 action/adventure, this time with more stars and more action. Another sequel that fails to see that more isn't always merrier. Just like in the first, Stallone and Statham are the only ones with any purpose while the rest of the group is just there because they were once popular tough guys. Rourke's absence creates a void, though his character didn't do much in the first movie anyway—his uselessness is actually substituted with Chuck Norris' couple walk-on cameos that add nothing to the story; and Li annoyingly gets third billing again despite his character being drastically smaller than in the first film. It's nice to see Schwarzenegger and Willis' characters expanded though. Jean-Claude Van Damme joins the cast as the main antagonist; however, a guy like him should have been a way better bad guy than Eric Roberts was. The first film was refreshing because it didn't fall into the trap of corny lines, and the setting was original and interesting; unfortunately, this film does not have the same quality. The climax is especially lame. No sign of Giselle Itié; instead, we are introduced to Yu Nan, who briskly shoves herself into the movie like a token Bond girl. Must the women in these films be so expendable (no pun intended)? Add yet another sequel to the inferior list.** (out of four)",5,1,4,5 October 2012
Skyfall," Geeky Randy's summary
","23rd Bond film is easily the strongest of the three Daniel Craig movies, with this installment abandoning all plans for the direct-sequel route that QUANTUM OF SOLACE took and going for the traditional episodic contribution. In this outing, we have Bond trying to track down former MI6 operative Raoul Silva (played by Javier Bardem, who's as good as always) whose mastermind attacks are all motivated by good-old-fashioned revenge. This film is notable for M (played by Dench) having a greatly increased role, and is the reboot's introduction to key recurring characters such as Q and Moneypenny. Also, the only Bond film with a title that was not somehow influenced by the title of one of Fleming's books. The scenic shots of Shanghai are tremendous, and the action sequences in the London Underground are perfectly nail-biting. This one knows how to pace itself without being too much nor too little.*** (out of four)",8,2,6,18 January 2014
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Geeky Randy's summary
","The first installment into the Indiana Jones Series, which follows the archaeologist/adventurer to Nepal and Egypt for the search of biblical artifact The Ark of the Covenant. Groundbreaking picture; a roller coaster ride of a movie, with premium action sequences—but it fails to give the viewer any room to breathe. Ford is absolutely wonderful and irreplaceable as Dr. Jones, but neither Allen or her character Marion Ravenwood can earn the same keep as the main character. While the film succeeds in fun and thrilling entertainment, there's no excuse for the action in your climatic sequence to be far more inferior than the nail-biting close-calls that preceded it. Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies are SO underused.**½ (out of four)",6,0,3,22 June 2010
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Geeky Randy's summary
","Live-action/cartoon combo classic, based on Wolf's 1981 novel WHO CENSORED ROGER RABBIT?, in which private inspector Hoskins investigates a murder where the prime suspect is the title character. Lots of great performances and countless fun cameos that include Disney and Warner characters sharing the screen together for the first time ever. A favorite for many; the film's greatest quality is its timelessness. However, Leonard Maltin summed up the film's fatal flaw terrifically in his capsule, pointing out that it is terribly difficult for even the most open-minded viewer to acclimate to a world where humans and cartoons live together. The MPAA would never rate it PG today.**½ (out of four)",6,0,3,9 March 2014
Gravity," Geeky Randy's summary
","To-the-point and dull-free tale of astronaut Bullock trying to make her way back to Earth safely after an accidental mid-orbit destruction of a shuttle leaves her stranded in outer space. Effects-driven (but what space odyssey isn't?), but charmingly simplistic when it all comes right down to it, with a story and cast that makes it worth your while. Maybe striving for a protagonist slightly more theatrical would remedy the film's interchangeable choice of casting—though all the actors involved do an undeniably satisfying job. Kudos for being a 3D film that has just as much appeal in 2D. Worth seeing.★★★ (out of four)",7,0,1,28 February 2014

","Superbly crafted mystery about two detectives, one a veteran (Freeman) one a rookie (Pitt), on the hunt for a serial killer inspired by the seven deadly sins. Isn't dated and is an instant classic. Ermey and Paltrow are well-cast as supporting characters. Scary, thrilling, memorable; but predictability is nearby, and even the climatic twist doesn't appear to be as shocking as intended. Some of the characters' back-story (specifically Freeman's) seems to be overly developed and completely unnecessary to the plot at hand. Still a terrific pulls-no-punches crime-thriller that made David Fincher a recognized director, and rightfully so!***½ (out of four)",9,0,1,30 March 2011
The Big Lebowski," Geeky Randy's summary
","Bridges plays Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski, an unemployed slacker with very simple taste: bowling, marijuana, White Russians, and a rug that ties the room together. When thugs mistake him for Jeff 'The Big' Lebowski (Huddleston) and 'vandalize' the Dude's rug, he seeks compensation from the Big Lebowski; but by the time an agreement is reached, the Dude finds himself in the crossfire of a conflict involving kidnappers and the Big Lebowski's much younger wife (Reid). Above par upon first viewing, but the replay value is unmatchable and will eventually wind up at the top of your favorite comedies. Along the lines of other Coen Brothers comedies, but this one is easily the best. Layered with terrific minor characters played by an exceptional supporting cast.

This is how he meets Tyler Durden (Pitt). Unconventional plot faithfully adapted from Palahniuk's debut novel of the same name with an equally unique 'mind's eye view' storytelling approach from Fincher, this brutal flick will surely grow on the male viewers, while also making you second guess the world in which we live in. Unexpectedly groundbreaking, and rightfully considered a classic despite its ability to be misinterpreted.**** (out of four)",10,0,2,5 January 2015

","A misanthropic writer (Nicholson) finds inspiration to change for the better after falling in love with a waitress (Hunt) and fostering a dog for a neighbor who's been hospitalized (Kinnear). Nostalgic (look at the gas prices!) but also timeless, with an all around charm from the three leads plus the supporting cast consisting of Gooding, Herwick, Kennedy, Knight, Smith and Ulrich. The dosage of comedy is far more potent than the drama and romance, allowing for a chemistry that perfectly dodges anything too far-fetched or overemotional. The Baltimore and New York settings also add an element of class to this long-but-not-boring outing of proudly unusual friendships and love.

Inglourious Basterds," Easily Tarantino's best since PULP FICTION.
","WWII revenge fantasy about a group of Nazi-hunters led by Pitt. Gets better with each viewing despite all the gore. Both the well-known and unknown actors are excellent in their roles; however, it goes without saying that Waltz easily steals the show as the charming opportunistic sociopath SD Standartenführer Hans 'The Jew Hunter' Landa, possibly the greatest character Tarantino has ever written. Lots of subtitles, but that's a good thing as it helps in authenticating an otherwise alternate history; though, admittedly, it does get a little too dialogue-driven (if there's such a thing in a Tarantino picture) during Chapter 4's 'Who Am I' Drinking Game—but the movie is otherwise, as Landa would say, 'Bravo'. The soundtrack—a first of Tarantino's not to feature dialogue— uses a variety of music genres, including spaghetti western soundtrack excerpts and R&B; all of which is a strange but wonderful fit. Easily Tarantino's best since PULP FICTION.

By-the-book martial arts flick is a tolerable time-killer, but Anderson and Chan's characters risk so much for nothing—what is their motivation?

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Fantasy Failure
","In an era where fantasy books can be satisfyingly transferred into film, it was to be expected that the C.S. Lewis's classic 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe' would be brought to life too. And it was. But without justice.'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy and the 'Harry Potter' heptalogy were as successful as possible. 'Narnia', on the other hand, didn't seemed to put forth as much effort as the others. The technology used in the film didn't create the same magic as the other fantasy-stories did. As the film progressed, it became abundantly clear that 'Narnia' was nothing more than a competition to 'Lord' and 'Harry' (with an obviously smaller budget).Many people impressed with the film can argue that it was entertaining and enjoyable. This is all fine and dandy. However, it is mere fact that the film's creators didn't go about the project with the love and passion for the story like those of 'Lord' and 'Harry'. The campy special effects, the underdeveloped characters, and the fact that the 'Narnia' film-series is going to be abridged by four book leads to the conclusion that this is done for nothing more than profit.For those who are bored and looking for something to do, you may enjoy this lazy excuse for a film. But for those who want to be impressed as they were with 'Lord' and/or 'Harry', wish to see a wonderful classic brought to life on screen, or just like seeing special-effects, you will be greatly disappointed.",1,7,16,4 January 2008
Batman Returns," 'Returns' is why Burton wasn't welcome back for the third installment.
","The first, but not best, follow up to the successful 'Batman' includes two villains: Catwoman (Pfeiffer) and an unnecessary hideous rendition of The Penguin (DeVito). Keaton puts the cape on a second time for a wonderfully meek Batman/Bruce Wayne. Director Tim Burton, however, appears to be more interested in doing things the way he wants, instead of even attempting to continue a good story. The first was a darker and realistic take on a superhero that most be associated Adam West with — but the darkness and reality of the 1989 film worked well. Here, however, Burton tries to make 'Returns' darker, uglier and less realistic. Instead of The Penguin being a beak-nosed mobster who wears a tuxedo, he's a mutated human living in the sewer. Instead of Catwoman being everybody's favorite anti-hero, she's wicked enough to be the main villain. Instead of Billy Dee Williams reprising his role as Harvey Dent, he's replaced with Christopher Walken as the evil Max Shreck — a new character who looks more like a mad scientist than a corrupt businessman. Even the art design of Gotham City is significantly different and less believable than the first. Burton completely ruined the wonderful world he made in the previous film. Danny Elfman's score is the only thing this and the first film are equal at; everything else is significantly inferior. A huge disappointment.** (out of four)",4,4,7,29 January 2010

When he arrives in Sandford, he notices petty laws continuously being broken and commonly hears the phrase, 'The greater good.' This all starts to add up when citizens of Sandford begin dying in tragic accidents. Frost is terrific as Pegg's dim-witted partner, and Bill Nighy is perfect in the bit role of the chief inspector. Plenty of laughs, plenty of blood, but perhaps a little too much action during the conclusion (probably a little overlong too). Still a classic in its own right, Pegg/Frost team continues to satisfy, and the film is still hilarious after several viewings.

Focuses more on the group of boys, but Williams is able to work his off-the-cuff dialogue enough to keep you reminded that it's still him. Absolutely beautiful Northeastern setting, with excellent enough pacing to keep you entertained the entire way through. The boys are surprisingly less dorky than you'd think.

The real fun (and danger) comes when the youngster decides that he's 'the man of the house' and challenges two dim-witted burglars Pesci and Stern with a funhouse of traps (some slapstick, others legitimately harmful). Writer/producer Hughes and director Columbus do a pretty good job of working around the incompetency of the whole fiasco—but a lot of things in the film comes together so well thanks to an underrated supporting cast, particularly Bamman, Blossom, Heard and O'Hara.

John Connor suffered a recast yet again, this time with A-list actor Christian Bale. Only an actor as talented as Bale could be taken seriously as a recast. A more solemn story, but has plenty of spectacular action scenes (though nothing groundbreaking). It is what it is: not a classic, but rather just a Terminator story but it's a great story!

Cleverly marketed, immensely unpredictable, and never ever dull.

Arnold Schwarzenegger plays the title role, a cyborg sent back through time to kill the mother (Hamilton) of a then-unborn resistance leader that would defeat the invading Terminator-race in the future. Michael Biehn plays an unlikely but well-done hero, with Henriksen, Boen and Winfeld as the unexpected comedic relief that lacked in the sequels. The story suffers from a paradox you could drive a big rig through; the special-effects weren't that far ahead of its time; and the soundtrack may have suited the mood for 1984, but it ended up dating poorly. Schwarzenegger fits the role perfectly. Originally, Henriksen was supposed to play the Terminator.

","It's funny when the trailers, posters and other movie-advertisements make a film look cornier than it actually is.

A tight-knit group of mercenaries go to Vilena to stop an evil ex-CIA officer (Roberts) who is using a powerful general (Zayas) as a puppet to dictate the small helpless island. The setting, design, style and tone of the film are all superb; and while the action is above-par, it gets a bit cartoonish and fails to be mind-blowing. While the acting and choice of casting is exceptional, the characters are either cliché, hypocritical or both—Zayas seems to be the only actor amongst the large ensemble that brings to life a character convincingly conflicted and three-dimensional. The amount of characters is completely unnecessary, with most of them lacking any purpose—even Mickey Rourke can't seem to earn his keep despite having a terrific monologue mid-film.

Accompanied by a new partner (Ruffalo), Teddy begins to question whether they're investigating an escapee or if the patients and staff on Shutter Island are involved in a conspiracy that will hinder their investigation and even their safety. The film neither starts nor ends on a high note, there is no peak in this 'thriller', and the clichéd choppiness of the filming in order to create a sense of delusion ceases to impress in the slightest. From the beginning, you know how this one will end. The splendid acting by all actors, including even those who are portraying minor characters, is grade A; and the claustrophobic mood of being stuck on the beautiful, but creepy, Shutter Island is where Scorsese's talent can be seen.

","Hands down, an undisputed modern-day classic about Police Chief McDormand unwittingly on the trail of kidnappers for a seemingly unrelated triple-homicide.

Lots of great minor characters on both McDormand and Macy's sides of the story.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," The greatest fantasy film of all-time
","An absolutely gorgeous adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum—while TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe—the movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath.

This one tries too hard with the SFX and thrills, and it's understandable because the story lacks any reason and sense. Hugo Weaving was spectacular in the original as Agent Smith, but in this one the Wachowski brothers literally multiply the character infinitely; a desperately cheap attempt to outdo what worked so great for the original.

","After nearly twelve years, a third installment was finally made. While certainly inferior, it had so many obstacles to overcome legally and financially that we're lucky we even got a film at all — and in the end; at least they did the best they could. Arnold looks like he hasn't aged a bit since 'T2' and that alone must've been a lot of work. There's an obvious void with the absence of Cameron and Hamilton, and Nick Stahl is a poor recast of Furlong. The T-1000 is replaced with T-X (Loken), a female terminator that is dangerous and sexy, but she can't live up to Robert Patrick's nearly invincible villain. The story is well-written, with a decent attempt at explaining away any holes left in 'The Terminator', but it fails to recognize important plot points from 'T2'. The self-awareness of the filmmakers knowing it's an inferior film makes 'T3' an entertaining, fun and even humorous journey. The special effects live up to 'T2' and the story's outcome is unpredictable. It's sometimes darker than the first two, sometimes lighter; at some points better, at other points inferior.

","Tragedy meets melodrama meets the fearless hip '90s, following the Burnham family as they deal with their first-world problems. Lester and Carolyn (Spacey and Bening) are getting older, and both are trying in their own way to hang on to the last moments of what each thinks is the prime of their lives; while their teenage daughter Jane (Birch) is having issues of her own, dealing with finding her identity and not feeling pretty enough next to her 'friend' Angela (Suvari). Neighboring Fits family (consisting of Bentley, Cooper and Janney) work their way into the mix because the son is stalking Jane. A film that speaks to those who have seen a midlife crisis, and is still entertaining to those who have it to look forward to. Oscar-winner is entertaining right from the get-go, and is an experience as flawless as a rose upon first viewing. However, after you've seen it a few times, the rose begins to wilt, unmasking contradictory characters and inexplicable events that unfold just to appease its themes of confinement, conformity, redemption and sexuality—why does Lester lecture Carolyn about materialism right after HE's the one that bought a Pontiac Firebird? Why didn't writer Ball or director Mendes at least try to make Bening's character slightly redeemable? All the many other questions to raise require spoilers, but the list goes on...

Terminator 2: Judgment Day," The greatest action film of all-time. The greatest sci-fi of all-time. The greatest thriller of all-time!
","A follow up to Cameron's successful 'The Terminator', this time the Terminator's mission is to protect not terminate. Maybe it should be called 'The Protector'? The bond between the Terminator and the person he's programmed to protect — John Connor (Furlong, in his debut role), the son of the preceding film's target — is actually touching. Only Cameron can pull that off. Linda Hamilton reprises her role as a much darker and tougher Sarah Connor and Earl Boen reprises his role as a more important (and less likable) Dr. Silberman. Is it purposely ironic that the good characters from the first one grow dark in this film, and the dark character from the first one turns good in this film? Regardless of its intention, it works. The T-1000 (Patrick) is the cherry on top (the T-1000 makes 'The Abyss' look like a student project). 139 minute action/sci-fi/thriller isn't long it's epic!

The two leads do an excellent job of showing their characters' instability without ever being overly-dramatic or pity-party about it. The story is grounded in reality very well, but the romantic climax falls into place a little too easily. De Niro, Herman, Kher, Mihok, Ortiz, Stiles, Tucker and Whigham are all terrific in their supporting roles, but it seems like Weaver might let her Australian accent slip and is definitely not convincing as a Philly homemaker.

","One of Apatow's signatures is to really dig deep into his characters; which, for a comedy, sometimes ends up turning things unexpectedly serious and/or surprisingly heartwarming. For FUNNY PEOPLE and KNOCKED UP, toying with drastic genre shifts was tolerable because there was at least payoff with good jokes and interesting characters. However, in his 2005 outing about sweet but overly awkward Carell, there is a major lack of satisfaction when attempting to explore the root-causes of why our main character just can't (or won't) 'get any'. The jokes are few-and-far-between, but when they are finally delivered, it is so juvenile that actual 40-year-old virgin aren't even this desperate for a laugh.

At times, the dialogue is just as bad as Woo's second installment; but from the opening scene of Cruise climbing on the outside of a flying Airbus A400M (without the use of special effects or a stunt double, by the way), there's no doubt another impossible mission will accomplish your entertainment. It's nice to see reprising characters getting fleshed out a little more, and the minor references to previous films are indeed fun; but this excellent series runs the risk of slowing down if each installment is becoming less and less self-contained.

Aliens," Would've work better as its own film instead of a sequel
","Sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi/horror films ever made—a genre so difficult to execute so wonderfully—comes along and sucks out any horror aspect that made 'Alien' so fantastic. Instead, James Cameron replaces Ridley Scott in the director's seat and inserts sci-fi clichés and predictable thriller aspects, resulting in this overlong and unnecessary picture.Cameron seems to spend a good length developing characters that are either unlikable and just there for the sake of dying, with a total disregard for driving the story forward. Even in comparing character development to 'Alien', the sequel proves weaker. 'Alien' was able to develop deeper and realistic characters in a much shorter timeframe, and didn't need more characters than the story required.Anything new to Cameron's picture is nothing more than convenient plot-devices, thus lacking any shred of cleverness. Aside from Weaver's presence, the film hardly reminds us of the original. The film leaps too forward without any respect for its roots, totally lacking gratefulness.At no point in the film is it easy to actually point out how 'Aliens' is a necessary/needed follow up. The film may very well have worked better as it's own with all new characters and no continuity to 'Alien', but it simply just doesn't work as a follow up; which is actually disappointing because if you want to look at what a 'good' sequel is, Cameron accomplished it with 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'. Everything on which the story stands relies on 'The Terminator', however it doesn't need the 'remember when's to move forward. With 'Aliens', the story itself is not heavily relied on by 'Alien', and again, pretty much Weaver is our only feeling of continuation. And again, given the fact that it's just a small and irrelevant reminder, the movie simply doesn't work as a sequel but rather a film of it's own. The fact of the matter is, it's not a film of its own; 'Aliens' is a sequel, and it simply wasn't done right.Was it entertaining? Sure, whatever. But upon examining filmmaking basics, however, the film fails at the follow up aspect story-wise and goes way off in a direction of its own. That's not a bad thing if it's an original movie. It's not even a bad thing for a sequel of the film shows heavy purpose in the decision to ranch off.After watching 'Aliens', if the question rose: 'Why does this particular story need to be a follow up to 'Alien'? What is it about 'Alien' that this film needs to be in the same continuity?' The answer is that it doesn't. 'Alien' was a successful film, therefore the studio can have a head-start at making another film by throwing in meaningless nods and references to the successful film preceding it in hopes that this film ('Aliens') will be just as successful. Cameron probably wouldn't even be able to give a solidly confident contradiction to this claim.** (out of four)",4,6,12,2 September 2010

","Nolan couldn't have been a better choice to take the director's seat, and while Bale has a strong resemblance to West, their Batmans are completely different. After eight years of silence, the Batman reemerges with a most appropriate reboot which explains the whole history of how Bruce Wayne became Batman. Nolan makes both Burton and Schumacher look like Ed Wood — most impressive of all is that, while technology has improved tremendously since 1997's flop 'Batman & Robin', 'Begins' chooses to take little advantage of it. A-list actors are casted as supporting characters, with Michael Cane as Alfred, and a calm Gary Oldman (that's a first!) as Gordon; among others like Liam Neeson, Katie Holmes and Morgan Freeman. Tom Wilkinson, Rutger Hauer, Ken Watanabe and Colin McFarlane are also so wonderful in their minor roles. Cillian Murphy modestly appears as The Scarecrow, which one can say is a bit underused as a well-known villain, but it actually makes it all the more realistic.

Outside of the serious scenes, the film is an otherwise lighthearted portrayal of the lavish life Liberace pursued with a companion that he was forced to pretend was his adopted son instead of his partner or husband. Really good film for the masses; but at the end of the day, it's still another gay-movie made by straight people—it didn't work when white people were writing sitcoms about black families, why do straight people think they can properly execute a meaningful story about gay people?

Django Unchained," Even from a critical standpoint, at least 75% of the film is terrific and most shortcomings are only skin deep.
","Spaghetti Western—or is a Spaghetti Southern more appropriate?—about slave-turned-bounty hunter Foxx and companion/mentor dentist-turned-bounty hunter Waltz making their flesh-for-cash living, ultimately ending up at the Candyland Plantation to rescue Django's estranged wife Washington. Very much a Tarantino film, delivering homages to the genre in the same manner as 'KILL BILL: VOL. 2' and 'INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS'; however, this addition to Tarantino's impressive filmography as director/writer is possibly the least dialogue-driven, even more so than 'KILL BILL: VOL. 1'. To some who did not care for or are not familiar with 'RESERVOIR DOGS' and 'PULP FICTION', this may not be a disappointment. On the other hand, viewers/fans who are very much familiar with Tarantino's style of making full use of his actors' words, expressions and interactions—a style which has gained him much praise—might be slightly let down that 'DJANGO UNCHAINED' is more about visuals and less about emotion. Well-acted, with plantation owner DiCaprio and his head slave Jackson offering the most memorable performances. Foxx is great, but delivers an interchangeable performance; and Waltz is more than charming, but his talents are put to very similar use as in 'INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS'. Neither Foxx nor Waltz should be criticized as they obviously gave it their best; perhaps the problem is that the two lead roles are two-and-a-half-dimensional characters—not quite two-dimensionally dull and not quite three-dimensionally gripping they are both caught in that invisible world between script and screen. The film's flaws are not quite apparent until the climatic sequence, a point of the film that changes from slick and stylish to complete sloppiness. Did they use red dye and varnish for the blood or what? But even from a critical standpoint, at least 75% of the film is terrific and most shortcomings are only skin deep.*** (out of four)",7,4,13,29 December 2012
Drive," Geeky Randy's summary
","Gosling plays an LA stuntman who moonlights as a heist getaway driver in this wittingly modest thriller. Anti-hero protagonist adds edginess à la TAXI DRIVER, while characters are linked to action in very cool realism not unlike PULP FICTION. Nice payoff for an underwhelming year of film. Unfitting soundtrack works surprisingly well, and even has a haunting effect that may not be intention but is still perfect. MPAA forced director Refn to trim one scene heavily to achieve an R-rating; hasn't everyone seen IRREVERSIBLE yet, who are we sheltering?

Don't forget the loving trolls and the hilarious snowman Olaf in tow. Takes a good 10–20 minutes to actually grab you, and is less for the boys than it is the girl. Musical numbers, while catchy and well-written, occur too frequently a few which do very little to help drive the plot. Another big-budget with all razzle-dazzle and little heart; however, this outing is worth the wasted time and money in comparison to others that fit the same criticism.

The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Inferior, but still worth it
","The adventure continues with two separate stories (readers of the book will notice that the stories have been sandwiched together): one with Aragorn (Mortensen), Gimli (Rhys-Davies) and Legolas (Bloom) on the trail of orcs who have kidnapped hobbits Pippin (Boyd) and Merry (Monaghan); the other with Frodo (Wood) and Sam (Astin) making their way to Mordor accompanied by troublesome guide Gollum (Serkis). No longer obscured by the shadows, Serkis almost steals the movie when brought to the foreground. While undeniably more action-packed than FELLOWSHIP (fans particularly love the intense Helm's Deep battle), this movie is really the start of the corny-lines and moments-of-boredom that plague the rest of Peter Jackson's Middle-Earth films. Hill and Otto are frustrating as the hope-driven king and princess of Rohan. Regardless of how disappointingly inferior it is compared to FELLOWSHIP, it makes for an excellent story-bridge between its predecessor and the following RETURN OF THE KING.

Schindler's List," Certainly a movie to judge for yourself.
","The critically acclaimed epic story of a Nazi (Neeson) who witnesses the atrocities bestowed upon Polish Jews during the brutal Nazi Reign. Ooh, Spielberg is so genius with his use of coloring and his pulls-no-punches portrayal of WWII! Just the type of film Hollywood loves to pat themselves on the back for and tell themselves that they're edgy and honest. However, the reality is, the use of symbolism in this film is so shallow, even a sixth grader can interpret its meaning. What's the point of symbolism if there's nothing to search for? It seems a bit redundant, because any meaning behind this film, aside from the ugliness the Jewish people endured during WWII and the sacrifices Schindler made, is there on the screen. There's nothing to search for. There's no ambiguity for each individual to take something personal away from it. The symbolism serves no purpose. Not to mention other Spielberg flaws; he underestimates his audience as usual, and continues the story when its finished as usual. Keep in mind when watching that not everything in this 'masterpiece' is historically accurate. Ralph Fiennes chooses to play Amon Göth as a theatrical villain, rather than a three dimensional evil and twisted man. Christopher Waltz makes Fiennes look like an amateur as Hans Landa in 'Inglourious Basterds'. That's another thing, why is this in English? Is it so Hollywood doesn't have to read subtitles, while the rest of the world has to? Certainly a movie to judge for yourself.** (out of four)",5,3,9,3 March 2010

","Worthy sequel to the 2012 blockbuster about Hill and Tatum taking their 'skills' as narcs from high school to college. The chemistry definitely works better here, with the two leads bickering like a married couple instead having a bully/nerd team like in the first film. Quite predictable in the first half, but begins taking unexpected turns midway through and leaves you laughing to its unpredictable ending. Ice Cube really steps it in this one and makes an effort to move in as the third main character, and his subplot is perhaps the best part about this film.

Amadeus," 'There are too many notes.' There are too many scenes.
","Shaffer adapts his play into film, which chronicles composer Antonio Salieri (Abraham) and his plot to ruin Amadeus Mozart (Hulce). Historically inaccurate, but then again it's not a biography. Even though Salieri knows Mozart is a genius, his jealousy craves the ranting towards Mozart's music, such as the Emporer's (Jones) criticism of one of Mozart's pieces having 'too many notes'. It appears Forman and Shaffer should have taken their own advice, as the film starts to drag significantly during the second half, mainly due to drawn out opera scenes. As the film comes to an end, the viewer can't help but feel satisfied by, not only a well-told story, but also (and more importantly) the brilliance of music contained in the film. Hulce was extremely critical about playing music, with musical scholars complimenting that every note of music matches that seen on screen, which is both a film and musical triumph!***½ (out of four)",8,2,4,1 February 2010
Kick-Ass," Hit the right spot for some, but not for everyone.
","Adaptation of 2008 creator-owned comic book of the same name, about a teenage boy (Johnson) who sets out to become a superhero. His actions are caught on camera, via witnesses' cellphones, and uploaded onto the internet, making him an inspiration. However, he soon gets pushed into the crossfire of an ongoing war between gangsters and ruthless vigilantes that are killing the thugs off one by one. The film starts out very promising, with real life obstacles as a major (and many times humorous) setback for the main character. However, what starts out as something comical and self-aware soon turns into a heartless tale of vigilantism. It's pretty much Marvel's answer to Christopher Nolan's Batman Trilogy, but it brings nothing new to heroism in the real world. The film soon begins focusing too much on the violence and cruelty of the world, rather than focusing on the main character's realization of why people choose not to become superheroes in the real world--an epiphany brought on by a more interesting sub-plot involving a crush who thinks he's gay. Still, the film hit the right spot for a lot of people, but not everyone. Just another example of why Marvel is inferior and shallow compared to DC.*½ (out of four)",4,3,8,17 May 2011

","Two men (Mackie and Geraghty) question their loyalty to their Army bomb squad when a reckless Sergeant First Class (Renner) takes over in the final five weeks of their tour in Iraq. A gripping story and a talented cast. But you have to wonder where the film is going. There are no memorable characters like Brando's Col. Kurtz from 'Apocalypse Now' or Emery's Gny. Sgt. Hartman from 'Full Metal Jacket', which is fine if you have an untold story but even the film fails at that. There's nothing notable about this story or its characters. What this film contains are your average Joes, in everyday war situations. One can argue that there's nothing wrong with that. But you have to wonder, why not just make a documentary instead? In fact, the film may have been perfect had it been a documentary. But it wasn't. Instead, they waste three strong actors by giving them bland characters and (worst of all) pointless cameos from A-list actors that didn't move the story along at all. So what it has come down to is that it's documentary-like except it's actually just another filmmaker's interpretation, which we've all seen before.**½",6,1,6,7 February 2010

","Contemporary effort of the now-legendary 1981 Raimi film is refreshing at first, but finds itself being overlong once all the gore and scares have peaked in the middle. The story-differences between the old and new films create an intensity that gives fans from the original series an equal amount of jolts as the newcomers, and the cast is slightly more likable than your typical horror film—though that's still not saying a whole lot, unfortunately. The opening scene is completely unnecessary, even though it was pretty cool. The main issue with this film is the main issue with many remakes modernization. And the main issue with modernization is that itself will one day be outdated, not unlike its inspiration. Thus, pointlessness. The different ending doesn't change anything either; nice try. If the objective was to place the audience in Hell for 90 minutes, mission accomplished; but there is a feeling of emptiness when camp and low-budget are absent from an Evil Dead story.** (out of four)",4,27,52,14 April 2013

Prisoners," Includes all the great qualities of a crime-thriller, but is dragged by too many irrationalities
","After deeply religious father Jackman's daughter goes missing with a neighbor girl, he targets prime suspect Dano while detective Gyllenhaal pursues other leads. The film doesn't necessarily succeed at being epic, but it is terrifically well-paced for clocking-in at over a two-and-a-half hour runtime—director Villeneuve does an excellent job using fade-outs to skip passed the obvious melodrama. The story involves emotions and chills from all aspects of an unthinkable crime, including: the family members of the abducted children, the investigators and even those close to the suspect. Unfortunately, the movie is dragged by too many obvious detective blunders by Gyllenhaal's characters: 1) Whaaa? I can't discreetly park my car in the middle of the road in broad daylight? 2) Whaaa? I'm going to have all family members take a polygraph, but not consider looking into the fact that one of the fathers owns an abandoned building the girls may be at? 3) Whaaa? When I finally find out one of the fathers owns an abandoned building and I establish my new suspicions of him, I SHOULD call a search team? 4) Whaaa? I've been seeing a lot of mazes ever since I started investigating these girls' disappearances. There IS a connection?Another unfortunate downfall is the annoying and awkward light adjustments between interior and exterior scenes.The moral of a film should either raise questions, or provide answers or some sort of hope. This film just kind of confuses, as it doesn't really grasp hold of how suspects are sometimes guilty until proved innocent or how there are some ridiculous limitations the law has at preventing and/or solving crimes. Either: A) make a statement, or B) give the audience something to reflect on. This film seems to do neither.

","Nolan returns to the helm of what many consider the perfect Batman film. Bale, Caine, Oldman, Freeman, Murphy and McFarlane all reprise their roles spectacularly and flawlessly without upstaging one another nor their performances from 'Begins'. Holmes is replaced with Gyllenhaal, who look nothing alike, but the story itself is too strong to be setback by a recast. Heath Ledger portrays the most chaotic and theatrical -- yet most convincing, memorable and realistic -- Joker to date. The Joker is as amusing as he is intimidating, and will stop at nothing. Ledger's role isn't as pronounced as Nicholson's was in the 1989 film, which is actually a stronger move because it avoids any upstaging. Hans Zimmer's wonderful muddling score just adds to The Joker's prominence. Eckhart makes Harvey Dent his own.

Reservoir Dogs," Unforgettable!!!
","Quentin Tarantino is most famous for his film `Pulp Fiction'. `Pulp Fiction' won over twelve awards. One year before that was Tarantino's second film `True Romance', starring Patricia Arquette & Christian Slater. `True Romance', `Pulp Fiction', `Natural Born Killers', and many other projects written by Tarantino were a spin-off of his first film `Reservoir Dogs'. This film is about a man named Joes Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) who runs a crime business. Cabot is a rich man (thanks to theft) and is wanted by the police. Cobot is a very popular man, and is loved and respected by many of his thief-soldiers. Uncut diamonds are being imported to a store, and Cobot wants his hands on it. He hires six men to do a four-man job. Cobot has everything all planned out (like he always does). He gives his thieves names, so if there's a rat in the house, there will be a less of a chance of getting caught because they don't know your name. Mr. Brown (Tarantino), Mr. White (Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Madsen), Mr. Blue (Bunker), Mr. Orange (Roth), and Mr. Pink (Buscemi) and their given names. They are not to tell anything about themselves to each other, such as their real name, their wife's name, when/where they did time, where they're from, or a bank they robbed. The robbery is all planned out, very well. But something goes wrong! While robbing the store, they are suddenly surrounded by cops. Mr. Pink (Steven Buscemi) has a good feeling that they were set up. Some of the thieves got away, some got killed, and maybe some got caught. The survived thieves meet back at the rendezvous and finally come to the conclusion that; one of the six thieves, Joe Cobot, or his son Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn), is an undercover cop. Throughout the film they try to figure out who the cop is. There is no actual main character. There are three main characters in this film; Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth). Those three are the principle characters in this film. This is a very good film. The first five minutes might be slow for some of you, but it's there so you get to know the characters.

","Loosely based on the Cressida Cowell book series about a teenage boy named Hiccup (Baruche) who aspires to be a dragon slayer just like everyone else admirable in his mythic Viking community. Due to Hiccup's small stature, his goals seem unlikely, until he successfully injures a rare Night Fury (a highly intelligent breed of dragon evolved for speed and stealth) but he instead befriends it, suddenly losing all desire to pursue a career in slaying these misunderstood creatures. One can't help but reminisce on the funny scenes in SUPERBAD, what with common cast and crew members Jonah Hill and Christopher Mintz-Plasse in supporting roles, and Victor Pesavento and Mark Graham in the music department. All-in-all, a magical movie for adults and children alike—a true family flick.

","Eliot Ness (Costner) sets out to take down Al Capone (De Niro), with some of Capone's mobsters verses Ness's hand-picked team The Untouchables (Smith, Garcia and Connery). Historically inaccurate. Costner's voice is emotionless as usual, while Connery's is like he's still playing James Bond; both of their voices are annoying and distracting. De Palma's 'dazzling' direction, ceiling shots for example, are unnecessary; as if De Palma is more concerned about impressing the Academy than telling the story. Smith and Garcia do their job, but nothing fancy. De Niro delivers a surprising unmemorable performance as the notorious Capone. The film itself is overly-theatrical for what it is, what it needs to be and what it should be. But despite all these flaws, none of them are fatal. Fast-paced from beginning to end, every moment enjoyable. From the first line of 'why, since it would seem that you are in effect the Mayor of Chicago, you're not simply being appointed to that position,' to the final line of 'I think I'll have a drink', it's a remarkable and unforgettable film with several great scenes. The chemistry with all The Untouchable is well untouchable.***½ (out of four)",9,0,0,7 April 2010
The Godfather: Part III," A Terribly Misunderstood Film
","Don Michael Corleone (Pacino) seems to have mellowed down in his later years, and he wishes to keep it that way. But just when things start going the way Michael wants, he's pulled back into the life of a mobster. The brilliantly eerie similarities between an old Michael and Brando's elderly Don Vito is what makes this film a must-see. Many fans were disappointed at its tameness and the incestuous subplot. The film does an excellent job of earning its keep by not mimicking the previous two films and moving the story forward as opposed to a full circle. The bias casting of Sophia Coppola is the film's only downfall.***½ (out of four)",9,0,2,24 January 2010
The Matrix Reloaded," Geeky Randy's summary
","2003 sequel lacks all energy that made the 1999 blockbuster a success. The story continues, but does it need to when it's this bad? Even the returning characters are as two dimensional as the new characters. Zion, a home that Morpheus (Fishburne) talked about like it was a place of beauty worth dying for, is disappointingly nothing short of a ghetto. To top that off, when we're introduced to a rundown Zion, we're also given an unnecessary lengthy corny passionate love-scene between Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss. The only thing worth noting in this sci-fi failure is an impressive highway action sequence, as well as the inclusion of eye-candy Monica Bellucci—but even the beauty of Bellucci and the excellent SFX of the highway scene are hardly worth the watch.*½ (out of four)",3,0,0,7 September 2010

","Critically acclaimed zombie comedy about a group of apocalypse survivors trying to find a sanctuary. Starts off very promising, with awkward college student Eisenberg and violently Twinkie craving Harrelson learning new skills from each other while also revealing their tragically humorous histories. Unfortunately, Stone and Breslin come along and—while initially helping add elements and humor to the plot—ultimately ruin all the fun, with Stone becoming a love-interest to Eisenberg, and Breslin offering nothing except lame jokes on adolescent ignorance and obliviousness. Started as a spec script for a TV pilot, and even with its short runtime, the film gets less and less interesting as it progresses. Still, despite the easy jabs at the movie's imperfections, it is without a doubt hilarious and entertaining, and even at some points classic.*** (out of four)",7,0,2,17 March 2015
The Departed," Should be called 'The Retarded'
","American remake of the successful 'Internal Affairs' trilogy, about two men seeking out each other's identity; one is a cop that goes undercover as a mobster, the other, a mobster that goes undercover as a cop. Dream-boats Damon and DiCaprio do a good job vanishing into their roles as tough guys, but their charm and ruthlessness still can't mask the crime-thriller clichés; and the ultra-climatic conclusion is just really nothing more than simply over-the-top. The wittiness of Jack Nicholson doesn't impress since he doesn't seem to do much acting, but rather just charismatically act like Jack. The quirky dialogue of Irish-American mobsters comes off as corny and tiring. Martin Sheen and Mark Wahlberg are memorable and well-delivered in the humorous good-cop-bad-cop odd-couple, with the latter earning a Best Supporting Actor nomination. It was the only nomination that was well-deserve, the only nomination that didn't win and the only nomination that should have won. Won Best Picture, Editing and Adapted Screenplay.

","Ahead of its time for its content, unconventional story structure, false protagonist and the presence of a toilet, Hitchcock's genius direction and Herrmann's chilling score is still gripping as many people today as it did in 1960. Janet Leigh is graciously brilliant in her role as an ordinary woman who is suddenly on the run for making a spur-of-the-moment snatch of $40,000 ($318,875.14 when adjusted for inflation), and Anthony Perkins is without a doubt equally memorable as the underwhelming, well-mannered, codependent manager of the Bates Motel.

Bergen, Lomenda and Piazza are all excellent as well, and Christopher Walken make a fun addition to the cast and let's not forget Joey Russo as Joey Pesci.

Unfortunately, what starts out as a modestly brilliant dialogue-driven script slowly becomes a little more theatrical than necessary, and if the viewer chooses to be a Grinch and dissect the plot, they'll probably find one or two unnecessary stories—after all, a 136 minute rom-com is indeed pushing the limits. Still, the viewing experience is wonderful during the Holiday season, and the movie has great potential to be a Christmas classic.

12 Years a Slave," A film that needed to be made.
","Amazing historical drama about Solomon Northup (Ejiofor), a freeborn African American man kidnapped and sold into slavery. The atrocity of Northup's story within the atrocity of slavery itself makes 12 YEARS A SLAVE a film that needed to be made. Emotionally difficult to endure and excellently acted, with not a single cast member holding the film back in any way. McQueen's trademark of long takes should put this one at the top of the list of any aspiring directors or cinematographers out there; however, there are a handful of shots that linger on close-ups with seemingly no other purpose than to force the characters' feelings on the audience even though it had already been successfully established moments earlier. Although well-acted, the A-listers playing minor roles is a bit unnecessary, not unlike fellow Best Picture Winner THE HURT LOCKER. Still, definitely worthy of Best Picture.

The Wolf of Wall Street," Easily Scorsese's best in almost 20 years!
","Martin Scorsese is a rare director. When it comes to overall filmography-quality, the guy lacks any middle-ground. His praise is either rightly deserved or incredibly overrated. MEANSTREETS, TAXI DRIVER, RAGING BULL, THE KING OF COMEDY, THE LAST TEMPTATION, GOODFELLAS and CASINO, are just a few of his deservedly high-praised features; while GANGS OF NEW YORK, THE DEPARTED and SHUTTER ISLAND are all incredibly overrated. Notice how the rightly praised films are all pre-1996, while all his overrated films are post-1996. So, where, you might ask, does that leave THE WOLF OF WALL STREET? It appears Scorsese has climbed his way out of a slump to create a highly realistic portrayal of Wall Street corruption, with this tale revolving mainly around security-fraud. The memoir of the same name by Jordan Belfort (played by DiCaprio) was a huge inspiration to Ben Younger for his 2000 debut film BOILER ROOM, which is an excellent film in its own right starring late-1990s up-and-comers, but what WOLF delivers that BOILER ROOM lacks is what I'm coining as 'genre gumbo'—and if you do yourself a favor and watch WOLF, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about not to say that you shouldn't do yourself a second favor and also watch BOILER ROOM. Hilarious, cruel and intense; WOLF OF WALL STREET is an epic that is in full-speed from the very first shot, and ceases to slow down until the end credits. Easily Scorsese's best in almost 20 years! However, CASINO has had the privilege of having 19-years to grow on viewers; who knows what WOLF's replay value could be for all we know, it could be the best thing Scorsese has done since RAGING BULL. Only time will tell where it ranks on the Scorsese-classics (definitely higher than lower on the impressively long list); but one thing is for certain, there is no denying it is an immediate classic and possibly the best film of 2013.**** (out of four)",10,2,8,6 April 2014
Scream 2," Wow! This Is The First Time Geeky Randy Meeks Has EVER Been Wrong! Not ALL 'Sequels Suck!'
","Two years after the Woodsboro Murders, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) leaves home to major in acting at Windsor College. Everything is great now.  Her horrible past is behind her.  She has a lead role in a play, is making great friends, and even has a sane boyfriend, Derek (Jerry O'Connell). When everything seems to be going great, two students that attend the same college as Sidney, are brutally murdered by a psychopath in a Father's Death Costume.  Sound familiar?  Yes.  Copycat killer. This copycat killer chooses his/her victims in the order that a victim was killed in Woodsboro.  Similarities of the victims in Woodsboro and Windor are the names.  Maureen Prescott - Maureen Evans.  Steven Orth - Phil Stevens.  You get the picture. The killer wants revenge.  But who is the killer?  And what did Sidney ever do to drive somebody on a killing spree?  If the killer is following Woodsboro, the killer must be from Woodsboro.  But who could it be?Could it be one of Sidney's new friends?  They seem fine, but you never know.  One of them might be from Woodsboro.  Or maybe it's somebody in Woodsboro that she already knows.  A fellow survivor of the Woodsboro Murders?  Dwight `Dewey' Riley (David Arquette), Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), and Geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy).  Why would they want to kill her?  Dewey's sister died trying to help Sidney in the terrifying Woodsboro Muders, maybe Dewey blames Sidney for his sister's death.  Gale, maybe, we all know she's hungry for publicity, maybe killing is the only way to get some.  We all know Randy is in love with Sidney, maybe he thinks he can never get her, so he wants to kill her; Randy and Sidney both go to the same college, doesn't that seem a little strange; they went to the same high school, and now they go to the same college, hundreds of miles away from their hometown, Woodsboro?  Or even Cotton Weary (Liev Scheiber), the innocent man who was sent to death-row because Sidney falsely accused him of murdering her mother three years earlier, and now he want revenge?  The tale is just as terrifying as the original. This film is the best sequel I've ever seen.  It is just a good as the original.  No complaints.  Very scary, very funny, and very original just like `Scream'.  It's even very sad at one part is in the film, which also almost made me cry.  I won't give it away, but it has to do with Ghostface in the newsvan, (you'll know what I'm talking about after you saw this, or if you've already seen it).  You'll be touched by this shocking scene if you're a big fan of the original.  It's also got movie trivia, just like the first.  It's totally a movie for the horror buffs. I gave `Scream' 10/10, I decided it's fair to give `Scream 2' a 10/10, because it was just as good.  If you loved `Scream', I suggest you see this one too.

Bram Stoker's Dracula," Damn, This Movie Didn't Have To Be As Long As Dracula's Life
","This movie is unnecessarily long.  No, it's not a three hour film, but it didn't have to be as long as it was.  It just kept going on and on.  At least `Nosferatu (1922)' made it's point and was done.  This film had every little detail, and kept going on.Gary Oldman was a terrible Dracula.  They could've at least made him look like Count Orlock rather than a stylish character.  Or, if they wanted a stylistic character, than they could've casted a better actor, that wasn't so ugly.  Maybe more of a nice face.  It just seemed too weird that a guy as ugly as Gary Oldman, could get with a hot woman like Winona Ryder.  But it wasn't just his looks, he was too old also.  If you want to see a good Dracula movie, see Nosferatu.On the upside, the casting and acting was great; besides Gary Oldman.  It really respected it's story, and made it one of a kind.  Although I had a lot of disappointments, I still think this film deserves a 7/10.  I am being very harsh on this movie, since it's a remake, but I suggest you go out and rent it and judge it for yourself.  Trust me, it is certainly not a waste of money.  This is a movie that'll give one another various opinions.  Watch it.7/10",6,1,2,17 June 2001

Scream," What More Could A Horror-Buff Ask For?
","What more could a horror-buff ask for?  `Scream' has it all.  Movie trivia, movie spoofs, twisted ending, twisted beginning, talented actors/actresses, a great motive, lovable characters, and even scary the second time you see it. `Scream' is about a young girl named Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is trying to put her life back together after the brutal murder of her loving mother, a year earlier.  The accused murderer, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), is locked up and is waiting for an appeal to be put to death by the gas chamber. Out of the blue, these mysterious killings start to happen.  The nosey, local news reporter, Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), is scooping out this mystery of why these killings are starting.  Weathers believes that Weary is innocent of the murder of Sidney's mother.  Sidney disagrees.  But Gale Weathers isn't too far from proving Sidney wrong. So, is the real murderer getting nervous, about getting caught for the murder of Sidney's mother, and the framing of poor Cotton Weary?  Is the murderer going to try and frame somebody else for the murder of Sidney's mother after Weary is proven innocent, like.Sidney, or even Sidney's father? Is that why there is a killing spree?  Sure, why else would the murder want to reveal Weary's innocence?  If the murderer doesn't do something soon, (s)he'll be caught.  So (s)he wants to throw Weathers off track. Though we wonder what the killer with do next, we also wonder.who is the killer?  Could it be Sidney's boyfriend, Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich)? Sidney's best friend, Tatum Riley (Rose McGowan)?  Tatum's brother, the town's deputy, Deputy Dwight `Dewey' Riley (David Arquette)?  Tatum's boyfriend, Stuart (Matthew Lillard).  Sidney's secret admirer, the town's mastermind, who knows everything about everything, Geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy)?  Or even Gale Weathers herself?  (Gale is money hungry, and seeking for fame, maybe she could use a little publicity, you never know.)  But I tell you, the killer is great and surprising, with a fantastic motive. I did not see any problem with this movie, except for a couple bloopers (which no movie doesn't have), so I give it a 10/10.

Prometheus," Geeky Randy's summary
","Scott directs this implicit prequel to his terrifying 1979 sci-fi noir classic ALIEN about a crew's exploration on a distant planet that might have the answers to the origin of mankind and the meaning of life. Great subtle nods to the other films in the franchise, especially ALIEN; however, the touches of horror turn into sci-fi/action nonsense by film's end, with very little (if any) neo-noir elements that made ALIEN such a fantastic film. Admirable that CGI was used as little as possible outside of establishing-shots and Streitenfeld's score is one of the best that the industry has offered in the last few years. PROMETHEUS is nicely packed with ambiguity and symbolism to keep itself fresh even after multiple viewings; however, when a film has this incredibly graceful method of storytelling, why make the protagonist someone seeking answers instead of asking questions? It's a contradiction of how the audience is intended to feel and therefore distances us from our main character. Star Rapace looks weak and plays the main character equally timid to her physical appearance, with no emotional strength whatsoever; and Marshall-Green's casting as her partner and love-interest is so mismatched and unnecessary. Did they really need 45-year-old Pearce to play a 103-year-old man? UGH! There are plenty of talented elderly actors who could have handled this simple role. At least Elba, Fassbender and Theron are pleasant and portray interesting characters to make up for the terrible casting of Marshall-Green, Pearce and Rapace.

The Dark Knight Rises," A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.
","After eight years in seclusion, Batman resurfaces to face Bane, a mastermind bent on destroying Gotham and has ties to Bruce Wayne's past. Christopher Nolan's conclusion to his Dark Knight trilogy should be treated as a wrap up rather than a third installment. Despite many new characters being introduced, even their conflicts and motives are derived from events that occurred in the previous two films. Such an approach could be seen as a weakness, since the conflict could just end up being sort of a rematch rather than moving the story forward; however, Nolan's approach works terrificly. Over an hour is shot in stunning IMAX, but the film is more touching than it is intense and that's its best quality. Hardy steps in as the genius mercenary Bane, who is slightly bigger, slightly stronger and slightly smarter than Batman, thus making him a challenge best suited for the grand finale. The Joker works best as Batman's arch-nemesis since they are polar opposites, with The Joker standing for everything Batman stands against. Two-Face works best as Batman's most tragic enemy because Harvey Dent is very much like Bruce Wayne the only difference is: Dent copes with his tragedy through revenge rather than seeking justice as Wayne did. Bane works best as Batman's most challenging villain because of his physical and mental superiority—forget the Bane you saw in 'BATMAN & ROBIN'. Nolan carefully chose all his villains in the series wisely and executed them perfectly. Hardy had big shoes to fill following Ledger's posthumous Oscar winning performance; while Bane is no Joker, Hardy does a satisfying job and should not be compared to Ledger's performance as they are completely different roles. It is Michael Caine, however, that delivers the most memorable and touching performance of the entire film. A wonderful conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.**** (out of four)",10,141,172,1 January 2013
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," Martha!
","Picking up 18 months after the disastrous events of the disaster of a film MAN OF STEEL, Batman (Affleck) fears future collateral damage from Superman (Cavill), and sets out to stop him. Disappointing for the Superman fans, since this outing focuses more on Batman (with Affleck given top billing); and disappointing for the Batman fans for the lost opportunity of THE DARK KNIGHT RETURNS. There are some noteworthy ideas, but they're few and far between; for example, Batman's voice-changer is an excellent addition that would've saved Christian Bale some throat scratching. But never once is the viewer rooting for or against anyone; what with this gumbo of several important characters all being crammed into one film leaves everyone underdeveloped and the audience apathetic—there is no beat for us to cheer for the introduction of Batman or his batmobile, nor the reintroduction of Superman or Lois Lane. Aside from flashbacks of Bruce Wayne's childhood (which is only necessary because the history was rewritten for the sake of a cheep plot device), there is very little development or interaction from our stars (besides fighting) and it is all just go, go, go, CGI mess everywhere for almost two-and-a-half hours.

The intersection of the two plots can only lead to one conclusion, unless you fail to realize that there's a reason these two stories are within the same film. Despite all the failed surprises and twists, the plot at least delivers the payoff the story has built up; and you'll find satisfaction in the film if you can shrug off the countless flaws with the realization that it never really hinders the progression.

Dennis Hopper is excellent (as always) as the bitter nine-fingered bad guy who is bent on getting compensation for his service as an officer that left him jobless and thumbless, and only rewarded with 'a cheap gold watch'.

An all-in-all fun film that never slows down (it can't!) and is easy to follow—though no one will seek it out for its depth; even the supporting cast recognizes that Reeves' character lacks any sort of wisdom, with the villain even threatening: 'Do not attempt to grow a brain'.

Frodo (Wood) continues the trek to Mount Doom along with Sam (Astin) and Gollum (Serkis), while the remaining fellowship take on new tasks—particularly Gandolf (McKellen) and Pippin (Boyd), who journey to Minas Tirith to seek aid from steward Denethor (Noble), the stern but grieving father of Boromir (Bean) and Faramir (Wenham). Took away 11 Oscars including Best Picture though neglect of the previous two films may have played a part in this. Hill and Otto actually become likable in this installment after some much needed character development, but the corny dialogue that first appeared in TWO TOWERS doesn't lessen.***½ (out of four)",9,1,2,3 December 2014
Pitch Perfect," Geeky Randy's summary
","The Barden Bellas, a female a-cappella group, add University freshman Kendrick to the club, but she brings with her a creative freedom demand that is much needed but might tear them all apart; however, they'll have to agree on something if they hope to stand a chance against their male rivals in a campus competition. The ensemble cast delivers excellently in both acting and singing, and the musical choices are quite sound (pun?). Worthy date-night movie, but all the laughs are targeted to the female viewer. The hypocrisy of Kendrick ranting about how predictable movies are is quite a turn off, considering how textbook the unfolding of this story is. Loosely adapted from the non-fiction PITCH PERFECT: THE QUEST FOR COLLEGIATE A CAPPELLA GLORY by Mickey Rapkin.**½ (out of four)",6,0,0,8 February 2015
A Nightmare on Elm Street," Geeky Randy's summary
","A group of teens are haunted by Freddy Kruger (Englund), a burn victim with knives for fingers who murders his prey in their dreams. Not only scary for its violence and Englund's performance, but director Craven does a terrific job toying with the audience's perception between imagination and reality. However, the film is plagued by terrible dialogue, and Oscar-nominee Blakley's delivery is horrendous. Depp is surprisingly forgetful in his debut. Despite its overwhelming flaws, it's still worth a replay every five or so years. Seems kind of like a cheap-shot to villain-ize a burn victim, but Kruger's attire and his boiler room lair are just so perfect for the horror genre.★★½ (out of four)",5,1,4,18 October 2015
The Matrix," Geeky Randy's summary
","The Wachowski brothers deliver a tasty sci-fi thriller that everyone from bully to nerd can't resist. Reeves, who makes his one dimensional acting work here, plays a computer hacker who is believed to be the coming savior of a futuristic simulated reality controlled by artificial intelligence—Hugo Weaving almost steals the film as one of these sentient machines. Chong, Fishburne, Moss and Pantoliano all do an excellent job as the supporting cast of this classic joyride. However, the remainder of the rebellion is extremely underdeveloped, but the pros of the film are so great that they overshadow such a flaw.***½ (out of four)",9,0,2,17 August 2010
Heat," Geeky Randy's summary
","Pretentious bank heist 'epic' about a team of detectives led by over-the-top loud-mouthed Pacino on the trail of tight-knit group of robbers led by a-little-too-reserved De Niro. The film dates poorly; specifically, with Pacino screaming out supposedly clever lines that were probably witty for 1995, but nowadays is just seen as a cheap cry for attention. But even for 1995 standards, the film is incredibly overrated, what with your typical over-sappy and unnecessary Michael Mann unsexy love scene, or the ridiculous time spent (or wasted) developing overly-complex characters only to give them a rushed send-off. The tech aspect and the amazing band heist sequence (one of cinema's best) are both worth a look, but other than that, you're wasting your time.** (out of four)",6,4,8,31 March 2014
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Geeky Randy's summary
","George Lucas' groundbreaking saga starts here, a epic space opera about rebels trying to save Princess Leia (Fisher) from the tyrannical Darth Vader (Jones/Prowse). Fun story with many of film history's most beloved characters; not to mention the impressiveness of its success and inspiration. However, the story-arc seems so light-weight knowing what follows in sequels 'Empire' and 'Jedi', and the absence of Yoda, Palpatine, Admiral Piette and Lando Calrissian certainly make you realize how dull this film is in comparison to the following two when you re-watch it. The most interesting conflicts of the series happens in the sequels, making 'Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope' the least intense and impressive of the original trilogy.**½ (out of four)",7,1,2,12 September 2010
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Easily one of the greatest sci-fi films of all-time, as well as one of the greatest sequels of all-time.
","Sequel to the 1977 smash hit follows Luke Skywalker (Hamill) training to be a Jedi from the lovable new character Yoda (Oz), while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones), who himself has a life-changing secret. More epic and easily one-ups 'A New Hope', not just with effects and designs, but also story; with all the characters becoming much more three dimensional, plus the introduction of numerous new character that add spice to the overall series. Easily one of the greatest sci-fi films of all-time, as well as one of the greatest sequels of all-time.**** (out of four)",10,0,1,16 September 2010
Aladdin," Geeky Randy's summary
","Extraordinary Disney retelling of THE ARABIAN NIGHTS tale about an impoverished young ne'er-do-well who is recruited and then double-crossed by a sorcerer, only to find himself in possession of a wonderful oil lamp that houses a genie who will grant him three wishes. The addition of extra characters and razzle-dazzle make the journey even more worthwhile, adding a charm to this old story without diluting what made it a classic in the first place. Much excitement despite being lighthearted. The voice actors fit their animated characters perfectly, with Robin Williams easily stealing the show with his grand performance as the Genie. Composer Alan Menken and songwriters Howard Ashman and Tim Rice created one of film's greatest soundtracks. Exceptional animation as well.**** (out of four)",10,1,1,25 August 2014
Sin City," Geeky Randy's summary
","Anthology film based on Frank Miller's graphic novels of the same name. A comic book brought to life, and if you take it at face-value and leave logic at the door, you'll enjoy the incredible ride. Intense, hilarious, sexy, disgusting; all the ingredients of an unforgettable guy-flick. Mickey Rourke is a genius as his portrayal as Marv, and Elijah Wood is haunting as Kevin even though he doesn't utter a word—'The Hard Goodbye' is definitely the superior segment, though the others are worth a look too. Film-noir fans will appreciate the film's atmosphere.***½ (out of four)",9,2,3,18 November 2014
Her," A weird love-story of a weird man. Only distances the audience further from the reality the film tries to build.
","In near-future L.A., Theodore Twombly (Joaquin Phoenix) starts a relationship with Samantha (Scarlett Johansson), who is smart, funny, adventurous and a computer. Has its moments, but is an overall pretentious outing despite some of its good points on love and emotions in a world that has an ever-growing connection to technology. The overall downfall is Phoenix as a very awkward man in a very unusual relationship—this may have been the intention in order to establish the believability of someone who would fall in love with an operating system, but it ultimately distances the audience even further from the reality that it attempts to build. Worthy soundtrack though.**½ (out of four)",6,0,0,16 January 2015
Mad Max: Fury Road," Ultimately a fun nightmarish ride worth time and money, despite its obvious flaws.
","One long battle of car chases and explosions set in a futuristic outback. Gasoline and water are apparently very valuable, but we see no character treating them like scarce commodities. There's not a whole lot of dialogue to establish what's going through the minds of these underdeveloped characters in a fictional world, but here goes a shot: At some point during a scuffle within a scuffle, Hardy and Theron team up to help the five wives of cult leader Keays-Byrne flee his wretched wasteland (no, they don't bother with trying to save any of the children or old people we saw for some reason, just five beautiful women). However, it is commendable for using CGI sparingly. Director Miller intended to make the film feel like one continuous chase, and his accomplishment is at the price of establishing interesting characters; not to mention that it's impractical for the audience to be pumped the entire time—a roller-coaster has to go up and down. The flame-shooting guitarist was undeniably savage though. There ends up being too many unintentional callbacks to Hardy's performance in THE DARK KNIGHT RISES: a mask covering the nose and mouth, blood transfusion tubing, the weakness of hope, use of a sawed-off shotgun, etc. Ultimately a fun nightmarish ride worth time and money, despite its obvious flaws.** (out of four)",6,2,7,26 May 2015
The Wedding Singer," Geeky Randy's summary
","After being ditched at the alter, wedding singer (and aspiring rockstar) Sandler decides to give up love for good and live life as a bachelor, until he falls for coworker Barrymore and ends up helping her plan her wedding to womanizing Glave. The soundtrack is amongst some of the better 1980s playlists out there, and even if you don't care about a retro flashback, this outing is still a charming romantic-comedy. Some of the laughs are more side-jokes than plot related, and Sandler has a few moments of his annoying trademark tirade, but why pry too much when it has the fun, romance and ability to be replayed no different than your favorite '80s record? ★★★½ (out of four)",9,1,1,16 October 2015
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," The peak of the series!
","Indiana Jones is back for a third round, battling the Nazis again while tracking down his father (Connery) who suddenly went missing while searching for the Holy Grail. Ford, Elliot and Rhys-Davies all reprise their roles from 'Raiders', but this time their performances seem to have better chemistry with each other. Sean Connery nearly steals the show as the arrogant and gruff Professor Henry Jones, Sr. Doody makes a better love interest and has more to do with the story than just the token girl that Allen and Capshaw unfortunately got stuck with. From the opening scene with Phoenix portraying a young Indiana Jones, to the climax at the Canyon of the Crescent Moon, this is easily marked as the peak of the series. Absolutely stunning.**** (out of four)",10,2,3,17 August 2010
Goodfellas," Geeky Randy's summary
","Classic gangster flick adapted from co-screenwriter Nicholas Pileggi's 1987 non-fiction book WISEGUY about Henry Hill (Ray Liotta) and his friends working their way up through the Lucchese crime family, and the benefits and consequences that await them. After all these years, it's still all around excellent. Truthfully, it breaks the show-don't-tell rule several times, what with iconic scenes and a flawless soundtrack getting drowned out by voice-over way too frequently; but, hey, if someone were to ever reinvent the wheel, it's only right that it'd be Scorsese.***½ (out of four)",9,0,0,15 May 2015
Cinderella Man," Geeky Randy's summary
","An overall entertaining film about American boxer James J. Braddock, world heavyweight champion from 1935–37. A little melodramatic at times with interchangeable acting to go along, but ultimately a really good outing. Gordon Sim's set decoration and Daniel Orlandi's costume design fit the Great Depression-era tone perfectly, and Ron Howard's directing of the fight scenes create a wickedly superb realism that makes the audience feel like they're the ones giving and taking the punches. Neighbor DeWitt is the granddaughter of the real Braddock. Craig Bierko is incredibly interesting as challenger Max Baer, though Baer is portrayed as a harsher person than he was in real life.***½ (out of four)",9,0,0,11 July 2014
Beetlejuice," Geeky Randy's summary
","1980s Burton/Keaton combo you can't go wrong! Deals with a family haunted by a recently deceased young couple (Baldwin and Davis)—yes, it certainly sounds like a cliché horror movie, but the talented cast and the memorable scenes make it anything but, especially with Keaton in the titular role as an obnoxious ghost trying to permanently scare away the new inhabitants. As with many Burton films, the movie relies heavily on visuals (that were impressive for its time, but are now a tad dated), leaving the audience with a fun ride that is worth revisiting once every few years, but lacks any iconic characters or dialogue worth reciting.**½ (out of four)",7,0,0,27 October 2014
The Simpsons Movie," An 87 minute episode.
","Feature-length adventure of the greatest animated family ever. Homer pollutes Lake Springfield, causing the EPA to enclose Springfield in a large glass dome. When Homer and his family escape through a sinkhole and aren't wanted back by the residence, the Simpsons head north to start anew in Alaska. Higher quality than the majority of what the show offered after 2001, but still nothing close to the first 10 or even 12 seasons. Offers an interesting plot and plenty of worthy laughs, but one can't help but gripe when the movie is really nothing more than an inflated episode on an inflated screen. Still, like the show itself, it is funny and has replay value.*** (out of four)",8,3,4,15 May 2015
The Wizard of Oz," The wonderful 'Wizard of Oz'.
","29-years after the first adaptation of L. Frank Baum's classic novel, Victor Fleming's version came along with the colorful (literally) Oz that will forever touch anybody who watches the film. One of the greatest soundtracks of all-time. Supposedly, Pink Floyd's 'The Dark Side of the Moon', one of rock's greatest albums of all-time, will synchronize with the film. Judge for yourself — the experience (plus an excuse to watch 'The Wizard of Oz' again and listen to 'The Dark Side of the Moon' again) is worth it even if it fails. Buddy Ebsen had to back out as the Tin Woodman due to an allergy from the makeup. Followed by 'Journey Back to Oz' and 'Return to Oz'.**** (out of four)",10,3,4,27 January 2010
Law Abiding Citizen," An intriguing concept that ends up lacking purpose.
","After watching his family die at the hands of two senseless criminals, Clyde Shelton (Butler) decides to take justice into his own hands when one of the two criminals walks free due to a bungled investigation. Not only does Shelton target the killer, but also others heavily involved in the broken justice system, particularly DA Nick Rice (Foxx) who gave the freed killer a plea bargain. Clever concept and full of quirky dialogue. But it begins to slide down more and more into unrealistic circumstances; as if it wasn't on the verge of being far-fetched in the first place. The movie leaves you in the center of the characters' motives. Not once does the film attempt to make a stand for anything. The entire movie has a 'decide for yourself' logic, pretty much making the existence of the film lack any purpose. The two leads were great; along with a strong supporting cast, especially Colm Meaney as a somewhat comedic relief.** (out of four)",5,9,17,28 March 2010
The Godfather," Geeky Randy's summary
","Brando and Pacino share the lead in this masterpiece based on screenwriter Puzo's best-selling novel of the same name, about the boss of an organized crime family gradually transferring control of his business to his son, a war hero who never had any interest in following in his father's footsteps. Pacino's transformation from a black-sheep to a ruthless Mafia boss is so slick that it's worth every second of the film's epic length, while Brando's iconic delivery as the legendary Don Vito Corleone is literally untouchable and indisputably one of cinema's greatest performances. Definitely a film that might need one or two replays before being fully appreciated, but it is a classic for all the right reasons. Followed by a must-see second installment two years later, which is arguable even better than this perfect picture! Direct Coppola co-wrote the script.**** (out of four)",10,2,5,17 March 2015
