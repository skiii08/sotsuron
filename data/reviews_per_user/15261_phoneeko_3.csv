The Avengers," This rating system needs to go to 11
","BB / TDK not withstanding, (to me those 2 are drama/action/thrillers that happen to include a guy with a costume)'The Avengers' is the best super hero movie ever. ...or in other words: This is the best superhero movie ever. And that's because it is the best superhero movie EVER. Script:9, DP:9, Sets:9, Directing:10, Acting:8, Editing:10, FX:10, Score:9, Sound Design:8, Fun:1000. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. There are so many levels of ass-kicking in this movie i cannot begin to describe them. I think i barely blinked for the first act of the movie, stopped breathing altogether during the second act only to have my eyeballs drop and my ears explode for the third act, which made me go AAAAWWWW EEEEHHH OOHHHHH UUUUU and loads of AHAHHAAAHHHAA. At one point i was actually using my t-shirt to wipe teardrops off my face i was laughing so hard. I actually cannot remember the last time i had so much fun at the movies. If you are a comics / superhero or even just a general movie fan, this one is a must-see. Joss Weadon just made himself the uber-god of geek Olympus. Now somebody please give him a billion dollars and let him work his magic on the next 2 installments.",9,1,3,28 April 2012
Oblivion," Beautifully shot, never boring, but...
","Excellent cinematography, if maybe a bit too much on the 'euro' style (instead of the over saturated colors we see lately). Story is good, but it tries too hard to present you with shocks and twists that can either be seen a mile away or are not significant enough to bring anything interesting to the movie as a whole. Tom cruise is solid as usual, and the rest of the cast supports him accordingly, althou talents like Morgan Freeman and Nicolas Koster Waldau are largely underwritten and underused. Sadly the script sometimes seems borrowed, and as a result the movie reminds you of so many other science fiction movies that it looses its own identity to an otherwise decent reimagining of a 'post- disaster' future earth. I did enjoy the movie, it is by no means a waste of your time and/or money, it only leaves that idea in your mind that by tweaking it a little more, or maybe even by shortening it and pacing it a little bit faster, a much stronger movie could have emerged. Anyhow, i'm hoping to see Joseph Kocinsky's next directorial effort as soon as possible (TR30N?), I'm becoming a fan pretty fast.",7,3,4,1 May 2013
Knowing," Entertaining, interesting and nicely shot.
","I know, I know.. it rips stuff from every major sci-fi sub-genre i can think of... but hey, if only all the sci-fi we get to see was this good! Proyas proves (again) to be a very capable director, Nic Cage is OK (but not as good as we all know he can be if he wants to), rest of the cast is more then adequate. I liked the story, good mix of weirdness and believability, some plot inconsistencies here and there, some development missing on some issues but mostly OK and also not 'stupid'. It does not require the usual 'suspension of disbelief' that most sci-fi movies seem to need today. FX are on par with bigger budgeted movies and sound was really good. In the end all i can say is i had a good 2 hours of fun watching an entertaining movie, ...isn't that what these movies are made for? A solid 7+ is my vote.",7,1,3,25 June 2009
