Blade Runner 2049," The Ghost was in that Shell - SPOILERS
","If you've been wondering what happened the Ghost of the live action adaptation of 1995 anime Ghost in the Shell, you can stop looking. Apparently, he decided to occupy this carapace instead.If you were a fan of the 1995 anime and were disappointed by the 2017 film you might find some solace here, if not you probably have no idea what I'm on about. I didn't feel like Blade Runner 2049 delved into the fundamental questions of what makes us human, what does it mean to be alive, 'does this unit have a soul?' nearly as deep as 1995 Ghost in the Shell did but the ideas are there.Okay, I'm done talking about another film. I loved Blade Runner 2049. I have seen the original Blader Runner twice but not in the last 12 years at best. Thus, my recollection of that story is more than hazy. That also means that I didn't really appreciate it as a follow up to a previous work but as a story on its own and my expectations were not that high, I just wanted to have a good time. The film felt beautiful to me, in many aspects. I loved the score, the visuals and the characters towards whom I felt really invested in (for the main ones at least). Ryan Gosling is excellent but the lack of expression of his character does take a bit of value away in my opinion. There's one particular scene when he realises that his false memories are actually his own true memories (or so he thinks) that felt quite powerful to me, a brief but intense moment. I would have enjoyed to see more intensity, rage or anger from this character. Any display of strong emotions would have been fine but in that case, I think that more fury/passion would have made this character even more relatable and impactful, to me at least. Now, the performance that really got me came from an actress I didn't know before, Sylvia Hoeks playing Luv. What a performance, she steals the show as far as I'm concerned and it was thrilling to watch her character unfold. I loved Harrison's Ford performance and what Jared Leto brings to his archetypal but great rendition of a man that basically believes himself to be a God. I was also impressed by Dave Bautista's acting, even if he only makes a small appearance, and all the other actors were on point.Before going to the theatre, I was genuinely concerned that 2h45 was going to be too long. I remember seeing 1H30 flicks that felt too long so imagine my surprise when I realised the film was about to end after what felt like 1H45. This is quite a feat considering the fact that most of the film unfolds leisurely, is full of lengthy slow scenes and not a whole lot of action.Another thing that's noteworthy is that to me, it felt like the story addresses a lot of questions but in a more subtle way than I'm typically used to. Meaning it does not slap you in the face with its ideas and questioning but rather suggest a lot of things, leaving you free to make you own opinions or even to pick up on them. I'm pretty sure that I'll pick up on things I missed when I watch it a second time.Nevertheless, part of the story lacks coherence as well as plausibility. For coherence, I don't remember the original film much, but you're never really explained how Replicants work, what makes the new generation obedient, how does it all work, what are the rules embedded in a replicant, how and why can he bypass them, how does it all work really. How does society accepts that a humanoid sensitive being should be considered a slave/property? I'm gonna stop there but I feel like there's a lot of information that's just missing about this world they're living in or questions I kept asking myself in vain because the story doesn't deal with them at all. I'm aware that it would have needed a lot more time to do so but the lack of information bring about of lack of coherence in my eyes. Then, about plausibility, here's what disturbed me. Luv is able to infiltrate a police station, steal evidence, kill a forensic, kill a chief inspector with apparently no consequences or any investigation following up on that. I get that the pregnancy of a replicant is taboo, that they want to keep it secret and I get that considering her 'owner', Luv should indeed have significant resources that would allow her to steal evidence and assassinate a high ranking officer. Problem is, the way it's handled in the film makes it look like she can just walk in wherever she wants, kill whomever she wants, that there is almost virtually no system in place to prevent it and that once it's done, life just continues as if nothing happened. It's a mistake in my opinion but it didn't take much away from my experience.I also felt like the way the film ended left many, many things hanging: the revolution to come, Wallas's fate, the Colonies and Blade Runner vast Universe in general but it turns out that though the director is opened to the idea of a follow up, it's not something he has thought about at all... I don't really get it but hey, that's just how it is.To sum it up, stunning visuals, captivating atmosphere, great acting, strong emotional impact, few but intense and significant action sequences: a great cinematographic experience for me. Final verdict: 9,3/10. This rating isn't an attempt to evaluate the actual objective value of the film but merely reflects my own enjoyment of the work.",9,2,11,6 October 2017
Wind River," Wind River - SPOILERS
","One of my favourite movie of the year so far, not that I've watched that many to be honest but still.Wind river is a dark, gritty and at times contemplative polar that does not refrain to show violence and brutality to tell its story. The violence didn't feel gratuitous though, on the contrary, it served the story, the character and plot development.I really enjoyed the performance of Jeremy Renner but the character is not an expressive one, meaning that except for maybe two or three moments, it doesn't really let the actor shine in my opinion. I also loved the performance of Elizabeth Olsen, especially since contrary to him, her characters displays a good range of emotions and she nails it. More importantly, and I'm not really sure why, but I felt that the relationship between the two characters worked really well. It is kinda surprising because they do not share that many things or have a lot of deep emotional moments but you can definitely tell that there truly is a bound that slowly grows between them. I think it may simply comes from the fact that they 'see' each other and they come to have a deep respect from one another as two decent human beings that wanna solve a dreadful case. The overall atmosphere of the film felt great to me even though I'd say that it's still very dark at times. The scene where you see before you what really happened that night was not easy to watch, especially since you more or less know what's gonna happen. The fact they all die in the end doesn't take away from how despicable and vile what they did so I didn't even feel good about the resolution.And that's where my main and only issue with this movie comes from. I see the unfolding of the events that transpired as not very coherent or at least I would have needed the writers to tell me a bit more about those guys and how things got so far and dark so fast. You can obviously see that the overly drunk guy is mean, up to no good and his buddies don't look too clever either. But that doesn't fully explain how they suddenly decide to beat their coworker and probably buddy to death, rape the girl and go back to work the next day. The second big issue is how they handle what happened. So, they beat their coworker to death, leave a girl to die somewhere in the snow, act like nothing ever happened, wait for a police team to come knock on the door, ambush them and kill them all... Like, REALLY ? I get that they're not the smartest bunch but even if they'd manage to survive, kill all the police team, one FBI agent of whom they are absolutely aware of the rank, what next ??? That part doesn't make sense to me.What would have made more sense in my eyes is if they had accidentally killed or hurt very badly their coworker during a stupid fight, decided to hide it by killing them both and be the absolute vile human beings that they are by raping the girl. For the shootout, I think the whole scene should have been scratched and the writers could have found some other way for the law enforcement to go after them because as it is, it really looks like these guys think they'd be able to get away with the death of 1 civilian, 1 coworker, a bunch of police officers and one fbi agent which is delusional.Anyway, it doesn't take that much away from my overall enjoyment of the film because it is very solid and many other aspects.Final verdict: 8/10. This rating is not an attempt to evaluate the actual value of the film but merely reflects my own appreciation of it.",8,1,4,20 September 2017
Dunkirk," Dunkirk - NO Spoilers
","I'm sure everything I'm about to say has been said before over and over but I'll say it anyway. I did spent a quite good moment during the film overall. The film is visually stunning. The intense music and sound effects create a singular atmosphere that felt quite captivating at times. The acting is on point, my favourite performance comes from Cillian Murphy but we don't see that much of him. So yeah, the movie is technically superb, I could really feel the tension at several points but not as much as one would expect. At times, I was even laid back and simply enjoying the action but it felt like the music insisted on trying to make me feel tense, nervous, trying to keep me on my toes, like it was telling me 'watch out! watch out! be wary! this is a stressful situation!' and I was like 'give me a break man, I'm not tense right now ( yes, I call my musics 'man' when I speak to them regardless of their gender) .The lack of dialogue, character background and the constant invisible threat (ennemies are virtually invisible most of the time and you never see their faces) didn't work for me. I understand why the director made this choices, or at least I think I do but the end, it doesn't matter. Question is if I liked it or not. The lack of emotional involvement towards the different characters made me unable to truly relate, care and thus fully enjoy the movie and story. It also took away some of the tension as I can't get really stressed out for a character if i don't care about him.Overall, it was a good experience but it's not what I'm looking for in a movie.Final verdict: 7/10. This rating isn't an attempt to evaluate the actual objective value of the film but merely reflects my appreciation of it.",7,1,6,19 September 2017
