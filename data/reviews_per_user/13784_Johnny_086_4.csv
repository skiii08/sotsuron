Resident Evil: Afterlife," The best of the Resident Evil Saga
","I've seen all Resident Evil movies but not because I'm a RE fan, it's more because I'm a Milla Jovovich fan. I loved the previous ones especially the first one but I think this one is the greatest and show us what is coming next is going to be awesome. Milla is again Alice and she's the best of this film, I fall in love with bad-ass girls and she's the perfect one. The second thing great about this film is the great and awesome action sequences in 3D which is, in my opinion, better than Avatar and any other 3D movie. It's true that the movie doesn't have the greatest plot but it's quite good for what the movie is. Maybe some people will not like the many slow-motion action scenes 'Matrix-Style', but it shows you the beauty of the 3D can do in a great action movie. 8/10 = The best from the saga, and wait for the next one, I'm sure it will be even better than this one!",8,8,18,12 September 2010
Frozen," Best Disney film ever!
","Disney's magic is back after 20 years, this film is by far (without counting the Pixar ones) the greatest one they have released, I never had so many different emotions while watching a film, it will make you laugh and cry multiple times.Mild Spoilers! - The main plot centers about Elsa, a princess going to be queen who has the power to control and create ice and snow but after an accident in which almost kills her young sister, Anna, she has to stop making magic and no one can ever see her doing that stuff. Everything goes bad for Elsa, as she has stronger powers everyday but her parents forgive her to use them and try everything to control them until all gets even worse when the king and queen die from an accident, she becomes alone with no one knowing her secret until the coronation day where she gets angry about her sister and uses her powers accidentally. She goes far away from the city unknowing she started a never ending winter. Her sister, Anna, will go to find her and try to convince her to use the powers to stop it and everything become normal again but that won't be easy.The story is very interesting as it has many different kind of scenes from action to comedy passing to drama and musical. Yes, there are lot of songs and good ones specially 'For the first time since forever' and the great 'Let it go' which will win for sure an Academy Award next year. If you loved the old Disney films like Beauty and the Beast, the Lion King and Little Mermaid, you are going to love this one too. While this movie is based on 'The Snow Queen' (I actually preferred that title over Frozen) it doesn't share anything from the old tale except the main character, Elsa, but nothing else. The animation is very well done, the best one even from Pixar films, I really hope it wins a couple of Oscars as it deserves it!The characters are very different from each other, we have the funny one, Olaf the little snowman making funny jokes all the time, Kristoff and his reindeer are the heroes who help Anna to find her sister and Anna herself who remember a bit to Rapunzel from 'Tangled', she's a funny and foolish character that all children will like. And then there's Elsa who's the best from all of them, it's a dimensional character with feelings that you will feel sorry for her and feel her pain...I actually felt connected with her (for personal reasons that I'm not including here, he-he) but she's the main reason why I loved this film!路 The good things of this film is the main character Elsa (I felt in love with her in an instant) and the entire casting, the songs are well made for the first time since a long, long time. I was actually afraid they'd include too much comedy (like they did in Tangled) but it was good they didn't. The story is entertaining and the ending is sad but beautiful!路 The bad things are the other main character, Anna, who has too much screen time, don't get me wrong, she was good but I'd liked to see more of Elsa who is, in all means, a more interesting character. Another thing I didn't like was those small creatures that looked like rocks and ogres, they weren't funny neither important for the movie.RATING: 9.4",10,3,11,19 December 2013
X-Men: First Class," Best X-Men film ever made
","I always have been a huge fan of the X-Men franchise, mostly because of the main characters and feeling connected to Magneto and his feelings towards humanity, but after watching this new film, my opinion about the old X-Men films have changed. First Class tells the story of how Magneto and Professor X met, how they became enemies, how Magneto found his helmet and how Charles ended on a wheelchair. Watching this feels great but the adds of new characters and new stories is even better. You can't compare this to the old movies just because this one is too much better, you forget about Storm, Jean Grey and the others while watching this amazing and well explained story. Magneto is the star of this film and his amazing power and dramatic past, Charles Xavier is better than ever, the bad guy is Sebastian Shaw, a extremely powerful mutant made by an amazing Kevin Bacon doing what he does best...and if I have to choose a secondary character I have to name January Jones as Emma Frost, she's amazing and as cold as the Ice Queen. I really hope they make a new trilogy because once you end watching it, you just want more!THE BEST: The ending is awesome, all characters especially Magneto, Professor X, Sebastian Shaw and Emma Frost.THE WORST: Kinda disappointed in Mystique, she was better when she was more mysterious...RATING: 9/10 !",9,0,2,4 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," This is why I love going to the cinema!
","There's good cinema, bad cinema and awesome cinema....for this film a new word has to be created as it surpasses the other awesome films that have been this year... This film takes 8 years after the events of the Dark Knight, I don't want to spoil the fun but I'm going to say the less possible: A new villain appears, a mercenary called Bane who wants to 'destroy' Gotham City (like everybody) then there's Bruce Wayne who has been inside his mansion for all those years doing nothing but recovering for the wounds that had in the previous two films...A new character out of nowhere appears, the amazing and personally favourite, Selina Kyle (funny thing is that she's indeed Catwoman but she's never called like that in the whole film). You'll see known characters like Jim Gordon, Alfred, Mr. Fox and (WARNING SPOILERS!!) the one we all love, Doctor Jonathan Crane aka. Scarecrow and Mr. Rash Al Gul himself!! (End of Spoilers!!)Now let's analyse the film...the acting is amazing...while in the previous film you saw how The Joker stole the entire show, in this film you can focus on Christian Bale playing as the best Bruce Wayne/Batman that has ever been. The other ones we already know play as well as the other films, I have to mention Mr. Michael Caine for making an amazing Alfred (you can see his real feelings in this movie) and the amazing actor Gary Oldman as Commisoner Gordon.The new adds? Bane is amazing, maybe he's not as 'awesome' or 'bad' as Joker but we all know that they are very different characters with very different ideas, Bane is indestructible and terrifying.The great actress Anne Hathaway is amazing as Selina Kyle aka. Catwoman...I have been a huge fan of Michelle Pfeiffer's work as Catwoman in 'Batman Returns' but in this new cast she looks more real and you can see her real purpose and feelings, she shines in all her scenes! The plot has its twists and its fails (fails only if you have been a real fan of Batman comics all these years) but is a very enjoyable film and the only thing I didn't like is that this is going to be the last film of this trilogy...This is a perfect film and has great action sequences but you may miss some of the epic and unforgettable scenes from the last film featuring the Joker like the interrogatory's or the hospital's...this is actually the only reason why I don't give it a perfect score...Now I'm going to try to talk about the ending without spoiling it...as the film is very dramatic, you may sheer a tear at the end...still is an amazing ending and I couldn't have written it better! I must congratulate to the whole cast, writers and director of the entire trilogy as this has become my number one!路 The Best: Plot, Batman, Catwoman, Bane...everything!! 路 The Worst: Absolutely nothing!!RATING: 9.8 / 10 !! The film of the year with no doubt!",10,3,7,21 July 2012
