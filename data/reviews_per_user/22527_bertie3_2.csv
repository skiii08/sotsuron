Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A very good film for the genre
","Come on, science fiction has rarely aspired to be Shakespearean. Why anyone would expect it to be anything but what it is - a fantasy meant to be eye candy and a great family film is utterly looking for something that one shouldn't. Look for great filmmaking in An Ideal Husband NOT in science fiction special effects films. Get over it! Otherwise I agree that it is a good film and one shouldn't listen to critics when it comes to SCIENCE FICTION.",10,5,7,7 July 1999
American History X," Better than I thought it would be
",I found this movie rather interesting and thrilling. It shows a different perspective on race relations than the usual movies do. I am sure some would find it kind of pedantic-but that is the point of the movie. You have to learn from your mistakes and one can be redeemed from racist acts. What better reason to be engaged in a movie rather than preached to?,9,0,0,9 April 2000
