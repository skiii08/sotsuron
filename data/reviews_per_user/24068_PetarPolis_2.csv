Casablanca," One word: WONDERFUL
","Me and my pals were talking for a long time about hiring Casablanca. So when I saw it on the library for free, I of course took the chance to lend it!The big day arrived - we were going to see the most classic movie of all time. And what an experience it was to se the movie. I mean, the movie was superb right from the start to the end. A MASTERPIECE! Very great performance by the actors too! A must see...Favorite quote(s): Ilsa Lund:   Play it once, Sam. For old times' sake.Sam:         I don't know what you mean, Miss Elsa.Ilsa Lund:   Play it, Sam. Play 'As Time Goes By.'Sam:         Oh, I can't remember it, Miss Elsa. I'm a little rusty on it.Ilsa Lund:   I'll hum it for you. Da-dy-da-dy-da-dum, da-dy-da-dee-da-dum... Sing it, Sam.Sam:         You must remember this / A kiss is still a kiss / A sigh is just a sigh / The fundamental things apply / As time goes by. / And when two lovers woo, / They still say, 'I love you' / On that you can rely / No matter what the future brings---Rick Blaine: Sam, I thought I told you never to play---

Dumb and Dumber," The funniest movie ever!
","The first time I saw this movie was with my dad, on the cinema... And know I tell you the truth: I have NEVER laughed as much as I did then. I mean, every scene in the movie was a danger for the annoying sound of my laugh. And when I saw the movie for the second time, I laughed as much as did the first time. And the third time, and the fourth time and the.... You can never get tired of this movie! This is a brilliant comedy! And Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels have never been funnier!Favorite quote(s): Harry: I can't believe we drove around all day, and there's not a single job in this town. There is nothing, nada, zip! Lloyd Christmas: Yeah! Unless you wanna work fourty hours a week.My vote: 10/10",10,0,2,6 January 2002
