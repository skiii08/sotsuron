E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," I watched a snail crawl along the edge of a straight razor.
","Unbelievably over-rated cack where, if you have any sense of fair play, you cannot wait for the little green man to die. You'll be disappointed. Spielberg cannot help but spray it on with an industrial blower.The horror. The horror",1,12,40,1 April 2002
12 Angry Men," Fonda is a true American
","Fonda plays this with perfect, reasoned, quietly persuasive understatement. This tale of justice played out in the jury room is a lesson for all those quick to punish and lacking in empathy.Now lets see Kissinger in the dock.",9,0,1,1 April 2002
Am√©lie," Pretty Vacant
","Beautifully shot, finely acted, but completely lacking a point.This film lacks tension and where it is attempts it, it makes no sense. It may make you smirk once or twice and the visuals will keep you to the end, but you'll come away wondering what the hell the fuss is all about.I'm a huge fan of French cinema but this is just whimsical nonsense.",5,6,11,28 April 2002
The Sixth Sense," If you can't guess the 'twist' before the end ...
","... then you probably gave this a 10. There's nothing particularly bad about this film and its watchable enough, but it lacks the 'what the hell's going on?' factor you'll find in other contemporary films such as 'Stir of Echoes,' though that too has a crappy ending. The kid is good though, but this film doesn't stand up to even the most basic analysis.",4,3,5,28 April 2002
