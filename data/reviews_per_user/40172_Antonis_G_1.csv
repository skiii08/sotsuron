Iron Man 3," No More, No Less....!
","Iron Man, more than most of the comic-book genre, relies on character and irreverence. This installment is no different, and Robert Downey Jr once again charms as Stark, the neurotic and egotistical superhero with no secret identity at all! The plot also incorporates the talents of Guy Pearce and Rebecca Hall as Aldrich Killian and Maya Hansen, respectively, characters and distant memories from Stark's past who return to challenge his authority..The movie was entertaining and well-made. It delivers some fantastic dialogue, sharp humor and incredible non-stop action sequences! Unlike most trilogies, one doesn't have to have followed the series to understand what's happening in Iron Man 3.The script is ambitious but NOT wise enough to be rightfully cathartic..",9,1,3,30 May 2013
