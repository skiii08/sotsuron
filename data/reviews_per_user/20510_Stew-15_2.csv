The Blair Witch Project," A great campfire story always beats a poor movie.
","This show has really made a marketing coup.  Sort of a Mercury Radio Theater 'War of the Worlds'.  I knew very little about the film until I read the synopsis at the marquee. I'm not a huge fan of film festival entries.  So, although the story kept me attentive, the major part of the production was not 'ringing my bell'.There was no gut and gore or shock, but the one sight of blood elicited more response than any 'shocker' seen in recent years. The conclusion of the film was riveting and unforgettable.  This film is a must-see.  The story concept and execution are really inspired.  In a world of digital wham-bam, visual shock, and mutilation films, it was fascinating to me to watch a crowd body-pierced Goths walk out of the theater with stunned expressions.It only proves what we film fans know within our hearts: A great campfire story always beats a poor movie.",8,1,2,19 July 1999
Pitch Black," Better Than Expected
","Yes, this film was better than I expected.  The film kept my attention from the start.  Cinematography is a real plus; and makes the locale very believable.You might find yourself questioning the basic eco-system of the planet. That seems to be hidden from our view, underground. . .   cause it sure isn't above ground.The cast kept my interest up, and although I hadn't seen them on film before, I'm positive I will see them again in the near future.  The suspense was well done. (Without the usual prolonged, 'walk-a-mile-down-the-hall-and-get-startled' things.)  I also did not dwell on gore.  Much was left to vivid imagination.Overall, it was worth the price of admission, and that is not always the case with a film of this genre.",8,0,0,19 March 2000
