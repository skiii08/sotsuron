Hereditary," I'm giving it 1/10 because I can't give it a zero
","This is my first ever review but I felt so strongly about abonination that I set up an account to warn others. I struggle to understand how anyone can score this as 9 or 10 out of 10. It is by far one of the worst films I've seen in some time, and that's saying something. Waiting to pay for parking as we left the cinema several people commented that they felt robbed having actually paid money to lose 2 hours of their lives that they'll never get back.
It markets itself as a horror despite not being remotely scary, in fact the supposed horror moments, all crammed into the last 20 minutes, play out like a pile of badly cobbled together cliches. It's as if the writers and director suddenly realised by the third act 'oh damn this was meant to be a horror' and threw in some pathetic attempts at scares. To sum it up in the words of Blackadder it starts poor, peters off in the middle and the less said about the end the better. However, in this case, the end is worth mentioning as it goes about explaining itself and actually caused a few people to laugh in the cinema, it really was THAT BAD.
The acting part? Collette does a decent turn as someone in grief and possibly losing her marbles, Byrne looks bored by it all and is perhaps just short of a few quid so he took the role and the young lad who plays the son could quite easily have been replaced by a cardboard cut out and saved on the wages.
Good parts? There were a couple, the background music was classic horror chill but its just a shame that nothing remotely horrific or chilling happened. ****SPOILER ALERT****** The scene where the daughter loses her head (by this point I wish I had) was nicely done and caused a fair few jumps sadly the next couple of minutes of pure stupidity, on the part of the writers/director, totally ruined the scene. Additionally there were a couple (as in 2) scenes where apparitions of the departed were seen in the dark corner of the room and these were genuinely a little creepy but unfortunately a combined 10 seconds is not enough to save the next 2 hours of total tosh. This really leaves me with just the last few minutes. I think the director must have a few too many to drink and suddenly decided 'I know what we need, a few random naked people' for absolutely no reason whatsoever. Incidentally, for those who are partial to a bit of on screen nudity, there really wasn't anything pleasant to see.
Do yourselves a favour and wait until this badly polished turd makes it onto TV or Netflix then you can sit through it and laugh your backsides off at people like me who actually paid money to watch this in the cinema.",1,17,40,24 June 2018
