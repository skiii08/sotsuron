Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The best movie ever
","This was one of the best movies ever made. Just because it may not have been better than the original trilogy some of you people vote it down, well that is your own problem. This film put faith back in the hearts of many people, not many things in this world can do a thing like that. So those of you who voted anything less than a nine, get mental help.",10,1,2,20 March 2000
