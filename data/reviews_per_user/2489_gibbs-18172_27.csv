The Longest Yard," Not as good as the original
","I think he's **** his pants is the line that is changed for perhaps the most memorable line from the 70s classic. If you don't know what I refer to then you should watch the original Burt Reynolds version.Yep I know Burt stars in this one as well, this version is made funnier if you tie up the two.Not a classic Sandler film but not the worse.
Stars from WWE as apposed to 70s WWF. Not an American football fan but you don't have to be to get some enjoyment.One of those pass the time fims, maybe a little too long at 1hr 50",7,0,0,14 February 2020
Erin Brockovich," Pretty woman in murky waters
","Watched again and still as it all.
Well balanced out true to life movie well before the Flint fiasco and gave Roberts a chance to show that she could actually act seriously instead of Running off in a wedding gown etc. Her Colour Purple moment.At over 2hrs (just) its perfect to story tell and cover the angles. A movie that you will watch more than once and one that should fill you anger due to the facts its based on.",9,0,0,14 March 2020
Monster," Charlize Theron is uncannily like Wuornos
","I didn't know a film had made about the infamous serial killer Aileen Wuorons and just 2 years after her execution in 2002.
Having watched 2 fabulous documentaries with Wuorons I had to give it a try. Very glad I did , i can see how but why she was disturbed also some of the injustice which I won't spoil.I don't agree with the death penalty, personally for this person she needed to be in hospital for the rest of her days.The American system of an eye for an eye simply is ineffective",9,2,3,20 August 2019
Inglourious Basterds," Another great scalp for Tarantino
","As per the Stars line up whenever Quentin is in town and this parody of the inglorious bastards is just classic Hitler piss take. I never really watched his films until my wife left, well apart from Pulp Fiction which i wasn't a fan of so i kept a distance on purpose.
Ive only punished myself by doing so and if you don't watch this then you are missing out. OK not Django quality but still worth a bowl of popcorn n a big slurp size soda.",8,1,2,12 March 2020
Stripes," Lean, Mean, 8
","Come on, this film as 2 ghostbusters in it.... Its well worth more than a 7 and i almost gave it a 9.One of those i remember watching on the Philips 2000 video machine... Yeah we were that family neither VHS or Betamax lolAnyway young at the time i remember it and always will for introducing me to john candy, the reason for a 8 not a 9 is so i can mark future john candy reviews higher. The comic legend deserves it.Worth a view",8,0,1,25 February 2020
The Irishman," A fantastic film but not Goodfellas
","I'm not going to follow the mad hype and score it 10, if I could I might give 9.5 but there have been better films that have brought together the talents of Scorsese, DeNiro, Pesci and Pacino.
Sad thing is that this could be the very last time we see this great acting trio together on screen.Shout out to Stephen Graham who has come on miles since This is England and just seems to be in so many projects nowadays.It's a great 3+ hours of story telling but if you have watched Goodfellas a few times you have to mark this lower",9,1,2,1 December 2019
Orphan," Mardy nardy yardy hey ! Not bad
","Seen better , seen worse .
Giveaway that she is a bad egg more or less stright away.Typical ' No one sees what I see and they all think I'm crazy ' film . Except for the one person who's brain as yet to develop pass 1st grade and for some reason keeps it quiet.Yep it's the average Yank family being terrorised film but its no poltergeist in fact its no bettlejuice",7,0,0,25 July 2019
Yes Man," Yes! This movie had an ending
","Yardy yar yar yar blah! No need to gloss this one over, it's Jim Carrey with a younger way more hotter girl pulling funny faces in a pickle where he can't stop doing or saying a significant thing that marrys up to the title.(I'm gonna copy and paste this review)",6,1,1,3 April 2020
Snatch," 21st century classic made in year 2000
","At the end of this century this will still be one of the cult classic films and if not the no1 British classic deffo in the top 10.
20 years gone and it's still the best.Some Yanks don't get it from the mid west or south . That's a shame its just the funniest film for a long time.",10,0,1,14 August 2019
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," Fabulous
","Although it's x amount years old I've just stumbled across this film. I thought it was a more modern take on the original not reading up on the prime video synopsis. Yet it was the musical brought to the big screen.No silly dick van dyke cockney accents here. Just story telling through song and great on stage visual action.Depp and Carter are outstanding.I get annoyed with myself when my ignorance as failed me, why did I not see this earlier?
Don't make my mistake. I put this on to fall to sleep to, after almost 2hrs I was fulfilled with my new find.",9,1,1,16 September 2019
Horrible Bosses," Marmite
","I don't usually like Marmite, I spit it out. But this was like a new improved flavour to me.
I just know that it will have many critical reviews, some pointing out errors etc FFS.Just sit back and laugh, of course it's unbelievable, it's not a history documentary.",8,0,1,12 February 2020
Bird Box," Great movie to watch once.
","I really enjoyed watching this at the start of 2019 i predicted it would be one of my favourite movies of the year.Come to 2020 and the 2nd viewing, yep still ok, unique idea etc but just missing to much story of how we get from point A to 5 years later and you spot the flaws, maybe there are more but what i missed 1st time i noticed 2nd.If you haven't seen this, watch it. But be contempt at what you have",7,1,3,28 February 2020
Hot Rod," I'm keeping this hat!
","Lorne Michaels doesn't put his hand to many SNL spin offs and although these are new characters they wreak of that Saturday Night excellence.Some comedy's have 2 or 3 memorable moments or lines, this is just cramped full, from start to end.If you don't find the comic irony in this movie that sends up at least half a dozen other films then you shouldn't be watching class like this.Does Isla Fisher ever age? She barely looks any older than Shannon from Home and Away, a childhood crush I had in my teens.Bill Harer makes everything that much funnier. I'm tempted to give this a 10 but I've only discovered it in 2020.Ive been dodging it because the write up on Netflix was corny, but of course it was.This film can easily hold a top ten funniest moments. That's my opinion. Whilst I respect others, why is it that when some people on here want to rate a film as a 1 they leave about 5-10 reviews straight after each other.
We know it's you! The same person, just because no one else agrees they have to be heard. Pathetic, we should only be able to comment on an item once.Who is this person leaving 8 1s in a row, get a sense of humour on your bucket list.",9,1,2,11 February 2020
American Psycho," Just an average Trump voter, No?
","One of those never seen anything like before and 20 yrs later, yes 20! Still never seen anything like it since.PSYCHO is probably to Liberal of a term for some, for others its understatingChristian Slater probably put out his best ever performance here mainly talking to himself.Its funny how the 2000 type cast lives in the Donald Trump America",9,2,5,14 March 2020
Dallas Buyers Club," Sometimes you just try the right movie
","WOW! Powerful, Emotional Roller-coaster, hard hitting and very difficult to watch and understand how we as humans can watch others suffer while we know we can save them.I thought I'd give this 5mins after the initial Netflix ad preview, stayed the duration and didn't notice it had got dark and I was sat alone in the house with no lights on.Full of 80s prejudice, machco man bull crap and lost hope.I say things about my country a lot because it matters but we can't get our heads around this America. If we are sick we have a hospital bed. And we don't pay a lot. That's 'fake news'I hope some day films like this will be history lessons. Very powerful",10,0,1,11 February 2020
The Pianist," Never Forget, I shall remember this classic
","One of the greatest bio-pics I've seen regarding the natzi invasion of Europe. Not focusing on the death camps but the ghettos that Jews and those deemed sub par to Germans.We should never forget how families were ripped apart, brutalised and robbed & raped.One man's struggle just to stay alive and to remember his love of the piano his gift that no one can take.It's also a portrayal of the real uprising that was ultimately unsuccessful but in many ways a huge success as it showed bravery v tirany.There is so much story to this film that 2hr 28m passes by quickly.Get a big bowl of popcorn, a xl drink and a box of tissues",10,1,2,11 February 2020
Django Unchained," Watch it again and again
","This was my induction to Quentin Tarantino, yes I left it late but that's a cross I have to bare. I suppose turning Pulp Fiction off halfway through when I was pissed shouldn't have clouded my judgement.Christopher Waltz is brilliant and overnight became one of my favourite actors. This top billed cast of QTs regulars fit in snuggly to their rolls.The 2 and half hours plus never seems that long and the story never looses its thread.A great take on Western meets pre cival war America with more than a hint of irony.A very rare 10",10,0,1,5 April 2020
Schindler's List," Captivating throughout
","True story of Oscar Schindler, a World War II profiteer who made a fortune from slave labour making artillery.
Learning about the final solution Oscar as a crisis of conscience when it comes to loosing his work force.Get your children to watch this, sit with them and explain it. I'm a 46yr Brit and I'm an atheist but no matter where or whatever faith we must never forget.",10,0,1,1 December 2019
Kick-Ass," Everything I love about spoofs & a bit extra
","I hate new style super hero movies. I'm more of a late 70s early 80s Superman fan. It took me a while to give this a go and I did because of an off the cuff comment I saw about kick ass 2 on TV.So I started to watch and was immediately hooked, the more it went on the hooked I got.
Over surprised by the amount of profanity and violence in the film but also the way it married into the comedy. Now remember my hate of modern super heroes, I don't watch,but I'd guess there's some piss taking out of certain ones within the script etc.I loved it, wouldn't recommend it for very young children but that's me.Very good indeed",10,0,0,14 February 2020
Green Street Hooligans," As if Millwall would get this far in Cup
","Yeah, run of Mill film about hooligans and the crap soccer clubs they follow.
In all honesty it makes it look more like little brawls outside a takeaway on a Saturday night in Wakefield city centre.
Even the climax has the feeling of anti init with what is an unrealistic twist.The pioneer of the footy hooligan film was and still is I. D., and this the effect of the Police is just none existent.Also the probability of wanting to avange something so terrible but waiting years to see if you get drawn in the F. A. Cup together when you live 6 miles away is a joke.",6,0,0,12 March 2020
Pretty Woman," I longed to leave a review
",Everything that sucked about the dawn of the 90s and the ending of the greatest decade in all time since the big bang it's self ..... or the 7th day for those who believe in magic.,3,0,3,25 July 2019
Pitch Perfect 2," Perfect sequel
","I felt silly watching the first instalment of the franchise, then guilt then i thought forget you to the ney sayers.The first pitch perfect hit all the right notes.Surely a fluke, can't do it again can they?Yes they can, all back with new goals to fullfill. Its just fun and if you have a sense of humour and dont take everything to seriously you might just get this movie.From Elie Banks to Rebel Wilson, Anna Kendrick to the Green Bay Packers another brilliant cast delivers",8,0,0,28 February 2020
Carrie," Original and the best version by far
","Way back in 76 before Danny Zuco had tried winning the heart of Sandy or had been struck down with Saturday Night Fever he was slaughtering pigs and knocking around with girls that were still in college ( yes i know he went back to Rydale High later).
He was also terrorising Sissy Spaceck who out of 4 attempts (76,02,12 carrie 2 rage) the queen of them all.I will pick apart the others in their own reviews but this classic King adoption remains one of his finest works, one of the greatest films i saw as a kid on videotape and without the multi million CGI and SFX that we have now or what the other 2 versions had in the 21st century at their disposal.This depended on good old fashioned acting capabilities, you feel for Carrie from the Start and Sissy takes you with her on such a ride that at the end you actually cheer inside even though you know its wrong.A tale of the bully and the bullied both loosing. I dont give 10s out often but Stephen King does have a habit of getting high marks although i dont watch horror movies much this is one i enjoy returning to every so often.Not seen it? You must...",10,2,2,21 March 2020
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," So finally !
","After being taken as a near 4yr old who fell asleep and missed it all at Wakefield ABC cinema back in 74 with my mam n dad plus mi brother and 2 sisters ( i was the baby) i finally got to watch it again.Well that not really true , i got bored after the reading then came the acting and once i got a notification about my gummy drop game that was it . So yeah i could write a couple of things i saw and be spoiler for the other 4 people who haven't seen it yet but id be telling then to stay clear . Its horrible, zzzzzzzzzzz.
Sorry",3,1,3,19 June 2019
Gangs of New York," Fulfilling and captivating throughout
",Unlike some others I have to score this high in fact I wish I could score 9.5 but I can't.Yeah a lot of it is fairytails how much beatings one man can take but I really enjoyed this film and any chance to see Cameron Diaz,9,4,5,14 August 2019
True Romance," quentin tarantino movie! nuff said
",Can't really believe that I've put off watching this until 2020. Just great throughout. Only thing that bothers me now with a Tarantino movie is thinking which poor soul suffered behind the scenes because of that filthy octopus Harvey Weinstein. That aside its a great flick and well worthy of that very rare 10,10,1,1,7 February 2020
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," The Step Brothers Need For Speed
","A barrel full of lols, the thing I love about Will Ferell movies is when kids are involved and the SNL inside of Will comes crashing out in the characters.It's a little slapstick but there's some real good moments of belly laughter, it's a comedy so job done again.",9,0,0,8 February 2020
