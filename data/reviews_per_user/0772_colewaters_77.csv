Blade Runner 2049," Fantastic movie
","Blade Runner 2049 is one fantastic movie that just needs to be seen. Harrison Ford, Ryan Gosling, and Jared Leto what a cast those three powerhouse actors together equals Oscar nominations. This film from start to finish is a thrill ride. This movie was way more entertaining then the original and better film then the original. The 3D in this movie is like no other it is mind blowing. Parents this movie is rated R for Vilonce some sexual nudity and language throughout. It is not a kid friendly film, but if they saw the original then this will be nothing for them. I recommend this movie for everyone who loved the first Blade Runner movie and even if you did not like the first one I think you will love this one. The only thing that I did not like was the 2 hours and 43 minutes, but it did not bother me enough to give it a 9 star ratingThank You for reading hope my review was helpfulMy score 10/10",10,4,16,8 October 2017
It," IT has the IT factor
","IT has the It factor. The star of the movie was for sure Bill Skarsg√•rd he put the name Pennywise in the word horror. He was just plain out terrifying. I have not seen a movie this damn good in a very long time. It was just not the best movie of the year it was the best movie I have ever seen in the theaters and I just didn't see it once, but twice. By far Bill Skarsg√•rd should win an Oscar for Best actor and the movie itself should win for Best feature film.Parents IT is rated R and when you see Bill Skarsg√•rd's Pennywise you will see why it is just plain out scary. It will definitely make everyone wet there pants that is how Scarry it is. I recommend to wear more the one pair of underwear to make sure you don't wet yourself. Hope you enjoy IT.HERE TAKE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!You'll Float Too",10,14,28,16 September 2017

The 3D was the best 3D I have seen in a very long time, and I go to a lot of 3D movies so that is saying a lot coming from me. It had a great cast who brought the chearecters from a comic book to a live action movie that is now a house hold name and will probably be one for a long time.Parents this movie is not like Deadpool that is R rated and super sexual it is PG-13 rated and it is very intense throughout the film. So if you feel that your kid can handle this much of action then let's see how they handle it because this movie is pushing the PG-13 rating a lot.",10,4,9,10 November 2016

The Lonely Island are legends and after this movie it will get them even bigger then they already are.The movie was a hit in my books.

Dunkirk," Dunkirk IMAX
","Dunkirk is by far the best movie of the year so far. If you are going to see Dunkirk you have to see it in IMAX. The acting was fantastic especially by Harry Styles as Alex. This is one of those films that when you watch it you know you are with them. Christopher Nolan did it once again with another great film. Every second of the film was shot perfectly as every camera was put on the object like the cockpit had a camera on it. Dunkirk was a brutal battle and this movie proves that it was brutal.Parents yes this movie is rated PG-13, but it was rated that problem just because Harry Styles is in it because if he was not in it it would be R. This movie was extremely intense the whole time so if you don't want your kids to see it and they want to tell them when they get older because they would love it. Dunkirk is by far a great film that needs to be seen, but really in IMAX.Thanks for reading and I hope you enjoy it.My score 10/10",10,4,11,22 July 2017

I was on team Iron Man because Iron Man is great.Parents this movie has a lot of brutal action sequences in it so if you don't want your kids to be exposed to that yet don't take them to see this even though it is plain out amazing film. The movie was non stop herotastic in every shape and form if you want a great action flick then this is the perfect movie to go see.Now go get your popcorn and enjoy,10,3,9,7 June 2016

Frozen," How can it be good
","When people speak of their favorite Disney movies, the big four of the Renaissance and films of the Golden Age of animation are likely to be mentioned. The past decade has seen Disney movies that were hit or miss. Some considered classics, some forgotten and some close to being classics but not there yet. Frozen changes this dynamic and creates a full fledged classic. Frozen IS not just a classic, it is THE Disney classic of the decade. It could position itself up there with the best of them. Disney returns to its roots with a vengeance. The best animated film of the past few years in my opinion. The story is heart melting, filled with the pure feeling and heart that has become a staple with the best Disney movies. It is a moving story that has family at its center. It is unpretentious in what it is trying to portray. The comedy hits right on the mark and the action packed adventure and thrilling journey make this a tale with a little bit of everything in the exact right amounts. It is a daring movie that is laugh out loud at the some moments and stunning and provoking at others. All achieved in balance. A true triumph in story telling that proves exactly what Disney does best and again proving that they are back to producing top quality films. This is an affecting human story, one that is significant. Startling and stunning, beautifully envisioned, emotionally powerful and relevant. Gorgeous visuals, stunning backdrops and intricacies like you have never seen before. The environments, the costumes, the character movements among other things make this film a gigantic step forward. The brilliant voice talents that breath life into this project need to be applauded and then some. The cast consisting of Kristen bell (Veronica Mars) and Idina Menzel(Wicked!)among many others bring winning charm, superior voice acting and magnificent vocals as well as heart to this tale. The sensational wit and humor, the arrays of different personalities, their emotions, their triumphs and falls make them some of the most interesting characters that people can relate to and some of the best i have seen in animation. The cast fully become the characters.The score and music is perfect. The score is grand. The sound, the texture, the harmony, the melody is in a class of its own. Above and beyond anything attempted by the animation studio in the past decade. I would place the songs up there with those of the 90's movies and 2000's Enchanted. A true all round musical triumph. Songs that will be stuck in your mind and you will be humming them and you won't even know it. And some you will be belting out at the top of your lungs because they are that good. Songs that progress the story and an essential part of it.So you have meticulously crafted breath taking animation, an affecting tale of the bond of family, romance, hilarious wit and humor courtesy of the characters especially sweet Olaf and heart stopping adventure. A true fairy tale that i would say could very well be The Little Mermaid or The Beauty and The Beast of this generation. FROZEN has that Disney MAGIC that has been missing for so long and it comes in full force here.Fantastico",10,4,11,7 June 2016
Schindler's List," Triumph
","Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me. I give the film an 'A+' (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10... Best movie",10,9,13,7 June 2016
