Hereditary," Dull nonsense
",It's starts well but very quickly begins to drag until the last few minutes which are ridiculous. Half the cinema was giggling at the end that how stupid this film goes.,4,14,34,21 June 2018
A Star Is Born," Too long, too dull, too predictable
","Ok, this isn't the normal type of film I go and see but I found almost nothing appealing about it. It dragged on and on with almost nothing happening and when Coppers character committed suicide near the end I was jealous of him for escaping watching anymore of this tat.",3,46,89,7 October 2018
The Irishman," Pensioner gangstars
","I could only manage the first half an hour. It may have got better, I don't know but the first half an hour was slow and tedious. I love Scorceses other gangster film but this had none of their flair or pace and just felt old and withered. It was quite sad to see de Niro and Peshi tarted up trying to play men half their age, they had none of their former swagger and the fight scenes were very pathetic.",4,4,10,8 December 2019
La La Land," Drab, dull and predictable
","Absolutely baffling why people go crazy for this. It's dull, neither of the leads can sing and it's predictable. I'm not mad about musicals but compare this to something like West Side Story or even Oklahoma and it pales in comparison.",4,0,2,4 May 2018
The King," Would have been better if they'd read a history book
","Doesn't follow history or Shakespeare, the main protagonist were nothing like their characters in history. I'm a bit of a historian so got quite annoyed at this film.
Other than that I found it very bleak and slow. The fight scenes were more realist than the normal over the top ones but on the whole it was quite dull",5,148,241,1 November 2019
Black Panther," Can't fathom the hype
","This is not a good film. The plot is dull and predictable. The fight scenes are all over the place. Almost, but not quite, as bad as Daredevil",5,1,1,19 May 2018
