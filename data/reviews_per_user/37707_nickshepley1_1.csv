Requiem for a Dream," Simply Stunning. Direction 10, Acting 10, Storyline 10 Power 11
","By far and out, the most powerful film I have ever seen. The direction of the film is stunning, the acting is stunning, and by the end of it, you shall deeply moved by the journey these 4 people have been on. This film has been a key reason to why I have not done drugs in my lifetime. I'm sure the film can be enjoyed by both people pro-drugs and anti-drugs, but seriously this is a must see film for anybody (over 18). It is not a film that you can watch over and over again, believe me, I don't thing any body could deal with the amount of emotion this film puts you through, but YOU must see it. If you're wanting a joyful experience this is not it!! Go and watch Home Alone etc...If you want to be moved, arguably more than any other cinematic experience can, then Darren Aronofsky has put this on a plate for you. ENJOY!",10,0,1,5 December 2012
