Your Name.," Shinkai goes feel-good anime!
","Among all the other works of Makoto Shinkai, I must say that this is undoubtedly my favorite. This is not as slow as 5C/S. It has the rhythm that perfectly blends with the lighthearted music. I must also mention how I love the random quick frames and some more symmetrical shots. Aside from the animation, the movie's plot and tone offer such an engaging story. I like this Shinkai's story-telling style. It is not rushed. He takes his time to reasonably develop all the characters and every situation. He makes animated romantic stories not an isolating genre to watch. Although, again perhaps the love story is just but a secondary part of the whole story. While it is categorized as sci-fi fantasy, it is also sprinkled with a slice of life touch and that's another thing I enjoy watching in some Shinkai's movies. It is unpretentious. The mundanity is not torturing but it is something that you savor and love. Everyone should see this. It's a perfect movie for fall. It's lovely!",7,7,16,15 September 2016
