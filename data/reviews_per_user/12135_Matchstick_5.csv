Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Perhaps The Funniest Movie Ever..
","I'm kind of a comedy snob. Growing up in Chicago, the home of Second City and homestead of our comedic Canadian brothers and sister, I grew up with a deep appreciation of comedy. Been to many a comedy club and seen many a shitty act. Main influences: classic Jack Benny, Lenny Bruce, Richard Pryor, SCTV, SNL (74-87)..this list goes on. Comedic acts are the one thing; they can be spontaneous and brilliant. However, it's very hard to put that comedy and energy on film. Cohen has done this here; it's a masterpiece on several levels. How foolish we Americans can be with our racist views in the camera lens..how backwards other parts of the world can be (although characterized) and how we really don't know much about each other when it boils down.It was the only movie that I saw since 'Blazing Saddles' that the audience and myself were just laughing out loud from minute to minute, joke to joke..Haven't seen that forever. And some of the stuff in that movie was just outrageous and shocking. And my sense of humor is way out there. Cohen is a genius, and not for the shock value, but for the fact that he just made a character that leaves us thinking about humanity and how we view each other in the fish eyed lens the media and the internet. It was hilarious and I highly recommend it to Americans esp. but to anyone who has a sense of humor. It will make you see how stupid humanity really is in the long run. It's a healthy dose of humility for us Americans and also a chance to laugh at the human race in General.",10,1,11,24 November 2006
Ali," Too Bad...
","Wow, this movie could have been so much more. The scenes were too long, the story lacked focus and in the end I feel like I got cheated out of what should have been a great movie. Will Smith turns in the performance of his life! Did he bulk up or what? Man, he looked pumped. Jon Voight was great and Mario Van Peebles proved that he is not the worst black actor in Hollywood (close though), he did a good job as Malcolm X. Good actors doing great characterizations starring in a poor movie. Too bad.",6,0,1,20 June 2002
The Big Lebowski," I guess we could call it a classic period piece by now...
","This movie has certainly gained cult status and nothing I could say would persuade any reader to watch it because if you are reading this review you are one of the 99% of the people who absolutely love this flick.Growing up in the Chicago area my dad was the manager of a bowling alley for 30 years and I was a bowling alley rat as a kid. This film is especially funny to me because I remember characters like 'The Dude' and Walter Sobczak drinking and bowling all the time. A lot of wing nuts hang at the lanes, which to me, made the story even more plausible. LOL. I remember the late 80's & early 90's and they captured the ambiance of the bowling alley crowd perfectly. I adore this movie.The movie is hilarious but this is something you already know. I have a soft spot in my heart for the scene after Donnie has the heart attack and the next scene is a really cool pan of the lanes and the bowlers as Townes Van Zandt pines the Rolling Stones' 'Dead Flowers' live as a backdrop; a really great combination of great Coen brothers and great music. Sadly, Townes Van Zandt died a year before this came out, which makes me wonder if they put that song in there as a tribute to him, and also fitting with Donnie's death; both are sad moments.And remember: 'That's right, nobody f*cks with the Jesus!'",10,1,2,18 November 2005
The Thing," Desert Island Movie Keeper !!!
","This is perhaps one of the most under-rated, yet best sci-fi/horror movies ever made. It's hard to believe that this movie is almost 25 years old but it has aged well and looks as fresh as ever.John Carpenter has made some good films here and there but made A lot of dogs. However, sometimes...and I mean once in a lifetime kind of 'sometimes'...everything will click and you got yourself one damned fine film. This is Carpenter's 'click'.Ingredients: A great premise story by the late John W. Campbell Jr., an absolutely spectacular ensemble cast who, even back then was somewhat unknowns but they all cut their teeth on the stage. I mean really, Richard Dysart, W. Brimley, Peter Maloney, D. Moffat, Richard Masur and Tom Waites, all damn fine stage actors. Sorry to name drop but the producers either were brilliant and/or extremely lucky to pull off this cast for an ensemble piece about paranoia. Great cast! And to really put the icing on the cake they have the edgy special effects guy, Rob Bottin, who was really just a kid at the time pulling off amazing special effects (yes, this is before CGI, kiddies) with a budget that I use to buy groceries with. He was years ahead of his time.The litmus test for me was to show this to my 15 yr. old son and a few of his buddies one Friday night. They were glued to the TV; from the opening scene where the Norwegians were shooting the wolf from the helicopter to the end scene where Mac and Childs make veiled paranoid small talk amidst the carnage that was once their camp. They loved it and were blown away when I told them how old it was, but I think the scene with Mac and that lame chess computer sort of dates it. LOL.If you watch this on DVD, make sure you see the Collector's Edition from Universal. 5.1 sound with bullets whizzing by your head. This would be one of the five movies that I would take to my deserted island bungalow. Heh.",10,0,1,30 November 2005
Garden State," Good movie about self-revelation, introspection and forgivness.. Great soundtrack too.
","This movie reminds me a lot of 'Beautiful Girls' and it's ironic that Natalie Portman is in this movie as well (only grown up and leagal :P) I think this was a great freshman effort on Zach Braff's part. It's not a solid movie, but it isn't too shabby either. The soundtrack was really great; tied scenes in with needle and thread. I've only seen Wes Anderson & Owen Wilson pull this off before in 'Rushmore' and ' Royal Tenenbaums ', where the songs compliment the movie to such a degree.Anyway, worth the watch! I hope Braff will be making some movies soon.This movie reminds me a lot of 'Beautiful Girls' and it's ironic that Natalie Portman is in this movie as well (only grown up and leagal :P) I think this was a great freshman effort on Zach Braff's part.
