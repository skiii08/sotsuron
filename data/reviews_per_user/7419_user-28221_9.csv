United 93," The most moving part of this film is about human nature
","What is the most moving part of this film? Well there are a lot of parts that are moving indeed and different people have their different moments in mind, and for me, this is a great film, and the greatest part is that when the passengers are praying to God, the terrorists are praying too, to their god... This is so amazing... I'm not talking about whose god is the true god or which religion is the true religion; what I am trying to say is the case is people's religions, or beliefs, especially when the chips are down, are truly just what they think or assume they can rely on... When I saw everybody on the plane pray, I laughed, yet I was very clear that it is human nature: you know it probably won't help but as long as you assume there is some hope, you'll still do it, BECAUSE YOU WANNA SUVIVE... Their religious beliefs are what they call upon for help, and it makes no difference if the help is from Christianity or Islam, because it's all just fake hope...",10,2,5,18 February 2009
Inglourious Basterds," Forget about the sheer enjoyment and watch it again
","Well I myself is a big fan of QT and love all of his movies, but loving a movie doesn't make it a good movie, especially when it comes to movies with intoxicating charms of QT... you wanna give a moderate review, you gotta watch twice, calmly...I must say the first time I watched this movie that experience is just incredible! I watched it right before I went to bed and I was so thrilled that I even dreamed about stabbing people in the faces and shooting them in the testicles... But then the next morning when I woke up, as a long time movie fan I started to think that this movie actually has a lot of flaws. That's what a sensible movie fan would think about ain't that? For instance when we see the character intro of the Hugo guy, we are so excited and wanna see him do some stuff with the IB who he has 'gone pro' with, but the crazy guy just dies before he does any fun stuff. That is disappointing ain't that? And as for the vengeance of the jew girl, it just could have been A LOT MORE powerful if only QT had wished to. And the bear jew guy and other IB members, they could have been more like characters that we won't forget in a long time if only QT had wished to! To do those is really easy for him, just think about pulp fiction and reservoir dogs, we do remember every character in them don't we? But in IB, I guess 20 years later from now(it has been almost 20 years since reservoir dogs), we will only remember brad pitt and the jew hunter.Those are some of the flaws I caught, but I can sort of imagine why QT didn't care about those flaws, they are pretty big ones though... JUST SEE AND FEEL THE CINEMATOGRAPH!!! And I am talking about the camera movement language, it's just so good!! Literally every message the director wants to convey, the camera can do the work! In the first chapter, the movement between french guy's face, jew hunter's smile, and the floor board, and the people underneath it, well buddy, movies just don't get too much better than this do they? Not to mention the cigarette thrown in the air to burn down the films and every 'branding scene'... Apart from the camera, the acting is nearly as great! Brad Pitt and jew hunter, I'd vote for them for Academy Award this year.Again, QT hasn't yet got off his track of making funny and technically-textbook movies, IB is so great. But wanna say this is his most perfect one? oh you ain't gonna say that... Or, this guy just doesn't wanna make movies that are perfect, cuz it ain't fun.",8,1,5,26 November 2009
The Shining," Why so scary?
","1. REPUTATION You've heard about how scary it is; you know who Stanley Kubrick is and what his films are like... And you probably will think to yourself: hey, some of this guy's other films, which are not necessarily known for scariness, are very scary indeed.(2001: A Space Odyssey is pretty scary isn't it?) Now this is his horror movie! It's gotta be scary!2. MUSIC The Shining's score is indeed the best score in history, not one of the best, it is the best! Music to film is like colour to picture, yet, in The Shining, music is even more vital, because it is an invisible actor. It plays all of the ghosts in the movie. So deeply powerful, petrifying!3. SETTING Just imagine... Freezing winter with heavy snow, isolated huge old house, maze of rooms in the house...4. CASTING This should never be ignored. Casting for Danny and his mom is just perfect.5. CINEMATOGRAPHY AND EDITING ... ...(about this, speechless I am)6. UNKNOWNNESS Many remain wondering about the idea and theme of The Shining after seeing it for many times. They guess and argue. There has come out so many explanations now, some of which are truly imaginary! But regardless of how much people guess and argue, the movie is still like a mystery. Yet it is just the unknownness that has made it so intriguing, so enchanting, so...horrifying... Exactly like the director himself.",10,0,0,10 February 2009
Batman Begins," something better than being perfect
","Not talking about something Begins has, this something is what Begins doesn't have. But begins indeed is a perfect movie, so perfect script and story-telling, so perfect acting from all-star casting, cinematography, action scenes, messages conveyed to audience... All so perfect just... call me fussy but really a movie needs something that's better than being perfect, something beyond that, something we can't handle, something that breaks the balance, something wrong...Something like the joker in Dark Knight...Yeah there we are, villains in Begins are not crazy enough to get to the level of the joker, and that's why although this really is a perfect movie, it still could be better. Nolan you are the man to make stuff like that so I'm not that fussy I assume.This something doesn't always have to be characters, it could be a surprise in the plot too, like the ending of Seven. I guess it could be quite a lot of things. Also if a not that good movie has something like that it could still has a special place in audience's heart, Brown Bunny for instance.",9,2,4,30 November 2009
Good Will Hunting," A gay's view on a beautiful boy
","Actually Good Will Hunting is one of my so-called favorite movies, about it I have too much to say, which makes me speechless every time I wanna say something about it. I love it so much and have seen it for more than 10 times. Recently I found something really interesting in this movie, which is, apart from those main ideas, also remarkable.We know Gus Van Sant is a gay and enjoyed filming gays in his early days, after which more and more people got to know and like him and he made quite a few great films not about gays. But apparently from those 'straight' movies we can still see his preference. In Good Will Hunting, we see, from Sant's eyes, Matt as a pretty beautiful boy, eyes reflected by the mirror when writing on it carefully; sitting in the bus alone and looking outside the window thinking about his life; reading big books every night before sleeping in his small room; talking with Sean by the river looking at him while he's talking, shocked speechless... These all seem to me to be a gay director's view on a beautiful boy, not another boy's view, not a man's view, not a girl's view either. But don't get me wrong, it's never evil; on the contrary, it's beautiful.",10,1,4,13 February 2009
The Dark Knight," A movie doesn't have to be perfect to completely amaze you!
","I really hate those censorious critics. When everyone is saying The Dark Knight is truly one of the top five movies in the whole history and the movie itself is becoming really popular, someone laughs coldly and says things like 'this is the most overrated movie ever made'. And if you go deeper to their ideas, you find all they have done is pick up the small detailed flaws of the movie, which is completely not affecting the whole quality and worthiness of seeing more than twice of the movie. Hey boy, WHY SO SERIOUS? I wonder if those people work in a watch factory, in which you are never allowed to make a single tiny mistake because if you do, you will ruin the whole work. Movie is art, and art is never perfect. Its imperfection is the very thing that makes it amazing.The Dark Knight is not perfect, or in other word, can anyone name a literally perfect movie? Is Godfather perfect, or The Shawshank Redemption? But they are indeed amazing aren't they? I really think The Dark Knight should be even longer, maybe three hours will do. This is a so complex multi-layer script, for many directors it's too hard to tell the story and make it clear to the audience. The Nolans made it, although not 100 percent, but they did make it understood plus shining plus intriguing! If the movie were long enough, the story-telling would be even more clear and very importantly, not that tied up, which is the biggest shortage of The Dark Knight.Then it's time to talk about why it is so amazing. I hate to say everything in the movie is great because that's over-simplifying and showing no respect for the standing out. THE JOKER, it's him who makes the movie different. It's not only about Heath's acting,(actually I have no idea how to describe how great his acting is, it simply defies description) it's about the role. Many marvel that this joker is the NO1 villain of the history, indeed he is, why? Because he never deserves anyone's mercy, in other words, he is, in absolute terms, bad, bad enough to go way beyond the punishment people make to measure the fierceness of bad. He is a villain that will stay longer in your heart and control your thoughts than your best hero image can do. A hero is an example; a villain like the joker is an obsession.So I suggest you not fall too deep in love with The Dark Knight and the joker, although I already have.",10,4,8,6 February 2009
The Wrestler," The movie is very pure inside
","I believe if I were about the same age with The Ram I would probably love this movie even more. And the fact is I am much younger than him yet I can hardly love this movie better. It's not just the acting of Mickey that makes me relate to The Ram; it's the script that added to it. The end is absolutely unique among the genre. These years a lot of films centered on a sports team or individual struggling to make their way back to top or underdogs winning respect by beating the best... have been wanting to be different by having a surprising end, such as Million Dollar Baby. They know if the hero wins at last, as usual, the audience will be bored. So they tried to make some change. But no matter how the change happens, the hero wins in his way, and the movie is still made to motivate people. The wrestler, on surface a movie to motivate people to never give up on themselves even if you are too old or too ill, but deeply, it's very sad; it is a movie about self-redemption through self-destruction. The Ram is literally a man with nothing to lose. He struggles to find his normal life back(if he ever had one), but in his attempt he finds no one needs him, and he, in despair, turns to wrestling again, because there are the people who need him. He doesn't go back pick up wrestling again because he wanna have the showdown with his old rival; he goes back, because there is no other way to go. If he could lead a normal life he wouldn't have chosen to go back for he knows very well that he may die if he wrestles again.So here is what he says: I just want to say to you all tonight I'm very grateful to be here. A lot of people told me that I'd never wrestle again and that's all I do. You know, if you live hard and play hard and you burn the candle at both ends, you pay the price for it. You know in this life you can loose everything you love, everything that loves you. Now I don't hear as good as I used to and I forget stuff and I ain't as pretty as I used to be but god damn it I'm still standing here and I'm The Ram. As times goes by, as times goes by, they say 'he's washed up', 'he's finished' , 'he's a loser', 'he's all through'. You know what? The only one that's going to tell me when I'm through doing my thing is you people here.And he knows this is self-destruction...... and self-redemption.",10,1,2,9 February 2009
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Sometimes movies don't need to convey any meaning or message to shine!
","I remember when I for the first time saw the Chinese title of Vicky Cristina Barcelona(translated as Midnight Barcelona), I was thoroughly touched---yet hadn't seen it; normally if the title is this intoxicating, you probably can count on the movie to be accordingly beautiful, plus Woody being the director, I looked forward to seeing it impatiently.It turned out to be nice enough to glue me on my chair when I saw it at a very late night. It's very fun and relaxing movie, with charming actors and music. I enjoyed seeing it. Afterwards I asked myself why I like Vicky Cristina Barcelona this much, and the answer, satisfactorily, is that there is no obvious meaning or message it tries to convey.Well, there are a lot of films that contain deep and serious meaning and messages, in the theme or in the camera-directing. Those films are indeed enlightening and they are sort of like our teachers, from whom we learn to live in our world. Yet there are other films that bring us pure fun and in the same process let us relax.Pure fun is very often in little things.Vicky Cristina Barcelona is quite little...you guys know what I mean don't you... The whole movie is like the music in it, friendly, delicate, relaxing, yet very sexy, and seeing a movie like it is pure fun. You don't have to think hard to pick up all the fragmentary threads to get the great idea, and you won't be completely shocked and feel ashamed to be human. Watching Vicky Cristina Barcelona, all you need to do is get yourself in a comfortable sofa, try to experience with the characters the beauty of Spain and its art, feel the actors' charm, laugh when the fun comes, smile when you find you can identify with them, move your body with the end music and plan on seeing Barcelona with your own eyes. What is left when you finish seeing it will be your smile and a refreshed body.",8,6,11,13 February 2009
Slumdog Millionaire," Oh! Poor Danny, not again...
","Please, please tell me why so many of you people love this piece of crap?! It will probably take my entire life to figure it out! I'm gonna tell you the reason why I still gave it a 4. It's the ambition, the ambition of Danny to make a different movie, which is obvious if only you see half of the movie. The difference lies in the storytelling. A boy reveals his life by explaining to the suspicious policemen why he, an uneducated slumdog boy, managed to win amazingly great money that no one ever did in the history of the program Who Wanna Be The Millionaire. Deservedly it is great storytelling. Yet a great storytelling alone is never enough to make a great movie.Remember the excitement we had after we saw Pulp Fiction? Was the excitement purely out of the outstanding storytelling? Certainly not, we love the storytelling because it is combined with shining acting, fascinating music, deep ideas, and solid ending. The storytelling is just a skeleton, and the other things make the flesh. How beautiful can a great skeleton be if there is little decent flesh on it? Pulp Fiction is strong both inside and outside, however, Slumdog Millionaire, just has a nice outside.Before I saw Slumdog Millionaire, many people told me it is the Indian version of City Of God, and I felt even more excited when I found its director is Danny. But after I saw it, I was completely disappointed. Because Danny did the stupid thing again! After his greatest movie Trainspotting, this guy seemed have turned to someone nobody can recognize. Look at 28 days later, it could have been a milestone if he had added a unique idea for it; The Beach, great acting and story, but the ending, so so disgustingly stupid... You will easily fall in love with these two movies if you see the first half only... Why Danny, why always lack a little bit to be great? Slumdog Millionaire has the same and new problems. The end is as meaningless as The Beach; the lack of ideas is inherited from 28 Days Later. And the new problems this time are terrible! The music is sick; the whole plot is very very far-fetched and unnatural: how did the two characters fall in love; this is a movie talking about things in India, and it is honorably compared with City Of God because they are both about the crime and violence in the worst places of the world(India and Brazil), however, if you wanna introduce something violent and horrifying, you should do it in a violent and horrifying way. So many people that like this movie say Slumdog Millionaire is the City Of God without blood. That just doesn't make any sense! If there is no blood, it's not India at all!!!I almost lost my faith in Oscar when I saw it gave so many nominations to Slumdog Millionaire but not The Dark Knight and The Wrestler... They are truly solid movies.",4,6,9,9 February 2009
