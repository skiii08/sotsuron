The King's Speech," Solid historical drama
","The King's Speech (2010) directed by Tom Hooper, has won acclaim as one of the best films of the year. As everyone knows by now, it's the story of a speech pathologist who helps King George VI become the wartime orator that England needed. Colin Firth is outstanding as King George VI, Helena Bonham Carter is wonderful as Queen Elizabeth, and Geoffrey Rush is equally good as Lionel Logue, the speech teacher.You can't help but enjoy this film, because it's about decent people trying to cope with a truly serious problem. (No one who stutters is happy to have this affliction, but a king who can't make a speech as his country is preparing for war is in serious trouble.)As with all historical dramas, we know the end of this one as soon as the movie begins. Still, the director works with his fine actors to make us care about the process of getting to where we know we will be as the credits start to roll. Definitely a film worth seeing. We saw it on the large screen, but it should work equally well on DVD.",8,0,0,6 March 2011
Black Swan," A Minority Opinion
","Black Swan (2010), directed by Darren Aronofsky, has an IMDb rank within the 100 highest-scoring films ever made. It's hard to argue with that kind of success, but I wasn't that impressed by the movie. The plot itself is standard ballet fare--beautiful principal dancer, aging dancer being forced to retire, 'friend' who is anything but, cruel but talented director, smothering mother who never got past the corps in her own career. What else is new?The film alternates between reality and hallucination, and often we can't tell which we're seeing. Serious mental illness is treated as just another part of the tense, competitive ballet world. If you are actively hallucinating, you need medical help. Audience applause won't do it.I think part of the film's critical success is based on Natalie Portman's beauty. The image of Portman in her Black Swan makeup--used for the movie's poster--has already become iconic. Portman is a fine actor. So are Mila Kunis, Vincent Cassel, and Barbara Hershey. They're all good actors in a good movie. So, Black Swan is worth seeing. However, in my opinion, it shouldn't rank 61st in the list of the greatest movies of all time.",7,1,3,20 February 2011
Lucky Number Slevin," It's OK if you like that sort of thing
","Lucky Number Slevin (2006), directed by Paul McGuigan, is a crime movie where nothing is what it seems to be. Josh Hartnett plays Slevin Kelevra, who gets off a bus, gets mugged, ends up at a friend's apartment, meets Lindsey (Lucy Liu), and gets kidnapped. That all happens in the first ten minutes of the film, so none of this constitutes a spoiler. As the movie progresses, we're introduced to Morgan Freeman as The Boss, Sir Ben Kingsley as the Rabbi, and Bruce Willis as the professional assassin, Mr. Goodkat. Most of the movie involves people thinking that Slevin is someone else, demanding money from Slevin, threatening his life, and punching him in the stomach to emphasize the seriousness of their demands. Slevin responds with James Bond-like quips. Lucy Liu's character is--I believe--described as a 'coroner.' I think they mean that she's a pathologist, although I don't think she'd be living in her modest apartment if she were an M.D. Anyway, she's as cute and witty as can be, so no one notices or cares.The film didn't deliver much, considering the star power invested in it. Still, it wasn't boring, the acting was professional, and it worked well on the small screen. It's OK if you like that sort of thing.",7,0,1,29 January 2008
The Young Victoria," A love story that happens to be true.
","The Young Victoria (2009) directed by Jean-Marc Vallée, is a love story between a young woman and a young man. What makes it an interesting movie is that the young woman happens to be the Queen of England. The love story between Queen Victoria and Prince Albert has been told many times. This particular account of their romance succeeds because of several factors. It has great production values, it has reasonable historical accuracy, and it has Emily Blunt as Victoria. The production values are what we expect from a BBC-style historical drama. It's impossible to deny the pleasure of watching actors wearing period costumes as they move through great English manor houses and castles.Experts in Victoriana point out lapses in historical details, but, as far as I can tell, the main historical aspects of the film are accurate. More importantly, the plot goes beyond politics to emphasize the stultifying atmosphere in which Victoria was raised. Until she reaches her majority, her life is ruled by her overbearing mother. The fact that Victoria survived this upbringing with her psyche more or less unscathed is a testament to her psychological resilience. This makes the story more than simply a historical drama.Emily Blunt is perfect as the young Victoria. Her attractive features are enhanced by her flawless, glowing complexion. She does, indeed, bear a likeness to portraits of Queen Victoria as a young woman, and she is as convincing in her role as Helen Mirren was as Queen Elizabeth II.This movie is worth seeing as a love story and as a study of the psychological attributes of a young woman whose circumstances have made her a queen. It will lose something on a small screen, but it's worth seeking out on DVD if unavailable in a theater.P.S. A special exhibition of art collected by, and portraying, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert will be shown at the Queen's Gallery in London through October 31, 2010.",9,2,2,5 April 2010
Finding Neverland," Minority opinion
","Finding Neverland (2004), directed by Marc Forster, has received high scores and rave reviews on IMDb. This review represents a minority opinion. I found the movie shallow, the acting mediocre, and the ending obvious.The one strong aspect of the film has been noted by an earlier reviewer--it allows a glimpse into the mind of a creative artist. JM Barrie takes bits and pieces from real life, and turns them into Peter Pan. Interesting, but let's remember that what he created wasn't exactly King Lear.Johnny Depp has great cheekbones, Kate Winslet suffers beautifully, and Julie Christie demonstrates that true beauty is independent of age. Dustin Hoffman, as Barrie's long-suffering producer, was the only actor for whom I would have wished more screen time. The child actors were adequate, but then so was the dog.I think this movie is too mature for children, too childish for adults, and not right for anyone. Don't say you weren't warned!",6,1,4,28 December 2004
In Bruges," A fairy tale about a fairy-tale city
","In Bruges (2008), written and directed by Martin McDonagh, stars Colin Farrell as Ray and Brendan Gleeson as Ken. These two professional killers have been sent to Bruges to lie low after a killing-gone-wrong. Their boss is Harry, played by Ralph Fiennes, who follows their progress by phone from England.Ray is hyperactive, depressed, and hates Bruges. Ken can actually enjoy the wonders of Bruges, even though it's just a stop on the road to the next killing. Clémence Poésy is Chloë, a woman who hangs around movie sets to deal drugs and offer her body as enticement to the unwary. I've been to Bruges twice, and it's probably the most enchanting city I've ever seen. It's called the Sleeping Beauty city because progress passed it by, and there was no incentive to tear down the old and build the new. By the time people got around to modernizing Bruges, they understood the value of a city preserved as if in amber, and they left it the way it was. (You actually get a pretty good tour of Bruges in the movie, and it looks beautiful. That's the point--it's a beautiful city in which terrible things are happening.)The terrible things naturally involve Ray, Ken, Harry, Chloë, and other lowlife types as well. What makes the story a fairy tale is that all kinds of mayhem take place on the streets and in the houses of Bruges, and no one except the main characters appears to notice. People shoot at each other, coins rain down from a tower, and a police officer never appears. Bruges has police, and they intervene there as they would intervene anywhere else. You have to suspend disbelief to accept their absence in the film.Despite this lack of realism, the movie is both a powerful psychological study and a real thriller. It's definitely worth seeking out in a theater, and will work fairly well on the small screen as well. See it!",9,0,2,20 April 2008
The Big Lebowski," The highest rated movie that I actively disliked.
","The Big Lebowski (1998) was written and directed by the Coen Brothers.It features some great actors: Jeff Bridges, John Goodman, Julianne Moore, Steve Buscemi and Philip Seymour Hoffman. However, in my opinion, their talents are wasted in this film.It's about getting high, getting hit, and getting out. Maybe it would work better if you watched it when you were stoned.This film has an amazing IMDb rating of 8.1. Everyone liked it, even the top thousand reviewers who rarely like any movie. I gave it a 3.0. It's one of those films where I say, 'Did those people see the same movie I saw?'The Big Lebowski is considered a cult classic, and you can't say you know movies until you've watched it at least once. In my opinion, once is more than enough. It's a loser.",3,4,9,22 August 2019
42," Solid film biopic of a truly great man
","42 (2013) was written and directed by Brian Helgeland. It tells the story of Jackie Robinson, the first Black baseball player to play on a major league team.I grew up in Brooklyn, and we kids thought of the Dodgers almost as members of our family. I watched Jackie Robinson play in Ebbets Field many times. Chadwick Boseman, the actor who portrays Jackie Robinson, looks like Robinson, and has imitated his style on the base paths perfectly. This is the film to see if you want to know what the game of baseball looked like in the late 1940's into the mid 1950's. (Of course, it looked predominantly White, although other Black players soon followed Robinson into the majors.) Both Harrison Ford as Branch Rickey, and Nicole Beharie as Rachel Robinson give solid acting performances. However, a movie like this rises or falls on the abilities of the star. Boseman has great abilities, and he makes the movie work.This is an excellent movie to watch with your children or grandchildren. They will find it hard to believe that African-Americans weren't allowed to play major league baseball. It's a great way to bring the segregated universe of the mid-20th Century to their attention. It's also a great way to show them that the right person, at the right time, can bring about a true change in society.P.S. We kids had no problem at all with a Black player on the Dodgers. All we cared about was winning the pennant and the World Series. We knew that Robinson could help the Dodgers win, and winning was what we wanted!",9,1,2,30 August 2017
The Other Boleyn Girl," Six wives and a mistress
","'The Other Boleyn Girl' (2008) was directed by Justin Chadwick. It stars Natalie Portman as Anne Boleyn, and Scarlett Johansson as her sister, Mary Boleyn. As everyone knows, Henry VIII broke with the Roman Catholic church in order to divorce his first wife, Katherine of Aragon, and marry Anne Boleyn. We all know what happened to Anne when she failed to produce a son and heir. What many of us don't know--but is apparently true--is that Henry fathered a son by Anne's sister Mary. Because this child was born out of wedlock, and because Henry assumed he would have a legitimate male heir, he didn't acknowledge the child. The relationship between the king and the two sisters is at the center of the film.The film doesn't adhere to a strict timeline. For example, Anne Boleyn spent most of her early life in the royal households of the Netherlands and France. In the film, she is sent to France as a punishment, and almost immediately recalled. However, the basic facts- - that Mary Boleyn was Henry's mistress and that Anne Boleyn refused to become his mistress, but became his wife--are correct. The acting is excellent, and the casting choices are outstanding. (Some people have written that the two sisters are cast against type, but I don't agree. Johansson, with her blonde hair and open expression, is perfect for Mary, who is portrayed as naive and trusting. Portman's exotic dark beauty is ideal for Anne, who is manipulative and ambitious.) Eric Bana does well as Henry Tudor, but three of the supporting actors are truly excellent-- David Morrissey as the amoral Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, Kristin Scott Thomas as the girls' mother, Lady Elizabeth Boleyn, and Ana Torrent as Katherine of Aragon, Henry's first wife. If you hate costume dramas, stay away from this film. If you enjoy movies with great castles, magnificent horses, gorgeous costumes, handsome men and beautiful women, 'The Other Boleyn Girl' delivers all of these things. We saw the movie on a large, flat-screen TV. It would work better in a theater, and would lose some of its grandeur with DVD on a standard television screen. Still, whatever the format, I think it's good enough to be worth finding and seeing.",8,0,0,8 August 2008
The Danish Girl," This movie is much better than its rating would indicate.
","The Danish Girl (2015) was directed by Tom Hooper. This film is loosely based on the life of Einar Wegener (Eddie Redmayne), a Danish artist who realized that he was a woman trapped in a man's body. That's not a strange concept now, but in the 1920's it was considered not only strange, but psychotic. Eventually, Einar becomes Lili Elbe, and she considers having the pioneering surgery for a sex-role change. Again, hardly shocking now, but the surgery had never been performed before.Alicia Vikander plays Einar's wife, Gerda Wegener, who is naturally confused and horrified as her husband turns into Lili. After a while, she accepts that her husband really is Lili. In fact, Gerda supports Lili through this extraordinarily challenging time, Both of the lead actors do superb work. The film would fail without two solid performances in these two parts. In addition, the remainder of the cast is excellent. The film is filled with gorgeous images of Copenhagen, Paris, and Dresden. That positive aspect of the movie is also a negative aspect. Director Hooper wants us to know where we are. So, when we are in Copenhagen, we get endless views of the waterfront market. The women at the market stalls all wear hats made of folded newspaper. After the sixth or seventh establishing shot, I wanted to call out, 'OK--we understand. Market. Hats. This is Copenhagen.' When we get to Paris, Hooper actually makes sure that we see the Eiffel Tower. 'OK--got it. This is Paris.' He doesn't do as well with Dresden. Still, there's on market and no Eiffel Tower, so it had to be Dresden.As I write this review 'The Danish Girl' has an abysmal IMDb rating of 6.4. Almost as many people rated it '1' as rated it '10.' It's a much better film than 6.4. My guess is that some of the people who gave it a low rating did so because they are uncomfortable with the depiction of transgender people. My suggestion to you--find 'The Danish Girl' and watch it. Don't let the low rating cause you to miss this important movie.We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It should work almost as well on the small screen.",Null,1,6,5 January 2016
Elizabeth," She was meant to be queen!
","Elizabeth (1998), directed by Shekhar Kapur, was the film that made Cate Blanchett a star. Elizabeth I has been portrayed by many fine actors, and, of course, Blanchett has portrayed her again in a newly released film. Whether Blanchett is or isn't the best movie Elizabeth is not the point. The point is that she fully inhabits the character, so that it requires no suspension of disbelief to accept Blanchett as the young queen, fighting for her crown and fighting for her life. I can't pretend to know whether the costumes and sets are accurate reflections of Elizabethan England. However, they certainly appear realistic, as do the (very unpleasant) scenes of martyrdom and torture. Unlike 'Shakespeare in Love,' this movie doesn't give us endless glimpses of dogs, pigs, street entertainers, etc. (In our family, we say 'Cue the jugglers.') The film deals with nobility, and their lives were lived in their castles or at the royal court, not on the streets.The supporting actors are outstanding--especially Fanny Ardant as Mary of Guise, the mother of Mary, Queen of Scots, Christopher Eccleston as the powerful and ambitious Duke of Norfolk, and Geoffrey Rush as Sir Francis Walsingham, who will stop at nothing to serve his queen. I was less impressed by Joseph Fiennes as Elizabeth's love interest, Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester. I don't know how the historical Dudley looked and acted, but Fiennes looked both hostile and tentative throughout the film.The core of the drama is, of course, Elizabeth, and Cate Blanchett performs the role to perfection. We can believe her as a frivolous adolescent, as a ruler finding her way, and as the more mature historical Elizabeth, who created a role and then played that role for the rest of her reign. Even if you don't like historical dramas, it's worth seeing this film just to watch Cate Blanchett act. You can ignore Leicester, Norfolk, and the Duke of Anjou. Just look at Elizabeth!",10,0,2,5 January 2008
Black Book," Grim movie about a grim topic
","The Dutch movie Zwartboek was shown in the U.S. with the translated title Black Book (2006). It was co-written and directed by Paul Verhoeven.The movie shows us the ghastly treatment of Dutch Jews--and, in fact Dutch people in general--during the German occupation of Holland. Rachel Stein--who changes her name to Ellis de Vries--is a Jewish woman who survives the Holocaust and emigrates to Israel. (We know that she survives because the first scene of the film begins with Rachel teaching an elementary class in a kibbutz in Israel. The rest of the movie is shown as Rachel's flashback.)The plot tells us how she survived, and how she was able to help the Dutch resistance movement as they tried to free their country from the Germans. The movie is extremely convoluted. It's also incredibly violent. It's definitely not for the faint of heart.The film works because Carice van Houten is so convincing as Rachel Stein/Ellis de Vries. Of course, she's very beautiful, but she's also a great actor. Her beauty enables her to infiltrate the German headquarters, and her intelligence allows her to survive, even though betrayal is everywhere.The film is long, very sexual, and, as I stated, very violent. If that's the type of film you like, don't miss The Black Book. This really isn't my kind of movie, so I gave it a rating of 7. However, the overall IMDb rating is 7.8, so other reviewers like it better than I did. We saw the film on DVD, where it worked well. We watched it straight through. However, it's 2 1/2 hours long, so you could watch half of it one day, and the other half the next.",7,0,0,30 December 2016
Brokeback Mountain," Of Mice and Men revisited
","Brokeback Mountain (2005), directed by Ang Lee, is based on a New Yorker short story by E. Annie Proulx, and has a screenplay by Larry McMurtry. Although Lee is Chinese, he appears to have a good feel for the western U.S., and, of course, both Proulx and McMurtry have demonstrated their expertise in portraying this region.The story is well known to everyone--two young men have a same-sex love relationship that persists after each has a wife and children. The point of the story is that this love is difficult to display in the best of circumstances, and impossible to display in their circumstances.The problem with this film for me is that the only memorable aspect of both men is their love for each other. Other than their hidden love, they don't demonstrate any positive characteristics--intelligence, honesty, or kindness. Each man makes his wife unhappy, and neither is a satisfactory parent.The tragedy of this film is that two lives that could have been happy are robbed of the possibility of happiness. This reflects a societal problem that I consider a disgrace. Moreover, their unhappiness causes unhappiness in others that spreads out in a ripple effect. One problem for me is that I thought the film was uncharitable to both wives. The film presented them as obstacles to happiness, while I thought they should have been considered as victims of the same forces to which their husbands were subjected. (Incidentally, Michelle Williams was outstanding in the thankless role as one of the wives.)Brokeback Mountain is an important movie about an important theme. However, I would have enjoyed this film more if it had been about characters for whom I had more affection.",7,0,20,8 July 2006
Spotlight," A movie that needs to be seen!
","Spotlight (2015/I) was co-written and directed by Tom McCarthy. In the 70's, 80's, and into the 90's, 'everyone knew' that some priests were sexually abusing children. However, no major newspaper had had the courage and/or the staff to bring the story to light.By sheer determination, combined with investigative excellence, in 1992, the Boston Globe published a factual, detailed expose of the behavior of the rogue priests, and the cover-up of these abuses by high-ranking church officials.Remember that this was in Boston, where the main ethnic roots are Italian and Irish. Attacking the Catholic Church on what is basically its home turf wasn't easy, and it wasn't fun. However, publishing that story brought many people to the realization that they were dealing with a highly flawed institution. Also, those flaws of abuse and cover-up were nation-wide, not just in Boston. (And, as it turned out, not just in the U.S.) The Boston Globe won the Pulitzer price for reporting, and it was richly deserved.This movie gives you the feel of a nuts-and-bolts investigation. Blocked avenues that must be circumvented or somehow opened; dealing with people who were damaged by the abuse; working against the power of the church and its supporters; working with people who should be helpful, but who have their own agenda.The cast includes many fine actors: Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel McAdams, Stanley Tucci, and Billy Crudup. It's an ensemble movie--each reporter has a distinct personality, as do the lawyers, the churchmen, and the victims.As I write this review, Spotlight has an overall 8.6 rating, which is extraordinarily high. Believe the rating--it's a great film.P.S. I hope everyone reading this review who lives in or near Rochester, NY, recognizes the quality of the films shown at The Little Theatre, on East Avenue. Right now The Little is screening Suffragette, Trumbo, Spotlight, and Brooklyn. (Also Macbeth, which we haven't yet seen.) If you love movies, and you're not a member of The Little, you should be!",10,7,13,11 December 2015
500 Days of Summer," What movie did everyone else see?
","(500) Days of Summer (2009), directed by Marc Webb, is riding a wave of viewer adoration. Right now, it's listed in the IMDb top 250 films of all time (113th). All I can assume is that the people who gave the film a 9 or a 10 saw a different movie from the one I viewed in Rochester's Little Theatre.What I saw is a man, Tom Hansen, portrayed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who is madly, truly in love with Summer Finn, played by Zooey Deschanel. OK--Deschanel has big, beautiful blue eyes, and lustrous dark hair. Right--very attractive. Is she intelligent? Not very. Is she kind and caring? Not very. Is she compassionate? Not very. Is she attracted to Tom? Not very.So, we're subjected to 90 minutes of Summer jumping into bed with Tom, all the while telling him that she just wants to be good friends. I guess that's sort of romantic, and it's sort of funny, so technically that makes 500 Days a romantic comedy. It's just not very romantic or very funny.In addition, just to bring the hilarity to a boil, we get Tom's friends, who are a Greek chorus of losers, and Tom's precocious kid sister, who dispenses worldly wisdom in spare moments while she's playing for her junior varsity soccer team.My suggestion--if you want a really good romantic comedy, rent 'Must Like Dogs,' or 'Sleepless in Seattle.' If you like funny, romantic movies, stay away from '500 Days of Summer.' (At least, stay away from the version of the movie that I saw in Rochester.)",6,3,7,1 September 2009
Juno," The pregnancy test is positive. Now what?
","Juno (2007) was directed by Jason Reitman, and stars Ellen Page as Juno MacGuff. As the movie opens, 16-year-old Juno is trying her third pregnancy test. When it's positive, she has to make decisions that will obviously have a bearing on how she lives the rest of her life. Michael Cera plays Paulie Bleeker, the baby's father. Allison Janney is great in the supporting role of Juno's stepmother. (Juno and her stepmother don't hate each other, but they don't exactly have a warm and cozy relationship either.) Jennifer Garner plays the impossibly elegant--and somewhat compulsive--Vanessa, who desperately wants a baby, but can't conceive. Jason Bateman is her husband. He's eager enough about adopting, but he's drawn to Juno in a definitely unhealthy way.This isn't exactly a feel-good movie. It's not really a teen movie, a feminist movie, or an anti-feminist movie either. It floats close to all those genres, but doesn't fit any of them. The ending comes down the way life often comes down--not perfect, but not so bad either.We saw this film in a theater, but it will work on DVD. P.S. Be sure not to miss the writing on the note Juno leaves for Vanessa. It's framed and hanging on the wall in Vanessa's home. The note is less than ten words long, but it tells it all.",8,1,6,29 January 2008
Match Point," Sometimes having everything isn't good enough
","Match Point (2005), written and directed by Woody Allen, is a movie during which I wanted to shout, 'Don't do it' to the protagonist.Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) was a modestly skilled professional tennis player who now has everything: an intelligent, beautiful, loving wife (the exquisite Emily Mortimer), a great job (his boss is his father-in-law), good looks, charm, and what appears to be the best apartment in London.What Chris doesn't have--but decides he wants--is Nola Rice (played by Scarlett Johansson). Nola--a no-talent aspiring actress from the U.S.--describes herself as sexy, but not beautiful. Well, actually, she's both, but that's about the end of her list of positive attributes.Chris risks everything to begin an affair with Nola, with predictable results, up to a point. About 90 minutes into this two-hour film, Allen switches course, and the last quarter of the film doesn't really fit the first three quarters. I found this annoying, although I can't deny that the action leading to the film's conclusion is riveting.The actors are excellent, with the exception of Johansson, who to my mind plays the part with no particular insight or subtlety.London looks wonderful--clean and brilliant. (Allen's London bears the same resemblance to the real London as Allen's New York does to the real New York.) The soundtrack--mostly classic operatic performances--is wonderful.This is a film worth seeing, but I suggest you see it at home. That way, when Chris approaches Nola, you can shout, 'Don't do it' without disturbing the other people in the theater.",8,0,0,22 January 2006
Midnight in Paris," Strengths and weaknesses
","Midnight in Paris (2011) was written and directed by Woody Allen. The bad news about this movie is that the 'real' plot is ridiculous. We are supposed to believe that Gil (played by Owen Wilson) would want to marry Inez (Rachel McAdams) despite the fact that Inez is spoiled, selfish, immature, and comes as part of a package that includes her unpleasant parents and obnoxious friends. Yes, Inez is attractive, but as a successful screenwriter, surely Gil could find other attractive women with whom he'd be more compatible.The other part of the 'real' plot that doesn't compute is that Gil, a handsome, strapping, Californian, would be channeling Woody Allen's nebbish character. When Gil whines, 'That's crazy,' in Allen's singsong voice, I just wanted to wince.The good news is that the 'fantasy' part of the plot is great. Allen knows how to present cities to us in the best possible light (in both senses). Paris looks wonderful, the people in it look wonderful, and the 'conceit' of going back in time worked for me.So, I recommend that you see this movie, ignore the 'real' plot, and concentrate on Paris in an earlier era. As with most Woody Allen movies, this film will work on a small screen.",7,3,5,12 July 2011
Hotel Rwanda," Probably the most important movie of 2004
","Hotel Rwanda (2004) Directed by Terry George, is the great film of 2004.Don Cheadle plays Paul Rusesabagina, an African who has bought into the European ideal of the perfect life. He's the manager of a four-star hotel in Rwanda. He has a beautiful wife (played by Sophie Okonedo), handsome and healthy young children, a new vehicle, and a fine suburban home.All this changes when civil strife erupts in Rwanda. When this happens the former colonial powers wash their hands of the problems, and the Rwandans are left to fend for themselves in an atmosphere of increasing violence and anarchy.The acting is excellent and the story is emotionally gripping. Like Schindler's List, the film follows one man's attempt to save as many people as he can. Schindler and Rusesabagina were heroic, resourceful, and amazingly effective. However, as individuals, they could accomplish only so much. Outside intervention could have saved a million lives in Rwanda, but it was never forthcoming. The Rwandan genocide is one of the great tragedies of the 20th century. Hotel Rwanda brings this horror onto the screen and into our lives.Addendum: Nick Nolte plays Colonel Oliver, the U.N. commander in Rwanda. This role is obviously based on Lieutenant General Romeo Dallaire, the Canadian officer who commanded the ridiculously small force of 400 U.N. soldiers. These troops were unable to do anything more than watch the genocide taking place before their eyes. General Dellaire's story is told in Steven Silver's film 'The Last Just Man.'",10,11,16,5 February 2005
Once," Meant for each other
","'Once' (2006) was written and directed by John Carney. The film, set in Dublin, is a love story. However, we know that 'the course of true love never did run smooth.'Glen Hansard plays a street musician. (His day job is repairing vacuum cleaners.) Markéta Irglová plays a Czech immigrant who sells magazines and flowers on the street. (Her day job is cleaning houses.) Naturally enough, they meet, and there's a definite chemistry between them. There's a definite chemistry between their music as well. It turns out that the young woman is an accomplished pianist and singer. Together, they really do make beautiful music.Naturally, problems arise. Both people have previous attachments. The plot of the movie is concerned with the way they work out their lives in view of their circumstances and their commitments.Director Carney does a solid job of introducing us to the realities of earning a living as a street busker. The entire film has an authentic, realistic feel to it. Markéta Irglová is a fine musician, and turns out to be an excellent actor as well. (This is her first film.) Carney picked bravely and well when he chose Irglová. She's attractive, but not in the supermodel style of Paulina Porizkova. Irglová looks like the character she portrays--someone who may be selling flowers on the street, but who is a talented and sensitive musician at heart.",9,2,4,8 July 2007
Pan's Labyrinth," A strong, disturbing movie
","'El Laberinto del Fauno' (2006) was written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. (The film was shown in the U.S. with the title, 'Pan's Labyrinth.')This extraordinary film combines frightening reality with the equally frightening internal world of a a young girl. Ivana Baquero plays Ofelia, the gentle, quiet, step-daughter of a Fascist army captain. Sergi López portrays Capitán Vidal as the ideal Fascist officer. He is brave, cruel, gives blind obedience to his superiors, and expects blind obedience from his subordinates. Ofelia and her mother are virtual captives of the captain in an isolated military outpost. In 1944, partisans in the mountains were still opposing Franco's forces, and it's the captain's job to wipe them out by any means at his disposal. This includes the torture of prisoners to make them reveal the person inside the military compound who is aiding the guerrillas. (We don't see the actual torture, but we see the physical results that follow it, and those scenes are gruesome.)Faced with this horror, Ofelia is drawn into another world, which is also not a paradise. It's a dangerous environment, into which she must venture to help her mother and to achieve her destiny as a magical princess.The cast of the movie is outstanding. Both Baquero and López are excellent. Álex Angulo is wonderful as Dr. Ferreiro, who must weigh the ethics of his profession against the demands placed upon him by Captain Vidal.The performance by Maribel Verdú as Mercedes, the captain's housekeeper, is extraordinary. It's wonderful to see a glamorous young movie star transform herself into a working-class servant, who is beneath the notice of her employer.This is a hard and demanding film. The grimness of the situation is present in all the scenes, with hardly any happiness or hope to offset it. Nonetheless, it's an important film, and definitely worth seeking out and watching.",9,1,4,12 February 2007
Begin Again," Not exactly boy meets girl, but sort of like that
","Begin Again (2013/II) was written and directed by John Carney, It's a movie with a fairly basic plot--struggling, formerly great music producer (Dan, played by Mark Ruffalo), meets young, inexperienced singer-songwriter (Gretta, played by Keira Knightley) and the magic begins.What makes this more than just another summer movie is the great acting--from the two leads, and also from Hailee Steinfeld as Violet, Dan's daughter, and Catherine Keener as Miriam, Dan's estranged wife. Also, I've never understood what a record's producer brought to the team. Here, it was clear to me that Dan could listen to a young singer playing her guitar, and hear in his head what she would sound like with full musical accompaniment. That's a talent that he had, and others didn't.Another highlight for me was the concept of avoiding the cost of a studio by recording an album outdoors in various locations across New York City. It's one of those ideas where you say, 'It's so crazy, it just might work.'We saw this film on the large screen at the Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. It probably will work better on a large screen than on DVD. However, it's worth seeing, so if it's not playing locally, watch it any way you can. It's not a magical movie, but it's much better than most movies, and you'll be glad that you saw it.",8,1,3,16 August 2014
The Book Thief," An amazing film, narrated by Death
","The Book Thief (2013) was directed by Brian Percival. It's an unusual movie in which Death is the narrator. In Death Takes a Holiday (1934) The Seventh Seal (1957), and Black Orpheus (1959) death is an on-screen character. However, in this case, we see the film from Death's point of view.Sophie Nélisse portrays Liesel Meminger, whose mother is taken by the Nazis because she's a Communist. Liesel isn't Jewish, so she's not sent to a concentration camp. Instead, she is placed in the home of Hans and Rosa Hubermann. (Portrayed by Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson.) They aren't the happiest of couples, but they protect and care for Liesel.Telling much more about the plot wouldn't be right for this movie. Needless to say, the world turns upside down for all of the lead characters. It's hard to act in a way that even resembles normal in this horrible, abnormal period.The direction is excellent, and Sophie Nélisse was already a superb actor at the age of 13, when the movie was produced. (She has gone on to star in many movies since 2013.)We watched this film on the small screen, where it worked well. The Book Thief has an excellent 7.6 rating. I think it's even better than that.",9,0,0,24 December 2019
Lost in Translation," 'Songs of love, but not for me!'
","'Lost in Translation,' is one of those movies that has received high critical acclaim. We went to see it on the basis of the impressive 8.2 weighted rating on IMDb. After seeing 'Lost in Translation,' my thought is, 'What movie did everyone else see?' We are presented with the situation of two presumably lost souls, searching for meaning in their lives. Bob Harris (Bill Murray), is being paid $2 million to spend a few hours making a Japanese whiskey commercial. Bob--take the money and run.You're never going to play Macbeth. (Neither are you, Bill.) We are also meant to have sympathy for Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). Let's get this straight--you are young, beautiful, intelligent, an Ivy League graduate, staying in a luxury hotel in one of the world's great cities. Why are you sad? Poor thing--you took your degree in Philosophy and it never occurred to you that you'd need a PhD to teach the subject? Your husband is a jerk? (OK--he's a jerk. No one made you study Philosophy, and no one made you marry the jerk, and no one's making you stay with the jerk you married.)My advice to Charlotte--stop with the angst and leave Bill Murray alone. Go home, get a divorce, go back to college, study law, social work, or education. Get a degree, get a job, get a life.My advice to movie buffs--stay away from 'Lost in Translation.' Rent 'Roman Holiday' instead. It will be obvious that Bill Murray isn't Gregory Peck, Scarlett Johansson isn't Audrey Hepburn, and Sofia Coppola isn't William Wyler. Why accept a weak substitute if you can watch the same plot in a great movie?",5,1,2,27 September 2003
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Three Billboards--by now you know it's a great film
","Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri (2017) was written and directed by Martin McDonagh. By now, most people have either seen the movie or heard quite a bit about it. It's strange to write the 641st review. However, here it is.If you want to see a great actor in a great movie, watch Frances McDormand in this film. Co-stars Woody Harrelson and Sam Rockwell do very well, but McDormand is perfect.Scriptwriter McDonagh has given McDormand the demanding role of a mother whose daughter has been raped and murdered. McDormand is angry, and she's also guilty. That is a powerful recipe for action. McDormand isn't a likable character, but you can understand her rage and her pain.This is a brilliant film and deserves all the positive reviews and awards that it has received.This is a movie that you don't want to miss. We saw it at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. It will work almost as well on the small screen. Once you've seen it, you'll never forget it.",10,1,4,15 March 2018
The Devil Wears Prada," Meryl Streep can do no wrong!
","The Devil Wears Prada (2006) was directed by David Frankel. This is a movie about the fashion industry. In it we learn that, in fashion, it's better to be thin than not to be thin, people pretend to like each other when they don't, people with power and prestige tend to exercise their power and prestige, and people betray their friends if such betrayal will help them obtain or retain power. Shocking, truly shocking!Please don't see this film for the plot. The movie requires a true suspension of disbelief. We're asked to believe that an honors graduate of Northwestern University goes for a job interview at a fashion magazine and doesn't know the name of the magazine's editor. It doesn't occur to her to dress up, rather than dress down, for the interview. She chooses an onion bagel for breakfast. (All of that is just in the first five minutes of the movie.)We also have to believe that Anne Hathaway is frumpy and dowdy before she learns about fashion at her new job. Makeup and costuming did their best, but Anne Hathaway is Anne Hathaway, and she's drop-dead beautiful even before someone gives her high heels and designer dresses.So--why see the movie? Three reasons--the fashions really are great; Paris looks wonderful; and Meryl Streep can do no wrong. Streep plays Miranda Priestly--demonic in her intensity and her demands, never looking anything other than her best, and contemptuous of anyone who doesn't recognize that the fashion industry is the center of the Universe. That portrayal doesn't require us to have any suspension of disbelief whatever. Streep has the talent to make you believe in her character, and the physical presence to stand out in a room filled with supermodels. Streep can inhabit a character so completely that it's hard to believe that, when the filming is over, she's really Meryl Streep and not the character she plays.This is a movie worth seeing, as long as you don't expect to leave the theater with a new and profound appreciation of the difference between good and evil. See the movie because it's great to look at, and it's a pleasure to watch Meryl Streep do what only she can do.",7,0,1,1 January 2008
Lion," Alone and desperate on the streets of Calcutta
","Lion (2016) was directed by Garth Davis. It's a coming of age story, but the story it tells is not one that you'll see in many movies. (I'm sure you could see stories like it every day in Calcutta, but those stories don't usually come to the screen.) Sunny Pawar plays the protagonist, Saroo, as a child. By bad luck, Saroo is locked inside a railway car at a station near his home. When he gets out of the train he's in Calcutta. He's trapped in a totally different world--urban rather than rural--and a different culture--people speak Bengali and not Hindi. By utilizing ingenuity and intelligence, Saroo manages to survive. Ultimately he's placed in an orphanage, and adopted by an Australian couple, John and Sue Brierley (David Wenham and Nicole Kidman). Wenham and Kidman both do a fine job, in roles that don't really use their talents fully.Saroo is portrayed by Dev Patel as a young adult. He has done very well in the home of the Brierley family, but he can't forget that he had a home and a family in India. The remainder of the plot follows from there.To a certain extent, Lion has been billed as a love story between Patel and Rooney Mara, who portrays his girlfriend, Lucy. Rooney Mara is adorable, but she's not the co-star. I think the love story between the two of them is a fairly awkward plot device. Mara has two expressions--loving and happy, and loving and sad. The real stars of the film are Sunny Pawar and Dev Patel. You really believe in both of their characters, and you can see how the young Saroo could have become the young adult Saroo. Both of them portray their roles brilliantly, and the movie would be worth seeing just to watch them act. (It's a bright, colorful, noisy movie, but it's not costumes, or cinematography, or hundreds of extras that make this film work. It's the acting of Pawar and Patel.)This movie will be better watched in a theater than on the small screen, because of the vast expanses of scenery in all of the locations. We saw this movie at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. On Christmas/Chanukah day, 2016, the Little Theatre showed Lion, Fences, Manchester by the Sea, and Jackie. What other theater in New York Skate could match that combination?",10,3,7,26 December 2016
Romeo + Juliet," The movie that made Claire Danes a star
","Romeo + Juliet (1996) was directed by Baz Luhrmann. Luhrmann is know for his cutting-edge approach to filmmaking, and R + J is no exception. He's updated the setting of Shakespeare's play from Renaissance Verona to contemporary Verona, Florida. However, he's kept Shakespeare's language. Other directors have used the same technique, but I haven't seen a Shakespeare play in a modern setting that is this loud, this noisy, and this filled with primary colors. It's a determinedly modern film, despite the language.To make this concept work, Luhrmann needed the right actors. Leonardo DiCaprio did well enough as Romeo. He was 21 when the film was made, and still had a slender, youthful charm. I think he should keep his day job, though. I'm not eager to watch him play Shakespeare on the stage.By contrast, Claire Danes is the perfect Juliet. From the minute we set eyes on her, we say, 'This is Juliet.' Danes portrays both the strength and vulnerability that define Juliet. (We tend to think of Juliet as a victim, and she is. However, she's not just a victim. She's a tough, tenacious young woman who struggles fiercely against tremendous odds, and almost wins.)Danes was only 16 when R + J was shot, but she was already a seasoned actor. However, it was Luhrmann's film that made her a star. After that, there was no stopping her. I believe she would be extremely successful acting Shakespeare on the stage. Think of her as Lady MacBeth. Danes could goad a husband into killing his king, and she would make everyone in the theater believe that she could do it.The other actors in the film ranged from competent to excellent. I would single out the outstanding work of Harold Perrineaus as Mercutio. When he says, 'A plague on both your houses,' he makes you understand that he means it.R + J has a modest 6.9 IMDb rating. My guess is that it was too old-fashioned for people who wanted a traditional action film, and too wide a stretch for people who wanted classic Shakespeare. I think the movie deserves more than 6.9, and I recommend it. This is a film that will work much better on a large screen than a small screen. Police helicopters, and views from helicopters, will lose some of their power if not seen on a large screen. On the other hand, the film is noisy and drenched with color. If that's not to your taste, the movie might work better on a small screen, where you are somewhat removed from the immediacy of the action.If you don't like Shakespeare, or if you don't like modern-version Shakespeare, here's my suggestion. See the film, and fast forward through the scenes that don't include Juliet. When Claire Danes is on the screen, watch carefully.",9,1,1,19 June 2014
Gone Baby Gone," The mean streets of Dorchester
","Gone Baby Gone (2007) is a crime drama co-written and directed by Ben Affleck. It stars Casey Affleck as Patrick Kenzie, a private detective who works in Dorchester. Dorchester is a huge neighborhood in Boston. It contains upscale areas but also some really rough spots. The overall crime rate in Dorchester is 30% higher than the national average, so it's not a very peaceful place.The premise of the movie is that Kenzie grew up in Dorchester and knows everyone in his neighborhood. He's hired to find a kidnapped girl by the girl's aunt. The thought is that he can talk to people who wouldn't talk to the police. As it turns out, the aunt is right and Kenzie learns things by talking to people who will talk to him.The supporting cast is very strong. Michelle Monaghan portrays Angie Gennaro, Kenzie's lover and his detective partner. Morgan Freeman portrays Jack Doyle, the head of the kidnapping squad, and Ed Harris portrays Remy Bressant, one of the detectives assigned to the case. They all do well in their supporting roles.The problem for me is that I think Casey Affleck was the wrong actor for this role. Director Affleck knew that. There's a line where Kenzie tells the police something like, 'I may look young, but I'm 31.' In fact, Affleck really was 31 when the movie was produced. However, he looks more like an Explorer Scout working on his Law and Justice merit badge than he looks like a street-hardened private detective.Truth in reviewing--there were so many very bad guys, pretty bad guys, and somewhat bad guys in the movie that I lost track of which bad guy was on the screen at any given moment. Win some, lose some. However, I have to admit that the basic question raised by the film was interesting and not easy to answer. The question is whether the end justifies the means. Do you do what the law says is right, or do you do what may well be wrong, but could have a better outcome? Although I believe Affleck was the wrong actor for this role at that time, he portrays his doubts about the case very well. (I should say that I thought Affleck was superb in Manchester by the Sea. In 2016 he was the right actor in the right role.)This movie worked well enough on DVD. It has an excellent 7.7 IMDb rating. I may be overly critical, but it just didn't work for me.",6,2,2,18 July 2017
Notting Hill," This is what romantic comedy looks like!
","Notting Hill (1999), directed by Roger Michell, is a showpiece for Julia Roberts and for London. (Hugh Grant is pretty good too.)The movie is undoubtedly formulaic. From the moment Julia Roberts--Anna Scott, the most famous woman in Hollywood--steps into Hugh Grant's bookstore, we can pretty much predict how the rest of the movie will turn out. My comment about this is, 'So what?' No one wants a romantic comedy with a sad ending, and no one wants to think about whether 'the most famous actress in the world' could really enjoy life with a kind and gentle man who lives and works in Notting Hill.The movie has some real strengths: William Thacker (Grant) has a loving, lovable sister (Emma Chambers), and some great friends. The Portobello Road market and the Notting Hill section of London look colorful and authentic. London gleams in the sunshine, and the posh hotels look, well, posh. Most important, Julia Roberts is perfect for the part. The clichÃ© is that the camera loves Julia Roberts. I would say instead that WE love Julia Roberts. The camera just transmits her beauty and charm so that we can appreciate it. Note: Watch for the lovely Emily Mortimer who plays 'Perfect Girl.' That is, she and William are brought together after Anna breaks his heart, and she would, indeed be perfect for him. However, who wants to see a romantic comedy where the hero says, 'Sure, who needs Anna Scott when Perfect Girl is around?' It just wouldn't be romantic, and it wouldn't be comedy.",8,8,9,27 June 2008
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," Harry Potter 7a
","Almost everyone reading this review will have read the Harry Potter novels and seen the previous six films. Deathly Hallows part 1 is a natural progression from the earlier works--faithful to the book and very well done.I didn't enjoy the film very much, but that reflects the 'calm before the storm' aspect of the plot. Everything in this film is preparing us for the final shootout (curseout?) that will take place in 7b.We don't learn too much new in this movie. We already know that adolescents have sexual fantasies, Emma Watson looks good in jeans, and Voldemort is a really, really bad guy.Except for the three stars, all the other regulars just have cameo roles, although Dauby has one great scene.If you're into Harry Potter, naturally you have to see this film. If not, it's not the one with which to begin. As always, the special effects are great, and many will be lost on a small screen. If you're going to see the movie, see it in a theater if possible.",7,0,0,21 December 2010
Little Miss Sunshine," Very funny, if you don't think about it too much
","'Little Miss Sunshine' (2006), was directed by the husband-and-wife team of Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris. It's a road film--the extended Hoover family (mother, father, daughter, son, grandfather, mother's brother) travel from New Mexico to California in a battered van.Abigail Breslin plays the daughter, Olive Hoover, who is the only stable family member. Her brother has elective mutism, and communicates only by writing. Her uncle has just attempted suicide. Her grandfather (Alan Arkin) is snorting something--I think morphine. Her father (Greg Kinnear) apparently believes the motivational garbage he preaches, and her mother (the excellent Toni Collette) is trying to cope with marital, financial, and family stresses.The movie is hilarious while you're watching it, because the filmmakers set up an enclosed universe in which everything fits together in its own bizarre way. Just don't think too much about the movie afterward, because, when examined logically, everything falls apart. The movie 'Memento' was a film where people got home, took out a piece of paper, and tried to diagram the action. Not a good idea for this film. Accept 'Little Miss Sunshine' for what it is--if you try to analyze it, it won't be funny anymore.",8,1,6,3 October 2006
Silver Linings Playbook," Dysfunctional isn't really funny
","Silver Linings Playbook (2012) was scripted and directed by David O. Russell. It stars Bradley Cooper as Pat, who has been in a mental institution since he 'lost it' when he came home to find his wife in the shower with another man. Robert De Niro is Pat Sr., who makes his living as a gambler and bookie. Enter the beautiful and mysterious Tiffany, played by Jennifer Lawrence. At dinner party, Tiffany and Pat trade tales of their psychotropic medications, and then they enter into a love/hate relationship. Finally, the two become dance partners and enter a dance contest. You can take it from there.I didn't enjoy the movie much, but I give Russell credit for showing us that mental illness really is an illness, and it's not funny. Jennifer Lawrence deserved an Oscar for her role in Winter's Bone, but I wasn't that impressed by her acting here. Robert De Niro's role struck me as tiresome. Of course he's one of our greatest actors, but I think he was just going through the motions in this film.We saw this movie in a theater, but it will work well on DVD. It's worth seeing, but not if something better is playing.",7,0,0,24 March 2013
Being John Malkovich," Not my kind of movie
","'Being John Malkovich' left me cold.  Actually, it turned me off.  The basic premise was interesting, but it was all downhill from there.  This movie contains significant scenes of violence against a woman.  This violence is gratuitous; it doesn't really stem from preceding scenes and the perpetrator is not portrayed as particularly reprehensible.  Apparently a lot of people liked this film.  I'm not sure what movie they saw.  Can it be the same one I saw?",1,3,6,20 November 1999
Gandhi," Outstanding depiction of Gandhi and his time
","Gandhi (1982) was directed by Lord Richard Attenborough. It stars Sir Ben Kingsley as Rohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi. This is a superb film, which I saw when it was released, and which I've just seen again on DVD.Director Attenborough pulled out all the stops when he cast this film. We see such actors as Trevor Howard, John Gielgud, John Mills, and Martin Sheen. However, the film is called Gandhi, it's about Gandhi, and everything depends on the actor playing Gandhi. Luckily for us, Attenborough cast Ben Kingsley in the lead role. He's a great actor, he's on the screen most of the time, and he's outstanding. Watching this movie is an experience that makes you ask, 'How does he do it.' How can an actor embody a role in such a way that you think you are watching Gandhi himself, and not someone playing Gandhi in a movie? You'll have to ask Ben Kingsley, because I certainly don't have the answer. This is a long film, shown in theaters with an intermission. It's noisy, colorful, and sometimes violent. This works well for us as viewers, because we are watching a movie about a noisy, colorful, and sometimes violent time and place.Attenborough wasn't perfect. I think he wasted the talents of Geraldine James as Mirabehn, a woman who left her upper-class English life to become Gandhi's disciple. We see her often enough, but usually she is in the background, putting a cool compress on Gandhi's brow, or giving him his first bites of food after he has been fasting. She's not given a chance to show herself as a three-dimensional character. Candice Bergen plays the famous photographer Margaret Bourke-White. It's true that Bourke-White took iconic photographs of Gandhi, but when she shows up in the film, she appears to have wandered onto the wrong movie set. It's as if the script said, 'Bourke-White arrives, looks beautiful, takes some photos, looks beautiful again, and then leaves.' She received co-star billing, when she really had just a cameo role. It doesn't hurt to be famous and, well, beautiful.This is a movie that you should not miss. If you saw it when it was released, it's worth seeing again. 'Gandhi' has stood the test of time, and it doesn't have an outdated feel to it. A movie of this type was made to be shown in a theater, and that's where it will work best. However, it works very well on the small screen. Just don't miss this outstanding film.",10,1,1,2 January 2016
Spirited Away," Great animation; good movie
","This Japanese film, which I saw under the title 'Spirited Away,' has glorious animation. However, I found it somewhat long and often repetitive.  It probably makes better cultural sense in Japan, without dubbing, but the basic concepts of loyalty, truth, bravery, and sacrifice transcend cultural differences.The main character, Sen, is totally believable as a young girl in a bizarre setting, who learns to adapt to new people, new customs, and new emergencies.  When Sen sets her jaw and follows through on a plan, I felt like saying, 'Yes!  Go for it, Sen.'Warning:  I would hesitate to take young children to this film. It has many frightening scenes, and could be the source of nightmares or worse, even in today's kids who have 'seen it all.'",8,2,4,25 December 2002
Jackie," What happens when suddenly you're not the First Lady?
","Jackie (2016/V) was directed by Pablo Larraín. This film is about the first few hours and first few days after the assassination of President John Kennedy. His wife, Jacqueline, is faced with the fact that she is now a widow with two young children. Beyond that, the immense authority that she had as First Lady is gone. The best she can do is protect her children, and plan her husband's funeral to be exactly as she wants it to be. Her hope is that the nation will remember his presidency as a time when Camelot was real. Natalie Portman portrays Jackie Kennedy, and she demonstrates what an excellent actor she is. She doesn't really look like Jacqueline Kennedy, but she's equally slender and she wears her designer clothing with a sense of fashion and dignity, just as Mrs. Kennedy did.This is, naturally, a sad and discouraging movie. Camelot disappeared and the memory of Camelot was tarnished by later events. The music utilizes the dark sounds of cello or bass--very sad indeed. (Of course, it reflects a very sad time for those of us who lived through it.)This movie will work well enough on the small screen. However, we saw it at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Note that on December 25th, 2016, The Little was showing Jackie, Manchester by the Sea, Lion, and Fences. How many theaters in New York State were showing four movies that good on Christmas/Chanukah Day?",8,0,4,26 December 2016
The Duchess," Why didn't more people like this film?
","The Duchess (2008), directed by Saul Dibb, is a period film with a difference--the events actually happened. Keira Knightley portrays Georgiana, a young 18th Century aristocrat who entered a loveless marriage with the Duke of Devonshire, played well by Ralph Fiennes.The first surprise of the movie is that Knightley is able to look like the real Georgiana, Dutchess of Devonshire, whose likeness was captured by Reynolds and Gainsborough. The second surprise is that Knightley can act! (It's no surprise that she's strikingly beautiful in lavish period costumes, but I didn't know she had talent.)I don't pretend to be an expert in English history of that period, but the outline of the plot is historically accurate. In fact, the only overt historical discrepancy I could find is that Charles Grey (Dominic Cooper), who is in love with Georgiana, is portrayed as relatively poor and low-born. In reality, his family was powerful and well-connected.Hayley Atwell does well as Bess Foster, the Duchess's closest friend, and the incomparable Charlotte Rampling portrays Lady Spencer, Georgiana's mother. (Yes--it's the same Spencer family. Princess Diana in many ways reenacted the role of the Duchess 200 years later.)I enjoyed the film, and gave it a vote of 9. The IMDb average for the The Duchess is a mediocre 7.0. This is an excellent film. Why didn't more people like it?",9,0,0,17 February 2009
To Rome With Love," Woody is back!
","To Rome with Love (2012) was written and directed by Woody Allen. In this movie Allen does for Rome what he has already done for New York and Paris--transformed the city into a magical kingdom where anything is possible.The film doesn't have one plot, it has four. It doesn't have one star, it has about a dozen.The four plots involve a young small-town Italian couple who arrive in Rome right after their marriage; a retired opera director (Allen) and his wife who come to Rome to join their daughter, who has fallen in love with a young Italian lawyer; a famous architect (Alec Baldwin) who interposes himself into the life of a young U.S. architecture student living in Rome; and an ordinary citizen (Roberto Benigni) who overnight inexplicably finds himself a major celebrity.Things I learned about Woody Allen from this film: he hasn't lost his touch as a director; he hasn't lost his touch as an actor, as long as he can play Woody Allen; he hasn't lost the ability to write some of the funniest lines you'll ever hear in a movie.Other things I learned: filling a movie with beautiful women--Ellen Page, Alessandra Mastronardi, Penélope Cruz--is generally a very good idea; Penélope Cruz was born to play an extremely sought-after high-class prostitute. My wife and I enjoyed this film, and it was clear that other people in the theater liked it as well. Question: why is it rated 6.3 by the IMDb voters? Here's another case--see my review of 'First Position'--where I wonder if the voters who gave it a 6 saw the same movie that I saw. 'To Rome with Love' is a funny, intelligent film with great acting and great views of Rome. See it and decide for yourself whether it deserves a 6.3 or a 9.",9,41,72,8 July 2012
Before Sunset," Best romantic movie of 2004!
","Before Sunset (2004) is a quiet romantic masterpiece. This movie picks up where the excellent film Before Sunrise left off nine years earlier.  Director RichardLinklater puts two outstanding actors on the screen and then lets them interact for 80 minutes in 'real time.'In Before Sunset Jesse (Ethan Hawke) has written a bestseller.  The plot of this novel is his short encounter with Celine (Julie Delpy).  Celine has read the book, and has sought out Jesse who is promoting the book at an English-language bookstore in Paris.What follows is one the most naturalistic series of interactions between two people that I've ever seen in a film.  Both actors are given script credit. Obviously they improvised much of the dialog within the basic plot context.The film's visual aspect is enhanced by the lovely scenes of Paris, and the ethereal beauty of Julie Delpy, who is exactly right for the part.Before Sunset is an intelligent and entrancing film.

The Princess Bride," The perfect movie for all ages
","The Princess Bride (1987) directed by Rob Reiner, is the perfect movie for all ages. College students love it. I watched it with my wife, grown daughter and her husband, and their two young children. It worked for all of us. The screenplay, by William Goldman, is based on his book. Not surprisingly, the film captures the spirit--as well as the details--of the original. The acting is excellent, in an appropriate over-the-top sort of way. Cary Elwes is fine as Westley and so is Robin Wright as Buttercup, The Princess Bride. However, the really great roles belong to Mandy Patinkin as the swordsman Inigo Montoya, Wallace Shawn as the Sicilian genius, Vizzini, and André the Giant as Fezzik, who is, indeed, a giant.Billy Crystal as Miracle Max and Carol Kane as his wife Valerie have just one scene, but it's a highlight of the film Hilarious doesn't begin to describe it.No lover of movies can afford to miss The Princess Bride. It worked well when we saw it on DVD, so there's no excuse not to rent it or buy it. It would be sad to go through life without seeing The Princess Bride at least once. (Several times would be better, but once is a must.)",9,2,4,4 April 2013

However, all of the boys respond to music, and their lives are changed because of the efforts of the new teacher. The acting is good, and the effort is sincere.

My compliments to him on an outstanding acting job.The point of the film for me was not pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's miraculous survival of the Nazi Holocaust, but rather the portrayal of an important--and horrific--aspect of the Holocaust itself.By concentrating on the history of the Holocaust in the Warsaw Ghetto, director Roman Polanski has reminded us of the inconceivably evil events that occurred there.  [Not commented upon was the betrayal of the Polish partisans in Warsaw by the Russian army.  This grim story will require another movie.]In any event, this movie must be seen. Luckily, it is as close as most of us will ever come to evil on this massive a scale.  (At least, that is my hope. Current events may prove me wrong.)If we are to prevent evil, we must understand it, and if we are to understand it, we must make an emotional attachment to the people involved.  'The Pianist' makes this attachment possible.",10,0,1,18 February 2003
The Grand Budapest Hotel," Minority opinion about this movie--it's good, but not great
","The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014) was written and directed by Wes Anderson. It stars the excellent Ralph Fiennes as M. Gustave, concierge of a famed European luxury hotel. The film is set in the period between the two world wars. Newcomer Tony Revolori plays Zero, a lobby boy whoeventually becomes M. Gustave's sidekick.M. Gustave demands perfection from the staff at the hotel, provides satisfaction to every guest, and knows the correct behavior for any situation. Whether he is at his desk in the hotel, or on a train, or in a prison, M. Gustave maintains his positive, always appropriate behavior. That's a good concept, and it more-or-less holds the film together. More-or-less.Many famous actors appear in small or cameo roles. Amng these are F. Murray Abraham, Adrien Brody, Willem Dafoe, Jeff Goldblum, Harvey Keitel, Jude Law, Bill Murray, Tilda Swinton, Tom Wilkinson, and Owen Wilson. It's always fun to recognize a familiar face, and identify the actor before she or he moves on.When I was in the theater, I laughed a fair amount. However, the movie went in several different directions at once. It was as if Anderson thought, 'OK--that's all the laughs I'll get from this situation, time to move on.' Nothing much is left when you get done with those few funny lines. In fact, if you want to save time, watch the trailer. Most of the film's great lines are in it. I respect the opinion of those who think this was one of the greatest movies ever. At the time of this review, GBH is carrying an astounding IMDb rating of 8.4, putting it in the top 150 movies of all time. However, I just didn't think it was that wonderful. It's a good way to pass a few hours, but I wouldn't dream of going back and seeing it again.This is one of those films that really will work better on a large screen. However, if that's not an option, it will be OK on DVD.",7,1,5,2 June 2014
The Favourite," A strong queen and two strong women. Who will prevail?
","The Favourite (2018) was directed by Yorgos Lanthimos. It's an account of a period in the life of Queen Anne, who reigned in the early 18th Century.Olivia Colman plays Queen Anne, Rachel Weisz plays her friend and confidante, Lady Sarah, and Emma Stone portrays Abigail Hill, who wants to be the queen's friend and confidante.I looked at the Wikipedia entry for Queen Anne, and the history is extremely complicated. (It was complicated then, and it's even harder for us to understand 300 years later.) However, the movie plot appears to me to conform closely to history. If you're a history buff, you may know the history, or you may want to check it before you watch the film. If not, let it pass, because the film is really about interpersonal relationships rather than history.Lady Sarah was, indeed, the queen's friend and confidante. The family of Abigail Hill, Sarah's cousin, had fallen onto hard times, and Hill arrived at the palace pleading for a job. She was given a job in the kitchen, but she rose far beyond that.So, my suggestions is to forget the War of the Spanish Succession, Whigs vs. Tories, and Catholics vs. Protestants. Concentrate on three brilliant actors. One is the queen, and the other two are scheming to be the closest to her.I enjoyed this movie, and I recommend it. When was the last time you saw a movie with three women actors as the leads, while men have only supporting roles? That in itself makes the film worth seeing. Of course, better yet, Colman, Weisz, and Stone are wonderful actors, who fit into their roles perfectly.We saw this movie at Rochester's excellent Little Theatre. All the scenery and royal finery will be better appreciated on the large screen. However, I recommend the movie even if watched on the small screen. See it!",9,4,9,23 December 2018
Revolutionary Road," What if the American Dream is a nightmare?
","Revolutionary Road (2008), directed by Sam Mendes, is a great vehicle for Kate Winslet. Winslet is an actor whom I truly admire. A critic has called her the 'Meryl Streep for her generation,' and I agree. Leonardo DiCaprio does a reasonable job as her husband, although for most of the film his expression varies between a scowl and a dark scowl.Frank Wheeler is living the 1950's American dream--well-paying job, beautiful wife, two kids, shiny Oldsmobile, house in Connecticut. April Wheeler is living the dream as well. It's true that her career as an actor has gone nowhere, but she loves her husband and her kids and their beautiful home.Except. . . Frank says he hates his job, and April thinks they should be looking down on the life they're living. They know they're better than other people they see around them. Her thought--let's go to Paris where I can work as a secretary and you can find yourself.The problem with the script is that there's a major scene missing. We're led to understand, in context, that Frank had great dreams for himself, and April shared those dreams. That point is never made clear--when did they decide they could do great things, and what talents did Frank have that people around him didn't have? (We also never see Winslet, as April, acting. Early in the film, we're shown a scene where she's acted in a community play which, apparently, was horrible.)The film contains some sub-plots, which basically serve as filler. Frank has a dalliance with a secretary, one of their friends is in love with April, and a mentally ill man is the only person who both sees the truth, and is able to tell the truth about what he sees. The strength of the film is in Winslet's acting, and in the basic question: Is the perfect life really the perfect life? If it isn't perfect, what then?",8,0,1,1 February 2009
The Lives of Others," We all have something to hide.
","Das Leben der Anderen (2006) (The Lives of Others) was brilliantly written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The film is a taut thriller. It's also a dramatization of what happened in East Germany--and could happen here--if we allow the government access to every aspect of our lives. Ulrich Mühe stars as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler of the Stasi--the dreaded secret police. The Captain is so talented in interrogation that he gives lectures on interrogation techniques to Stasi cadets.For complex reasons, Wiesler is investigating a prominent couple-- Christa-Maria Sieland, a beautiful and talented actor (Martina Gedeck), and Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) an accomplished author and playwright.Artists in East Germany were strictly controlled by the state. Some of them played an intricate cat-and-mouse game with the Stasi--going just far enough to attract notice, but not so far as to bring about arrest. The problem with the cat-and-mouse game was that the cats had very sharp teeth, which they didn't hesitate to use. Blacklisting was just one of the state's weapons--a single word from a high official and you never acted again, or your plays or music were never performed. Although both Christa-Maria and Georg have been careful and discrete, they haven't been careful and discrete enough to escape the Stasi's interest. The movie, although in color, looks as if it were shot in black and white. The mood and the locations are drab and muted. Obviously, the color reflects the political and social situation of the time. The camerwork and editing were outstanding. Every other aspect of the film is equally excellent, particularly the work of the supporting actors. Not only does this film represent a riveting thriller, but it provides a powerful political message. After you've seen The Lives of Others, you won't keep quiet when someone tells you 'I don't care if the government taps my phone; I've got nothing to hide.'This is an extraordinary film--well acted and directed, with a compelling plot and message. Das Leben der Anderen is the finest movie I've seen this year. It's definitely worth seeking out.",10,27,33,26 March 2007
Room," A brilliant movie, but painful to watch
","Room (2015/I) was directed by Lenny Abrahamson. It stars Jacob Tremblay as Jack and Brie Larson as his mother ('Ma')The situation becomes very clear early in the film. Jack and his mother are held captive by a man who has kidnapped her, raped her, impregnated her, and uses her as his sexual slave. Jack and his mother have lived in a small, locked shed, which they call 'Room.' Jack's mother has lived in 'Room' since she was abducted seven years earlier. Jack has lived there for all of his life--five years.By incredible ingenuity, motivated by love, Ma has kept Jack from realizing the horrors of their situation. It's hard to believe that anyone could be so motivated and capable, allowing the boy to believe that his situation is normal, but it works in the film and you accept it.What happens next is pretty well known, but I won't go into it because it might decrease your enjoyment of the movie. It's dramatic, frightening, and, heart-wrenching, all at the same time.Brie Larson does a wonderful job as the mother, and Jacob Tremblay has to be the best child actor we have. He is absolutely brilliant. Director Abrahamson must be an extremely talented man to draw two such great performances from his actors.This is a must-see film, but it's not easy to watch. Even though Room wasn't based on any specific incident, we all know of cases of warped men who have kidnapped and enslaved women. It's hard to think about the lives of those women without becoming depressed. We saw the film at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY. Given the claustrophobic atmosphere of the movie, it will work on the small screen as well. Seek it out and watch, but prepare yourself mentally before you begin.",10,140,188,14 December 2015
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Minority Opinion -- found this film boring
","In view of the frenzy of positive reactions to 'Two Towers,' I don't know if it's even worth registering a negative opinion.  However, I will write a brief review to let people know that--unlike my reaction to the first film in the trilogy--my reaction to this film was, 'Is it ever going to end?'Three hours is a long time to watch endless combat scenes--orcs killed by the thousands-- predictable dialog, and a tedious love story-- sort of.My take is that the magic of the first film has been lost, and the director in this segment is plodding forward, getting ready for the final, go-for-broke, mega-explosion last episode.Next review about hobbits, orcs, wizards, ents, etc. in a year, when the last film in the trilogy is released. Over and out for now.",6,0,0,25 December 2002
Call Me by Your Name," The Tuscan scenery is great!
","Call Me by Your Name (2017) was directed by Luca Guadagnino with screenplay by James Ivory.Although this film has aroused almost cult-like devotion, with an incredibly high IMDb rating of 8.1, I can't recommend it.One of the basic plot devices, over the centuries, is 'There's a stranger in town.' In this film, the stranger is Armie Hammer. Hammer portrays Oliver--a graduate student in anthropology. Oliver is every woman's dream, and every gay man's dream. He's handsome, intelligent, and he's immediately accepted by the villagers as he joins their ongoing card game.Elio Perlman (played by Timothée Chalamet) is the son of the famous anthropologist with whom Oliver is working. He's handsome, intelligent, and talented. The girls love him, but he's exploring his own sexuality. Can you guess what happens next? This is basically a happy movie, because the Perlmans are so loving and approving, and the Tuscan scenery really is beautiful. However, I have to file a minority report and say that it didn't work for me. It all appeared contrived and obvious from beginning to end.This film will work better on the large screen than the small screen, because I feel that you lose out on landscapes when you don't see them in a theater.",6,2,4,15 March 2018
No Man's Land," Grim, powerful war movie
","No Man's Land is a powerful, compelling film about the futility of war.  The three major protagonists, two Bosnians and a Serb, are thrown together in a terrible situation, out of which it will be difficult to escape unscathed.In addition to the warring factions, outside influences enter the picture in the form of a TV news reporter, and members of the UN forces in the  region.  All three principals are excellent actors. In a supporting role, Katrin Cartlidge, as the TV reporter, is outstanding.  The portrayal of the British colonel who commands the UN troops is over-the-top.  Other than that, I believe the script is excellent. This multinational production worked for me on both dramatic and historical grounds.  A must see movie--not visually bloody, but haunting and saddening by what occurs, and what is implied.",10,15,27,17 March 2002
Hidden Figures," Powerful reminder about what life was like for Black people in 1961
","Hidden Figures (2016) was co-written and directed by Theodore Melfi. It's a drama, based on real people and real events. The time is 1961, at the height of the Cold War. The U.S. and Russia are competing in almost every way, including the race against each other for priority in space.NASA was headquartered at Langley Air Force Base in Hampton, Virginia. Even though this was federal property, discrimination against Blacks was routine. As I watched the film, I thought about the levels of discrimination that we see. Of course, there's always the threat of physical violence. (We get a short glimpse of police violence against Blacks in the movie.) Hampton, Virginia, was, indeed, the site of physical violence against Blacks in the 1960's. (In fact, it still is.)However, there were other levels of discrimination. Some were petty, but still humiliating, such as making a Black woman use a 'Colored' coffee pot. Others were far more severe-- keeping Blacks from being promoted to positions of authority within NASA. Some were even worse--telling a Black woman that she could only apply for engineering school if she took some pre-engineering courses at a nearby school. The only problem was that the school was still Whites only.Three highly talented Black women set out to overcome the discrimination and provide NASA with mathematical help that the organization desperately needs. These women--all of whom did, indeed, work for NASA--were Katherine G. Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan, and Mary Jackson. (Portrayed by Taraji P. Henson, Octavia Spencer, and Janelle Monáe.) Henson, Spencer, and Monáe are fine actors, and they do well as individuals, and as a group. The plot of the movie revolves around their attempts to get treated fairly at their work site.Kevin Costner does a good-enough job as Al Harrison, the NASA Director. Kirsten Dunst does an excellent job as Vivian Mitchell, who is in middle management. She's officious, uncaring, and very White. When the women complain to her, she just gives them a false smile and says, 'Well, that's NASA.' She doesn't make the rules, but she doesn't try to change them either.People have called Hidden Figures a 'feel-good movie,' which in some respects it is. On the other hand, who can feel good about the racism in our society, then and now?This is an important movie, but not because it makes you feel good. I think the message is that some highly talented people can break through prejudice and prove just how good they are at what they do. That opens the way for other highly talented--and less talented--people to follow them.We saw this film on the large screen, but it will work well on DVD. It's a worthwhile movie and definitely worth seeing.",9,3,10,24 February 2017
The Imitation Game," More than just a film about breaking the Enigma code
","The Imitation Game (2014) was directed by Morten Tyldum. The film is about a remarkable achievement--the breaking of the German naval Enigma code, considered by everyone to be unbreakable.Most of the events depicted in the film are historical facts--as I learned from Wikipedia after seeing the movie. (However, don't read the Wikipedia article first, because it may ruin the film if you do.) A mathematical genius named Alan Turing, played by Benedict Cumberbatch, broke the Enigma code by essentially inventing the computer. There was a woman named Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley) to whom Turing proposed. Social prejudice kept her from being a formal part of the code-breaking team, but she worked on the code with Turing informally.)We learn early in the movie that Turing was gay, and it appears obvious-- although not stated--that he had a condition somewhere along the autism spectrum. The film begins in media res--in 1951, when the police are investigating a break-in in Turing's home. That means that most of the scenes--Turing at school, and Turing working to break the code--are shown in flashback. This technique works, especially because the young actor playing Turing as a boy is excellent. How the break-in relates to the eventual outcome of the film wasn't at all clear to me. There was, indeed, a causal relationship, but if it was spelled out, I missed it. That's another matter that the Wikipedia article will clarify. I thought the acting in the movie was excellent, and the tension about breaking the Enigma code was almost palpable, even though we know that the code was broken. Sometimes director Tyldum is a little heavy-hand in telling us how important it was to intercept German messages. We see the code-breaking team staring glumly at another failed attempt, and then we see German tanks, or planes, or ships on the attack. Not exactly subtle.This isn't a great film, but I think it's definitely worth seeing. We saw it at the excellent Little Theatre in Rochester, NY, but it will work well on DVD.",7,2,6,30 December 2014
The Piano," Unusual and powerful
","The Piano (1993) was written and directed by Dame Jane Campion. It stars Holly Hunter as Ada McGrath, a woman who is mute. She arrives in New Zealand from Scotland, with her ten-year-old daughter, as a mail-order bride. Anna Paquin plays her daughter, Flora. Her husband, Alisdair Stewart, is portrayed by Sam Neill. Harvey Keitel is their neighbor.It's hard to say much about the plot without revealing it, so I'll focus on other aspects of the movie. Just for the record, don't watch the trailer if you intend to see the film. The trailer tells too much about the plot.Dame Jane Campion is a brilliant director, and Holly Hunter is perfect as a strong Victorian woman .Harvey Keitel and Sam Neill are both gifted actors, who give us solid performances.However, Anna Paquin, a (then) amateur actor, steals the show as her mother's interpreter and companion. Paquin--at age 10--won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.This isn't a film for the squeamish or the faint of heart. (Or for people who are offended by nudity.) We saw it on DVD. It would work better in a theater--some of the scenic shots are breathtaking. The Piano has a very strong 7.6 IMDb rating. (Even the top 1,000 raters--who never like any movie--gave it a 7.1.) I think it deserves that rating and more.P.S. Holly Hunter plays the piano herself in the film. It's hard to believe that it wasn't dubbed, because her playing is extraordinary.",9,1,2,30 July 2019
Cold War," Romeo and Juliet in Cold War Poland
","The Polish movie Zimna wojna (2018) was shown in the U.S. with the translated title Cold War. It was co-written and directed by Pawel Pawlikowski.The movie stars Joanna Kulig as Zula, a young woman whom we first see as a trainee at a folk dance school. It's there she falls in love with Wiktor, portrayed by Tomasz Kot.Zula is a rural girl, whereas Wiktor is a sophisticated professional. Despite this, they fall desperately in love. The plot of the movie is that of star-crossed lovers who want to be free in a time when no one was free in Poland.This was a very good movie, but not a great movie. Although the lovers endlessly say that they love each other, in my opinion the chemistry wasn't there. Also, they make very bad decisions for reasons they don't explain. So, partly, the star-crossed lovers are to blame for their bad fortune.Still, although it's grim, the film does keep your interest throughout, and the music that they create is worth hearing.The two protagonists are good actors, as is Borys Szyc, who portrays Kaczmarek. Kaczmarek probably would have chosen another role in life, but he accepts the situation as it is. He's the link between the dance group and the Polish/Russian Communist apparatus. He's always watching, and always seeing.We saw this film at the excellent Little Theatre as part of the outstanding Rochester Film Festival. It will work well on the small screen.",9,10,25,14 November 2018
Pride & Prejudice," A for Effort, but that's not enough.
","'Pride & Prejudice' (2005), directed by Joe Wright, is an honest--but not very effective--attempt to bring Jane Austen's novel to the screen.The plot of the novel and the film boils down to the love/hate relationship between Elizabeth Bennet (Keira Knightley) and Mr. Darcy (Matthew MacFadyen). I thought MacFayden was adequate as Darcy, although possibly somewhat coarse in appearance and manners. (Darcy is a snob, but he should be portrayed as an elegant snob.)Keira Knightley obviously works hard at portraying Elizabeth Bennet. She's a fine actor, but she's very much a 21st Century woman, and I had trouble accepting her in this period piece. Unfortunately, I never caught any true chemistry between the two lead actors, and, without that, nothing else can really work well.Simon Woods was miscast and/or misdirected in his role as Mr. Bingley. Bingley may not have the strength of character that Darcy has, but he shouldn't be portrayed as a callow fool.All the other actors did a competent job, especially Rosamund Pike who was luminous as Jane Bennet (Elizabeth's older sister), and Kelly Reilly, as the very beautiful and vicious Caroline Bingley.The outdoor scenes were predictably colorful--what director can resist dogs, pigs, geese, chickens, ducks, and swans in a period film? However, I found these scenes--as well as the ball scenes--to be overly orchestrated and too meticulous.Finally, I can't see how any discussion of this film could suggest that it was overly sexual. I can't even understand why it was given a PG rating--I think G would have been more appropriate. There's one instance of male nudity, but the genitalia belong to a pig. There's one instance of female nudity, but the female portrayed is a statue. There are many reasons to see or not see 'Pride and Prejudice,' but excessive sexuality shouldn't be among them.In summary, I think this movie represents a sincere attempt at the cinematic portrayal of a great work of fiction. I think the director didn't succeed in this attempt, but the film isn't a disaster, and it's worth seeing as long as you're not expecting a masterpiece.",7,1,1,27 November 2005
Selma," A truly great movie about a terrible time
","Selma (2014) was directed by Ava DuVernay. It stars David Oyelowo as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Carmen Ejogo as Coretta Scott King. The story of the film is based on reality--50 years ago thousands of brave people attempted to walk from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, and were terrorized by local and state police before they finally succeeded.A disclaimer at the end of the film tells us that, although the movie is based on actual events, it isn't a documentary. Fair enough-- Shakespeare's History plays aren't based on strict facts and chronology either. What we want from this film is fact that is portrayed dramatically, and 'Selma' delivers.It's probably hard for young people to believe that segregation and race hatred were the norm in our nation just 50 years ago. (Yes, the South was worse than other parts of the country, but segregation was everywhere.) We now take it for granted that everyone has the right to vote, and that we can have an African-American President.'Selma' shows us how this progress came about. It came about because of the incredible bravery of African-American people, and because of the astute tactics of the leaders of the civil rights movement.Both Oyelowo and Ejogo are superb actors, and very believable in their roles. Oyelowo looks something like Dr. King, so we can say, 'close enough.' Ejogo looks exactly like Coretta Scott King--I found the resemblance uncanny.This movie will repay your time by providing both history and drama. The story needs to be heard by young people, but, in my opinion, the violence is so terrible, and so realistic, that young children shouldn't be in the audience. That's too bad, because--aside from that caveat-- I think everyone should be in the audience. We need to hold on to this part of our history to remember where we were, where we are, and how we got from there to here.The movie will probably work better on the large screen, but, if you can't see it in a theater, see it on DVD. Just be sure to see it!Note on the IMDb rating: As I'm writing this review, 'Selma' has an excellent rating of 7.7. However, the distribution of votes is strange. 68% of reviewers gave it an 8, 9, or 10. However, 424 people--almost 9%--rated the film as 1. I'm going to start a thread asking, 'Why did you give this film a rating of 1?' People who gave it a rating of 1 must have had their reasons. What were those reasons? We'll see who answers, and what they say.",10,5,15,13 January 2015
The Artist," Yes, it really is a silent film
","The Artist (2011) was written and directed by Michel Hazanavicius. It's awkward to give a lukewarm review to a film that's received multiple Oscars, and carries a impressive IMDb rating of 8.4. Nevertheless, I was disappointed by this movie.It was a stroke of genius to conceive of making a silent film in the 21st Century. All credit to director Hazanavicius for that. However, the manner in which the concept was carried out left me somewhat bored and disappointed.The Artist touches on a situation that we've seen before--the trajectories of a young woman and an older man cross as she is going up and he is going down. (Think of 'A Star is Born.') So, that's a somewhat tired concept. Hiding it behind the 'great silent star, but couldn't make the transition to talkies' doesn't cover up the fact that the plot is an old one.Also, the director has chosen to make the film not just silent, but in the less-than-subtle style of many silent films. It's purposely obvious and melodramatic. I respect the thinking behind the decision, but I don't enjoy watching obvious, melodramatic movies--silent or with spoken dialog.Finally, the film is 10 or 15 minutes too long in my opinion. Some judicious editing might have improved it.The two stars, Jean Dujardin and Bérénice Bejo are very good. Ms. Bejo is very beautiful by 21st Century standards, but manages to also look beautiful in a way that would have worked 80 years earlier. It's difficult to comment on the acting, because the actors are in a new movie where they have to act like actors in an old movie. That's hard to manage, and hard to evaluate. All in all, this is a movie worth seeing because it's unique. Just don't go to it expecting more than the film can provide. We saw it on a large screen, in the restored Star Theatre in Dansville, NY. The Star was built in 1921, and did, indeed screen silent movies. The theater ambiance helped me enjoy the film. However, The Artist will work well in a cineplex or on the small screen.Addendum in 2013: Figure skating fans already know that The Artist figured prominently in the 2013 World Figure Skating Championship held in March in London, Ontario. Denis Ten, a skater who represents Kazakhstan, won the silver medal when he used the music from this film in both his short and long programs. The brilliant choreographer Lori Nichol created a situation where the short program represented the beginning of the movie, and the long program represented the middle and the end. You would think that someone before Nichol would have thought to create a continual story line between the short and long programs, but no one had ever done this before.Of course, in the final analysis, it was Ten's superb skating that brought him the silver medal. (I didn't much like the movie, but the use of the music for figure skating really worked!) Red-125",7,1,4,4 March 2012
Woman in Gold," See the movie, then see the painting
","Woman in Gold (2015), directed by Simon Curtis, is about a painting--Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer--a 1907 work by Gustav Klimt. The painting was owned by Austrian Jews, and it was immediately confiscated when Austria joined Germany and the Nazis gained control of the country.The beautiful painting was proudly displayed in Austria after World War II ended. The basic plot of this film is the attempt of an elderly descendant of the owners--Helen Mirren--to regain what was stolen from her family. In this quest she's aided by a young lawyer--Randol Schoenberg--and an Austrian journalist, played by Daniel Brühl.We know the painting was eventually recovered, so there's no actual suspense. However, that doesn't mean the movie isn't gripping and compelling. The Austrian government fought with every tool at its disposal to keep the painting, and the David & Goliath struggle must have truly looked hopeless at the time. (It's easy in retrospect to say, 'Of course she should and will get the painting.' But this battle was waged for seven years, and, while it was going on, there must have been more grim moments than happy ones.)The most poignant part of the movie isn't about the painting per se, but about the fate of Austrian and German Jews, who believed they were integrated into society, and were respected by all. This society turned upon them in an instant, and suddenly they were fleeing for their lives. Some of them escaped, but most didn't. The society and culture they loved suddenly had no use for them, and wanted them destroyed. Even those who survived physically must have been scarred forever psychologically.People say, 'You've seen the movie, now read he book.' Well, there is, indeed, a book, but what I really mean is, 'You've seen the movie. Now see the painting.' The Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer has pride of place in the Neue Galerie on New York's Upper East Side (near the Metropolitan Museum of Art.) We saw it, and it is indeed beautiful. People are lined up around the block to view the painting that was taking away forcibly, and taken back legally.",10,2,6,1 June 2015
The Wind that Shakes the Barley," Brilliant film about the Irish revolution and civil war
","The Wind that Shakes the Barley (2006) was directed by Ken Loach.Cillian Murphy portrays Damien, a young physician who is drawn into the Irish revolution and, later, the civil war. Orla Fitzgerald plays Sinead, a young woman who works with the rebels and is in love with Damien. Damien loves her as well, but nothing can be certain in a war zone.Director Loach portrays the situation on the ground very well. We believe in the cruelty of the British soldiers and the determination of the rebels. We see scenes of fighting that look all too real. However, Loach assumes that we have a certain amount of knowledge about the earlier rebellion in 1916, the dock strike, and the pros and cons of the treaty with England. Most of us in the U.S. don't have that knowledge.If you're going to watch the movie, I would suggest picking up some basic information about Irish history from 1916 to 1923. That's what I did, and it was worth the effort.We saw the film on the small screen. It would work better in a theater, but it worked well enough on DVD. The movie has a strong IMDb rating of 7.5. I think it's even better than that.P.S. The great Irish traditional singer Peggy Lynch sings the title song during a wake for a slain revolutionary. She's wonderful.",9,1,1,2 September 2019
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Good Harry Potter, but not great Harry Potter
","Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), directed by Mike Newell, is a must-see movie for Harry Potter fans. It can't be easy to direct a Harry Potter film--each book is crammed with new characters and a complex plot. Director Newall tries to squeeze in as many events and plot twists as possible, but the film still struck me as rushed and poorly edited. If you've seen the three previous movies, and read the book, everything will make sense and you can lean back and enjoy the special effects. Otherwise, some of the scenes will will be confusing and hard to follow.The acting is uniformly excellent, especially in the case of the lead actors: Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger, and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley.The supporting actors--Timothy Spall, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Miranda Richardson are all skilled professionals who perform their roles with their usual competence.If you're a Harry Potter fan, you obviously should and will see this movie. If not, I don't think there's any compelling reason to seek it out.",8,0,0,30 December 2005
Three Colors: Blue," This is a must-see film if you love French cinema
","The French movie Trois couleurs: Bleu was shown in the U.S. with the title Three Colors: Blue (1993). It was written and directed by Krzysztof Kieslowski. (It's one of the Three Colors trilogy by director Kieslowski. The other two are Three Colors: White with Julie Delpy, and Three Colors: Red with Irène Jacob.)The film opens with a tragic accident. Julie Vignon (Juliette Binoche) is riding in a car with her husband and young daughter when the brakes fail and the car smashes into a tree. Her husband and daughter are killed. Julie is seriously injured, but survives.This isn't only a personal tragedy; it's a national tragedy as well. Julie's husband is a famous composer, and he was in the midst of creating a major piece of music that would celebrate the possibility of a united Europe.The rest of the movie shows us how Julie copes with her new life situation, and her possible love in the person of her husband's colleague Olivier, played by Benoît Régent. Binoche is at the center of the film. She is the sun around which all the other characters revolve. I don't know if the movie would have worked with a different actor in the role.Binoche is outstanding. We know she's outstanding. She knows she's outstanding. Most important, director Kieslowski knows she's outstanding. She's in almost every scene, and, in almost every scene, she's front and center. That's because Kieslowski can't take his eyes --or his camera--away from her.Binoche is beautiful, but in a unique way. Some of her contemporary French female actors--Anne Parillaud, Emmanuelle Béart--are classically beautiful. However, Binoche is beautiful in her own strong, intelligent way. OK--as my wife pointed out, her cheekbones have cheekbones. Still, she's not standard 'movie star' beautiful. She's a great actor who happens to be very attractive. It's a wonderful combination.We saw this film at the excellent Dryden Theatre at George Eastman Museum in Rochester, NY. It was shown as part of the 'Three Colors: Remembering Krzysztof Kieslowski' series. It was great to see the movie on the large screen, but it will work almost as well on the small screen. This is a 'must see' film for people who love French cinema. Even if you don't love French cinema, seek it out and watch it. You won't be disappointed.",10,1,1,10 March 2016
The Shape of Water," Suspend disbelief twice, and then enjoy the movie
","The Shape of Water (2017) was co-written and directed by Guillermo del Toro. It stars Sally Hawkins as Elisa Esposito, Octavia Spencer as her best friend Zelda, Doug Jones as 'Amphibian Man,' and Michael Shannon as Richard Strickland, of 'Security.'In order to enjoy this movie, you have to suspend disbelief twice. First, you have to accept the concept that there's a large amphibian creature that has been captured by the army, and is chained inside a high-security military facility.Then, you have to accept the fact that Sally Hawkins isn't beautiful. Sally Hawkins is beautiful, but she's a good enough actor to carry off her role as a shy, mousey, mute woman. Elisa has a job as one of the janitorial staff at the facility. Naturally, she comes into contact with the creature, and communicates with him in sign language. All this is laid out in the first few minutes. After that, the plot proceeds.Hawkins is great, and so is Octavia Spencer. However, I give the acting honors to Michael Shannon. He embodies pure evil. He always carries a cattle prod with him, which he uses with pleasure whenever he can.Suspending belief, as I noted above, is required to enjoy the film. However, you have to suspend belief again, because, even by the internal rules of the film, some things didn't make sense. (That's why I didn't give the movie a rating of 10.) One very positive factor is that the Amphibian Man is an actor in an extremely effective costume. There's a human being inside that costume, and he can act!The Shape of Water has an extremely high IMDb rating of 8.2. Not everyone liked it however, including Margaret Anne. She would rate it 6. I gave it a 9.We saw the film at Rochester's wonderful Little Theatre. It will work almost as well on the small screen.P.S. Stay for the credits. You'll hear 'You'll Never Know' sung by someone with an incredible voice. If you don't recognize the voice, try to guess.",10,46,89,31 January 2018
Enemy at the Gates," Gripping and gritty war film
","Enemy at the Gates (2001) was co-written and directed by Jean-Jacques Annaud. The movie takes place during the Battle of Stalingrad, and is based on true historical events. Jude Law plays the soldier Vassili Zaitsev, a Russian peasant who has the skills and the bravery to become the chief sniper for the beleaguered Russian army in Stalingrad. Ed Harris is Major König, the German sniper who was sent to Stalingrad to eliminate Vassili. Both actors are excellent in their roles--Law as the intelligent, but unsophisticated, hunter, and Harris as the worldly, arrogant officer who is also an amazing marksman.All Russian military units were accompanied by political commissars. Joseph Fiennes stars as Commisar Danilov, who befriends Vassili, and who is clever enough to recognize the propaganda value of a heroic Russian sniper. Both he and Vassili are in love with soldier Tania Chernova, played by Rachel Weisz. Bob Hoskins does a brilliant job portraying Nikita Khrushchev, whose career was already on the rise during the battle for the city.The Battle of Stalingrad may have been the most important battle in World War II. However, movies about battles belong on the History Channel. As in 'Saving Private Ryan,' a war movie must involve us in the lives of the men and women who fought it. Vassili's story does, indeed, involve us. We are involved even more than in other war films, because the story is true. The German army, which at one point controlled 90% of Stalingrad, had totally disintegrated by the time the battle was over. Determined Russian resistance and the Russian winter broke Hitler's army the way they broke Napolean's army. In Napolean's case, a tattered remnant of his army struggled back towards France. When the Battle of Stalingrad was over, there wasn't any German army left to return home. Hitler refused to consider retreat, when retreat was still an option. He told the German soldiers to fight to the last man and the last bullet, and that's what they did.I saw this movie on DVD. It worked well enough, although it would surely have been better on a large screen.",8,1,2,7 January 2012
Love Actually," A waste of good acting talent!
","Love, Actually (2003) written and directed by Richard Curtis, is a movie about Christmas that misses the mark.  In fact, it misses more than one mark because it's not a good screwball comedy, it's not a good romance, and it's not a good drama.The film tries for a light touch, but doesn't achieve it.  It's hard to believe a director could waste the talents of actors like Colin Firth, Liam Neeson, Hugh Grant, Laura Linney, and the incomparable Emma Thompson, but Curtis manages this feat.There are eight couples--more or less-- in the movie, but the match that should have been the highlight of the film is between Hugh Grant as Prime Minister, and Martine McCutcheon, as Natalie, the employee whose job apparently is to bring him his tea..  This Cinderella story starts out with the first meeting of the Prime Minister and his staff, in which Natalie delivers the unforgettable speech, 'Hello, David.  Oh, sh*t, I can't believe I just did that. Oh and now I've gone and said 'sh*t' twice.'  Not a great marital prospect for a young statesman.(If you want to see an intelligent movie about a politician's romance, rent 'The American President'(1995) with Annette Bening and Michael Douglas.)  In fact, I suggest that you stay away from this 'feel good' movie that will probably make you feel bad.  Rent 'The American President,' and stay home and enjoy it.",4,1,2,24 November 2003
The Reader," Kate Winslet is a wonderful actor. She can't carry an entire film.
","The Reader (2008), directed by Stephen Daldry, is a coming-of-age movie that begins in postwar Germany. The film stars Kate Winslet, who is one of the great actors of our time. She turns in another excellent performance in a difficult role. Ralph Fiennes does his usual workmanlike job, and Bruno Ganz and Lena Olin appear in supporting roles. Olin has a great scene near the end of the movie; Ganz appears to be walking through the film without really noticing where he is.The film deals with the question of German guilt, and also with the complex relationship between the characters played by Winslet and Fiennes. (There's also a subplot about Fiennes and his daughter, but that never goes anywhere.)Given all the fine actors, and the plot potential of this movie, I was expecting a truly memorable film experience. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. The film plods along, with a fair amount of histrionics, but not much else, until it gradually winds down and fades out as the credits start to roll.Winslet is talented and beautiful and Fiennes is talented and handsome. I'd like to see them together in a film that doesn't hinge on a 'mystery' that's not all that mysterious.",7,7,13,27 December 2008
The Queen," Helen Mirren IS Queen Elizabeth!
","The Queen (2006) directed by Stephen Frears, demonstrates the great talent of Helen Mirren, who portrays Queen Elizabeth II. The film is a fictionalized account of the royal reaction to the death of Princess Diana. Mirren is astoundingly good in this role. As I watched the movie, I had to keep reminding myself that it was not, in fact, Queen Elizabeth II I was watching on the screen.It's obviously impossible for any of us to know what was going on in the minds of the royal family right after Princess Diana died. This film puts forward the plausible explanation that Queen Elizabeth was just following proper and correct protocol as she understood it. Certainly, the Queen emerges as a sympathetic character--someone bound by tradition to do things (and not do things) in a way that might seem unnatural to the rest of us.Helen Mirren carries this film. Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, James Cromwell as Prince Philip, Alex Jennings as Prince Charles, and Sylvia Syms as the Queen Mother never convince us that they are anything other than actors portraying the royal family in a movie. They don't get inside their characters the way the Helen Mirren gets inside her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II. Tony Blair's character never convinces. In particular, the opening scene--in which he meets the queen in his new role as prime minister--is awkwardly written and badly acted. It stretches belief to suggest that someone clever enough to become the prime minister of England would be so naive about the the proper protocol expected at this important and symbolic occasion. Despite these weaknesses, I enjoyed the movie and would certainly recommend it to others. Helen Mirren unquestionably deserves an Oscar for her work in this film.",9,0,1,11 February 2007
La Vie En Rose," 'No Regrets'
","'La Môme' (2007), was shown in the U.S. with the title 'La Vie en Rose.' The film was co-written and directed by Olivier Dahan. It portrays the life of the great French singer, Edith Piaf.Piaf's life was so full of hardship, tragedy, and triumph that even this long film could not really accommodate all of it. In view of Piaf's dismal childhood, and her continual forced partings from people whom she loves and who love her, it's amazing that she survived at all, and more amazing that she could rise to become a national icon.Marion Cotillard looks like Piaf, and her acting is outstanding. Both Manon Chevallier, who plays the five-year-old Piaf, and Pauline Burlet, who plays the ten-year-old Piaf, are capable child actors. The problem with the film is that so much happened in Piaf's short life. Most of it was bad, some of it was good, but it happened, and seemingly almost all of it was put into the movie. That might have worked had Mr. Dahan stuck to a historic time line. Instead, he has chosen to use flashbacks and flashforwards to add interest and suspense. Unless you're intimately familiar with Piaf's life, as well as the names of the people who surrounded her, you're almost sure to get lost. You know the feeling--'Wait, is that 1959 in New York or 1960 in Paris? Is that guy with the dark hair her lover, her accompanist, her manager, or all three?' After a while I just decided to lean back and enjoy the movie, and sort out the details later using Wikipedia.The soundtrack is, of course, wonderful. Piaf had real talent. That's clear to everyone who has heard her recordings (and clear to all the characters in the film as well). Most of the soundtrack doesn't utilize Piaf's voice--for reasons I don't understand--but the artist whose voice is used sounds amazingly like Piaf. You could enjoy this movie just for the music, even if you couldn't see it.Incidentally, for better or worse, the director has chosen to omit World War II from the movie. It just never happened, as far as the film is concerned. That's a pity, because Piaf was a true hero of the French Resistance.",8,1,2,8 July 2007
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Sense and Sensibility in Barcelona
","Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) was written and directed by Woody Allen. Allen's movies almost always feature a beautiful woman. This movie features three beautiful women, all of whom swirl around macho Javier Bardem. The plot reprises 'Sense and Sensibility.' Two friends visit Spain for the summer. Rebecca Hall, as Vicky, is reserved and cerebral. Scarlett Johansson as Cristina is outgoing and looking for adventure. They both get involved with Juan Antonio (Bardem), a brilliant painter and, no doubt, a brilliant lover. Into the mix Allen brings Penelope Cruz, Juan Antonio's ex-wife. She screams, she cries, she throws things. And yet, Juan Antonio can never really fall out of love with her.There's lots of hopping in and out of bed, and lots of talk about hopping in and out of bed. However, the picture is PG-13, so there's not much sex on screen. Instead there are great shots of Barcelona and the small city of Orviedo in Asturias. This film isn't much if you sit down and analyze it, but when you're watching it, it keeps your attention. I've never been wild about Scarlett Johansson as an actor, and Penelope Cruz relies too much on her beauty, and too little on her talent. However, I really admire Rebecca Hall whose tall elegance makes the other two women look tawdry.I saw this film on DVD, and it worked well. Note: there's a howler in the movie. Vicky is supposed to be doing graduate work on Catalan culture, but she doesn't speak Spanish. Allen could have pulled this off by saying, 'She only speaks Catalan.' He didn't bother. What is Vicky doing in the library when we see her with a book in her hand? Looking at the pictures?",7,0,3,22 December 2010
Moonrise Kingdom," Star-crossed lovers on a New England island
","Moonrise Kingdom (2012) was co-written and directed by Wes Anderson. This quirky, intelligent film doesn't represent reality, but it's a good-natured, funny movie about young love.Things I learned from this film: star-crossed lovers will always capture your attention and demand your affection; Bruce Willis can act when he's not playing a macho jerk; it's fun to see famous actors--Willis, Tilda Swinton, Bill Murray, and Frances McDormand--in a movie that gives them a chance to relax and have a good time; the young starring actor, Kara Hayward, is going to go on to great success on Broadway, and probably also in Hollywood.The plot involves young love that is thwarted, Boy Scouts (called 'Khaki Scouts' in the film), a terrible New England storm, and a married couple--Murray and McDormand--whose marriage has no more love or passion than their legal corporation has.Jared Gilman, who plays the male half of the star-crossed lovers, is a fine young actor who does an excellent job. However, in my mind, Kara Hayward is the actor to watch. Hayward is not drop-dead beautiful (unlike Elizabeth Taylor in 'National Velvet') but she has a quirky attractiveness combined with real acting talent. She is the next Emma Watson, and I think we'll be watching her on the screen again in the near future.Moonrise Kingdom is an interesting, unusual film that's worth seeing. Don't expect to see a masterpiece, but do expect to be entertained by a charming movie without a boring moment in it.P.S. Stay for the credits--the music that accompanies them is wonderful!",8,3,5,2 July 2012
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Harry Potter 7b
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011) was directed by David Yates. This film is wildly popular and is now ranked with the IMDb top 100 movies of all time. I can see why it's a box office hit. If you've read all the books, and seen the first seven movies, it's unthinkable not to see number eight. However, it's not clear to me why so many thousands of IMDb viewers rated the film as high as they did.The three main characters are there and--gasp--they've grown up. Emma Watson looks great in jeans, and Daniel Radcliffe needs to shave. Many of the 'dead' characters get to come back in dream sequences, so the excellent cast is complete. Ralph Fiennes is one of the world's great villains. Any movie that includes Helena Bonham Carter and Maggie Smith as supporting actors has to have something good going for it.Director Yates has faithfully followed J.K. Rowling's plot--no one really wants a different story or a different ending. In fact, Yates has improved upon the book by paring down Rowling's ill-conceived epilogue.If you want excitement, the movie is full of it. However, as a local Rochester reviewer pointed out, most of the action consists of people pointing wands at each other and firing away.If, unlikely as that may be, you haven't seen all the other films, I wouldn't bother with this one. If you're someone who has, indeed, seen all of the other films, then you must see this one. You won't be disappointed, but you won't be enlightened or surprised either.The Harry Potter series was successful, it was fun, and now it's over. It was a great ride while it lasted, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it. I'm just not sure that Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is one of the best 100 movies ever made.",7,1,2,27 July 2011
Ran," Kurosawa's masterpiece
","Ran (1985) written and directed by Akira Kurosawa, is one of the great movies of all time. I saw it when it was first released, and just saw it again when it was shown locally. It's one of those films that gets even better on a second viewing.This movie has been billed as the 'Japanese King Lear,' and that's fairly accurate. (However, the three children are sons in this version, not daughters.) However, in my opinion, the film is just as close to Shakespeare's 'Macbeth,' because much of the plot pivots around the actions of Lady Kaede, the wife of one of the sons.Lady Kaede, played by the renowned actor Mieko Harada, is intelligent, beautiful, and completely devoid of fear or kindness. She has a goal and she pursues it relentlessly throughout the film. It's only at the end that we understand the goal and her actions in pursuit of it.If you're a movie fan, you simply have to see Ran. It works much better on the large screen. (We were fortunate to see it at the excellent Dryden Theatre at Eastman House in Rochester.) However, if the only way to see it is on DVD, go with that. Just don't miss it!",10,1,4,4 October 2010
Inside Llewyn Davis," Not what folk music was about
","Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) was written and directed by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen.The film is about a struggling folk musician who can't support himself by singing. We're to assume that he's right at the brink of the folk revival of the 60's, and he's poised to become a star. All he has to do is earn enough money to survive until Bob Dylan and Joan Baez come along to make folk music profitable.The story doesn't work for me. In the first place, Llewyn (Oscar Isaac) isn't all that talented. (We heard folk music in Ann Arbor, NYC, and Newport in the 1960's, and Llewyn would have been considered OK, but nothing special). He doesn't appear to have any feel for the music in the sense of where it originated, who may have sung it before, and what historical significance it might have. He makes fun of an older folk singer, who may be meant to represent someone like Jean Ritchie from Kentucky. Urban folk musicians respected people who learned folk music through the oral tradition. They didn't make fun of them. (Anyway, as a performing artist, Llewyn should have realized how vicious it is to heckle an onstage performer.) Folk music in the 1960's was always allied with labor struggles, civil rights, and other progressive causes, but Llewyn appears apolitical. In the movie posters, he's shown carrying a cat. That makes us think that he may not have a place to sleep, but he's not going to abandon his cat. Actually, it's not his cat, and he does abandon it eventually.Finally, his behavior towards his sister is rotten, he betrays his best friend by having an affair with his friend's partner, and he's cruel to an older couple who try to help him.Even though the Coen brothers are talented directors, I don't see why people would enjoy a film about a low-talent, unlikeable loser. If you still want to see it, it will work well on DVD.P.S. This movie includes a road trip from NYC to Chicago. Note to Coen brothers: In 1961 the route between those two cities was not uncharted frontier territory. There were highways and expressways and people used them.",6,2,5,20 March 2014
Slumdog Millionaire," Did they see the same movie I saw?
","Slumdog Millionaire, directed by Danny Boyle, is a fairy tale about the obstacles to true love amidst the poverty of India. As I write this review, the movie has an average rating of 8.6, putting it in the top 250 movies of all time. All I can ask is, 'Why?'The movie has its strengths--Dev Patel, the male lead, is a good actor, and Freida Pinto, the female lead, is a beautiful woman who acts well enough. The film shows graphic, repeated images of ghastly poverty. If one picture is worth a thousand words, imagine what this film would be worth.Beyond those positive--or at least valuable--aspects, this film is mainly fantasy, interspersed with scenes of horrible violence, cruelty, and brutal torture. Don't go expecting a Bollywood production, and don't go expecting Cinderella, either. In fact, my advice would be, 'Don't go at all.'",6,3,12,27 December 2008
Macbeth," Very good version of a great play
","Macbeth (2015/I) was directed by Justin Kurzel. It stars Michael Fassbender as Macbeth, and Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth. This is a serious attempt to make a excellent movie from one of the world's greatest plays. It succeeds on some levels, and fails on other levels.Naturally, director Kurzel 'opens up' the drama by using shots of the barren moors and desolate shores of Scotland. He has chosen two highly talented actors to play Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. Fassbender is brilliant. I would never have thought of choosing Marion Cotillard as Lady Macbeth, but she's a great actor and she does a wonderful job. Kurzel's handling of the three weird sisters is outstanding, although for some reason he adds a young girl to the group. Some of the things I think Kurzel did wrong involve changing Shakespeare's play for--to me-- inexplicable reasons. For example, one of the great theatrical scenes in the world is Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Orson Welles got it wrong--the scene takes place in a shapeless, formless cave. (But Welles didn't have money for a proper set of a room within a castle.)Roman Polanski got it right--a room in a castle, with the maid and doctor in attendance. (OK--Lady Macbeth is nude, but the scene is played for madness, not sexuality.)Kurzel turns this great scene into a soliloquy. It doesn't work. This is an example of Shakespeare's genius betrayed. We need the maid and the doctor because someone has to witness the scene and recognize what Lady Macbeth is unwittingly telling us. Why change it when it works so well?Similarly, one of Shakespeare's most horrific scenes is the slaughter of MacDuff's family. This scene is perfect, and shouldn't be tampered with. Kurzel shows Lady MacDuff and two of her children captured, and then burned alive while MacBeth is watching. The scene as Shakespeare wrote it is fine the way it is--horrible but realistic. It has worked for 400 years. Who decided we needed something better?Finally, the sound quality was such that some of the dialog was unintelligible. Everyone has some trouble understanding some of Shakespeare's lines, but at least you should be able to hear them. (This wasn't just my problem. After the movie, several people commented about this, as did some reviewers.)We saw this film at Rochester's Little Theatre. It will work better on the large screen than the small screen. This version of Macbeth is certainly good enough to seek out and watch. I was frustrated because it came so close to being a historically important version, but didn't quite get there.",9,1,3,14 December 2015
The Simpsons Movie," Definitely not the Simpsons at their best
","The Simpsons Movie (2007), directed by David Silverman, is definitely not the Simpsons at their best. Most of the things that make the Simpsons great on TV--the throwaway gags, the multiple plots, the zingers sent at the Fox network and at the U.S. government, and the incredible cast of supporting characters--are missing from the movie.It's discouraging to realize how little David Silverman accomplished in the 87 minutes (basically four TV shows) with which he was able to work. Instead of giving us four times the fun, he gave us one quarter the fun. OK--the movie was overdue, and I guess any Simpsons movie is better than none, but this was an opportunity wasted.After watching the film, I tried to understand what went wrong. The biggest single problem, in my opinion, is that the plot was too linear. The director and screenwriters forgot that we don't want the Simpsons plot to go from A to B to C. We want it to start at A and go to Q and W before it gets to C, if it ever gets to C at all.Moreover, the movie makers chickened out. On TV they will take on any government institution. Here, the villainous government agency is the EPA. Plenty of government agencies are doing terrible things to the U.S., but I wouldn't exactly put the EPA at the top of the villain's list. As U.S. President, they chose a character meant to be Arnold Schwartzenegger. Now, there are plenty of ways to make fun of the Governor, but no one has suggested he's stupid and, furthermore, he's the one public character that can't become President. No real fun there. So, if you're a Simpsons fan, and you have to see the movie, be warned. If you're not a Simpsons fan, buy the Season I DVD. Then, once you're hooked, you can safely see the film.",6,2,2,1 January 2008
