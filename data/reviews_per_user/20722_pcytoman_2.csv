Hereditary," Overhyped , but a good slow burn horror
","As a fan of the horror genre, I had mixed feelings about Hereditary. I felt the critics that billed it as the next Exorcist for a new generation were off the mark somewhat. The way the movie ended wasn't really original, I had expected more. Overall, despite the ending, I still enjoyed this film. As for the pacing , I didn't have any issues with it. I didn't mind the fact it was a slow burn horror movie based on atmosphere and mood. Those who expect cheap jump scares will be disappointed.The acting was superb . Toni Collette's and Alex Wolff's performances were excellent. There are a few gruesome and creepy images that will stick with you.",8,2,6,10 June 2018
Mother!," Pretentious, Excessive, Pointless, and a Misfire
","This movie is a total misfire for Darren Aronofsky. I enjoyed his other works such as Requiem for a Dream and Black Swan. Unfortunately, Mother! is a total misfire. The film literally is just a hodgepodge of Biblical/Mother Earth allegories barely stitched together in an incoherent manner. The acting was serviceable. Some of the scenes were WTF , especially the one with an infant. How this film was able to get a wide studio release is beyond me. The marketing was misleading. This film should not be tagged as a horror film. The only real horror was how I lost 2+ hours watching this pretentious drivel.",2,1,2,10 June 2018
