"Run, Fat Boy, Run"," Bastardized, Americanized, Schwimmerized, Excuse Of A So-Called 'British' Comedy
","This film is an insult to the entire history of British comedy, and I'm mad at myself for wasting my time and money on this stupid little movie.This is the first British comedy - indeed, the fist 'British' film of any kind - I have ever walked out of. In fact, there are so many Americans involved in this movie that I'm not so sure it really is a British film. In any event, 30 minutes in and I just couldn't take it any more. If I had wanted to see a poorly written TV sitcom I could have stayed at home and rented an episode of 'Friends', the hardly humorous US TV show in which this movie's director, David Schwimmer, was an actor - an unfunny one, at that.Why in God's name would the maker's of this film have selected inexperienced American director Schwimmer, American writer Michael Black (Schwartz), and an American actor like Hank Azaria? Do they work on the cheap? Did they pay to participate? Were they hired in the hope of attracting an American audience? I can't imagine this film succeeding in Briain. Whatever the reason, they absolutely ruined the movie.This movie is so bad that the British Government should cancel Schwimmer's visa. He represents a clear and present danger to British culture. If Schwimmer and Schwartz ever again show up at a British Point of Entry they should be turned away immediately. Perhaps France would take them; they could say they're related to Jerry Lewis. And Simon Pegg and Dylan Moran should be hauled up in front of the actors' guild and chastised for participating in this affront to British comedy. They should be made to watch Ealing comedies until they return to their senses.There's not much left of the British Empire other than great wit. To lose that would constitute a crime against civilization.",1,12,26,5 April 2008
Angels & Demons," Multi, Multi Crappi
","What an awful piece of nothingness this movie turned out to be: an absolutely idiotic plot coupled with ridiculous dialog and totally uninteresting characters. As soon as I saw the name of 'writer' Akiva Goldsman in the credits I knew a large part of why this movie is such a turkey.Director Ron Howard has done a really poor job with this movie, providing nothing but 2 1/4 hours of police cars racing around Vatican City/Rome while searching for statues with their extended fingers seemingly exclaiming 'that-a-way'. What utter tripe.You can be sure that no one in any way associated with this lemon will be called up on stage during the next Academy Awards ceremony. In fact, the makers of this movie deserve to lose their shirts on it. I notice I've called this movie a 'turkey', 'tripe', and a 'lemon'. What it really is, though, is what comes out your end after you've consumed all that stuff.",1,8,31,25 May 2009
Mission: Impossible III," This Movie Is So Bad It's A Waste of Electricity.
","If you have spend any amount of money to watch this movie, be it for a ticket in a theater, to purchase the video, or even to provide electricity for your television, you will have wasted your money. And you most certainly will have wasted your time. The movie's that bad. But go ahead, it's your life.The fault lies not with the actors - everybody wants a paycheck - but with the idiocy of the movie itself. There is no plot - it's just the usual jumble of gunfire, explosions, and people jumping, shooting, talking on radios, flying in or being shot at by helicopters, drones, airplanes, etc. If I had to categorize it, I would say the movie's got a severe case of attention deficit disorder.Appallingly bad.",1,7,12,23 July 2006
Inglourious Basterds," One too many turns of the screw; and surprisingly pro-German.
","By far the most enjoyable thing about 'Inglourious Basterds' (sic, sic) are the performances by the cast of outstanding European actors. These Europeans really know their stuff. In fact, this film's real stars are the Europeans, especially Christoph Waltz from Austria and Melanie Laurent from France. Their performances are wonderful. As for top-billed Brad Pitt, he has only a supporting role as Tarantino's 21st Century stand-in for Lee Marvin. Pitt may be the star on the marquis, but he's far from being the star of this film.Some reviewers here seem to think the movie is anti-German. I can't imagine how they can possibly think that. Perhaps the bravest man in the whole film is a captured German soldier who courageously chooses death before dishonor. Sure, there are the usual Teutonic sadists and pigs, but on the level of plain soldiers, both sides seem to be more or less equal in executing their inglorious duties. In fact, in their manner of carrying out their parts in total war, the Americans and British in this film don't seem much of a step up from their German enemies. Indeed, these irregulars of the OSS and SOE employ many of the same methods used by their Nazi opponents: torture, threats of retaliation against families, etc. Is it possible for a particular group of sadists to claim the high moral ground? Despite the excellent acting, and superb photography and costuming, this film eventually disappoints. The last 1/4 of the film descends into the realm of pure nonsense, fantasy and ludicrous, contrived situations: a country bumpkin milkmaid becomes a cinema owner; dozens of the Reich's highest ranking officials and officers gather in a hostile city with barely a guard in sight. That's so ludicrous that anyone from the Secret Service watching this film would have tears of laughter rolling down his or her cheeks. Just like a person who always gives a screw one too many turns and breaks something, director Tarantino just doesn't know how to leave well enough alone or quit when he is ahead. Like a child, he insists on demonstrating how much he knows (or thinks he knows) about movies and their history, and so he winds up damaging his own movie. With his in-jokes and his sly aural and visual references to other films and their makers Tarantino wants to impress us, but he really only manages to foul his own work. I know who Aldo Ray was; I've seen him and the late, great Lee Marvin. Is Tarantino trying to impress me with the fact that he knows them, too? The very talented Tarantino should spend less time being referential and reverential, and more time mastering his movie-making skills.",7,9,20,21 August 2009
The Other Boleyn Girl," Excruciatingly Dull Costume Drama. And did I say dull?
","Bana, Johannson, Portman: what a waste of acting talent there is in this dullfest called 'The Other Anne Boleyn.' The cinematography was muted, washed out, and dull. The music was, if anything, even duller. The dialog seemed straight out of a high school drama class.How dull was it? I fell asleep twice, only to be woken up by a poke on the arm. Man, was it boring.As far as I am concerned, the only positive aspect of the movie comes from stimulating my interest in finding out more about the Boleyn girls. I should have stayed home and read the Wikipedia entries instead of actually going to see a dramatization of their lives in this film.",5,3,5,14 March 2008
Black Book," A Very Good Film, But Ruined For Me In The Last 5 Seconds
","Why on earth the makers of this film decided to insert a not-so-subtle political message into the very last few seconds of what was otherwise a very good film is a complete mystery to me. It absolutely ruined the film for me. Instead of staying to watch the credits roll I just picked up and left, muttering 'how could they do that.' I haven't read any other reviews on these pages, so I'm curious to find out if anyone else had the same reaction. The scene is only a few seconds long, so maybe nobody else cares. Guess I'll find out.The story line of Black Book is very interesting, if somewhat convoluted, artificial and overly coincidental. While the German military men are drawn too broadly - surely they can't all be Lumpen-Nazis, - at least members of the Dutch Resistance are given some depth of character development. They, of course, are at the heart of the story. Some of the Dutch are in the Resistance, some others are German collaborators, and most, I expect, just want the war to end. The dance between the amateurs of the Resistance who are trying to play the Germans and the professional Germans who are obviously playing the Resistance is very well done. Sometimes in the film it's difficult to tell who the good guys really are, but in war I expect there are no totally good guys.While I did appreciate the story line, it is actress Clarice Van Houten who positively shines in the film. She brightens every scene. Halina Rijn was fine, too, but her part was relatively small. Unfortunately, for the male lead I'm afraid I'm pretty well bored with German actor Sebastian Koch. This is the second film I've seen recently in which he plays a 'sensitive' German (the other film being the wonderful 'Lives of Others' about the East German STASI.) If you like movies with a war and a counter-intelligence theme Black Book is for you. Not the best kind of its genre ever made, but certainly a film of much quality and substance.",7,3,5,26 May 2007
Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy," Compares poorly with the brilliant 1979 British television version
","I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this 2011 version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy with Gary Oldman, but when it finally arrived I was so disappointed that I considered leaving the theater shortly after the movie began. I didn't, but I should have.To be fair to this current film, I admit that I have seen the British TV series version with Alec Guinness many times, so perhaps I'm merely biased. Frankly, though, - and despite the wonderful reviews of this film from many people - I don't see how anyone can take this dull, lifeless version seriously.The acting in this film runs the entire gamut from A to B. Gary Oldman is no Alec Guinness. For all the taciturnity of his George Smiley, Guinness imbued his Smiley with genuine character, whereas Oldman is reduced to maintaining a stone-faced, unemotional countenance for the entire 2 hours 40 minutes duration of this film. Much has been made of Oldman's not saying a word in the first 18 minutes of the film, but this can be easily matched by some characters who had barely a sentence of two in the whole production. The usually formidable actor Ciaran Hinds must not have had more than 10 words total, and they were of absolutely no consequence. Academy Award winner Colin Firth had barely more to say, and I doubt if his role in the film contained even a whole page of dialog. Compare that to the brilliant 1979 performance in that role by the late Ian Richardson. The only character in this film who exuded any sense of real life was that of Jim Prideaux, played by Mark Strong. But Strong was not allowed to be anywhere near as 'strong' as that of the character played in 1979 by the late Ian Bannen.If I had not seen the earlier British television series I honestly doubt if I would have been able to follow the plot of this current movie. The film is dark, the characters rather dull, and flashbacks abound. I really believe the makers of this film expect viewers to already know the plot before arriving in the theater.I have other quibbles. This film has the headquarters of MI-6 located in what looks to be a former warehouse. Inasmuch as MI-6 is an arm of the U. K. Foreign Office, are we expected to believe that the elite of the British intelligence establishment would be housed in those dark, dank conditions? And would spies work in an open office environment with no privacy? Hard to believe.If you go to this film I hope you enjoy it. But I'd also recommend you get a DVD of the 1979 British TV series in which the acting, atmosphere, locations, and music are all far superior to this current version of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier Spy.",3,53,93,7 January 2012
Ocean's Thirteen," A Gold-Plated Cow Patty.
","'Ocean's Thirteen' is a glitzy, gaudy joke. Unfortunately for the audience, though, the joke is on them. I have felt more self-respect after visiting gypsy fortune tellers than I have after seeing this pile of glamorous, conceited, nothing. An Alka-Seltzer has more substance to it than this movie.Undoubtedly, fewer and fewer people are going to remember that this movie is based on the 1960's Las Vegas so-called 'Rat Pack' of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis, Jr., comedian Joey Bishop, and actor Peter Lawford. For all their talents, all of them were on the down-side of their careers, some sliding faster than others. Considerations of money aside, once you reach Vegas your creative career is over. Next stop, Atlantic City. The Rat Pack were famous for being famous, and everything they did was some sort of unfunny in-joke. Nevertheless, the one positive thing you can say about them is that they were who they were.With the Ocean's Thirteen bunch, though, they are not who they are. George Clooney may appeal to many people, but no one can accuse him of having a surfeit of talent. Brad Pitt and Matt Damon are still decent actors, but you'd never know it from the roles they play in this piece of self-centered fluff. One of them should have given up his role to Ben Affleck, an actor much more suited to the vapidity of these roles. And to see Al Pacino in this film is practically a national tragedy.Mostly, though, I'm mad at myself for ignoring my movie instincts and for joining my fellow movie-going lemmings in donating money to the makers of this idiotic enterprise. See, the joke is on me.",4,17,33,10 June 2007
Lost in Translation," An Intelligent American Movie
","Lost In Translation, set in gloriously neon-lit Tokyo, is a film about the universal human condition, the search for meaning, friendship, love.  A beautiful, intelligent, sophisticated young woman (Scarlett Johansson) feels utterly neglected by her husband after only two years of marriage when she encounters a jaded, resigned, middle-aged, American movie star (Bill Murray) in a hotel in Tokyo.  To a great extent these two people represent the book ends of married life, the woman just starting out in her marriage, the man married for many years.  Despite their age difference there is a marvelous chemistry between the two that is quite powerful, and it is the frustrations and disappointments of their respective situations - which is really the same situation - that draws our empathy and understanding.  These two people are real, not perfect.  There is a lot of very good humor in the film, too, and Murray's scene on an exercise machine in the hotel health club is priceless.  It's truly wonderful to see such a fine quality film made in America.",Null,0,0,28 September 2003
The Bourne Ultimatum," A Movie With Severe Attention-Deficit Disorder.
","The Bourne Ultimatum is a series of non-stop action sequences uninterrupted by anything resembling serious thought. Like going to a car dealership and being subjected to the non-stop prattle of an aggressive salesman, the loud, throbbing music and the many scenes filmed with a hand-held, jiggly camera are designed to dazzle the viewer without providing any real information at all. After the first two Bourne films, this one is a massive, action-filled, letdown.If you swallow the movie's premise, the CIA/NSA types have total control over all surveillance cameras anywhere on Earth, and the hero knows all passwords, telephone numbers, and codes to every telecommunications device every made. This is the modern equivalent of the old cowboy movies in which they could fire hundreds of bullets from their six-shooters and never have to stop and reload. Oops, there I go thinking again.Sure, I did find parts of the film entertaining, but more of it was like a cartoon with Wiley Coyote chasing the Roadrunner. I've had Chinese dinners with more substance than this movie.",5,4,11,4 August 2007
Radio," Good Movie, Great Cast
","I hadn't especially wanted to see this film, but now that I have I'm very glad I did.  It was the strong ensemble acting that did it for me.  Ed Harris and Cuba Gooding, Jr. were both superb in the leading roles. Frankly, I don't know which one is supposed to be the 'star' of the film, which I think is a testament to the powerful work of both actors.  They were both superb.  In addition to those performances it was wonderful to see the performances of the rest of the cast, especially those of Chris Mulkey, S. Epatha Merkerson, and Alfre Woodard.  As I watched the film I tried to forget about the characters the actors were playing and concentrate a bit on the quality of the acting itself.  All I can say is that these people are true professionals and that their effort was practically 'British' in its ensemble workmanship.",Null,0,0,31 October 2003
Little Miss Sunshine," A Good Movie That Could Have Been A Great Movie
","'Little Miss Sunshine' is a movie that gave me a lot of laughs, especially at the beginning of the film, but the laughs slowly but surely became fewer and fewer as the movie progressed. I've decided to blame this on Alan Arkin - because his part wasn't big enough! His scatological grandfather role was the brightest spot in the whole film.The whole cast was very good, but as good an actor as Greg Kinnear is, he seems to be type-cast as an irritating schlemiel with a victim mentality whom you'd just love to throttle. Greg's characters always have 'Kick Me' taped to the backs of their shirts, and if you've seen him with Jack Nicholson in 'As Good As It Gets' or with Pierce Brosnan in 'The Matador' you'll know what I mean. Tony Collette was excellent as Kinnear's harried wife. She's so real I could swear I've actually seen her character on the street.The writing was really one of the highlights of the film; after all, if there were no the humor in the writing there'd be no funny lines to deliver. Paul Dano was fine as the family's anguished teenage son, but the humor in his character really comes from the mouths of the writers.Despite the raves you'll read on this web site - and the huge line of folks waiting to get into the theater - the film seemed to lose steam as it went along, with pathos supplanting much of the humor. By 2/3 of the way through the movie the star of the film seemed to be the VW bus the family was traveling in. So, good writing and a lot of laughs; but ultimately the film is missing something - not enough Alan Arkin.",8,0,6,20 August 2006
Salt," Juvenile Fantasy
","'Salt' is pretty much a nothing film. It is full of irrational action, though, and that does appeal to much of the movie-going public. Does any of it make sense? No. Does anybody care that it makes no sense? Probably not.Here's something else that needs to be said: Angelina Jolie is not an especially attractive woman. She's not. She has unusual facial features, but that's about it. That, and she's a 'celebrity.As opposed to that other terrible 'spy' movie that's making the rounds right now ('The American', with George Clooney), 'Salt' at least has a plot, totally nonsensical that it is. So that's what it comes down to for summer 2010 films, a movie with absolutely no plot or a movie with an absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical plot. And the winner is ...",2,1,4,18 September 2010
Silver Linings Playbook," Unconventional, But Could Have Been Ripped From Today's News
","For one reason or another I don't see many movies these days, so I had never seen or heard of the two primary actors in this movie, Bradley Cooper and the beautiful Jennifer Laurence. Watching them on screen in this movie, though, has truly been eye opening. They are both brilliant, if not totally realistic, in this film in their depiction of mentally ill people trying to return to 'normalcy.' The only actor I recognized immediately was Robert DeNiro, and his performance was, I think, his best in may years. The supporting actors in the cast were also uniformly good, especially Chris Tucker. Severe mental illness and other neuroses are not a laughing matter, but this film uses fantastic humor to bring those problems to our attention. And that mentally ill people - rather beautiful people in this film - need love as much, if not more, that the rest of us is something to think about. Despite the subject matter, this is still a romantic comedy. It's poignant as well as terrifically funny. Go see it.",9,2,5,31 December 2012
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," High school locker room stuff.
","This is a pretty lame role for an actor who is constantly touted as the latest and greatest comedian around. Well, he ain't. Rather, Steve Carrell is apparently the beneficiary of the halo effect because of his association with the Comedy Channel's 'The Daily Show with Jon Stewart.' The Daiy Show is great; this movie isn't. Every time I see Carrell on television or in movies he isn't very sharp; he continues that level of sub-par performance in this movie.Basically, this is slapstick, high school locker room stuff for the post-high school crowd. An endless supply of crotch and titty jokes, none of them especially funny. Despite some good performances and a couple of funny lines by Carrell's supporting actors the whole premise of this movie is dull stuff; if you've seen the previews you've already seen the good parts of the film.How bad is this film? Well, I walked out after about an hour; I just couldn't waste any more time on it or Steve Carrell.",2,5,14,17 September 2005
Batman Begins," A Very Good Batman. In fact, the best Batman yet.
","No movie is perfect, but this is certainly one heck of a good Batman. What is especially impressive is the intergenerational viewpoint of the director. I normally do not seek out, or even notice, references to other films when going to a movie, but I thought I detected visual references to Clockwork Orange in some of the scenes with Liam Neeson. Perhaps I'm just imagining it, though Christopher Nolan's biography on IMDb.COM indicates that he's a big fan of Stanley Kubrick, the director of Clockwork Orange.I was impressed by the subtle and somewhat more intellectual underpinnings of the film than what one might expect from a summer blockbuster. To bring a political quotation into this review, it's as if Nolan had taken to heart FDR's famous dictum that there is 'nothing to fear but fear itself.' If anything, the fight against fear is at least as important in the film as the fight against evil. That, in fact, seems to be the source from which Batman draws his strength in his fight against evil. The evil in the film is not just of the black and white variety either, but occupies a much grayer area. Official corruption, poverty, and the misuse of psychiatry (a la the Soviet Union's Serbsky Clinic, perhaps) are elements seamlessly blended in with the obvious evil of old-fashioned Gotham gangsterism. This is quite a heady diet for a summer blockbuster film, I'd say.Christian Bale is a fine Batman, and his supporting actors are as good as one could hope for, especially the wonderful Michael Caine as Alfred the Butler and Liam Neeson as Batman's mentor. Tom Wilkinson, too, is very believable as a Gotham godfather, and Rutger Hauer seems to be a perfect fit for the director of Wayne family business.This movie seems, therefore, to have it all: a good story, fine actors, and, if you are of a mind to entertain them, some deeper questions about what really constitutes good and evil.The darkness and themes of the movie may be too strong for children younger than 11-12 years old, I think, but for everyone else looking for a good summer movie I'd very much recommend it.",8,1,2,19 June 2005
Revolutionary Road," Most of us live on Revolutionary Road
","I could watch the wonderful Kate Winslett read a cook book aloud and not be bored, but what's the purpose of this film? I would imagine 7 out of 10 Americans live in one way or another on their own version of Revolutionary Road. When there's no particular struggle to obtain food or shelter one is left pondering the meaning of life and why one is so dissatisfied with one's lot. It's the middle class curse.There is nothing special about this film or, I expect, the book on which it is based. For many, the American Dream is just a long, dull, pointless exercise on a treadmill while waiting for the inevitable. What's the point of seeing it played out in a film? Does the filmmaker think we're not aware of all this?",3,19,34,14 March 2009
The Bourne Legacy," Car chases and foot races, we've seen this all before.
","Car chases and foot races; boring! we've seen it in dozens of other movies - since the 1930's at least (when they were better done.) I swear that whole scenes in this movie have been lifted from other films. Merely having a few good actors (Renner, Weisz, Norton) in the movie cannot turn this sow's ear into a silk purse. Watching this film wasn't even painless (especially a mass murder scene that could have been lifted directly from today's headlines), but it most definitely was brainless. It also seems to have been made with a sharp eye on its budget. It's just less expensive to shoot parts of the film in an East Asian slum. And why is the great actor Albert Finney making a cameo appearance in this movie. Is he doing someone a favor, or is he down and out? I wonder what they are going to call the next sequel in this series, 'The Bourne Repetition'?",4,4,11,12 August 2012
Hero," The Real Message of This Chinese Film: Individualism Must Be Crushed
","HERO is a visually satisfying film - glorious colors, diaphanous, flowing garments, exotic scenery, and some of the best - if not the best - computer-enhanced sword fighting scenes ever filmed. The film even purports to have a spiritual message of sorts: that renunciation of violence and a yielding to the will of the King is the road to happiness - how Gandhi-like, but how strange when coming from the Chinese. However, there is a darker message here, too.If you look at the real philosophy behind this film it is this: no matter how justified the cause, no matter how heroic the individuals, the state must ultimately triumph in order to secure a greater good for all. Individualism must be crushed, no matter how heroic it may seem. As incongruous as it may seem when attending this kind of fantasy film, watching this movie's army of ancient Chinese archers flooding the skies with tens of thousands of well-aimed arrows - and a spectacular sight it is, too - brings immediately to mind the current Chinese Communist regime's threat to rain down a flood of missiles on Taiwan, should that island insist on declaring its total independence from China. Gee, I hadn't expected to be inundated with political thoughts when I went to see this movie, but I just couldn't avoid it. Show the courage of the students in Tien An Men Square and the King or State will reward you with the glorious death you apparently so yearn for. And all this is packaged in a film that is supposed to be an ancient martial arts fantasy.Frankly, despite the wonderful sound track of the film and the fantastic scenes of sword-fighters flying through the air, I think that this film doesn't compare entirely well with its famous predecessor, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. HERO is just a bit too good in the computer department; a but too slick. Still, it's a very impressive film, indeed. Perhaps even more impressive is to see a packed theater of average American movie-goers watching almost two hours of a sub-titled Chinese Mandarin film. For me, that is the most amazing thing of all. Finally, let me criticize the theater in which I saw this film, the Silverado in San Antonio, Texas. The film was entirely too dark, and those glorious colors in the film were nowhere near as brilliant and bright as they should have been. At times the films sets were so dark as to be almost black along the edges of the screen. I know the film was not made this way, and I can only assume that the management of the theater is using bulbs of too low a wattage in their projector. It took the pleasure out of what should have been a visually glorious film.",6,1,1,27 August 2004
Into the Wild," A Great 'Road Film'
","This is one of the best 'road' films you're likely ever to see.What this road film shows us in depth, unlike others of its type, is that while youth are on the road trying to discover the meaning of life there are concerned parents, relatives, and friends left behind who worry day and night about them. Looking at two earlier road films: the 60's classic 'Easy Rider' and the modern road film 'The Motorcycle Diaries', one can see that only 'Into The Wild' emphasizes that there are more people in a person's story than just one's own heroic self.'Into The Wild' wonderfully depicts the naive, but well-intentioned, egocentricity of Chris McCandless (superbly played by Emile Hirsch), a young man who is practically the very definition of high-minded youth. In his search of self-discovery this young man inflicts the pain of loss on almost everyone he meets. I think he knows this, but he's not about to let it deter him from punching his ticket of self-discovery on his way to manhood. I think he also knows that he might be biting off more than he can chew, but to his credit he doesn't let that deter him from his quest. Like most his age, he tends to think he's immortal. He will soon discover otherwise when he reaches the northern wilderness.It may seem incongruous, but Chris reminded me of some of the Carthusian monks depicted in the recent film 'Into Great Silence.' They too were on a journey of discovery, but in monastic cells rather than in the Alaskan wilderness. In reality, though, I think the two journeys aren't all that different. The one is fraught with physical danger, the other with spiritual hazards. The old British expression says that it's not whether you win or lose, but how you play the game. Perhaps in the eyes of many Chris McCandless did not win the game, but there's no doubt he played it very well. As portrayed in this film, he is someone we can all be very proud of.",8,2,5,20 October 2007
The Last Samurai," Cowboys and Indians a la Japonnaise
","I had earlier decided to give The Last Samurai a pass, inasmuch as I just couldn't imagine baby-faced Tom Cruise as a Samurai.  However, after reading some reviews on these pages which indicated that the movie was not at all bad, I changed my mind and went to see it.  I should have stuck with my original plan.For all the beauty of the scenery, this movie is nothing but a rehash of the old cowboys and Indians formula:  Enlightened blue-eyed white man savem backward brown-skinned - but noble - natives.  Apparently this movie's makers had seen, and were impressed by, both 'A Man Called Horse' with Richard Harris and 'Little Big Man' with Dustin Hoffman.  Unfortunately, this film is not in any way in the same league with those earlier films.  To be more specific:  the dialog was puerile, the characterizations were stereotypical, and the casting was bizarre.  Oh, well, at least none of the Japanese were made to say, 'rots of ruck.'  I've always like British actor Timothy Spall, especially in the wonderful 'Auf Wiedersehn, Pet' series, but he's horribly miscast as the British trade representative to Japan.   When he refers to an idea as 'capital' his pronunciation is enough to make one laugh - but this isn't a comedy.  And speaking of comedy, the great comedian Billy Connolly has a smallish role in this film, but rather than being a Scot he plays an Irishman in the U.S. Cavalry.  So, instead of hearing his delightful Glaswegian accent we are given him putting on an Irish brogue.  Perhaps the director thought that if Billy were to speak with his natural voice he'd steal the whole movie right there and then.  And, despite the good words on these pages, I found actor Ken Watanabe's portrayal of the Last Samurai as believable as I did that of David Carradine playing the monk on the 'Kung Fu' television series. 
Anyway, not everyone will share my opinion of this film.  I actually heard someone sniffling and blowing her teary nose behind me in the theater, so I guess she was somehow moved by the film.  I was a bit moved, too, so just before they rolled the credits I left my seat in order to be first in line at the loo.",Null,1,2,1 January 2004
Inside Man," Good Police Thriller with Excellent Acting.
","It's obvious that Spike Lee is fixated on the subject of race and culture, even in this, his most commercial venture. The film has a great multi-cultural sound track and the movie is populated with the racial and ethnic rainbow that makes up NYC: blacks, Jews, Sikhs, Hispanics, and lots and lots of white folk. Lee even works in an Albanian. Lee is more upfront on how these people all relate to each other in the American melting pot than most other directors. At one point, when interviewing a Sikh who complains of discrimination at airports, Denzel Washinton's character tells him: 'But I'll bet you have no trouble getting a cab.' This real-life stuff is priceless.The story line - the caper - is rather mysterious for a great part of the film, and in the end it's rather a disappointment, if not altogether preposterous. Nevertheless, it's still a film with a lot of atmosphere and with very good acting performances, especially by Denzel Washinton. Here he is is not the pretty-boy Denzel of past years, but a middle-aged, roly-poly NYC detective who's obviously cut a few corners in his life. If this film weren't so colorful it would have made a wonderful film-noir.",8,3,4,26 March 2006
The Da Vinci Code," Simultaneously Boring and Preposterous!
","What in heaven's name could director Ron Howard have been smoking when he made this turkey. Akiva Goldsman should be banned from ever writing another screenplay. What a joke it is, and how unutterably dull and uninteresting this whole movie is. Howard has not only ruined whatever there was in the book which made it one of the best sellers of all time, he has even managed to ruin scenes of Paris and London! That's almost impossible to do, but Howard has pulled it off. How bad was this movie? Well, at one point I was laughing out loud at the serious parts, that's how bad. At another point it struck that Howard was stealing scenes from 'Sean of the Living Dead', a movie that is far better than Howard's Turkey.As for the actors, Tom Hanks was extraordinarily dull. Jean Reno was, if anything, even worse - and I'm a Jean Reno fan! He brings new meaning to the word 'boring.' I can only fault Ian McKellen for not having taken one of his walking stick props and beating Hanks, Reno, and especially Howard half to death. Audrey Tatou was an inoffensive cipher. She needs to return to France and leave Hollywood as far behind as possible. Paul Bettany's career is on the inevitable artistic downhill now that he's involved with Hollywood. It's bizarre, but like many Brits he insists on blowing off any attempt at artistry the second he get a whiff of Uncle Sam's greenbacks. Enjoy the cash, Paul.Hey, buy the book. It's not great, but it's not a totally bad read. But avoid the movie like the plague. If the Christian protesters ever find out how bad this movie is they'll be encouraging people to see it! Now that's bad.",1,1,9,20 May 2006
Mr. & Mrs. Smith," Stupid, Nonsensical, Idiotic, Plot less, Juvenile, and Borrrrring
","What a waste of my time and money it was to see this flic. Absolutely the only - and I mean only - redeeming feature of this film is that it did provide a period of employment for the participants, i.e., carpenters, costumers, drivers, et al. Whatever the actors and director were paid was far too much. Apparently Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie think that they have such great name recognition that they can afford to appear in whatever garbage will give them the biggest paycheck. I hope they're right, because this poor excuse for a movie could be a career-ender. Subtract the explosions, noise and pyrotechnics from this movie and there is nothing left but really stupid dialog between two people who apparently think they're God's gift to the 15-year old set. I hope this movie was made on cellulose film so that it will eventually decay in the can. I'd hate to think Jolie and Pitt would want this crap to be part of their careers' legacy.",3,35,74,11 June 2005
The Departed," Brilliant!
","What an amazing film The Departed is! The story is so riveting it's almost Shakespearean, and if this film is an adaptation of a Chinese film, it is nevertheless all American. Screenwriter William Monahan has breathed the essence of Irish-Catholic South Boston grit into it. A magnificent achievement.And the actors! They are uniformly marvelous. Martin Sheen, Alec Baldwin, and Mark Wahlburg are perfect as plain-clothes detectives of the Massachusetts State Police, and Ray Winstone is wonderfully cast as the criminal chief's right hand man. As anyone will know who has seen the excellent Aussie film The Proposition, Winstone is an actor's actor. All of these actors get better year by year. How great it is to see actors of this quality achieving higher and higher artistry. The character actors of the Irish gang are outstanding, too, radiating extreme menace beneath that natural Irish charm.Vera Farmiga's performance is, in my opinion, worthy of an Oscar. Playing a state psychologist who falls under the spell of both Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon she is radiates vulnerability and intelligence. When she is in a scene with either of those men all eyes are on HER.The leads in this film, Jack Nicholson, DiCaprio, and Damon demonstrate that a film of this great quality can accommodate all three of these immensely talented actors. These review pages will be full of well-deserved praise for all three of them, but forget anything you read about Nicholson chewing the carpet. He is perfect: he is the boss, what he says goes, and he leaves no one in any doubt about that. No other actor could have brought his level of passion, intensity, and - yes - humor to the part. Director Martin Scorsese was right to let Jack run with the role. It will rank up there with - and possibly exceed - even the work of Brando and De Niro.Damon and DiCaprio reach new heights in their performances. They've always been very, very good, but now they're both verging on greatness. They don't deserve to be lumped together, but when they're roles are so similar - the two faces of Janus - one can't help but remark on how similar their accomplishments are in this film. The intense, crusading Irishman of DiCaprio versus the glib, charming, shape-shifting hypocrisy of Damon. Two halves of the same Irish-Catholic coin. And we are the richer for it.I know nothing about directing, but if it's Scorsese who's brought all this together and who's created what is bound to be a classic American film then he will truly deserve every accolade he gets for this fantastic film. Like Woody Allen, maybe Scorsese is too 'New York' for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, but no one has ever deserved an Academy Award for a film more than Martin Scorsese does for The Departed.",8,0,1,8 October 2006
Wedding Crashers," Old retired military guy finds this movie to be very, very funny.
","First, a mild warning to those who automatically find all references to sex to be gross and offensive - this movie is full of those moments. It's a very funny movie, but just from reading these reviews I know that not everyone will appreciate it. So, be forewarned. Likewise, for some of those thin-skinned folks - many of whom are probably veterans-groupies who might themselves never have served a day in uniform - who object to a 10-second scene in which the boys talk about using Purple Heart medals to impress women, my advice would be to calm down and just keep saying, 'It's only a movie.' As a retired military man myself I found absolutely nothing to object to. It's a movie!As has been commented on elsewhere, this really is a 'guy movie', but what's to prevent a woman from liking a guy movie? Nothing. A good laugh is a good laugh. Even though I'd never especially cared for Owen Wilson, and had never even heard of Vince Vaughn, I enjoyed them both in this flic. As has been pointed out over and over, they have very good chemistry together.These two guys have only one goal: by attending weddings uninvited to eat as much free food, to drink as much free drink, to bed as many women, and to have as good a time as possible. Like it or not, this is almost the definition of young men! These two laugh, they spread good cheer, they hurt no one. These guys love life. The writing is very good, the actors and actresses are superb. The laughs are there aplenty. So what's not to like? I recommend it highly. And this from a guy who will never see 60 again.",8,1,4,31 July 2005
Shooter," Nonsensical, Unreal, Stupidly Cartoonish, and Insultingly Idiotic
","'The Shooter' is an extraordinarily disappointing excuse for a movie. In fact, it's so unbelievable that it wouldn't make a good Saturday morning cartoon despite the fact that all the characters are outlandishly cartoonish. The whole film seems to have drawn heavily from the far better done vigilante movies of Charles Bronson. As an armed avenging angel, mumbling Mark Wallberg is certainly no Charles Bronson. Not even close. The cartoonish and stereotypical supporting players are no great shakes, either, but the idiotic story line really doesn't give them much to work with. I had to laugh, though, when I saw short, fat Ned Beatty in the role of a US Senator and wondered if the movie's makers chose him for his uncanny facial resemblance to one of our former Secretaries of State. If so, I'm sure the former Secretary will not be all that pleased.By far the only good feature of this movie is its cinematography. It's good to see Philadelphia for a change, a city not featured all that often in films; and the scenery in the mountainous far west is beautiful and spectacular.Thinking about how awful this film is, I've only just realized that for years now explosions and gunfire have taken the place of yesteryear's car chases and demolition derbies in Hollywood's bag of action film stereotypes. I guess when you're making really stupid movies all you can really fall back on to get the audience's attention are explosions. If you can't dazzle 'em with brilliance, baffle 'em with blasts.Pyrotechnics aside, most of 'The Shooter' is just a dismal dud.",4,4,9,27 March 2007
Tae Guk Gi: The Brotherhood of War," TAE GUK GI: The Yin and Yang of Movie-making
","TAE GUK GI: The Brotherhood of War contains not only some of the most effective images of war over filmed, but also some of the most stereotypical elements of movie-making.First, the positive elements in this film. The scenes of combat are absolutely extraordinary. This is not your typical Hollywood sanitization of mutilation, death, and destruction. In this film the flesh and bone explode, metal fragments rip to pieces anything they touch, and dirt and rock fragments cover and lacerate everyone and everything. The realism of these scenes is astonishing.It is also unique that the film depicts the horrors that both sides perpetrate on each other; both the North Koreans and South Koreans execute even their own civilians. Men, women, (and maybe children, too) are summarily murdered for politics, even if those politics were forced upon the populace by the enemy. This is total war between political ideologies; war without mercy. I can almost guarantee that this film could not have been made in South Korea during the years of the Pak Chung Hee dictatorship of the 1970's.This film also portrays the heroism and fear of the infantry soldiers who must run into a storm of fire, metal, and explosive death, sometimes willingly, but often because their own officers and sergeants will kill them if they don't. This may be the Korean War of the 1950's, but it could just as easily have been the trench warfare of World War I. Just as bad, the film reveals that the military on both sides sanctions, tolerates, and even encourages the brutalization and murder of Prisoners of War, civilian hostages, and just ordinary people. (Sound familiar? Ever hear of someone on the winning side of a war ever being charged with a war crime? It wasn't likely then and, as we know, it isn't likely now.) However, in contrast to the stunning battle scenes and the film's exposure of the horrors of war, the film also contains some really lackluster elements, especially in the musical score. The music is just Hollywood-style, manipulative, tearjerker stuff. The movie would have benefited from less music and by music that was more subdued and transparent. The movie also suffers from - at least to my western eyes - a soap opera quality in the relationship between the two brothers who are the main protagonists of the film. In the first place, I think the actor Won Bin was too 'mature' (in his mid-20's or so) to play the 18-year old schoolboy younger brother. This is somewhat mitigated later in the film, as the horrors of war tend to age everyone involved. Secondly, there was too much speechifying between the brothers. Every one of their meetings seemed too dramatic, if not histrionic. Toward the end of the movie the histrionics bled over from the merely verbal and spread into the previously excellent action scenes. There seemed to be a palpable shift from the very plausible to the rather unlikely.All in all, though, this is a very worthwhile film. It's eye-opening about war, provides insights into brutality that many of the powers that be would rather we not have, and evokes in us feelings of anger and sadness. This Korean-made film is a very fine effort.",7,3,4,1 June 2008
The Blind Side," 'Hoop Dreams' it ain't.
","Whatever the real story behind the film story of this movie (i.e., upper middle-class white family taking in and propelling a poor - but physically massive - black youth to football success) I didn't especially care for the film. One should read the book of the Blind Side to get the real story that sparked this movie.As for the movie, itself, it seems to be from the same attitude that brought us 'Ozzie and Harriet', as well as 'Father Knows Best', on TV in the 50's and early 60's when white people ruled the earth. This current movie, though, is not about those TV families. It's really about the White, Southern, God of high-school football, and if it takes a hulking, disadvantaged black boy to keep that image of God going, then so be it.For a less romanticized, but more objective, view of disadvantaged black athletes in a white, Christian, school environment you should compare this movie with the classic movie 'Hoop Dreams' (reviewed in IMDb at: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110057/) I'm very glad to see Sandra Bullock win awards for her performance in this film, but keep in mind the awards are for her, not for this movie.",6,4,6,24 January 2010
Saints and Soldiers," Mormom Proselytizing Disguised As A War Movie
","OK, let me begin by saying that 'Saints and Soldiers' isn't really a bad film. It's merely deceptive and - because of that - dishonest.I got suckered into seeing this film by my careless reading of a movie review by well-know columnist Roger Ebert. If he had been open enough - or aware enough - to disclose the movie's obvious Mormon content I would not have spent my money to take the family to see it. When I think about it, of course, I should have understood the tip-off given by the use of the word 'saints' in the title. Not only that, but I was once before taken in by one of these Mormon-message films at this same theater. Either the theater management is Mormon, or they are trying to attract Mormon patron dollars. I think it's the former.In any event, once in the theater it soon became apparent that something was amiss with the film. The American soldiers in the film were in a platoon that could not exist outside the state of Utah.Look at the star ratings given to this film by the reviewers on this site and you'd think this movie ranked up there with Ben-Hur or Gone With The Wind. What's happened, of course, is that the home-town Provo crowd and their Utah co-religionists have packed the site with positive reviews. Page after page of raves for what is, in essence, a film with all the production values - as good as they are - of a made-for-TV movie. Especially egregious in the film was the absurd English accent attempted by actor Kirby Heybone - absolutely the worst foreign accent on film since that Scottish actor tried to pass as a Russian in 'Hunt for the Red October.' So, despite the seemingly objective, patriotic, mainstream message of this war movie, in reality director Ryan Little's film is more an unconscious homage to the work of Leni Riefenstahl than anything else. Dr. Goebbel's would not have approved of the message of this film, of course, but he would certainly have admired the technique.",4,13,25,7 May 2005
Vicky Cristina Barcelona," Inoffensive; Mildly Diverting
","A 73-year old director apparently encouraging upper middle class poseurs to 'seize the day' - a la Woody, perhaps? There are a couple of subdued chuckles to be had in this movie, but mostly it seems to be directed toward a special type of regretful woman approaching or just past menopause. There's not a sign of the sharp wit Woody was noted for; instead, it's just a rather bored sigh. This movie is about as inspiring as a New Yorker cartoon, and seemingly meant for the same audience: affluent, pretentious, unhappy.What was Woody trying to do in this film, make Scarlett Johansson seem dense and dull? That's unforgivable. All the actors were absolutely fine, especially Penelope Cruz, but the writing was just not there. I think this was an especially poor effort from the former maestro.",6,3,9,4 September 2008
Valkyrie," Only Average At Best
","The very high profile cast of this film notwithstanding, I'm afraid that 'Valkyrie' has all the gravitas of a made-for-TV movie. How some of the top names in British and continental cinema got roped into accepting parts in this film I will never understand - unless it was a matter of money, of course. Especially disappointing is the practically non-existent parts for actresses Carice van Houten and Halina Reijn. What a waste of two talented actresses. And as for the actor who played Hitler, all I can say is that after the phenomenal performance of Austrian Actor Bruno Ganz as Hitler in the film 'The Downfall' no other actor should ever be allowed to play the Fuhrer.The plot of the film certainly has some large holes in it, too. The very idea that German Army colonels were ordering around various German generals seems pretty far fetched.Finally, of course, there's Tom Cruise playing Colonel Stauffenberg. Cruise brings nothing special to the role. If the makers of this movie were at all serious in the subject matter they should have chosen a different actor to play the role. Cruise is just too lightweight to carry off such an important role.The highlights of the film were the tri-motor aircraft at the beginning, and the very good musical score played at the ending credits. Everything in between was neither here nor there.",5,24,56,25 December 2008
