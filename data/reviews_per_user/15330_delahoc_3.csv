Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The legend continues
","I was one of the few people I knew who was reading about the making of the original Star Wars months before it's release and looking forward to seeing it. The trilogy broke new ground in story-telling, special effects, and movie genres, and deserved all the recognition it got.Like everyone else, I anxiously awaited the release of more movies, and hearing of Episode 1, waited the eighteen months or so before it finally arrived in our cinemas then rushed out to see it. On one level I was not disappointed - new characters, new stories, filling in some holes, and great special effects. On another level I was a little let down - perhaps I was expecting too much, but the marketing, pre-release promotion and hoopla certainly encouraged me to.I'm very pleased with Anakin, and I am not looking forward to seeing him turn to the dark side. I like him now, and I don't want him spoiled - yet I know it must happen.I was disappointed with Obi-wan. While Ewan McGregor has made me believe that he will grow into the character as portrayed by Sir Alec Guiness, the character was still flat, and seemed to have little to do or say.Qui-Gon Jinn seemed to be developing nicely, and was killed far too early. It seemed to me that this was little more than plot mimicry - we killed Obi-Wan early in Star Wars and it worked, we need to do it again this time. He had scope, and Liam Neeson lent the stage a presence. Not a good idea. He will, no doubt, be resurrected in spirit form during the next movies (as was Obi-Wan), but that will be little consolation.Queen Amidala needs a little more work, and I look forward to seeing Natalie Portman develop her further. She's a great actress and was underutilised in this film. Perhaps when she and Anakin get it together the love story there will allow her to grow - and perhaps watching Anakin turn to the dark side will see her blossom.I take it we wont see Jar Jar Binks any more. My daughter likes him, and I thought he was okay, but he grated a little after a while.The script was trying to achieve too much, I thought. There were so many stories, sub-plots and twists that my daughters started to lose track of it all. Not a good sign. A little more pacing would have helped.Still, a brilliant addition to the legend, and a worthy start to the next trilogy. It can only get better from here.And George, if you need someone to direct the next one, my phone number is....",8,0,0,6 December 1999
LÃ©on: The Professional," A rich experience - at once delightful, sensual and disturbing.
","An unexpected delight when I first caught it. It has so many highlights - the sensitive, imaginative direction, three powerful and moving performances from it's main cast, and a story rich in character, emotion and twists.It took me a moment to get over Mathilda's immediate presence of mind when she returned home - an emotional control and quick thinking well beyond her years. But from then on it didn't look back.I'd seen 'Fifth Element' prior to this, and was blown away by the rich imagery, innovative storylines, and imaginative direction. I thought it a grossly underrated film. But here, Besson really shows his skill. I was hooked from start to finish.Jean Reno, is - as always - a commanding screen presence. His Leon is complex: at times bumbling, intelligent, naive and worldly, yet all the time played with such subtlety. He is so totally believable at all times. A sympathetic character despite his profession, we feel so totally for him that the final moments of the film are strong and lasting.Natalie Portman is a gem. What a find. A maturity of performance well beyond her years, able to evoke whatever emotion is required with conviction and utter believability. So totally sensual at such a young age, one can hardly imagine what we can look forward to in the years to come. This is a tour-de-force performance from a talented actress. I'll be watching out for her ...Gary Oldman once again delivers a stunning performance. No one goes mad like Gary Oldman. The insanity is hypnotic, and yet another faultless performance from this incredibly underrated and under-used actor. hen Jack Nicholson goes mad you can hear it clear across the country. When Gary Oldman goes mad it's a fire that burns from within and consumes you quietly and willingly.I wish there were more films like this.",10,0,1,5 September 1999
The Matrix," Whoa ... !
","These days, with all the loud, intense marketing that accompanies major movies, it's sometimes difficult to separate the film from the hype. 'The Matrix', however, is one film that is even bigger and better than the hype that tries to sell it.It's rare these days to find movies with no plot holes, no plot flaws. Even with the recent improvements in SFX and CGI, it's rare to find a movie where the effects just cannot be flawed (well, on freeze-frame I actually found a bungee cord that the wore-removal guys didn't do such a good job on).The Matrix not only lives up to it's promise, but far exceeds it. It redefines excitement.Hugo Weaving is a much under-utilised actor, one of Australia's best. It's good to see Australian actors like Russell Crow and Guy Pearce getting the attention and plaudits they deserve, but Hugo Weaving should be working more. Whilst he is superb here as the evil and emotionless villain, check out some of his previous Australian miniseries ('Dirtwater Dynasty' and 'Bodyline') to see him really shine.",10,0,0,12 November 2000
