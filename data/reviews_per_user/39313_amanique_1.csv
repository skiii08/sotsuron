The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Self-discovery therapy
","Directed by Stephen Chbosky, based on his own bestseller, 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' tells the story of a group of young 'Wallflowers' a term for people extremely introvert, shy, that avoids being part of or rather exclude themselves from most common social circles and therefore feel a hard time making friends. In this film ,in particular, the origin of these disorders is often of sexual nature, although this is not the central aspect of the story. In the same line of 'Dead Poets Society' (1989 ), this film reminds the adolescence and the unforgettable friends who pass through our lives and make us 'feel infinite.' Almost like Remy's cooks in 'Ratatouille' (2007 ), this film arouses feelings and memories that are not always present, but are deeply rooted in the depths of our souls. A love story, a story of fears and insecurities, but most of all a self-discovery therapy.",8,1,2,16 May 2016
