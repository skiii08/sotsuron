Ali," Will Smith is brilliant
","and while I walked away not knowing much more about Ali's inner thoughts, I was blown away by some of the performances.  Jon Voight, Will Smith, and Jamie Foxx simply became the characters they were portraying.  Academy Award nominations will come out of this flick.There were moments of Michael Mann's direction that were inspired, with many people talking and moving simultaneously; but he came up short when the movie was over.  As I walked back to my car, just felt an empty place in my heart for the soul of Ali.  What did he really think about boxing -- was it just a means to an end or was he 'called'?  What did he really think about being a family man.  The only hint was when he walked with Michael Michele.
I gave it a B- for direction, an A for acting.  Mr. Smith may never be better!",7,0,0,6 January 2002
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," The book came to life on the screen!
","Can't believe how much the experience of seeing the movie matched my expectations.  Columbus was so faithful to the book that we can now set aside that worry and look at the film.  His choices of actors for the movie were perfect; while never a Richard Harris fan, he IS Dumbledore.
Hope that the second movie lets Daniel Radcliffe spread his acting wings more.  Also, can someone tone down John Williams' music a bit?!",9,0,0,17 November 2001
