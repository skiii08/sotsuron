Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," ...but it set up the series! Doesn't it???
","Many like this movie.  But ask anyone who likes it, and they will be unable to find specifically what they liked about it.  The answer I have heard the most is 'It was just setting up the series'.  I disagree.  A movie should stand on its own.It made money (1 billion short of Titanic), but left little impression on the public.  Much of the merchandise was left behind at the store and Pizza Hut.The fans cared more about Star Wars than Geo Lucas did.  That may change for episode Deux.",Null,0,1,19 October 1999
