It," Lives up to the hype
","I was able to see this movie recently at a local theater and I must say, I was far from disappointed. From seeing the trailer, I was expecting another average remake but this is far from such. IT truly captures a good balance of fear, humor, and a major creep factor. From the beginning when Georgie is devoured near the sewers after being tempted into reaching his arm to Pennywise's terrifying teeth, all the way to the intense final battle to Pennywise's ultimate demise, I found myself laughing, jumping, shaking, and biting my fingernails all in the duration of the film. You certainly rarely feel the 2 hour 15 minute run time, except for a few times when I felt the movie was sort of dragging on, but even the slower scenes were an important part of character development. I found myself devoured with the amazing job of Pennywise. The clown truly was insanely creepy, parts where he nearly grabbed the children had me lurching forward in my seat, sweating with anticipation. There's not much bad one can say about this movie, even the immature jokes made me giggle like a small child. One really finds them self rooting for the kids and cheering them on as they fight Pennywise and their own inner demons and fears. Overall, this was a great movie and I found my money well spent. If you don't mind a few jump scares and a slight fear of walking near sewer grates for a while, this movie is well worth your time.",8,3,5,14 September 2017
