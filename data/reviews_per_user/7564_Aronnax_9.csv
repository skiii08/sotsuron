Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," peeyoosah!
","I have to agree with all the negative comments. What a huge disappointment. It felt like Lucas shot the very first draft of his script. Ewan, Liam and Samuel are GREAT actors, but they all stink in this. The editing stinks. The FX are very good, but never great. Sorry, but the pod race looks like a model pod hanging in front of blurry brown & tan CGI backgrounds, and the final battle never feels real: the sky is too blue, the grass is too green, and the bots are too clean. The film's biggest crime, though, is leaving Obi Wan on that spaceship with nothing to do, especially when you've got Ewan playing him. One big question: in the original 3 films, why didn't R2 know that Darth, aka Annakin, was his creator? Is it even hinted at? And why does the final saber fight take place in what looks like a huge death star? And is it true that an angry, disillusioned Jar Jar will turn to the dark side and call himself Boba Fett? That was a joke, not a spoiler.",3,0,1,25 June 2001
"I, Robot"," Logan's Run for the new millennium
","My 13 year old nephew loved this, but I can't believe this cheese ball film is generating any kind of serious discussion from anyone over the age of 13, let alone some of the decent reviews it's been getting.There's nothing worse than sci fi movies that make the future look cheesy. Blade Runner got it right, so did Proyas in The Crow and Dark City, but I, Fembot reminded me more of Arnold's Sixth Day or even the original Logan's Run. To make matters worse the CGI looked bad. Even the cars looked like cartoons, let alone the bad robots that never looked 3 dimensional. Did anyone have the feeling that we saw these Droid battles in Phantom Menace? And did anyone notice that Gangs of New York shot when the tough street kids were getting ready to fight the bots? And what was with Smith's hip hop gangsta strut? But my biggest question is, since when do PG-13 movies have full nudity? OK, so it was his butt, but that shower scene wasn't a quick two second shot. And why didn't he have a steamy shower door like the chick did later in the film? I got the feeling that he worked out like a maniac for Ali and he wants to preserve his big pecs and buns before the roids wear off. But come on, that scene was the definition of the word gratuitous and doesn't belong in a PG-13 family summer film.The trailer was cheesy and so's the movie.",3,1,2,17 July 2004
Dark City," ditto the kudos
","***SPOILER***A thought for those who didn't 'get' why this movie is so great: watch it again. I really liked it the first time I saw it, but LOVED it the second time. What a great, deep movie. Even Keifer's performance was much improved on second viewing. And I don't understand why people think the ending is a let down. Those final shots of him recapturing the love of his life have to be among the most romantic images ever put in a 'sci-fi' movie. He creates Shell Beach, brings light to the world, and meets the woman he fell in love with who now suffers from the amnesia that he suffered with at the beginning. She stood up for him while his memories were gone, now he'll do the same for her. This is what true love is all about, and we know they'll get together. Plus the movie has a great SCORE. I only wish I saw this in a theater.",9,0,2,3 November 2002
Pearl Harbor," what a load of crap!
","This confirms it. Hollywood is run by idiots. I can't believe they wasted so much money on such an awful story. Granted, this film did have it's emotional moments and I did get choked up a few times, but it was when the film focused on the real events and the real people caught up in it. It was never during the lame, blandly acted love triangle. Who approved this love triangle story? And three hours of it? Example & semi-SPOILER: the movie hit rock bottom right after the bombing, after we've witnessed an unbelievable - and true - horror story. Ben and Josh show up in the hospital - full of dying men - and Ben gets all cranky because his feelings were hurt. Are we really supposed to care about what happens to this flat love triangle after we've witnessed such real life carnage? And since everything is shot so picture perfect (aka antiseptic), these characters never become real. They look like models in a detergent commercial. Another low was the second half of the attack sequence, when the movie goes Star Wars and Ben and Josh become superhero flyboys ('Yee-haw! I got me one!') I won't even get into the shots that were ripped right out of Titanic. They even threw in the Queen Mary, and ruined the scene with some corn ball hijinx.  I could go on, but life is too short.",1,1,1,7 June 2001
The Dirty Dozen," cruel, overlong and overrated
","Warning: spoilers ahead. Despite great performances all around (save for Telly Savalas' giggling psycho), this is one overrated and overlong 'classic' action movie. I have a hard time when Hollywood tries to turn murderers and rapists -- all sentenced to death or life in prison -- into a bunch of lovable, misunderstood goofballs. I could buy it if one or two of them had been wrongfully accused, but eleven of them? Or rather six of them, since the other half of the 'dozen' aren't even developed into characters. I could also buy it if they redeem themselves or come to some personal revelation through their mission, but the finale of this film was so sadistic that it ruined everything that had been set up. Are we supposed to cheer when these so far unredeemed 'heroes' pour gasoline on a bunch of trapped Nazi officers' WIVES?? Why did the writers put women in this scene at all? Where's the redemption in psychos acting psychotic? This finale just puts them on the same level as the Nazis, but unfortunately this film isn't going for any kind of moral message. The screaming, trapped women getting doused in gasoline by a bunch of unredeemed murderers and rapists completely ruined what had been an OK action film.",4,21,43,20 May 2001
Mulholland Drive," Naomi Watts, Best Actress 2001
","What a great movie! How about Mulholland Drive and Memento for a double feature? Like Memento, this one really stayed with me. I wish Lynch would do a mainstream Hollywood horror movie, like a remake of the Exorcist. He would scare the living sh*t out of everybody!The acting is incredible! Who is Naomi Watts, and will she be nominated for Best Actress this year? She deserves to win. This is one of the most incredible performances I've seen in years.Thank you David for keeping film alive. ** SPOILERS **I'm surprised so many people don't 'get' this movie! I hate to give it away, but the happy go lucky Nancy Drew first half is a dream, and the scary, sad second half is the reality. It's the tell tale heart, as told from the POV of somebody who went to Hollywood all starry eyed, and wound up like so many others: used, crushed and spit out by the seedy, selfish nightmare that is LA.",9,1,1,17 October 2001
The Matrix Reloaded," bad bad bad
","Man, this movie STUNK! It's the worst big sequel since Star Trek V, or King Kong Lives. It's boring, the music is bad, the fx are cheesy, there's no story,  the characters never shut up, there's nothing LESS exciting than a slow motion action sequence... and it all goes on WAY TOO LONG! Every action scene seems twice as long as it should be. The CGI looked as phony as the new Star Wars movies, where you can actually see the stars' faces superimposed over digital bodies. Then when the folks of Zion started gyrating and humping to techno music while Neo and his babe made out, I had to laugh. It was right out of the 10 Commandments orgy sequence. All the Zion stuff looked like Star Trek meets Waterworld, and all the gratuitous action stuff looked like a Jerry Bruckheimer movie, like the Bad Boys II trailer we saw before the film even started. And the story? What story? That's what made the first Matrix stand out - Neo's journey from hacker to hero. Here it's all about how cool the phony CGI looks while the characters pose in sunglasses. What a complete mess. The fact that it was so boring adds insult to injury. I'll skip Revolutions and watch the original again.",3,0,0,27 May 2003
Mystic River," a low point for all involved
","Wow. I have to agree with the others here who commented about how overrated this film is. I'm a huge Clint fan, both as an actor and especially as a director. In his own way he's an American auteur. Unfortunately Mystic River is one of his weakest movies ever. **Spoilers**Not only is it painfully slow, but it's painfully cliched. Events are telegraphed miles in advance. Some of the dialogue is awful. Tim Robbins (the best thing in this movie) going on about 'I had to split my personality into somebody else so I could deal with the abuse' is a great example of bad dialogue. The wonderful Marcia Gay Harden plays her role like a bug-eyed looney from a 1930s Universal horror film. If the usually incredible Sean Penn cried one more time I would have puked. And this is one of those movies that so obviously sets up a killer that you know it can't be that character, and then in the last ten minutes the real killer is discovered. But I have one last complaint. Clint should stick to directing and give up composing. The music is treacle. The crescendo blast of music at the end when a gun is shot and the screen cuts to a bright sunny day was too much. He should stick with Lennie Niehaus.This is similar in many ways to Blood Work and True Crime, where some of the acting is way over the top cliched, and some of the plot twists come either too late or out of left field. Clint is a wonderful director, but like Woody Allen he's been in a slump lately. Let's hope they both recover soon.",Null,0,0,20 November 2003
Gladiator," remake of Fall of the Roman Empire
","What nobody's noticed is that this is basically a remake of the 60s epic 'Fall of the Roman Empire', with Alec Guiness, Sophia Loren, Christopher Plummer and Stephen Boyd. While 'Gladiator' has great acting and a surprisingly involving story, not to mention amazing action scenes, the older film beats it in one very important area: producer Samuel Bronston rebuilt the Roman Forum in Spain, so the sets are real. 'Gladiator' is all digital and looks it. There's probably not one bit of natural light in the entire film. That's too bad, because otherwise it's very entertaining. As for 'Fall of the Roman Empire', it's pretty dated, but it's also one of the most visually stunning films ever made and has a GREAT Dimitri Tiomkin score. Try to see it letterboxed if you can.",Null,0,0,7 May 2000
