The Expendables 2," Great to see they're still here!
","I saw The Expendables II this morning at a pr√© screening. What can I tell you about this movie. Firstly, it's really action packed. You're blasted off in the first few minutes leading up to the actual story. Obviously, this is not a film with a great script or impressive acting.However, the story works well for what it's supposed to do! It is greatly entertaining if you are looking for an action packed movie loaded with iconic action stars like Stallone,Willis and many more. The addition of Chuck Norris and van Damme to the cast worked out well. It's really good to see Chuck Norris in action again and he really pulls it off! I expect that the people who will like this movie most will be the fans of the old guard like Stallone, Schwwarzennegger and Norris and the other cast members. Someone I really liked was Liam Hemsworth who did a great job and stood his own between these action giants! Nan Yu as Maggie was also a good casting choice an did what she was supposed to do.Aside from the 'overdrive' action the film also had a lot of humor, which gave some counterweight to the action.I hope, but quite frankly expect this will do really well in cinema's globally. As a long time Sylvester Stallone fan I can only hope that he (and his family) will find the strenght to overcome the loss of his son.To the people who are going to see this extravanganza, I hope you'll enjoy it as much as I did!",9,192,302,12 August 2012
The Hunger Games," Incredibly shallow
","To start off I have to admit to not knowing the books and the characters in the story but this can often be a good thing. You come in without any expectations and hopefully be pleasantly surprised by the storyline, direction, acting, action and or something else.The only thing that surprised me here that I was planning to leave the viewing before the end. The chemistry between the actors was terrible. You could not connect to the characters because there was no real human element to connect to. If the book is really that appealing, then this has to be a huge disappointment. There have been references to Twilight because of the 'teen' appeal. And surely the twilight series could be a lot better than what we've seen. But at least there is a cast you can sort of connect to. Try and imagine that these young people are really fighting for their lives and check that with what you feel looking at this movie. What is a real shame is that something as bad as this is getting box office rewards and really enjoyable films (maybe not brilliant) are past by.If I had known what I was going to see I certainly would've stayed away. You will not be seeing me at the sequel!",2,15,19,10 April 2012
Thor: The Dark World," Great entertainment
","I saw The Dark World yesterday and was not disappointed. Not like Iron man, that I really liked only to see a really bad sequel and a not so good second sequel, this movie delivers all the way. A really good cast, a story fit for this movie, heaps of action, great special effects and balanced and effective humor made this a real fun experience. I will not give anything away but I do recommend you stay in your seat till the very end!! There is to much to write down here and you should see it for yourself but this is up there with the Avengers and Spiderman 1 and 2, it's just that good and that much fun. And let's be honest, who wan's to leave the cinema being sorry he went. This is not likely in this case!I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",9,6,13,2 November 2013
