Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," not a letdown
","I managed to get tickets for this movie on the opening weekend. Everyone who already saw it said 'It wasn't that good, it was a letdown, etc.' Well, I think that they were just afraid to be criticized for liking a grand-scale movie, because it was a good movie!  It wasn't quite on par with, say, The Empire Strikes Back, but it was definitely the best movie I've seen for a while.",9,0,0,22 May 1999
