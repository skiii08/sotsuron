Airlift," best movie ever everyone must watch
","this movie is a history,drama,thriller,etc.... must watch this movie ... The film captures the story of the Indians stuck in Kuwait during that time, through the eyes of Ranjit Katiyal and a few other characters. This is a story about how these Indians, with the help of Ranjit Katiyal, managed to survive the Iraqi invasion, andagainst all odds, move across Iraq into Jordan, from where they were brought home to India by the largest ever Airlift attempted in the history of the world. Arriving in Baghdad Katiyal discovers that the Indian Embassy is of no help. The consul explains that they cannot issue passports since many others – Pakistanis and Bangladeshis – use war as a convenient excuse to claim Indian nationality. Kuwaitis in Iraq have also fled. The only remaining option, Iraqi Foreign Minister Aziz is somewhat helpful. He is a friend of Katiyal and is sympathetic to the cause. He discloses that an Indian merchant ship is due to arrive in Iraq and he will tacitly permit the 500 Indians to leave on the ship. But as soon as the buses are loaded and ready to leave Katiyal receives the news that there is a UN embargo and ships are barred from entering or leaving Iraq. One of Katiyal's cantankerous employees rails against him. Amrita comes to his defense and after a loud argument everyone is resolutely supportive of Katiyal. Katiyal continues to keep in touch with the Indian Ministry officer Kohli but Kohli is somewhat of a sluggard. But when his own father recounts their tale of woe during the partition of India, Kohli awakens and begins to actively petition the Minister. The Minister, half in frustration and half in agreement, asks Kohli to handle it. Kohli approaches Air India (then national airline) and orchestrates an evacuation of the 170,000 Indians in Kuwait. Katiyal bluffs and threatens the Major to get him to let them leave. Kohli pleads and wrangles the Indian establishment to get the Amman Embassy to issue permits. When Katiyal finally loads up the Indians and leaves he encounters hostile Iraqi soldiers who stop him at a border checkpoint and threaten to rape Amrita. Katiyal fights them off when he finds the Indian contingent right behind him. The Iraqi soldier drops his weapons and lets them pass. They all arrive in Jordan and the Amman Embassy receives word in the nick of time to let them leave for India. Kohli has successfully negotiated safe passage of all the Indians. Air India supplies the planes and the pilots, previously unwilling to fly over war zones, have had a change of heart towards their brethren. The Indian tricolor is hoisted over the Jordan airport and the film ends as the Indians salute Katiyal as they board the planes that will take them home.even though the link would help many of you to watch this moviehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD3xnsZ4tYs",10,0,1,12 February 2016
