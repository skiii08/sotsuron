Lucky Number Slevin," Good one
","This was a good movie. It reminded me a lot of Pulp Fiction although all subplots were more convergent in this one.Good performances from everyone involved, especially Bruce Willis and Ben Kingsley.The twist in the end (i.e. the explanation to all question marks) is a little bit predictable but overall this movie has a feeling of mystery in it.The scenery and the dialog were also top notch.Lucy L --> beautiful as always! :) I give it 8/10 Molotov cocktails!",8,0,2,27 August 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," Impressive
","OK, this one has over 1000 reviews so far so I'm not going to write a complete review. Instead let me highlight one positive and one negative aspect of this movie.The good: The special effects in this movie are honestly the most impressing thing I've ever seen. The movie is worth seeing just alone for this reason.The way they present the ghost pirates, the huge octopus and the impressive surroundings is breathtaking. This is a heroic effort! The bad: This movie suffers from the 'this is second part but we already know that we will do another one'-syndrome. The first Pirates movie felt a lot more fulfilled with no annoying 'see you later' ending. The last 30 minutes in this one, are basically a setup for the third movie.If you're not sure what I mean, compare this with the Matrix trilogy. The same thing happened in Reloaded.Overall, this is great movie that is a worthy follow-up to the original Pirates of Carribbean. I'll give it 8 out of 10 Molotov cocktails.",8,3,6,10 August 2006
We Were Soldiers," What the hell were they thinking?
","Actually, I don't even know where to start This is without any doubts one of the most disappointing movies I've ever seen.. I had great expectations, I was looking forward to see this movie, damn' I even checked the IMDB ratingThe movie starts with the ordinary `We are proud American soldiers ready to die for our country' crap. Every soldier is a hero, a perfect husband and a loving father with a great family living in a nice house. The first 45 minutes are a serious version of The Truman Show. And yes you'll see crying children asking daddie `What is war?'.. and yes you'll see the badass old veteran being harsh against the young soldiers.. and yes surprisingly you'll also see a young soldier that is deeply in love with his wife and wonders if 'the war is right or not'..Unfortunately the first 45 minutes are the best part of the movie. It seems that after the soldiers arrive in Vietnam, the director stopped using the manuscript and started to improvise the whole movie. The rest of the movie is a huge and brutal orgy in the exchange of fire between Americans and Vietcong. The problem is that the war part of the movie is so crappy made that sometimes I couldn't believe my eyes that none of the people involved in the movie, said `Guys, this is bad!'.The most annoying thing is probably how unrealistic the fire fights actually are. Most of the Vietcong soldiers have one mission  to run towards the Americans and start shooting only within 10 meter range. It's like playing a badly programmed computer game with non-existent enemy AI. Another annoying thing is that classical `Rambo-syndrome'. The `less important' American soldiers are dying all over the place. The bullets are hitting the ground just a few inches from the main characters but are they hiding and taking cover? Of course not They standing in the middle of the action and kill every bad guy they spot..Don't expect the unexpected in this film. Every time a soldier tries to go back and pick up a wounded team mate, he will die. Every time someone dies, he will always have enough time to say `Tell my wife I love her' before he closes his eyes. The list of complains could go on foreverAnd I probably shouldn't even mention the incident with the photographer's camera which first is shot out of his hands and later magically picked up hanging on a tree. OMG what were they thinking",1,9,20,8 August 2002
The Devil Wears Prada," Could it be any more predictable??
","I saw this movie together with a friend of mine and basically decided to be polite, shut up and remain seated (my friend was for some reason under the assumption that this movie was good).I didn't like it at all.My biggest problem with this fluffy thing is that the movie is so brutally predictable. A severely mentally retarded squirrel would be able to give away the ending after 20-30 minutes into the movie.There are really NO surprises here at all. The main character girl realizes that her ideals were correct from the start and leaves the superficial job and goes back to her boyfriend. This is the plot twist in this one :).",3,2,3,23 December 2006
The Machinist," A great movie!
","Christian Bale is one of the best actors. It surprises me how underrated he was until this year considering his performance in a numerous number of terrific flicks (Amer. Psycho, Equilibrium etc). This year, due to both Machinist and the new Batman movie, things are at last looking better! This movie is not an easy one. It is disturbing and confusing many times but follows a logical and unexpected plot. It basically tells a story of how bad conscience and loneliness may affect a human mind. A psychological thriller at its best! The performance of Mr Bale is top-notch as always.Score: 9 of 10.",9,1,1,14 August 2005
The Incredibles," Technically beautiful
","Wow.. This movie is technically breathtaking. The character animations, the scenery and the voices (Samuel Jackson is perfect in his role) are top notch. One can only imagine the thousands of hours that were necessary to create this technical masterpiece. This is another impressing performance from Pixar.The plot of the movie is also both original and entertaining. It manages to be enjoyable for both kids and adults.The pure humor part may not be as strong and consistent as in Finding Nemo but nevertheless Incredibles succeeds in making you smile on several occasions.7/10",7,2,4,15 January 2005
Garden State," Beautiful
","This movie is so beautiful and it works on so many levels.This is a feel-good movie that will without any doubt, leave most of the audience feeling just that at the closing credits.What impresses me the most is the fact that the movie itself does not contain any brilliant or particularly interesting plot, but instead lives solely on the performance of the cast and the way it was directed. Garden State is a travel in small, small things that linked together bring the movie's characters closer and closer to happiness.Natalie Portman is absolutely amazing in this movie. Her character steals most of the scenes and I am astonished how well this girl can act (seeing her previously in Star Wars with George Lucas wooden 'Anakin, let go of me' dialog).Score: 10 of 10",10,0,1,14 August 2005
From Dusk Till Dawn," Classic!
","This is a classic movie from Rodriguez/Tarrantino containing an impressing set of actors (Clooney, Keitel, Lewis, Hayek etc).The movie is split in two distinct parts. The first one follows a standard Tarrantino formula with absolutely terrific dialog and cool scenery. The second part of the movie is more action-oriented although still filmed with a lot of style (reminds me of Desperado).Favorite line: Seth: If you try to run, I've got six little friends and they can all run faster than you can. Score: 9 of 10.",9,0,1,14 August 2005
National Treasure," Disney version of Da Vinci Code
",I must say that I'm quite surprised by the high rating of National Treasure here on IMDb. This movie does not deserve it.I went to see this movie with an expectation of a mix of Indiana Jones and Da Vinci Code. What I've got was a Disney-kid-version of Dan Brown's book.The movie was ruined for me after appr 5 or 6 minutes when the main character (played by Nicholas Cage) and his friends discover a ship wreck beneath the ice with help of a metal detector. Somehow the first part of the ship that they manage to dig up is the metal plate that shows the name of vessel. Easy for the younger kids to follow the plot? Yes. Realistic for the audience over 15 years? No.Additionally Nicholas Cage does a terrible performance and acts totally uninspired in this movie. Another irritating thing is the character of Justin Bartha delivering tiresome one-liners throughout the whole goddamn movie.This might be an OK family movie especially since parts of it are a basic lesson in the American history.I find it however difficult to recommend National Treasure to anyone older than 15.4/10,4,0,2,15 January 2005
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Cheap humor that works
","I am a big fan of Will Ferrell who in my opinion was one of the most entertaining members of the Saturday Night Live show. Unfortunately the recent movies starring Ferrell as the leading actor have been quite disappointing (Elf and Old School).This is however a very funny movie, especially considering that most jokes are quite cheap (no sophisticated humor here).The funniest character in the movie is however not Ron Burgundy (played by Ferrell). Instead the role of slightly retarded Brick Tamland is brilliantly performed by the always entertaining Steve Carrell (Late Show with Jon Stewart and Bruce Almighty). He delivers a bunch of one-liners that are tremendous fun.Another thumbs-up goes to the short Ben Stiller appearance as the Spanish anchorman! Highly recommended if you're after some cheap laughs.7/10",7,0,1,15 January 2005
Fantastic Four," Nice
","I agree with most of the negative reviews here. This movie was no brain teaser in any way and yes Jessica Alba is not a good actress... but even though I must still confess that I really like this flick. I don't know if it was its simplicity, one-liners, comic book hero theme etc, but I really enjoyed it!I think FF is a terrific adaptation of the comic book world with difficult special effects done in a satisfying way! I particularly impressed how they recreated The Thing without the character being ridiculous.A lot better than the stinky Spiderman2 anyway :).Score: 7 of 10",7,2,5,14 August 2005
