","Alllrrrighty then, oh sorry, wrong guy....  So the year is still young, but this movie really made me laugh.  It's been a long time since a slapstick movie like this has really worked.  Adam Sandler and the adorable Drew Barrymore were a perfect match.  It is obvious in this role that Sandler has matured as an actor.  I wouldn't be surprised if he starts to look for more dramatically challenging roles.  I liked the story line, for a comedy it actually had one, which was surprising in and of itself.  I would have cut out some of the walrus scenes.  Seen one walrus seen 'em all I guess.  It is also fun to try and spot some of the characters and situations that Sandler has worked with in the past.  I'm really baffled how the critics panned this movie?  I guess they aren't paid to have a sense of humor.",10,0,0,25 February 2004
