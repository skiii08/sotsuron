The Blair Witch Project," Blair Witch Farce
","I'm sorry, but I have to say that this was one of the worst movies that I have ever seen.  I will say that I may have been biased by the hype, but this movie was not scary at all.  I was expecting to see a movie that actually made me jump or get worked up.  There was only one time that this movie could have made me jump, when they were in the tent and the sides were being pounded on, but by then I was just so annoyed by the annoying personalities, I just wanted the movie to end.  I will say that I am sorry that I feel this way, I really wanted to like and be scared by this movie, but it just wasn't the case.  I could see that the three students were scared, at least by their level of swearing, they seemed to be, but their fright was not properly passed on to me.  What would I have done different? First off, make some of the shots a little clearer, when Heather was opening the stick packet and found the bloody mess, I couldn't make out what it was. I understand that it was part of Josh, but WHAT WAS IT?  It just added to my annoyance.  Add the outside perspective, not just one of the characters shooting.  After the 2nd or 3rd night of horror, they could have realistically set up a camera to record the campsite so we could see something happening.Like I said, I've been waiting for a movie to really scare the s**t out of me and hoped this would do it, but I was severely disappointed.  Maybe the next one to come along will.
