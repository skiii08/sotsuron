The Avengers," A very good (and Funny) Comic book WIN!
","This movies gets a 10 out of 10 in my book. Its Funny, Witty, and even at times... a little sad. However the movie ends beautifully. Make sure, if you go to see it, you watch the ENTIRE movie. There are 2 (not one, but 2) extra scenes at the end. the second you don't see until after the credits roll. The best part of the movie, In my opinion, is the part where all of the avengers, and his brother, stare down the tip of Hawkeye's arrow at Loki. These people definitely know what there doing. Hats off to joss Whedon for pulling of the movie of the year.... no. The movie of the century. Thats right folks, You heard it here first. this is the movie of the century. Now each of the Marvel movies leading up to this, 'Thor' , 'Captian America' , 'Iron Man' Etc, All deserve their respect, but this movie brings them all together to a fine point and tops them all. it may look like a match-up of Marvel VS. Halo, but it is definitely in a league of its own.",10,2,6,5 May 2012
