The Benchwarmers," Benchwarmers Causes Self Induced Coma
","This is hands down, one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Any adult or child with half a brain, will notice how stupid every joke is. Was this script written for a school play or something? It lacked real humor and originality. I was ashamed of the stars agreed to be in such a poor movie.I expected a lot more from the stars in this film. I cannot believe, they agreed to participate in such garbage comedy. I wouldn't even shame myself with a million dollar pay off to be in this film. Bottom line - Waste of money, waste of time. I should jump in front of a train, for even finishing watching it.",1,6,11,19 August 2006
