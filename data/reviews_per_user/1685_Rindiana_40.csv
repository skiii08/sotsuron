Angels & Demons," Thank Heaven for Symbologists!
","If you thought 'The Da Vinci Code' was stupid, have a look at this unspeakably ludicrous sequel.Howard & Co. surely were (made) aware of what a huge bore their first Dan Brown adaptation had been, so they switched to full throttle mode for this follow-up. But ironically, that didn't change a bit. All the hectic bustling around doesn't generate a shred of suspense, since the basic premise is so stupid one doesn't even attempt getting attached to the storyline. So you just stare at the screen in disbelief at how much time and money went into filming this piece of dreck. It's just one irrelevant episodic incident after another until a big disaster finale and a predictable twist finish the pic off for good, thank God! Hanks looks quite worn out the whole movie through... and deservedly so.2 out of 10 antimatter(!) bombs",2,3,9,8 September 2009
The Incredible Hulk," Big, Green and Mean
","One of those impersonal by-the-numbers comic adaptations with no real heart and soul, but lots of noisy mayhem and superficiality.Edward Norton should've known better, Roth and Hurt chew the scenery, and Liv is her usual doll-like self.The CGI work is rather bland, but the movie's energetic direction and some nice location work serve the entertainment factor. It could've been worse, it could've been better.Ange Lee's Hulk movie at least tried to inject a personal point of view to the tired franchise, this one's just big mainstream stuff. In the end, both movies get the same rating. Life's unfair.5 out of 10 bad Hulks",5,1,1,2 February 2011
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Ink and Paint Turned into Flesh and Blood
","This one's outstanding!!! The sheer wealth of artistic and technical on- and off-screen talents involved in all, I mean ALL production departments is awe-inspiring. But what's truly astonishing is the love and care that went into filming this. A Big Studio(s) entertainment movie with a heart! It's as if all those cynical producers, screenplay supervisors etc. were enchanted by the whole charming enterprise themselves.Seldom has a fantasy world been created more vividly. And the nostalgic impact seeing all your beloved old cartoon characters (and some amiable new ones) naturally interacting with each other and their human neighbours is simply mesmerizing. Watch the pic a second time to get all the funny one-liners and sight gags... and an umpteenth time for sheer pleasure.Every movie-loving person will be hooked immediately, but cartoon buffs and film noir freaks should keep tranquilizers ready.Were it not for the interminable and mildly dull showdown, which is a misstep, this would be a perfect masterpiece of light entertainment. But an imperfect masterpiece is more than enough.9 out of 10 cigar-chomping Baby Hermans",9,1,1,30 June 2009
Star Trek," Two Spocks for the Price of One
","A welcome energy boost to the zonked out 'Star Trek' franchise, this entertaining space adventure proves a much better prequel than what George Lucas did to his 'Star Wars' legacy.The literally rejuvenated Enterprise crew members - well cast with relatively unknown actors - are fleshed out just enough not to stoop to cheesiness, though the countless character expositions are way too much. But the emotional aspects work beautifully, while the revenge plot and the action scenes could have been more innovative. Anyway, the whole scenario - including the good special effects - is surprisingly believable and the screenplay finds the right balance between fun and earnestness, between homage and autonomy.Some more narrative surprises next time and we're in for a really good sci-fi movie series.6 out of 10 red matter attacks",6,1,3,29 September 2009
Inglourious Basterds," QT's Dirtey Douzen
","After the amiably simple pleasures of seeing some hot chicks kickin' the crap out of Kurt Russell, our favourite pulpinator QT is back in his self-glorifying Kill Bill mode, which means countless more or less dubious movie references, in-your-face violence and (oh-so-)clever verbal exchanges.To be frank, Tarantino's dialogue is partly first-class, with the opening chapter being particularly effective. And his ability to create tension and make the Nazi terror palpable should be stated to all those grumpy critics and humourless spokespersons of political correctness who don't get the gist of this huge Jewish revenge fake history joke.But all in all, the pic's just above average: some scenes go on for too long, some jokes fall flat, most characters remain opaque and while the cinema showdown features some nice gags, the last scene (concerning Hans Landa's fate, who's, by the way, brilliantly portrayed by Christoph Waltz) isn't half as clever as it should be.6 out of 10 marked Krauts",6,3,8,6 September 2009
Coraline," Alice Darkly Twisted
","Stop-motion animation is such a laborious task, particularly when presented in feature-length, that those few examples that are finally distributed are almost exclusively works of high quality both in form and content.That's especially true for Henry Selick's meticulously crafted Gothic tales with their wicked sense of humour and their intuition for the magic of the bizarre. His latest work - a clever twist on 'Alice in Wonderland' with subliminally menacing picture-perfect happiness replacing Carroll's liberating nonsense - succeeds in all the right departments, from the gorgeous vistas, the haunting score, the great character design and voice-work, the countless sight-gags, the well-paced narrative up to the balanced mixture of heart and brains.The story is a tad too episodic and the showdown slightly disappoints, though. But it's a wonderful pic, anyway.8 out of 10 button eyes",8,0,2,22 June 2009
Pirate Radio," The Boat That Sank
","For a movie about rock'n'roll this one's a much too sappy affair. But no need to be surprised since writer-director Richard Curtis' previous effort was the even sappier 'Love Actually'.And the weak spots are more or less the same: an overlong, sketchy and paper-thin narrative with lots of fake uplift and superficial emotions, cardboard characters and little sense of plot development, up to a terribly overblown finale.That's a shame because the premise is solid, the wonderful actors enliven their likable parts, the sixties flavour is intact and the tunes are great.But the pic's silliness and predictability are serious drawbacks, despite some laughs here and there.5 out of 10 pirate radios",5,4,8,15 November 2009
Juno," Knocked Up
","Like all crowd-pleasers rather too soft in the end and a tad too witty and quirky to be thoroughly believable, but still miles ahead of all those abominably crass and vulgar teenage comedies Apatow style that are constantly fabricated by the Hollywood machinery.The main assets are the well-paced screenplay, that finds a nice balance between laughter and more serious moments, and a wonderful ensemble cast led by charming Page.There's real emotional resonance in between all the cleverly staged comedy situations.7 out of 10 mailboxes filled with Tic Tacs",7,0,4,30 September 2010
The Terminator," 'I'll Be Back.' And He Was Right!
","Surprisingly well-made and memorable sci-fi action pic, helped immensely by the effective clean-cut storyline, Cameron's muscular direction, a haunting atmosphere and well-staged scenes of violence and destruction.And the role of a tight-lipped killer cyborg from the future suits Arnold's acting abilities to a T.Definitely superior to the much higher budgeted overblown sequel.A minor genre classic... and one of the very few really good Arnie vehicles.8 out of 10 belly-bursting fist moves",8,1,2,18 November 2009
Alien," The Talented Mr. Ridley
","There were times when Ridley Scott made first-class genre pics, well, eh, two pics to be concise: 'Blade Runner' and this spine-chilling space horror movie, which is still his best effort.It's basically an old-fashioned monster movie, complete with cats hiding in the dark and false attacks, but the accoutrements are ingenious: the Alien's design, right down to its parasitic ways of spawning and breeding, is - one might say - lovingly detailed; the expressionistic set-pieces feel just right; Weaver's heroine lends a touch of intelligence and vulnerability to the proceedings that avoids the usual genre movie machismo; the low-key characterizations of the crew members don't resort to clich√©s; and some nerve-wrecking shock and suspense scenes, interrupting an otherwise effectively unharried story-line, are masterly handled by Scott and his expert team.9 out of 10 gut-bursting baby Aliens",9,2,4,17 June 2009
Shutter Island," To the Lighthouse
","Flamboyantly silly and long-winded psychothriller/psychodrama that tries hard to say relevant things about mental conditions, memory and trauma, but in fact is nothing more than pulp without the necessary entertainment factor.Scorsese's lamentable attempt to inject his (admittedly gorgeous) visuals with an unnerving quality falls flat, while DiCaprio has always been the least successful in striking puzzled and worried poses.In the end, all the narrative twists and impressive set-pieces prove to be ineffective due to the lack of sympathy towards the wooden characters.And about that ambiguous story-line: It doesn't matter which version is true, both are ridiculous.4 out of 10 mental breakdowns",4,10,18,1 May 2010
The White Ribbon," Who's the Culprit, Who's the Victim?
","Another winner from proficient writer-director Haneke.While the linking of parental oppression and abuse with national (in this case German) characteristics, that seemingly led to the horrors of WWI and later to Nazism, seems a trifle too easy a solution, this otherwise superb study of human cruelty comes up trumps.No other contemporary director is able to create such a compelling atmosphere of subtle discomfort and hidden menace while imbuing every scene with a sense of dread and foreboding. The black-and-white photography is just as marvellous as the impeccable cast (with some of the children particularly outstanding.) And the story-line is perfectly balanced, with Haneke's familiar refusal for clear explanations fully intact.Those who call Haneke's work emptily nihilistic should take a look at the world around them: It's much worse. And through the pair of young lovers and a bird-loving boy he shows us what's also possible: kindness and sympathy, features most of this pic's characters surely cannot cope with.9 out of 10 white ribbons",9,5,15,10 April 2010
Shrek Forever After," Shrek the Last?
","The first two Shrek movies were not as brilliant as most critics said and this fourth installment (after the weak third part) is not quite as bad as they say.Yes, there's a certain slackness to all the calculated proceedings, but the basic premise is quite intriguing, though hardly original. At least, the pic moves reasonably well, some jokes are great and despite a rather lame showdown, which is a weakness of all the Shrek movies, the story (with its dark undercurrents of existential crises) is told effectively, with Rumpelstiltskin being a first-class villain.The many, many pop songs on the soundtrack grow tiresome after a short while.6 out of 10 hissing geese",6,1,2,30 November 2010
District 9," Respect Thy Prawny Neighbour
","Now that Peter Jackson has fallen into the Hollywood trap directing overlong excessive spectacles, at least he supports fresh talents who make highly original modestly budgeted genre pics with hearts and brains... just like he once did.Neill Blomkamp's the name of one of these prot√©g√©s and his first feature-length pic marks an electrifying starting point. This highly entertaining sci-fi action movie creates a tense and unusually credible setting with both tragic and satirical leanings and a seamless blending of doc-style versus clear-cut storytelling and top-notch CGI effects. The talented cast of unknown performers is another plus.Unfortunately, the pic's intensity declines slightly in the second half while the action elements take over. And the rushed ending is not completely satisfactory. (The allusions to apartheid, on the other hand, may be fairly obvious, but they're still effective.)7 out of 10 tasty cans of cat food",7,2,4,11 September 2009
Gran Torino," Make My Day! It Could Be My Last...
","Don't get me wrong! I like Eastwood, I really do. He's a fine if limited actor and he's a solid handyman director whose movies often touch on interesting topics. There's just one teenie-weenie problem: many of his movies, both as actor and director, simply aren't very good. I think there's one main reason for his directorial failures: Most issues Eastwood chooses to build his films around need a director with a more intellectual, a more imaginative approach than he is able to achieve. He's a mainstream-thinker trying to do art-house cinema. Sometimes, he gets away with it through pure craftsmanship. But not in this instance.This basically old-hat plot of the old curmudgeon mellowed by his adolescent Hmong neighbours into grandfatherly feelings and, of course(!), revenge and vigilantism is stock-full of amateurish acting, hoary plot machinations, lame culture-clash jokes and cardboard characters. Not to mention that solemn showdown.Technically, the pic's well accomplished, but who cares after two long hours.3 out of 10 geriatric action moves",3,9,19,19 June 2009
The Hurt Locker," Blown Away
","Unfortunately, this partially gripping pic isn't quite the sum of its parts. While individual scenes are well-crafted and the difficult situation that American G.I.'s are confronted with in Iraq is made perceptible, the attempts at character drama are rather irresolute, despite Renner's strong performance.The omittance of stereotypical narrative tropes and cheap combat splatter sequences is to be applauded as well as the expert direction. But something's missing while one effective set-piece after another is served up on a bloody plate. Maybe a political/social contextualization or a deeper look at the Iraqi people.What we're left with is a well-made war-actioner with half-realized efforts towards more serious issues.6 out of 10 human bombs",6,1,4,25 November 2010
Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs," Pie from the Sky
","Positively hyperactive disaster movie parody with an unusually creepy underside to it. The gags and puns fly by faster than one can say 'giant banana' and the excellent voice work is the icing on the cake.Unlike the best animated movies, the pic lacks a certain transcending magical quality - despite a few well-made tranquil moments, but the pace never flags and the predictably formulaic storyline is enhanced by the sheer exuberance of the whole likable enterprise that offers some wonderfully inventive moments.An immensely entertaining if not too memorable culinary roller-coaster ride.7 out of 10 spray-on shoes",7,1,5,24 January 2010
Pi," Spiralling Insanity
","Most pupils were driven mad by maths some way or the other, but the extremes this pic's mathematician hero is made to endure are literally disturbing.The director's gripping handling of the hallucinatory Kafkaesque scenery is so adept that one tends to forgive the movie's weaknesses of plotting. While a brilliant master of enigmatic cinema like David Lynch wisely opts for a blank-filled narrative , Aronofsky's screenplay throws some obvious parables and rather silly conspiracy theories into the mix, which disrupts the pic's otherwise effectively nightmarish qualities.Captivating from start to finish, but not nearly as intellectually stimulating as it ought to be.6 out of 10 drilled heads",6,0,1,12 January 2010
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," Men Who Hate Bad Thrillers
","Okay, okay, not that bad, just moderately entertaining without being particularly memorable or gripping.This condensed adaptation of a much-hyped Swedish page-turner starts promisingly and features an intensely portrayed female character - not to mention a strong subplot about her taking revenge on one of those titular misogynists -, but the basic mystery plot has nothing to offer you haven't seen before in dozens of other thrillers and whodunits: red herrings, mysterious assassinations, dark attics and even darker cellars, blurry photographs and false identities, archive and (we live in modern times) internet research and encoded messages, and, of courses, lots of hidden secrets and several (not too surprising) denouements.You feel like watching a compendium of narrative genre clich√©s told in a pedestrian fashion, but, at least, it's done without the shrill idiocy of most Hollywood thrillers.5 out of 10 forced tattoos",5,10,20,21 March 2010
Paranormal Activity," Blair Witch in Suburbia
","Just as it was the case with 'The Blair Witch Project' a decade ago this horror mockumentary is clearly a matter of love-it-or-hate-it. I actually liked the earlier pic despite its flaws and I've got the same opinion about this scary little shocker. (Yes, it IS scary! Don't listen to all those desensitized film geeks who get their kicks from chainsaw massacres and the likes.) I agree, the character actions are entirely too dependent on the visual and local limitations and thus seem partly forced and loose, and basically the script's just playing with old-hat spooky house clich√©s.But the narrative arc is quite effective, the central issue is treated with a certain inner logic, the performances are natural and the sparse use of special effects and gore is welcome in times of mindless slasher trash.7 out of 10 footsteps in the dark",7,2,3,10 January 2010
Toy Story," What Makes a Toy a Toy?
","Marvellously inventive, brilliantly rendered, perfectly paced, adorably characterized CGI gem with a sinister edge to its witty and intelligent storyline.The voice cast is a pleasure to behold and the toy figures are instantly likable.The alternation between action-packed moments, laugh-out-loud gags and scenes of emotional, downright existential crises offers a deeper viewing experience anyone could've hoped for.Despite two well-made sequels, this one's still the best installment of the much-loved franchise.8 out of 10 freak toys",8,0,0,24 October 2010
Toy Story 2," Collector's Item
","Hugely entertaining sequel, that lacks its predecessors compact and harmonious storyline as well as its dark subtext. Instead, we've got our toy friends on an epic rescue mission through town, along with some all too obvious pop culture references - another Star Wars parody, please?! - and sightly forced action moments.But it's still a good movie, full of funny one-liners and meticulous care for detail. The characters - old and new - are as amiable as ever, and here and there Pixar is still able to achieve moments of great beauty and wit.7 out of 10 double Buzzes",7,3,4,24 October 2010
Drag Me to Hell," This Pic Doesn't Drag, Save to Hell
","The long standing genre clich√© of the old gypsy hag's curse is driven to new extremes in this enjoyable darkly humorous horror romp.After his successful mainstream venture on the Spiderman franchise, Sam Raimi's return to his gory roots offers a lightweight variant to the Evil Dead trilogy. The dialogue is banal as usual, some CGI effects are overused and the plot points are basically predictable - the final scene is effective, though -, but Raimi sure knows how to make one jump in his seat and the pace never flags.And in times of primitive torture porn this... shall I call it... innocent piece of good ol' horror storytelling is surely welcome.6 out of 10 obsessed billy goats",6,1,4,16 September 2009
Up," Up, Up and Away
","After last year's slightly disappointing trip to outer space, this heartwarming modern fairy tale shows the PIXAR team back in top form.The visuals are as gorgeous and scrupulously detailed as ever, but the real winner is the clever, funny, bittersweet and highly entertaining screenplay which is both action-packed and touching without resorting to the preachy tone so often found in animated movies nowadays.Yes, the story loses some momentum in the middle section, but otherwise the balance between colorful kiddie adventure and a more mature personal drama of lost and readjusted aims in life is brilliantly realized.8 out of 10 talking dogs",8,0,0,20 September 2009
How to Train Your Dragon," Pet Dragon
","Despite the rather predictable boy-and-his-pet story one of the better computer-animated Dreamworks vehicles.The character work is excellent and the pic's refusal to go for cheap laughs and pop-culture references in favour of a more thorough storyline is welcome. Still, there's a certain (logical and emotional) discrepancy between the cartoonish dragon-fights and the more somber moments.Technically, the vistas are simply dazzling and the 3D effects are imaginatively used, but the extra oomph is missing.6 out of 10 lost legs",6,1,8,18 December 2010
The Da Vinci Code," Bad Hair Day
","It's difficult to decide what's more ridiculous: Tom Hanks' hairdo or the idiotic story of this torturously interminable, though admittedly stylishly produced scavenger hunt. But were it only for the jaw-droppingly inane conspiracy theories and plot contrivances on display here, one might still get some fun out of the sheer campiness of this big-budget small-brain bubble.But it's even worse: Ron Howard seems to have directed the whole pic in a state of stupor. Scenes drag on eternally, with lots of unintelligible things said by lots of uninteresting people.If you still care about the outcome of this huge scam of a movie after almost three hours, you're a much more tolerating person than I am.3 out of 10 psychopathic albino monks",3,9,16,8 September 2009
Zombieland," Beware of Zombie Clowns
","As far as Zombedies go, this is better than most... which aren't that many, anyway.After a wickedly funny and even somewhat frightening first half - with our nerdish hero's first zombie encounter being the hilarious highlight - the whole scenario grows rather stale and repetitive, despite some throwaway bits here and there. The overlong theme park showdown is no help either.On the other hand, the pic's freewheelin' approach is likable and B.M.'s cameo is nice, as forced as it may feel.5 out of 10 rare Twinkies",5,0,0,4 March 2010
Die Hard," Phallocentric Action Mayhem
","Whoever thought of a skyscraper as a perfect location for a modern-day one-man-army action-flick, seemingly stripped off of the nauseating excesses of Stallone/Schwarzenegger comic machismo, was damn right! Let's kill those lousy German high-tech terrorists like a real man inside a huge phallic glass-tower! Make my day, Hans! Okay, okay, most of the supporting characters are still annoying after all these years and some lines and situations are laughable, but McTiernan handles the claustrophobic setting surprisingly well and Willis's down-to-earth approach to heroism was refreshing. (Nowadays, he's certainly not a refreshing sight anymore.) And remember: 'He's in the elevator schacht.' 7 out of 10 blood-soaked shirts",7,0,3,12 June 2009
Psycho," Norman Birds
","Anyone ever notice Perkins' bird-like performance? Look at the stuffed birds in the motel room. And the way he's eating like a nervous sparrow. In a movie (and a directorial career) full of impish inside jokes, Hitch turns Norman Bates into a frightened fledgling unable to escape momma's nest.All in all, a gigantic and immensely well-made trick on the audience's expectations and the '√ºber'-mother of all the inferior slasher flicks that followed.(Were it not for the silly final speech to explain Norman's behaviour away with psychological mumbo-jumbo, this would be a minor classic.) 8 out of 10 healthy showers",8,0,0,11 June 2009
Jaws," Feeding Frenzy
","This big white shark not only killed his hapless on-screen victims, but - more disastrously - an era of intelligent and thought-provoking American cinema called New Hollywood. Spielberg introduced a new dimension of immensely successful pulp storytelling. No place for adult themes and honest emotions any more... at least in box-office terms.But fortunately, 'Jaws' is pre-bumptious Spielberg, when he still worked as an effective craftsman, not a self-important mainstream 'artist'.So the movie's thankfully devoid of the cuties and cheap symbolism and bathos, that would soon ruin most of Spielberg's work. Instead, what we get are solid thrills, a splendidly cast trio of shark-hunters, some funny lines and quite a shoddy-looking man-eating shark named Bruce.7 out of 10 crushed plastic cups",7,1,2,13 June 2009
The Wrestler," The Ram
","Basically, this superb character drama may not vary that much from similar stories, but, individually, scene for scene breathes a stark and uncompromising realism and earnestness, accentuated by Rourke's breathtaking performance. The warmth and vulnerability beneath his rough exteriors is perfectly captured.The other actors are also impressive and the director's untypically restrained attitude lets the plot unfold unhindered.Were it not for some slightly too contrived dramatic injections in the later stages, this'd be a straight masterpiece. But it's mighty good, anyway.8 out of 10 dreary autograph sessions",8,2,2,19 December 2010
Inception," Dream a Little Dream of Me
","Another phenomenally over-hyped blockbuster from Nolan, which - like all his movies - is nothing else but a pseudo-clever, emotionally cold and pompous high gloss product that's masquerading as intelligent mainstream entertainment.It's such fun to watch all the movie geeks and oh-so literate critics (and almost everyone in between) fall for well-packaged, but thoroughly trivial nonsense like this with such aplomb. It's as if all the stupid action movies and (romantic) comedies Hollywood is churning out regularly have led to a yearning for something more profound... though the big guns and larger-than-life stars are still not to be missed, of course.This one's in the same league as 'Matrix', though much more elaborate in its twisted ways. (Just listen to the constantly exchanged plot explanations between the characters, which get unintentionally funny after a while.) One watches pics like these applauding the makers, without investing deeper thoughts or emotions. One's much too puzzled to feel anything.By the way, this must've been the longest showdown I've ever seen in any movie. Afterwards, I felt like that ancient Asian guy.5 out of 10 ever-whirling roundabouts",5,27,50,11 August 2010
Sherlock Holmes," Middle-Aged Sherlock Holmes
","After decades of Holmesiana in serial, nostalgic, earnest and parodist fashion, a modern re-imagining of Conan Doyle's famous sleuth is definitely necessary. And to a certain degree, Ritchie's pic breathes fresh air into the old formula. Downey Jr.'s seriocomic depiction is closer to Holmes than many old-fashioned fans would admit. He and Law make a strong duo. And Victorian London is beautifully captured.But there's that ill-fated, shallow and repetitive narrative, full of overlong chase scenes and witless talk, lacking any sense of real mystery and melodrama while opting for a silly tale of pseudo-supernatural mumbo-jumbo instead.At least, the original stories' pulpiness had style. This one's just mindless fun.5 out of 10 passed out dogs",5,1,4,20 January 2010
WALL¬∑E," A Wasted Opportunity
","After half an hour of almost meditative atmospheric silent comedy build-up, complete with perfect use of sound effects, the plot kicks in and we're left with one of PIXARs least captivating story lines this side of 'Cars'.The computer-generated images are crystal-clear and marvelous to behold, but, compared to, say, 'Ratatouille' somewhat distancing, while the sledgehammer delivery of the eco-friendly message with all the obese robot-controlled ex-earthlings tends to overstay its welcome. Especially the second half with all the chasing and hiding suffers from lazy script-writing.Still, as with all PIXAR works, an enjoyable movie.6 out of 10 'Hello, Dolly!' songs",6,6,12,11 June 2009
Mary and Max," Pen Pals
","Both morbidly funny and truthfully sad stop-motion picture full of richly detailed, carefully executed sequences and an almost existential air to it.The design is a marvel in itself as are the pointedly drawn characters and the pitch-perfect voice cast. Sometimes the grim and loose storyline is getting close to wallowing in its own bleakness and cleverness, but the warmth and empathy the makers of this gem are contributing to their work wins you over.The sheer wealth of wonderful ideas, images and gags is awesome.8 out of 10 Noblet collections",8,2,5,29 August 2010
Toy Story 3," Day (S)Care Center
","Woody et al. are back for a final(?) installment in the immensely popular Toy Story franchise.While not up to the original's technical and narrative impact fifteen years ago, this pic's an improvement on the second part. The day care center dictatorship offers a welcome sinister subtext, that was missing in part two, and the by now well-embraced characters are still able to carry enough emotional heft. And technically, this one's a marvel to behold.Unfortunately, the emotional moments - the ending in particular - are not as effective as they ought to be, and the story's structure is all too similar to its predecessor's.Still, a fitting swan song to the trilogy.7 out of 10 Ken and Barbie love stories",7,0,0,24 October 2010
Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs," Hot and Cold
","This third installment of the reliably mediocre Ice Age franchise is just as non-descript and formulaic as its predecessors.The setting and the characters are likable enough and not without their charms and the pace is even faster than before - the whole pic is one big jump'n'run arcade game -, but the pseudo-story is thin indeed and the mostly juvenile jokes are only funny in fits and starts.Does anyone share my opinion of movie dinosaurs being particularly boring nowadays? Strictly by-the-numbers.5 out of 10 Captain Ahabs weasel style",5,0,2,6 October 2010
Beowulf," Poor Grendel
","Grim retelling of the famous epic poem with a hardly subtle myth-busting catch.The motion capturing is just as stiff and waxen as in Zemeckis' 'Polar Express'; the unsympathetic titular hero makes one actually root for the monsters, even if their mother's a witch who looks suspiciously like Angelina Jolie complete with high heels and a dreadful accent; and the sketchy narrative lacks real zest and fun, though certainly not violence and pseudo-nudity.At least, the pic slightly improves in the second half, the action scenes and several visual touches are okay and some of the voice work - acting's the wrong term in this case - adds a touch of class.4 out of 10 seduced kings",4,0,3,6 November 2009
Fantastic Mr. Fox," After the Fox
","Highly entertaining fox(y) caper with more of the director's quirks than Dahl's left intact, i.e. there's always enough room left for strange side glimpses into the character's spleens while the speedy narrative itself feels slightly mechanical and thin after a while. The good voice cast is of great help, though.But the most interesting aspect of Wes Anderson's first-time foray into feature-length stop-motion animation (though there were some animated sequences in earlier pics) is certainly the clash between wild-life instincts and a civilized way of living. The anthropomorphism we're used to in most animated movies surely gets scrutinized in this pic.As with all of Anderson's work, likably off-key, but somewhat distancing and too self-absorbed on the whole.6 out of 10 dumb opossums",6,0,1,14 February 2010
Up in the Air," Downsized Emotions
","Intelligent Hollywood entertainment for grown-ups is so rare nowadays that while watching this wonderful gem I was quite simply awe-struck.Apart from Clooney's most profound characterization so far - amongst a first-rate cast -, it's Reitman's assured direction and the witty and perceptive screenplay which deliver the goods.Every visual nuance is subtly handled, not a single scene goes on too long or feels jarring. There's a natural flow to the narrative, which puts across its timely message in a clear yet not too obvious way. And the customary final sugar-coating is reduced to a minimum, whereas emotional resonance takes the limelight.A pic that's really true to itself. Marvellous! 8 out of 10 million air miles",8,0,2,11 March 2010
