The Ring," Really weird, but amazing stuff here...
","I was extremely impressed with this movie. It has a big concept, a good balance of things and some good scares. It is very different and has weird parts to make it scary, like no other horror movie does. Everything seems to move very fast, which is on the edge-of-you-seat kind of style which is great. I like the cast and the acting. I like the use of light, an camera angles. I like the way at the end of each scary scene, it flicks through all of the images on the cursed tape very quickly (it does this 3 times throughout the movie). The suspense build-up causes fearful tension, and gives a sense of creepiness down you spine. I think this should be given a go to watch, even if horror movies scare the living daylights outta you. It's not THAT scary, it's very very well put together, and overall one of the best movies I have ever seen. Fantastic, give it a go!!!",10,1,2,11 December 2006
