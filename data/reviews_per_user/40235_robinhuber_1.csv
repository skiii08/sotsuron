Marie Antoinette," Sofia Coppola is Incompetent
","I had wanted so badly to like this film. I didn't care if it was historically correct. I didn't care if it was full of anachronisms (intended or not). I didn't care if it was politically correct. I wanted to like this film so much, I was willing to forgive almost anything. But I was completely unprepared for the big stinking piece of crap Coppola tried to pass as art. To call this movie boring, shallow and amateurish somehow doesn't do justice to this abomination. It felt like a privileged, vapid, self-absorbed high-school student was given millions of dollars to blow on a school project. How this movie got released is beyond me. Personally I will never see another film by this fraud of a writer/director. Time to change careers Sofia.",1,6,11,21 October 2006
