Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Somewhat disappointing, but the end scene made up for a lot.
","Even though I remained hopeful in the face of all the bad reviews I must admit i was disappointed in the movie as a whole. I hated jar jar binks...I could barely understand a thing he said. I loved the lightsaber action, but something was missing. I believe the more child like feel that Lucas gave to the movie was because Anakin is so young, and the next two have to be much darker. Darth Maul was of course excellent. I know Lucas will come back with a winner for episode II and III.Just please leave Jar Jar at home this time.",6,0,1,19 May 1999
Full Metal Jacket," The best Vietnam film.
","I don't understand how this movie did not make AFI's 100 greatest movies list. In my opinion this is in the top ten of most notable movies not included on the 100 years 100 movies list. The two other Vietnam movies that did make the list (Platoon and Apocalypse Now) are not nearly as good as Full Metal Jacket. Ah well enough crying over that. This movie is great in terms of acting, story, and just out right quotability. A must see for any movie fan. Kubrick is a masterful director, he will be missed.",10,0,0,22 June 1999
