Gremlins," I wish I had a Bathroom Buddy
","Possibly one of the greatest movies of the 80's, if not the last forty years.  Classic and influential, and what's best, it's still entertaining to watch even after all these years.The story concerns Billy (Zach Galligan), a young bank teller/free lance cartoonist whose father brings him home a rare creature as a Christmas present.  Gizmo, the creature in question, soon multiplies when he's splashed with water, and spawns a group of evil clones, led by Stripe. These creatures then transform into monsters and escape into town, causing all categories of chaos on Christmas Eve.Joe Dante successfully copies the same style he employed for his earlier film THE HOWLING and packs this movie with enough in-jokes for four movies. For all their grotesque physiques, the gremlins are somewhat cute, particularly when they watch SNOW WHITE and the SEVEN DWARFS, easily the film's most famous scene.But the movie's finest moment concerns the fate of Ruby Deagle, the town's evil old landowner.  Much like Aunt Edna in NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VACATION, you'll laugh rather then be appalled when the old nag gets her just desserts.All in all, if you've never scene this movie, you're missing out on one of the greatest motion pictures of our time.  Alternately scary and funny, sometimes in the same minute, it stands alone among all the horror/comedies of it's time, second only to GHOSTBUSTERS.  So get up right now and root for Gizmo and Billy as the fight the forces of evil.  You won't be sorry, I'll promise you that.",10,0,1,11 July 2000
Underworld," Action monster movie with lots going on, but nothing happening
","Is it just me, or are vampires not  allowed to be monsters anymore at the cineplex? Tortured souls longing for some form of salvation? Yeah. Entrepreneurs with an supernatural edge over the competition? Sure. Members of extended clans and families that spawn across the ages, hidden in secrecy in order to survive? Absolutely.But vicious, bloodthirsty demons who seek to corrupt the world with cheap promises of pleasure and who feed off the fear of others? Not likely. I suppose we have the success of Anne Rice's 'Vampire Chronicles' series to thank/blame for this, and with it the new mind set that being a vampire, although having a few drawbacks, is still pretty cool.Although it never verbally acknowledges this, that statement seems to be present in every frame of 'Underworld.' Vampires live lives of exorbitant wealth in gothic mansions, wearing full body leather suits and driving fast Mercedes Benzes. No more lurking in drafty castles for these creatures of the night -- if it doesn't have a multi-million dollar ballroom full of vampires seemingly just lounging around all day, then it can't be home.Kate Beckinsale plays Selene, a member of a special class of vampires known as 'Death Dealers' whose job is to hunt down and terminate werewolves with extreme prejudice. Vampires and werewolves have been fighting for centuries it seems, and Selene enjoys her job of taking out the competition. Fighting has severely decimated the werewolf ranks, which is fortunate since the time is drawing near to reawaken a noble vampire who will seemingly bring about the final destruction of the werewolf race.Trouble soon arises however when Selene discovers her lupine enemies are shadowing a seemingly normal human, hospital intern Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman). She soon intervenes, taking Michael hostage after saving him from the werewolf's leader Lucian, who is supposed to be dead. Selene's quest to discover the truth about Michael's role in the werewolf plot places some of her already shady superiors in an even more suspicious light, and puts both Selene and Michael in serious danger.Whoa! Catch all that? Don't worry, you won't have to worry about plot all that much. What people really came to see is Selene whipping out dual 9 mm automatics and emptying countless silver-tipped rounds into her werewolf adversaries, which happens in abundance in this film. The werewolves also pack heat that bears ammunition with concentrated ultraviolet light inside, and since vampires and sunlight don't mix...For those hoping for a film featuring werewolf/vampire hand-to-hand combat, however, prepare to be disappointed. The modern day Nosferatus and wolfmen are all trigger happy gunman, relying mostly on firepower instead of brute strength to do battle.That perhaps speaks the most about 'Underworld' and films of its kind. This is not a horror film, rather it's an action movie with monsters in it. There are definitely some gross werewolf attacks with horrific mutilations and the like, and the monsters definitely look intimidating, but scary? Hardly -- and for a supposed horror film that can be the unkindest cut of all.'Underworld' is a comic book style movie heavy in the film noir, with all the characters inhabiting some unnamed gothic city shrouded in darkness and gloom. It looks like the filmmakers watched 'Blade Runner' and 'Dark City' numerous times prior to filming, and the result is a story that takes place in a murky and depressing universe where happiness seems neither available nor desired.Beckinsale makes a sexy femme fatale but she can't quite bring her character Selene to life. She's all presence but no sympathy; a woman trying to invoke all the cool scenes from 'The Matrix' while lacking the human core. Speedman also goes through the motions as Michael, a man thrust into the middle of a centuries-old blood feud and forced to just nod in agreement or turn his head away in disgust whenever some other character on screen speaks. His purpose in the film is only cursory. He's a living MacGuffin for the vampires and werewolves to fight over.First time director Len Wiseman films 'Underworld' like a music video, with stylish slow motion shootouts, pulsating generic techno music and wardrobes seemingly thrown together from an Armani fashion show. The result is too much leather, gun blasts and needless eye candy for the brain to comprehend.Ultimately, the movie is two hours of unappealing characters snarling and fighting over who should rule a dreary and lifeless world -- something that might work as a video game scenario, but throw it up on the big screen and the pointlessness of the whole enterprise shines like a beacon.This movie a least proves that bloodsuckers and lycanthropes are still staples of the horror genre, but I suggest you watch 'Near Dark' or 'The Howling' if you want to see novel presentations of the vampire and werewolf communities. Here they're just members of rival gangs fighting over turf, with very little imagination thrown in to make the story unique or interesting.5 out of 10 stars. The movie is all dressed up with nowhere to go.",5,0,0,25 September 2003
Dawn of the Dead," 'Attention Shoppers! The mall is now closing forever..'
","How will mankind behave in the end times? Will we turn into raving lunatics and attack one another? Will we try to slavishly hold onto some fabric of our society? Will we kick back and accept what is happening?`Dawn of the Dead' in some ways tries to answer that question. The movie, a remake of George Romero's classic 1978 sequel to `Night of the Living Dead,' throws a group of people together while society crumbles around them and allows the viewer to watch as humans seek to survive an onslaught of the undead.The movie opens with the unimaginable happening. Hordes of zombies have overtaken Milwaukee and numerous survivors are both fighting off the monsters and trying to escape the city. One such group includes Ana (Sarah Polley), a nurse who is running scared after losing her husband, Kenneth (Ving Rhames), a tough-as-nails cop, Michael (Jake Weber), who tries to be two-steps ahead of any dangerous situation, and Andre (Mekhi Phifer), whose trying to care of his pregnant wife.Seeking shelter from the waves of zombie attacks, the group decides to head toward a local mall and hole up there until help arrives. Once inside they join with security guards and use the shopping center as a refuge from the undead while trying to piece together what's left of their lives.The plot is pretty straightforward, and relies mostly on clich√© themes to move the story along. So as a rule, most films such as this tend to be predictable and quite tepid. Luckily, `Dawn of the Dead' has strong personalities to fall back on, making it thankfully every bit a character-driven drama as it is a horror-action piece.As Ana, Polley convincingly plays a waif turned survivor with just the right amount of emoting. She is strong and vulnerable at the same moment, trying to remain reasonable in unreasonable times. Weber also fits this bill as Michael, a man with a shady past full of regret who tries to fill others with hope while remaining a stark realistic.Rhames' performance clearly commands the most attention. As Kenneth, he becomes the group's de facto leader and top man of action. He keeps the clearest head when trouble is afoot and leads the group out of one scrape after another. Rhames gives the character a silent strength that provides the film with a much needed human edge.First time director Zack Snyder moves the film along briskly and effectively, keeping the action scenes tight and the dramatic scenes quiet. There is no heavy-handed sermonizing here that tends to infiltrate most big-budget horror movies -- Snyder wisely lets the images speak for themselves.The horror itself is shocking and grabs your attention, which is a plus considering most of the recent crop of thrillers. The fact that it is happening to sympathetic characters that we care about is another feather in the movie's cap.All to often most horror movies are just excuses for numerous poorly developed characters to be killed in awful ways for the enjoyment of the audience. As far as recent zombie movies go, `Dawn of the Dead' thankfully remains closer to `28 Days Later' than `House of the Dead.'However, despite all the movie's strengths, it still pales in comparison to the original. Romero's `Dawn of the Dead' took the premise of people trapped in mall and used it to make some pointed social commentary about consumerism. The first '`Dawn' had human characters selfishly hoarding material goods for themselves, using the mall not only as a refuge from zombies but also as their own personal palace that provides them with more items than they could ever need.It's to the detriment of the new film that it never takes the concept to this level. Here, the story seems to take place in a mall because it's a cool place for a horror movie, not because it can draw out anything interesting in the characters themselves. Also, in the original the zombies wanted inside not only to eat the humans but also because they are drawn to the shopping center since is was an important place to them when they were alive.It's a shame that this time around viewers won't get the chance to see zombies wandering around JC Penney or stumbling up and down escalators, the joke being humans amble about aimlessly themselves like the undead at the mall.`Dawn of the Dead' is a very bloody and terrifying film but it lacks the superior gory effects from the 1978 movie. That should not stop the squeamish from twitching in their seats due to the horrific content onscreen.Good acting and smart thinking elevates the proceedings among most other horror offerings, but compared to Romero's original it lacks the observations necessary to make it a classic. The first film remains an intelligent critique on human actions during the apocalypse, while this is just a suspense drama that is dressed to kill.8 out of 10 stars. Not as good as Romero's original, but still one heck of a shot in the arm to cure the memory from most modern horror misfires.",8,125,176,29 March 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Well, blow me down! This movie ain't half bad!
","I entered `Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl' with mediocre anticipation.  Pirate movies are said that have a curse of their own, with a handful of such films failing miserably at the box office throughout the √Ç‚Äò90s.  With such low expectations, imagine my surprise when the movie turned out to be far from a turkey.Now that's not to say that this is a great film.  Heaven knows that for the past decade most Hollywood summer releases are essentially $100 million B-movies, and this is no exception.  The story is shoddy, the quips are many, and the special effects have a sort of `look at how fake I am!' feeling to them.But it is a rousing adventure, and for the most part, the cast eats up the proceedings with vigor.  Our film begins with young Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley) spotting a boy floating on a makeshift raft near the decimated remains of a ship.  The boy is pulled aboard Elizabeth's ship, which is currently transporting her father Governor Swann to a settlement in the New World.  She takes a pendant off the boy while he is unconscious, which has a suspicious looking gold coin attached to it.Flash forward eight years to our story proper, where Elizabeth is now blossoming into womanhood.  Despite the well-meaning interference of her father to arrange her marriage, Elizabeth's heart still lies with the boy, Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), who is now a blacksmith with a deep resentment of pirates which stems from his mysterious past.  Before the conflicting love triangle can come to a head, however, the fort comes under attack by the pirate crew of the Black Pearl, a supposed ghost ship that haunts the Spanish Main, and Elizabeth is taken hostage along with the pendant.Upset about the unwillingness of the British Navy to go after her, Will decides to enlist the aid of Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp), a pirate being held in the fort awaiting a hanging.  Sparrow is naturally more then eager to escape the gallows, and becomes especially intrigued when he discovers Will's name.  The two unlikely companions gather a scurvy crew and then set sail after the Black Pearl, Turner on a rescue mission and Sparrow seeking to settle a vendetta.The standard pirate movie cliches of forcibly boarding ships under naval engagements, talking parrots, sword fights and buried treasure abound, but the film has such a refreshingly energetic pace that every plot point seems fresh.Depp is the most pleasant surprise in this film, as a dishonored pirate who laughs at danger while reminding everyone that they're in the presence of greatness.  He manages to make Sparrow a unique character, with a laid back demeanor even during crisis and a strange loose limbed drunken-like gait that resembled the way he stumbled about in `Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.'  He takes a shine to young Will, playfully dropping hints about the boy's father's past.  Depp took what should have been a textbook role and brought life to what could have been a lackluster adventure tale.Geoffrey Rush also excels as the Black Pearl's Captain Barbossa, the leader of a supernatural crew of cutthroats searching the seas for the artifacts that will restore their mortality.  Rush is energetic but not hammy, and steals his scenes by underplaying his role instead of trying to fill the screen.  Along with Depp, he is the brightest star here.Bloom and Knightley are serviceable but not outstanding, certainly up to the task of the stunt work but not the human side of the story.  They're in love because the script says so, and there's little chemistry between the two.Apart from the Disney World ride the movie takes its title from, it probably owes equal parts of inspiration from `The Mummy,' `The Evil Dead 2,' and, because of all the skeletons, `Jason and the Argonauts.'  The movie offers a few unexpected surprises and charms, and stands out like a diamond in the rough against most summer dreck.  Plus you have to have to admire any film in the 21st century that delivers lines like `avast me hearties' and `shiver me timbers' with a straight face.",9,0,1,20 July 2003
Spider-Man 2," My Spidey-sense is all a-tingle!
","A good movie based on a comic book is rare, and a great one even rarer. Stories of larger than life heroes fighting against villains on epic scales is the keystone to a great adventure tale in any medium, but being able to adapt a thrilling comic into an equally thrilling movie has proven to be nearly impossible time and time again.'Spider-Man 2' is thankfully the exception, not the rule. Not only is this movie an excellent testament to a great superhero, it's also an improvement over the original film, which is quite a feat given how good that movie was.Being a superhero is beginning to take its toll on young Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire). Taking time out of his busy life to fight crime is costing him his relationships with love interest Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst) and best friend Harry Osborn (James Franco). His academic and professional lives are beginning to suffer as well, leaving Parker to wonder if he even needs to be Spider-Man anymore.At the same time, Dr. Otto Octavius (Alfred Molina) is planning on unveiling a new form of energy fusion with the financial help of Osborn. He has even constructed an elaborate device to wear on his back with long tentacles attached to it to help him manipulate the machine necessary to operate the fusion device. However, when an experiment goes terribly wrong, the device becomes fused to Octavius, who is soon driven mad.Dubbed 'Doctor Octopus' by the tabloid paper Parker shoots freelance photos for, Octavius insanely goes on a crime spree to raise funds for another experiment. Parker is forced to make a choice -- does he live out his own personal dreams, or must he sacrifice his desires and live up to the responsibilities that come with his power.The fact that 'Spider-Man 2' plays with the price it costs to be a hero is certainly what makes it so interesting. Not since the original 'Superman' movie has a superhero film series invested so much into developing the life of the normal, alter-ego. Peter Parker is clearly a real character, not just a liability that gets in the way of the Spider-Man action.The movie has some awesome set pieces as well, including a lengthy battle between Spider-Man and Doc Ock that has them fighting over skyscrapers, bridges and eventually an elevated train. It's a fight every comic book fan dreams of, over-the-top, brutal, and full of nasty surprises.Director Sam Raimi manages to invoke his inner demolition derby again, giving us the same insane camera work that he used to bring 'Evil Dead II' and 'Darkman' to life, only this time he's given more room to play. Raimi manages to pull off a miracle once again, making a movie that is completely his within the studio system, without compromising the integrity of the characters or disappointing fans.Once again, Maguire gives a heartfelt performance as both Parker and the wall crawler. He makes Parker clumsy, goofy, intelligent and heartbroken, and Spider-Man tough, determined and brave, pulling off both sides of the personality flawlessly.Dunst is amiable as Mary Jane Watson, but not really distinguished. She does give MJ a certain flair, and doesn't do anything to sabotage the character, but her performance never comes off as anything other than adequate.Series newcomer Molina on the other hand is at his scenery chewing best, doing his best villain take since playing Snidely Whiplash in 'Dudley Do-Right.' He makes Octavius deranged but motivated by a good cause, which gives his evil a certain added punch.Smaller parts do not go unappreciated, either. J. K. Simmons is funny returning as J. Jonah Jameson, the anti-Spider-Man newspaper editor who serves as the movie's comedy relief. Longtime Raimi collaborator Bruce Campbell also has humorous cameo as a theater usher on a power trip.Special effects are of course top notch again, especially each of Doc Ock's tentacles, which have a distinct snakelike appearance. The webslinging scenes are still a joy to watch on the big screen, as are the otherworldly battles.If 'Spider-Man 2' has any hindrances, its due to the sometimes hokey script and other unnecessary extras. The story turns maudlin whenever someone goes off on a tangent about the importance of responsibility or about how necessary a hero is needed. A funny scene involving Spider-Man in an elevator goes on a tad too long, and a wedding subplot is thrown in seemingly randomly and resolved just as quickly.Still, 'Spider-Man 2' remains the best superhero sequel since 'Batman Returns,' and perhaps the second best of all time behind 'Superman 2.' It's rare to see a summer blockbuster get so much right, especially this summer which so far has been high on spectacle and low on humanity.Heroism remains a needed ingredient in this Post 9/11 world. You can't help but notice the strong verve on screen as New Yorkers cheer on Spider-Man as he swings into battle. His is a struggle that is powerful because, as we know, under his costume he is still just a human being. If that doesn't resonate with audiences, I don't know what will.9 out of 10 stars. This is everything a good comic book movie should be.",9,0,0,29 July 2004
Alexander," Stone can't control his story or characters, and lets technical effects take over
","What profit a man to gain the whole world but lose his soul? Such is the conundrum of Alexander the Great, one of the world's great conquerors and subject of Oliver Stone's film 'Alexander.' Alexander (Colin Farrell) is the son of Macedonian king Philip (Val Kilmer), a hedonistic ruler obsessed with his own legacy. His mother Olympias (Angelina Jolie) is a shadowy Lady Macbeth, filling the boy with delusions of grandeur and plotting behind Philip's back. Alexander is torn between loyalties to his father, a strict pragmatist who sees suffering as the reward for greatness, and his mother, who sees him destined to rule the world.With war looming against the Persian Empire, Philip is assassinated and Alexander assumes control of the kingdom. He goes to war with Persia, conquering a superior force on the fields of Gaugamela and taking the city of Babylon as his prize. Not content with the spoils of war, he pursues the Persian king Darius into the wilderness with his army, including childhood friend turned sexual interest Hephaestion (Jared Leto).As Alexander conquers more lands to the east, his power and legend grows. However, turmoil among the ranks of his soldiers who fear they will never return home along with foolish political movies such as marrying Roxane (Rosario Dawson), the daughter of a 'savage' chieftain, strain his power to the breaking point. As Alexander becomes obsessed with bringing order to the known world, that same world seems ready to consume him at every turn.'Alexander' has all the trappings of a great historical epic, but somehow it never comes together. The editing is disjointed, the narrative clumsily jumps back and forth between different eras, and the narration by Ptolemy (Anthony Hopkins) seems in place to explain the shoddy scene transitions to the audience rather than give insight into the characters. The gay aspects of Alexander's life are sensationalized and not treated with much realism. This isn't an epic; it's a monstrosity whose parts are greater than the whole.To be fair, director Stone gives it his best shot. The movie certainly looks great, and the two battle scenes are handled with expert precision. But Stone can't keep his art house flourishes out of the movie. He insists on having close-ups of the eyes of wild animals, screws around with the film exposure and color tint and loads the film with enough of his trademark conspiracy theories to make five films.Farrell gives a good performance, but he's still not right for the part here. The role of Alexander demands someone with more power, and Farrell plays the character with too many flaws to be believable as one of history's greatest leaders. That may be more the fault of Stone however, who co-wrote the screenplay.Jolie and Kilmer are more interesting as Alexander's parents, but their presence amounts to little more than extended cameos. Leto has nothing to do except provide emotion support and fawn over Alexander. Dawson comes the closest to making an impact, but her character is sadly designated to the sidelines in favor of sequences of women dancing suggestively and gradual breakdown of morale among the men.If even a quarter of this film is true, then Alexander the Great was truly a progressive idealist for his time, envisioning a kingdom of equal citizens of all races. However, the message in Stone's film 'Alexander' comes off as too anachronistic and politically correct for the era in which it takes place. Like 2004's other ancient Greek epic 'Troy,' the movie is an all-star special effects laden event on a quest for a better plot.Six out of 10 stars. Stone's film is certainly lively, but the editing is off, Farrell is too petulant to be believable as one of history's great leaders, and it all collapses under it's own weight.",6,2,2,8 September 2005
Constantine," Interesting but flawed Gothic comic book tale
","Apparently God and the Devil made a bet. Not the one involving Job, but you'd think that after that debacle Satan would have learned his lesson. In any case, they both promised to stay in the background and simply influence people's actions, with the fate of mankind's souls being in a cosmic toss up. But every now and then, a demon decides to sneak around the rules.Within this neutrality agreement lie certain people with the ability to see what's really happening behind the scenes. One of these gifted few is John Constantine (Keanu Reeves), a chain-smoking world-weary rogue who uses his powers as a mercenary exorcist in Los Angeles. Constantine himself has been to Hell briefly, having committed the mortal sin of suicide before being saved by doctors, and now is trying to redeem himself by sending demons back where they came from. Recently diagnosed with lung cancer, it seems that time is running out for him to get back in the good graces of the Almighty.His life becomes complicated with the arrival of Detective Angela Dodson (Rachel Weisz), a police officer whose twin sister recently committed suicide. Dodson suspects some sort of foul play is involved, and Constantine reluctantly is forced to agree when he notices a high amount supernatural activity in effect.Realizing the balance is starting to shift toward the dark side, Constantine must decide if he can earn his way out of Hell on actions alone, or if there is something more to it then that.'Constantine' is a movie that almost gets it right in terms of storytelling. Based on the DC Comic 'Hellblazer,' the film has all the prerequisites for a good fantasy-action tale. But it only scratches the surface in showcasing this world that the characters inhabit, instead relying on Gothic, moody film noir atmosphere.First time director Francis Lawrence cranks up the action nicely, but is betrayed by a screenplay that assumes the audience is already familiar with the universe in which the story takes place. While it's nice to let the crowd fill in their own blanks in some cases, giving some meaning to the rules wouldn't hurt, either.Also strange is the weird mix of Christianity with Eastern principles such as dualism, that is that evil and good have equal powers in the universe and both are necessary to balance each other out. The two religious views just don't mesh with each other, and as a result the story doesn't really capture either very well.Reeves plays his role quite convincingly, perhaps because he already honed his 'outcast Chosen One' skills during 'The Matrix' trilogy. Burnt-out and perpetually throwing another cigarette in his mouth, at least when he's not coughing up lung tissue, Reeves manages to take a selfish, disreputable jerk and make him quite sympathetic. In the ten years since 'Speed' was released, he has grown into the role of action star quite nicely.Weisz basically does here what she did for Brendan Fraser in 'The Mummy' movies ¬ñ play second fiddle. While she does give Dodson some much needed angst, Weisz is trapped in stock character, and can't bring her to life. Far more interesting but sadly underused are Tilda Swinton as very androgynous angel Gabriel, and Peter Stormare who camps things up nicely as Satan. While more time with the former may have fleshed out the angel's motivations, too much more time with the latter may have worn out his welcome.'Constantine' beckons for a greater story to be told with these characters, and with any luck there will be. Just a personal nitpick, however. How come movies such as these have to be engulfed in Catholic imagery? Are there no Methodists ready to kick demon butt? Just asking.7 out of 10 stars. Reeves acquits himself nicely and the movie is still good despite a lackluster plot.",7,0,3,1 April 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," Special effects extravaganza marred by doomsday politics
","The typical disaster movie plays up our deepest fears and tries to balance them with human drama. At one minute people are running for their lives, the next they're cowered together, trying to outlast Mother Nature's fury.The elements are usually in place for a good story, but filmmakers tend to overdo the human aspects and end up making the movie melodramatic. 'The Day After Tomorrow' is certainly no exception, but thankfully the ultra-goofy dialogue that sunk NBC's recent disaster telepic '10.5' is mercifully kept to a minimum. Instead we have just a big, dumb action movie that's easy on the brain and filled with lots of visual treats.Nature is a harsh mistress, and it seems she had enough of our selfishness. Scientist Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid) specializes in studying the climate patterns of the Earth, and has detected what might be the first traces of a major shift in the temperature of the planet due to global warming. His statements are of course met with skepticism by the American government, particularly by Vice-President Becker (Kenneth Welsh, who looks too much like Dick Cheney for it to be a coincidence).Hall gets a sympathetic listener in Terry Rapson (Ian Holm) a fellow climatologist studying ocean temperatures. When his ominous warnings start to come true, Hall is forced to accept that the world may be heading for another ice age. Meanwhile, Hall's son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is in New York at an academic competition, which is in the path of a massive tidal wave that threatens to flood the city.'The Day After Tomorrow' is certainly loaded with some powerful images. Tornadoes destroy downtown Los Angeles, waters flood New York and then the city becomes a frozen tundra, and in one deliciously ironic moment thousands of Americans illegally cross the Rio Grande to sneak into Mexico.It is a well-intentioned film, but like all 'message-driven' movies its reasoning is absolute and the main characters are either fall into two camps: the noble idealists and the cynical curmudgeons.It's been six years since the last time director Roland Emmerich destroyed New York, and kudos to him for managing to do it again with flare. He directs the disaster scenes with a seasoned professionalism, making them both intense and frightening, and he thankfully manages to downplay the melodrama so it doesn't come off annoying.Quaid is the anchor that keeps this film together, and his performance as Hall is nicely even-keeled. He manages to almost make the conflict in this film believable, but he's still saddled with goofy emotional baggage. His estrangement with his son (a typical plot device in disaster films) is too ill-conceived and by-the-books to be powerful, as is the `heartwarming' decision of his wife (Sela Ward) to stay behind with a young cancer patient in the middle of a blizzard.Gyllenhaal turns in a nice performance as Sam, playing the survivor who, to the screenplay's credit, manages to use reason instead of self-righteous bullheadedness, though he still does a few stupid things as well. It's still a nice star turn for the young actor, and he pulls it off without insulting our intelligence too bad.But 'The Day After Tomorrow' ultimately suffers from the major problems evident in the disaster genre. Its politics are goofy, the special effects outweigh the human drama and most notably its views on social Darwinism are hypocritical at best.The movie suggests mankind should just accept that in catastrophes there's going to be massive casualties that people can do nothing to stop, but at the same time every attempt by the heroes to save the ones they care about, no matter how foolish a long shot it may be, is always smiled upon. Only in a disaster movie could a selfish decision such as leaving behind millions of people who need your help to seek out one's son be construed as altruistic and noble.The science of the film is of course far-fetched to say the least, suggesting a major world-wide climate change could occur within a few weeks. The fact is global warming still remains a touchy subject, one that can either be proven or disproven with different data. Plus it's always disheartening to see a movie use a straw man approach to discredit opposing viewpoints on the issue by making them come from the mouths of people driven by that dependable goal of every movie villain -- money.'The Day After Tomorrow' comes with controversy already built on the issue of global warming, but it's doubtful this movie will change many opinions. It certainly is a well made film with great special effects and likable main characters, but like all disaster movies it tries to scare people into submission. You better change your ways, or THIS could happen to you.Still, despite the shortcomings of the film itself, it is an powerful reminder that no matter what your thoughts on the greenhouse effect, the fact remains that mankind is completely at the mercy of nature. It's sobering to be reminded that despite our advances throughout the centuries, at any moment disaster can strike and render all our accomplishments moot.7 out of 10 stars. The movie is good for what it is, but please, less complaining about the evils of technology only to use that same technology when the survivors need it.",7,1,4,2 July 2004
Ocean's Twelve," A good cast's ego project calls horribly awry
","It's fitting that 'Ocean's 12' is about a heist; it feels like someone stole the cast and crew from the first film and placed them in an inferior movie. With such a talented group of actors assembled, it's a shame that this sequel lacks the inspiration that fueled the original.It's been three years since the team pulled off the $180 million heist in Las Vegas. Time has eventually caught up with them, and Terry Benedict (Andy Garcia) demands payback for his embarrassment. He gives Danny Ocean (George Clooney) and the rest of the gang two weeks to make good on the money they've stolen, or he's going to have them killed.So Ocean reassembles his team, including Rusty Ryan (Brad Pitt), Linus Caldwell (Matt Damon), Basher Tarr (Don Cheadle), and the rest. They head off to Europe to make some fast cash and repay Benedict. But there's a small problem. A rival thief who goes by the alias Night Fox (Vincent Cassel) is the one who tipped off Benedict, and holds Ocean and his team at his mercy. In a bid to find out who is the best, the Night Fox challenges Ocean's Eleven to steal the same prize that he is seeking.With no choice as to other jobs to take in such a short time, the team reluctantly accepts. However, a contingency pops up in the form of European detective Isabel Lahiri (Catherine Zeta-Jones), a former acquaintance of Rusty's who has vowed to put the group behind bars. The team is forced to outwit both the Night Fox and Lahiri while still under the time limit imposed by Benedict.'Ocean's 12' can't be blamed for trying. The first film was lighthearted enough with likable characters, but was a fully realized story that didn't demand a follow-up. The sequel in turn strains for credibility, and has trouble finding a coherent plot. The actual heist this time seems like kiddie stuff compared to the ultra coordinated caper in the original.Director Steven Soderbergh directs the film with the same indie flair he used in the original, but unfortunately, this time the plot comes crashing down on him. The story doesn't have the same fluid pace, and jumps around uncontrollably. Soderbergh does his best, and the parts that work are due to his vision, but he can't make the movie seem like anything more than just a series of interesting scenes.All the actors give a fine performance, but their parts seem less polished this time around. Clooney, Pitt and Damon are fun to watch, but unfortunately, they overshadow the rest of the actors. In fact, Bernie Mac, Elliot Gould, Carl Reiner and Shaobo Qin seem like they're hardly on screen at all. Julia Roberts returns in an almost thankless small part as Tess Ocean, who comes in to help the team. Cassel on the other hand is delightfully hammy.But the characters can't really save a plot line that seems desperate. Some history tells the story behind that. The screenplay was once an original story, however Warner Bros. tapped the screenwriter to rewrite the story to fit a sequel for their hit original 'Ocean's 11.' This speaks volumes toward the sometimes shoddy storytelling and forced plot contrivances.'Ocean's 12' probably won't have the same lasting power as the original. It's certainly fun to watch, and the characters are still a joy to see in action, but the talent that is on screen and behind it is what's driving this film, because the plot sure isn't. There are some neat twists and turns along the path, but the real theft being committed here is on the audience, whose good memories of the first film have been stolen and replaced with this inferior sequel.5 out of ten stars. Might have been way better if the actors and filmmakers were concerned with the audience having as much fun watching it as they had making it.",5,1,2,18 April 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," Give me the blue pill, I want to get out of here!
","It was inevitable. Another promising trilogy comes to a somewhat mediocre conclusion, though not quite as disappointing as it could have been. In fact, in the end the trilogy delivers exactly what it promised, nothing more, and nothing less.Well perhaps a little more, but 'The Matrix Revolutions' is mostly all build up for little payoff. The movie features some pretty amazing scenes and offers a satisfactory conclusion, but was the ending really what all the fans wanted to see?The final arc in the story picks up with the Sentinel machines continuing on their journey to destroy Zion, mankind's last stronghold during an apocalyptic war between humans and machines. Neo (Keanu Reeves) is continuing to discover purpose both inside the Matrix and outside and must make some hard decisions during what promises to be the last struggle between man and machine.Fellow humans Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), Niobe (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) must also choose between helping Neo or coming to the aid of their city. Their faith in the prophecy of The One shaken, they must decide if their fate is truly being decided by Providence or if their struggle is both aimless and futile.Meanwhile former Matrix agent turned rogue Smith (Hugo Weaving) is still seeking out his own purpose, threatening both the machines and mankind as he attempts to become the most powerful being in the system.This all leads to a conclusion that is absolutely stunning to watch but delivers next to nil on the emotional side. 'The Matrix Revolutions' is a comic book movie for people who just want to watch action, but even they get cheated on that. The first hour is talk-talk-talk with the people of Zion discussing their futures while the resistance struggles to discover their ultimate purpose.This might all seem urgent and important if the viewer actually felt something for the human's struggle, but such is not the case. Mankind in this film is seemingly devoid of empathy and the actors all say their lines as though their life has been sucked out of them.Perhaps it's the fact that all the humans we see are all former hackers and web surfers that they seem so soulless, but must every character deliver their lines in Zen-like monotone?It was okay in the first movie when it was just Morpheus and Trinity, but now that we've gotten a look at the rest of mankind, it's kind of hard to sympathize with their plight. We root for them because they're the good guys, but the ultimate irony here is that most humans here do in fact act like machines. Whether or not this was a bit of subversive humor on the filmmakers' part is up to the viewer.As Neo, Reeves delivers his full range of emotions, from stoic to ultra-stoic. Reeves has never given a lazy performance per se, it just seems that way since the extent of his acting abilities has always been to look either cool, sexy, surprised or all of the above. However I believe that only he could have brought Neo to life, and his efforts do not go completely un-rewarded.Fishburne and Moss are still Reeves' back-up singers as Morpheus and Trinity. They do their job as both fighters and psychobabble merchants, but when it's time for us to feel for them, they can't ante up the same effort. Moss is herself given a soliloquy late in the film that is meant to be heart moving, but ends up taking too long to say what the viewers already know and proves we always liked her best when she was beating people up, not professing her true feelings.Weaving still makes Smith a likeable villain but even he is giving the shaft in favor of endless exposition. However, when he is finally given his moment to shine during a battle on which the fate of mankind rests, he unfortunately becomes a cackling super villain.The battle scenes are all spectacular eye candy, particularly an assault on Zion that will delight any action aficionado. A nightclub shootout will satisfy fans as well, though it will not go down in history like the lobby gunfight in the original movie. A lengthy and epic fistfight also pales in comparison to the ones in the previous films.The ending, though confusing, does offer up some answers to questions that have been present in the series. The semi-religious aspects of Neo's destiny also unfold in a not-so-subtle way. It is interesting to see a mainstream movie end the way this one does, though some may wonder if the series was ultimately worth the hubbub at all.'The Matrix Revolutions' closes the series on a more human note than the previous film but still lacks the spark of the original. 'The Matrix' promised more than it could deliver and the trilogy will ultimately be remembered for the advances it created in special effects, not storytelling. Still, gaining immortality in this age is indeed something to be celebrated, an area in which this trilogy will never be in want.Six out of ten stars. If Neo had know that the free members of humanity were all mindless ravers and pseudo-Zen speaking philosophers, he would have downed the blue pill with a shot of Tequila.",6,0,0,18 November 2003
The Thing," One of the best (and most influential) horror movies of all time
","There is no question about it, THE THING is one of the best horror movies ever made.  This film is the culmination of director John Carpenter's talents; a truly horrific tale that will keep you up at night.An isolated Antarctic research station is the site of the film, where a skeleton crew of biologists and researchers find that a shape shifting alien is among them.  No one can trust anyone as the monster purposely pits the men against one another.The monster is downright scary to look at, and monster creators Stan Winston and Rob Bottin uses their special effect skills to the max.  Kurt Russell is in top form as the voice of reason (or the closest thing you can find to one in this place of terror).  Keith David and Wilford Brimley are also excellent standouts in this talented cast.Ignore the fact that the film originally bombed at the box office; that was due to E.T. opening before it and changing the image of aliens into a more family friendly appeal.  I have never seen another film that has captured paranoia so well.  This truly is one of the finest films the horror genre has ever produced, and you can tell by how many times is ripped-off (THE RELIC, DEEP RISING, VIRUS, etc) that it is highly influential.If you haven't seen it, you're missing one of the finest scary movies ever.",9,1,2,3 February 2000
The Dirty Dozen," Awesome action flick that reinvented the genre
","The Dirty Dozen is by far one of the best action movies of all time.  It takes quite a while for the actual gunfighting to hit, but once it does, it comes with a vengeance.This was the first 'war' movie ever to not focus on the actual  war, but a small section of it. These men were not going behind enemy lines to capture an enemy outpost or liberate a village , they were going in to destroy a chateau and all the Germans in it.Good cast led by Lee Marvin, with other such standouts as John Cassevettes as Franco and Charles Bronson as Wladislaw as two of the most prominent prisoners in the group.The film has only aged just a tad with time, but it remains an awesome movie that reinvented the genre of action.  This film along with THE WILD BUNCH helped make the shootout finale now part of Hollywood culture, and it still manages to tantalize the senses.This is a great movie about loyalty, duty, the cost of war, and even redemption.George Kennedy: 'They lost their lives in the line of duty!'",10,1,4,30 May 1999
Alien vs. Predator," Fun monster action from two popular series, but human scenes and isolated settings dampen the show
","Movies made for fanboys are often a disappointing enterprise, but such is not always the case. Every now and then, a studio manages to get something right, especially when the premise is so intriguing it would be nearly impossible for it to fail.Nearly. 'Alien vs. Predator' is a testament to the durability of both film series, not quite the best realization of the idea, but still a very entertaining movie. Where it lacks the suspense of the earlier films, it makes up for in a sheer pleasure of witnessing a long awaited grudge match.The Weyland Company has recently discovered an ancient pyramid located 2000 feet below the surface of Antarctica. Company CEO Charles Weyland(Lance Henriksen) has gathered together a team of explorers and adventurers to excavate down to the pyramid and explore the site. They include Alexa Woods (Sonaa Lathan), an expert on the Antarctic environment, Sebastian de Rosa (Raoul Bova), an archaeologist who specializes in civilizations with pyramids, and Greame Miller (Ewan Bremner), a photographer who comes along to document the event.However, upon arriving at the site they discover that a hole has already been dug, as if it was in anticipation of their arrival. Once they enter the ancient structure, they quickly realize that it is actually a hunting ground. Two rival extraterrestrial species, one the warrior breed Predators and the other, the both insect-like and reptilian Alien xenomorphs, are at war with each other. The explorers quickly deduce they've been led into a trap, and must find a way out the pyramid while simultaneously dodging attacks from both killer species.'Alien vs. Predator' is the type of film made specifically for the fans and people of morbid curiosity. Like 2003's 'Freddy vs. Jason,' the movie will divide up the viewers between their preferred monsters. I myself am an Alien man, but am open-minded enough to cheer on the Predators as well.Unfortunately, there isn't much here that we haven't seen before, and furthermore, the movie lacks the kinetic edge that the original films in both series possessed. This is an action movie, but a dark and disturbing one at that. Still, the story moving this whole enterprise is basically just a gimmick, not a plot.The movie also makes some nods to a few other sci-fi horror movies. The Antarctic location is obviously an homage to 'The Thing,' and the pyramid, a death trap whose rooms are constantly moving around, is most likely a nod to 'Cube.'As Woods, Lathan is smart, resourceful and tough but still vulnerable. She's obviously meant to be the Ripley character, though she unfortunately lacks Sigourney Weaver's human edge. Lathan is up to the challenge, and it's neat to see her in this sort of environment after doing dramas like 'Love and Basketball.'Henriksen is fun in the role of the billionaire adventurer who wants his immortality. As the only real established actor amongst this cast, he adds a level of professionalism that would otherwise be missing. His role is also an inside joke for fans for the Alien series.The other actors are competent, but not special. Most of them are just fodder for the monsters, but Bova manages to make an impression as the Italian archaeologist looking for a missing link between the different pyramid civilizations, only to find that he's sorry to discover just what it is.Director Paul Anderson has a long history of making films such as these, including his own 'Alien' homage 'Event Horizon.' He is proficient with creating atmosphere and he keeps things moving along nicely, especially in the second half when the actions starts to kick in, but he lacks fellow 'Alien' series helmer Ridley Scott's ability to build unnerving suspense, or James Cameron's all-out knock down actions scenes. From the 'Predator' camp, he's also deficient in John McTiernan's gung-ho machismo.'Alien vs. Predator' is not intelligent entertainment. In fact, it's unlikely it will have much of an audience outside the real die hards of each series. It's been 14 years since the last time Predators have been on screen, and seven for Aliens. Still, various different mediums have kept both series alive, and Aliens and Predators have battled before in both novels and comic books for the last decade or so.It's a fun movie to watch, and there are some unsettling moments. Also, there's one creature in the film that manages to come off sympathetic, or at least as sympathetic as either of these creatures can be. It's a nice, unexpected twist in an otherwise mundane plot.You'll either like 'Alien vs. Predator' or you won't. There's not really much middle ground here. Plus, some of the hard-core fans may be turned off by the PG-13 rating, thinking it will be a watered down version. Rest assured though, there's still plenty of blood and gore, but mostly alien blood at that.While it is fun, the movie may also be a disappointment to those expecting some epic battle between the species. What we have here is an isolated pit fight, not an all out war like the ads seem to suggest. The fights are intense but usually one-on-one, and can be over pretty quickly at times. Still, for those of you who are curious, 'Alien vs. Predator' is certainly worth hunting down.Six out of ten stars. A very fun movie to watch with great atmosphere, but it's not an all-out war between species and the human characters are just fodder to get between the different monsters.",6,1,4,8 September 2005
Seabiscuit," An old-fashioned winner all the way
","It's fitting that a film about underdogs giving it all they've got has been released among the standard summer action fare. No other movie this summer has capitalized upon the David vs. Goliath theme so thoroughly and effectively as `Seabiscuit' has.The story of `Seabiscuit' is actually the tale of four long shots: Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), a wealthy self-made man and natural salesmen who's suffered both personal and financial loss through the Depression, Tom Smith (Chris Cooper), an aging horse trainer unsure of his place in the world with the ending of the frontier, Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), a short-tempered jockey with various handicaps against him, and Seabiscuit, an undersized mustang whose been mistreated his whole life.It's the Depression, and times are hard on everyone. The assembly line philosophy of business is starting to squelch independent spirit and people are looking for anything to help escape the dreary day-to-day of life. During this maelstrom of hopelessness, horse racing quickly gathers favoritism among those wishing to witness a spectacle in otherwise bleak times. It's under these circumstances that the film's four main parties come together. Howard, seeking a new business venture in horse racing, hires Smith as his horse trainer and Pollard as his jockey, and upon Smith's insistence, purchases the ill-tempered Seabiscuit.It's not long before Seabiscuit becomes the `little horse who could,' gaining favor among the sporting fans on the West Coast. But despite the popularity the mustang and his team gains, they are seen as just a cheap novelty by the East Coast horse racing elite, led by Samuel Riddle, owner of the 1937 Triple Crown Winner War Admiral. This mushrooms into a media circus as Howard tries to gain public favor in order to force Riddle to put his money where his mouth is.The story should have felt cliched and by-the-numbers, but a funny thing happened: the film makers took a nearly forgotten moment in time and managed to invest it with immediacy and suspense. The near mythic meeting of Seabiscuit and War Admiral on November 1, 1938 at Pimlico is an extension of the movie's overall theme; Seabiscuit, the representative of underdog hopes and pioneering dreams, and War Admiral, the recipient of champion breeding and training, a product of assembly line thinking.Bridges and Maguire give spirited performances, with their characters forming a father and son bond that both men desperately needed. Cooper, who won this year's Best Supporter Actor Oscar, can give this kind of performance in his sleep, bringing a quiet, stoic depth to the Smith character. The supporting cast is top drawer as well, especially William H. Macy as `Tick Tock' McGlaughlin, the initially skeptical radio sports commentor who becomes a full blown Seabiscuit supporter.Director Gary Ross captures the time period marvelously, with broken human beings slowly recapturing their dignity and pride against a landscape of barren ruin. The conflicts are fought not on traditional battlefields, but atop magnificent beasts along a circular track, and Ross wisely utilizes this metaphor to full effect.Many film goers this season will most certainly pass on `Seabiscuit,' choosing instead to see standard fare like `American Wedding' and `Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life.' Others will undoubtedly avoid it because it looks to artsy to be entertaining. For whatever reason, it will be a shame that this film will not do well financially; the horse race scenes are some of the most intense I've ever seen, and the animals are pure poetry in motion.9 out of 10 stars. A nearly flawless motion picture.",9,67,79,13 August 2003
The Incredibles," PIXAR continues to prove its skill with this exciting, thought-provoking superhero cartoon
","It would seem impossible for an animated film to successfully combine family quarrels, mid-life crises and living in a world that squelches excellence along with the exploits of superheroes, but somehow, Pixar's 'The Incredibles' manages to get it done, and done right.Mr. Incredible's life is in shambles. Driven underground along with the rest of the Earth's champions, he is forced to live incognito in a world where superheroism has for all intents and purposes been criminalized due to excessive lawsuits from people claiming to have been harmed by their exploits. Using his alter ego Bob Parr (voice of Craig T. Nelson), Mr. Incredible now works as an insurance claims adjuster.His wife Helen, the superheorine Elastigirl (voice of Holly Hunter) has been rendered a stay-at-home mom, looking after their superpowered offspring Dash (voice of Spencer Fox), who can run at superspeed, and Violet (voice of Sarah Vowell), who can turn invisible and create forcefields. They are all being smothered in the suburban setting, forced to hide their powers and accept life in an increasingly mediocre world.That is until Mr. Incredible is contacted by a mysterious woman named Mystique, who is in need of a superhero. Deciding to relive his glory days, he sneaks behind his family's back to do super deeds. Helen becomes suspicious, but discovers too late what her husband has been doing. It seems a supervillain named Syndrome (voice of Jason Lee) has been behind the plot to get Mr. Incredible active again. She heads out to rescue her husband, but must also contend with her children who have snuck aboard her plane.As far as a superhero story goes, 'The Incredibles' is downright amazing. Every clich√© is covered, from the island lair to the cackling villain who was a former admirer of the superhero, however they are all dealt with in such a snappy manner that one doesn't really care that it has been done before.Furthermore, this isn't just a movie about a family of superheroes, it's about family bonding as well. It expertly handles the mid-life crisis angle, having Bob and Helen both feeling stifled. Bob's desire to relive his youth puts him at odds with his family, and he must decide what is more important to him.Sometimes fantasy can touch on social commentary better than most drama does, and 'The Incredibles' does that fine as well. The filmmakers use the plot as a clever ploy to make some sharp comments on American culture. Such as how excellence is routinely suppressed in favor of conformity, with everyone being forced to lower their standards out of fear of self-esteem damage to the less gifted. Bob remarks at one point 'They're constantly finding new ways to celebrate mediocrity,' and one can't help but nod in agreement.The voice acting is top notch, with Nelson providing the right tone to suggest both an overstressed white-collar drone as well as a superstrengthed champion of justice. Hunter brings a surprisingly nuanced performance to her character Helen, and manages to handle both the mom and superheroine duties effectively. Lee is wonderfully sadistic in the villain role, reminding us of his smarminess in Kevin Smith's films. Fox and Vowell bring life to their characters as well, which is commendable among actors their age, and Samuel L. Jackson is funny as Mr. Incredible's ice shooting superhero friend Frozone.Pixar has really outdone themselves this time, bringing moviegoers a film that is, well, incredible. While it's not quite as good as 'Finding Nemo,' what movie could be? It's action-packed, suspenseful, and full of positive family values, plus it's just a hoot to watch. 'The Incredibles' will appeal to anyone with a hero inside of them.",9,0,1,2 December 2004
School of Rock," For those about to rock, we salute you!
","Rock movies that manage to be truly insightful are rare. Kid's movies that happen to be sincere and honest are even rarer. Mixing the two genres together could have conceivably ended up as a critical nightmare.But `The School of Rock' fuses the two categories together into a film that is funny, touching, energetic, and most important, does indeed rock.Time has not been kind to rocker Dewey Finn (Jack Black), who has just been fired from his position of lead guitar in a rock band because the rest of the group feels his on-stage antics are out of place in the 21st Century. To top it off, he still crashes at the apartment of his buddy Ned Schneebly, who has grown out of the rock 'n roll age and become a respectable substitute teacher.Faced with the unfortunate prospect of getting a real job so that he can fork over his share of the rent, Dewey pretends to be Ned when answering a phone call and excepts an urgently needed teaching position at a local prep school. He soon butts heads with the school principal Rosalie Mullins (Joan Cusack), who's stern but amicable, and also shocks his fourth grade students with his flagrant disregard for traditional classroom protocol.Dewey at first sees his job as nothing more than a baby-sitting gig and is content to let the kids run free all day long, all the while trying to put together his own band to compete in an upcoming rock competition. Just when he's about to give up hope, however, he realizes the children in his class are talented musicians, at least in a classical music sense, and the bass guitar in his brain soon strikes the right note.Dewey plans to mold his little class of 10-year-olds into the ultimate rocking band, all the while promising them that they're training for a secret school project. They include teacher's pet and general smarty pants Summer (Miranda Cosgrove), who Dewey assigns as band manager, socially awkward Lawrence (Robert Tsai) who quickly makes the transition from piano to keyboard, introverted Zack (Joey Gaydos) who moves from acoustic to electric guitar and class showoff Kevin who gets to become the drummer.`The School of Rock' works because it is clever, observational and never condescending to its audience. Dewey is shocked to discover a whole generation of kids who have never heard of Led Zeppelin or The Who, and thinks the full scope of all musical entertainment revolves around MTV.The film's biggest mistake could have been making the children all typical Hollywood kids, which come in the form of either perfect little angels or out of control hellions. These children, however, all behave like real kids and the movie is better for that. As in real life there are attention seekers, like Summer and Kevin, shy kids afraid to express themselves like Lawrence, Tomika (Maryam Hassen) and Katie (Rebecca Brown), and children yearning for their parents' acceptance like Zack.Black easily walks away with the whole movie as Dewey, a tried and true rocker who hands out classic rock CDs to his class as homework and feels a rock song just isn't right unless it has a wicked guitar solo. Black is a livewire on camera, the modern answer to John Belushi and the proof that geeks, not cool people, are the ones who truly rule the rock 'n roll scene.The children also all give heartfelt performances, and quickly learn from Dewey to ditch pop divas and jam to the gods of rock. Cosgrove plays Summer as just the right balance of confidence and control freak, and Gaydos makes Zack a believably sad but determined child. Needless to say the children all give strong characterizations to their roles, and the movie is all the more likable because of this when they are ultimately triumphant.Many may accuse Houston-born indie director Richard Linklater of selling out with this mainstream offering after a decade of art house projects, but he clearly has his heart in every frame. The story may be formulaic but Linklater is able to get good performances out of everyone, and movie rolls along with a nice pace. The result is a movie where the use of classic rock hits like Led Zeppelin's `The Immigrant Song' and AC/DC's `Back in Black' seems earned, and not just tacked on by studio execs to please the demographics.`The School of Rock' may not be a rock masterpiece, but it is definitely destined to be an underground hit for years to come. This is an entertaining film the whole family should enjoy, and for those filmgoers who chose to rock, we salute you.Eight out of ten star. Jack Black and the kids make this movie a great fusion of 'To Sir, With Love' and 'This is Spinal Tap.'",8,0,0,10 October 2003
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Tarantino's samurai flick delivers what it promises, and how!
","Honor, betrayal and revenge are three traits that are renowned throughout all literature and media. But perhaps no culture has so thoroughly examined these issues to the point that rules have been established on all of them as the Japanese have.That is perhaps what led avant-garde director Quentin Tarantino to make a modern day samurai movie, with the Bushido code of honor still fully intact among today's assassins. Tarantino's three previous films 'Reservoir Dogs,' 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Jackie Brown' have all dealt with the three traits, but from a decidedly American standpoint. Add that to the fact that he grew up watching chop sockey flicks during his formative years, it's little wonder why he would be drawn to make such a film.'Kill Bill: Vol. 1' is an unapologetic throwback to the low budget and violent kung fu theater flicks of the late 70s, but mixed with all the weird idiosyncrasies we've come to expect from Hollywood's favorite indie director. The story is told in chapters that are out of order, characters have seemingly inappropriate civil conversations during the middle of chaos, people are tortured for information and sometimes just for the heck of it, and bad guys compete with each other over who is the ultimate villain.In this strange world or honor and insanity we meet 'The Bride,' (Uma Thurman) a former member of a hit man team known as Deadly Viper Assassination Squad where she went by the code name 'Black Mamba.' The rest of her squad ambushes her and her guests on her wedding day under mysterious pretenses not yet completely known, leaving her for dead. She miraculously manages to survive the ordeal, and four years later awakes from a hospital in El Paso, hungry for revenge.Black Mamba soon begins her long journey of hunting down her enemies, which include O-Ren 'Cottonmouth' Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita 'Copperhead' Green (Vivica A. Fox), Elle 'California Mountain Snake' Driver (Daryl Hannah), Budd 'Sidewinder' (Michael Madsen), and of course the mysterious ringleader Bill (the as of yet unseen David Carradine). She really only wants these top five figures, but is more than willing to put down anyone who stands in her way as well.Strong character development takes a back seat to violence and mayhem, which is sort of strange for a Tarantino flick. The characters are all interesting and unique, but this is not meant to be a deeply thought provoking experience. This is pure style over substance, with characters hacking each other apart with swords, knives and other weapons all for the benefit of the audience.The film succeeds best when it is playing the material straight. Legendary Japanese action star Sonny Chiba has a small but wonderful role as Hattori Hanzo, a near mythic sword maker who crafts a special blade just for Black Mamba.Tarantino, however, can't seem to control himself here. There are numerous comic scenes included with little rhyme or reason, such as a dirty hospital orderly who pimps out comatose patients to truckers, a scene where Hanzo keeps yelling at his lazy underling, and a lengthy scene in a parking garage where Black Mamba tries to regain control of her legs after four years of idleness.Also, a ten-minute ultra violent anim√© sequence detailing the origin of O-Ren Ishii seems added for just the heck of it.Tarantino definitely has his tongue planted firmly in cheek here, especially in the battle sequences. Victims who are decapitated or lose limbs spray out gallons of blood from their gashes in a disgustingly over-the-top fashion.Not since the battle between King Arthur and the Black Knight in 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail' or the lawnmower finale of 'Dead Alive' has so much of the red stuff spurted out of open wounds. Audiences will either react to such scenes by losing their lunch or laughing hysterically.Really, the only way to enjoy 'Kill Bill' is if you have a very sick sense of humor, and even then it's kind of hard to laugh at somebody lying on the ground screaming while blood oozes from a severed arm. Still, Tarantino knows who his audience is, and anyone who fits that demographic will have a blast.The cliffhanger ending will entice others while leaving other people feeling cheated. But then, the whole movie is a rather schizophrenic affair. On one hand, it's nice to see a movie where you don't know what will happen next, on the other, the mixture of slapstick and extremely gory death scenes may be offsetting to most viewers.I look forward to the second half of 'Kill Bill' in February, though I'm not honestly sure why. Tarantino has certainly crafted an original picture here, but I doubt many people will think it lives up to the hype. As an exercise in extreme violence and revenge, the film is a full throttle blast, but as the latest film from one of Hollywood's most celebrated directors, it's just a strange detour.8 out of 10 stars. Though at times it is an excessive assault on the senses, it's unique enough by itself to be visionary.",8,0,0,19 October 2003
The Last Samurai," Cruise and Watanabe conquer with great performances
","It is said that the only thing constant is change. Old ideals die off, and new technologies replace the inefficiencies of yesteryear. The young usually have little trouble adjusting to change, but traditionalists are often dragged into the new era either kicking and screaming or silently resolved to remove themselves completely.'The Last Samurai' manages to capture a little of both, with Japanese men living in a world in transition from ancient bushido rituals of honor into a more modern empire of industry and trade. A sweeping historical epic that hints at the brilliance of Akira Kurosawa's finest work while also invoking the melancholy of a Shakespearean tragedy, the movie is a reminder of the cost of high ideals and danger of industrial conformity.It's 1876, and Captain Nathan Algren (Tom Cruise) is an alcoholic wreck of a man. A veteran of the Civil War as well as General Custer's Indian campaigns, he drifts from one situation to another ostensibly looking for work but really seeking refuge from his inner demons of slaughtering innocent women and children.Opportunity knocks in the form of an old Army acquaintance Colonel Ben Bagley (Tony Goldwyn), who has accepted work with a Japanese businessman named Omura (Masato Harada). Omura has been charged with recruiting American war vets as military advisors to the new Japanese Army. Emperor Meiji, under advise from Omura and other parties, is interested in modernizing his nation's military with rifles and other armaments.In order to unify the nation, the powers that be must first take care of civil dissidence within Japan. The samurai, led by charismatic chieftain Katsumoto (Ken Watanabe), are violently opposing the invasion of Western culture into their islands. Bagley foolishly sends his ill-trained soldiers into combat against the samurai, and during the resulting massacre Algren is captured and taken to the samurai's village.During the course of the winter, Algren slowly gains the trust of his captors and in turn is given free roam over the village. He fights with Uijo (Hiroyuki Sanada), who dislikes the American from the beginning, and is given food and shelter by Taka (Koyuki), the wife of one of samurai he killed during battle.Katsumoto meanwhile seeks to learn about his enemy, and begins to respect Algren as a fellow warrior. Also interested in the American is Katsumoto's son Nobutada (Shin Koyamada), intrigued by Western culture. Algren finds the first peace he has known in a long time, and begins to adapt to the ways of the samurai. He acts as a surrogate father to Taka's children, learns to sword fight with a kitana blade and begins to respect the culture that he originally sought to destroy.But during Algren's absence the Japanese Army has had better opportunity to prepare themselves, and time is soon approaching that will determine the fate of the samurai and the future of Japan.'The Last Samurai' is beautifully filmed by John Toll, the same cinematographer who worked on 'Braveheart.' The comparisons are obvious with moments of silent reflection and loud explosions of fury, both powerfully captured on film.Director Edward Zwick brings the same determination to the screen that he did more than a decade ago with 'Glory.' The attention to period detail is near flawless and the movie never releases its grip on the audience.As Algren, Cruise grows from suicidal depression to driven idealist quite realistically, drawing on the standard dishonored warrior archetype while giving him touches of humanity. Cruise's only shortcoming is his lack of dramatic range, and as such it never seems like Algren has any sinister intent even when acting selfishly. Never for a moment is there a doubt that he's destined to be a hero.Cruise is also overshadowed in every scene by Watanabe, who makes Katsumoto a honorable man who is shocked by all the dishonor threatening to overthrow his country. Philosopher, poet, family man and warrior - Katsumoto wears many hats, and is realized through Watanabe perfectly.Other smaller roles are captured by strong performances as well, including Goldwyn who brings class to the standard villain role as Bagley, Koyuki who plays Taka with quiet sadness and torn loyalties between her fallen husband and his killer who she is growing to love, and Koyamada who makes Nobutada young and headstrong but still sympathetic and honorable.'The Last Samurai' only suffers during a protracted finale that screams of studio interference. The ending smacks of being safe, clean and Hollywood, something that almost betrays to whole film.The movie is still strong enough to become a modern day classic. Like 'The Wild Bunch,' it speaks to those curious of what became of warriors who outlived their time. Timeless issues of honor, loyalty and redemption as well as the clashing of ancient culture versus new technology remain omnipresent. To remain in the past in foolish, but to forget it entirely is disgraceful.Nine out of ten stars. Destined to be remembered for some time, this movie honorably deals with its subject matter.",9,221,367,14 December 2003
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," The circle is complete with a new 'Star Wars' film worthy of the name, finally
","'The Revenge of the Sith' not only undoes the harm inflicted on the 'Star Wars' universe that its two predecessors did, it justifies the entire second trilogy. The power and energy of the original films flows through every frame of this latest installment, and fans finally have a new movie that they can fully appreciate.The Clone Wars has left the Republic in dire straights. Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and the rest of the Jedi suspect that Chancellor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid) is abusing his power to make his position permanent. Anakin Skywalker (Hayden Christensen) meanwhile is falling closer under the control of the Chancellor, whose corrupting influence is warping the young Jedi's sense of values.Meanwhile, his wife Padm√© Amidala (Natalie Portman) confides in Anakin that she is pregnant, and he starts having disturbing premonitions that she will die during childbirth. Obsessed with trying to prevent this, and also acting out his loyalty to the Republic, Anakin becomes seduced by the dark side of the Force and becomes an enemy of every Jedi.With the Republic slowly becoming an Empire and the Dark Lords of the Sith seeking to wipe out the Separatists and Jedi to cover up their manipulations, the last remaining Jedi seek to halt the destruction of everything they hold dear.'Revenge of the Sith' cranks up the emotional voltage that was lacking in the two previous installments. Writer-director George Lucas brings back the adventure, escapism and high ideals that were so important to the original trilogy. He wraps the prequel story up nicely, and now the whole dynamic of the Episodes IV-VI has been changed forever. We finally understand so much more about the history of Skywalker and Obi-Wan.The special effects are all top notch, with space battles, highly detailed alien worlds and epic lightsaber duels. David Tattersall's cinematography is gripping and beautiful at the same time. The gradual seduction of Anakin and his subsequent transformation into Darth Vader are both striking and tragic at the same time, and the smashed hope for balance of the Force leaves everyone involved irreparably altered. When Vader finally appears in his traditional outfit, the reaction is not that of subtle dread, but instead a sad, heartrending sigh at the twisting of good into evil. With it, James Earl Jones' voice brings an unexpected tinge of heartbreaking emotion. This is Lucas at his finest.The film is not without its flaws, however. The romance between Anakin and Padm√© still seems stilted and forced, and neither Christensen nor Portman deliver their lines with very much conviction. Lucas is so concerned with telling the story of the fall of the Republic that he puts these two characters on autopilot for most of the film. It's really the relationship between Anakin and the Jedi council, particularly Kenobi that drives this film. Christensen and Portman, however, have both grown comfortably into their characters, so the audience accepts their actions perhaps more than the screenplay deserves.McGregor remains serviceable but not overly enthusiastic as Obi-Wan, with a few hints of the sage he will be for Luke Skywalker in the next chapter. Frank Oz still gives Yoda a sad but optimistic wisdom, and McDiarmid brings a lively performance to the table as Darth Sidious.'Revenge of the Sith' is also a surprisingly nuanced film, with a special nod to moral ambiguity on the part of the Jedi Council. In this film, more than the previous two, we learn that the sad fate of the Jedi may indeed have been equally due to their own attempts to control power as it was the Dark Lords attempts to destroy them. By seeking to deny passions and emotion, they created the perfect atmosphere of restraint to force Anakin to seek other venues for relieving his grief.'Revenge of the Sith' is the darkest 'Star Wars' film since 'The Empire Strikes Back,' and like that film ends on a down note but with an inkling of hope. Perhaps the greatest tragedy of the film is that Anakin and Padm√©'s selfishness and arrogance led to the destruction of the Republic, and that their sins would be visited on the heads of their children. And while 'Return of the Jedi' shows that Anakin indeed would be the one who restored balance to Force, it would be Luke and Leia who are responsible for keeping the peace. This is one saga that has earned its place in history, and this final film rightly sets into motion the events of the original trilogy. As Darth Vader once said, 'The circle is now complete.'9 out of 10 stars. Despite a few flaws, this is the best 'Star Wars' film since 'Return of the Jedi,' not quite up to par with the original trilogy but pretty darn close.",9,1,3,26 May 2005
Ray," Great performances and music squandered in mediocre story
","At its heart, 'Ray' is a great story stuck in a mediocre film. There is undeniable power on screen, and an interesting tale of personal struggle and worldwide triumph resonating in every frame, but the film is so jumpy and driven by set pieces that it unfortunately never comes together in the end.Ray Charles Robinson (Jamie Foxx) has a lot going against him when he first arrives in Seattle to play at a seedy dive in the late 1940s. A blind, black piano player from Florida, he encounters adversity wherever he goes. His manager shortchanges him, other people refuse to hang out with him because of his handicap, and he has to constantly be aware of his surroundings.But his music grabs people. He feels the beat every time he sits at the piano, and the house always comes alive, no matter what the size of the venue. Working his way out of juke joints and onto a tour, Ray is advised to drop his last name and just go by Ray Charles, and soon his star rises. But he isn't happy.Haunted by the memories of watching his younger brother drown when he was still a child, he soon turns to drugs to escape his feelings of guilt. Discovered by Atlantic Records producers Ahmet Ertegun (Curtis Armstrong) and Jerry Wexler (Richard Schiff), Charles soon is given the freedom to write his own music and a phenomenon is born. Mixing Gospel style (but not the Gospel attitude he jokes) with R&B, his place in history is soon set.Along the way, he marries Houston singer Della Beatrice Howard (Kerry Washington) who catches his fancy. But she alone can't satisfy him. Time away on the road and the temptations of showbiz overwhelm Charles, and he's soon keeping a lover in tow. Back up singer Margie Hendricks (Regina King) plays his most troublesome other woman, putting up a fa√ßade of business only while singing to hits like 'Hit the Road, Jack' but trying to manipulate him behind the scenes.We get the sense in 'Ray' that Charles was a talented performer who was hampered by his own feelings of inadequacy, and the film is wise to show the quieter, more reflective moments of his life. But we mostly discover that his take no prisoners style of business and recording practices was a direct result of his mother, who taught him from an early age never to let his disability to him into a cripple.Foxx doesn't just play Charles; he embodies the man in every way. He brings the musician to life in a way that is neither synthetic nor a caricature. Charles lives on screen through Foxx, who has made quite a transition from goofy skits on 'In Living Color' to a powerful dramatic actor over the course of the last few years.Other performances range from mediocre to adequate, but King manages to bring life into her role. She's not unsympathetic as the woman who wants to be more than Charles' sex interest when he's away from home. And as Charles' first producers, Armstrong and Schiff manage to make a slight impression, although their roles in the film are rarely more than just ancillary and then forgotten once Charles moves on to bigger fish.But 'Ray' never quite captures the right tone. It wants to be all things; a music biopic, a study of struggle and a life affirming treatise, and does all of them half-hearted. We never learn of Charles' first wife Elieen, and his frequent acts of adultery are just simplified into two women. The music is the movie's real saving grace, but that probably owes more to the myth of Charles then the testament to him here. What remains is a fascinating but flawed look at a man who himself was fascinating but flawed, and stands as a nice elegy to the life of the late, great performer.6 out of 10 stars. The actors and music make it worth watching, but the story's so jumpy it feel like a rhapsody, not a melody.",6,63,125,2 December 2004
The Cannonball Run," All-star madcap race to California
","This film is best summarized as a live action version of Wacky Races.  Burt Reynolds leads on all star cast of freaky drivers competing in a no-holds-barred race competition called the Cannonball Run.  The standouts in this film are Roger Moore who seems to enjoy spoofing his own James Bond character, Jackie Chan as a kung-fu foreign race champ, Jack Elam as the twisted doctor riding along in Burt's ambulance, and Jamie Farr as a mad sheik trying to show Islamic superiority by defeating his opponents.This is not a movie to be taken seriously, especially with Dean Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. cruising around dressed up like priests.  There are a lot of good stunts and chase scenes in this movie, as well as a long brawl towards the end with all the Cannonballers against a gang of bikers, led by Peter Fonda!To quote the Brain Gremlin from Gremlins 2:  'Check it out one time, won't you!'  You won't be disappointed.",8,15,19,2 September 2000
Blade Runner," Better then any anime movie.
","Everyone I know always brags about how Japanimation movies like 'Akira' and 'Ghost in the Shell' are so good.  I even heard a television commercial claim 'Akira' makes 'Blade Runner' look like Barney.What kind of crap is that?  Unlike anime, BR shows the foolishness of unnecessary violence rather then exploit it.  The story, which deals with Deckard (Harrison Ford), the special futuristic bounty hunter hired to track down a group of escaped androids is the perfect example of a look at humanity.  The androids are made out to be evil, but in reality it's their creator Tyrell who truly is the wicked one.This story is excellent, the androids are all sympathetic (remember, the crime they commit is wanting to be more human), and you will feel heartbroken at the end of the movie when you hear Deckard's mental soliloquy concerning the fate of Batty, the lead android.  Ridley Scott really outdid himself with this picture, which is one of my favorite sci-fi flicks along with They Live.It is a shame that in today's society trashy animated films which rely totally on gore and sex to entertain rather then actual human development are so popular, while films such as this are left to neglect simply because people view it as something Harrison Ford did to kill time between 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Return of the Jedi'.If you have not seen it, then watch this movie at once.  I recommend the American version, because the European unrated version's ending is too happy to remain consistent with the dark and gloomy setting of the rest of the picture.",9,0,0,26 May 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An outstanding ending to one of the greatest epic stories of our time
","Epic is just one way to describe the closing chapter in 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy. Larger then life heroics, codes of honor among friends and grand scale battles have all shared screen time equally throughout the series, and the final vignette brings the story to an end marvelously.'The Return of the King' opens darkly, with the Ring fellowship still split up and facing seemingly insurmountable odds. Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) and Sam Gamgee (Sean Astin) are still being led through the wasteland of Mordor by the treacherous Gollum (voice of Andy Serkis). Gollum seeks to stop the two Hobbits from destroying the Ring in the fires of Mt. Doom, and tries to drive a wedge between the two before betraying Frodo to his doom.Meanwhile, reserved elf archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom), cocky dwarf brawler Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) and future human king Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) have barely had time to recover from the Battle of Helms Deep before learning of another enemy offensive targeting the human city of Minas Tirith in Gondor.The wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) seeks to bring a truce between the warring human factions in Gondor and Rohan to unite the armies for a massive counterattack, while the evil demon Sauron plots to overrun his enemies with his army of Orcs and Uruk-hai and regain his Ring of Power from Frodo so that he may rule all of Middle Earth.Okay, those last three paragraphs may seem really confusing if you haven't seen the first two movies, but at this point if you're not familiar with the trilogy then you must have been living under a rock for the last three years.'The Return of the King' finishes the series admirably, bringing a powerful ending to one of the greatest motion pictures series. Where 'The Matrix' trilogy started strong but slowly regressed into an overblown mess, 'The Lord of the Rings' began on top and only went up from there.Director Peter Jackson's realization of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic fantasy story is wonderful. The movies succeed because of the mix of cutting edge special effects, powerful performances and most of all, a respect for the source material. Jackson has already earned his place in cinematic history with the ultra-gory zombie flick 'Dead Alive,' but these films will make him one of the immortals.Wood manages to move Frodo further along on his quest with control over his character well beyond his years. Frodo, the ring bearer, literally carries the weight of the world with him as the forces of darkness seek to destroy him and his friends. The emotional power is carried by Wood admirably.McKellen is perhaps filmdom's best wizard, with Gandalf perpetually in conflict with his surroundings and even his acquaintances. It is to the movie's credit that Gandalf is no longer merely a detached figurehead but a full-blown warrior this time around, and McKellen is such a master of his craft here that it's hard to believe that the white wizard is a fictional character.The rest of the cast is awesome as well. Bloom and Rhys-Davies have successfully moved Legolas and Gimli from rivals that barely tolerated each other's presence to friends who facetiously compete in battle over who can kill the most Orcs. Mortensen brings a quiet fury to his role, balancing a star-crossed love with elf princess Arwen (Liv Tyler) and his duty to reunite the many human clans under one king.This whole enterprise might have collapsed under its own weight had it been done in a campy or half-hearted way, but 'The Return of the King' ends the series brilliantly. The siege of Minas Tirith is one of the most impressive battle sequences ever committed to celluloid, even making the last film's Battle of Helms Deep seem tame by comparison. The action scenes here are underscored with flawless emotional energy, as the heroes fight valiantly against the depraved, overwhelming forces of evil.Whether against the monstrous spider Shelob, the heartless Nazgul king Gothmog, the tragically flawed Gollum, or the armies of the evil Sauron himself, the heroes battle with vigor and determination. Every arrow fired or slash of a sword is felt with force and importance almost unparalleled on the big screen.In a way, I'm sad to see the series end. Moviegoers have gotten to know the heroes and villains well, and it almost seems wrong to end the travels of the fellowship. But the story ends respectfully with all loose ends handled commendably, which is more than any other movie series has done since the original 'Star Wars' trilogy.The epilogue last perhaps five minutes longer then it needs to, but that is a personal complaint, and one with which Tolkien fans will have no problem. Cinematic history was created with this series, and 'The Return of the King' will rightly go down as one of the greatest endings to one of the greatest stories ever brought to the screen.10 out of 10 stars. Even a few false endings can not dull this unequaled masterpiece.",10,0,1,29 March 2004
Sin City," A fun ride down a twisted highway, with good actors in a disturbing B-movie
","'Sin City' is one of the more accurately named motion pictures to come out quite some time. There's hardly a moment on screen that isn't drenched in depravity, sleazy filth and urban Gothic horror. It walks a thin line between art and cine-trash, and sometimes it gleefully drops into the abyss.The story follows three down-on-their-luck individuals who inhabit the fiction Basin City, a town that has been digitally created to invoke film noir at its most intense. The first section follows Marv (Mickey Rourke) is a Frankenstein of a man, deformed in the face but built like a Tiger tank. He just had his first enjoyable night with a woman in a long time only to wake up to find her dead and himself being blamed for the crime.Driven more by a twisted form of obligation to the beautiful Goldie then a sense of self-preservation, Marv goes on a killing spree across Sin City, hoping to uncover who was behind the murder. In another story, Dwight (Clive Owen) is creep with a sense of honor when it comes to protecting women, and roughs up on a punk named Jackie Boy (Benicio Del Toro) who's an ex-boyfriend of his current squeeze Shellie (Brittany Murphy). Their encounter leads to a confrontation that might end up shattering a truce between the police and a cadre of machine-gun toting hookers. Don't ask.The final story centers on police detective named Hartigan (Bruce Willis) who stumbles on a child molester who just so happens to be the son of a U.S. Senator. Jr. (Nick Stahl) is left shot up by Hartigan, who is forced to take the rap in exchange for protecting the life of the girl who was to be Jr's latest victim. When Hartigan finally leaves prison, he goes searching for the girl, Nancy Callahan (Jessica Alba), who has now grown up into an exotic dancer. Hartigan is left trying to protect a girl he doesn't completely know anymore from a mysterious killer known as the Yellow Bastard.'Sin City' is a grotesque nightmare brought to life. It plays like 'Dick Tracy' written for 'The Crow' crowd. If Ralph Bakshi ever directed a live action movie, it would probably be something like this. Legendary comic book creator Frank Miller's graphic novels are brought to life in a world filled with dank back alleys and grisly executions.What is really shocking about the film is the level of violence. Throughout the course of its run, there are be-headings, hacked off limbs, brutal gunshot wounds and people beaten within an inch of their life. There's even one scene where a man loses something near and dear to him that I'd rather not mention in a polite publication. Nothing is left to the imagination. It's all here, and it's a wonder this film was able to squeak by without an NC-17 rating.Director Robert Rodriguez creates a believable noir world thanks to and mostly black and white photography with a few splotches of color and green screen technology. He employs it here much better than it was used in last year's 'Sky Captain in the World of Tomorrow,' but for much sinister purposes. This is a sick exercise in the surreal, and many people won't be able to stomach it. There's stuff here that puts the gore in 'RoboCop' to shame.The acting is above reproach, especially Rourke and Willis who really get into their characters. Elijah Wood shows up as a nearly feral cannibal in a performance that is light-years away from his work in 'The Lord of the Rings.' Rosario Dawson is intense as Gail, the lead gun-toting prostitute heading up O-Town. Owens and Del Toro are coiled balls of ferocity ready to explode. Everyone gets into their characters, and you forget you watching actors on screen.'Sin City' is destined to be a cult classic, maybe even a box office hit. But each image reeks of human depravity and punishment that it become an endurance test to sit through it all. Fans of Miller's comics should get what they want, but for others, this is a relentless ride down a highway of debauchery that many will wish to exit at the first off ramp.8 out of 10 stars. It's a visually astonishing motion picture filled with great actors, but you may want to bring a barf bag with you when you watch it.",8,1,2,13 April 2005
Shark Tale," Lifeless product of Hollywood groupthink, devoid of even the slightest inspiration
","Had 'Shark Tale' had even an iota of the wit and charm that seems to have little trouble finding its way into Pixar's creations, the movie might have been more enjoyable. At the least the filmmakers could have snuck in some funny social commentary through the veil of animation.What we have instead is an urban, glib, lifeless product that is market-tested and ready for consumption. An empty ghetto-fabulous morality tale loaded with pop culture references and plenty of bling-bling but no heart.Under the ocean, Oscar (voice of Will Smith) is a tongue-scrubber at a 'whale-wash' and part-time hustler. He wishes for a better life, hoping to swim his way to the top of the fish social ladder, though his coworker Angie (voice of Renee Zellweger) thinks he should be happy with who he is, and tries to subtly drop hints that she's quite taken with him.Meanwhile, great white shark and local crime boss Don Lino (voice of Robert De Niro) is planning to turn his family business over to his two sons, Frankie and Lenny. But Lenny (voice of Jack Black) is harboring some serious issues concerning eating other fish, and the godfather is worried his weak son with reflect poorly on him.Oscar has problems. In debt to his boss Sykes (voice of Martin Scorsese), he soon ends up in hot water. However, fate runs him smack into Frankie and Lenny. During the scuffle, an anchor accidentally kills Frankie and Oscar is mistakenly given credit for the kill. Now a media celebrity for being a 'shark slayer,' Oscar rides his status all the way to the top, with Sykes managing his interests and the sharks fuming that their top spot in the food chain is quickly losing its power.Situations soon escalate and Oscar and Lenny reach an agreement: if they fake a battle and Oscar emerges triumphant, he can keep his credibility as a shark slayer and Lenny can start a new life.'Shark Tale' openly references 'The Godfather' and 'Jaws' at every opportunity, which in and of itself isn't too bad except that so little is made of the main plot itself that the whole move feels like a patchwork of other, better movies, just with a meaningless hip-hop attitude. The special effects are up to par but there's nothing really special about them. The audience needs a story and characters, not just choreographed dance sequences and goofy product placements.All this might have been negligible had the movie actually been funny. This, sadly, is not the case. I only recorded one good laugh during the screening I attended, and that involved a shark voiced by Peter Falk whose flatulence had the expected effect on a henchmen. When a fart joke is the best you have to offer, then you've got serious problems.The story also steals shamelessly from the 1942 Disney cartoon 'The Reluctant Dragon,' which featured a fixed battle between a loudmouth braggart knight and a pacifist dragon to keep the locals off both their backs. That story was at least short and cute, neither of which can be said about this debacle.Along with the plot, voice acting is pretty lifeless as well. Smith gets to indulge his ego, playing his own persona on screen once again, this time in fish form. De Niro and Scorsese seem to be having fun spoofing their own tough guy roles, but that's about it from them. The biggest surprise is how much of a laid-back performance Black gives. His trademark manic desperation is nowhere to be seen, playing instead a shockingly normal character. Had he cut loose, the scenes he's in might have been more enjoyable. What's stranger is his hiding of his vegetarian leanings from his dad is handled like an allegory for a gay person coming out to his parents.When is Hollywood going to realize it doesn't matter how many famous actors you get to do voices for your characters; if the story sucks, then no amount of acting talent is going to save it? There are three Academy Award winners in this cast, just don't use that as a benchmark for excellence.This all amounts to another animated project from DreamWorks high on energy and low on inspiration. After 'Spirit: Stallion of the Cimmarron,' 'Road to El Dorado' and 'Sinbad' all tanked, it's clear that the 'Shrek' series is the only good thing the studio has going for it right now.Of course, there's no escaping comparison to that other computer animated fish movie, either, and that's when this film looks most wanting. Where Pixar's 'Finding Nemo' swam the full depths of the ocean, 'Shark Tale' seems content to just tread water in the wading pool.4 out of 10 stars. Pretty to look at, but any movie that tries to push this much 'coolness' down your throat is just asking to be despised.",4,118,204,2 December 2004
