Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," This is where a great film series starts to go bad.
","I found this movie to be visually exciting but that's all. It's full of annoying characters (Jar Jar Binks? Really?), bad acting (they could have searched a bit harder for the role of Anakin Skywalker. Jake Lloyd is cute, but he really can't act.) And I think that the script was just phoned in so that George Lucas could just feed it in to a computer and hope for the best. Thank God that Disney took over the franchise and beefed it up!",5,1,4,6 October 2018
Hereditary," There's nothing sublime in this horror.
","This intense and compelling horror film has it all as it follows the ultimate dysfunctional families descent into madness. Supernatural mind games, extreme and bloody horror, ghosts and things that go bump in the night. It also highlights some powerhouse performances, especially Toni Collette, who's a real stand out as the terrified, put-upon mom. The direction is skilled and competent, with great use of camera and lighting that helps propel the story forward. The script goes a little over the top as it creeps up on its Rosemary's Baby style ending. Overall, I found the whole film highly entertaining.",9,2,3,20 February 2019
This Is the End," Unlike a lot people, I think this is very funny.
","All this great, comedic talent poking fun at each other and them selves. I've seen it several times and it always makes me smile and chuckle.",7,1,1,26 October 2018
The Impossible," Make sure you have a large box of tissues close by when you watch this.
","Probably one of the most harrowing films I've ever seen. It has a brilliant cast who give totally believable performances in this heart wrenching and harrowing film experience that's perfectly directed and visually astounding. A brilliant film that I don't remember getting much coverage when it was first released except for Naomi Watts' multiple award nominations for her fantastic work. Tom Holland is also very good in one of his first major film roles. It's currently available on Netflix here in Canada, and should be added to everyone's watch list.",8,0,2,11 September 2018
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," Wild and crazy super sized version of the TV show.
","Very funny and raunchy movie wherein the US goes to war against Canada because of the foulmothed antÃ­cs of the infamous duo of Terrance and Philip. Lots of crazy satire and spoofy musical numbers. One of the songs, Blame Canada, was even nominated for an Oscar! If you're a fan of the TV show, you'll love this movie.",8,0,0,29 July 2018
Aquaman," Ho hum.
","This film is highlighted by spectacular visual effects and production design but, unfortunately starts to look and feel like almost every other big budget super hero film to come down the track in the past 10 years. The battle scenes are redundant, and everyone just looks so shiny and bright. The script is overwrought with melodrama and lame humour and the acting is just okay. I never cared for Aquaman in comic book form, and this movie doesn't really make me feel that much better about the character.",5,1,2,11 August 2019
Deadpool 2," Not as good as the first one, but still entertaining.
","Deadpool 2 isn't as good as the first one, but it still has it's fair share of foul language, extreme violence and a couple of cool cameos of big name stars. It also has an extensive action set piece that was partly shot across the street from my home, so that was interesting to see (four days of shooting for 30 seconds of screen time). The writing becomes fairly overwrought and schmaltzy towards the end, but you have to watch through the end credits to see some fairly good gags wherein Ryan Reynolds make some fun of his career choices.",8,1,3,22 August 2018
Molly's Game," Much more entertaining than I expected.
","Fantastic performance from Jessica Chastain and a brilliant, slick, rapid fire script by famed scribe Aaron Sorkin are some of the many highlights of this very well directed film. The supporting players are also very good. I liked it alot.",8,5,9,30 September 2018
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Fun stuff
",Tom Holland brings a boyish charm which can only be described as a cute version of Spider-Man.,8,2,4,11 March 2018
Life of Pi," Brilliant
",One of the great cinematic experiences in modern film. Ang Lee's direction is impeccable and it's a visual feast. Love this movie! ðŸ˜‚,9,0,0,15 March 2019
"Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri"," Fantastic!
","One of the best movies I've seen in the last couple of years. All the parts add up to perfection...the acting, the writing, the direction, the cinematography, the music...this is THE best picture of the year. A joy to watch.",10,0,3,16 September 2018
Nightcrawler," How did I miss this one!?
","What makes this film a true standout is the amazing performance of Jake Gyllenhaal. He's both likeable and creepy in the role of Louis Bloom and Rene Russo and Riz Ahmed are also very good The film looks fantastic, shot in a slick style that reminded me of Drive. The direction is dead on and the script is fresh and new. I really liked it.",9,0,0,23 August 2018
Bohemian Rhapsody," This movie made me cry...
","I had the pleasure of seeing Queen live when I was a teenager in the late 70s here in Vancouver. I was a big fan, as were most of my friends. I still know the words to the songs and I think I practically wore out my vinyl copy of Night at the Opera from playing it so much. I'm pretty sure I drove my parents crazy playing Bohemian Rhapsody, which I sang along to at the top of my voice while locked away in my room. Ah, good times!While I was watching this movie, I was worried that I was going to be disappointed and that this was going to be nothing more than a high class MOW. But, thanks to the absolutely amazing performance of Rami Malek as Freddie Mercury, a terrific supporting cast and some crisp dialogue and really great film and sound editing, the movie turned itself around, and by the time we reached the impeccable recreation on the Live Aid concert at the end, I was in tears, a very, very rare thing for me.Although I don't think it will the best picture Oscar (that will go to Roma), I'm sure that Malek will take home best actor honours.",9,1,2,24 February 2019
Bird Box," At times creepy and scary, but...
","The highlight of this film is the fantastic acting, especially Sandra Bullock. I think that she may be one of the most versatile actresses going these days. The movie has some very scary, creepy and intense moments but sort of falls apart with sentimentality at the end. It's not a family film, in fact it's fairly violent at times, but I still found it entertaining. The direction is at times pedestrian, but it has some great cinematography and sound.",8,1,4,29 December 2018
The Favourite," Sumptuous adaptation.
","This is a beautiful looking film, with amazing production design and fantastic direction, not to mention the brilliant Oscar winning performance of Olivia Coleman., who portrays sad and tough times of the barren Queen wonderfully. She plays the woman with just the right amount of insanity.Rachel Weitz and Emma Stone are also very good in the villainous roles of the Queens right hand women. It's hard to say which is actually the nastiest.Very good film that takes some time to get rolling along, but once it gets into the 2nd act, it really is interesting..",8,2,4,8 September 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," Eye popping spectacle.
","Amazing movie making experience tying together all all of the various Avenger themed films into one, huge super hero adventure. It was kind of fun remembering which character was with which. The film is long, with some of the expostional dialogue dragging down the spectacular set pieces, but I still enjoyed it and the script has plenty of humour. In my mind Marvel still out weighs DC when it come to character development and story telling",9,0,0,27 December 2018
A Quiet Place," Not bad
","Effective little creature feature that builds its tension through silence. Great acting, some cool creature effects and some great use of sound and cinematography all wrapped up to produce a good feature from first time mainstream producer/director John Krasinski.",8,0,1,7 January 2019
Call Me by Your Name," Not completely satisfying.
","Although the cast gives brave, strong performances and the film is beautifully shot, it does have a sense of pacing that that's a little languid for my taste. It has a very strong sense of European romance, that works well at the end, but seems to draw the 2nd act on for ever. It was a bit disappointing.",6,3,7,23 July 2018
Ex Machina," Great movie.
","This film is complex, compelling and very cerebral, highlighted by great performances, terrific production design and eye popping visual and makeup effects. A really great science fiction experience.",8,0,2,4 January 2019
Transformers," I liked it.
","I remeber going to see this the first weekend it was released. I lined up with all the nerds, geeks and kids by myself. None of my friends wanted to go. I had a great time, and really enjoyed all the eye popping special effects crazy scenes of action and wacky humor. It introduced me to Shia LaBoufe and Megan Fox. I was really drawn in by the whole spectacle. Unfortunately, it was hugely successful, and spawned a whole glut of sequels, each worse than the rest, but this one still stands out to me...great fun.",8,1,1,6 August 2018
Big Hero 6," Entertaining
",Big Hero 6 is a highly entertaining film and another notch in the Disney/Pixar belt Great voice talents and a heart warming story. Lots of fun!,9,1,2,22 July 2018
The Shape of Water," Nostalgic fantasy sci-fi romance, but did it deserve its Oscar?
","Del Toro is one of my favorite directors and his 'Pans Labyrinth' is one of the best fantasy dramas I've ever seen, so I was very pleased with how well The Shape of Water did on the awards circuit. It's a beautiful movie with great acting, and wonderful production design. That along with Del Toros' deft direction and a script that blends the romance of the story along with the sorrow of real life makes for a compelling watching experience. Did it deserve its Best Picture Oscar? I don't think so. When it's compared too some of its competition, I think that 'Three Billboards...' was the best picture of the year as it had more of a socio-political punch. Still, The Shape of Water ranked an easy second, in my humble opinion",8,2,5,9 September 2018
Marriage Story," Wow! Now I know why I don't want to get married!
","Extremely well acted and directed with an intese style of reality. I also liked the writing, which has an interesting mix of humor and tragedy. Unfortunately, I found the pacing to be at times slow and drawn out which brings out a tinge of boredom.",8,4,6,14 December 2019
Black Panther," Entertaining...but it seemed really long.
","This film has beautiful production design and decent CGI and visuals and its stellar cast does an adequate job. Unfortunately the script is overwrought and some of the scenes play out forever although there are some decent action set pieces. Seemed somewhat overreaching to me, and played out like an average MCU superhero film. I think that politics played a role in the success of this film.",7,0,2,8 September 2018
The Greatest Showman," Modern musicals may flourish...
","There are several highlights to this lavish period piece. Strong acting, beautiful costume and production design, great cinematography and a lovely original score. It's told in a unique style, with a classical look and contemporary musical staging. I was pleasantly pleased with how much I actually liked it.",7,2,4,2 September 2018
Live Free or Die Hard," Great action film fun.
","Of all the Die hard films, I think that this is one of the best, second only to the original Die Hard. There's a great chemistry between Bruce Willis and Justin Long and Timothy Oliphant makes a fantastic pretty boy villain. The script has a great sense of humour and the spectacular action set pieces are directed with a slick edginess. It's a bit long, but the time is well filled with plenty of wild stunts. I really liked this movie.",8,1,1,3 December 2018
Incredibles 2," Disappointing sequel.
","This film has everything you'd expect from a Disney/Pixar feature. State of the art, colourful animation, great voice work and high octane action sequences, but, unfortunately it lacks heart and soul and a good sense of humour. I guess it's not always that easy to capture the spirit of an original, all though they seemed to do just fine with the Toy Story franchise.",7,2,2,19 February 2019
