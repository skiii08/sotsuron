Hereditary," Why don't people turn on lights?
","If you like Witch, you will like this one. It's slow. It's disturbing. It's a story of extremely disconnected and unsympathetic people. I now understand what people mean when they lack communication as a family. The house reflects the poor health of the family. From the outside, the house reflects a certain amount of wealth. The inside is dark and isolating and sets the whole tone. I felt the need to throw holy water at the end and watch inane cheerful comedies all night. It left a bad aftertaste.",4,1,3,27 June 2018
Knives Out," Daniel Craig's Southern accent
","I love Daniel Craig. I did not love him in this movie. As a Southerner with a thick accent, I really resent a Brit trying to use a southern accent. Another issue is a mystery without surprises. The plot was a little predictable and irritating.",5,2,5,1 December 2019
No Strings Attached," Crude ways to describe sex
","This movie has women and men describing sex in the most disgusting ways over and over again. No class. No heart. Just sad. The story had potential, but we had to be gross.",1,2,2,10 July 2019
The Favourite," Eat first
","Gross. The whole movie was repulsive. Nauseatingly so!! I have never seen so much vomit. Not funny. Oscar cringefest. The Green Book was so much better!! I was so optimistic. Great actresses and actors. If you want a female lead movie, see Annihilation. The Favorite takes a discounted version of history written by a politician that offended the queen and shows everyone at their worst.",1,12,23,10 February 2019
Macbeth," Shakespeare does not need tampering.
",Macbeth is a great play. So many great scenes were changed or omitted. Where are the supernatural events? Why did Macbeth set so many fires? Why were the prophecies not followed? Don't watch this to avoid reading the play. You will fail any test you take over Macbeth. Very little of the original play is portrayed correctly.,3,0,2,10 March 2018
