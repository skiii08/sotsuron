The Rock," Definitely, one of the greatest action movies ever made
","This in my opinion is the second best action movie ever made, number one being John Woo's 'Face/Off'. This film has everything I look for when going to the movies. It has a good story, interesting characters (excellently portrayed by Cage, Connery, and Harris), superb action sequences, and great comedy. This is textbook Bruickheimer movie, and Michael Bay's best film (and probably the only one film of his to actually get good reviews). Premise is simple a revered war hero (Harris) decides to get revenge on the US government for their poor treatment of his soldiers who died in the Gulf, by holding hostage hundreds of tourists at the legendary Alcatraz (The Rock) prison, along the VX gas rockets, that have devastating effects. FBI recruit their top chemical weapons specialist Goodsped (Cage) to help defuse the rockets. They also seek the help of Mason (Connery), a prisoned spy who knows all the government's dirty secrets. Mason is chosen because he is the only one who has escaped the rock alive, and they need him to get into the prison. A must see for all action lovers!",10,2,3,12 August 2005
War of the Worlds," Not Spielberg's best alien movie, but still good
","After watching the brilliant Minority Report, I couldn't wait to see the next collaboration by Spielberg & Cruise, hoping for an even better film. War of the Worlds is good, but nowhere near Minority Report. The premise is pretty simple, Cruise plays a divorced dad who gets his kids for a couple of days while his ex-wife visits her parents. Couldn't have picked a worse time, as this is when the martians decide to attack us and take over the world, and plumage our resources. Cruise, who is not a very responsible dad, must grow up and protect his kids while they try to make their way to Boston, to their Mother. This film is not really about aliens and their takeover, but about family. The film which is masked to really resemble the 9/11 attacks a couple years ago. This film is more about family relationships then sci-fi action pix. But the flick does contain some the greatest special effects ever witnessed on film. A must see!",8,0,1,12 August 2005
