Skyfall," Perfection
","Doesn't get much better than this, perfectly executed. Proves that you can actually have it both ways, a heartwarming story and thrilling action.What I liked most about this chapter was the fact that they went for a more vulnurable James Bond. And decided to focus on his past and few but meaningful relationships, not just gambling affiliations and one-night stands. Especially the way they explored Bond's relationship with M, which made this movie a beautiful send off to that character.As always, Judi Dench is exceptional in this movie. Javier Bardem also stole most of his scenes. Maybe they could've added more layers to his character, to understand his perspective better, but all in all this might be the closest you get to perfection with a James Bond-movie.",9,2,5,27 June 2019
Captain Marvel," Pleasant surprise
","Finally a Marvel-character that is multidimensional. I felt like they went a little deeper this time, with the development of the character, how she is controlled by her emotions and how she changes throughout the movie.I suppose some of it has got to do with the fact that it's a female superhero, and that for some reason that makes it more acceptable for a superhero to experience different shades of emotions.Also, Brie Larson is excellent in this, and should get a lot of praise for her part in making this one of the most humane instalments of the Marvel-franchise.",8,2,9,27 May 2019
Yesterday," Expected more
","The premise is actually quite fascinating, and the real reason why I decided to watch this movie. But the execution is somewhat disappointing. The supporting characters are the biggest problem for me, most of them are extremely unlikable and uninteresting, and more often than not kind of annoying. Especially Rocky and Kate McKinnon's character. The writers are obviously inspired by The Office and similar types of sarcastic humor in films and series. For me, it did not work, and it made the characters come off as mostly shallow and cynical.I also feel like the tone of the film varies quite a lot, from joyful to dark and depressing. Sometimes that can be a good thing, but I felt like this one was desperately in need of some momentum. At least I wanted it to be one of two things, either a fun kind of Bruce Almighty-comedy, or a gritty Coen Brothers-drama. It ended up being neither of those things, just sort of flat.The ending also threw me quite a bit, but I won't go into details. In short, I expected more from someone like Danny Boyle, especially when you consider the fact that he already has the greatest movie soundtrack of all time.",6,0,0,15 September 2019
Aladdin," Protagonist > Antagonist
","Better than I expected. Of course the Genie was always going to be a problem. And it's probably the main reason why this never should have been remade in the first place, but here we are, and I will attempt to judge it fairly.For me, the reason why this works better than some of the most recent Disney 'live-action' remakes, is obviously the fact that most of the main characters are human. Unlike The Lion King, which didn't stop them from making the animals more like animals, instead of humans like in the original. To the point were you are no longer able to relate to them or tell what their expressions mean.Anyway, the writers made som changes to the story in this remake, which I liked, particularily relating to Jasmine (Naomi Scott). They made the character more wholesome and a lot more relevant to what's going on. It certainly gave the actor a lot more to work with, and she really shines in this movie.The thing I was most worried about beforehand, was probably the songs, but I actually think they did a pretty good job with it. The song 'Speechless', which did a lot for both the character and Naomi Scott's voice, was a particular highlight.Lastly, there was only one thing I really did not like, and that was everything relating to Jafar. Just like Scar in the above-mentioned Lion King-remake, he is not nearly menacing enough. And it certainly didn't help that the actor looked like he had stepped right off the set of Jersey Shore.Also, the character was sort of under-developed. Of course power was always his main motivation, but they very rarily tapped into his relationships with any of the other characters, and he didn't really stay in power long enough for it to become the movie's main conflict. Aladdin and Jasmine's inner conflicts were much more interesting. The whole thing with Jafar was just sort of background noise.7/10",7,2,6,7 August 2019
