Requiem for a Dream," Very messed up but very beautiful.
","As I watched the end of the movie, I was just shocked. When people say 'boys don't cry'. I felt the exact opposite. All the pain and suffering the characters had to go through showed lots of emotions. In my opinion, the message the movie was trying to tell me was that anything can be addictive. TV, Drugs, Junk food, Internet. The movie was breathtaking and changed me in the inside. The message wasn't an anti-drug message, but more of a message to tell you everything should be used in moderation and that everything has to be balanced out or things will go whack. Whether it's TV, Substances, Food, even Working or gambling. These can be bad for you by law, health, life, etc. I would'nt recommend this, but really want to tell people about it.",10,3,6,29 May 2006
