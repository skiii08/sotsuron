The Incredible Hulk," Pathetic inane babble
","This film is the epitome of what's wrong today in Hollywood.The movie starts out great. It's different, it's interesting, it's mysterious. Then, it becomes an action film, where sensitive characterization and plot development is sacrificed for CGI action sequences. After seeing Iron Man, I thought Marvel was finally ready to put together some films made for fans of comic books and the hero genre. A tip: If you're making a movie on a hero, try to abide by the Monomyth structure. The Incredible Hulk is not a hero movie. The Femme Fatale is not a femme fatale. The road of trials is not a road of trials, it is a confused set of meaningless action scenes during which the main character undergoes zero change. The belly of the whale - normally, a part where the hero enters a strange, dark world, which represents the fact that he is lost and scared (ex: Tony Stark in the cave). He comes out reborn, and ready for his destiny. This whole thing, important in any hero myth (Batman has a bunch of them.... Achilles has one, when Priam comes to him in the night), is absent.But the worst is the 'Atonement with the Father' - 'The hero reconciles the tyrant and merciful aspects of the father-like authority figure to understand himself as well as this figure' - this is usually at the climax, when the hero wins/comes to terms with his past. This scene, in this film, was the stupidest thing I ever saw. You just want to regurgitate. It is senseless.But that's the film. Bruce Banner's actions are inexplicable. Normally, a character changes over the course of a film. This character for no reason accepts his fate over 2 seconds as Bruce Banner suddenly realizes his role in the world. For all my complaints... I realize the true problem. Bruce Banner is a horrible character. Like Peter Parker. However, Spider-man is a sentient being, and so the character develops through him. The Hulk is a wild animal, and cannot be developed. And since there is a complete disconnect between Banner and Hulk, there is no character growth.",3,3,6,27 May 2009
Star Trek," Star Trek fans should be proud
","Sure, it's different. But I thought the original cast had done great, and could not have done more. However, were we really ready for it to end? This 'reboot' gives new life to the characters we love. Gives us a new look at them. Could we really ever imagine anyone else playing Kirk? No, but Chris Pine doesn't play the old Kirk, he plays a new and different Kirk. Which do I like better? Well, I suppose I'll stick to the McGill grad, but Pine was great in his role. He played the edgier crazier Kirk to perfection. Star Trek fans should be very pleased with this film, and the actors who made it great. I thought that Karl Urban was great as Bones, and that Zoe Saldana was amazing as Uhura.The toughest sell for me was Zachary Quinto, who plays Spock. I thought he was great, but I am unused to such a young and emotional Spock. His brashness seems unfitting for the wise demeanor Nimoy always brought (and still brings in this installment). I hope that the sequel will come with a tamer Spock. So, in the end, be proud that your cherished franchise is still enjoyed by millions. Different look, different characters (personality-wise) and a different kind of film, but it is entertaining and enjoying. The new actors aren't filling shoes, they're making new ones. And boy are they sweet.",9,1,12,14 June 2009
Public Enemies," Average
","I went into this expecting an outstanding film - great cast, good look and a great character to centre on. And on these fronts, it delivered.However, there was something lacking - character development. None of the primary characters (Dillinger, Billie, Purvis) were interesting. If Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid were this one dimensional in their film, I never would have heard of it (having been born 20 years later).This film will get a lot of attention, and disappear from our minds rapidly. The characters are not endearing.The best part of the film was Johnny Depp, and his facial expressions. They told us more about Dillinger than anything else. (by the way, that's not a good thing).All of the characters are stubborn, and their internal conflicts disappear in a haze of machine gun fire. Only one conflict survives: Good guy must kill bad guy because he is bad.All I can say is that I am disappointed - another film with a lot of potential that tries to wow us with the adrenaline of the chase scene and of the gunfire.",6,0,2,2 July 2009
District 9," Not as good as it could have been
","It was entertaining. Innovative, even.However, when a filmmaker begins with a premise that just shouts out 'Allegorical telling of Apartheid', you expect him to say something. To say something about man's corruption, about man's evil.The beginning of the film is pretty good at tapping into this. However, the allegory is wholly abandoned within the first hour, and it becomes a Sci-fi flick. It's a fine film. But could have been much better. Also disappointing was the xenophobia and corruption by the native Africans. They don't pity the 'prawns', they prey on them. They become indistinguishable from the Afrikaners that created Apartheid. Which then begs the question: Why South Africa? It served no purpose, other than taking the allegory and rubbing our faces in it. If the history of South Africa taught South Africans nothing.... Well, it makes sense, because this film also teaches nothing.",7,1,4,25 August 2009
Sherlock Holmes," Great characters suffer from uninteresting plot
","I was pleasantly surprised by the performances of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law. They had great chemistry which allowed us to really grasp their characters' personalities. They squabbled in nearly every scene, and it was great every single time. But this film has an odd story, and if you've read a single Sherlock Holmes novel, you know how it's going to end. The villain is well-played, but not truly interesting from the audience's point of view. I would certainly watch this again in the future - it is fun, funny and has a wonderful balance of action, science and detective work. They have laid down a nice foundation. I hope that in the future they invest more time in the villain's character. He is one dimensional. The story, oddly enough, is too straightforward. Some more twists and turns next time!",8,1,6,28 December 2009
