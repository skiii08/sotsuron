The Rock," Lingering
","Like many adolescent males, I hurriedly saw The Rock soon after its release as soon as I could.  Like everyone else, I said it was a great movie, had lots of action, was extremely cool.  Blah blah blah.Then I saw Beverly Hills Cop and Top Gun and realized that Jerry Bruckheimer is the most overrated producer in Hollywood.  It also solidified my point that Michael Bay is both overrated and not talented.  The release of Armageddon and Pearl Harbor cemented that thought so hard in my brain that I will not be seeing another of his movies again.There are ambitious directors like Oliver Stone, Steven Spielberg, and Sam Mendez.  Then there are wannabes like Brian DePalma, Walter Hill, and Michael Bay.  If John Hughes had been able to rebound from his failure Curly Sue with something along the lines of Ferris Bueller or the Breakfast Club, he would be back on my grade-A list.With the Rock we get a by-the-numbers action effort that uses a lot of dialogue to try and get depth out of thin characters.  Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery are fun to watch, but only on surface value.  Both have done better work on better movies.  Ed Harris shows he will never lose his 'tough-guy' image, even 20 years after The Right Stuff.That brings me to the next victim, Hans Zimmer.  Poor Hans, he is forced into making typical action garbage that proves several things: 1. He is not James Horner 2. He is not John Williams-- Williams' ability to extract emotion from the audience will, probably, never be matched in our lifetime. 3. He is not Jerry Goldsmith-- Jerry has gone through every type of topic known to man and yet he is still the most underappreciated talent in Hollywood. Thankfully, Hans rebounded with Gladiator.  Proving he finally knows how to write music.  As you can guess, he didn't get the Oscar for it.The action in The Rock is all about lingering.  They linger on a crushed corpse, the linger on an impaled corpse, they linger on a 'frustrated' Ed Harris.  Action is about that, action.  It is about fluidity and motion, not sitting around while something else happens.  If they want to sit around, then that's suspense.Overall, a fair enough action effort that has no surprises or lasting appeal.  John Woo would get it right with Face/Off.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",1,6,23,21 July 2003
The Mask," Leaving the Strip
","Something like a spoiler warning...This is a milestone in Jim Carrey's career: something unique, something different.  Frequently he is given a character whether lawyer, Grinch, pet detective and required to be a total goofball as the character.  Here is not the case.  Here he is given the character and required to try and be normal (he can't, but that's the point) and then have an alter-ego where he can explode.The effects have dated somewhat in the last decade, but it's Carrey's comic timing that still make it interesting.  He's allowed to go into excess, something that few other of his films (except maybe his stint as the Riddler) permit without insulting us like 'Dumb & Dumber'.Watch Carrey acting like a cartoon, then becoming a cartoon, while completing the irony by watching the same cartoons.  That's the evolution of Jerry Lewis for you...and it's still funny.This also introduced Diaz and her formula.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",Null,0,0,10 July 2004
Vertigo," See You On the Flip Side
","I don't see this as anything amazing on Hitchcock's part.  The visual style of the film isn't anything special in today's world; especially now that visionary directors like David Fincher are rising to power.  In short, Hitchcock's work dates pretty fast, revealing what age it comes from and doesn't lead to any new inventions.--Stewart's role isn't an improvement from 'Rear Window' because he is a flat actor relying on an accent.  In 'Window', that simplicity was useful since he only had to play the role straight.  Here he needs a system of duality, which he can't portray.--The plot isn't anything new in these days.  Heck, 'Basic Instinct' deliberately annotates this movie.  Everything from the blonde is duplicated.--The pacing, compared to Hitch's other works, suffers the most.  For this reason I find 'Window' and 'Psycho' the best of his works.  Efficient editing in the 50s and 60s was still in gestation, finally perfected in the late 70s.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",Null,0,4,18 January 2004
Scarface," A different sort of DePalma movie
","There are three conflicting elements in Scarface that make it both interesting and pointless at the same time.  Conflict, both open and subdued, defines Scarface more than any other word.Brain DePalma: Before the Untouchables, I would have to say that this is his best movie.  He is not as creative visually as in other movies (Snake Eyes), but he uses the camera as an element of supporting the character rather than as a seperate character.  Notice how in so many scenes he uses subtle (slow) pans and tilts to add an addition mood to the screen.Oliver Stone:  As opposed to DePalma's subtlety, Stone's script (both an adieu to cocaine and a not-so-clever knockoff of Macbeth) is not afraid to go all the way.  So many elements here are obviously ripped by Quentin Tarantino for Pulp Fiction and (to a lesser extent) Reservoir Dogs.  Who said he was original?  Stone may not have finesse in his scripts, but he's not afraid to make declarative statements, whether they are true or not.Al Pacino:  I think Pacino spent too much time talking in a Cuban accent and not enough time developing character.  He is constantly passive until his situation explodes, then he leaps into the inferno with both feet.  To be honest, I don't think he's that good of an actor.  He and DeNiro aren't as understanding of their directors or scripts to make formidable characters.Overall, a different sort of gangster film that retreads the same ground with new takes and nothing else.  If anything else, this can be considered the 80s point that launched the 'drug empire' concept.  3 out of 5 stars.",9,0,1,3 September 2003
Scarface," Proves Stone knows how to right a kick-a script
","Scarface is probably one of the most grand-scale epics of the 80s. Few films of that decade can rank with the length, scope, and excesses of the Al Pacino/Brian DePalma work. Definitely a view of what the cocaine industry can do to people, even if it IS fiction. I still cannot see how this movie is connected with the 1932 movie of the same name aside from the 'World is Yours' ad. If anything else, see the last 15 minutes of this movie as it is Pacino action unsurpassed until Heat.  Say 'NO' to drugs.",9,0,1,21 June 2002
Alien 3," Could be worse, could be raining...
","This movie is a mixed bag.  The first two had an organized structure of building up suspense, then throwing us shocks and action.  This one takes a different route, being more a typical action movie.  Unfortunately, too much time is spent in between with the problems of 'Fury' 161 that the Xenomorph takes a backseat to the underplayed drama for the first hour.  The brooding nature of the film seems to take the attitude from the first two of 'things are only getting worse' to an extreme.  (Some Spoilers)The directing style is not as flashy as the first one, but more creative than how Cameron was in ALIENS, that's probably the best compliment I can give this movie.  However, I do have some rants:1) Why do the plots keep getting more and more ridiculous with each movie.2) The CGI Alien just isn't that effective.  It looks fake, plain and simple.  The inventiveness of the effects from the first two are glossed over so instead of goth, we get gloss.  Also the Alien POV shots just don't work that well. Call me an old-school skeptic, but I liked the puppets and suits from the first two, at least they improved on the design (somewhat) for this...3) Why did Chuck Dutton have to get killed?  I'd rather he was the only survivor because he at least had some depth to him.However, this movie could have been so much worse, but it also could have been worse.  I place no blame on David Fincher's shoulders for the results and, instead, lay it on the newcomers in the series--Vincent Ward and Larry Ferguson.  Sorry guys, but you really messed up this time.Overall, 3 out of 5.  Stick with the first two, avoid the 4th!",10,2,6,10 May 2003
Gremlins," Xenophobia
","The hidden subtext of the Gremlins being a nuisance from World War Two and now being in everything shipped into America is both a true statement of US xenophobia and typical right-wing baloney (coming from a battle-scarred WW2 vet no less).  This is most likely a Spielberg influence rubbing off into the script.Joe Dante is an underachiever.  He never has made anything better and has only made things worse for himself by repeating the formula of this movie over and over.  Character depth is nonexistant, leaving us with either stereotypes or cardboard prop-ups.  You can tell she's an evil old lady because she has wrinkles and talks in a grim voice all the time.  No Hannibal Lecter subtly here.Jerry Goldsmith does kiddy music here and, while it is different to hear him go from Patton and The Omen to this, it still leaves a nagging feeling that he'd been smoking too many joints with Danny Elfman.  The first half of the film suffers from poor editing, but the second half marginally makes up for it.Overall, required viewing for children of the 80s.  It's amazing how something so horrifically gruesome could be passed off as a PG movie back then.  Yes, I count decapitations and microwave explosions to be gruesome. You laugh, but you don't know why other than that it's different.  3 out of 5 stars.  You could do worse and see Small Soldiers.",Null,0,2,27 July 2003
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," The beginning of a legacy, but the lameness remains
","'The Phantom Menace' (a truly awful title) is supposedly the beginning of the Star Wars universe.  No offense to all you lovers of it out there, but it royally bombs in my mind.  The commericalist attitude from 'Return of the Jedi' returns, from KFC and Pepsi to any other junk you can think of. Talk about an advertising overload. The production design in this is terrible.  Rather than the supposed functionability of the original series, everything looks like a computer-generated forgery and even the costumes are outlandishly stupid. My moral, give Lucas a 10 million dollar budget again and see what he can come up with instead of an epillepsy-inducing lightshow.Even the plot suffers from patheticism.  I've encountered fourth graders that have written better short stories.  With the death of Leigh Brackett and the uninvolvement of Lawrence Kasdan, Lucas has no one with the writing load--and it shows.  Go back to Episodes 4 and 5 for the good stuff.Overall, a waste of your time because there's nothing new.   2.5 out of 5 stars",Null,2,4,29 May 2003

I fell asleep watching it the second time.  I feel asleep the tenth time!  I've heard the songs a billion times thanks to all my friends, family, and whatnot! NOTHING is going to make me wasted three hours watching it again!  Stick with The Day the Earth Stood Still and The Andromeda Strain for Wise's better craftmanship.",1,17,58,14 November 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," Grab bag of artistry and thrills
","There are some incredible moments in 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', but then there are some that make you feel cheated.(HUGE SPOILERS FROM HERE ON! SKIP TO THE END FOR FINAL ANALYSIS) Pros: John Williams' score is incredible.  No doubt it is one of the Top 10 themes of all time.Some great artistic shots: predominantly during the action scenes. Thankfully the movie begins and ends on good notes (I dig the ending with the Ark in the warehouse).Harrison Ford: Honestly, who else could have improvised like he could or done the cavalier, rugged Indy attitude as good as him.Whatever additions Lawrence Kasdan made to the script: I will be honest, Lucas, like Cameron, can't write worth his weight in sand.  This is all too heavily proved in Return of the Jedi and the new Star Wars movies.Cons: Vapid Plot.  People say if you take out the 'action' in Saving Private Ryan then you have no movie and just a bunch of talking.  Sadly, if you take out the action in Raiders, you have nothing but Ford in a tacky suit and some really bad dialogue.The Mummy Scene: Every time I see it I just wonder 'What was Spielberg thinking when he included that?'  He builds up all this promise of zombie ghouls--then Indy comes by and briskly carries Marion off like nothing had happened. What a rip off!Boring Exposition: As said, without the action, this movie would be dirt. And much of the character exposition (except for Indy explaining the Ark to the audience) fairly stinks, thankfully Spielberg throws in the action to keep us from turning this off.Overall, a rather overrated flick that is still enjoyable to varying degrees.  Your opinion will probably be different, though.  Just don't crunch the plot in your mind or you'll wind up ridiculing its stupidity. That or ghoulish ghosts will zap you with lightning... 3.5 out of 5 stars.",9,0,1,9 May 2003
Spartacus," Dead Freedoms
","Holy Schla-moly.  I can automatically understand why Kubrick disowned this project.  There is enough 'stupid moralizing' to make you gag.  I know the amount of flak I'm going to get from these reviews, but I don't care.This is your only spoiler warning...'Spartacus' probably lost its impact, even the gay subtext and blood, by the mid-80s.  By then the material was already spreading through the system.Kubrick (like Scott) never made a movie because he thought characters were interesting or because a plot sounded keen; those two elements are always the first thing that dates a film.  Heck, James Stewart movies were better structured than this.  That's first-level filmmaker work.Kubrick prefers thinking in a visual world where he can explore and shift perspectives.  Kubrick managed to do what he wanted in 'Strangelove' and '2001.'  That's when he changed from studio slave to independent thinker. Interestingly enough, this and 'Troy' suffer from the exact same problems: 44 years and some people still don't learn.The sets are as fake as 'Gladiator''s (and this really hurts after the dynamic 'Paths of Glory'), but the narrative is plain and dull.  Scott kept a similar perspective, but was not concerned with the plot.  He just wanted photography and, by golly, he got it.  It didn't matter if he made it happier and more crowd-friendly/antagonizing.Alex North is possibly the worst composer from this period.  His sonic garbage here is nothing inventive.  Hermann would do that with 'Psycho.' That got the ball rolling.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",1,17,40,19 May 2004
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," Steven Spielberg and the Quest for the Might Dollar
","When I was 7, I loved E.T. and thought it was brilliant.  As time passed, I couldn't help but see all of Spielberg's little inclusions that make this not only typical, but outstandingly mediocre.  Spielberg loves making his ideal worlds the same as John Hughes, complete with similar endings.  This defines the 80s...First off we have the white, middle-class, suburban family.  Briefly touched on in Jaws, this idea only grew with Close Encounters, 1941, and Poltergeist.  He even includes it as a subtle trait in Minority Report.  If Steven is trying to invoke fear or wonder that 'this could happen to you', he profoundly fails.  Diversity is obviously not one of his strong suits. Cameron sticks to professionals (whether soldiers, workers, colonists, but never sees them as people) and Tarantino has gangsters, therein lies the common trait of directing.The character of E.T. in itself is too innocent.  I would love to have seen what Cronenberg would have done with this story.  We get the typical Spielberg 'happy' and 'sad' moments (B-O-O-H-O-O, cry me a river) full of phony emotion that other directors have tried copying ever since.  While this is a delight for the intellectually devoid in film, I gag at it.Worse yet, we now have the 'safer' special edition loaded with a few extra seconds and altered footage (I thought Michael Moore was the only one who did that) that adds NOTHING to the story.  I am sick of it...Overall, you don't need to see this movie to understand Spielberg.  To think that Das Boot defeated it for the technical awards is a complete abomination on the Academy of Fools' part.  1 out of 5 stars.",Null,3,6,21 August 2003
Casablanca," Shadow Puppet
","Noir: the word brings movies like this to mind, but where's the depth behind the fuss?  IMDB reviewers have this in the Top 10.  I suspect this has to do with a weepy end.  So much for thinking.If I recall correctly, they tried colorizing this in the 80s and failed entirely because 'Casablanca' exists totally in Black and White.  Others that cannot be duplicated in color include 'Schindler's List', 'THEM!', 'Third Man', and 'King Kong'.  When placed in color, the tone is lost. Speaking as a photographer, I can easily say 'I love B&W'.The lighting here is dynamic, even when Bogie is his bored with himself. Morgan Freeman has borrowed a lot from Bogie.  It's those shadows that make the film more than anything else.  There is competent editing here, but that doesn't help the simple script.  Like 'Rambo', there is 'Casablanca' the movie and 'Casablanca' the phenomenon.  If you don't catch with the latter then you are stuck with the former.  If only the relationships had been less caricature, more detail, then it would be real learning material.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",5,4,11,25 January 2004
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Not thinking four-dimensionally
","Zemeckis is a tricky director.  He wants to be a comedy director, but like Donner, he tries having comedy by fusing it with other elements.In the 'Future' movies it was the sci-fi/time-travel concept (in 'Part III' he added the paper-thin western genre).  In 'Death' it was a Burton/Hitchcock idea.  With 'Gump', American history/sentimentality.  Here he tries a cartoon/noir/comedy and goofs it up.Perhaps he became too good so he went on to the weaker efforts 'Contact', 'What Lies...', and 'Cast Away'.  Why does it fail?  Maybe the first problem lies with the script, after all 'The Grinch' and 'Wild Wild West' weren't the brightest of efforts.  Arthur Schmidt knows Zemeckis, and his editing isn't bad because it knows the pace. Charles Campbell's sounds and Dean Cundey's photography are right, so what's wrong?I'd say it's the environment.  We never accept the noirish settings of Beverly Hills and toon town, so it doesn't fit our expectations.  It's a lot like Spielberg and 'Hook'.Despite these shortcomings, I find Zemeckis more interesting (and efficient) than less creative directors Chris Columbus and Ron Howard.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",7,0,0,10 January 2004
Minority Report," Eh...not all that good
","Tom Cruise will be known for his cocky, grinning characters in Mission: Impossible, A Few Good Men, and Top Gun--thus excluding him from the list of great character actors.  Steven Spielberg will be best known for his action/dramas such as Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, their venture together, 'MINORITY REPORT', comes across as nothing particularly new or fresh.  It lacks both the drama of Spielberg's 80s movies and the tension of his war and horror films. Cruise is once again Ethan Hunt evading the bad guys in an story looking like a hodgepodge of Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange, and the Matrix. The ability to sin is one of mankind's biggest question marks as to whether denying it will cause a lack of the feeling of being human. By removing it as shown in the movie, as we learned in 'Clockwork', society loses much of its power.  But the plot of the movie becomes so complicated (and complex) that it becomes--more or less--Mission: Impossible with Indiana Jones set in 2054 with an annoying blueish hue to the film.  The story was too long and had enough material in it for two movies--but I guess Spielberg doesn't want to worry about the success of MINORITY REPORT II.",6,0,0,6 July 2002
G.I. Jane," The Italian Job
","First point: this is a Disney movie so Disney ethics will prevail in the long run.  Also, Disney movies excel at making environments artificial, as what happens here.  Look at how plain Libya looks compared to Zucchabar in 'Gladiator'.Second point: this is a post-'Legend' Ridley Scott movie.  Hence this is more of an experiment than an accomplished film.  Also, Scott thinks more about the eye (particularly in rhythm with the scene) rather than the script.  This is unlike Scorcese, Spielberg, and Jackson.What makes this interesting is Scott's crew.  Marilyn Vance is one of the best costume designers in the business, a plus if you're into that sort of thing.  The photographer and composer are mindless (the latter wants to be Hans Zimmer, just listen), but more importantly, this marks the start of collaboration between Scott and Pietro Scalia.  Pietro didn't quite catch on to what Scott was trying to do here (especially compared to his work on 'JFK'), but by 'Gladiator' the two had achieved a rhythm.You can see Bruckheimerisms here that haunted Tony Scott, Ridley & Pietro learned and evaded them the next time.  This was their primer for 'Black Hawk'.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",7,0,3,19 July 2004
Training Day," Daily Routine
","This is a tired genre and the method of storytelling here (character dominated) runs from an even drier well of inspiration.This is your only spoiler warning...On the surface, you could call this a fusion of 'French Connection', 'Se7en', and any third cop movie you'd like, but there's no need for that. True, Fuqua and Fincher stemmed from the music video world, but that's where the similarities end.  Fuqua's method is more Michael Bay and John Singleton.  Fincher has promise because he knows where to channel that energy.  Oh, well, at least Spike Lee is showing change...Hawke does his 'Dead Poets' bit all over again playing a rookie--how ironic. What's really shocking here is the emphasis on Denzel.  He and Tom Hanks have so much in common that I'm not surprised that they were in 'Philadelphia' together.  Both rely on taking self-assured 'mr. right' roles.  Both have lately tried to be 'mr. deep', making some noble failures. 'Glory' marked a time when Denzel really tried.Unfortunately, this takes too many cues from the last 20 years of cop shows and two Cameron movies ('Strange Days', 'Point Break') to be anything interesting.  Rather than throwing us another 'bad cop' cliche, Fuqua should have made false leads and layered backstories to make us think more often.Then again, what do we expect from the director of 'Replacement Killers' when he's working with the writer of 'Fast and Furious'?Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",Null,2,13,7 March 2004
Monty Python's Life of Brian," Constriction
","I really don't see what all the hubbub was about when this came out. Chasing after this and branding it 'sacrilegious' and 'blasphemous' is a waste of one's time in the worst way possible (as opposed to brushing one's teeth).  There's no point in hammering something when its source material is poor to begin with.  The execution is even worse.Brain is the weakest in the Python trilogy (Holy Grail, this, Meaning of Life) because of their handling of the topic.  It is embarrassingly clunky; Mel Brooks tried a similar method when he made History of the World: Part I. The humor isn't as clever and is more disconnected than the plot of Swept Away.  It makes Holy Grail look like Dr. Strangelove.Overall, don't bother with this unless you're wondering what the rage is about.  1 out of 5.",Null,4,15,12 November 2003

","By this point in Disney's post-'Mermaid' history, they felt they had a grip on culture with their colorful-yet-pointless musicals.  Remember, it's because we accepted all this lard that we now love 'Shrek'.  If society had rejected this at its roots, our green ogre friend would never have existed (or spawned a sequel).So, once again, Disney does its usual work in the design and marketing phases and lets our minds do the rest.  Interestingly enough, this is  a bridge between Phases III and IV for the studio.  Pixar recovered from 'Bug's Life' with 'Toy Story 2' and within two yearsDisney loves itself and lovingly sticks to its prefabricated formulas. Think of it, when was the last time a Disney cartoon tried taking risks? The last one that comes to mind would have to be 'The Black Cauldron'.  Too bad that same attitude doesn't translate here, nothing remotely objectionable can be shown.  In some respects, George Lucas should be running Disney since the two of them think alike (look at the extended version of 'Jedi' and the 'Star Wars' prequels if you don't believe me).So what do we have here?  Militarism, snobby chauvinism, holier-than-thou sexism, and a frozen camera.  That's why Disney hired Jerry Goldsmith to do the music, he caught on to the 'Rambo' course this movie was taking, so he inserted some of those cues into his score.  Just listen.  The same thing happened with Klaus and Zimmer on 'Pirates', they used their 'Gladiator' work again.Look elsewhere for an interesting Disney ride, you won't find it here.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",Null,0,3,30 May 2004
Se7en," Typical. Stylized, but typical.
","I really respect David Fincher as a director.  For starters, Alien3 wasn't his fault and this film shows what his prowess can do under better circumstances.  He might be the new Kubrick, who knows?This is your only spoiler warning...What has surprised me the most about Fincher is his ability to make success out of downbeat films, just as Kubrick did.  In Alien3 it was the death of Ripley.  Here it's the final confrontation between Mills and Doe.  This tradition continues with The Game, Fight Club, and Panic Room.  In all these cases, Fincher works with typical cliched material that shows its influences all-too-well.  Only Fight Club is the most original in conception.Pitt shows his usual excess dedication into a role, Freeman's boredom makes all his roles indistinguishable.  Harrison Ford has the same problem, that's why he relies on wardrobe changes to make a different face to the audience.The whole concept of serial killers is like comedies and action movies. Always trying to hustle one more surprise on the audience.  This is better constructed than 'The Usual Suspects', more stylized than 'Silence of the Lambs', but less human.  It's the 'Hunt for Red October' of the detective genre.This would be Fincher's 'commercial' film of the three types I've listed.

Surreal fantasy is bliss in their book (and mine), but Scott still one-ups them.--Again, the rich are the targets for our protagonists.

'Se7en', 'Game', and 'Panic' are likewise interesting on different levels, but this is, hands-down, his best work.This is your only spoiler warning...This is such a detail rich experience that I don't know where to begin.  I shudder to think what Bruckheimer would've done with this material, especially if he'd given it to Michael Bay.  'Fight Club' has the sons of two of our best photographers (Cronenworth & Hall), the producer of some of DePalma's interesting material (Linson), and some of the most effectively layered writing I've ever seen.  Almost everything that could be covered IS covered with more skill than 'Beautiful Mind', 'Sixth Sense', or 'Matrix' had.I haven't seen this energetic of an opener since 'Catch-22' and, unlike 'Catch', that enthusiasm is sustained throughout.  Of course there are predictable elements like the 'circle of life', 'illusion of safety', and hyperbole sex--but that's not what held my interest.  Here we have a self-referential editing style: a method that is quick and skittish, (obviously interfered with) in a film that lambastes the technique.  I should mention the original sound design and visuals--'Blade Runner' and 'Beelejuice' with the skewed color scheme trademark of Fincher's work.  Must be Fox's way of making up for the disastrous 'Episode 1' that year.  Again, Bottin knows what Fincher wants and creates more beautiful deformities.This movie is about reality, abstractions of reality, memories, and surreality.

Akira," Animation Manipulation
","Akira wants to be smart, but, in truth, you'll find more detail and sophistication just by watching the first season to Transformers than here.The animation isn't that good...now I've said it, here comes the lynch mob. Most of it has dated with obvious clunky movements compared to The Rescuers Down Under (arguably the best traditionally animated film of the 90s) or even Bambi.  Come to think of it, anime is only a collaboration between Disney levels of detail with stories ranging from Heavy Metal to Ralph Bakshi in inspiration.  Of course, the goal of animation is to present the impossible by creating a universe in the mind of the artist and translating that on celluloid.For that matter, Akira is very stagnant in the visual department.  Animation has an edge in that it can explore absolutely unknown territory, but few films have actually done that.  None of Walt Disney's original work did much searching as they were focused solely on fixed artistry and construction. Only recently have animators started going around the environment to see what their world looks like.  Heavy Metal marginally did this, but I'd say Roger Rabbit helped push that idea forward.As an action movie, Akira pales next to The Killer and Die Hard because those two are a dominant benchmark for the genre.  Adrenaline requires good heroes, menacing yet credible villains and technological comprehension of some kind.  In Akira it is about faceless nobodys with toys that resemble beefed-up props from Terminator.As science fiction, Blade Runner and 2001 are more sophisticated and fluid. The dialog here, both subtitled and dubbed, is totally cornball and separated from the actual plot.  Instead of advancing the story, it divides and often contradicts our focus.  Not only is the heavy-handed message lost in the violence, but it becomes an enormous hypocrisy.  If films like this were more concerned about telling a story than blowing stuff up (or just blew stuff up and didn't try to make us think with cheap tricks) then they wouldn't be as shallow in subtexts.  Others like that include Face/Off and The Rock.Overall, if this is the best anime has to offer--doesn't look like that now with Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke getting more and more acclaim--then I'm not impressed.  Foreign film's many different tones and methods aren't too dissimilar from their American counterparts because an equal percentage of them just don't work.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,11,4 October 2003
Alien: Resurrection," Rule of Eights
","Why do we watch Alien movies?  Truth to be told, it's the production design.The Alien movies don't have an original style, but rather are amalgamations of lesser elements.  With ALIEN it was Halloween and It! Terror from Beyond Space.  ALIENS was Rambo and Ghostbusters.  ALIEN3...well, I can't really see any large elements taken into it other than Rosemary's Baby.  With our beloved 'Resurrection', Jeunet infuses too much French style reminiscent of The Fifth Element, Starship Troopers, and Species.  Of course, traces of Resurrection are evident in everything ranging from Dark City to the Matrix. Perhaps another big problem with Resurrection is that it is less functional and utilitarian like the original Trilogy and more modern, too futuristic. There is technology, but no understanding of it.  Cameron had the opposite problem in ALIENS of making an overabundance of hardware and trying to spend too much time explaining its operation.  At least he paid that much attention to detail.  Resurrection is 1/8 as powerful.Next, DO THEY CALL THAT CREATURE DESIGN?!  The first two movies were a miracle in the design phase--the second getting my favor for improving the appearance.  ALIEN3 started the overuse of CGI that plagues this movie...'Yeah, real scary.  Hit the 'delete' key and alien goes adios.' Here the creators tried inserting too much style (and slime) into the creatures that make it less animalistic and more cartoonish.  It is 1/8 as creative as the original.I'm certain Jeunet is proudest about the Queen birth scene near the end.  So much of his French style and method are visible in contrast to Cameron and Scott's darkness method.  Bright moody colors are prevalent compared to the subdued hues of the first two...Luc Besson must have noticed.  In that sense, this is 8 times brighter than the first movie.By comparison to ALIEN3, Resurrection still fails because it stays too far into familiar territory.  Perhaps Fincher knew that his style was going to be the future of the series...so he killed it then and there.  Too bad the studio didn't agree.Overall, Resurrection has cinematography power (and more gore than the Original Trilogy combined) and little else.  The characters are typical--evil scientist, obvious android, tough black guy, and stupid white male reminiscent of Hudson from the second movie--the plot is worse, and the production design falters because computers aren't as good at replicating environments like miniatures and mattes.  1.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,3,18 October 2003
12 Monkeys," The Hamster Factor
","The Concept: 'Cuckoo' meets 'Terminator' meets KubrickThis movie is incredibly frustrating.  Terry Gilliam is somewhat intelligent in his constructions--and his work is at least technically competent--but this just makes me want to pull my hair out.  Why?This is your only spoiler warning...The MPAA never understands work like this and their rating is apt proof.First of all, the good.  Pitt, Stowe, and Willis are all interesting.  The production design is above 'Grinch' yet still below 'Brazil.'  Gilliam--like Kubrick in 'Strangelove' and 'Glory'--has a good mind for his environments, he and Lynch are everything that Burton wants to be.  He frequently uses frames of architecture, films, and art to bookmark his points.  He even makes the notion that games imprison the mind.  So what's wrong?The problem is that the plot is explained too well despite a script from the writer of 'Blade Runner'.  That's my one black eye for this project, but it's a black eye that grows into an infected skull fracture.  'The Matrix' suffers from this problem, so does 'Fight Club' though 'Fight' had the advantage of not falling into a loop .So, despite this killer flaw, it is still interesting material.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",Null,1,2,9 May 2004
Mississippi Burning," 'Untouchables' meets 'Midnight Express' and 'Mockingbird'
","Some spoilers...Funny how perceptions of movies change over time.  'Alien 4' has grown on me, 'Thin Red Line' has, 'Wizards' has, even 'Pink Floyd', but this one sank upon revisiting it.Parker's stuff is technically competent, I'll grant him that, and he has a decent grip on production values--which is more than I can say for most directors--but something wrong is afoot here.  I think Parker frequents the musical genre so he can pass off his razzle-dazzle style without worrying about filmic stimulation.  As compensation, he uses symbolism-loaded 'art' images.  Watch when the Klan attacks the church, instead of Ollie Stone-style brutality, we get a 'Face/Off' music video.If you're into that sort of thing you'll love his work but I find it thuggish and sanitized (like 'Lord of the Rings').  Honestly, it's editor Gerry Hambling that's made Parker famous, nothing else.The story here is too simple, but get rather interesting when you see the Hoover-Vietnam-King connection.  Do some reading into that later. Storywise, Parker's 'Wall' is better as it mixes past/present, real/fantasy, time/space into one crazy mix.Fortunately, the acting is interesting--Parker really got an unorthodox cast.  Each actor takes two characters to make a new knockoff.  Hackman takes his Doyle from 'Connection' and uses Connery from 'Untouchables'. Dafoe does his Christ with Atticus Finch.  Dourif combines Piter deVries from 'Dune' with Barney Fife.Want some cinematic irony?  Compare this with 'Die Hard'.  Both involve terrorism, xenophobia, and some competent attempts at being cinematic with many elements (flying, explosions, height, night, claustrophobia).  Here the good white guys save the inactive Blacks from the bad white guys.  Boring. At least McTiernan made things interesting: Black cop saves white cop from Nazis.Your favorite Parker will depend on your tendencies, but if you want intelligent Klan bashing, watch 'O Brother'.",Null,5,8,7 August 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Captain of the Ship
","One name strikes contempt into this reviewers heart: Jerry BruckheimerHe is to producing what Ron Howard, Peter Weir, and Michael Bay are to directing; a loud, noisy individual with nothing useful to say.  Yet what makes this movie so interesting?  Does that question need to be answered?This is your only spoiler warning...There are two types of crew to this movie.  There's the crew that plays it straight and there's the crew that either elaborates or plays against the norm.  The directing is dull, Gore Verbinski still hasn't made any impression on me after 'Mouse Hunt', 'Mexican', and 'Ring'.  He's been getting steadily better in his final products though.  Is it accident or serendipity?  The production designer and editors join him as the clueless individuals.The ones playing against it all are the writers and photographer.  Despite the boring incident that was 'Crimson Tide' (another Bruckheimer effort), Wolski showed talent with 'Crow' and 'Dark City'.  Here he creates what 'Goonies' wanted to be.  The writers come from such notorious work as 'Aladdin', 'Godzilla', 'Small Soldiers', and 'Mask of Zorro', but this shows an actual interest in their work.  Stereotypes are played against (the blood of the virgin doesn't break the curse, Depp's mighty boat, etc.) and Depp makes it work.If Depp hadn't been on this excursion then it would have been like 'Waterworld'--nothing remarkable, quickly forgotten.  Since Depp knows this material (and is having a lolly-gagging good time with it), he puts a plethora of energy into it.  Everyone else is too busy being serious--similar to Burton's first 'Batman'.That has me interested enough to want to look into the sequel.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",Null,2,4,14 February 2004
12 Angry Men," And the verdict is...
","Sidney Lumet sits on my list of underrated directors alongside (among others) Joe Johnston and Brian DePalma.  Their talents have either been abused or misunderstood, but this is not such a case.Spoiler minefield ahead...Courtroom dramas aren't interesting genres.  Despite whatever plot twists are thrown there is always the 50/50 chance on verdict.  In that case, this is probably the most advanced in its class.So here we have Henry Fonda as the lowly juror disputing all the facts. Everyone is convinced.  Court adjourned.  This is your typical Grisham novel or TV drama.What changes it is how we are presented this information.  At this point in time, audiences were still trying to separate the 'fourth wall' of stage from the fluidity of the cinema.  'Streetcar' was noble, this is professional.Now just think.  If DePalma had done this today we would've probably entered the heads of each man and had an examination of the evidence in their imagination ala 'Mission Impossible'.  We would probably also have a detached camera from the proceedings (hence 'impersonal').Lumet obviously killed himself trying to make us latch onto the characters and think for ourselves.  This is one of few examples where the method actually works: making faces cinematic without resorting to montage.Reiner didn't learn this lesson, Parker went the other way.  Spike Lee used the heat inciter for 'Right Thing'.Final Analysis = = Learn from this.",10,0,1,7 August 2004
Beauty and the Beast," 'Mermaid' meets Gandalf with 'Revenge of the Nerds'
","This is maybe the most well-regarded of Disney's Phase III projects as I've classified them.  It's typical formula fair, so here's my reinterpretation of the events:This is your only spoiler warning...The townsfolk represent technology and knowledge.  The Beast is myth and superstition.  Having subdued the machines in his domain and made them his servants, the Beast turns on the villagers.  After being mentally conquered by the Beast, the townsfolk reject their knowledge and fall victim to the Beast's superstition control.  Thus they go off to kill their master, but fall victim to the same technology they once controlled.  Ironic?  By comparison, Bakshi was too obvious in his work.Some interesting points:There's a John Hughes undercurrent here.  The Jock is the villain.  The Beast is the Recluse.  The Nerd is the comic relief.  Belle is turning 16 years old.Of all the post-'Mermaid' work, this is probably the most colorful.  So, despite the age-old philosophy behind the character designs, there's some imagination in the art department.  The inventor is obviously a spinoff from 'Pinocchio.'  Also, the design of the Beast's castle is pretty impressive.Once again, Menken is the real driving force.  My question is 'why didn't he do 'Lion King' and why hasn't he done anything since 'Hercules'?'  As you can guess, the Oscars love him and his ilk.So you can praddle on about the 'magic' behind this product, but in the end it's still typical.  Nonetheless, Disney films can still be interesting when placed in the context of their creation.  Here society is the Beast, having long abandoned it's fascination with Disney magic.  So Disney manifests itself as Belle, a musical intellect that seduces us.  We accept it, the curse is lifted and Disney makes a ton of money marketing its 'new aesthetics'.This lasted until 'Pocahantas', where the New World was actually Pixar. That leads to Phase IV.  Sadly, Scott better understood the tone that Cocteau was trying to make with 'Legend'.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",Null,0,1,31 May 2004
The Fifth Element," Naive
","Luc Besson wrote this as a teenager, it shows.  Cameron did the same with the Abyss, Landis with American Werewolf in London.  The films all present naive concepts more in tune with style and flash rather than deeper substance.  My only real thought with The Fifth Element is: how many times did Besson watch Heavy Metal before making this?  So much material is obviously inspired from it that I just started rolling my eyes.  By the end, everything has abandoned the sci-fi genre and gone into the fantasyland that George Lucas reigns over as king...I am, of course, sarcastic in saying that.Truth to be told, neither Willis nor Jovovich are noteworthy in this film. Holm is wasted on a cracked-out priest that made me remember the glory days of Ash the android.  Oldman is an oddball this time, unlike his serious role in The Professional (Leon) and Chris Tucker is on the spot as the warp speed DJ.  Sometimes I was wondering when Denis Leary was going to come along and give the coup de-grace to the whole project with more lightning fast banter.Thankfully, Besson has Thierry Arbogast's help in creating some of the most diabolical visuals this side of Blade Runner.  Most of the CGI is too obvious and the makeup effects are terrible, not to mention the sound, but when looked upon as parody, this is a new Spaceballs.  You decide if that's good or bad.Overall, Star Wars meets Transformers meets North by Northwest meets Hard-Boiled.  You decide if it's good or not, I think it needed some enlightening ahead of time.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,2,6 September 2003
Batman Returns," Dark Meat
","Tim Burton has lost his visionary skills.  I am, of course, referring to his abysmal remake of Planet of the Apes.  At one time in his life, he was capable of making audiences sympathize with even the most grotesque creations.Batman Returns is probably his darkest, ugliest, and most gothic film. While Batman had a sense of evil (with Nicholson pulling all the stops), Returns is more a sense of despair.  There are a few comic moments thrown in, but they offset the balance and cause confusion as to what the movie is trying to be.Fortunately, the script is far superior to the original.  Instead of guessing and making things up as they go, the screenwriters actually make a coherent story that doesn't collapse under itself like the first one.  This ignores the graphic novel roots of the characters, but does create a less politically-correct view of Gotham and its inhabitants.SOME FOLLOWING SPOILERS Michael Keaton once again underplays his role.  The problem is not helped by his absence from the first half-hour.  Danny DeVito is interesting under all his makeup (kudos to Stan Winston), but his motivation was all wrong for his actions.  Michelle Pfeiffer ekes whatever she can from her paper-thin character and winds up being the most sympathetic character.  She is far superior to Kim Basinger in the original and almost ties with Nicholson as the best portrayed villain in the series.  Christopher Walken is entirely wasted on an unneeded part.  Had his role been eliminated altogether, the movie would have flowed better and some problems with the script could have been fixed in another way.  Michael Gough is brilliant as always, but this time he seemed to have more depth rather than say 'Mr. Wayne, [insert name here] called again.'Danny Elfman's score is haunting, some segments reminding me of Elmer Bernstein's work on Ghostbusters.  The conclusion has a somber note only Elfman can pull off mixed with a smidgen of John Williams.  No wonder Burton always relies on him.  While the editing is, yet again, incomplete, Burton's twist with the camera remains both engaging and stimulating.  The film might just have a purpose in its twisted soul.Overall, an interesting, near-parodizing, view of the world of Gotham.  I can't say I enjoyed it better than the first one, but it had more human elements to it.  Probably the best sleeper movie of the Christmas season. 3.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,0,27 July 2003

Why else has Disney's conventional animation studio quit?This is your only spoiler warning...The allegory here is actually hidden pretty well.  Bruce and his rehab pals are the Disney executives, marketers and accountants who determine when they are financially grounded.  They claim they are abandoning old ways for groundbreaking ones, but when the smell of successful formula comes along...you get the idea.How does this apply?  Look at the Disney 'classics'.  Disney doesn't rerelease them to the public at intervals because they want a new generation to appreciate them.  They time their rereleases for when their new ideas flop and they need fast cash.

Alexander," Conquest of Paradise
","Another mammoth epic relying on Vangelis to hold it together.Potential Spoilers ahead...Yet another epic, tackled by the most daring director yet. An epic this scale requires a visionary, not a 'people-person.'Obviously, Stone draws common traits from his id. There's his usual misogyny, some aspirations of power, serpents, and history obsession. Add some drug-induced panic. Let simmer. Pray for the best. Looks pretty silly now, didn't in 'Born on the Fourth'. I'll skip acting and story comments. If you want to know more about Alexander, read a book. Besides, I don't want a story getting in the way of the vision.The battles--especially in India--are better than what we've seen this year; more confusion than 'Troy', but without the energy that Ridley brought to 'Gladiator.' Stone's problem, once again, is not finding a distinct vision in his chaos. Before this I watched 'Spy Game' and found a continuous vision inside all the gee-whiz editing so this isn't impossible on a larger scale.Sure, we get the usual beheadings, some new (I guess trendy) cruelty to animals, parades, and grand sets. All to be quickly forgotten--only the India battle registers. The only place really left for the genre to go is the sexual dimension. Here's where Stone throws his trademark controversy engine, but his sexuality (literal and implied, hetero and not) has always been the dull sort. Maybe Ridley will get it right next time.Like 'Alexander', Stone probably outdid himself in the wrong areas.(As a side note: Vangelis gets to wrap things up nicely.)",Null,0,2,26 November 2004

He takes comfort in those self-assured roles, so we take comfort in his predictability.This is your only spoiler warning...As for 'The Natural', all I will say is that Levinson got himself in order 'Good Morning, Vietnam'.  Sport movies need to be invigorating to capture the atmosphere of the competition mixed with loads of uncertainty.  Turns out this is no better than any 'sport film' made by Disney.It prides itself on triumph, buries itself on defeat, and everything is superficial.

","Spoilers.Weir bores me.  Part of him wants to be Spielberg, another part wants to be Coppola.  So, between being torn between the entertaining and the dramatic, he fails.Williams is the focus, creating the rebel-rouser copied by Jack Black in 'School of Rock.'  If you liked 'Remember the Titans' and 'Braveheart', you'll love this.  They are shallow perceptions of disturbing themes. Mortality, humanity, family, and sex are all explored, none to the fullest.So, when we have emotion for emotion's sake, we are bored and left unresolved with questions left to be answered.  In the end, it's a 50s sitcom with the homily at the end to please everyone.  Perhaps it's from these reasons why Williams is so powerful.  I love the scene of him instructing the students to rip the pages out of their books.  It's the only impression this film left with me, tearing out pages.

Ed Wood," Burton sells his visual soul for a script
","Perhaps, since this movie, Tim Burton has realized that the macabre he creates is too playful in its intentions compared to what others have tried. Whenever he tries creating moods, whether in 'Apes, Batman 1 & 2, Beetlejuice, Mars Attacks!, or Edward Scissorhands, he is always trying to make something funny or lighthearted about his topics.  Imagine if Kubrick did the same, would he be so great?With Ed Wood, Burton tries to create a story about an unfathomable loser. Depp, one of the most diverse actors I have ever seen--no wonder Burton keeps using him, is wonderfully inspired, but it isn't him or anyone else dominant in the cast--not even Martin Landau--that is the standout.  
I am, of course, referring to Vincent D'Onofrio's fleeting moment as Orson Welles.  Had Welles himself seen it, I bet he'd have thought it was effective.  Granted, Burton strips such a vibrant character of much detail in order to make a B&W version of Robin Williams' character in Dead Poets Society.  Still, the amount of elaboration that Vincent puts into the character, even the mannerisms, make him the highlight.  He also has some great delivery with milking the audience, if they're smart enough to catch it.Burton uses his camera more like a stage appliance this time.  He probably knew that this was going to bomb upon release, but he made it anyway.  Thus he is no different than the character he is making.  The fact that Burton's movies keep winning or getting nominated for Makeup awards shows how he focuses on altering the acting element of filmmaking to create props out of people, not characters.  Best example: Beetlejuice.Overall, not as good as the IMDb rating would suggest.  I still think Batman Returns is Burton's best work.  This isn't too bad, though, for the extreme minority that it appeals to.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,0,6 September 2003
Home Alone," Humor is a poor substitute for intelligence
","First off, I would like to say that John Hughes has fallen in ability since Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  This movie is a shining example of that. My sister saw it when it was first released in 1990 and told me that 'it sucked', she was in third grade.  I didn't see it until last week and can almost agree with that, but not totally.  As far as so-called 'Holiday movies' go, Die Hard and Gremlins will remain my pop culture mainstay.Home Alone racks up plot holes faster than the Wet Bandits fall down.  They are so dumb that they make the Three Stooges look like the Untouchables.  To think that Joe Pesci belittles himself into a role like this is beyond my belief.  Being outsmarted by an eight-year-old is not the best thing to include on his film resume.  The film would have ended a good 30 minutes earlier if Kevin had acted like a normal kid and don't the smart thing instead of being a defensive snot.Chris Columbus has always had a fascination with kiddie comedies and this is not his best effort.  Thankfully he is not so much in the pursuit of money (as with Harry Potter) as he is with the pursuit of political correctness. It's not surprising that the script it Hughes' work, there are so many of his little touches throughout.If I can say one good thing about this movie, it's the music.  John Williams KNOWS how to write music and this movie is a perfect example.  The film certainly has a nice Christmas ring that contrasts with the ever cloudy skies.Overall, there are good movies for the holidays and good movies for kids. This one might fit their bill, but everyone else will find it to be a watch-checker after a while.  2 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,1,9 August 2003

","Spoilers.L.A. Confidential is one of those miraculous movies that remains strong both in the casting, writing, and staging.  Part of it plays on our desire to be voyeurs in the life of celebrities (the title stemming from a tabloid, duh) and the other half tries to translate noir into the color of today. 
It succeeds and, thankfully, doesn't try to create something like Body Double.Noir is one of the most delightful creations in the world of film because is eliminates the old theatrical sense of right/wrong and makes use of moods in ways that stage actors can't.  With noir, the camera becomes an entity unto itself and we are left thinking.  Some noir entries are cheap, mostly Sam Fuller's, but others like this are really, really good.Russell Crowe demonstrates his ability to be a dominant presence actor like Sean Connery and Kevin Costner, that's the easy part.  As time goes by, he elaborates and becomes more detail obsessed with his role.  By the end, he is the only redeeming actor.  Pearce is a prop like Costner, that is all-to-obvious.Overall, L.A.

X-Men," Panel Work
","*Sigh*  It's at times like this after two years of writing reviews that I wish I could go back and rewrite some of the old reviews just to punch them up a bit.  Oh, well, how times change...American society loves comic books or graphic novels or even just the daily strips in the newspaper.  We love the bizarre notions of reality that can be created with the pen and watercolors.  Heck, just about every culture loves them.  Names like 'Dark Horse', 'DC', and 'Marvel' are thrown around to the cult following around them.With film we have a more fluid medium.  Ang Lee had a chance with 'Hulk' since he already had made a visually sound film, but that project had mixed results.  Tim Burton had the visual look accomplished by the time he made 'Batman Returns', but then let Schumacher destroy the series.  Raimi's 'Spider-Man' lacked his usual visual flair, probably brought on by studio executives who didn't want him to expand like in 'Darkman'.  'Superman' was pure Donner, but Donner's problem was that he didn't have a model to follow other than the prior cheesy series.  Stephen Norrington is atrocious and Guillermo Del Toro is questionable at the moment (I'm waiting to see how 'Hellboy' comes out).  I won't even mention the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' or 'Men in Black'.Despite all these branches, the genre really boils down to two camps.  There is the light-hearted fare of 'Spider-Man' and 'Superman', reliant on truth, justice, blah blah blah.  Then there are the pessimist, 'dark' films. 'Blade' and 'Spawn' fall into the 'wannabe' sections of this genre.  'Batman Returns' marks the high (low?) point.It's as though the studios think they can't make a truly pessimistic 'graphic novel' and be successful.  So, as in the case of the first X-Men movie here, we get everything to us at 50% power.  More emphasis is given towards what we know of film rather than the comic books themselves.  How else do you explain the X-Men's costumes or Professor X as a weaker Dr. Treves?Perhaps one reason why so many of these latest installments don't work is that they don't create the right environment.  The Batman movies, though they boiled down to pure idiocy by the 'Robin', still created a world both detailed and ugly and reminded you that the world was real fake and not pure fake.  That's another nail against these X-Men movies.What do I consider to be the best 'comic book' movies?  Mystery Men, Darkman, Batman Returns, RoboCop, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  They annotate the genre (except Returns) with their own styles.Singer did better the second time.

A Bridge Too Far," Last of the Great War Epics (some spoilers)
","Before some liberal comes down on me saying 'since when is war ever great?' I would like to state that this is probably the last marginally-realistic 'epic' from the second generation of war movies (1941-1977) that focuses more on the event rather than the people, as is the case with these films. The vast, expansive movie covers Operation: Market-Garden closely following dozens of grunts, generals, and civilians in the midst of it.  General 'Beanhead' Montgomery was one of the biggest flaws of World War II and had he been in charge longer, the British Army probably would've ceased to exist because he would've suffered too many Pyrrhic victories.  Every time Eisenhower gave him the reigns to the war effort, he went off and crashed it leaving Patton to save the day. This is a shame because the British grunts of the war--as well put in the film--fought with great courage and skill, only to have their commanders make some of the worst decisions in military history. Heck, ALL sides are presenting as acting with great professionalism though the Germans are still shown in their stereotypical fashion of goofiness and mindlessness. While the film has too much in the pyrotechnics department and editing seems to be underdone, I find this much better than The Longest Day, The Big Red One, and Green Berets.  4/5",10,2,5,13 November 2002
The Terminator," Help saved sci-fi from Star Wars (spoilers)
","Terminator deserves an award for the impact it made to sci-fi--albeit good and bad.  Star Wars demolished the genre that Kubrick slaved to change, making space operas more important than thinking at the box office.  With Terminator we abandon droids, galactic empires, the Force, and all that other pissant elementary school dung and get down to business, pronto. Many films are hailed 'cool', but intellectuals get their brains working and reject is as garbage.  Terminator is one movie that'll please both smart & stupid, the darkness gives the sense of evil everywhere while an electronic score enhances the feeling of man at the mercy of machines.  Arnold, limited actor he is, reigns king of deadpan brutality.  When he puts a shotgun shell in someone's chest or rips their heart out--he doesn't smile, frown, or flinch, his performance is robotic--AND IT WORKS! The nightmarish future scenes make Mad Max look like Teletubbies (interesting how many set pieces were reused in T2).  While the futuristic Hunter-Killers seem fake, their machined ruthlessness causes fear. The cyborgs slay like Judas, betraying our emotions into believing only what's human, then whipping out the laser cannon and perforating us. As in almost all his work, James Cameron has women become strong.  Little is spent worrying with that and more on the story--making it one of the best low budget movies that does a lot with little.  In a 150 MILLION dollar film, do they care where the cash goes?  No, and we spectators wind up with 'Wild Wild West', 'Pearl Harbor', and 'Waterworld' (not bold moves for the studios)!  In a $6 million film like this, togetherness is key. WARNING!  DON'T CONTEMPLATE HOW TELEPORTING IN TIME TO CHANGE THE PAST IN ORDER TO SAVE THE FUTURE WORKS!!

Catch-22," 'And that has made all the difference'
","This is your only spoiler warning.Where do I begin?  Mike Nichols goes for the grandiose in ways that make other war movies inferior by a landslide.  The first 20 minutes of 'Catch-22' are so flawless that it seems a shame when the movie slides into Orwellian nihilism.  By the end, it is 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest', that is the sad part.  Better yet, the dialog is near Shakespearean in rhythm and interaction that it supersedes the monochrome characterizations. Finally, this and 'Apocalypse Now' are all you ever need to know about 'audio experience'.  Phenomenal.Directors make three movies.  The first is the experimental one that gives them notoriety.  Then there is the commercial film that garners them the financial power to make the third film--the personal one that is close to their soul.  Nichols worked in reverse order here, the 'Graduate' was his commercial film, here is his experiment--and get ready for something deeply complex yet hilarious.Immediate peers--'MASH' and 'Slaughterhouse 5'--'Catch-22' is the best. 'MASH' is sophomoric and unsophisticated.  For the sake of better contrasting, 'MASH' is 'Weird Science', '22' is 'Breakfast Club'.  Altman is not as unbound as Nichols and is too concerned about entertaining the audience at the expense of the message.  '5' is poorly constructed due to Hill's interference, a more competent director could've succeeded.General peers--the 1970 crowd--aren't as powerful either.  'Tora! Tora! Tora!' is a giant documentary.  'Kelly's Heroes' continues in the footsteps of 'MASH', rarely offering the same glimmer of creativity that '22' holds. 'Patton' is the closest to '22' because both are 'Love of Glory' movies. Yet 'Patton' is a character at war study while '22' is war itself being studied.  I already covered 'MASH'.Abstract peers--all other war movies--are mixed in their comparisons. 'Memphis Belle', 'We Were Soldiers', 'Blackhawk Down', and 'Windtalkers' are John Wayne movies--the glory and grit of battle.  'Platoon' and 'Casualties of War' are 'bleeding heart' movies that aim for the heart of the audience. 'Full Metal Jacket' and Saving Private Ryan' display war as a noisy excursion of human morals.  'The Thin Red Line' is war as an extension of nature.  'Catch-22' is unique because it appeals to the LOGIC of the viewer and certainly is the most cerebral of all I've listed.  'Apocalypse Now' and 'A Bridge Too Far' are better only because they know that everything ends on 'a whimper.'Overall, I was surprised by this movie.  Hearing Nichols' commentary on the DVD was a bonus.  If only it had kept the energy of the opening throughout the whole movie.  (75%)",10,0,3,7 December 2003

","Maybe because I grew up with a father who went to 'Nam and the Gulf. Maybe because I was worried sick both times since I thought I might never see him again.

We Were Soldiers," They Just Don't Get It
","On my initial review of this movie, I thought it was spectacular.  I withdraw that comment now.  Randall Wallace fills this movie with so much politically-correct garbage (compared to Hamburger Hill and Platoon) that I wonder what Mel Gibson was thinking when he signed on to this.As far as imitating Saving Private Ryan, WWS fails gloriously because it doesn't understand the *horror* of war.  Violence in Private Ryan is meant to be unflinching and realistic; here Wallace (and Gibson) flinch a lot. This is obvious in the full-color fighting complete with typical Hollywood setup.  There is no sense of reality, only distance.  Not even John Woo and Ridley Scott understood the concept in their movies.  Thereby, as far as the next generation of war movies is concerned, I approve of Private Ryan far more than any other.  Especially this.  The use of slow-motion and drowning out the sound for the cliche, gung-ho music was not a bright move and reduced this to an action movie...not a war movie.  Coppola and Stone understood the VietNam scenario better than anyone else.  Hence, they made better products.  While that is in the eye of the watcher, my opinion trumps all since this is my review.Overall, stick with previous war efforts for a better understanding.  This is only for die-hard Gibson fans or those who failed high school American history.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",8,1,2,21 July 2003
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Flight
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is George Roy Hill's best movie.  Here all his little touches work, except for those atrocious songs by Burt Bacharach.  That guy is overrated.By comparison to The Wild Bunch, BC&SK is an artistic flop because--once again--appeasing the audience supersedes storytelling skill.  Furthermore, Wild Bunch was a flurry of images (a record in the cutting room) while Butch and Sundance proceed on a straight course the whole time with Conrad Hall's camera zooming the whole time.  Sometimes he is more concerned about motion than composition.With Neuman and Redford in this, you know the quality is going to be on the level of, say, Independence Day.  Not once in the story do they get over the fact that all they are doing is cracking one-liners and actually get to acting.  Katharine Ross is more of a crutch to the story, I still can't figure if that's a good or bad thing.  The problem is the movie tries to make its message too obvious as opposed to not worrying about one and having it come off as subtle.  RoboCop had this problem a lot.Overall, this is good, but not great.  For a better Western, see The Wild Bunch.  For better music, try The Blues Brothers.  3 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,3,23 August 2003
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb," Ingenius
","Anyone can make parody (see Leslie Nielsen), but it takes a great deal of intelligence and wit to make a film like this.Humor: the jokes are dead on, but you might need an American History textbook with you to understand some of the humor.  Kubrick knew what he was doing and up until the mid-90s, when the next generation that never knew the perils of nuclear war started taking over, this had to be the best satire ever made.  It still is.Awards: The Academy is a bunch of nincompoops when they consistently pass over great art like this in favor of...Tom Jones and The Sound of Music? What is THAT?!Sound: in low-budget, independent works like this, sound tends to be left out and considered a minimal priority.  Not here, every click and beep of the CRM-114 is authentic-sounding and the echoes in the War Room are dead on.  Even the gunshots maintain that Looney Tunes tune to them.  All I can say is 'wow'.Cinematography: The camera is beautifully manipulated (in a rather straightforward) with no behest on Kubrick's part to keep things simple but effective.  'If it's stupid, but it works, it isn't stupid.'Acting: this film is all about over the top performances and every single act puts his ingredients into the stew.  Fortunately, unlike such efforts as Batman Returns, everyone gets a good amount of say while still being memorable. 'Hey! What about Major Kong?'Overall: As a sci-fi film, Dr. Strangelove remains one of the best in depicting human error (a concept further elaborated on in 2001) and thus retains its placing in the classics of the genre.  Sci-Fi, after all, is not about slimy ALIENS or big bug battles, but rather the effects of mankind's existence on his own psyche.  Or so I see it.A worthwhile film that has not aged as well as others.  You either will agree that it is incredible or find it loathsome, incomprehensible, and boring.  If the latter, get your head screwed on straight because XXX has decayed your brain.",10,1,1,5 May 2003
Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi," Duh...I am George Lucas, I am in control of Never Never Land
","Return of the Jedi is a serious twisting pain after the highlight, both in storytelling and power, of Empire Strikes Back.  Lucas thinks he knows so much about such topics as military tactics, politics, religion, and so on, but he is no more than a teenager with an overactive imagination.  He doesn't understand these concepts unlike more mature filmmakers like Oliver Stone and Ridley Scott.  Lucas' head is so far in Never Never Land that reality, even in his Star Wars universe, becomes something he constantly changes the rules to fit his needs.  He isn't a smart creator.  James Cameron was the same way with The Abyss, but that product was ten times better than this.  Both of them have their naive fantasy traits locked in this series, but Cameron has gone to the modified Heavy Metal routine.First of all RotJ tries to go in an Indiana Jones-style of film akin to the original Star Wars ('comic book hedonism' as Pauline Kael called it) and dumps any true emotional power for merchandising and dollar power.  How else to you explain the ewoks and plethora of new characters and hardware?Secondly, Lucas hires a sap to direct.  Obviously this was so he could keep pulling the directorial strings while remaining 'creator', 'writer', and 'producer'.  I am sorry for the production.  The visuals are uninspired and ineffective this time around and Jabba the Hutt is as threatening as colon cancer.Overall, the weakest link in the original trilogy, the ball only falls harder from here on.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,4,3 September 2003
MASH," Senses
","Robert Altman is not as clever as people would have you believe.  He is no more sophisticated than Paul Verhoeven or Robert Zemeckis.  Between MASH, the Player, Nashville, and Gosford Park he repeatedly shows in ineptness with various topics.  By comparison, Woody Allen is a genius.MASH wants to be great (the TV show was worse) but too many times it falls into the same kind of pit as Animal House.  It is less concerned about its message and more about providing some satirical gag.  While some are effective, many just don't work.  Part of the blame goes on the cast, Elliot Gould is good, but Donald Sutherland can't deliver.  Sally Kellerman seems torn between wanting to play her role straight or overreact to everything.Overall, Catch-22 knows what it is, MASH doesn't.  2 out of 5 stars.",1,11,23,21 August 2003
Alien," Give Scott a camera and here's what you get...
","Ridley Scott typically lets his visual style impede in the way of telling a story (Gladiator and Blackhawk Down in particular), but sometimes he is blessed by a tiny budget in which case he must improvise as necessary.Enter ALIEN, by all means a breakthrough movie for everyone involved and a landmark in the science fiction field.  Between this and Terminator, the genre is spared of the annihilation it would've suffered had George Lucas had his way (thankfully Lucas wisened up with Empire, only to fall on his face with Jedi).The visuals are awesome, possibly the best outside of 2001: A Space Odyssey in the Sci-Fi realm.  Of course, pure sci-fi is rarer to find than uranium in your backyard and ALIEN is yet another example of enslaving the genre to another inferior one.  In this case: horror.The cast is negligible at best, pathetic at worst.  There is no real character depth, not even for Ripley (James Cameron would get her role kicking into hyperdrive thankfully) and the plot still has its lapses in logic.  My real sympathy goes to Ian Holm, but not his character, since he seems to be the only one who can act beyond screaming like Veronica Cartwright's character and spouting 'Right' as Harry Dean Stanton does.  Ian also gets the best lines =)Actually, that can be said for the ALIEN series in a whole.  The bigger the sequel number, the more plot holes there are.  Someone want to explain how the eggs got onboard the Sulaco in '3', or cloning Ripley after 200 years in 'Resurrection'.  Exactly, point proved.The visual and special effects are a grab bag.  They are better than Moonraker, I will admit that, but some scenes are rather lackluster in the flash content.  In many cases, the Adult ALIEN looks like a guy in a suit (they perfected the design for ALIENS in my opinion) and some of the space scenes, particularly at the end, are obviously phony.The tension is much the same as in ALIENS, we get halfway into the film before things really get rolling.  Fortunately, Mr. Fincher got us going at the outset of '3', but then wrecked it by having too many pauses.All in all, ALIEN is an incredible experience that isn't quite as exciting or enjoyable as ALIENS, but still deserves much respect for the ground it covered. 4 out of 5.",Null,0,1,3 May 2003
Barry Lyndon," The Camera and the Stage
","When I was in high school, it was considered 'cool' to watch Stanley Kubrick movies as they were seen as 'more enlightened forms of entertainment' over stuff by Steven Spielberg and John Hughes.  If you didn't memorize the opening speech to Full Metal Jacket or hadn't seen Nicole Kidman in Eyes Wide Shut then you were rejected from the clique.  This was at the time when I was first viewing Kurosawa's Rashomon and Ran and accidentally came across this gem.  Sure, the rest of the gang would be quoting along with Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange, but not one of them would dare sit down and watch this or 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Fools.Barry Lyndon is another sign of sheer genius on behalf of Kubrick.  Notice that in his career he is never concerned about making money, just creating an image and telling a story.  Imagine if Michael Bay did the same, he'd be out of the business in no time and having to sell his own movies at the Video Hut.  This movie is one of his better detailed (and yet mysteriously unsung) masterpieces that is so beautiful to look at that it almost becomes artistic pornography (in the sense of creating intense emotion).  This isn't to say that Barry Lyndon is vulgar.  By comparison to Eyes Wide Shut and The Shining, this is a kid's cartoon.Kubrick is once again a certified genius with his camera.  The elaborate and glamorous scenes ranging from duels to gardens and even just the opening prologue are beautifully rendered in a style reminiscent of Monet or other artists.  I found it interesting how Kubrick includes pigeons (doves?) in the final duel.  Perhaps John Woo gained some inspiration from this.The story is paper thin compared to 2001 and lacks much of the symbolism. In fact, it is very hard to either sympathize with Ryan O'Neil as the title character because of his lack of portrayal.  As a whole, none of the characters gain either support or disapproval because of their fleeting presence.  The sets and costume designs themselves become more of a character than the actors.  Thankfully, the story is not as convoluted as I expected.  It flows nicely and never gets boring because of the variety of powerful elements infused into it.First off, kudos to both Ken Adam and Vernon Dixon for their brilliant production design.  I loved what Ken did with Dr. Strangelove (smart move for him to ditch the Bond series for that).  John Alcott is one of Kubrick's lesser cinematographers, but he is still very talented here.  I'm certain that, if he had lived longer, Kubrick would've kept using him.  He is not as concerned about symmetry, that or the topics aren't, as the rest of Kubrick's work.  The biggest irony about Barry Lyndon would have to be that everyone in the categories EXCEPT Kubrick won an Oscar for their work.  I think the Academy has something of a grudge against him because of his superior quality of work.Overall, a phenomenal quality of film that they just don't make anymore.  I put this in my Top 10 required viewings for anyone who wants to be in film. Kubrick has transcended Shakespeare with this film.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",10,111,169,14 August 2003
Full Metal Jacket," Kubrick at home, but not at his best
","Full Metal Jacket is Stanley Kubrick's way of hopping on the Hollywood bandwagon of mass-produced Vietnam movies inspired by Platoon.  While 'Platoon' went into the great ethical questions of war, 'Full Metal Jacket' aims for plain vulgarity.  Every character is a dehumanized sociopath in one form or another.  Whether this was intentional or not is unknown.Kubrick's movies tend to feature men at war.  That is one of his most common motifs, but it is rarely exploited to its fullest measure.  Here he tries too hard and the scenes in Vietnam lack the precision of his earlier work. While the film certainly is a leap compared to 'The Shining', and Kubrick tries to be inventive and different, it boils down to blowing things up and profanity.The Parris Island opening, of course, is what this movie is all about. Eremy earned every penny of his paycheck as the almost psychotic Senior Drill Instructor with plenty of 'advice' and who could pummel the tobacco juice out of you at a whim.  Thankfully, the dehumanizing point is made clear here thanks to him.  Kudos.Overall, worth a look once, but maybe not twice.  See 'Hamburger Hill' instead for a better look inside the VietNam War.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",9,0,1,19 May 2003
Empire of the Sun," The sky's the limit (some spoilers)
","Empire of the Sun is an interesting mix of Spielberg's talents.  The man is one of the most gifted storyteller's in Hollywood, but some topics are extremely difficult for him to portray.  Many of his staple 80s crew is used here from Michael Kahn to John Williams and even Allen Daviau (who creates here the best work of his career), but it is the script that suffers the most from his work.Empire of the Sun can easily be considered a more mature version of An American Tail, also Spielberg, because they rely on similar hooks and devices to carry the story and involve the audience.  I will admit that his use of the camera has gotten steadily better even though JAWS is a tough mark to beat.  The editing feels totally off and, while I would've like some more depth in some scenes, jumps too far around after trying to get us adjusted to the world we are now in.  The opening exposition, Eurocentric as it is, only paves way for an even longer first act that tries explaining too much of the world in December 1941.In another fashion, Empire of the Sun represents Spielberg's urge to create a vision that would become Schindler's List.  I am happy there is no flag-waving or jingoism on the part of Christian Bale's character.  He is one of the best child actors I have seen, even when he is responsible for carrying the entire movie on his diminutive shoulders.  John Malkovich is good, but his character's lack of dimension is the fault of the writer, not him.Overall, an interesting, albeit free-spirited, movie that might please drama buffs.  Others may be turned off by its long runtime.  After all, it's about a boy who loves flying but never gets a chance while the world collapses around him.  2.5 out of 5 stars.  Spielberg's done better.",Null,1,4,25 July 2003
Glory," Uncivilized Combat
","Mild spoilerOne thing always annoys me with war films, when the directors or producers decide to have narrations throughout to coincide with the activity onscreen. In few cases it works, Apocalypse Now being the prime example, but most of the time it doesn't--Thin Red Line in particular.  Even Charlie Sheen's philosophy chatter in Platoon was of no help to the audience.  Barry Lyndon was dependent on a narration throughout, but it supersedes being a simple war flick altogether.Glory goes in the ranks of A Bridge Too Far, Das Boot, and Saving Private Ryan that leave all assumptions up to the audience.  While Glory is effective on the acting level, it bombs technically.  The Civil War never was a good film topic to start with and this movie only solidifies my point. Gods & Generals and Gettysburg actually go so far as to try and match the actual war in runtime.  Nonetheless, I consider Glory the best Civil War film because it isn't afraid to be real in chatter.Matthew Broderick is a little off in his portrayal.  I have seen too many John Wayne movies, though, so that's the worst comment you'll get out of me. Denzel Washington is a cross Song of the South/new age character that strikes me as effective in his portrayal.  Morgan Freeman, possibly the smartest actor in the bunch, knows his role and his character's role.  He is one of the best in the business.Unfortunately, Edward Zwick isn't a bright director, either visually or narratively.  Spielberg and Cameron both hit their visual high points with films that were considered commercial and critical failures, Empire of the Sun and The Abyss, respectively.  Here isn't any different, but I honestly have to say that Cameron's Abyss was more precise in the sound and cinematography departments.  The Academy doesn't know anything about those fields, though.  Overall, the film uses the obligatory 'we are united' motif at the end to silence any further race criticism.  Had the makers decided to be a little more sophisticated in their thinking and a little less crowd-pleasing in their actions, I would've given this a better rating.  3 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,1,5 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Failure
","That one word sums up the whole movie.  We get more of the same and nothing new.  A five-year old could spot where the plot is going from an hour away. Lucas demonstrates in full glory that he is no longer the romantic warrior icon or revolutionary thinker he was when he made 'Star Wars' and 'American Graffiti'.  Now he is like Spielberg and Cameron, content only in appeasing the masses in hopes of getting a LOT of money out of it.The cast stunk.  Without Liam Neeson there is no wise guidance and Samuel L. Jackson looks like he isn't having any fun.  The worst thing, of course, is the CGI.  Lucas should've fired his production designer again because everything either looks oriental or plastic.  What a waste.  When he gets back to being the inventive self he was rather than the slave of Silicon Valley he is now, let me know.Having nothing else to rant or rave about, I condemn this and demand my money back from 20th Century Fox.

Romeo + Juliet," Almost Watchable
","Romeo+Juliet is what happens when MTV tries to liven up one of Shakespeare's works.  It is better than the toxic waste that Franco Zeffirelli made in 1968, but still suffers in casting and other departments.  I am happy that Kenneth Branagh didn't get involved with this as he is destroying the basis of the plays.Unfortunately, the camera style (and music) are all too reminiscent of a music video and this winds up looking (and sounding) like Michael Bay made this movie.  Ohmigosh, I just hurled the ultimate insult!  I still would really love to see someone like Ridley Scott or Steven Spielberg make an adaptation since they are certainly more intelligent directors.Leonardo DiCaprio was a poor choice for Romeo, I was unable to sympathize with him or the idiots that casted him.  Claire Danes isn't any better with her delivery.  I will say that Pete Postlethwaite (probably the smartest actor on the production) captures my defining image of Father Laurence.  He gets my kudos for the movie.Overall, a Shakespeare movie that is almost worth your time if you are too braindead to read the plays yourself.  A more thinking person should do the latter.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,2,16 August 2003
Forrest Gump," Shining over the darkness
","Forrest Gump is touching to the melodramatic and sensitive.  Problem is, Robert Zemeckis is more concerned about glossing over the moments that viewers would find objectionable in order to make it more of a 'happy-family-safe-crowd-pleasing-money-maker'.  With Back to the Future and Death Becomes Her he wasn't as concerned about that, hence they were better movies.Such moments as drug addiction, exploitation, PTSD, the horrors of Vietnam, and the tirade of political violence that flows through the movie are done more for laughs or extracting faux-sentimental emotion from the audience rather than any actual history lesson in the works.  I can only imagine how Terry Gilliam or Oliver Stone of all people would have handled this.On the technical level, Forrest Gump is a trip.  As Zemeckis said, 'It's not trying to wow you' and it doesn't.  CGI is used here the way it was supposed to, as a supporting element that enhances the experience.  The editing is also pretty good, many scenes flow into each other effectively and create interesting parallels.  Zemeckis also is finally concerned about what he puts on the screen, thus the cinematography is far better than anything else he previously did.  Hanks' performance is certainly inferior compared to Philadelphia or Saving Private Ryan.  What was the Academy thinking?While some may wax nostalgia about the passage of time from the 50s to the early 90s in American history, I will try to be supportive of the fact that the film keeps moving.  Unfortunately, the message (and hence the purpose) of the movie is constantly hammered at the audience in a fashion that celebrates foolishness.  How uninventive from a Hollywood 'whiz kid'.Overall, halfway decent, albeit sugarcoated, film.  If you want real history, watch Schindler's List instead.  3 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,5,11 August 2003
The Godfather: Part II," Apocrypha
","This is when Pacino still tried to be human, though right after 'Serpico'. This is in his pre-DePalma days.That and the plot itself are needless in this case.  As with the original, crime drama plots follow similar story topics.  The differences lie in the acting, editing, characters, and camera.The editing here is less refined, trying to be Kubrick when this is Coppola. It isn't ponderous, but it's a contradictory style--much like 'The Thin Red Line'.The camera is the same as before, not trying to do anything we haven't seen. Even Frankenheimer's 'Manchurian Candidate' contains more visual fluency than this effort.The characters/acting are where the giant U-turn occurs this time.  This has no basis on Puzo's book, but is completely constructed in Coppola's mind and in the actors' presentation.  Are these rational steps being made?  Most aren't.The biggest surprise--DeNiro as Brando.  In a context like this (instead of vice-versa), the range is almost unlimited.  Coppola is one of few directors to use Brando effectively, as 'Apocalypse' would prove, and here DeNiro does his best work.  Everything after this (Scorsese's works, 'Deer Hunter', 'Heat') becomes useless.  In those cases he is bored.  In 'Untouchables' he's energetic.  Here--he's duplicating a master.For that reason alone you should see this.

Léon: The Professional," Professional
","Luc Besson doesn't hold any record in my book for credible filmmaking. Nikita was an interesting take on an unconventional subject (or an unconventional take on a redundant subject, you decide), The Fifth Element was not as good as people will profess, and The Messenger got too weighted down.  Nonetheless, Leon gets marks in my book due to the following characteristics.1) Jean Reno: since this movie, he has been typecast by Hollywood time and time again whether in Godzilla, Ronin, or Mission: Impossible.  It's as if the script calls for 'french or other foreign looking guy who looks like he can kick ass', they call him.  Either way, Besson uses the role and the character of Leon around him as opposed to making Reno fit a mold.  Smart idea.2) Gary Oldman: yet another guy commonly typecast into villain roles, Oldman goes about hammering the anvil with his character and drawing the most attention to himself.  Best line: 'Bring me everyone.' 'Whadaya mean 'everyone'?'  'EVERYONE!'  Sometimes I wonder if he will ever get a decent role.  The Fifth Element was too much in the vein of Saturday Morning Cartoons and less out of seriousness.3) Natalie Portman:  as far as I am concerned, Natalie is currently a slave to the promotional department at Lucasfilm.  Until she gets out of that money pit, I will consider this her best performance.  Considering the subject at hand and the level of involvement on her character's part, this is light-years beyond any OO7 flick.4) Shifty editing: the editing is superb and complements with Besson's very European style of film.  Not once did I get the idea that a scene was unnecessary or drawn out longer than it should have.  Kudos to Sylvie Landra.Overall, an action movie less in the vein of comic books and more with pulp writing.  Better than the other blockbuster garbage of 1994.  4 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,4,27 August 2003

Williams is once again a rebel and better than his all-too-predictable role in 'Society'.

American Pie," How many ways can you say 'dumb'?
","Author's Note: I saw this movie at the behest of a friend who thinks I haven't seen anything good.  'Cameron Frye, this one's for you!'While comedies are not my forte (I do not believe in the purpose of devoting a whole movie to that purpose), this movie only solidifies my hate of the modern Hollywood machine.  I'm certain if John Hughes ever watched this he'd be thinking, 'You know, I was competing against the same crap 20 years ago.'American Pie's biggest blunder is that it relies too much on insulting the intelligence of the audience in exchange for breaking ground.  This is what made such movies as Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Breakfast Club superior.  What makes such things as Monty Python and Dr. Strangelove so ENORMOUSLY superior is that they don't think the audience is stupid enough to walk into their movie to begin with.The ultimate victim is the so-called 'heroes' themselves because they are cardboard prop-ups of the typical American high school teenage.  What are they thinking about besides sex?  Not only is this unrealistic, but it insults every other stereotype throw into the mix.  I am certain that if MTV executives got ahold of this movie they wouldn't change anything about it.Overall, there you have it folks.  An insulting, degrading, and outrageously stupid movie.

The Bourne Identity," Slaughter
","The Bourne Identity represents the latest butchering of a novel by taking some absolutely absurd liberties.  First off, Matt Damon is terrible as Jason Bourne.  His credibility is on par with Miss Piggy.Aside from the atrocious script, the film also flunks because of poor editing and camera work.  While it is not exaggerated in the MTV style of film, the Bourne Identity can simply be renamed 'The Bored Identity' because of the poor pacing and failure to create any suspense.  I don't know where Hollywood is hiring these new crew from, but ability is not one of their strong suits.  This probably has Verna Fields rolling in her grave.Marginal realism is something that Robert Ludlum attempted to create when he wrote the novel.  Being the enormous fan of the books that I am, I was not impressed by the studio's attempts to 'modernize' the story.Overall, not worth your time.

The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Projection
","After many decades of waiting, Tolkien fans finally get the lavish rendition of the books they love.  I never read the Lord of the Rings, and have no mind to, but I can say that Fellowship of the Ring is far superior to Ralph Bakshi's disastrous version from 1978.  I do not care how accurate these movies are towards the books, I am just grading them as films themselves.I have been a staunch opponent of PG-13 movies because with an R-rated film, the creators are at liberty to do whatever they want with minimal constraints.  Thus, content is typically in the view of the director, allowing them to make such works as Platoon, The Road to Perdition, and Godfather.  Bear in mind: for every good one there are thousands of bad ones.  With a PG-13 one, the producers try and cram as much objectionable material in as they can and pray that it passes the MPAA.  Thus, garbage like XXX, Pearl Harbor, and The Fast and the Furious is created that is significantly more vulgar than the likes of The Breakfast Club and Good Morning Vietnam.Fellowship is an interesting mix.  It has the seemingly mandatory introduction required for fantasy films and many of the necessary characters: an elven archer, a wizard, a brute man warrior, the comic relief.  The problem is that the presence of evil is never manifested in a determined form; it is always jumping around and changing shape.  The Two Towers is more focused in that realm, but it has its own problems.  There is a greater sense of adventure and spirit that I prefer over the enclosure of the Two Towers and, while the tone shifts, it doesn't become as preachy. Speaking of which, the message in this movie was less garbled than in the second.Peter Jackson's camera is both inventive and imitative.  He looks for interesting shots, but can't help repeating the works of others.  Flyover shots appear to be his favorite since they allow him to show more of the (artificial) Middle Earth setting.  Brian DePalma should be proud.  The makeup is decent, deservedly winning itself an Oscar.  I am not familiar with a lot of Howard Shore's music, but his work here is powerful, if a bit too forced.  Hans Zimmer could have done the same.  The sound work is pretty substandard, but it deserved an Oscar for Sound Effects Editing.Overall, a good movie that isn't afraid to go the distance.  I do not recommend it to die-hard devotees of the book.  You'll probably be disappointed.  3.5 out of 5 stars.  We'll see about The Return of the King.",7,0,0,26 July 2003
The Matrix Revolutions," Space Combat
","'This is the end.'This is your only spoiler warning...The biggest struggle with franchises is figuring out what to do next. Horror franchises dehydrate when their creative wells run dry.  The Bond series solved that problem through repetition, 40 years of the same material tweaked in minor ways.  'Star Wars' loaded too many loose ends on 'Jedi' so its inexperienced director couldn't make something tangible.Meanwhile, Indiana Jones went from the dark and sardonic in 'Raiders' to pure pedestrian so Ford and Spielberg could fail together.  The metamorphosis from selfish warrior to holy crusader too closely followed Spielberg's own change in his film philosophy.'Lord of the Rings' tried fixing its problems by referencing itself less and 'Star Wars' more.  Yet another transition: from the achievements of individuals to the actions of armies.  Another noble failure.So the third installments of the 'Star Wars', 'Alien', 'Evil Dead', and 'LotR' films are at least interestingly conceived and executed in some way. This doesn't even get that credit.  Lucas had an ace in his hand for 'Jedi', the Emperor, but the Wachowskis show here that they are completely out of ideas.The Wachowskis reuse the color-skewing technique of Mr. Fincher while mixing their characters with Jim Henson.  Thus a totally artificial environment, both intentional and unintentional.  They have created their own 'Matrix.' Once again, we get the emphasis on John Woo and Arnold Schwarzeneggar and the computer effects have revealed everything, showing how fake they are. 'Rings' and 'Alien' had the same trouble so once again 'Star Wars' comes out on top.  Another pillar fight, more squids, more bankrupt production design. It's all banal.What I find the most interesting is how the Wachowskis try rearranging the spacial requirements of film that they invented the first time around.  This is more inventive than Michael Bay, but proves to be their undoing.  Zion is the Ewok of the project, showing no imagination.I shall compare the assault on Death Star II in 'Jedi' to this because it is seeing the same event over again, but trying to put it in a new light. Lucas' first attempt was totally bland, missing every opportunity.  He got it right the second time, creating one of his two worthwhile battles (the other being Hoth).  Here we don't have that luxury as what the Wachowskis got wrong originally is flaunted.Let's hope the Brothers stop making movies now before they make total fools of themselves.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",Null,0,1,14 March 2004
The Thing," 12 Snowmen of the Apocalypse
","Spoilers exist.The Thing is a modification of ALIEN.  Not a clone, not a rip-off, but a modification.  James Cameron obviously took a lot of elements from this movie, both obvious and subtle for Terminator 2, The Abyss, and Aliens.  The characterizations are very Cameron-esque and the consistent use of props to advance the plot are extremely similar.  Horror, like action, is frequently about repeating the same core three or four elements...which The Thing does in great profundity.  Traces are evident from The Andromeda Strain, THEM!, 2001, and The Shining.  Unfortunately, the story--necessary in a film of this caliber--is more a prop to showcase Rob Bottin's wicked creations.If there are four levels of horror in the genre, with level one being ingenious, then The Thing probably is the best of level three.  There are many positive aspects to it, but so many times the story is hurt by useless cliches such as 'Guy runs off alone without telling anyone else what he's doing'.  These are minor qualms, as are my thoughts concerning the variety and quantity of weapons at the research station.  The Thing is, more or less, a condensed version of ALIENS.This is Carpenter's best movie.  He alienates the camera from the characters.  Watch the blood discovery scene, how many viewpoints and perspectives are taken into account.  Some other group scenes like the many 'fireplace' moments aren't as adaptive.  There are the usual story deficiencies and lack of sophistication (Kurt Russell the anti-hero again, who'd have guessed?), but this time there is no budget hampering like in The Fog and They Live.  Another minor qualm is why did Ennio Morricone do the music?  Carpenter could've done it himself, it sounds like his usual work. Maybe The Thing is too slick for its own good.  Many themes are used, none to their full potential, but all are subsequently more useful than the slasher icon of Halloween.  Isolation, Paranoia, Trust, and the usual crackpot biology that requires just a little research to find the holes in it.  Is stop-motion's future in horror films?  Between Carpenter, Raimi, and Burton I thought there'd be a rebirth in the technique.  So far Chicken Run hasn't sparked any renewed interest...Overall, could've used more depth.  My last qualm is The Thing uses the two stereotypes for blacks, jive loudmouth and tough boss.  The ending, IMHO, is anti-crowd-pleasing and a radical departure from the mainstream.  Kudos.

Armageddon," Destroy Earth if we keep making movies like this...
","Michael Bay, obviously tired of being harped on for being just an action junkie, turned his focus towards the stars (literally) when he made Armageddon...a cross sci-fi/apocalyptic excursion in ignoring basic laws of physics and maintaining credibility with your audience.First off, no movie with Ben Affleck in it can be good.  Everyone demanding a refund for Gigli can attest to that, those of us still wanting refunds for Pearl Harbor can sign contractual agreements to that.  I don't care if Bruce Willis is in this, Jerry Bruckheimer knows that shoving Affleck's fat face in the frame is going to get him more money in the bank than Bruce's sweaty back.  My, how times change.Furthermore, Bay's shot composition is all wrong.  Ridley Scott made thousands of commercials, yet that influence is barely visible in much of his work (until recently).  With Bay, it is all-to-obvious that he came from the realm of music videos and 30-second spots.  David Fincher also came from this world, but he has superseded any and all expectations of him, Se7en and Fight Club cement that stance in the ground.Where Hollywood gets these plots from is anyone's guess.  This is apparently one part Dirty Dozen, one part SpaceCamp, one part Moonraker, and a pinch of Star Wars thrown in for good measure.  In other words, it's scraping the bottom of the barrel.  Using 'Leaving on a Jet Plane' as a sentimental song and the equally inexpressive Liv Tyler was a faux pas on Bruckheimer's part.Overall, one big dumb movie, that's all there is to it.  1 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,4,31 August 2003
North by Northwest," Silliness Abyss
","Despite Hitchcock's penchant for perfection on two occasions (Rear Window & Psycho), this is an absolutely imbecilic excursion.  Plot holes fill the script and even Hitchcock's usual visual grandeur isn't present here.  I'll trace this to where Spielberg's trait of 'maximum suspension of disbelief' originates.  More interesting works like 'Rope' and 'Birds' have daring elements that make them stronger.Cary Grant is a block of wood.  Heck all the acting is simple by today's standards.  The plot, too, is nothing remarkable since there have been so many other 'running man/conspiracy' movies since this one.  No doubt this work of Hitchcock has dated the worst.Tony Scott tried remaking this, he failed.  Perhaps someone smarter like David Fincher or Robert Rodriguez will try again.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",1,22,83,4 January 2004
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," Dense and Denser
","The 'Terminator' series has always had its plot going against it.  Time travel is finicky business and, unfortunately, 'Terminator 3' takes an already convoluted and mixed-up time plot and changes it around.Instead of a fairly well planned plot, we get a mixture of 'Terminator 2' with 'The Fast and the Furious'.  There really isn't anyway they can top the previous movies without going overboard in one department and lagging in more critical ones.  T2 proved that.  How many different ways can they make the same car chase?Jonathan Mostow is competent as a director, but he lacks James Cameron's legendary touch.  'B-o-o-h-o-o.'  Arnold, to quote Danny Glover in 'Lethal Weapon', is 'getting too old for this sh**'.  His Terminator role lacks the villainy of the first movie or the sympathy of the second.  Everything else is unfamiliar and inferior.Overall, an unnecessary sequel.  Correction, make that an unnecessary sequel with a tremendously overblown budget.  Warner needs to know where to put their money next time.  I give this 1.5 out of 5 stars for being blatantly stupid.",1,2,6,6 July 2003
Doctor Zhivago," Detailed Background, Blank Front
","David Lean represents the old method of directing, a quaint style by today's standards, but still influential on less-energetic directors like Spielberg.This is your only spoiler warning...Here's how you can tell.  In Lean's movies there are two distinct elements: the background and the foreground.  The foreground is  simple plot devices, acting, etc.  The background is photography, hidden story materials, and even editing.In those boundaries, 'Zhivago' is a tale best explored in the background. The simplicity of the foreground is not interesting.  It resembles a postcard montage, but there are instances where the background faces its lesser counterpart...and wins.The scene in the Civil War where the Bolsheviks search through the fields for the Loyalists represent the best combination.  With Guinness as the narrator and Sharif as our focus of attention, its a typical love-triangle framed within Guinness trying to find his family members.  I expected a little more sophistication from the mid-60s.Overall, I actually find this Lean's best work.  Consider how much material was lifted from it for 'Titanic' and any other recent war-romance epic.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",Null,0,1,10 January 2004
U-571," Sinking Model
","It's interesting to chart the progress of this particular genre.  This movie is less related with 'Das Boot' or 'The Abyss' as it is with 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' and 'Wolfenstein'.  Heck, you can trace this back to the 'Great Train Robbery'.  Here's how simple it is:--Take one easily accepted form of American hero (Indiana Jones, special forces, hard-boiled cowboys, etc.) and pump them up with style and idiosyncrasies.--Take one easily acceptable form of villain (Nazis and aliens work best).--Infuse some mystical elements to add intellectual intrigue (Enigma encoders, Aztec gold cache, POWs)--Add explosives.After that, it's up to the filmmaker to try and make something interesting. Spielberg only succeeded with the first Indiana Jones because he was willing to take risks.  After that he was too bound to his post-E.T. sentimentality.Here is just boring orange fireballs with the weaker elements of 'Private Ryan' knocked it up ten notches.  Most recent war movies have that Spielbergian curse.  Meanwhile, 'Abyss' and 'Das Boot' took the two sub environments--water and interiors--and exploited them the best, respectively.  This doesn't go that far, it's 'Point Break' all over again.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",Null,2,4,29 February 2004
The Shining," Kubrick's Weakness
","This movie had such high production values and the director had such a penchant for perfection that one must wonder why this movie falls into the basic guidelines of a horror movie.  How disappointing...The suspense is rather lax because many of the characters wind up as caricatures that we can't sympathize with...not to mention the ending makes no sense in context with the rest of the story.  Kubrick's prior masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey, relied on the enigma of space to project a story without explaining everything to the audience.  Here, the movie only tells us half the story then leaves us on the wayside to make it up as we go, thereby making no sense.I wanted to like this movie. Sadly, I popped John Carpentar's The Fog in after this and was shocked as to how much superior of horror quality was present.In conclusion, this movie has only it's powerful cinematography and performance by Jack Nicholson going for it.  Everything else passes off as inferior, cliche, and mood-destroying.  See any other Kubrick movie for a better experience. Overall, 2 out of 5 stars.",3,1,7,10 May 2003

","The Concept: 'Fast Times' meets 'Streetcar' meets 'Catch-22'Despite what the Top Grossing Lists will tell you, 1999 brought us some interesting efforts. Just ignore the vile 'Star Wars' prequel and the upstart 'Star Wars' ripoff, 'Matrix', and the tons of politically-correct filth.'Three Kings' was energetic and satirizing, but it steeped too much in nobility. 'Fight Club', the best of the lot, explored both narrative and vision. Here we have the father of 'Club''s photographer showing that he still knows a thing or two about awareness and aesthetics.This is your only spoiler warning...Ironically, Spielberg didn't expect this to have so much 'raw truth.' Why aren't we surprised? He lied to us about suburbia, establishing the stereotypes, in 25 years of ignorance.Here the stereotypes are gone. The father (in Kubrick reference) lusts after the synthetic Lolita, both symbols of commercialized art. The materialistic mother and homophobic neighbor love guns. But it's in the druggie son where Mendes invests his perspective. Just as Kubrick invests in Curtis in 'Spartacus', the photographer becomes our center.Thankfully, Janney, Cooper, Bentley, and Birch understand what's happening, but Spacey strikes me as being too 'spaced out.' Why does he continually recycle the same mannerisms? Why do we think he's the new Brando? This certainly is better material than anything Tennessee Williams concocted and Conrad Hall was probably one of our 10 Best Photographers ever. Will Conrad Jr. live up to expectations?As for Mendes, he leaves me with a feeling of uncertainty. From this and 'Perdition' he has proved to be competent and even intelligent, but I hope he doesn't fall into the same sentimentality trap that killed Spielberg. Give him another five years and we'll find out (that's how long it took me to decide Fincher was worth following), but for now this is his take on DeVito.Something to be said about Thomas Newman, can he do wrong?Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",Null,0,1,21 May 2004
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Glaring time inconsistancies made up for by incredible FX (SPOILERS!)
","Okay, Terminator 2: Judgment Day is probably my most addictive movie; ever since I saw it at age 8. Yeah, I was probably to young to see it, but what are you going to do, send a terminator back in time to PREVENT me from seeing it? Anyway, I label it my most addictive movie because while I feel it's not the best movie ever made like some other people, I still have an urge to see it quite often. While one can go on and on about how often the concept of time gets screwed up (example: Judgment Day is to happen in two years judging from Sarah's prologue. Arnie latter explains Cyberdyne's work as taking place 'three years from now' and SkyNETs origins as later on). The whole plotline of events is really messed up and I was just hoping Arnold would be the killer again. Instead, Robert Patrick has to try and be as menacing as possible, which doesn't come off all that well. Oh well, maybe next time. The teaser/credits scene makes up for the gaping action hole in the middle. The movie itself definitely could've been a lot shorter. Hopefully with Terminator 3 they will get what they got wrong this time right. Also, Terminator 4 should have TWO T800s trying to kill John who's defended by ANOTHER T800, Arnold would definitely get his pay that way around.",10,0,0,18 March 2002
Apocalypse Now," Coppola's Curse
","Apocalypse Now certainly maintains a high level of production quality.  Few other films are as deserving of their Oscars for Best Sound and Cinematography.  Actually, it deserved more than that.  The entire movie is one visual trip after another and director Francis Ford Coppola finally understands the value of visual artistry that he avoided in his previous work.As it is well known, the movie took forever to create and everyone suffered in the production.  Coppola, totally obsessed as he was with telling this story, almost went mad and wound up remaking Bram Stoker's Dracula.  In the end, no one came out the wiser as many of the cast and crew failed to learn any lessons from this.The movie is an interesting Vietnam-period parallel to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.  However, the moods in the two respective stories are very far apart and nowhere near as similar as one would have you believe.  I am certain that the script for Apocalypse Now was written by Milius up until the eventual encounter with Brando, then Coppola took over.  You can tell by examining the differing level of detail and interaction.The story up to that point is so brilliant in its not-so-subtle fashion of hiding the message from us that the audience feels more than a little cheated when the go ahead and hammer it at us for the last half-hour.  'The horror.  The horror.'As said, the sound creation and editing for this movie is phenomenal.  The transport us to a drugged-out, psychedelic battlefield.  Coppola's juiced-up camera work enhances the senses and tells the story gloriously with Martin Sheen's edgy narration.  The man may not be a splendid actor, but he presents a compelling case.Even more insightful (or is it insane?) is Robert Duvall.  The scene of his introduction plays out more like a carnival than a war zone with different attractions that the camera passes by, none of them holding our attention for long.  Perhaps they were trying to create some kind of symbolism with Duvall's character in all this, but he is merely a nuisance and can't supersede 'I love the smell of napalm in the morning.'Brando is the most controversial element of the story, of this I am certain. He is underplayed, too somber, and half-interested in his work.  If Duvall was a nuisance, Brando is a disappointment, not helped by Dennis Hopper's crazy photographer character spouting a load of rubbish everywhere.  Perhaps by that stage in the movie, everything was meant for explanation as the preceding 150 minutes hadn't done any of that.  I don't know...Overall, a movie I have mixed feelings about.  I recommend one viewing of it (either the original or the mammoth Redux version) to anyone who considers themselves movie lovers, film experts, or wannabe filmmakers.  4 out of 5 stars.",10,1,1,14 August 2003

","The Patriot is Mel Gibson doing his Braveheart bit all over again, this time in the 18th century.  Given that this is by the creators of Independence Day, Stargate, and Godzilla, I knew I shouldn't have gone to the theater with high expectations.Good thing I didn't because this is Braveheart redux.  This time Mel is stuck being the politically-correct hero fighting the 'evil, merciless villains' of our forefathers, the nasty 'ol redcoats.  By the end of the movie I was waiting for some non-flag waving, somber moment with some intellectual stimulation in it.  I found none.  Roland Emmerich just isn't that swell of a director and this movie is nothing great.Overall, skip this.  Someone want to count up all the times Mel Gibson has played a widower in his films?

","Edward Scissorhands is a very different style of film from Tim Burton.  All his imagination is wrapped up into one character and Depp never fails to deliver.  It's amazing that he still winds up in bad roles after almost 20 years since Nightmare on Elm Street.  No doubt he is one of the better character actors in our time.  Winona Ryder is her usual annoying self, this hasn't changed after all these years.Burton's camera is not as fun this time, he's trying to be more serious in line with his subject.  I guess this was personal for him.  The production design is not his typical goth, but is more satirizing of suburbia.Overall, better than I expected, but not as smart as I hoped.

His visual imagery is flamboyant and decorative, yet never fails to deliver the goods.  There is always a flurry of images to grasp our attention.  Granted, his typical trademarks are here, but never does the script suffer from the same problems as in his other works.Nicolas Cage and John Travolta are phenomenal in their dual roles each.  The rest of the cast isn't very deep and is more filler than anything else.  The editing job feels underdone, particularly when the action sequences get to the 'overcooked' staged.

Spider-Man," They Could Have Done Better...
","Spider-Man falls into a mix of Batman/Superman style of film.  It wants to be memorable, but it is too shallow.  If any film since 9/11 has bashed the whole 'We are United' theme too hard into its script, this is it.  I am disappointed in Sam Raimi for this.David Koep is one of Hollywood's biggest garbage writers, this is just slightly above par for his work.  The main problem is that the movie starts to build up steam, but with nowhere to go.  By the finale, the audience doesn't care what happens, just so long as the movie ends.  Unfortunately, it is obvious that this was made more with financial concerns in mind as opposed to quality film.Willem Dafoe is a good actor, but his performance is too limited here.  He needs to be more vibrant and expressive to contrast the underacting (and lack of talent) on behalf of Tobey Maguire.  He never changes mood in all his movies.  Raimi's camera is its usual unhinged self, but this time it isn't as poignant as in Army of Darkness or even Darkman.  Sound suffers big time as everything boils down to either big noises and small noises.  Poor sound design on this movie's part is not a bonus.Overall, not the best superhero flick ever made.  Sometimes I wonder where they are planning to take the genre with this stuff.  2 out of 5 stars.",10,0,1,16 August 2003
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Quixotic Fincher
","Ridley Scott really hit on something for cinematic fantasy with 'Legend.' Just think, how many millions of dollars has Warner dumped into the 'Potter' and 'Rings' franchises only for them to blindly rip from Scott's masterpiece?Peter Jackson shamelessly plagiarized the Unicorns with his own ugly mule and here the Dementors are Darkness (I should add that it's an appalling design). Besides, the plot influence of 'Legend' spread to Japan and helped forge the RPG video games. That's billions of dollars made from one source, so why duplicate Nintendo concepts? They've already been taken by anime (now under Disney control in the US).This is your only spoiler warning...The first two 'Potter' films stunk. The director, Columbus, was a hack from the Spielberg camp of amazing us superficially versus filmic stimulation. They weren't even competent in those regards. Rowlings' formula has come to the point where she doesn't need to write anymore and should hand the rights over to Disney. But, rather than risk what Disney would do with it, she leaves it to exhibitionistic Warner--currently financing the most expensive projects of late, including this.It's Rowlings' ineptness that will probably strike many as juvenile. The writing is dumb like before, but no one has been brought in to change that philosophy. Consider, Oliver Stone made Johnny Depp the translator in 'Platoon.' Besides being a communication tool between cultures, the translator is supposed to be a master of words and dialect. Obviously, Depp has taken that to heart in his method.So to tackle the words we get a Shakespearean cast including Thompson, Christie, and especially Oldman (I'll get to that later). We even get Davis back in fantasyland after Howard abandoned him. My only complaint is that Dumbledore is exceedingly dull this time, why couldn't Branagh have taken over? That would be interesting.But that's all pointless in this film. It's all about technicals. Our photographer comes from Alan Parker this time, not Gilliam, and we have the designer of 'Elephant Man'. This is probably Craig's best work since then. The editor is pedestrian and Williams shows he is running out of tempo ideas. What really got me this time was costume design. The first two were bland, but this shows real talent in understanding colors and shape.It's amazing to see such ability overriding 'Troy.' 'Troy' had enormous amounts of technical talent, but Petersen royally screwed up the vision. Here we have a newer, fresher vision. This is Cuaron's third adaptation and shows that he finally knows what he's doing. In many cases he borrows from images we've seen before--'Wizard of Oz', 'Matrix', 'Rescuers Down Under'--but that's not his focus. Notice how, unlike the first two, this is muted in color. For the first half, despite the stupid story, I was held in awe by this Fincher-grade work straight from 'Alien3'. Too bad it didn't last into the next half.Other impressive elements:--Many scenes are constructed visually straight out of 'Catch-22' and the more dramatic lightshows are less Columbus and more directly Spielberg. Yes, I'm thinking of 'Close Encounters' and 'Empire of the Sun.'--The werewolf subplot was fumbled, but compare it to 'American Werewolf.' Rather than emphasize the Batman concept of duality and regret, we get an appreciation of the British countryside. Very nice landscapes.--Speaking of which, the cast is finally learning how to use our eye Cuaron is more appreciative in his gaze than Columbus (that could be it). Notice how Watson and Radcliffe shine more exuberantly now than before. Even Thompson does.--Now comes, quite possibly, the biggest change. The notion of play-within-play has been used before (Cervantes made it common), but this is expertly handled. This is what Zemeckis tried in 'Future' with 'Run Lola' added in--and probably why they got a Hispanic director. Watch as the characters interfere with themselves and are concerned with the passage of time. I bet it's because of this quasi-parallel universe that Oldman got the title role. Now I just wish we'd seen more of him, he's the British Depp.So, given the hamhanded attempt at maturity, this is what 'AvP' should be...the fifth 'Alien'. Not as dark as 'Empire Strikes Back', but I give kudos for trying real hard. I'll probably regret my rating later, but this is probably the most interesting sequel we'll in the near future.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",10,0,2,5 June 2004
Aliens," I can't bring myself to hate this movie
","I tried and I tried and I tried.  I found every fault I possibly could with the plot (who's left behind on the Sulaco?), the effects (nice obvious rear-projection work), the characters (well, now we know where the origin of 'Spunkmeyer' came from), and even the name.  Even so, I couldn't bring myself to hate it simply because ALIENS remains one of the most engaging and intense films ever created.There is not the suspense and horror of the first movie, but James Cameron knew that there was no way to top it.  So, instead of ruining our expectations of a fright-fest, he delivers one of his typical sci-fi action thrillers.  Honestly, this dude pretty much is responsible for such things as Battlefield Earth and Men in Black with the kinds of things he creates.There is the much-applauded Special Edition, but, other than providing some detail on Ripley's family and the sentry gun scenes, there isn't anything new to offer.  In fact, the scenes on the colony (pre-infestation) ruin whatever tension there would have been.Cameron's directing talent is never great (even in Titanic), though here he is able to tell a good story (convoluted as it is), carry our attention through incredible editing and visuals, and still have some interesting dialogue.The cinematography and production design is far inferior to ALIEN. However, due to the swiftly changing mood of the movie, we are blessed not to have to see them too much.  Some scenes such as the dropship embarking towards the processing plant and the alien battles are interesting to watch.James Horner is one of the most underappreciated composers of this day and age.  His music here, albeit cannibalized from his prior work, still sets an appropriate mood with more than an accational nod towards Jerry Goldsmith's original score. Kudos.  The remainder of the sound effects are original and ear-catching at best, dull and repetitive at worst.All in all, a good ball-bustin' actioneer that should stick with you for a while.  4.5 out of 5.

The Fast and the Furious," Lifeless American Evil
","MPAA ratings are a gas (I prefer the Canadian rating system) since they are so concerned with political correctness rather than actual content.  My favorite descriptor?  'Fight Club'.  And I quote:'Rated 'R' for disturbing and graphic depiction of violent anti-social behavior, sexuality and language.'They don't get better than that.  And copycat garbage like 'Fast and Furious' only shows where the MPAA goofs up.  Here we have something where violence, sex, and 'language' isn't the point.  Since this is only an exercise in brain decay, it should be quarantined from populated areas with Ron Howard's work.If a film like this fails to even entertain, it has no soul.

The Exorcist," Lasting Evil
","It's solely because of this movie that Friedkin remains in Hollywood. 'Connection' let him to pass off his lazy method as 'documentary-style', but the last 30 years have flaunted his ineptness.  All he will likely be remembered for is his minute contribution to the ever-changing world of car chases and this.  Everything else is insipid trash.This is your only spoiler warning...This is his best work for two reasons, both related to film as an art form. There is so much detail in the subtexts.  The Catholic church is shown as theological gangsters and the doubting priest is a total product of the late 60s counter-culture.  Strange, from anti-religion to part of religion.  Of course, it all boils down to superstition versus science.  It took 'Ghostbusters' to change that mentality in the favor of science and nerds.Secondly, I believe movies didn't become worth listening to for sound design until the 70s (I'm not referring to noisy trash like 'Star Wars' and 'Close Encounters') and this is one of the better examples.  It isn't as effective as 'Catch-22' and 'Apocalypse Now', but it forges a bridge to the mastery of audio in the 80s.  Also, I should mention the Iraqi desert in the opener. Why do so many visual narratives use deserts whether the Leone Westerns, 'Close Encounters', 'Hulk', and even RoadRunner cartoons?  What is it about that environment?  I love it!  At least Friedkin didn't screw it up here even though his camera is all zoom, zoom, zoom.Something should be said of the presence of Islam in this movie.  Few horror films, let alone religion-associated ones, include this in any form; so it's fairly unique.  Also, compare Burstyn's single mom character to any Spielberg associated horror film: one is dark, the other is optimistic.Funny, the one-eyed blacksmith sees all and the crude director's head gets reversed.

Gandhi," Not the Man
","Attenborough is a British Altman.  He doesn't make a film because the story is good (though here he claimed it was his life's mission), but rather he makes derides the social structure.  His 'Bridge Too Far' wasn't 'MASH', it was better and more cinematic.  Why the Brits don't catch on is beyond me. He later emphasized his point with 'Chaplin.'This is your only spoiler warning...Unfortunately, most of that talent is lacking here, Unsworth died and Gibbs went on to other things.  Also, Attenborough shifts the focus from the man (Gandhi) to the masses, thus the framing of the assassination. Interestingly enough, though Gandhi is our hero, our narrator is Martin Sheen.  Just watch him giving his cable, taking our reactions and putting them in words.  Unfortunately, it's rather redundant.In 'Bridge' there was an infatuation with transportation.  Think about it. The angelic grace of the airplanes.  The tight rumble of tanks.  The skittishness of jeeps.  None of that is here despite the plethora of cars, ships, planes, and trains.  I bet its because the two photographers were more interested in focusing on people than transportation and it shows how visually dull this is.  Filming a nice sunrise/sunset to change the boring landscape does not constitute great cinematography.  Why wasn't David Watkin hired for this one?One scene does stand out, the massacre.  Here the fluidity of 'Bridge' returns as we intercut between the soldiers (different angles), the crowd, Ed Fox, the spent casings on the ground, and the fleeing mob.  Eisenstein must have been popular in Britain in the early 80s as this and 'The Wall' show.The whole racism issue is as insipid as those in 'Mockingbird' and 'Mississippi Burning.'

Spirited Away," Japanimation Sleight of Hand
","The Concept: 'City of Lost Children' meets 'They Live' meets 'Beauty and the Beast'Spoiler Warning...If there's one good thing the insipid 'Harry Potter' series has done, it's helped marginally raise our understanding of magic.  Lynch tried explaining it with 'Dune'--the best attempt in a sci-fi setting.  None of that understanding is taken into account here, its only a lightshow.I am continuing my study of animation styles and this was one of several anime that I examined (the others being 'Vampire Hunter D', 'Akira', 'Golgo 13', and 'Mononoke Hime').  I noticed one consistent theme: the art styles are all the same.  Characters suffer from 'Pokemon' design.  One motif is interesting: giant, amorphous blobs.Here in America I've found at least four styles--the exaggeration method of Disney & Bluth, the CGI teams, the TV method of 'Heavy Metal' and its ilk, and the reality obsession of Bakshi.  It's taken us 80 years to reach this point.  Will the Japanese catch up?What really frustrates is the scant material in anime stories.  If a story leaves enough open ends for me to create another interpretation, I've just found my entertainment.  Example: 'Falling Down' is really a dream by Michael Douglas in the midst of a traffic jam.  Duvall is just a mental extension of himself that shoots him in the end.  Layman's terms: Douglas dreams of rampage, stalking and killing himself.  How good is that?We get no such opportunities here.  This isn't even 'Alice.'  Alice was about wordplay, integration of reality into fantasy, and surrealism.  Here we get some simple surrealism and nothing else, even the protagonist is sexless.The most interesting part is that Disney and Pixar managed the American release.  Since Disney's conventional team has quit, they are taking stock in anime in order to ride the popularity wave.  Disney should produce their own anime under Tony Scott or John Carpentar (since anime is identical to their styles).  The story would have the layering of 'eXistenZ' and the visual philosophy of 'Fight Club.'  Wouldn't that be cool?Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",1,19,93,6 June 2004

The Usual Suspects," a genius is never appreciated in his own time...
","That, and a few other choice words, went through my head when I finished watching this.  Judging from the meager earnings this achieved at the box office, people weren't wanting to accept the incredible amount of plot in this movie. Pity.The script seriously deserved the Oscar it won.  No other movie I can think of has such an involving plot that I can't see why people find this movie confusing.(SPOILERS) Poor Mr. Ebert. He's so smacked upside the head with straightforward junk like Titanic and Strange Days that he can't follow an involving storyline.  He needs more brain cells in his head if he wants to keep critiquing films and follow a plot.  The ending, by far, comes out of the blue but is not a deus ex machina that some might expect.  Other than that, I'm not ruining it.  See it for yourself.Overall, really interesting and a good example of getting an incredible cast, a phenomenal writer, and some great pacing.  This movie is ONLY 104 minutes!  Some of the plot rubbed me the wrong way, but I can stand it with things like this and the Maltese Falcon because they are meant to be mysteries...and the 'Usual Suspects' is probably THE mystery of the 1990s.4 out of 5.

Independence Day," They won't make this movie again...
","Roland Emmerich is overrated, I'll start my review off that way.  StarGate was a made-for-TV flopperoo, Godzilla was...nevermind, you know, and the Patriot tried repeating most of the formula elements from this.Would they make a movie these days featuring the White House and other prominent American landmarks exploding in a cacophonous fashion?  I doubt it.Furthermore, ID4 is so loaded with sappy gung-ho patriotism reminiscent of that summer's other blockbuster, The Rock, that I couldn't help but gag.  Do they have to make such messages so painfully obvious to the audience by whacking them upside the head with it every five minutes?Another problem rests in the gross excess of characters.  While trying to create a microcosm of America (read=the world), the script only gets to be one titanic logic headache after another.  If 1/3 the characters and 'convenient' relationships existed then this might've been something better.Overall, War of the Worlds for the Information Age, but just as mind-numbingly bad as Wing Commander and Supernova.

The Dirty Dozen," Where it all began...
","If you look at the elements in this movie, you'll see that all the prerequisites for the modern 'summer action movie' are all here.  This is the great-great-grandfather to Con Air, The Rock, and Tomb Raider.1. You have your politically-correct (IE: multi-racial) group of criminals (in Hollywood terms, they are the 'tough guys' that sell the most tickets') that are somehow more 'human' than the authoritarian figures that have enslaved them for a purpose.2. You have your paper-thin enemy with two options open to them: shoot or die.  Guess which one is performed the most?3. There is the obligatory bond of kinship that arises during times of war as the men learn that they are all rapists, murderers, thieves, vandals, and basket cases--sorry, too much of Breakfast Club influence on the ol' critic here.4. After nearly two hours of babbling (typical Bruckheimer tough talk), the plot works its way towards the final fireworks.  I will praise the DoP for his work in making a prototype for hundreds to follow, but the sound and editing otherwise are terrible.  Low standards for a movie like this.Overall, interesting for history buffs attempting to trace the roots of the genre, but modern filmgoers will be turned off by its *lack* of action.  3 out of 5 stars.",9,0,2,27 July 2003
Legends of the Fall," The Sudden Stop at the End
","I'll keep this short. I really do not like Zwick's style of film--reason being that he sees the story and characters as the most important elements. In his films we are supposed to watch characters work the plot out. Boring.People alone does not make good cinema. If you want people, read a book because you can imagine the person in a better context.That's why Zwick's images fail. Real artists like the Scott brothers or Kubrick think in images first, all else comes second. Zwick thinks that people drive films and so emphasizes the importance of the actors. He can only make his work 'so beautiful' before it detracts from his requirements for the story. That's where he loses.Compare the boredom of World War I here with what Gilliam did in '12 Monkeys'; a thousand times more interesting on less money.Why we don't notice this (and why his stuff has had three Oscar noms for photography) is beyond me. Everything here is primetime TV drama-grade material from the music to the editing. So abysmal.",Null,1,3,10 September 2004
Days of Thunder," Brother's Keeper
","NASCAR is probably the most idiotic sport in America that keeps attracting audiences.  The only element that makes it unique, of course, is the promise of crashing.  Hours of boredom for the promise of action, much like common view of Bruckheimer's projects.  It's also the only thing that keeps fans coming back.  Since this project starts with an insipid frame (NASCAR racing), it must either have visual flair--which dies quickly--or subtexts in the metagame.I will skip commenting on plot and visual flair because this is, after all, a Bruckheimer production.  Jerry has his own 'slave crews' ranging from sound teams to photographers and editors.  He even has directors and composers in his pocket--here it's Tony Scott and Cruise with Zimmer in support.No, I saw this to compare what Tony does with Cruise compared with what Tony's brother, Ridley, did in 'Legend'.  In 'Legend', Cruise is a cog in the grand machine of things (like the character structuring in 'ALIEN'). Here, Cruise is the machine running things--how ironic.So Tony, Tom and Jerry try and still fail again.  Tony would try sports again with 'Boyscout' while Bruckheimer returned to Cops and Military genre with someone else--Michael Bay.  Ironically, Ridley's foray with Jerry differed because Scott passed off his vision for 'Blackhawk' as 'macho-gung-ho 'Top Gun' stuff' and Jerry fell for it.Jerry has made only three interesting efforts (the first 'Cop', 'Blackhawk', and 'Pirates') so far.

Needless to say, by the 15th showing, the message got old and the humor was lost.The message is the only asset in the movie.  The story itself is sugar-coated and so politically-correct that it can make the more stone-stomached viewers sick.  Teamwork, that is the point.  I am happy to say that there is no stereotyping here, but the movie falls into more of a Forrest Gump category of crowd-pleasing.Denzel Washington is the typical good guy who is always right.  I swear, he could be on Jeopardy and beat Stephen Hawking since he's so smart.  He needs more roles, not like John Q, though, that expand his repertoire.Overall, more of Jerry Bruckheimer's appeal to to dollar.  Thankfully, this is less dumb than most of his work.

He frequently goofs projects up with his pedestrian, lethargic manner.  Also, there's too much pandering against the modern youth culture.  I can appreciate such actions in 'Calvin & Hobbes' when both sides (mostly balanced on the fulcrum of TV) are intelligently handled, but this is too simple.  Shame on Goldman.I did not leave this movie feeling like I'd experienced something unique. Disney used the self-irony method for 'Pirates' and had two competent actors to balance Bruckheimer's exuberance.  I can see why other people would like this, but I'd just as soon forget it.

Saving Private Ryan," Best War Movie Ever?
","No.  That is all in the opinion of the viewer.  The AFI can hail 'Citizen Kane' the best movie of all time, but then cast a blind eye towards 'Aliens' in their 100 Thrillers.  Moral: No one is infallible.To be blunt, there are good war movies (Das Boot, Apocalypse Now) and there are bad ones (almost anything with John Wayne fits here).  Saving Private Ryan is a good war movie, even great at some points, but once again Spielberg falls into the 'sentimental showman' trap that frequents his films.  Whether in Empire of the Sun, Schindler's List, or Indiana Jones 3, he starts trying to evoke an emotional response by trying too hard.  As they say 'the harder you try, the dumber you look.'As far as general film quality goes, this movie is superb.  Kaminski's tight camera angles coupled with the color desaturation gives 'Private Ryan' an almost black-and-white archaic look reminiscent of a WWII documentary.  The characters look gaunt and pale, enhancing the sickening look of the movie.Is this better than 'Shakespeare in Love'?  Certainly, but not as good as 'Life is Beautiful'.  Unfortunately, 'The Thin Red Line' does not match up because Malick winds up making just an art film.  Should Hanks have gotten the Oscar?  Yes, compared to 'Forrest Gump', he is far above that level here.  Seen one war movie, seen them all.  That's what you should understand before watching this.  There is no difference between 'Platoon', 'Full Metal Jacket', and 'All Quiet on the Western Front' compared to this.  They all have the same characters, the same morals, the same conclusions. Bummer.John Williams: someone give the guy a complementary Oscar.  I have yet to hear a bad composition on his part other than 'Midway'.  In addition, the makeup and production design are far superior to the 'Shakespeare in Love'.Most compliments go towards the opening 25 minutes of the movie--and it deserves it.  I feel that the final battle should seriously get more credit than it has.  Michael Kahn's editing and the super sound work enhance the fight in an almost 'Wild Bunch' fashion.  Overall, very good example of Spielberg in his serious mode despite many flaws in both plot, character, and continuity.  4.5 out of 5. It still isn't the best war movie ever made.",10,0,2,18 May 2003

Spielberg, after the box office failures of 1994-1996, and the critical failure of 'Lost World' finally hits the big time, THE TALENT IS BACK! This movie is definitely only for adults.

The Pianist," Play By Memory
","Some irony: every time a director attempts to be visually daring, the public doesn't accept it.  Scott tried in 'Blade Runner', Cameron in 'Abyss', Spielberg in 'Empire of the Sun', and Kubrick in 'Barry Lyndon'.  Why? Maybe because the scripts aren't accepted...This is your only spoiler warning...Here Polanski is visual in a different sense than these.  Spielberg is an emotion-control freak determined to manipulate our every reaction in order to make us accept his vision.  'Schindler' especially relied on this tactic; weaving images, emotions, and especially music together.Polanski survived the Holocaust, so most detail stems from his memory and not imagination.  So, while Spielberg is a Hollywood Jew reminiscing on the Holocaust, Polanski is the real deal.  His impersonal method is intentional since reality doesn't have background musical cues to warn us about upcoming suspense.  Polanski's focus is also different from his Western brethren. Compare his visualization of the ghetto wall to what Spielberg did with the 'Jurassic Park' fence.  The emphasis is not on people, it's circumstance. Brody is keen to surviving in these circumstances after 'Thin Red Line'. The last time Spielberg tried this was 'Raiders'.Here Polanski is darker than Spielberg.  Optimism is beat to death despite the loops the script takes into 'made-for-TV' Land.  Compare the 'girl in the red dress' in 'Schindler' to the ghetto-runner boy.  It's about comparing imagination to memory.'Training Day' had the same problems, but less insight into getting around them.Film is music though the two art forms are different creatures.  Both rely on pacing, measure, and beat, but film has three dimensions to sort through. This is distant and impersonal, yet understanding.  Thus, Polanski shows he is more human than his Hollywood counterparts that want to amaze. On that note, this sorely deserved an Oscar for Best Sound.

","Seabiscuit is one of those typical sentimental flicks that uses moments of heroism from either the characters or circumstances in order to gain audience approval.  If I had a dollar for every time I ran across such scenes whether in this, Forrest Gump, or Braveheart I could retire right now.What I cannot figure is the narrative structure.  The creators send us a flurry of images in the style of watching 'The American Experience' on PBS, then revert back to a 'typical movie.' If they wanted this to be a history lesson, emphasize the former, if they want drama, then the latter.  I am happy that they kept an even balance.Tobey Maguire is the new Matthew Broderick, but he lacks the ability of expression that Broderick had already mastered.  In other words, his performance is no different than in Spider-Man or Pleasantville.  It's the writers that make his backstory that form our sympathy for him, not his acting.Patriotism is a poor substitute for intelligence, but this movie knows that it isn't smart (Hollywood self-awareness? amazing!) so it doesn't try.  It reverts to the old 'class war' motif, so change 'patriotism' to 'pride' instead.Overall, a nice film that is at least halfway decent.  My only major criticism is the amount of money they spent on it.  Did they really expect to get a profit out of this?  3.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,0,10 August 2003
1941," Eagerness Equals Embarrassment
","Possible spoilers...This movie is actually pretty good when seen in the right context.  'Blues Brothers' doesn't need the context, but this requires a little thinking to get through it.  Audiences in '79 couldn't because Spielberg hadn't given us enough of his brain to work with.  He created a giant behemoth and we were wondering what it was about.Comedy works only when you can take something the audience can understand and relate to, then taking some spins with it.  In this regard, it's one of the hardest genres to win in.  Scott got his right the first time ('Matchstick').  If this film had worked long ago, Spielberg would've been changed for the better...maybe.Let's see how '1941' becomes interesting:--Spielberg's World War II obsession.  He understands the time and mood of the film far better than, say, 'Temple of Doom or 'Last Crusade.  The gung-ho soldiers are obviously a variation of 'Private Ryan.--Suburbia.  Since 'Close Encounters (and even 'Jaws') we have always worked in this environment and given Spielberg money for it.  'E.t', 'Poltergeist', and 'Minority Report' come to mind right away.--Our writers.  Spielberg has invented his own 'camp' of filmmakers of which he is Der Fuhrer, visually-speaking.  Zemeckis is probably the cleverest of the campers, but only with the layered 'Future' series and 'Death Becomes Her'.  Since then he's been disappointing all along.  Milius is not of this camp and his inserts here (and in 'Jaws') stick out like Tarantino in 'Crimson Tide'.--Comedy.  Of all Spielberg's comedy efforts, this is his best that doesn't try being sentimental.  Think of it, since 'Minority Report' Spielberg has been trying to make us laugh and hasn't had any luck.  Look at the miserable 'Terminal' if you don't believe me.See this in conjunction with 'Hook' and 'Empire of the Sun'.  With these three you can see the Spielberg machine doing some interesting things without too many commercial trappings.  Once you're familiar with the rest of Spielberg's work, then watch this.

He should have spent more time with Amistad and left this to another person who wanted a chance at the big leagues.

"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," Fluid Medium, Stagnant Particles
","This is your only spoiler warning...This was my second Lee film (after 'Sensibility'), but I still didn't give him any credit until a few years ago.  I see 'Crouching Tiger' as his method of gaining pop status, not pushing limits.  Compare the content here to prior junk in 'Matrix'.The story is a farce, too simple.  How many Bruce Lee, John Woo, or even Peckinpah films have been loaded with the same filler?  Even the acting is just flat.  Four years later and no performance rings in my mind.  I'm wondering if Lee ever examined Kurosawa's work because so much could have been applied.I guess Lee wanted to be Raimi and Woo but didn't want to prove that he was better.  Raimi's films are always stupid in the basic qualities because they rely on his visual intuitiveness.  Woo has been making the same movie since 'Heroes Shed No Tears', never deviating from formula.It's in that respect where I hold Lee in high regard: always trying to do something new.  Woo, Cameron, and Burton all found their niches, but I doubt Lee ever will.  He'll keep experimenting and I will admire him for that.So here is an uncomplicated look at an old genre.  Performed by a master, but clumsily so.  'Hulk' showed Lee really experimenting with the comic book medium, but there isn't any new blood in this project.

JFK," Eye of Dread
","Having reviewed The Silence of the Lambs, Terminator 2, and JFK for the first time in 10 years, I can easily say that JFK undoubtedly deserved its Oscar for Best Film Editing.  The film moves, flows, and never loses pace or interest.  Its three-hour length flies by at quickening speed and remains captivating to the audience, something Born on the Fourth of July couldn't do.  The use of multiple types of film also emphasizes its difference, something Oliver Stone couldn't have done five years before with Platoon.Now comes the nuts and bolts of the film.  I will but blunt when I say this next part, but I am NOT watching this film for a history lesson!  If I want a history lesson, I'll contract one of Michael Moore's quack faux-documentaries (shame on you, Mr. Moore!) and take notes.  Otherwise, Oliver Stone creates an incredible film here that would have been stronger...if it were the truth.Kevin Costner has obviously fallen in the public light since this film and his acting is lower grade than in The Untouchables.  Nonetheless, he portrays Jim Garrison with an almost quiet insanity.  Somewhere behind those glasses is a fierce animal waiting for the strike.  The remainder of the cast is not given enough to do other than be names we memorize and then forget.  Tommy Lee Jones presents an interesting multi-layered character that Stone obviously holds in contempt.Overall, a brilliant film that--historical notes aside--shows how a modern movie should be made.

Hellboy," Stale Palette
","There's a new trend in Hollywood where low-key directors are making personal statements.  'Hellboy' is the third I've noticed this year.  Mel led with his Renaissance-inspired 'Passion' and del Toro actually follows in similar footsteps.The plot is silly, we knew that, and follows the prerequisite path of explaining the hero's origins.  Despite his failings in other areas, at least Burton didn't start off that way.  Since no comic book adaptation is neither good acting nor good scripting, this doesn't have to worry about competing in that perspective.Unfortunately, these rely on the visual realm.  After all, they're based on comic books, not novels.  The best example so far is 'Hulk' since (unlike recent adaptations) the eye becomes the most important element.  So we have elaborate framing and layering of static images just like a comic book.  I respect that revolutionary attitude by Ang Lee.While 'Hellboy' doesn't have the same visual energy (the music and art direction are bankrupt of ideas), I do like the use of colors.  Hellboy is constantly in environments that work with his skin tone, but I was surprised by scarcity of efficient dark coloring.  'Crow' hit upon the idea, but this tries to make up for it with a darker script.  In that subtext, 'Batman Returns' is still king by retaining the original tone of comic books--pessimism--the bestSo, in conclusion, I must state that there is a difference between being a passionate filmmaker and an artist.

","I have never read any of the LOTR books (and have no mind to), I am merely commenting on the film quality itself.  Since the advancement of computer graphics, directors can now create the humungous, landmark battles that could only be hinted at in such films as 'The Empire Strikes Back'.  Other than that, there is the clunky conflicts of 'Spartacus' and 'Ran'.  Do computers make this any better?  Having seen LOTR: The Two Towers, I will say 'yes, they do'.  The battle of Helm's Deep is undoubtedly one of the largest and most interesting set pieces ever created out of zeroes and ones.Unfortunately, the rest of the movie seems vapid and more focused around the big battle than in the mood for telling an engaging and developing story like 'Fellowship' did.  Gandalf gets minimal screen time, Frodo and Sam seem totally out of place with the rest of the story, and the other Hobbits look bored for about 90% of the time.  Oh well, watch this if you have time for it. I'll go back to 'Empire' instead.  Overall: !!! out of !!!!! time-wasting viewings.",6,1,1,19 April 2003
Schindler's List," Not of love and hate, but of hate and tolerance (spoilers)
","The European Holocaust unleashed by Adolph Hitler and his deranged madmen will always be one of history's darkest moments.  To present this on film is one of the most difficult things to do, how do you present all the tragedy, horror, grotesque, and evil of the events from 1939-1945 outside of Western eyes for six long years with the sense of hope that still remained in many minds...many didn't live to see that hope come true in the form of liberating capitalists and communists.Spielberg has gone from creating fun films like Indiana Jones to drama of the first order.  Many scenes oft mentioned by critics still can resonate in our minds with both visual beauty and unflinching brutality.  The Krakow ghetto liquidation, Schindler making his various deals, the near executions and the ones that fall through, the burning of the bodies at the camps. All of this is done in a fashion unlike Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg's other big WWII movie.  Neeson is perfect as the man who is both human (immoral, corrupt, and sinful like all of us) and savior (do-gooder, compassionate).Six million Jews were burned, gassed, shot, or died of starvation in the Holocaust, such equivalence would be nuking New York.  For such horrible loss, the Jews gained a nation to call their own.  THAT is why for 70 years they have continuously fought the Arabs and never lost, to prevent another Holocaust that the UN could never stop from occuring.By far the most psychologically unique character of Schindler's List is Amon Goethe (most excellently portrayed by Ralpy Fiennes) as the cruel, SS commandant.  When he is first introduced in the Krakow winter, he is being shown the ghetto.  After his guide is almost finished, what does Amon say? Not sum racist comment or other Nazi-related speech on Aryan superiority, rather: 'Why is the roof down?  I'm f***king freezing!' He doesn't care about people, later he takes potshots at his own prisoners and uses a method of extracting information from suspected thieves that would have Primetime drooling.  In a moment of possible humanity by being remotely polite to Helen, his Jewish 'maid' brought in from the camps. Possibly resisting the urge to rape her, he beats her instead when his self-control runs out.  We are not sorry to see him die at the end.If the end or some point near the end does not cause you to reflect on your life or even just cry, you have missed the whole point of the movie that we can never again let anything like the holocaust happen--understood in places like Rwanda it is too late for that but our thoughts must be of tolerance and not blatant hate.",10,10,16,4 October 2002
The Elephant Man," Reverse Disease
","Lynch's obsession, like Burton, is on the sick, but--since 'Dune'--he has changed focus from the visually sick to the psychologically sick.  In that respect, 'Elephant Man' and 'Dune' are the epitome of mixing his two sickness.  The social sickness, the physical sickness, and the mental illness.I watched this movie with 'Death Becomes Her' because both films work in the against the (now common) makeup philosophy of Tim Burton.  Burton uses makeup to turn actors into props--something to be seen and not understood--whether in the 'Batman' movies, 'Beetlejuice', or 'Planet of the Apes'.  Only in 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Ed Wood' did he work towards making the inhuman human--then again it might be because he had Depp.With 'Elephant' and 'Death', the makeup is used to accentuate the humanity. One tries to be dramatic and the other tries to be funny, but that is irrelevant.  That's only 'scenery for the public' to comment on in quick notes.Lynch is a genius because he has a distinct vision. This film is shot like a stage and, unlike empty buffoonery like 'the Last Picture Show', Lynch uses the B&W to his advantage.  Thus, in its colorlessness, it is one of the richest experiences.This is your only spoiler warning...There is the machine imagery as an antagonist to the ideology of the plot. You can almost hear the protesters now: 'people don't hurt people, machines hurt people!'  Along those lines, it is interesting when Hurt asks the self-existent question: 'Can I be cured?'The last item of notice is the examination of the fake cathedral that Hurt builds.  Here is the world-within-world of his existence and the ambition to duplicate what he sees outside, Hopkins would follow suit with his drawing of the Duomo in 'Silence of the Lambs'.The conclusion is an obvious tie-in for 'Dune' to begin.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",Null,0,2,3 January 2004
Ghostbusters," 80s Fusion
","Ghostbusters is a trivial film in both structure and style.  It certainly isn't well edited due to many gaps in the timeline, but there are several redeeming qualities to it.  For starters, the casting is terrific.  While the scripted characters themselves are paper-thin, the writers (Harold Ramis and Dan Aykroyd) fill them with enough interesting dialogue to make things more memorable.  Ramis in particular is ingenius as Spengler. Unfortunately, his ability and character were wasted in the sequel.The film presents an interesting mix.  There is the prototypical horror hook of such films as The Exorcist and The Haunting, but it combines it with the 80s notion of 'technology can solve or do anything', evident with WarGames and Blade Runner.  Of course, Ghostbusters isn't anywhere near the level of Blade Runner, and it's all for laughs.  Nonetheless, the comedy element strikes deeper than garbage like Dumb & Dumber.  While Ghostbusters doesn't have a purpose, it certainly is trying to find it.  Interesting in a decade that shunned intelligent thinking.On the side note, I feel this movie was robbed at the Oscars both for Visual Effects and Song.  Ray Parker, Jr. isn't the 80s' greatest, but the song certainly contributed to the success of the movie.  Also, the sound editors deserve their fair share of credit in creating the interesting noises of both the ghosts and the unique 'firepower' the team wields against them.Overall, a film that has aged, but not as bad as other ones from this decade.  Essential viewing for children of this decade and comedy buffs, but more introspective reviewers who like Woody Allen should avoid it.  3 out of 5 stars.",9,0,0,23 July 2003
No Man's Land," Where's the Amerikaners?
","The Concept:  'All Quiet' meets 'Three Kings' with 'Kelly's Heroes'This is your only spoiler warning...It's always interesting to see how other countries try adopting Hollywood themes with their own nationalism.  In the case of 'Run Lola', it succeeds because the MTV style is only a frame.  Unfortunately, 'No Man's Land' makes the style its focus.  Since we've seen this style before on better movies (where 'Lola' had the edge), it doesn't last with us.The subtexts don't create a major stir when superficially examined.  Two enemies stuck in a trench because of either side fighting for reasons no bigger than simple vendetta.  Doesn't sound that great, does it?  The two men arguing harkens to 'Conan' and the spawning of conflict-obsession, but it's as sophisticated as 'Batman'.What makes this interesting?  The absence of Amerikaners.  If this was a true Hollywood or made-for-TV production (especially under Bruckheimer), there would be a plethora of American imagery.  'Behind Enemy Lines' and 'Hunted' tried this, no wonder they failed.  Here the Bosnian wears a Rolling Stone t-shirt, the peacekeepers are French, and the journalists are British.So, when putting things in non-American context, this suddenly becomes interesting despite a script that lacks sound.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material",Null,1,1,5 April 2004
The Longest Day," Obsolete
","Any war movie with John Wayne isn't worth your time, even The Sands of Iwo Jima.  He is no better here as the gung-ho airborne commander.  I don't see what the Zanuck's saw in him other than box office exploitation.The other day I sat down and made a list of all the war movies I'd seen, many of the embarrassing ones of my youth cropped up along the way and then I remembered The Longest Day.  So, in an attempt to clear my conscience, I rented it and became sorely UN-impressed.  The Longest Day has no credibility.  It is too concerned with 'Kraut-bashing' to be of any historical value and even the French are poorly represented.  It wants to be a happy-sappy excursion in futile heroics and false patriotism.  What a load of...Many scenes have aged worse than your grandmother.  What might have worked in 1962 doesn't work today.  And people thought John Hughes was bad...The depiction of war here is in the same vein as other garbage from the 50s and 60s, gung-ho and inconsequential.  Patton and Platoon, among others, covered these grounds--sometimes more preachy than in other instances.Overall, a poor excuse for a war movie.  While Saving Private Ryan is a load of patriotic hooey, at least it was concerned about people and not events. For a better understanding, watch Tora! Tora!

Moulin Rouge!," Aesthetic, Gimmicky Dragster
","The Concept: 'Romeo' meets 'Buckaroo Banzai' meets 'eXistenZ'This is your only spoiler warning...Film is, first and foremost, an art form--no different than paintings, sculpture, music, literature, or theatre.  The fact that we abuse film into entertaining us or just telling stories is humiliating.  When placed in that context, all film is art that varies in quality.  'Moulin Rouge!' is so rich in detail that it has to be fattening.I wasn't planning on liking this one.  Romance/Musicals aren't my forte. However, examining Ang Lee's 'Eat Drink' allowed me to rethink my criterion. Granted, most entries in the genres are insipid, appealing to our quest for affections, but some have other intentions.  Once you get past the silly little love story, it gets VERY interesting.Consider:--This is a movie about a book about a play with actors existing in various levels of reality.--There is a distinct layering of images, sounds, and thoughts.  Compare this to any bare-bones Alan Parker musical where everything exists 'onstage', never in relation to the audience.--Very competent editing, better than 'Blackhawk Down'.  'Blackhawk' relied on an audio rhythm.  Here the cuts are for visual fluency, it takes exposure to learn this method.  Notice how elaborate tracking shots substitute for jump cuts or editing transitions.  Watch every little nook and cranny for details and keep your eyes open for the use of color.  The sound here wasn't as good as I was expecting, 'Amelie' was 2001's best.--Modern songs (from the Beatles to Madonna) are implemented not as fashion statements.  After all, why wasn't Tina Turner's 'What's Love Got to Do With It' used?  No, the music is also prostituted: cheap and tawdry.  Hence 1899 as the 'summer of love', 1967 all over again.  We even have a supporting cast of Bohemian hippies, probably the most colorful things you will ever see.--Pay attention to the brainstorming/rehearsal scenes for 'Spectacular Spectacular', the entire ending is explained.  Notice how we accept it as good humor at first, then as 'drama' when it's revealed.  Clever, huh? Makes the 'love' concept all the more disposable.--The battles between the artists and the financiers.  Every real artist goes through these stages, frequently degrading their original visions for the sake of commercial appeal.2001 was a good year for film (with 2 Scott films, a Lynch, this, and 'Amelie', how can you lose?) and the advances made then will probably carry us through the rest of the decade.  Too bad the Oscars got everything screwed up.  If you ignore 'Pearl Harbor', 'Lord of the Rings', and 'Planet of the Apes', it isn't that bad.As for Luhrmann, I'm going to keep an eye on him.  His control here is paramount and he has a near-Scott level of attention to detail, but he's still young.  Here, in particular, he begins to run out of gas about midway (hence the 'dragster'), so I'm holding off on my final judgment on him. Let's see how his 'Alexander' comes out.In the meantime, let's see Oliver Stone make a musical.  We'd need it after the disaster of 'Chicago'.  Now THAT had no interesting layering, just 'Sound of Music' all over again.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",10,1,3,24 June 2004
Back to the Future Part III," Cliche
","In the so-called 'glory days' of the Old West, the 'good guys' wore white hats and the 'bad guys' proved their ultimate stupidity by wearing all black in the scorching heat.  Back to the Future Part III is a return to those roots in a very un-original and un-exciting fashion.  Robert Zemeckis' talent that was so boisterous in the first two movies has fallen into a layman's movie that anyone else could have made.  Too bad it took Death Becomes Her to reboot his system as to where it belonged.The story is the first problem, the plot is so ridiculously awful that it tarnishes the original beyond belief.  Second, Christopher Lloyd is wasted for the first time in a fruitless position.  In the original, he was the wacky inventor.  In the second, he was the worrisome custodian of the space-time continuum.  Here he is the melodramatic sap.  Michael Fox isn't much better as he, once again, proves that he's only good for laughs.While not as gizmo-happy as the second movie, the effects leave much to be desired.  Even the period of 1885 is not represented well.  It is all a bunch of gags and cliches that we have seen before many other times.  I preferred the sci-fi parody of 2015 instead, but I'm not a Western aficionado.The editing, yet again, is underdone and the script stumbles along in the middle third of the movie.  The camerawork isn't as inventive, but Zemeckis never has been a big stickler about what he projects.  Only in Forrest Gump has he been so concerned about that.  Finally, Alan Silvestri's score is so inferior this time around.  The previous films had a resonance similar to Predator, but The Abyss will remain my favorite compilation on his part. Unfortunately, none of that magic is here.  If only it were, how beneficial it would have been... Overall, the weakest link in the trilogy.  Why is it these movies only get worse as time goes on?  2 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,3,2 August 2003
Patton," The Flawed Hypocrite
","First off, I would like to say that the two most redeeming qualities are George Scott's (why do we insist on including people's middle initials?  no one else does in regular conversation and it makes no sense!) portrayal of the 'magnificent anachronism' and the score by Jerry Goldsmith, one of the best ever written.The problems, as follows, range from the script to the screen.  The technical support from the Spanish Army is a load of hooey and the sound work is absolutely atrocious.  Given, back in 1970 there was a general lack of quality sound editing, but this is terrible!  Also, the supporting cast is terrible.  I kept having flashbacks to the hollowness of Battle of the Bulge and Where Eagles Dare.Fortunately, the cinematography is top-notch for a 70s movie like this, even when there is too much zooming.  I noticed that, as far as quality filmmaking was concerned, Patton gets better as it progresses.  The opening up until Sicily are poorly edited, chatty, and forced in depth.  The last hour remains one of the greatest achievements in grand-scale filmmaking. Scott didn't like Patton as a person, but he has now transcended the actual person in the public limelight.  He resembles a human Panzer tank, all bulked up and firing his outbursts with absolute power.  So it goes...The message, of course, is the futility of war.  Many other movies have covered it, all with mixed results.  Scott presents an interesting case, though it is hard to believe someone as batty as Patton could get in the army, no less a four-star general.Jerry Goldsmith, who has done almost every kind of movie for Hollywood, creates a soundtrack of both rousing pomp certain to make pacifists cringe and organ postludes reminiscent of medieval times, thus enhancing Scott's throwback character. Overall, PATTON fits in my Top 10 movies from the 1970s, crazy as they are. 4 out of 5 stars.",9,3,7,22 July 2003
Kelly's Heroes," There is a smart movie in here, if only we could find it
","Kelly's Heroes is a wannabe.  Clint Eastwood proves his lack of acting ability here in a script that is both overlong and arrogant.  This movie was MADE for the 70s audience.  There is no other explanation for Donald Sutherland's character and the amount of anti-establishment ho-haw.  The plot itself lacks enough credibility for two movies.Yet, somewhere in this film is an intelligence beyond all the explosions and terrible quips.  It certainly isn't in the Mike Curb Congregation's theme song, certainly one of the worst pop songs of the decade.  There is no similarity between it and the movie, that's bad licensing.  That problem aside, the film would have been much better had the editor not been snoozing on the job.  Given the timeframe of this film, I will forgive the DoP for doing a slob-job.Overall, this is good for maybe two viewings at most.  People living outside of the time of its release should stick with Three Kings instead.  2 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,6,21 July 2003
Casualties of War," Thai-Nam
","There is a distinct difference between Vietnam movies made in Thailand and those in the Philippines.  The Thai ones try to be morality plays or generally don't understand the topic, the Filipino ones are disillusioned and disturbing...certainly more advanced than their counterparts.  Sadly, Casualties of War is a Thai-Nam movie and not a Phi-Nam one.Sean Penn does his best General Ripper/Turgidson impression and makes an interesting insane caricature.  Michael J. Fox and the rest of the squad are cardboard cut-outs necessary to make DePalma's morality play work.  Too bad half the time they are unintelligible in their reactions.The way DePalma fixes the camera as a separate from the narrative, such as in the opening with the platoon moving through the jungle, shows moderate intelligence.  When he separates the camera from the narrative--after the kidnapping for example--then thrusts it into the viewer's face by having the cast talk at it, that's brilliant.  Too bad the other elements of the film aren't anywhere near as sharp.DePalma is neither an auditory director nor an editing one.  Funny, when ads ran for Femme Fatale, he was listed as 'master of the erotic thriller.' He'll be better known as the person who reshaped the crime genre with Scarface and the Untouchables.  DePalma can't separate moods and pacing from each individual cut, Sam Raimi is already several steps ahead of him.  No better example comes to mind than the climax of 'Casualties' where DePalma throws every possible angle he can on the screen, but the editing is so cumbersome that the entire scene is ruined.  Sound work in his films is always an afterthought.Basic storytelling skills are further decimated by the horrendously unneeded prologue and epilogue with Fox back in America.  Did we really need those scenes?  Perhaps Brian should've spent more time on the script and understanding the fundamentals of film storytelling before hopping onto this project.Overall, I'll leave it at that.  Visual work alone doesn't make a good movie, but this is one of DePalma's more watchable films.  Isn't that sad? (60%)",10,0,4,18 October 2003
Mulholland Drive," Video Voyeur
","David Lynch has comfortably sat on my 'Top 10 Directors' for the last dozen years or so and for a very good reason.  He insists on twisting our reality into his surreality.  One man's banal TV show or simple joy becomes Lynch's devilish delight.This is your only spoiler warning...Yes, this is the real Best Director of 2001.  We had two of the world's finest craftsmen (Scott, Lynch), two interesting wannabes (Altman, Jackson), and one stew-for-brains.  And who won?  Take a big fat guess.Anyway, enough Academy-bashing, Lynch isn't solely focused on social commentary or visual splendor.  They help, but aren't necessary in his work. No, he's interested in twisting our perspectives.  Hollywood is presented as people with poor dialog and worse logic.  The director character (of course) is the driving force.Complaints often state that this is confusing, but I had no problem deciphering the contents.  It's about parallel & entwined lives, reincarnation, fantasizing, and 'trading spaces.'  I know that doesn't make much sense, but Lynch gets a kick each time we go 'HUH?!'  That's his ulterior motive, not entertaining with cheap tearjerkers like the talentless Howard.We see events not as omniscient beings (like in a DePalma movie), but as voyeurs.  We peer over people's shoulders and shuffle through hallways like a P.I.  Our observations contain what little information the scene wants us to have.  Meanwhile, we have films within films and infusions of greed. That's intelligent work.So this is definitely a well-crafted piece full of Lynch-isms.  I recommend it to writers and fans of 'The Shining.'  Kubrick wanted this for his movie, but his energy and focus was dying.  The music is also competent.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",10,2,5,6 May 2004
Dumb and Dumber," Vacation with Beavis & Butt-Head
","Dumb and Dumber is just that, a stupid movie without purpose.  Dr. Strangelove mixes a message with its parodizing view of the world.  The Breakfast Club combines an adolescent fantasy world of detention with the stereotypical self-discovery element.  Monty Python has an edge due to the typical Python wit, that's all I can say about it.Dumb & Dumber is no more than an enhanced, live-action Beavis & Butt-Head cartoon.  All the same pitfalls and baloney circumstances you'd expect from them are here.  Also, the movie goes too long for its own good and winds up being what I call a 'watch checker', wherein you are checking your watch every 45 seconds while thinking 'Is this EVER going to end?'  As much as I enjoy Jim Carrey in Liar Liar and The Mask, his work here is too annoying to be fun (he couldn't POSSIBLY intend on being this annoying).  Jeff Daniels gets my sympathies for getting cast into this movie, I guess there was nothing he could do other than live off the profits from SPEED.Overall, save yourself some time and just rent episodes of Beavis & Butt-Head or National Lampoon's Vacation for the same effect in your brain. The movie tries too hard to be funny and stupid and, as the saying goes: 'The harder you try, the dumber you look.'

","Tom Cruise and John Woo do not mix.  The former is too full of himself and spends too much time 'grinning like an idiot every 15 minutes' (except in Rain Man) whereas the latter is more concerned about style and pomp.  These are colliding worlds. Enter 'Mission: Impossible 2' the second, and sadly not the last, in this franchise.  I knew there was something wrong when they structured the story AROUND the action scenes instead of vice-versa.  My biggest complaint is that this is not a 'Mission: Impossible' movie, this is a James Bond/Matrix/John Woo movie.  Very little of the conservativeness of the original remains (if any).John Woo's directing goes back to his trademarks, but does not retain his original style.  Whereas 'A Better Tomorrow' and 'The Killer' were incredible action experiences throughout, this winds up to be a waste of an hour and then trying to make up for it. Even the villains aren't up to par.  Whatever happened to supervillain Castor Troy?  I for one got sick of Tom Cruise's pomp and wished that someone would just run him over with an 18-wheeler in the motorcycle chase. Imagine how much pain the audience would've been spared.Overall, lacks in all departments, particularly direction.

It's not like this is Saving Private Ryan--which is becoming cliche in its own right because everyone is comparing it to this--Patton, or Platoon.  The emphasis is not on drama--where in those movies it has to be the driving force--but rather on the grittiness and action.  I've spoken with many people from the Army that were there in Mogadishu and they said that the film captured the feel of the real events even if Scott had to B.S. somewhat.

Possibly the only other visionary who'd come close would be David Lynch. Nah, too radical.  Tim Burton?  Too sophomoric--that and he would've had too much fun with the monkeys.  How about Stan (the Man) Kubrick? Possibly.Kubrick does here what he probably has wanted to all his directing career. Create a purely visual experience without the annoyance of dialogue.  He also proves himself a master of classical music (indeed, between this and 'A Clockwork Orange' he proves that he knows how notes and images can be the most powerful tools) without using the annoyance of contemporary music. Indeed, many of the spaces scenes seem like music videos for Beethoven, Mozart, and others.Entertainment:  You do not watch this for entertainment, plain and simple. This is a soul-searching journey that might leave you stuck by the wayside if you can't understand it.  I will say this once and once only...'YOU ONLY GET OUT OF THE MOVIE HOW YOU REACT TO THE CHANGES, THIS ISN'T GOING TO SLAP YOU UPSIDE THE HEAD AND SAY 'THIS IS WHAT IT'S ABOUT!''If, after seeing this, you haven't had any kind of thoughts as to the purpose of humanity in this solar system, then you have missed the forest for the trees and the sky for the stars.On the other foot: This is Sci-Fi in the purest form.

Chariots of Fire," Rhythm
","It's interesting how composers not only borrow from themselves, but from each other.  In some cases, like 'Ed Wood', the intention theft works because we automatically associate the tunes to the time period.  In 'Fire and Ice', the notes are blatantly ripped from 'Jaws.'Here we have something accomplished and daring thanks to two geniuses.Watkin brought the visual energy, namely to the races.  Thanks to him, our perspective of athletes has changed from Riefenstahl's propaganda (now appropriated by every TV network) to 'Rocky' (another formula: character-driven).  Here the athletes are not competitors, but instead are angels.  He did similar exuberant work on 'Africa' and 'Catch-22'.The other genius, of course, is Vangelis.  I bet it's because of this that Scott collaborated with him twice.  Despite the mix of old/new concepts with the score, it works.  The equivalent today would be having Aerosmith rescore 'Braveheart'.Faltermeyer understood the music's aspirations and copied it for 'Top Gun'.Everything else is color-by-numbers, thankfully the editor understood what Watkin was doing in 'Memphis Belle'.  Even Ian Holm disappoints.  Can you imagine?  One of our 'grand old men' of science fiction not really acting? It's because of the film's triumphant theme that anything else looks good.

That's why he makes movies like this, so he stays in the limelight and everyone else gets a pension plan.Mission: Impossible is better than MI2, but that isn't saying much.  That is like comparing a car crash to a nuclear meltdown.  For starters, Brian dePalma is much more in tune with the genre than John Woo.  Second, MI is trying to be an updated Hitchcock-style thriller.  MI2 wants to be another John Woo action movie with MTV-style cinematography, loads of computer effects, and slow-motion galore.  Boring...No wonder these movies stink!  Their source material is one of the worst TV series of the 60s!  Can't Hollywood get some decent writers for their blockbusters instead of relying on David Koepp?  dePalma uses his camera in a fashion similar to the Untouchables, but here he is obviously going for the hi-tech Hitchcock spy movie (a cross James Bond and North by Northwest). It doesn't work, the formula is too contradicting.Overall, this movie stinks.  For a better understanding of modern espionage thrillers, stick with Ronin.

My question is 'where do they get the money to throw into a project like 'The Last Samurai'?  Are they trying to duplicate the hope of 'The Last of the Mohicans'?  Is this supposed to be spiritual like 'The Last Temptation of Christ'?  One thing's for sure, it's as dead of a film as 'The Last Picture Show'.

There is no more market for swaggering white anti-hero leaders, 'Far Side of the World' is proving that.

Since he wrote 'Gremlins' he's been in over his head, much like Joe Johnston.A larger jungle for the hooligan this time, more booby traps, more gags, another spooky adult, fewer laughs.  I'm disappointed that John Hughes would abandon his flair from the 80s for this franchise.Consider these 'Home Alone' movies as juvenile versions of 'Die Hard' in the barest sense.  Lone charismatic hero takes on dim-witted villains in tight quarters without backup.Today this plot seems unthinkable with the new airline regulations.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",Null,1,2,2 January 2004
Life Is Beautiful," Spastic Games
","As opposed to the in-your-face bluntness of 'Schindler's List', this works on a pretty interesting level.Some spoilers...The modern sitcom works by taking a generally quaint topic and making it as vile as possible.  Here it goes the other way by taking something enormously evil (the Holocaust) and trying to inject humor in it.Compared to Mel Brooks' self-effacing stupidity (OK, Mel, we know you're Jewish already!) this has an edge.  The concentration camp is a game--everything is seen from a child's perspective.  Notice how this continues until the end when we realize the child has been telling the story all along, not Guido.  If we had been introduced to this fact earlier, we'd know something was afoot.  Instead we get some effective, yet simple, surprises.The creators saw the Spielberg parody in this and so they quote 'Empire of the Sun' with the tank and Americans.So skip the empty first half and get to the good stuff.  After this, 'Great Escape' meets 'Producers'.",Null,0,3,1 August 2004
A Clockwork Orange," Eyelashes and Deception
","Science fiction stands apart from other genres because it is actually a setting and nothing else.  It is a toolbox of ideas and items that storytellers borrow from to try and heighten their work.  Matrix, Aliens, and Terminator are all action movies that borrow the sci-fi elements of machinery, technology, alternate realities, and souped-up firepower--that's the only thing that separates them from the Die Hard films.  Even Blade Runner is just detective noir set in 2019, no different.Only in 2001: A Space Odyssey did the full impact of unadulterated science fiction get ingrained in the public conscience because Kubrick makes the setting the star, not plot or characters.  He would later try again with Barry Lyndon to lesser extent.Compared to Sam Raimi, who isn't concerned with shot composition so long as the movement of the camera remains wild, Kubrick's parallel (or is symmetric) style is the definition of precision.  He loves orchestrating his shots around the characters in ways I'm sure Brian DePalma dreams about. The focus isn't on the people, it's on the scene and mood.  The fact that people are in the shot is incidental.That said, A Clockwork Orange is a genre-less picture.  The setting is not pure science fiction, but it certainly isn't anything other than drama. While not as declarative as Dr. Strangelove, it succeeds in making the science fiction point about what humanity's actions cause to our collective thoughts and psyches.  In this case, our newest crop of bad boys are in for some brainwashing fun.  Shallow yet insightful.Overall, between Ludwig Van's pomp and the shaky chords of 'Singin' in the Rain', Kubrick proves he is still the music man of synchronization while McDowell menaces.  4 out of 5.",7,0,0,1 November 2003
Where Eagles Dare," Grime
","If the Dirty Dozen is the father of Armageddon then Where Eagles Dare is a precursor to Bad Boys II.  It has brand name stars, but Richard Burton and Clint Eastwood interact like oil and water.  The remainder of their team is horribly miscast and suffers from lowest-common-denominator scripting.The editing easily makes this one of the worst so-called 'action movies' I have ever seen.  If Peckinpah had made this, it would still be as illogical, but there would have been a greater sense of style.  The final result is one part The Eagle Has Landed and two parts Wolfenstein 3D, add in the intelligence level of Con Air and voila!  That's all, folks!  Rambo II is more honest than this.The sound and cinematography also suffer.  Since I revisited The Wild Bunch, Bonnie & Clyde, and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I can state that there is no excuse for such a lack of attention to detail.  The creators could not have made a less-involving movie if they tried.  The producers must have cringed when they previewed this out of its sheer stupidity.  I first saw this when I was nine and laughed at its ridiculousness, now I cringe at its sloppiness.  This lacks more credibility and logic than Kelly's Heroes. 
Overall, I think I made my point as to how awful this is.  Avoid it like malaria, even The Dirty Dozen is better than this.  1 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,14,3 August 2003
The Fly," Cronenberg intentionally insults industry
","There is a tremendous fusion of good and bad here that it took me until now to realize what the fuss was about.  Cronenberg mocks the establishments of the press, science, and television with wicked gusto.This is your only spoiler warning...The first level is Goldblum.  His simple quirkiness isn't anything phenomenal, but it actually suits him the more he decomposes.  Cronenberg treats Goldblum like a diseased relative that is visited on occasion rather than following him.  The decomposing transformation is the horror genre itself, more interested in being stronger and uglier than smarter.  In the end, it is up to the real actor (posing as the real film talent) to destroy the abomination (partial mercy-killing).The second level is the pacing.  Near the end I was disappointed to see a 'TV fadeout' associated with commercial breaks.  'Return of the King' had five of them if I recall correctly.  It's that emphasis on the unreal that makes this interesting.The makeup effects have dated, leaving only some computer displays as eye candy.

I don't even know why IMDb lists this as an 'action' movie, it's not!  Action is films like Desperado, Face/Off, or Terminator, not random people getting shot up.

Total Recall takes the cool, comic book action of RoboCop and mixes it with Arnold's normal 'I will beat you up' attitude.

'Jaws' has held position because all its spin-offs have failed.

Neither of them are well-crafted either as films or 'inspiring stories'.

Eyes Wide Shut," Patient Depth
","Kubrick was possibly our most mature filmmaker in both form and ideas. He proved that story was not necessary in '2001' and 'Barry Lyndon'. His artistic and technical perfectionism is still relevant today (compare the grandeur of spacecraft in '2001' to Lucas' cartoons in 'Episode II') and, despite what anyone will tell you, his stuff is_not_boring.OK, so 'Spartacus' was a bunch of moralistic hoo-ha and 'Shining' was too safe. Big deal. Let's get to the good stuff.Spoiler minefield ahead...Kubrick works in a very contemplative mode. He doesn't have the penchant for editing that those in my 'cinematic excess' category do. In this respect, Kubrick is one of the most personal directors I have experienced. He doesn't create characters by having them spout lines in a cut-and-paste fashion like most directors. He wants them to exist, hence the mountains of laborious takes.Of course, characters themselves are irrelevant in Kubrick's work (again with the '2001' reference). They are about situations and tone. Is it fear? Passion? Insanity? Why do you think his work hits some emotion/psychological bells in our heads? It's not because it's Jack Nicholson.Watch this and notice how Kubrick rewards our patience. You might enjoy it.",8,0,3,19 September 2004

","Pulp Fiction is  a fun film that never takes itself too seriously and has one heck of a time telling its story.  Had it been straightforward, this story is as jumbled as Tarantino's 'Reservoir Dogs', the movie would not have been as strong.

Titanic," Skip It
","Romance movies are not my genre.  There I said it, now all you teenage girls (or ex-teenage girls I should probably say) can come with torches to my house and protest.  That said, I think this movie is not only a dud on the technical level, but also on the content plateu.James Cameron loves creating megadose action flicks (Terminator 2, True Lies, etc.) that usually require little background or very uninvolving plots.  The guy has little to no screenwriting ability (if you read his scripts, particularly for ALIENS, you will see that there is nothing to applaud.  Fortunately, as a director, Cameron can transcend the difficulties of putting images on paper and creating some impressive images (even if the scenes themselves are rather dull).By all means, ABYSS and Terminator 2 deserved Oscars for Cinematography, but this movie is merely overrated end-of-the-year garbage (see also CHICAGO) that lacks emotion and style in his camerawork.  Much of his work here in Titanic seems more like he's stealing ideas from Brian DePalma rather than being inventive.Cameron learned from Corman, plain and simple, and that similar attitude is displayed here.  Grabbing a cast from a fashion catalogue, Cameron proves (once again) that he hasn't lost his touch in how to be EXPLOITIVE of human emotion.  That might explain his love life problems.On the rest of the technical notes, this movie did NOT deserve most of the awards it was nominated for.  The Sound is on par with T2 (read: awful) and the effects were unenlightening.  Someone want to explain how Face/Off didn't get that award?  The visual and SFX were fair.  Fair to poor that is, Cameron has lost his ability to know when to use CGI and when not to. Film editing= totally awful, this was waaayy to long even for me.  Hence I fell asleep three times during the sinking.Music= James Horner's score is nothing new. It rather reminded me of 'The Ten Commandments' and 'Ben-Hur'.  If I had a time machine, I would've given him the Oscar for ALIENS instead.  And as for the Director, what a joke. Now Cameron has become a recluse crackhead rather than therecluse genius he was.So do the math, I have succeeded in knocking off 7 Oscars from this overrated POS.  Now it's on par with Forrest Gump where it belongs. Overall: 1.5 out of 5. Don't waste your time.",Null,3,5,3 May 2003

The Untouchables," Blood, Booze, and Bullets
","I have a weakness for 80s movies, there I said it.  I don't think they are all terrific or great, but there is an interesting mix of story and production values that sets them above movies from 60s and 70s, but they do not have the whiz-bang style of the 90s and onwards.  ALIENS, Back to the Future, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, and Raging Bull included, I love them all. The Untouchables is one of those decidedly 80s movies that hasn't aged quickly--unless you want to count the demise of Kevin Costner's career. Brian DePalma proves here that, while he cannot make a compelling film, he can at least make an entertaining one.  The editing feels jackknifed, especially when some sequences seem out of place.  Nonetheless, it is a superb film that is not for the easily squeamish.Overall, with another terrific score by Ennio Morricone (The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly), and impressive costume and production designs, the Untouchables proves to be well worth its weight in gold.

The Matrix Reloaded," Visuals not helped by lack of editing
","There is a tremendous level of visual grandeur in the 'Matrix Reloaded', so much that it almost parallels the 'Lord of the Rings'. Almost.Unfortunately, it takes nearly half-an-hour into the movie before any real plot is developed that the audience wishes things would kick into gear again.  The first movie relied on initial force and story to draw attention. There were a few bullet-time scenes that made it interesting, but it remained fairly straightforward.In 'Reloaded' there is bullet-time and slow-motion galore.  Too much in fact.  Also, the plot and effects in themselves get to the ridiculously overblown stage by the last 30 minutes.  Pity.  The action itself leaves something to be desired.  After the umpteenth judo battle began, I realized just how annoying it was getting.  The fight on the tractor trailer was just too long for this reviewer's taste.I don't mean to criticize the Wachowski Bros. because they have literally put their heart and soul into these movie, but the editing this time around is just awful.  Even the wondrous sound uses in the first 'Matrix' feel like they've been skimped on this time.Overall, just not as good this time around; a lot like 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' when put in the original context.  3 out of 5.",Null,2,4,22 May 2003

I've found that watching this in late April is more rewarding than mid December.This is your only spoiler warning...That notion aside, I feared revisiting this movie because, like so many other films from this decade, I was worried it would show its age and thus kill itself in the process--fulfilling Bailey's wish.Amazingly, that isn't the case.  This is sentimentality done right in the vein of 'The Elephant Man'.  Why?  The frame of the story; for that reason you should see it and get some tears in the process. First we have the setting of the world where Steward lives.  Then there is Heaven.  All our exposition of Stewart's world comes as a story being told to Clarence.  Meanwhile, we--the audience--are tricked into accepting Stewart's life as reality until Capra slaps us upside the head and tells us 'I'm not even started yet!'When we finally do get to the plot, we have Clarence as our navigator.  From God to the Angel.  This is when George sees how the world would be without his influence.Overall, skip 'Terminator' for your need to study the importance of one life.

Enemy at the Gates," Hooked and Gutted
","Enemy at the Gates is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The plot, essential in a movie of this nature, lacks enough credibility that the whole mess resembles only a beefed-up version of 'Combat'.  It is simply another CGI-enhanced war flick trying to cash in on the success of Saving Private Ryan, end of debate.The cinematography is horrendous and the music is even worse.  Due to modern technology, not only are today's directors able to recreate such garish details as severed limbs and WW2 vintage bombers, but they also can eliminate any shred of intelligence in the script and hire a terrible cast. Vassili's rise to fame resembles Jerry Maguire more than Platoon.  Even Bob Hoskins, the most talented of the cast, is wasted in his role as Nikita Khruschev.The first half-hour alone has no redeeming quality that makes this movie stand out as anything significant.  The remaining 90 minutes only emphasizes that point.  If the Soviets had as many morons in their military as this movie would suggest, it's a miracle that they survived World War II.Overall, skip this movie altogether.  There is nothing else I can say.

Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Cinematic Souls, Borrowed Beings
","Interesting paradox. I admire British filmmakers (Scott, Watkin, Unsworth, Biddle), but when mixed with incompetent American supervisors--like here--we get a mess.Something like a spoiler warning...The dominant problem from the first movie is two artless Americans--Columbus and Kloves.  The translation from the books is so literal that no cinematic soul is created.  Compare this to Jackson's 'Lord' series to see where someone tries creating a cinematic soul (yet plagues it with other problems) and then 'Catch-22.'  There a completely separate soul is created, but it is rejected because it doesn't have every nuance of the book.  Why do we keep cutting Jackson slack for work that plagiarize other works, cinematically speaking?As with the 'Alien' series, we have a formula where different elements are highlighted.  Thankfully, Cuaron changed our emphasis from literal to cinematic.  Since this is totally reliant on the script, our actors aren't important.  Pity since this was Harris' swan song.The second problem rests in Columbus' handling of the material.  He is constantly warring between being two people: Robert Altman and Steven Spielberg.  Granted, I don't credit Altman with being more than an insufferable loudmouth, but he is at least more stimulating than thoughtless Columbus.--The whole 'Class War' subplot is totally juvenile, as is the Celebrity/Society stance.  Altman had already covered this ground without being so ham-handed in 'Gosford'.  Columbus does it in the whole 'smack-me-upside-the-head' fashion from 'Mockingbird.'--Columbus becomes Spielberg when it comes to his images.  He repeatedly steals from 'E.T.', 'Gremlins', 'Back to the Future', 'Jurassic Park', and 'Indiana Jones'.  Williams caught on to this 'me-too'-ism, so he recycles his score from 'Last Crusade.'  Even the color scheme is tasteless.Comments that this is 'darker' are hilarious.  Darkness doesn't come by throwing in moody music, blood, bigger monsters, or diabolical plans.  If the ending is somber and the hero is humbled, that is far darker than a thousand monsters.  That's the difference between filmic stimulation and simple amazement.  Columbus just takes the images that amazed us before and turns them into spiders and snakes, he obviously didn't learn from 'Empire Strikes Back.'Speaking of which, something to be said for the effects.  This is so sloppy and artificial that any child can see through it.  We go from Draco to Gollum with Dobby and Jar Jar thrown in the mix.  Not a good track record for CGI characters.  Of course, they follow the Disney character design philosophy--another area where Disney stunted hurt our imaginations.
However, all is not lost.  We get some nice Dutch-tilted wall shots reminiscent of '12 Monkeys' (also Pratt).  My dream for the series?  Make Attenborough the new Dumbledore, hand directing reigns to Branagh, have Goldsmith do the score, and get Alex Thomson as photographer.

Psycho," I'm not going to waste time writing this review
","There are movies that require a lot of thinking as to why they are great, then there are movies that are great because they are multi-layered yet complex on each layer.Psycho is one such example.  Hitchcock is marvelous in his manipulation of both the audience and the picture.  To think this was robbed at the Oscar! Bernard Hermann, one of the greatest composers ever, proves his strength with total vigor.  It is all to obvious why Hitch kept relying on him.Simply put, this is required viewing to anyone.  If it makes you want to take a shower again (I doubt it will cause any phobias of that)...so be it. Nonetheless, an important film that isn't afraid to be detailed with some pretty deep and disturbing material.  I will take it over a billion Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street sequels any day, any time.  No one will be able to match Anthony Perkins' eccentric mannerisms, not in a thousand years.  Kudos to Hitch for casting him.Overall, if there was one flaw I felt with this movie, it was that the shrink at the end did to much explaining to the audience and didn't allow Hitch to create something on his own that would have done the same job more effectively.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",10,0,1,20 August 2003

However, just about every woman I know who has seen this has had nightmares from it.  Oh, well, their loss. 'The Omen' did a far better job of being both creepy and shocking. Nonetheless, for those looking for so-called classic horror, go ahead and waste your time with this.  If you want REAL TERROR, go to back to Jaws.Overall, 2 out of 5 stars.

Hercules," Machine within the god
","I laugh when I read most of the reviews here because they are so concerned about accuracy to story.  As any real film viewer knows, movies aren't about story or the intricateness of the plot.  They help, but aren't necessary.This gets the dubious honor of being the most interesting of Disney's Phase III releases.  I'm not saying it's worth watching, but you should notice a few ironies if you do.Disney has, since the start, found something where they invest themselves in their work.  In 'Beauty and the Beast' it was in Belle.  In 'Pocahantas' it was in the 'New World' concept.  They also find interesting ways of skewing perspectives (e.g. in 'Dumbo' the elephants are both the Axis powers and the Republicans.  One symbol is obvious, the other isn't).  Here it is not a character or a place, but an idea.  Consider:--The modernization of Hercules with the endorsement machine.  Not since 'Dumbo' have we seen a similar portrayal.  Disney flaunts the very process that makes their marketing campaigns so huge.  Since 'Little Mermaid', Disney has relied on flooding the market with hyperhype (is that a word?) to guarantee success.--Gerald Scarfe as designer.  I would have loved to see Scarfe's original ideas implemented since he knows about mix of real and cartoon in his art. Too bad that many of his ideas fell victim to Disney's 'cutesy' machine.  It would be great seeing an animated version of this reminiscent to his art in 'Pink Floyd'.--James Woods.  One of our best characters actors left, is it any wonder that Disney chose him?  Dreamworks felt threatened by this talent so they grabbed as many 'high name' starts as they could for their equally mythical 'Prince of Egypt'.

All Quiet on the Western Front," Milestone
","When I was waiting in line at my local 7-11 the other day, I mentally made a list of the so-called 'great war movies.'  Such prominent names as Apocalypse Now, Patton, and Blackhawk Down passed through my mind, but I couldn't decide.  Many directors have tried war films, Wolfgang Petersen was phenomenal with Das Boot, but has fallen into a Hollywood money pit.  Ridley Scott barely avoided the claws of Jerry Bruckheimer.  Oliver Stone hasn't changed in 20 years, but he served before making his attempt, I will give him credit for that.  Stanley Kubrick wants to understand, but his war films never excelled as to the purpose, Paths of Glory came closest compared to his narrative failure of Full Metal Jacket.  Then I remembered Lewis Milestone...my first experience with Milestone's work came when I was 11 with Pork Chop Hill.  That movie changed every way I look at war along with A Bridge Too Far.  Before Kubrick, Kurosawa, and even Hitchcock got off the ground, Milestone holds my honor as being the original cinematic genius.  All Quiet on the Western Front is everything that Terrence Malick wanted to do in The Thin Red Line.  Malick must not have seen this because he just tries elaborating on it.  He failed because he doesn't understand the audience anymore than the topic.  AQWF presents an image of the novel that defines everything in a war movie. Many films like Platoon, Saving Private Ryan, and Windtalkers have tried to repeat the same message, none as successful.'Rejoice o young man in thy youth.'  That phrase from the beginning of Platoon sums up the movie as the German boys leave school for enlistment.  I find it interesting in the first few minutes how Milestone enters the thoughts of each student in all their delusions.  That is genius.Even stronger is how Milestone manipulates the camera during the war.  The synchronizing of the machine guns to waves of Frenchmen getting riddled resembles the bunker shots of 'Private Ryan.  Spielberg and Kaminiski obviously studied this many times before filming their epic.  The camera is all about movement at war, perhaps to emphasize the fact that the soldiers can't go anywhere but die.The subtle signs of power and intelligence on Milestone's part are sprinkled throughout, from the slowly dying Frenchman in the shell crater to the butterfly ending.  This is a hallmark of filmmaking that will never be equaled.  The camera, the ear, the cast, the editing...everything is perfect.Overall, the greatest war movie ever made.  Period.  5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,5,17 August 2003
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Botched Medium
","I am kicking myself for being so unobservant.  Films, books, and plays are three different art forms and 'Cuckoo's Nest' has the (mis)fortune of existing in all three stages.  None are good examples of their respective forms.Books are plot-driven, requiring the right mix of story with dialog. Actually, dialog isn't necessary to make a popular book as Tom Clancy and John Grisham have demonstrated.Films are visually-driven.  When a film relies too much on the mechanics of books, they fail.  Why have the Clancy and Grisham adaptations faded so quickly?  Because the directors start with a story and then try to visualize it as best as they can while cutting out the guts of the book (the plot)...probably why the #1 comment is 'the book was better'.  Thus a good film, in the visual sense, needs little dialog and even bad dialog can work. Ang Lee, Ridley Scott, and Stanley Kubrick proved that.  These three start with visuals then use plot as an excuse for the vision, that's how they get away with clichés.Plays are entirely dialog-driven, requiring mastery of language to create and perform.  What works in books and films can fail because we take out the scene imagination of the audience in exchange for verbal imagination.  The two don't mix.Well, 'Cuckoo's Nest' (book, play, and film) is nothing unique.  Remember that Kesey wrote his book after Heller's 'Catch-22' and the film adaptation likewise followed Nichols' better attempt.  We can see that if Heller hadn't succeeded this would never have been made.  No one would have been interested in another examination of insanity, but this doesn't even have the clever manipulation of either the narrator or language.In this particular case, the failure falls on Forman.  Dialog and acting are pointless in this medium, especially Nicholson since his 'method acting' here is no different than the Joker.  Another problem is the emotionless images.  This isn't the calculated coldness of Kubrick, just sloppy filmmaking.  Perhaps this should not have been attempted at all...My advice, compare this to that year's 'Barry Lyndon' to understand when adaptations take advantage of the different mediums.  The problem with America is that we make everyone verbally literate and then expect them to go to movies with the same mentality.  If we raise future generations to be visually literate then this movie would disappear.  That's our dilemma: Hollywood vs. Education.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud",1,21,93,19 March 2004
Army of Darkness," It'll Swallow Your Soul
","I loathe mindless entertainment junkies because they are more concerned about letting their collective brain cells deteriorate rather than do some critical analysis.Why is Sam Raimi great?  Because he invests everything into the camera and its movement and nothing else.  Perhaps effects are the only thing that come after the cinematography.  That said, Army of Darkness concludes his 'Evil' frame of mind.Whereas ED2 parodies the horror cliches of the 70s and 80s and insults the pop genre surrounding them, 'Army' tries to create its own pop influence. Needless to say, it's all too obvious in our culture now.  It is more coherent and slicker than its predecessor, but there's something wrong.  ED2 felt experimental and out-of-control, where anything possible could (and often did) happen.  Here it feels too formulaic, too mainstream.  As with the predecessor, we see more of the same with an even bigger emphasis on comedy.I consider this Raimi's third best movie.  It is better than ED1, Darkman, Spider-Man, and the Gift, but still has some lacking qualities in the bizarre department compared to ED2 and the Quick and the Dead.  When it comes down to a challenge between Raimi and Tim Burton, though, I'll stay with Raimi.Overall, despite being destructive to the social thought world, Army of Darkness is more referencing and appealing to the adolescents.  2.5 out of 5.",Null,0,2,1 November 2003
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Typical Action Movie
","Die Hard with a Vengeance is both an insult to John McTiernan and Bruce Willis.  Willis never has been a varied actor, all he's been doing is playing different versions of John McClane ever since the original Die Hard. Here he's a shell of his former self.What made the original so fun is that it mixed adrenaline with a (better than average sense of realism).  Vengeance winds up being a typical action movie, offering nothing new to the audience and certainly inferior to the scope of Die Hard.  Samuel Jackson creates another 'tough guy' role that allows him to speak his mind, but under some pretty PC constraints.On the technical level this movie stinks.  Did they not have enough money in their $90 million budget to hire a steadicam operator?  I won't even get started on the editing...Overall, I can't disagree with how they made this movie any further.  You really don't need to see it to appreciate the first and action fans should look for something a little more intelligent because Aliens and The Terminator are better than this.  1 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,5,14 August 2003
Con Air," Bruckheimer the enslaver
","As if my summary didn't say enough.  This movie is about as exploitive and stupid as a summer action movie can get.  By using mult-ethnicity, the makers only reveal their own bigotry.  Let's see:We have the black revolutionary complete with dogma and his own 'gangsta style'.  There is the tamer counterpart to balance out any negative effects the former may have, of course.We have the hispanic rapist, sure to be popular with the kids.We have the everyday white serial killers and mass-murders complete with degrees in insanity and lunacy.And, to make things worse, we have Nicolas Cage wasted on a repeat of his role in Raising Arizona.  Whoever thought giving him a southern accent was a bright idea needs to be dropped from 20,000 feet onto a parked Volvo.  John Malkovich, wasted on a role as the dominant predator, shows he is as empty-headed as the script.  He was better in Empire of the Sun.Obviously, a movie of this nature devotes more time and money into making sure the pyrotechnicians don't accidentally kill everyone than the script. If you are a fan of Bruckheimer's work, or if you liked Tomb Raider, then this is for you.  Otherwise, forget it.  The boneyard battle shows--in full glory--where the money went more than any other scene.Overall, so dense you need a chainsaw to get through it, this is predictable entertainment. 1.5 out of 5 stars.

Jaws," I will never swim again
","OK, Jaws is undoubtedly one of Spielberg's five best films. Expert cinematography, well-chosen cast, and John William's infamous ominous score make this a feature you'll find either hokey or horrifying. I found it the latter.  Roy Scheider is excellent as police chief/father and no one can possible replace Robert Shaw as Quint.  All his mannerisms and actions seem 100% suited for a grizzled shark hunter like him.  Probably some of the most gruesome deaths ever on celluloid.  Watch this and never swim again.",10,1,2,24 August 2002
The Lion King," I liked this movie...for the first minute
","The Lion King starts with the best work by Disney.  Not since Bambi have I seen an attention to detail in the lifelike attitude of nature.  Hans Zimmer's music in the opening is very traditional and lends a strong edge, until the English lyrics for 'Circle of Life' kick in and I grabbed my ears in disgust.  From then on, it's all downhill.  What starts as a beautiful documentary winds up another typical Disney movie in the fashion of The Little Mermaid.  O, how I miss the inventive days of Dragonslayer.If the 'music video' aspects of this (made, no doubt, to suit the tykes brought in by their weekend parents) had been chopped, as had most of the cornball dialog, this would have been a very powerful version of Hamlet. Instead we get a load of Disney cartoon colors splashed about like a Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse short and some really terrible songs.  The artistry level of the opening only returns once more during the stampede, but even then it is ruined by the mood.Notice the subtext of female subordination that Disney includes here.  This is certainly not in the same league as Ridley Scott or James Cameron, but is shocking enough since this isn't quite the same as Aladdin.  I should add that this has to be the best animated Disney feature since The Rescuers Down Under, not like that means anything.Overall, I was disappointed by this rendition.  Ever since this movie, Disney has turned to Pixar for the animating skill.  Thankfully, that means no more godawful songs we the audience have to sit through.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,1,3 September 2003
Platoon," Not pleasant (is war ever?)
","Vietnam, to most other countries, probably has the same meaning as 'nostril' and 'book'--pointless.  But here in America, it is a very sensitive issue that even today is hard to bring up and still be far in opinion without sounding bias or snobbish. 'Platoon' takes the uncomfortable situation of being in a foreign, hostile country with comrades who can be as psychotic as the enemy and weighing that on your conscience for two hours.  It isn't a film where you can sit back, relax, and watch the fireworks.  You must use your mind to consider the situations of the unit and 'think with them' to a degree. The first half, set in 1967, takes us into the war only two years old and rapidly gaining unpopularity at home. By the end, 1968, we come face to face with battle in a fashion not jingoistic like John Wayne or gritty like Saving Private Ryan, but rather a punch in the gut that doesn't try and give you $100 million explosions and brand-name actors looking clean and cocky. In all fairness, they are ugly, tired, and their mixed emotions of the growing conflict they're embroiled in is eating away at them faster than the leeches. I praise Oliver Stone for not putting 'glory' in the public sense of it into the film and presenting just how hellish, up-close-and-personal, and unforgiving war can be.  I guess only by serving yourself can you truly understand what it's like.",10,1,2,21 July 2002
Paths of Glory," Elaboration
","While Paths of Glory is certainly one of Kubrick's best (it certainly ranks above The Shining and Full Metal Jacket), it is only an elaboration on the darker aspects of Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front.  Such concepts as cowardice, insubordination, and prejudice are thrown in to keep things different, but Kubrick can't help hiding that fact.Kirk Douglas never was a particularly varied or useful actor (Michael Douglas only continued that tradition) and here he is his usual maniacal self, only now we are supposed to sympathize with him.  Talk about the impossible.The camera is not as declarative as AQWF, but Kubrick takes some personal notes and tries to be one better through 'artistry'.  That doesn't quite cut it.Overall, watchable understanding of war's insanity.  Better than MASH and most other examples, on the level of Catch-22.  4 out of 5 stars.",6,1,4,27 August 2003
Back to the Future Part II," Rolling down a hill
","Back to the Future Part II starts with a lot of promise (and by that I don't mean flying through the clouds with the credits in a manner reminiscent of the beginning of Lea Thompson's earlier film Red Dawn).  The first 50 minutes are simultaneously enjoyable and thought-provoking, but, as is the case with most sequels, the interesting elements of the original, the script, is skimped on in order to appeal to money.*Spoiler Start* Going to the 'near-future' (2015 is closer now than 1985) was interesting, if hokey, but I found its vision of being nonstop gags to get tiresome. Let's face it Blade Runner will probably remain the dominant future in all its darkened neon glory.The return to the Alternate 1985 starts interesting, but things start going downhill when the plot gets in the way.  Zemeckis wanted something dark, but winds up sugarcoating it like he did with the more disturbing segments of Forrest Gump.Returning further to 1955 was a completely out of line and caused the timeline to get so distorted that I threw down my pad and pen that I was taking notes with and snorted in disgust.  That segment was the biggest rash on the script.Worst of all, the end brings us to the lowest installment in the trilogy. My oh my, how things could have been simpler. *Spoiler End*Nonetheless, I found this film more worthwhile than other sequels I've had to see.  Christopher Lloyd saves the day with his almost-typecast acting as Dr. Brown again.  Everyone else, even Michael Fox, winds up being a cardboard prop-up merely spouting words.  The depth of the original was gone.  Zemeckis gets away from his Roger Rabbit shenanigans and creates something unique albeit confusing, but his camera is always looking for the 'money shot'.Overall, an interesting but flawed movie.  Zemeckis would make some improvements with Forrest Gump and Death Becomes Her, but, other than that, he too is on the downhill slide.  3 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,0,27 July 2003
The Silence of the Lambs," Hannibal Lecter's America
","The subtext of Silence of the Lambs is phenomenal considering it is the work of Jonathan Demme.  He is not a creative person, but it is a blessing that this movie lacks any subtle directorial touches.  The focus is on the actors, not the circumstances.  This is evident in Howard Shore's score, a mix of the conventional horror movie and the old school thriller.  It is not particularly pompous, but it doesn't need to be.Jodie Foster attempts to be deep, if it weren't for Demme's camera she would be nothing more than a decoration.  Her accent is just a distraction from her actions, by golly I hated it.Anthony Hopkins is the dominant feature of the entire film.  More than him, it is his character.  Hannibal is certainly one of the 10 deepest characters ever created for film, he has superseded Hopkins himself.  Notice how the camera loves Hannibal and he loves it back.  Hopkins will never be better despite recent efforts to eclipse his role.  Hollywood has tried cashing in on Hannibal Lecter's persona, but never understanding the context enough. Gore doesn't substitute for script.  The final parody, of course, is the way Demme presents America as either a victim or something hidden in a closet.  The apparition never gets to see the light of day because it is constantly being snuffed out at night by the forces of evil.  Maybe he was being prophetic in his primitive mind.Given the documentary style of the film, it is interesting how much attention is given to Jame Gumb.  Had he been absent more often, I'm certain it would've helped the suspense, but one must wonder ahead of time where the story is going.  We can guess what Clarice is going to do ahead of time, but what about Hannibal?  That is the fault of the editors, but Silence of the Lambs is certainly better edited than Batman or Empire of the Sun.  It is gruesome, not for titillation in the fashion of Friday the 13th. Rather, it is present for the sense of realism.  Might I add that this is one of the most disturbingly dark movies ever made.Overall, a well-deserving winner of Best Picture (for once I agree with the accursed Academy of fools) that stands out in its genre.  Horror will never be the same.  I would have preferred if Foster didn't have that nagging accent, but that's a small price to pay for a lack of a message in the film. Geometrically superior to its so-called 'sequels'.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",10,1,1,6 August 2003
Any Given Sunday," Habit of Vomit
","Wants 'Raging Bull', gets 'Natural Born Killers'This is your only spoiler warning...I'll be honest here.  Stone knows a few things about dialog that his successors don't.  He's also proved himself a master of first-level narratives ('Born on the Fourth', 'Platoon') and even the second-level ('JFK'--where the film was_about_a film), but I think he's exhausted his cinematic juices.  What we have is this...pretty depressing, ain't it?Stone wants the 'Rollerball' concept of athletes-as-warriors, yet he insists on depicting the characters as people.  Gladiator battles are focused on the movement and fluidity of combat, not single faces.  Stone falls victim, again, to the same 'commercial method' that he's satirizing, and we're stuck with Jamie Foxx's mug plastered onscreen.I think, since 'JFK', Stone has been caught in a kind of visual angst.  He isn't certain what he wants to see, so he throws every camera angle into his soup and prays for a miracle.  It worked in 'JFK' in capturing the essence of the Kennedy conspiracy, here it just makes us think he's ADD.  Compare this with Ridley Scott or even Steven Spielberg--who KNOW what they want to see.Oh, yes, and there's his trademark misogyny.Fortunately, all is not lost.  Stone has three kinds of actors: real actors (here presented by James Woods), prop actors (LL Cool J), and dynamite sticks (Al Pacino).  It seems in each of his projects he gets one of each. Furthermore, these characters are actors in the barest sense.  They live and perform on camera.  Stone even injects himself into the story as one of the narrators (also, I might add, the most worthless job in the profession).Also, Stone works to create a universe (in this case a whole football league) since the Sport Nazis at the NFL wouldn't let him use their franchises.  Sadly, despite this opportunity, Stone becomes more derivative rather than more original.Still, I'll take this over any 'feel good' Disney sport junk--the most recent being 'Miracle'.",Null,0,1,20 July 2004
Tombstone," Typical
","Coming from the director of Rambo and Cobra, it's obvious that Tombstone isn't trying to make new boundaries of the genre.  However, when a movie fails to be basic entertainment, then you know something is wrong.Excess is the name of the game in Tombstone.  Too many players, too many scenes, too many fool's pardons on the writer (who also wrote The Mummy and Rambo, go fig).  Kurt Russell is not his usual Escape from New York self, he is totally anti-Carpentar in his depiction of Wyatt Earp.  That's not very good either.  Watch Bill Paxton carefully, you can always guess what he's going to say next.Overall, only Val Kilmer and his self-assured swagger make the only worthwhile element here.

Blade Runner," Death-Wish
","I have a deep respect for Ridley Scott.  Even though his more recent works haven't been up to snuff, I admire him because, unlike other noted directors like Steven Spielberg, he takes the time to provide a commentary on his DVDs.  Even for ALIEN he managed to create an interesting side-view to the action.  John Frankenheimer also tried, but since he's gone we will never hear from him again.  How sad...Blade Runner is phenomenal in writing, artistry, and casting.  In truth, the movie is probably a production designer's worst nightmare.  For the record, any and all references I make to the movie are towards the infinitely superior Director's Cut.  The visuals are dark and dazzling, creating images that are nowadays the definitive look of the future.  Minority Report wishes it were this good.But all flash and no show would take this movie very low.  Thankfully, Harrison Ford proves he can be emotional and not a cynical, swaggering comic book character.  It's too bad Rutger Hauer never went on to anything better, but he's too limited as an actor.  Other than hate and empathy, he never gets any emotions out.  The rest of the cast is perfect for their obscure, crazy roles.The human (or non-human) factors of Blade Runner are what sets it apart from other films in the genre and raises it to the level of 2001: A Space Odyssey and Dr. Strangelove.  While I am not as familiar with noir as I'd like to admit, Blade Runner also emits its own distinctive mood that is undeniable. It's too bad that Scott has fallen into a commercial pit that he is trying to claw his way out of.Overall, an amazing film that should be required viewing by all sci-fi and humanitarian fans.  The depth and breath of this 'futuristic detective flick' ranges from an obviously classical inspiration to the modern view of mortality and machinery.

Signs," Frames of Evil
","So many different styles have been applied to making CRT reflections.  The most intelligent form I've seen is in 'WarGames': Broderick is reflected on his computer, which is later reflected on its creator.  Every other film uses it in the simple 'reflected on face' technique.This is your only spoiler warning...Here the director tries the opposite method, reflecting our alien enemy on the TV.  The juxtaposition couldn't be any more obvious.  Our new Spielberg does the 'Poltergeist' thing.There are other frames, psychological and physical.  The story is a frame passed down from the 'Living Dead' and 'Halloween' movies.  Communication is framed by the TV screen (again with the 'Poltergeist').  Even the initial footage of the invaders is based on TV/video legend.If Shyamalan continued to make this point, we would've had something interesting.  Unfortunately, he's trying the 'Spielberg emotion' context. That's bad for our culture.  Third times not a charm for him and I doubt the promise of 'The Village'.When we get some better understanding of Americana, then we'll have something interesting to watch.

Speed," Not as smart as you'd think...
","While Speed could have been a great thriller (it certainly is better than James Cameron's overdose of budget with True Lies), but it falls into the category where entertaining the audience supersedes credibility.  It's worth seeing once though I can't bring myself to recommend movies with Keanu Reeves in them.Dennis Hopper is his usual mad self, it would be interesting to see him as a second-grade teacher in a movie.  I can say that the passengers on the bus are not smart on the writer's part.  Given that this is by Graham Yost, the same guy who wrote Broken Arrow, I'm not surprised.  I was happy with Alan Ruck's performance.  He has changed a lot since being Cameron Frye. 
Jan de Bont isn't a strong director.  What works for him is the usual facade of MTV-style images.  I will admit he is a little beyond that level, but not by much.  Considering he worked with such directors as Paul Verhoeven, Richard Donner, John McTiernan, and Ridley Scott, this is a disappointment. Speed 2 and Lara Croft 2 have reinforced my view of him.Overall, there are better action movies out there, but there are a lot worse ones too.  2 out of 5 stars.",Null,1,2,18 August 2003
Amélie," Introverted, Meditated Investment
","Spoiler warning...Films, the best films, tend to use three rules as a frame.1.  The relationship between the film and the audience.  This can be as simple as 'breaking the fourth wall' or making a social commentary, usually the more subtle or outlandish the better.  This is why 'Wizards' sits higher on my list of films than 'MASH'.2.  The relationship between different ingredients (plot elements, photography, sound, etc.)  'Catch-22', 'Moulin Rouge!', and 'Eraserhead' are good examples.3.  The existence of the world outside what's onscreen.  'Lola Rennt' and 'Fight Club' understood this real well.This film takes the rules and puts them in a new context; not the war film, or the action film, or the comedy, but the romance.  In other words, ignore the plot.Jean-Pierre Jeunet sits higher on my directors list than, say, mind-numbing stylists like Tony Scott.  Even 'Alien 4' is interesting when understood in the right context.  Jeunet operates by taking a story frame and expanding on it.  Not with plot, but with visuals.  Look at when Amelie is photographing the clouds.  How would Spielberg have handled that?Spielberg, Howard, Zwick, and Bay are all action men.  They pride themselves on 'doing things': telling stories.  Jeunet operates by observing.  He is Amelie watching the bar patrons squabble amongst themselves.  This observer philosophy is carried on in the movie by Amelie talking to us about going to the movies and watching other people's reactions (I do that at the theatre, it helps enrich the experience)Meanwhile, Jeunet has his eye on other things (literally).  He and David Fincher are probably the two biggest users of what I now call the 'New Color' method.  Dozens of films have copied it whether they're the 'Matrix' films or 'Lord of the Rings', even 'Hellboy'.  What else makes this unique and/or interesting for our culture?--The 'screw Princess Di' motif.  Who should waste their time caring for 'celebs' anyway?--Yet another brick in the wall for the glorious American evil known as the MPAA.  Consider, this was 'R' while the empty, toxic 'Fast and Furious' was given a kiddie-friendly rating.  What's next?  Jerry Springer gets a 'G'? This is also another nice slap in the face to Cannes (especially now that redneck Michael Moore won).--The gliding camera contrasting with the James Stewart-style voyeur.  Here we have the mixing of styles.  The glider is Jeunet's vision in action.  The voyeur is stagnant, much like the 'men of action' I mentioned earlier.  How ironic...--Notice how we are invested in the lives of others besides Amelie, both important to the story and not.  Just examine how the suicide jumper is revealed.  That's the world for you...--The audio philosophy this time is 'Delicatessen' meets 'Eraserhead'.  The best of 2001 in my book.All this film needed was more exposure, since we Americans are deprived of foreign film thanks to Hollywood, to be a complete classic.  Now, due to French relations, that may never happen.Final Analysis = = Learn from this...",3,6,14,24 June 2004

","Spoiler minefield...Between Hitchcock and Rod Serling, our culture has lost something.  I admit it, when I was young I tried watching every 'Twilight Zone' episode and learned something that some modern Hollywood writers still haven't caught on to.I hate obvious twists like this movie because it is totally unimaginative. The premise is simple: a 2 hour film about a boy who sees dead people.  Make us sit through said film and experience Osment's unbearable acting and silly shock scenes.Then in the end, poke us in the eye and say 'Ha ha, it was all a farce. Bruce Willis was really dead all along.'  As if a thousand episodes of what Rod Serling wrote 50 years ago hasn't prepared us for that.If the film provides its twists earlier enough to have fun with them ('Fight Club') or leaves itself open for new twists ('The Wall', 'Usual Suspects') I can have some fun with it.  Instead, Shyamalan wants to be Spielberg and have everything open-and-shut but the material demands otherwise.So, Willis is dead and that's the end of it.  Case closed, he ceases to exist.

This is your only spoiler warning...The world here is skewered, much like 'Truman Show'.  Whereas Weir wanted reality in disguise, this is plain reality looking fake.  Varying detail is spread over everything, causing the effect to less look authentic than 'West Side Story'.  This almost resembles 'Streetcar'.Here is where Hitchcock separates the film world from the stage world.  This movie is only a freak mutation of both that uses Stewart as the stationary viewer.  We watch Stewart.  We know Stewart has a flat persona that's been continuously belted since 'Mr. Smith'.The plot is ridiculously simple by today's standards and the photography is lethargic, but Hitchcock has another element...Kelly.

The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," Decline of Substance
","This is your only spoiler warning...What made the first two interesting was how they imitated a minimum of sources.  Here, all sorts of minor elements are borrowed from...guess what? The 'Star Wars' trilogy.  The elephant charge is from 'Empire'.  Troll design comes from the Rancor.  The concept of 'distorted fathers' is obvious.  The romance is from the original 'Star Wars'.  Heck, they even throw in the funeral pyre from 'Jedi'!   Outside of Lucas' concoction, there are other lesser elements that are liberally stolen from.  The siege is shot like 'Starship Troopers' as is Nazgul's death.  Eowyn kills the Ringwraith like 'Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.  The catapult POV is from 'Army of Darkness'.  The breed of pleasant music and slow-motion threat?  'Face/Off'Even without looking into other films in the world, there is so much internal referencing that this movie isn't anything new.  More elephants, bigger armies, bigger fortresses, another giant monster, it's that simple. The designs here are the weakest of the trilogy, even the makeup and effects aren't impressive anymore.  Sound design has degraded to B-movie levels.The characterizations are less advanced this time.  Gimli and Legolas are once again comic-relief.  They haven't had anything to do since 'Fellowship'.  Similarly, Arwen is given more though she wasn't needed in 'Towers' while Blanchett, the best actor in the bunch, is pointlessly used here.Even worse is the level of gloss thrown on everything, something we've been seeing since 'Pearl Harbor'.  The gloss will date this series in the same way that we see 'Taxi Driver' as amateurish today.  While violence in 'Fellowship' was raw, here it is blurred out either by shaky camera or choppy editing.

A Nightmare on Elm Street," Cheap Thrills
","The Concept:  'Invasion of the Body Snatchers' meets 'Terminator' meets 'Carrie'It's hilarious watching these 'horror' films--we know the cliches by heart, but gladly accept more.  The acting is daft (even Englund's) but I saw this with 'Fast Times' because some of their players later went through the 'Oliver Stone Camp.'  In this case, Depp (with Whitaker) in 'Platoon.'  This is Depp's first work, but he's superior to everyone on the playing field.This is your only spoiler warning...The production values are definitely 'Highlander', even the photography borrows similar lighting and angles.  By today's standards, the energy has evaporated because Craven invests all of it into the score...and the score is unbearably thin.  David Fincher mastered the shot, chop, and idea with his projects.By comparison to the shallow 'Halloween' and 'Friday the 13th' garbage, this actually has better points.  Kruger is the Martin Riggs of the genre, except here where he's the one-dimensional bogeyman.  He'd later add the human element; outclassing the foolish actors (and directors) that didn't understand it. Some interesting notes:--The whole premise, 'Halloween' with 'Alice', was later expanded in 'Matrix'.  The hero, by modern standards, is a prude.  Just goes to show how this has dated in 20 years.--Craven retains his hypocrisy from 'Hills.'  Here he takes from 'Exorcist', 'Psycho', 'Caligari', and 'Evil Dead.'  Ironically, Raimi would bring a new vocabulary to the genre with 'Dead 2' and 'Army.'  Still, Craven is slightly smarter than Carpentar.--Kruger bleeds anti-freeze.  He resides in an industrial lair.  His weapon of choice, naturally, is his razor glove.  Being possessed by the machine fetish, he kills kids.

A few 80s movies tried this after 'Back to the Future', none lasted because they didn't understand the context.Here we have two Biffs and no Doc to run the show.  The historical figures themselves aren't interesting because they rely on the stereotypes we have in our minds.  'Kid in King Arthur's Court' also had these problems.  There was so much potential here, so why did it fail?I found the sequel more interesting because it explored the darker philosophical territory of life, death, etc. rather than simple textbook journeys like this.  There was also the heavy duality motif that's absent here.There are some good points like the self-referential Incest Joke.  The writers improved on this the second time around, but it's pretty deep stuff for a light movie.  Also, there's the irony of Keanu.  From airhead to Messiah, that's society in a nutshell.The music, vocabulary, and production design are throwaways.  Fortunately, the writers had another chance with better crew to set things straight--and to Hell, literally, with nostalgia.I liked sequel self-reference of 'Bogus Journey' to the history-bashing here.

Unlike things like JAWS and Indiana Jones, it ages better than other films and retains its sense of 'coolness' after all these years. Ok, to be honest, the last two films so far have sucked, let's hope Lucas gets it right with 'Attack of the Fools'. Come what may--no pun intended--I don't think we'll see Episodes 7, 8, and 9. Apparently we'll have to make due with the 99 cent novels for that excitement.",1,8,46,24 April 2002
Ran," Distance
","Anime has yet to get this good.  Ran is so much more concerned with all the tiny details that anime skips on that I can't help but be amazed with Kurosawa, not so much his prowess, but his commitment.  Kurosawa's eye is both poignant yet far away, creating a feeling one-half stage play, one half 60s movie.  He avoids close-ups and prefers the lavish grandeur associated with his paintings.  In most aspects, this works.In actuality, I am more in favor of his exposition scenes and less concerned with his depiction of war.  I am sick of battle scenes, have seen enough of them in movies to last me a lifetime and very few have been any good.  While Kurosawa is keen to use a flurry of images to create a sense of confusion and motion, the editing and music do not lend appropriate moods.  Had he gone for more detailed one-on-one shots, the kind John Woo loves to cram in his gunfights, I would have better things to say.  The inclusion of nature throughout is more sophisticated than The Thin Red Line, kudos.Sound and text are two areas that take the biggest beating.  In the first battle, the music drowns everything out and creates no atmosphere in itself. In the second one, the cacophony of gunfire, not to mention the repetition of horsemen getting shot, boils everything down to monotony.  If modern effects technicians touched this up on par with The Wild Bunch, it would be worth your ears.  As others have said, the script is no match for Shakespearean dialog, but I find the plot to be more refined and stimulating compared to the original King Lear.  No more eurocentric biases.Overall, this is a brilliant Kurosawa film more than worth watching. Perhaps he and Kubrick were the only 80s directors to really understand what auteur theory was.

Apollo 13," 'Right Stuff' for women
","That's right, Apollo 13 is merely a 'Reader's Digest' version of The Right Stuff.  Shorter, lacking the same energy, and relying on style over substance.  Tom Hanks and the rest of the cast are better-than-average, but some, particularly Bill Paxton's character, lack decent motivation.  It's as though they're UNDERacting the events around them.Overall, pretty lame that they force us through these events when anyone with a history book can give you the ending.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,4,9 July 2003
The Thin Red Line," Dimensions
","Terrence Malick and Steven Spielberg are as similar in their styles of film as rubies resemble oil.  They are entirely different constructs, therefore they make entirely different works.  Obvious comparison will result between 1998's two big war films, Saving Private Ryan and The Thin Red Line, but I honestly have to say that Spielberg's work is the lesser of two evils.Spielberg sees war as something to be glorified according to his 'Making Of' documentary for 'Private Ryan.  Malick doesn't see war as anything other than an extension of his whole philosophical storyline.  To be honest, he doesn't know jack about his topic or setting.  I guarantee you that he could've made the same movie set in Harlem and garnered the same results, only better.  Thus, neither director is intelligent in his approach.  Only Lewis Milestone and Oliver Stone have come close to understand the 'real-world' boundaries of conflict.As such, The Thin Red Line is not a prototypical war film, certainly by comparison to more recent works as Blackhawk Down, Windtalkers, or Enemy at the Gates.  The movie is not about pyrotechnics, but philosophy and psychology.  I am happy that it abandons the stereotypes of 'Private Ryan, but doesn't achieve the level of feeling in Platoon.  While the characters are not likable, they are credible.The cinematography and editing are two elements here that go into overkill. The nagging flashbacks and continuous nature documentary/art house shots rip the story from the film and the various narrations only cause annoyance. Many of his shots are powerful in their fluidity, but the editing is too rocky for them to be effective.  If he is going for spiritual symbolism, he failed.  As a whole, the script becomes second to imagery and mood.  This is Malick's weakest film.  Hans Zimmer's work isn't his usual pompous work (Gladiator, The Lion King, The Rock), but is certainly effective in supplementing Malick's moods, not many composers can do that.Thin Red Line would certainly have been better if Malick took the time to review what others (Kubrick, Milestone, Coppola, and Stone in particular) had done before attempting this film.  Perhaps then he would have avoided many of the cliches and inevitable references that continuously pop up throughout the film.  Overall, you don't need to see this movie because prior films have covered the same territory before.  Malick is a visionary, but a visionary without a script.  2 out of 5 stars.",10,3,7,29 August 2003
The Great Escape," Pranks
","The Great Escape is one of those movies that personifies the dream of prisoners.  Speaking as someone who spent a good deal of time in detention in high school, it is no wonder when I saw this as a junior that I latched onto it so quickly.The storytelling technique in itself is a flop because too many characters are represented, thus we aren't able to identify with them.  John Sturges is a competent director, but some 'serious' moments borderline comedy.  Most of the actors were just too inexpressive (Bronson in particular) that they just became a large, faceless mass of accents.  The Germans are presented in a fashion of stupidity, typical for a movie like this, and the guards' uniforms are an absolute riot to look at, tying with the stormtroopers in Star Wars for ridiculousness.You can argue about the morals and values of the POWs all you want, but when you boil it down, the Great Escape is all one giant prank pulled off by dozens of men to the dismay of their captors.  It's that simple.  Steve McQueen (in the days before Eastwood gave rise to the squinting anti-hero) epitomizes the attitude with his frequent shenanigans.It's interesting how many elements from this movie have been repeated by Steven Spielberg.  Whether it's the initial unveiling of the fence (reminiscent of Jurassic Park) to the anti-climatic motorcycle chase (Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade).  Elmer Bernstein's music is a swing of 60s tension and liveliness, similar to much of his work in Ghostbusters.  He isn't Bernard Hermann, but I'm not complaining.Overall, The Great Escape is a movie that should only be seen from beginning to end.  There isn't any suspense, most of it is predictable, and you may feel more than a little cheated at times.  Nonetheless, between this and Cool Hand Luke, you should understand the whole 60s anti-hero genre very quickly.  End of discussion.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,2,5,19 August 2003
Monty Python and the Holy Grail," Sophomoric Sophistication
","Monty Python and the Holy Grail is a 'box of chocolates' where some have jokes have fillings, others are stale, and still others are overkill.  Being as this is a Python movie (in other words, made on peanuts), I can't helped but be amazed as to how the story bears little resemble to anything else yet falls apart at the end.'Holy Grail resembles Clerks in that there is a vague outline of plot, but it is scanted on because the Python crew is more concerned about gags and funny skits than actually storytelling skill.  Some of the moments are rather creative (I liked the Python animation, it has an cruder unconventional appearance compared to nowadays) and others are just stupid...the ending for example.  How could they consider that an ending?!Overall, Monty Python and the Holy Grail is good for a few laughs, but isn't as sophisticated as many would have you believe.  Life of Brian was only worse because of poor character interaction.  3 out of 5 stars.",10,0,2,4 September 2003
Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back," Learning Game
","George Lucas doesn't understand religion.  He can never convey the concepts and theories of it (or the belief in it for that matter) to any extent. Hence, the best movie he directed is American Graffiti since it is not so concerned with making obvious subtexts.Lucas pretends to know philosophy in the Star Wars series, but he never embellishes on the gray area between his monolithic 'good' and 'evil' sides. That said, The Empire Strikes Back remains the best in the Star Wars series because Lucas lets the reigns of directing fall to someone who knows what they're doing.  Irvin Kerschner is not a talented or smart director, but he has more sense in his head than Lucas.  Lucas' head is stuck in Never Never Land so it is up to Kerschner to add sense to the movie.There is also the support of Lawrence Kasdan (before the man wound up making garbage like Dreamcatcher) and Leigh Brackett touch up his original story in order to remove unnecessary garbage.  As Pauline Kael put it, the movie is not concerned about the 'comic book hedonism' of the original Star Wars. Return of the Jedi would emphasize what happens when Lucas gets his way (again) and hires out some poor sap to direct.  The level of concern about Yoda this time is not the same as the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, smart move.The level of static shots, using just pans and tilts, are marvelous compared to the constant sense of motion that Star Wars wants to make.  It gets worse with Attack of the Clones and Phantom Menace.  The biggest factor is that the effects haven't aged.  The space scenes are elaborate, but not annoying, and John William's score aptly supports them.  Compare the asteroid pursuit here to the vastly inferior one in Episode II, the magic has faded with CGI.Overall, there are good movies and bad ones.  The Empire Strikes Back is not better than Star Wars, it is a quantum leap forward from it.  If any film in the series holds my record for ambition, execution, and presentation...this is it.  4 out of 5 stars.",9,1,2,17 August 2003
Windtalkers," The Woo Method En-Masse
","Ever sine Face/Off, Hollywood has wanted to exploit the one talent John Woo has...cinematography.  I admit that most of the time his scripts and plots are absolute garbage (Broken Arrow, Hard-Boiled) and sometimes he is stuck with terrible acting (Hard Target), but, let's face it, Woo needs Chow Yun-fat as much as CYF needs Woo.  The two are a film 'item', one of the few great combinations of an actor and a director to make repeated visions of the same thing.Enter Windtalkers: many 'great' directors have tried their hands at war (Ridley Scott, Stanley Kubrick, Terrence Malick, Oliver Stone, etc.), but this has to be the worst rendition I have seen yet!  There are so many unnecessary subplots and scenes that the Windtalkers falls into a level of stereotype and idiocy not seen since the days of John Wayne.As in the case of Blackhawk Down, the whole 'plot' is merely a leapfrog from one explosion-laden, cornball heroics-filled, slow-motion infested shoot-'em up.  Perhaps since Spielberg had more time to work on Private Ryan without having to worry so hard about imitation, he made a better film because of it.  Woo is too worried about using his same style over and over that the movie becomes as bad as Mission: Impossible 2.The Woo Method, as I call it, is a 'script doctoring' process wherein any holes in the plot or shallowness in characters can be solved by throwing another gunfight to the audience like milkbones.  Many other directors have this problem, even the Wachowski brothers.  Woo's cinematography is almost total parody and I am sorry for James Horner for getting taken into this project.  No composer I can think of right now should have been involved.Nicolas Cage isn't as effective this time around.  I am sorely disappointed that he was stuck with a cliche role ripped straight from The Big Red One. Actually, the whole movie is nothing more than John Woo's version of The Thin Red Line--all the same nuances and attempts at being creative are here, but none of Malick's spirit is present.Overall, this is a bad movie.

Braveheart," Angry_Arguer vs. William Wallace
","I can see why ordinary laymen love Braveheart so much.  What's not to like about spearings, stabbings, slashings, and other miscellaneous pokings with other sharp objects?Problem is that the film falls too quickly into the whole good vs. evil mentality.  How I HATE that cliche!  Gibson never was high into the 'moral ambiguity' idea, prominent in much of Kubrick and Scott's work.  This movie only emphasizes his lack of education.I will give him credit, though, for trying to make Scotland look ugly and dirty.  After watching this, you'll probably want to take a shower.  Gibson is too obvious in his camera, creating scenes and shots that you wonder why they are there other than eye candy for James Horner's music.  Horner has done better (ALIENS), but he's also done worse (Patriot Games).Overall, Gibson nicely remade this movie with The Patriot and showed how even someone of his stature could screw things up.  I think Braveheart is better than average, but many of its subtexts make it too obvious for its own good.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",8,3,6,27 August 2003
The Breakfast Club," Audio in Montage
","John Hughes will never win an Oscar for 'Original Screenplay', not even with 'Ferris Bueller's Day Off'.  His films focus on white, middle-class teens of varying stereotypes.  Here, he throws everything into the blender.What surprised me about 'The Breakfast Club' was the level of silence.  I'm serious, there is almost an equivalent level of quiet as in '2001: A Space Odyssey'.  Whereas Kubrick used that silence for a purpose, Hughes must have run out of time in production.  Of course, when music is used in 'Breakfast Club', it's not Blue Danube Waltz.  The library is too large to create any mood, but, with a movie like this, don't expect an 'ALIEN' level of quality in production design.  The editor must have been on vacation because the movie could have been 15 minutes shorter and made stronger because of it.  John Hughes' director of photography doesn't catch many memorable images, although Emilio Esteves' monologue is delivered with an obvious pan around reminiscent of 'Reservoir Dogs'.  He will never be a notable character actor, whereas everyone else seems to have a grip on their ideas--except when they're overacting. Question the social issues and problems that are smeared around like bloodstains all you want, I haven't the time for it.Dialogue is the movie's only asset.  Some of the conversations are rather...how should I say...enlightened for a bunch of teenage miscreants. Much of it is Hughes' standard recycled propaganda that he continued repeating, but he's not Kevin Smith.  Had Smith made this movie there would have been many changes, but how effective would they have been?  Indeed, the entire plot is hostage in a prison that never releases any new or inventive ideas.  The adults are the typical Hughes incompetents who 'don't understand' and the kids admit that they hate their parents.  What else is new?  Still, 'The Breakfast Club' is worth watching for the minority that it appeals to as long as they aren't decayed from the wave of 'Modern Teenage Comedies'.  Just thinking about THOSE makes my head hurt.Overall, 3 out of 5 stars.  Love it or leave it, I still enjoyed it.",10,0,1,3 July 2003
Gladiator," Scott is a visual storyteller, but not an auditory one (mild spoiler)
","Director Ridley Scott has rarely made movies that have strong emotional content.  Mostly they are showcases of his visual flair, here is no exception.  Nonetheless, I find Gladiator better than Braveheart for the following reasons.1) More epic in scale and better use of lighting rather than Braveheart's take on Henry V.2) There is a visual style here that Mel Gibson doesn't provide in his movie.  There are many Scott trademark shots and some new ones.3) More characters to deal with.  Overall, Braveheart was Gibson running the whole show.  Here there is a helpful supporting cast to get him through. Kudos to the late Oliver Reed.4) Less outright brutality.  If Braveheart is a medieval version of Saving Private Ryan, then Gladiator is a Roman take on John Woo's 'THE KILLER'. 'Nuff said.Both films have their highs and lows, but the biggest fault I have with this one is that there is very limited sound effects usage.  Only one or two different slash sounds seem to be used for the (MULTITUDE, I kid you not!) stabings.In the end, you may or may not like it so rent it first.

Born on the Fourth of July," The Grass
","My views on Oliver Stone are mixed.  I think Platoon, JFK, Wall Street, and Nixon are both extremely detailed dramas that illustrate American history. However, such work as The Doors, Natural Born Killers, and Any Given Sunday are lesser in quality and, ultimately, fall short of hopes.  Make no mistake, the man can write with persuasion and he can illustrate a story eloquently through camerawork and editing like few others can.Born on the Fourth of July is both good and evil.  The first half, involving Tom Cruise as young Ron Kovic going off to war, are both fascinating in capturing his naivety and youthful angst.  Unfortunately, the second half scrapes along the ground until it finally grinds to a halt.Tom Cruise demonstrates that, between this movie and Rain Man, that he can perform in roles beyond Ethan Hunt and Maverick (roles I am happy to admit that I am entirely sick of).  While I am happy he made this movie, I do not like the overlong runtime.  This movie should not have received it's Oscar for Best Editing and Stone didn't deserve Best Director.  John Williams' score is not as powerful as it could have been.  In many respects, it was only a primer to JFK, nothing more.  The movie also lacks the feeling of authenticity that Stone's better works secrete like sweat, hurting the credibility factor.Overall, required viewing for anyone who wants to consider enlisting in the military.  Drama buffs might find it engaging, but everyone else will most likely be turned off by it--even mainstream Cruise fans.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",8,0,3,24 July 2003
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," Dull
","It never occurred to me just how long and dull this movie is until I watched it yesterday.  Whereas 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a B-movie through and through, 'Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade' tries to be a big-budget James Bond movie.  The visual effects are worse than those in 'Temple of Doom', the sound is atrocious (how did this win Best Sound Effects Editing), and the pacing is totally off. 'Raiders' was almost nonstop and had some of the best action scenes committed to celluloid.  'Last Crusade' tries to duplicate those sensational stuntpieces, but flunks in comparison due to the bigger budget and inferior score by John Williams.  Lastly, the production design on this movie is very pathetic.  None of the locals have the exotic look that 'Raiders' achieved very early.'Wow! Utah in 1912 is such an interesting place!'Bigger is not always better, as displayed in here.  Spielberg throws in his 'sentimental showman' trademark throughout to try and get emotion out of the audience with such matters as Dr. Henry Jones, the father-son relationship, the bigger emphasis on Nazism, etc.  While detail buffs may have a field day with them, they are NOT in the confines of the Indiana Jones universe. 
Having said my lot, I denounce this as yet another Spielberg abomination. Second worst in the series and far from the best.  It's not as fun and tries too hard to be humorous.  Bring back the sadism! Overall, 2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,1,28 May 2003

","Back to the Future is one of those rare, almost forgotten, pieces of pop culture that, surprisingly, draws little attention to itself.  Unlike such notable gimmicks as Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Independence Day, there aren't any low-budget leeches trying to imitate off this work and cash-in on its success. This is due to the near flawless script.  Why it didn't win an Oscar, you're guess is as good as mine.  Making a time-travel storyline as in this movie that doesn't fall into plot holes the size of Terminator's is exceptionally difficult.  I'd know.The film starts slow, and gradually accelerates as it progresses.  You could almost call it a Jerry Bruckheimer movie for kids with Spielberg's trademark nostalgia.  The characters themselves are typical stereotypes for a movie like this and none of them, not even Marty himself, gel with potential.  In some ways it's as if MAD magazine made the film in an attempt to be serious.With such an automotive obsession as this film has, one must wonder if George Lucas was involved.Overall, I have to praise this movie for its inventiveness and originality, even if it created most of our time-travel cliches.  4 out of 5 stars.

","This is your only spoiler warning...Here's an oddity of Hitchcock's, a film so absurd that it makes itself scary.  There is no music or fabricated element to remind you that this is a movie; yet the plot is fantastic and ridiculous.  What's going on here?If I had to label one flaw alone in this movie, it would have to be Hedren. After Hitchcock came away from Bergman and Kelly, this is an major blundering.  Even Novak comes across more interesting.  Hedren resembles Costner, a prop for events to happen against, rather than a real person. Reaction versus acting.The assaults, while their instigation is never explained, rank as one of the 10 most eerie cause & effect scenarios in film.  Others include Se7en and Night of the Living Dead.  The less is told, the more we interpret.  The more we interpret, the more our collective imaginations run.

Jurassic Park," Spielberg is an entertainer (spoiler)
","Let's face it, no matter how hard he tries, Spielberg cannot help but become the sentimental showman that Kubrick wasn't.  That nuance aside, hold onto your lug nuts because thrill rides don't get much bigger or exciting than this!  To make my job easier, I'll just run the pros and cons.Cons: Lack of character development- In Jaws, Spielberg had to rely on technique over style.  Thus he was able to flesh out the characters and make a much more thrilling movie than otherwise planned.  Here we get characters with about 2 sentences worth of exposition and science babbling then another half-hour of screaming and yelling.The Gallimimus herd- I'm sorry but the visual effects in that scene just don't hold up as well as the others.  Also, they could have disposed of it and no one would've noticed any difference.'Over-reliance on technology' motif- I'm talking about the script, not the production. Michael Crichton has never been an effective author and his preachiness in the novel translates into here pretty bad.  Fortunately they were able to get most of his boring moments from the book eliminated.  I still didn't like the annoying part about a 12-year-old being able to hack through a mulit-million dollar computer system to restart the power.Pros: John Williams- Someone give the guy an Oscar! Please!  His music here ranges from intense to breathtaking.  I especially love his main theme and the approach to the island segments, but his finale has to be right up there with 'Cadillac of the Skies' in emotion.The T-Rex attack- Well edited with decent dark humor incorporated and the oft-lauded lawyer chomping. No music though, just like the battles in Private Ryan.The End- Not that I was happy to finally be done watching it, but I just loved how Spielberg ended the movie with William's score and no dialogue. Here's the only time in the movie when he lets the actor's expressions speak for themselves and it works beautifully.Overall, a good movie, though lacking in the brains department,",9,3,4,24 April 2003
Beetlejuice," Triumph of Production Design over Script
","Tim Burton understands the horror/goth genre, unfortunately his only addition has been the mediocre Sleepy Hollow.  Beetlejuice understands the basis for our fears, but never gets far with the idea.  The concept is not as well developed or exploited as it could have been.The real star is not Michael Keaton or anyone else in the cast, it's Burton's use of traditional (stop-motion) effects, makeup, and set design. He is trying to be weird, but winds up being normal.  Without any sort of depth, the mood is humorous instead of deep.  Playing everything for gags in the afterlife more resembles Back to the Future Part II than anything else.With weak performances, this movie can't help but suffer under its own ambition much like the rest of Burton's work.  He always starts strong, then fails at the end except with Planet of the Apes where he failed at the outset.Overall, not as good as it could have been.  Kid's might get a kick out of it, but those looking for a film that understands the genre should try Poltergeist instead.  Satire is more obvious there.  2.5 out of 5 stars.",Null,0,1,16 August 2003

No, I guess that link needs some embellishing.  Journalism is one of those careers where taking extra risks can get you killed, but getting noticed for those risks is minimal to non-existent.

This is not the layered work of 'Alice', though it is a dream, but rather it's an ancestor to 'Terminator 2.'  Just as 'T2' is totally constructed around action, this revolves around music...and it isn't even good listening.With 'classics,' the common phrase I hear in circles is 'good for its day.'

Evil Dead II," Anti-Kafka
","Spoilers!Somewhere between Evil Dead and Army of Darkness something happened to the series.Sam Raimi is arguably the best visual artist of the 80s.  If Brian DePalma demonstrated a knowledge of cinematography with The Untouchables, Raimi beat him with Evil Dead II.  His camera never sits still and exploits almost every shot that can change the look of the film, including the trademark Point-of-View shots.  Evil Dead II is the most fun you can have with camera angles and movement.Action and horror genres are all about repeating the same two or three ideas in different fashions and Evil Dead II is no exception.  Dominant references include Night of the Living Dead, The Exorcist, and Poltergeist.  It isn't scary, it isn't trying to be.  It ties to be what Tim Burton wants in his films--a funny Gothic exercise in visuals.  In this respect, Raimi is ahead of Burton except the Spider-Man movie wasn't able to use this inventiveness and wound up being a poor Batman/Superman cross-breed.  I hope that doesn't start a downward slide.Ash is the first 'hero' of the 90s, everything you find in later heroes is in him.  Ahead of his time, no doubt.  Since the acting is an afterthought, Raimi annihilates cliches and remakes the original.  Just watch Ash fight with his hand, how much fun is that?  Overall, the film itself is stupid, but the picturesque merit of the 'Evil Cam' chasing Ash is well worth your rental fee.  Raimi is smart, I will end it at that.  The only reason this gets a higher than expected rating is because AoD tries to make pop while ED2 insults pop and confuses the audience in the process.  Whee!  2 out of 5 stars.
