Mission: Impossible III," Good old fashioned action thriller
",I will be brief. A very very enjoyable film that you should go and see like right now! imo the best of the three. JJ proves him self worthy for 'celluloid' and stands equal next to de palma and woo (concerning mi films of course). the use of cgi effects was minimal and in a need to use basis which makes the film look more like a 90's action than the PIXAR like action films we are 'fed' these days. Do your selves a favor and enjoy it in a theater not in your couch or pc screen. Although you would think that Hoffman is not up for the role of a bad guy in an action thriller you will find your selves surprised. As far as the Vatican scene i thought that looked familiar and i realized that it 'smelled' like Dan Browns 'Angels & Demons'. Don't wanna spoil it for you though...,9,8,16,3 May 2006
