The Ring," Sending shivers down your spine
",It is a trick to do a horror movie where the fear doesn't jump up on you when you least expect it to dressed in a strange mask. The Ring has like The Exorcist created a good horror feeling by letting the fear slowly creep up on you.And for once you have a script for a horror movie that actually has a story that makes you wanna to know whats gonna happen next.Loved it.

Hellboy," Let's give'em Hellboy...
","This movie falls into the same category as the movies: League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Van Helsing and Wild Wild West: New technique with an old feeling.. give it some strange creatures and a couple of really large cogwheels. But!! this one doesn't fall as flat as the others! It is I guess mostly thanks to the performance of Ron Perlman who does Hellboy just perfectly and the fact that this story most of the times actually make sense.So even if you - like me - never heard about Hellboy before this, it still gives you two hours of good entertainment.I gave it a 7.",7,0,1,19 August 2004
