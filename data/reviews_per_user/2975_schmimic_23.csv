The Mask," Jim Carrey stars in this somewhat amusing flick that is reminiscent of Saturday morning cartoons.
","Starring: Jim Carrey, Cameron Diaz, Peter Greene So, you should have been tipped off by the fact that this movie stars Jim Carrey that it's not really high on the intellectual scale plot-wise. Sure, it's amusing, but it gets less amusing as you get older. Fortunately my maturity level seldom increases dramatically, so I can unashamedly say that I do like this movie. It's just not great by any stretch.Stanley Ipkiss (Carrey) is a low-key quiet banker who keeps to himself for the most part, watches cartoons, and is a doormat for the general public. Then one night Stanley thinks he sees a body floating in the water beside a bridge, only when he gets to it he finds that there is no actual body. He does, however, find an interesting mask. A green mask made of wood. So he takes it home, not thinking too much of it.Then when he's home, he goes to try the mask on, only to find that it's more than a piece of wood. It sucks onto his face, leeches onto his personality, and brings out the wild side of Stanley Ipkiss that nobody ever thought existed. His character is not unlike watching a Saturday morning cartoon as far as the antics he gets into.Then when Stanley is The Mask he commits a few crimes, like robbing the bank he works at, vandalizing his auto repair shop, stuff like that. The police start looking for him and figure out that The Mask and Stanley are one and the same. Eventually a crime lord kind of guy finds Stanley and takes the mask from him, and it turns him into a very powerful, very evil being, capable of practically anything. Then of course Stanley has to stop him, blah blah blah, and that's about it plotwise.Like I said before, it's hardly an intellectual movie. It's semi-amusing and worth at least one watch, provided you don't have to pay more than three or four dollars to do so.Bottom line: 2.5 out of 4 (maybe a renter)",6,0,3,23 April 2005
Minority Report," Spielberg directs this sci-fi action adventure that totally kicks butt.
","Starring: Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell Honestly, I don't think I can remember the last time I watched a Steven Spielberg movie that I didn't like. And I think that Minority Report is probably my favorite Spielberg. Really, I think that Signs and Minority Report were the two best movies to come out in the year of 2002. It's a great sci-fi action flick with really cool special effects and great acting.John Anderton (Cruise) is a pre-crime cop. What exactly is pre-crime? Well, in the future, they have developed a way to track murders and find murderers before they do the deed. Detective Anderton is one of the guys that brings in the murderers before anything happens.One of the most interesting points I think that this movie raises is the notion of predestination. How can we know something was going to happen if we stop it? Are we really in control of our lives, or is everything decided ahead of time? Interesting.But after Anderton starts investigating one of the first pre-crime cases about a woman named Anne Lively being drowned, things start happening. The next pre-crime case that pops up, the murderer happens to be John Anderton himself. In less than forty eight hours, he is supposed to kill a man that he has never met.As the story unfolds, twists and turns come out at every corner. As soon as you think you know something, you're wrong. It's something or someone else. It's a good edge-of-your-seat movie that makes you think if you want to figure out what's going on before it all gets revealed to you.The great thing about this movie is it has plenty of action for the ADHD crowd, but it also has a very complex and detailed plot for the rest of us who want to turn our brains on occasionally when we go to the movies.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10,1,2,23 April 2005
Constantine," Keanu Reeves gives us his trademark Neo character in a new movie about supernatural forces.
","Starring: Keanu Reeves, Rachel Weisz So, how long has it been since our boy Keanu did the Matrix movies? Couple years, right? Well folks, his acting skills have not exactly improved much in that short amount of time. All the same, I don't think he's as horrible as everyone else seems to think. Sure, he's not great, but there are MANY people who are far worse. Anyway, on to the review.John Constantine (Reeves) is a man who has been to Hell and back. Literally. As the tagline says, 'Hell wants him, heaven won't take him, earth needs him.' Constantine is stuck on this planet sending demons back to Hell. Basically, he's an exorcist, plus a little bit more.Then a woman (Weisz) comes to him with an interesting case about a girl who seems to have committed suicide. One particularly interesting thing about the case is that before she jumped off the building, she said Constantine's name. Odd? Perhaps. The girl is Angela's (Weisz) sister, and Angela desperately wants to discover the truth about her death, because as a devout Catholic, she believes her sister's soul would be going straight to Hell if it was a suicide.This movie isn't terribly huge on plot. Were you really expecting it to be if it's starring Keanu Reeves? I mean, c'mon, the guy can't exactly act terribly well. However, despite the fact that EVERYBODY on IMDb is bashing our boy Keanu for his shoddy acting, I don't find it to be all that bad, and for the most part, in this movie, it worked.The movie is a very interesting and very twisted journey through Christianity from a Catholic perspective. It raises questions about the reality of good and evil forces existing in our world as we know it. Are Satan and God really sparring here on Earth? Is this the battleground of the supernatural realm? Maybe.The special effects in this movie are pretty good, the acting is okay from some people (particularly those who have a lead role) and exceptional from others, like Rachel Weisz. I'd go watch it in the theater again, because I thought it was a pretty cool ride.Just don't expect to have to think much.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a look)",9,1,4,23 April 2005
The Day After Tomorrow," From the director of Independence Day comes another low plot, low intelligence, high special effects movie.
","Starring: Dennis Quaid, Jake Gylenhall Roland Emerich directed a few movies that I like. Independence Day, Stargate, and now The Day After Tomorrow. These movies tend to be lower on plot and higher on special effects, but they are still fun to watch. We do, after all, need popcorn movies sometimes.And this movie is definitely a turn off your brain and enjoy the ride kind of movie. If nothing else, you need to watch it just for the special effects. They are that cool.The plot is really quite simple. We've all heard climatologists and meteorologists and experts whining and complaining that at the rate we're burning fossil fuels, we're going to screw up our planet beyond all repair, right? According to this movie, we only have a few short years before that happens. At least that's the estimate Jack Hall (Quaid) comes up with. Then weird things start happening and he finds out his original estimate was a little bit long.What he meant was a few weeks.Hail the size of cabbages start to pummel foreign countries. Tidal waves flood New York. Tornados devastate Los Angelos. In a very short amount of time, a new of time, a new ice age is ushered in.And this ain't just some nasty Saskatchewan snow storm. Temperatures drop so low that stuff freezes faster than you can 'Bob's yer uncle.' Jack's son, Sam (Gylenhall) is stranded in New York with some of his friends. Jack contacts Sam with strict instructions not to leave the library he is shacked up in, because the storm is getting much worse. Just because he can walk around outside without freezing to death right now doesn't mean it'll stay like that.It's a Hollywood movie, so we already know the ending before it gets there. But this ain't a movie that we watch to have our brains strained, so does it really matter? Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (watch it if you're bored)",8,0,1,23 April 2005
Ocean's Twelve," Danny and the crew are back for more adventure and high-stakes thievery.
","Starring: George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon, Catherine Zeta-Jones I found Ocean's Eleven to be a highly entertaining crime caper of a movie.I didn't like the ending because it left everything hanging out, saying one of two things. First, we don't know how to properly end a movie. Second, there's a sequel underway.Fortunately, it was the latter.At the end of Eleven, Danny and the boys get away with their heist, but Terry Benedict's goons are watching them and following them.Enter Ocean's Twelve. Benedict is still a little less than thrilled about being robbed and insulted by Danny and the crew, and he wants his money back. Plus interest. This presents a slight problem, as most of the guys have squandered their 'hard earned' dollars on God only knows what. Hence the premise of the movie; Danny and his fellow ten thieves have fourteen days to come up with the money they took from Terry.The plot of the movie is not terribly difficult to follow if you have more than three quarters of your brain functioning. Translation, it's a good popcorn flick. Nothing wrong with those in my opinion.One drawback to Twelve when compared to Eleven is that there isn't a big, masterful, detailed heist to watch. This may be a slight disappointment to some, but I found it to work just fine, as it gave the director the opportunity to zoom the lens in on the characters and focus on the individuals behind the crimes.The movie does have some very cool scenes and some highly amusing ones as well. For example, there is an amusing segment where Tess has to pretend to be Julia Roberts. This is hardly a perfect film by any stretch, but I would still rank it as a worthy sequel.On a somewhat unrelated note, Julia Roberts is thirty eight. It is not natural for someone to still be that fine when they're pushin' forty.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a look)",9,0,1,23 April 2005
Forrest Gump," Tom Hanks delivers an astounding performance as Forrest Gump.
","Starring: Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Sally Field This was flat out one of the best movies of 1994. It won best picture for a reason, along with a few other Academy Awards. I think one of the tag lines for the movie was, 'The world will never be the same once you've seen it through the eyes of Forrest Gump.' How true. The movie is basically one simple man's journey through life. And what a journey.The movie opens with Forrest (Hanks) sitting at a bus stop, waiting to go see Jenny (Wright) after being apart from her for years. Who is Jenny, you ask? We'll get to that in a minute. Forrest strikes up a conversation or two with the people that come and wait for the bus with him. Or, more accurately, he keeps talking regardless of whether anybody is listening or not. The movie plays out as a flashback, with Forrest taking us through all the major events of his life and narrating them.The flashback starts when Forrest is a little boy, about six years old or so, just at about the age where he should be starting school. We get to take a look at Forrest's childhood as he gets leg braces to straighten out his back, as his momma (Field) fights (and does a few other things) to get him into public school, and as he meets for the first time the love of his life. Jenny. He meets her on the way to school, sitting next to her on the bus, and they strike up a friendship immediately.Eventually we progress to the point where Forrest and Jenny are in high school, and we travel along with Forrest as he makes it onto the football team and gets to go to college. Forrest and Jenny never date, but he's always there to protect her. Anytime he thinks she's in trouble, he rushes to the rescue, ready to beat the ever-loving snot out of anyone who even looks at his Jenny wrong. I think one of my favorite scenes in the movie is when someone is dumb enough to slap Jenny. The film goes slow motion, Forrest's eyes go wide, and he starts charging at this guy like a runaway locomotive, and has the striking force of one too. Watching him beat the crap out of that guy is hilarious.As Forrest grows up and goes through school, college, the army, a Vietnam tour, becomes a ping pong celebrity, a shrimp boat captain, and eventually one of the richest men out there, he also gets to take a few stops in history as the filmmaker gives us his own spin of how he thinks history would have happened if Forrest Gump were there. He gets to meet the President three times, he's the man who exposes the Watergate scandal, he's at the school doors when Governor George Wallace tries to get some Negroes into a white school, and so on and so forth. It's really funny the way they manipulate historical footage to insert Forrest into the events of the past.This is truly a great movie. You'd be a fool to miss it.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10,199,256,23 April 2005
The Matrix Revolutions," The final chapter of the Matrix saga proves to be very confusing.
","Starring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving This movie and Reloaded are actually really just one movie cut into two big pieces, so even if you didn't watch the first movie, you have to watch the second one for this one to make sense. I mean, Reloaded even ends with the words 'To be concluded' flashing across the screen.Revolutions picks up right where Reloaded left off, with Neo (Reeves) in a coma and Bane on the table next to him. At this point we don't know who Bane is, unless we paid REALLY close attention in Reloaded. I won't reveal his identity because I don't do reviews with spoilers.So anyway, they got Neo to the source but the war is still going because he chose to save Trinity (Moss) instead of doing what he was supposed to do. Awwww, how sweet. But now he's stuck in some strange coma after stopping five sentinels in the real world just by holding out his hand. The thing about this coma though, is that his brain waves look like the brain waves of somebody who is connected to the matrix. How can that be, if he isn't plugged into anything? Hmmm Turns out he's in some sort of middle ground. He's at the train station, a middle ground between the program world and the matrix. He can't get out of it unless somebody comes and gets him though. And of course, the Merovingian is the one who has control over the train station. So Morpheus (Fishburne) and Trinity head out for a chat with Merv to get her man back. Then a quick stop over at the Oracle, who has changed her form, and back to the real world for some time to think. It's funny this is still a Matrix movie since very little of the movie is spent in the matrix.After taking a little time to think, Neo comes to the conclusion that he has to take a ship to the machine city. He isn't sure why or what he can do when he gets there, but he just knows that's where he has to go. And he knows he probably won't be coming back. Obviously Trinity volunteers to go with him, and they take Naobi's ship out there. There is an encounter with Bane and his identity is revealed, but like I said, I'm not saying who he is.Back in Zion, the machines are getting ever closer to their precious city and the time of their last stand is drawing near. Neo eventually gets to the machine city and is jacked into the matrix for one last final confrontation with Smith (Weaving) The rest you'll just have to see for yourself. Still a good movie, though not as good as the first or the second.Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth watching)",8,1,2,1 May 2005
The Village," Another movie from Shyamalan. It's not bad, but not on par with the rest.
","Starring: Joaquin Phoenix, Bryce Dallas Howard, Adrian Brody, William Hurt, Sigourney Weaver This is M. Night Shyamalan's fourth movie now. I loved his first three movies to pieces, and I walked into this one with high hopes. Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.The movie is set in the late 1800s in a small village that is cut off from the rest of the world. The inhabitants are not to venture off into the woods or ever go near the woods, because that is where 'Those we do not speak of' live. Those we do not speak of are creatures that the people of the village have a truce with. They leave each other alone and exist apart from each other without disturbing each other. In the village, they hide the colour red for they believe that this colour will upset or anger those they do not speak of.But then strange things start happening. Those they do not speak of enter the village one night and leave red marks on everybody's doors. A few days later, many animals are slaughtered and skinned and the bodies are left all over the village grounds. Many people believe that they should leave the village, but the elders decide that they can still salvage the situation and hopefully patch things up with their 'friends.' But then a tragedy occurs in the village. One of the young men, Lucius, (Phoenix) who makes his intentions to marry one of the young women (Howard) known is stabbed by a jealous individual (Brody). The only way that Lucius can be saved is if somebody leaves the village, goes back to the towns, and gets proper medication. Otherwise, he will die in a matter of days.The girl he was planning on marrying, Ivy, who is blind, volunteers to go to the town to get the medicine for her fiancé in hopes of saving him. The elders object to this course of action, or at least they would if her father didn't let her go without telling the rest of the elders. He lets her in on a few secrets but doesn't let her know too much. Just enough to help her get to the town, get the supplies, and get back.As in all of Shyamalan's movies, there's a twist. But this one is a little more predictable than the other ones. I saw it coming a ways off, and I found this movie to actually be pretty boring. It wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. Overall, it had a pretty mediocre feeling to me.Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth watching)",8,0,0,23 April 2005
The Fast and the Furious," Big cars go zoom and acting abilities are nowhere to be seen. GAG.
","Starring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker So, I'm sure we all remember when this movie came out. Had a nice little preview with fast cars and well, fast cars. I think it came out shortly after Gone in 60 Seconds. Which was a good movie. This one is, well, a movie. Your call as to whether it's good or not.Brian O'Connor (Walker) is an undercover cop who poses as a street racer. His assignment right now is to watch Dom (Diesel), who is the main suspect in a high-tech ring of highway robberies. We don't know who the bad guys are in this movie for a while, but eventually we find out that it is in fact Dom and his crew doing the highway robberies. If you haven't seen it and I spoiled it for you, my apologies. Hopefully that'll keep you from watching it now.I don't think the plot goes much deeper than that which I have just mentioned. This movie is about two things. The babes, and the cars. There's quite a few of each that are very good looking. For the most part the cars are better in this one though.I'm not really sure what else to write in this review. That's how much the plot is weak sauce. I mean, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker have to hold this movie on their shoulders. And who do they get for backup? Ja Rule. Good grief people. Couldn't we find one decent actor? Guess not. Really, if you ever bother watching this movie, realize right from square one that this movie is not about the plot or the acting. It's about the big zoom zoom that the cars make. If that floats your boat, rent this. In my estimation you'd be better off giving Gone in 60 Seconds a look.Bottom Line: 2 out of 4 (I wouldn't bother)",5,0,1,23 April 2005
Meet the Fockers," Greg Focker is back for another round of laughter and embarrassment in this sequel to Meet the Parents.
","Starring: Ben Stiller, Robert DeNiro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbara Streisand So most of us watched Meet the Parents, right? Oddly enough, first time I saw Meet the Parents, I didn't like it that much. It just picked on poor Greg (Stiller) too much. I started to like it more with time, and now I can appreciate it a bit better.The sequel, Meet the Fockers, I found far more amusing. It picks up a few months after the first movie. Greg and Pam are set to get married pretty soon, but the parents still need to meet. Greg is a little bit apprehensive about this meeting because he knows what Pam's dad Jack (DeNiro) is like, and he knows what his parents (Hoffman and Streisand) are like. I mean, a stiff necked ex-CIA agent and a couple aging hippies? It's like watching an episode of Dharma and Greg. Wait, I'll bet that's where they got the inspiration for this movie So the Byrnes' drive out to the Focker threshold to meet the new in-laws, and it's at about this point that the movie gets really hilarious. Dustin Hoffman plays Greg's dad Bernie so well I think he's absolutely hilarious.I think the reason I probably liked this one better than the original is that it's less harsh on Greg. Sure, his parents are embarrassing, but things don't go as bad. Or at least they don't go as bad in the same way. Things do still turn out pretty bad. I mean, how would you react if your parents brought out a scrapbook from your childhood and your foreskin was in it? Yikes. I think I'd die, but I'd take my parents with me.I'm not really sure what else to say about this movie. Some of the humour is pretty crude and overtly sexual, but it's not too too bad. It could have been a lot worse.Those who liked Meet the Parents will definitely want to Meet the Fockers.Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth a view)",8,1,2,23 April 2005
The Princess Bride," The classic cult movie, otherwise known as 'The Greatest Movie of All Time.'
","Starring: Cary Elwes, Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin, Andre the Giant I felt it would be wrong to make a hobby of writing movie reviews if I didn't start with my favorite movie of all time.So, the movie was made in the late 80s. The reason I mention this is because if you haven't seen it, prepare for a smattering of cheesy acting and low budget glory. However, this does not detract from the overall appeal of the film. If anything, it adds. For the 80s, this is an exceptional movie. For any time period, this is an exceptional movie.It all takes place in the imaginary kingdom of Florin, ruled by the charismatic and devious Prince Humperdink (imagine what elementary school was like for THAT guy). Technically, he is not yet the king, but in the same way that Cardinal Richeleau ruled France in The Three Muskateers, so does Prince Humperdink rule Florin.The heart of the movie opens on a small farm, where Buttercup, allegedly the most beautiful girl in the kingdom, is living her life. She commands Westley, the farm boy, around for pleasure. Eventually she realizes that Westley loves her, sparks fly, and we are hit with one of the movie's most infamous lines: 'Hold it, hold it! Grandpa, what is this? Are you trying to trick me? Where's the sports? (pause) Is this a kissing book?' Westley has no money for marriage, so he sets out in seek of fame and fortune. In a matter of weeks, news comes back to Buttercup that Westley has been murdered by the Dread Pirate Roberts. Five years later the Prince decides that he is going to take Buttercup as his wife, and the movie sets into action. A mysterious Man in Black (like we don't know who it is) comes to get Buttercup, and faces impossible odds to get her, fighting master swordsmen, giants, and of course, Vizzini, in the classic Battle of Wits.The movie is a fairy tale, and as such, we know right from the beginning it is going to have a cheesy happy ending. Does that really matter? Of course not. First off, it's just entertainment. Second, the point of the movie is that true love conquers all. A nice little romanticized thought, even if evidence of this fact often fails to be seen in the real world.For the most part, the acting is solid. Cary Elwes does a knockout job as Westley, Robin Wright as the naïve but charming Princess Buttercup, Mandy Patinkin as Inigo Montoya, the master swordsman seeking revenge for his father, Andre the Giant as Vizzini, the big hearted yet small brained giant, Wallace Shawn as Vizzini, the criminal mastermind with a large IQ and yet no real intelligence, Billy Crystal in a strange turn as Miracle Max, and Peter Falk as the grandfather telling the story to his sick grandson. The acting is not flawless, but for the type of movie that this is, it is spot on.This is the must see movie of the century. It has action, romance, comedy, adventure, and suspense. If you haven't seen it, you must.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (a must see)",10,2,4,23 April 2005
The Incredibles," Maybe I'm biased, but I think this was by far the best movie of last year. Go watch it now.
","I wanted to see this movie right from the moment that I saw the teaser trailer on the Finding Nemo DVD. I love Pixar movies. I think they're great. I thought Toy Story, A Bug's Life, Toy Story 2, Monsters Inc., and Finding Nemo were all top notch. That being said, The Incredibles blows all the aforementioned movies out of the water.Back in the 60s, superheroes were everywhere. One of the most popular superheroes, if not the most popular, was Mr. Incredible. With amazing strength and a strong social conscience, everybody loved him. But then, one day/night while he's out doing his superhero thing, a few things happen. He saves a man from committing suicide, and breaks his neck in the process. The suicidal man sues Mr. Incredible. Also, when a bomb falls onto LRT tracks, Mr. Incredible has to charge in front of a train and use his body to stop it, throwing all the passengers around, sustaining various injuries. They all sue him too. As a result, the government forces all superheroes to hang up their capes and either get lost or enter civilian life.Fifteen years later, Bob Parr, a.k.a. Mr. Incredible, is an insurance agent. He is bored, fat, middle-aged, and unhappy. He does everything he can to help his clients out, which obviously upsets his boss. What insurance company wants to be paying out fat dividends when their clients get injured? After Bob's boss has a little chat with him and Bob 'accidentally' throws his boss through about five walls, Bob finds himself unemployed.However, as he clears out his briefcase, he notices a foreign object. It looks almost like a little t.v. screen, only very thin. In true Mission Impossible style, it's a device used to contact Mr. Incredible with details on a new assignment. And then the device self-destructs, setting off the smoke alarm.Bob is a little bit bored with his life, so it's a refreshing change to actually be needed by somebody to do something incredible (bad joke, I know). He gets flown out to a remote island to fight a robot, with the instructions to only shut it down and not destroy it. A little bit hard to do when it's trying to kill you, I think. But he does it. After all, he is Mr. Incredible.So over the next few weeks, the Parr family thinks that their husband/father has been promoted at the insurance agency as he's having more money to throw around, driving fancier cars, dressing better, working out, spending time with his family, and just getting a general zest for life back.Eventually he gets contacted with more assignments, all the while telling his family he's just going off for business meetings and things of the nature.I think that's enough of a spill on the plot of the movie to hopefully work up the appetite of all of you who have not yet seen this movie. My suggestion would be to just go out and buy it. If I don't get this movie for my birthday, I think I'll have to buy it. Not because I want to, because I have to. It's just that good.The animation is great, the action is great, the storyline is great. It has drama, action, humour, suspense, and oh so much more. In my opinion, this was the best movie of 2004.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10,0,1,23 April 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Clint Eastwood scores another home run directing this heartbreaking story about a determined woman boxer.
","Starring: Clint Eastwood, Hilary Swank, Morgan Freeman Boxing is a sport that I personally do not appreciate. Two guys go into the squared circle, put on some gloves, and beat the living crap out of each other. To me, that isn't entertainment. That's just stupidity.If nothing else though, I admire the people who go through that rigorous training and have the physical skill and strength to be such incredible fighters.Million Dollar Baby is a movie all about boxing. Frankie (Eastwood) is an over the hill boxing trainer and manager who owns a gym. His prize fighter is on the verge of being ready for a title match, but Frankie holds him back for a few more fights so that he's ready. His fighter doesn't want to wait and finds a new manager.From the beginning of the movie, there is a woman frequently showing up at the gym to train. Her name is Maggie (Swank), a southerner from a poor background with dreams and a truckload of ambition. She wants Frankie to be here manager, but Frankie doesn't train girls. No matter how hard Maggie tries to convince him, Frankie doesn't budge.Eventually, after his fighter leaves him, Frankie has a change of heart and decided to take Maggie on. They form a friendship that almost seems like a father/daughter relationship. Frankie looks out for Maggie all the time, doing his best to protect her, guide her, train her, and send her forward into the boxing world. Maggie advances and eventually gets a title bout. But tragedy strikes. Specifically, I will not say what, but Maggie's boxing career comes to an abrupt and tragic end.The rest of the movie is very difficult to watch because you feel genuinely sorry for Maggie when you see her lying in that hospital bed. At points in the movie I felt my eyes getting a little moist.Million Dollar Baby is a very well done movie. The acting is superb, the plot is great, the movie is mostly clean. But the ending is far too tragic for my taste. I watch movies to be entertained. Not depressed.This movie is very good in a The Green Mile or Forrest Gump kind of way.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth a look)",9,4,6,23 April 2005
The Matrix Reloaded," Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus are back for more martial arts and Matrix style action.
","Home Songs Poetry Reviews Links Pics Downloads Forum GuestbookThe Matrix ReloadedRating: RStarring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo WeavingSo, if you haven't already seen the first Matrix, you should obviously watch it before you watch this one. That being said, I'm going to write this review on the assumption that you've all seen the first one, you know that Neo is the one, blabada blee, bleebadee bloo.The movie opens with an interesting sequence where Trinity (Moss) rides a motorcycle off a building and jumps off before it crashes into a security building. Next part of the sequence, she jumps out the window of a skyscraper with an agent right behind her, the cool matrix bullet time effects kick in, and eventually Trinity gets shot and crashes into a car on the ground. Then Neo (Reeves) wakes up.He's been having this dream before, or at least dreams like it, and oddly enough, it's starting to get him a little bit jumpy. Morheus (Fishburne) believes the end of the war with the machines is coming, and of course that Neo will bring about this end. He takes his ship home but orders one other ship to remain outside of Zion and stay in the matrix so that the Oracle can contact them.Zion is an interesting looking city, and despite its rough unfurnished exterior, it still appears to have a homie feel about it. Everybody gets a little R and R, Neo and Trinity get their freak on, and then it's back out into the real world.When Neo goes to see the Oracle, something interesting happens when he's done talking to her. Agent Smith (Weaving) comes to see him. But how? Wasn't he killed in the first movie? Apparently Smith refused to die, and now he has the ability to copy himself on anybody in the matrix, so there are hundreds of thousands of Smith clones running about, looking for Neo.Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity all pay the Merovingian a visit to try to get the keymaker from him. They need the keymaker so they can get inside the source, which is where they believe Neo can do his thing and turn the tables on the war with the machines.I predicted before I ever watched this movie that it would be like the original Star Wars movies. First one is a stand alone that could have sequels, and at the end of the second, there are tons of loose threads that need to be tied up, meaning there has to be a third movie. I won't say what all the loose threads are. You'll just have to see it yourself. Overall, this movie is a solid action movie with some great martial arts sequences, not to mention the infamous highway chase scene.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth watching)",9,1,3,1 May 2005
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," And on this note, Star Wars is finally done being milked. Except for the DVD sales now, of course
","Okay, before I get to the core of this review, I'd like to make a couple notes. First, it was very pleasant to have the nearly complete absence of Jar Jar in this installment of the Star Wars saga. I can handle it if all he does is make a small cameo and his mouth never opens. Second, somebody really needs to tell George that it gets pretty annoying after a while if you use all those different scene transition effects, all the wipes and swooshes and swirls. He's like a teenager who is just learning how to use Powerpoint. But I digress.So I'm sure the core of Star Wars elite nerds knew everything that was going to happen in this movie before they ever saw it. I saw a few of those nerds in the mall the other day, dressed in their full Star Wars garb. A few storm troopers, a clone trooper, and a healthy smattering of Jedi were patrolling the West Edmonton Mall. But that's beside the point. For those of us who saw the early episodes, and I imagine most people who saw III have seen I and II, we know that Anakin and Padme are married. And for those who have seen the original trilogy, we know that Anakin Skywalker is going to become Darth Vader, everybody's favorite galactic villain. That's what this movie is really about. The fall of the Republic, the transition of Anakin into Darth Vader, and the birth of the Skywalker children.The movie starts off with a big space fight in progress. The opening credits inform us that two Jedi trying to rescue Chancellor Palpatine. The two Jedi are in fact, Obi-Wan and Anakin, and they come on the scene in a couple fighter ships swirling and swooping and avoiding enemy fire while trying to get to General Grievous' ship, where the chancellor is being held prisoner. They get there, find the chancellor, Count Dooku shows up and we have a little good versus evil confrontation, and of course evil gets its butt kicked. Dooku loses his head at the hands of Anakin, after being goaded into killing a disarmed man be the chancellor. It's already by this point where we start to wonder if the chancellor is a friend or foe.But they get the chancellor off the ship, head back to safety, Anakin bumps into Padme, he finds out she's pregnant. This is obviously a bit of a dilemma for them as nobody on the Jedi council even knows they're married. It's something they've been hiding. Anakin starts having nightmares about complications during the delivery where Padme dies, and he feels that these are predictions of the future.Later Anakin is assigned a position in the Jedi council, but not as a master. The main reason the Jedi want him on the council is because they were persuaded by the chancellor, and also because they want Anakin to spy on the chancellor for them. They have doubts as to where his loyalties lie. Anakin talks to the chancellor, who knows about the dreams he's been having about Padme dying, and he informs Anakin that there is a way that she can be saved, by utilizing the dark side of the force. The chancellor keeps insisting to Anakin that a true master harnesses both sides of the force to achieve a balance that none others could have, making him more powerful than all the other Jedi before him.So that's the carrot that gets dangled in front of Anakin's face as a little temptation to switch over to the dark side. The movie definitely has a very Star Warsish feeling to it, and I'm sure this was George's final attempt to pacify the nerds after Episodes I and II, not to mention to milk that cow for every last buck he can.Me, I'd say it was okay, but nothing special.Bottom Line: 3 out of 4 (worth watching)",8,1,3,24 May 2005
The Terminal," Tom Hanks plays Viktor Navorski, a Russian stuck in an airport terminal when his country ceases to exist.
","Starring: Tom Hanks, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Stanley Tucci Imagine that you're flying to a foreign country where you really don't know the language all that well. While you're in the middle of your flight, there is a war in your home country and the government is overthrown. Essentially, your country ceases to exist. When you get to the foreign country, they won't let you in without a valid passport, which you can't get without a country. So they tell you that you can't leave the airport terminal. That you have to wait there until further notice.That's the situation that Viktor Navorski (Hanks) from Krahkohzia (yes, it's a fictional country, and I don't have the first clue how it's spelled) finds himself in.The Terminal is an absurdly amusing comedy/drama that's all the more entertaining because you have to wonder, what if something like this actually happened? Is it possible? I really don't know, but I'd hate to think that someday I'll be out touring the world and get stuck in some foreign terminal for nine months when Canada stops existing.So since Viktor has nowhere to go, he makes a life for himself at JFK Airport in New York City, unable to go into the United States and unable to fly back to Krahkohzia. He makes a room for himself at Gate 67, an abandoned gate that is in dire need of construction. Without the ability to buy food (Krahkohzian dollars are not really worth anything in the States), Viktor has to find alternate means to feed himself. Soon he discovers that when you return baggage carts to their stalls, you get a quarter as a small reward. So he runs around the terminal collecting a whole bunch of them so that he can feed himself.We don't really find out until very close to the end of the movie just why Viktor came to America. But he does finally accomplish his task, and his country is reestablished and he gets to return home.We all knew the ending from the beginning of the movie. The real fun of it is how the movie answers the question of 'What if.?' Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth watching)",9,0,1,23 April 2005
The Shawshank Redemption," Flat out one of the most jaw-droppingly amazing movies ever made.
","Starring: Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman There are some movies that when you watch them you can't help but feel you've done more than watch a movie. Sometimes it feels like you've been part of something bigger, like you witnessed a masterpiece. The Shawshank Redemption is like watching poetry. It is one of the most tragic, heartfelt, and deeply satisfying stories to have ever been put onto the big screen. There really is a reason that this movie is number two on the internet movie database's top movies of all time.The premise of the movie is fairly simple. Andy Dufraine (Robbins) is wrongfully accused with the murder of his wife and her lover, and he is sentenced to two life sentences to be served back to back at Shawshank prison. The plot is simple, and yet at the same time deeply complex. This movie is a celebration of the human spirit, a celebration of hope and of freedom.Life is difficult for Andy right from the beginning of his life sentence. It takes him at least a month before he goes and talks to anyone. The first person he does talk to is Red (Freeman), a man in the prison who is able to get things. Need to get a pack of cigarettes, a toothbrush, maybe some playing cards, then Red is your man on the inside. Andy asks Red to pick up a rock hammer so that he can carve stones.This movie is anything but a fairy tale. It depicts prison life as being cruel, unfair, bitter, and downright horrible. Decent people die, people get gang raped, the guards beat the ever-loving daylights out of anyone who steps out of line. Shawshank prison is one hard place to serve your time.After being in prison for a couple years, Andy gets transferred from laundry duty to library, mainly so the warden can send his men over to get financial advice from Andy. Andy starts doing income tax for the guards and the warden, setting up trust funds, and various other financial services, and after a few years, he becomes the man who launders the warden's dirty money. Sure, he got transferred to the library, but the only difference is he's washing money and not sheets and clothes.Andy takes up all sorts of projects while he's in Shawshank. He makes chess pieces for a chess board, he makes it his personal task to obtain funds for and build a new prison library. He helps several of the inmates get their high school equivalence. He does whatever he can to pass the time and keep himself a little bit sane.I'd hate to spoil the ending for anybody who hasn't seen this movie, so I will be very vague. All I will say is that it is one of the most satisfying and beautiful endings to any movie or story that has ever been captured. This movie is a masterpiece, and you would do yourself a favour to make sure you watch it. And if you've already seen it, watch it again, and introduce somebody else to the world of Shawshank prison.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10,0,1,24 April 2005
Bruce Almighty," Jim Carrey delivers his trademark antics in this little comedy gem about the responsibility of playing God.
","Starring: Jim Carrey, Morgan Freeman, Jennifer Anniston I was really quite skeptical the first time I watched this movie. I mean, what a conceptual NIGHTMARE. Jim Carrey playing God? Nothing is sacred anymore.Well, this movie is hardly sacred, but it also is not sacrilegious, at least not to any great extent. Yes, Jim Carrey has the powers of God for a while, but he is not God. Confused? I'll give you the low down.Jim Carrey plays Bruce Nolan, a reporter who is down on his luck and feeling very unsuccessful with his life. He lives with his beautiful girlfriend, Grace (Anniston), and you can tell right off the bat that they love each other, but the relationship is on fairly shaky ground.Then Bruce gets a shot at anchorman, only to have it underhandedly stolen by Evan Baxter. Obviously not please, Bruce shares his thoughts with the world through the television in a way which is comical and definitely worthy of getting him fired.Much complaining and griping about God later, Bruce gets a page. After a while he gets tired of it calling, so he responds and goes to the Omni Presents building (heh). There he meets God (Freeman), who is the Boss, Electrician, and Janitor of the building. I found this highly amusing. God is the Boss, the Holy Spirit is the Electrician, and Jesus Christ is the Janitor. Think about it. Boss, obvious. Electrician, the guy who keeps everything running. Janitor, the guy who cleans up the mess that the world has left. BRILLIANT.Anyway, Bruce is a little skeptical about having actually met God, but when God gives Bruce his powers and gives him a shot at playing God, he starts to believe a bit. Wonder why. Enter the flagrant abuse of powers for personal gain and to abuse the enemies.Since this is Hollywood, Bruce obviously eventually smartens up, learns his lesson, and starts using his powers for the good of the world. In the end he cries out for God to take it away and prays that His will be done, not Bruce's.Since it is Jim Carrey, the movie is quite amusing, and there are definitely some highly entertaining moments in it. The movie is not perfect theology, but for Hollywood, it is definitely a good attempt. Many statements in the film can be quite thought provoking and even challenging, and I applaud Tom Shadyac for his effort in this movie.So, while far from perfect, definitely an amusing popcorn movie with a little bit of thought behind it.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (worth a view or two)",9,91,124,23 April 2005
Signs," Shyamalan's third movie is an alien movie that takes us in a totally different direction than we would normally expect.
","Starring: Mel Gibson, Joaquin Phoenix Shyamalan's third movie, Signs, is probably my favorite of the three that I have seen. I like them all a lot, but this one is just a cut above the rest in my opinion. In the same way that Sixth Sense is the horror movie that isn't and Unbreakable is the super hero movie that isn't, Signs is the alien movie that isn't.Early in the movie, Graham Hess (Gibson) find something unusual in his fields. Crop circles. Is it a hoax? Is it a practical joke by somebody in the town? What made the circles? Graham's children, Bo and Morgan both believe right away that they were made by something not human, but Graham and his brother Merrill (Phoenix) have their doubts. Crop circles? It has to be a hoax, right? Then other things start happening. The dogs start acting strangely. Bo comes to Graham in the middle of the night and claims that there is a monster outside of her room. Graham and Merrill go outside to scare the intruder off. They chase him around the house, but when they meet on the other side, the intruder is on the roof. How? Then more odd things happen. Graham finds someone, or something, walking around in his cornfield. Alien signals get picked up through baby monitors. Lights are floating in the sky all across the world. Eventually Graham and Merrill drop their doubt and admit that there are aliens out there.The movie has a very claustrophobic atmosphere. Most of the movie takes place on the Hess farm. But it works. In the cramped atmosphere, we feel just as trapped as the Hess family. Shrouded in confusion and fear, unsure of what exactly is going to happen.I won't tell you how they get rid of the aliens, but it is hardly in a conventional manner. This movie sharply contrasts movies like Independence Day where aliens come in big spaceships with big guns to blow up the world. Instead they come with ground troops and strategy.This movie is well acted and cleverly written, and it is one of my favorite movies.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10,0,2,23 April 2005
The Sixth Sense," M. Night Shyamalan's first movie is a brilliant psychological thriller with a fantastic twist.
","Starring: Bruce Willis, Haley Joel Osment Director M. Night Shyamalan pretty much came out of nowhere. We weren't expecting him or what he was going to bring to us, but then, he was there. And he left a huge impact on the film industry.His first film, The Sixth Sense, which he wrote and directed, and played a small role in, is an eerie psychological thriller. It's the horror movie that isn't a horror movie. It doesn't make you jump out of your seat and crap your pants, but it leaves you with this creepy, eerie feeling.Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) is a child psychologist. After winning an award for his work, he comes home one night to find that one of his old patients is waiting for him in his house. With a gun. The patient shoots Malcolm and then turns the gun on himself.Several years later Malcolm comes across an interesting case. Cole Sear (Osment) has a problem that he doesn't want to tell anybody about. Cole starts talking to Malcolm, and Malcolm slowly learns more about Cole. He discovers that he has cuts on his arms, that he kleptos from churches, that he speaks Latin. He wears his father's old glasses and watch. Malcolm decides very quickly that Cole is a very interesting, very bright, but very disturbed child.Eventually, after Cole feels that he can trust Malcolm, he tells Malcolm his secret. He sees dead people. People who walk among us, not even knowing that they are dead. Nobody else can see them, but he can.The movie has several very creepy moments when dead people with pieces of their head missing, or massive cuts, or vomiting, appear to Cole and try to talk to him. Cole cannot figure out why they come to him, and they scare him to death.Malcolm eventually helps Cole realize that he is the only that can help these people. Cole learns how to conquer his fear and talk to the dead people and to help them with their issues.Osment does a superb job of acting in this film, especially considering his age. Willis also does a fine job, but the spotlight is always on Haley.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10,1,1,23 April 2005
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter star in this classic eighties movie. Whoa!
","Starring: Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter, George Carlin Ahhh, what a classic slice of the eighties. Really, cheesy eighties movies don't get any better than this in my opinion. And cheesy this one is. Amazingly so.So, basically, here's the story. Bill (Winter) and Ted (Reeves) are a couple of guys who have the combined intelligence of a jar of peanut butter. They aspire to start a band called Wyld Styllyns despite the fact that they don't even possess the knowledge of how to play their guitars. They talk like a couple of surfers from the late eighties, using intelligent words like 'heinous,' 'bodacious,' 'excellent,' 'bogus,' and so on. It can get a little bit annoying, but it's not like people didn't use to talk like that (scary, isn't it?).The tagline of the movie is 'History is about to be re-written by two guys who can't even spell.' That hits the nail pretty much right on the head. Theoretically, in the future, the music that Bill and Ted make will bring about a time of galactic peace. It unites the planets and so on and so forth, blah blah blah. But the problem is, the band will never be started if they fail their history class. Because if they fail history, they fail high school, and Ted's dad will send him off to military school in Alaska.Obviously this can't happen, so a man from the future, Rufus (Carlin), is sent back in time to aid Bill and Ted with their final history project. If they get an A+ on that project, then they will pass the class, they pass high school, and the band will be started.So how are they going to pass this history assignment? Simple. Use a time traveling phone booth that Rufus brought with him, kidnap a ton of historical figures and put them all in a big presentation.So the airhead dudes travel through time and kidnap Billy the Kid, Socrates (pronounced so-cratesÂ…), Sigmund Freud, Joan of Arc, Genghis Kahn, Abraham Lincoln, and Ludwig Von Beethoven (pronounced bee-thuv-en).It really is a weak plot, but it's so imaginative and original and ludicrous that it makes the movie worth watching. Plus the high energy horrible acting of Keanu Reeves and Alex Winter make it truly hilarious. It's a great flick.The funny thing is, I think the only thing that's changed about Keanu from then to now is that he has shorter hair now. Man still can't act.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (give it a watch)",9,0,0,23 April 2005
The Matrix," The first chapter of the Matrix trilogy is still far and away the best.
","Starring: Keanu Reeves, Laurence Fishburne, Carrie-Anne Moss, Hugo Weaving 'What is the Matrix?' The fundamental question that had moviegoers and critics across the world bedazzled in the year of 1999. Science fiction and action movies would never be the same after this blockbuster stormed the scene with its blazingly original visuals and bizarre yet detailed concepts.Thomas Anderson, a.k.a. Neo (Reeves) is a software programmer who is living two lives. In one he is Thomas Anderson, a regular Joe who goes to work, goes to church, and 'helps his landlady take out her garbage.' In the other life, he is Neo, a computer hacker who is guilty of essentially every computer crime there is a law for. One night he's asleep at his computer, when his computer starts talking to him. Not literally, but flashing text across the screen. He follows the instructions his computer is giving him and goes to a club where he meets Trinity (Moss), another hacker, or at least that's what he thinks.When he's at work the next day, a package from FedEx comes to him containing a cell phone. As soon as he gets the phone in his hand, it starts ringing, and Morpheus (Fishburne) is on the other end of the line with him, telling him that the FBI are here to get him. Neo stands up, and sure enough, the fibbies are over at the elevator, ready to come and arrest him. Morpheus gives Neo instructions on how to escape the feds and get to safety, but Neo can't muster the courage to go out on a ledge (literally) and take a scaffold to the roof, so he gets taken in by the feds.After an interesting encounter with the FBI, Neo is contacted again by Morpheus, who tells him where he should go if he wants to meet. They meet, and Neo asks what the matrix is. In the words of Morpheus, 'Unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is. You have to see it for yourself.' Neo has two options. Take the blue pill, and he continues his life how it has been going. Take the red pill, and enter a whole new world. Of course, he opts for the red pill, and he is released from the matrix and wakes up in the real world.So what is the matrix then? In a nutshell, it's a computer driven simulation that keeps human minds busy so that machines can harvest our bodies for power. Morpheus freed Neo from the matrix because he believed that Neo was essentially the savior of mankind, foretold by the prophecies.I think that's enough of a summary of the gist of the movie. The rest of it you just have to see for yourself. It's truly an amazing action movie with some of the coolest and craziest visuals you could possibly imagine. It's just one of those things that you have to see for yourself to actually believe.Bottom Line: 4 out of 4 (own this movie)",10,1,2,1 May 2005
Donnie Darko," Jake Gylenhall stars in this eerie psychological thriller about a paranoid schizophrenic teen who hallucinates.
","Starring: Jake Gylenhall, Jena Malone, Drew Barrymore, Patrick Swayze The first time I watched this movie, I was anything but impressed. It made no sense to me, and it just seemed totally and utterly pointless. A complete waste of my time. But the more I thought about the movie and tried to analyze what it was really about, the more I thought I should give it another chance.So I gave it another view today. And I've decided that I really like this movie. It's insanely messed up, but so incredibly undeniably interesting.Donnie Darko (Gylenhall) is a boy in his late teens with some serious issues. He seems to be suffering from paranoia and schizophrenia, not to mention he is hallucinating. He keeps hearing from an imaginary friend of his, Frank. A giant rabbit with a hideously disfigured face. Frank is very creepy to look at, and looks like something you'd only see in a nightmare.Frank starts telling Donnie to do different things, and he does them. He breaks the water main at his school and floods it. He burns down the house of some motivational speaker that has been at his school. Frank keeps telling him to do other things of the nature, and Donnie listens to him.But the strangest thing that Frank tells Donnie is that the world is going to end in about a month. The whole movie builds to the climax when the world is supposed to end, and at that point some of the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, but there are still so many missing.One of the most interesting things that this movie brings up is the notion of predetermination. At one point in the movie, Donnie sees everybody walking along with a trail of what appears to be water leading from their chest out into the world. As they continue moving about their day, they catch up with this predetermined trail. The paradox that Donnie grapples with is, if we know what our path is and it is predetermined, is there anything we can do to change it, or should we even try? Who knows.This movie is a dark and haunting psychological thriller. If you like your movies to come to a certain and complete ending by the time the credits are rolling, then don't watch this movie, or you will spend hours beating your head against a wall screaming 'WHY???' I know I did the first time I watched it.Bottom Line: 3.5 out of 4 (definitely worth a look)",9,0,1,23 April 2005
