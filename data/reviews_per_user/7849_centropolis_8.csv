Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," One of the year's worst.
","I must say. I hated this movie. I hate Star Wars. It was so over-hyped. I Can't stand Natalie Portman, and you want to kill Jake Lloyd. Niether can act. Liam Neeson and Ewan McGregor were wasted....very sadly. Samuel L. Jackson? Come on! Lucas, can make a movie. This movie is loved to pieces. But for a person who is looking for a movie with tone, characters, plot, development, direction, writing, and acting. Avoid at all costs. Oh yeah, give Darth Maul the Oscar. He showed the most drama depth in this movie.",1,1,2,28 August 2000
Se7en," One of the best films I have ever seen.
","I can't spoil this film for you. It is very rough. It is very violent. It has incredible suspense. The direction is absoloutley amazing. Darius Khondi's photography is amazing. Brad Pitt is terrific, as always. Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow are very good also. This movie is riveting. See it once, see it twice.",10,0,1,29 August 2000
Fight Club," DAVID FINCHER IS MY HERO!
","My age: 14David Fincher directs this puppy like no tomorrow. His visuals are very impressive, as usual. His editing is like a machine gun, by James Haygood. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give blisteringly uncompromising performances. It is plain awesome. See this film. Unless you are naive. Please see this movie.",10,0,2,17 June 2000
American Psycho," One of the year's best.
","This is truly awesome. I loved everything about this movie, although, it was not the book, it was still a terrific movie. Director Mary Harron left out appropriate things, such as the rat incident. This movie is terrificly made. Allthough, many of you pansies out there might not like the tone, you don't look at the many positive things about this movie. Decide for yourself. I however, loved Christian Bale, and I wish Willem Dafoe would make more movies. P.S. The nail-gun scene is HILARIOUS.",10,0,1,30 July 2000
American Beauty," This movie is like a calzone, all the perfect ingredients wrapped together.
","God this movie is terrific, this movie has inspired me with all of the following things:A) Handling my problemsB) Taking care of myselfC) Not taking s--t from peopleD) Wanting to be a better personThe razor-sharp wit, performances(Spacey especially), humor, drama, everything makes this movie just terrific. You should see this movie...I usually hate the movies that go to the Oscars, finding them extremely over-rated and boring(Chocolat). See this movie, it is great, anyone who doesn't like this movie, probably enjoys movies like 'Scary Movie 2', or is on serious drugs.",10,0,1,16 July 2001
54," Very sad.
","My age:14This movie is not sad because it has dramatic characters. It is sad that it wasted so much talent. 1. I do not like Ryan Phillipe or Neve Cambell. 2. Salma Hayeck has so much charm, yet she always picks the wrong roles. 3. Mike Myers is the only thing good about this film. 4. A woman's voice in the preview says 'written and directed by Mark Christopher', um he is nobody folks. Just a guy with a cool name. 5. The Wienstien's should have let Dimension Films(the crappier side of Miramax) release this one. Ouch it hurt. The characters are all boring, except for Mike Meyer's whose role took a back-seat position. Yargghh. Rent Boogie Nights instead, it's terrific. And has much more energetic camera work.",2,1,5,26 July 2000
Driven," Renny, you are god, get some better material
","I loved this movie because of Renny's direction alone. He makes the best loud bunch of debris. I payed to see this movie soley because Renny directed it, otherwise I would have stayed away. I hate Stallone, he needs to go to a speech therapist. This movie has a lame plot, but great racing scenes, and lots of good sound effects, hyper-editing, and girls in tight outfits. Estella Warren is so hot, Kip Pardue, you are a wimp, and need to pick roles that suit you better. Awesome direction, Lame plot.Brad",10,5,10,16 July 2001
Meet Joe Black," looks great.
","Well, hell this movie does look great. It has Dante Ferretti(Casino)'s production design, and Emmanuel Lubezki(Sleepy Hollow)'s gorgeous cinematography. But there is one problem that gets in the way of making this a good movie. Martin Brest's case of Kevin Costner-itis(The film runs for 3 hours) and it went through Ron Osborn and Jeff Reno(big mistake, writers of Radioland Murders). It should have just stayed with Kevin Wade(Working Girl) and Bo Goldman(Scent of a Woman). Another thing I would have done if I were Martin Brest is, he used two editors, His editor, Michael Tronick(Scent of a Woman) and Joe Hutshing(Jerry Maguire), to liven up the pace, I would have had the film re-chopped by the best editor on the planet, pace-jumper John Woo-editor Christian Wagner(Face/Off). The story is about Death who goes to take Anthony Hopkins, and oh, yeah, his daughter is one of the best looking things ever displayed on celluloid. So, he chills on earth, with Anthony Hopkins, and he shows him around. This movie is a great movie to look at, and considering Brad Pitt is one of my very favorite actors(I am a 15 year old male, who is heterosexual). This movie is not bad, just needs trimming. Great to look at. Rated PG-13(for thematic elements, language, and a sex-scene that will let you get a good night's sleep, trust me :-)",10,1,2,19 December 2000
