The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," OK, but without much content
","There is not much happening altogether in this film. They put way too much focus on the wedding and the honeymoon, thus wasting precious time. But I guess all those teenage girl fans wanted a full portrayal of the big romantic wedding.In all of the previous films, I liked the acting of most of the cast a lot. But in this film, everyone except Bella, Edward & Jacob is marginalised to such an extent that there cannot be much said about them. As an audience you just don't get to see enough of any of them to really develop a connection with or care about them.Altogether this is an OK addition to the franchise, by no means worse than the disappointing/confusing 2nd or 3rd films. I assume I will give this film either a 5 or a 6 (out of 10), but I think I will withhold my final vote until I have seen part 2. I know some might say that they are released as separate films and therefore should be treated as such, but as the original book is ripped into two halves here, I think it is fair to reserve the final judgement until I have seen the two films in conjunction (seeing that, as I haven't read the books, I will need to have seen both films in order to make sense of it all).",5,4,5,29 June 2012
Twilight," Decent genre film
","Taken on its own - i. e. taken as a stand-alone film and judged independently of the other films of the franchise - this is a decent film from the very specific 'Buffy'-genre: high-school/growing-up/vampire-love. The story holds up, and the acting (throughout the cast) is good to very good. It's more or less a 7.5 out of 10. But there are some weaknesses that make me withhold my ratings vote for the moment (for some further reflection). Some scenes of the film (e. g. the one with Edward and Bella on the mountain/meadow) are rather badly written and even worse directed. And as for the music: the score in this and other scenes is at times quite atrocious.",7,0,2,5 July 2012
The Twilight Saga: New Moon," OK, but confusing......
","Let's start by stating what this film had in common with the first one: quite decent acting on all fronts. What it didn't have was a common theme: it completely fell apart into two separate story-lines: 1) the Edward-Bella-Jake plot and Bella's suffering and her recuperation through her time spent with Jake. 2) the Volturi plotIn my view, it would never have been easy to seamlessly string those two together, but the way it was done in this film certainly didn't work. That being said, both plot-lines were decent, the first one more so.Were it for the first plot alone, I would probably give the film at least 6.5 out of 10, but I guess as a whole I'll rather end up nearer 5.5.....",6,0,5,5 July 2012
The Twilight Saga: Eclipse," Weakest part of the franchise?
","I'll start (again), by saying that the acting is good to very good throughout. That does exclude Pattinson and Samuel - both very good actors I'm sure - who seem both at a loss as to what their characters' motivations are. For Pattinson, it is evident throughout the franchise that he cannot find access to Edwards weird inner self. But in my opinion it is never more visibly obvious than in this third film. This is usually not really the fault of the actor - writers and/or directors are to blame for that. In Edward's case, I think it is fair to say that he is a rather badly written character. And Samuel seems to be at a similar problem with his character (Riley), though I am tempted to put the blame more on the directing than the writing in this case.As for the plot, there isn't much. It is all just one long preparation for the final battle scene. And the love triangle subplot is just a continuation from the second film. A judgement which one might extent to the whole film: it does at times seem a bit like an addendum to 'New Moon'.Although the film contains the most hilarious line of the whole franchise ('Doesn't he own a shirt?'), it also features the infamous 'I'm Switzerland'-line, a line so bad and so incongruous in that very scene that it even seems to throw Stewart of her game, as it is one of the very rare scenes in all of the films in which her acting seems to be sub-par.On the whole, I'd probably struggle to give this one more that a 5.5 out of 10. However, it does make a difference whether you view it as a stand-alone film, or whether you watch it in close succession with the other films (which is preferable).",6,3,5,6 July 2012
