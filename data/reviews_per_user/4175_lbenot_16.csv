Your Name.," Your Nuts!
","8.6 IMDb rating? All those cryptic glowing reviews? I was very suspicious, but we go to the movies once a week and saw everything else currently running so we gave in, bought our ticket and popcorn ($29.50) and hoped for some worthy movie entertainment. What we got was a really GOOFY story based on a fantasy premise which makes you wonder what the hell is going on - and involves a comet. You'll more or less figure it out by the end, but the annoying tedium of it all isn't worth the time or money. It will appeal to the anime cult, and those self-proclaimed esoteric types who enjoy claiming symbolic meaning in meaningless things.I use IMDb as a screening tool for selecting movies to invest my valuable time and money in, but all the ridiculous hype on this one clearly failed me. It's not the first time, and I increasingly find that perusing the 'Hated It' reviews is more useful in making a decision on what to see.",1,35,112,13 April 2017
Wind River," Bravo!
","A well-written and acted crime drama that told the all to common story of man's evil inhumanity to man, all set against the beauty of Wyoming's (Utah's) late winter back country. While plot centers around the Jeremy Renner role's unlikely involvement in unraveling and tracking of the crime, one of the subtle underlying themes this movie touches on is the long term effects of the historic mistreatment of the American reservation Indian, to include the current law enforcement 'jurisdictional nightmare' the was alluded to in the film and further explained in the IMDb 'Trivia' comments (be sure to read it).There can be no happy ending where the rape and murder of innocents is involved, but the conclusion did skillfully offer up a satisfying justice, and bit of redemptive hope for at least some of the survivors. A quality story-telling by a superb cast.",10,1,9,31 August 2017
The Irishman," The Dire-ish Man
","Slooooow, gloomy, melancholy, been-there-done-that, blandly and tediously played out, with all the requisite blood spatter, and by all the usual suspects. A director's cut release that begs a re-editing, Scorsese has met his waterloo. With Pacino mis-cast, and DiNiro's facial cgi and blue eyes a huge distraction, Pesci conjured up the most with what he was given. Thanks to Netflix we thankfully saved the price of theater admission, but whether seen at home or the theater, a dismal waste of 3 and a third entertainment hours.P.S. #1 Where was the technical adviser on the glaringly obvious 'here, it's the timing chain' goof? P.S. #2 Enjoyed the period look of all the film's locales, but while the period background vehicles were mostly correct, their always shiny, showroom condition spotlessness were not.",1,6,14,7 December 2019
The Hateful Eight," Movie Critic Snob-Bait
","I have come to learn there are is a small self-selected, very wordy/vocal group of 'special people' who rabidly believe that Movies should be made, sold and viewed solely to the measure of their own snobbish definition of 'Art,' as they alone define it (usually something us little people just can't understand/appreciate).But, the reality is that the other 99.9% of the people who buy the movie tickets that support the industry, simply pay to see: an entertaining, well told story. If it's done 'artistically' too, then both groups can be satisfied.While prior Tarantino films seemed to satisfy both the snobs and us regular folks, that which appeals most to the snobs in this film - the long unnecessarily drawn-out TEMPO, the 70mm hoop-la, and the extra gratuitously depicted violence and blood spatter - significantly reduced it's 'entertainment' value.His previous successes clearly afforded him a longer leash on this film (70mm?, 3 hours?), which satisfied the snobs at the expense of us regular folks.However, excellent casting (terrific ensemble of players) and acting by all (bravo again, Mr. Jackson, the Master of The Soliloquy), and a basically entertaining plot (a gory, western version of 'Bus Stop') cannot be denied.I'd like to see a 'Viewers Cut': Lop off the unnecessary hour or more, dial down all the unnecessary blood spatter (don't think it doesn't seep into the subconscious of all the borderline disturbed), and let 70mm rest in peace.",5,11,33,1 January 2016
Baby Driver," Worthy But Flawed
","Interesting plot premise, entertaining action scenes, appealing boy meets girl romance sub plot, and a plausible but weakly truncated ending, all weighted down by suddenly poor script-writing/story-development toward the middle of it all. Ensemble was well cast and, surprisingly, was able to see past Jon Hamm's 'Mad Men' typecasting in his portrayal of a convincing bad guy. Unfortunately, the Jamie Fox role was written with a little too much anger and didn't allow us to see at least a little bit of what he's best at.",6,2,6,24 August 2017
Dangal," Rare Entertainment!
","Everything a film should be, but very RARELY is: Entertaining. Just the right sprinkling of humor, inspiring, well-cast, well-acted, well- paced, well-edited - an absolute joy to watch as the story played out to it's conclusion. The wrestling competition scenes by these young girls were the most believable and realistic sports-action scenes I've seen in ANY movie. Sound track was very good. Subtitles were short and not a distraction to viewing the film at all, and oddly seemed to add to the overall impact and success of the film.The few photos of the family who lived this story, as the credits rolled, were a delight. As depicted in this film, there are aspects of the Indian culture and family values that are worth emulating. New Years Day theater was packed. Thank you to AMC for making this limited release gem available at one of your theaters in our area (only one!!?). It deserves a much wider release.",10,3,5,2 January 2017
Dunkirk," Tedious And Lacking
","While the true story and heroic efforts of the Dunkirk Evacuation deserve a 10, this movie does not. The worst of it was the droning, somber monotony of the musical soundtrack, particularly in the first portion of the movie, which has to be the most tediously overwrought score in history; followed by another heavy handed long section of a repetitively monotonous 4 or 5 note ascending minor scale, all of which was a serious and unfortunate detraction from the action on screen. One of the historically unique facts of this evacuation was the civilian fleet of nearly 400 small craft (Wikipedia) which heroically volunteered for this amazing feat, which I think was under-depicted. By the movie's end, it confirmed the senseless stupidity of geo-political wars and conflicts caused by governmental leaders, and the resulting senseless personal loss at the battle front. But faced with this senselessness, it also celebrated individual acts of bravery and sacrifice.Conspicuously and sadly absent was a written narrative at the end which summarized and brought into focus the huge scope of this historic evacuation, along with actual photographs.",5,9,14,11 August 2017
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Nope!
","Devoid of any plot, any meaningful storyline, and any skilled acting, the only redeeming value of this installment of Tarantino Giddy-Teen-Mentality Narcissism is the 1969 LA backdrop, which just in case you didn't notice it, is shoved in your face via a vintage neon sign montage toward the end of this are-we-there-yet trip to nowhere.Poor DiCaprio, struggling to pull it all off, to most notably include his cutting-room-floor-worthy scene of trailer rage; Pitt, just happy just to beefcake his way through yet another movie on his way to the bank; and most regrettably, poor Pacino and Dern . . .A ridiculously long 2-3/4 hours of one disjointed, clumsy, cringe-worthy scene after another. It certainly isn't art, and other than watching that white, windows-down '66 Coupe De Ville wheel around town, it isn't entertainment.",1,14,26,2 August 2019
Hidden Figures," Hidden Role Models
","Movies based on the remarkable life stories of real people are often a treat, and this one was no exception. The early jump-forward-in-time clunky scenes of their car broken down along a highway, and then driving just a few feet behind a speeding police car were curiously poor choices; and the early scenes setting up the overt discrimination that existed at that time were mechanically sledge-hammered into the story line - for any in the audience who never heard about it or forgot about it (?). A more cohesive screenplay for the fist portion of the film would have earned it a 10. Fortunately the story telling gets better and the lives of these three very bright and important women begins to be told. The central and inspirational theme of this film is that in the face of not only racial discrimination but being female as well, each took pro-active, productive steps to self-improve their standing in life. One taught herself Fortran computer language from a book; another petitioned and won the court's approval; and another used her training, skill and persistence to become an important part of the success of early NASA space flight. Rather than doing nothing and demanding respect, they got busy and EARNED it. A timeless real-life example and message for people of any race or gender.The real-life pictures and life updates as the credits rolled at the end of the film were the icing on the cake.P.S. The flip-side antithesis to 'Fences.'",8,4,16,11 January 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy," Guardians of . . Pure Entertainment!
","Movie escapism at its best! An excellent balance of action, visual effects, dialog, and clever humor. The ongoing interaction amongst the RICHLY distinct and diverse physio-personalities of the lead characters was the KEY, well-conceived and written element of this film, as was the welcome fact that it never took itself too seriously.The dialog of each of the lead characters was carefully and cleverly crafted to help further define their unique physical individuality (i.e., Groot was a wonderfully understated charmer, the raccoon a gregarious hoot).The (fortunately) brief opening scene was weak, stiff and mechanical in it's effort to set up the lead character's plot line, and could have/should have been done better so as not to be such a disservice to the well-done entertainment that follows.Pure entertainment, and then some!",10,1,2,9 August 2014
The Shape of Water," The Sad Shape of Moviemaking
","While the basic premise of this King Kong-ish plot, the lead acting (with the exception of the stereotypical and WAY overplayed villain), and the recreation of the 60's time period are all somewhat worthy (three stars worth), there are many oddly-forced and clunky scenes all of which impede the storytelling flow and represent a serious distraction: Gratuitous gore (rotting fingers, headless kitty), homosexual innuendo, masturbation, a bathroom that will hold 7 feet of water by simply closing the door and putting a towel under it, inter-species love at first sight sexual attraction and off-screen consummation, and a Saturday-Night-Live-like song and dance skit (?), among several others. Even with the love-conquers-all 'happy ending' and a beautifully depicted submerged in water embrace final scene,' overall it doesn't digest well.P.S. The shill-like adoration of just the titles alone (!) of most of the 10/10 user ratings for this film are absurdly hilarious, their effusively giddy text even more so.",3,590,1109,22 December 2017
The Secret Life of Pets," The Secret STRIFE of Pets
","The previews and the first five and the last five minutes or so of the movie were written with charming and comedic wit. Everything in-between was horribly written. Sadly, it quickly becomes nothing more than a cheap, unimaginative Saturday morning throwaway cartoon filled with violence and anger. The characters, the plot, and the dialogue are just awful - for any age group. Plot features a large group of angry, hoodlum runaway pets who revel in stories of retribution against there evil owners - who allegedly discarded them all. There's actually a pivotal scene where to gain acceptance to this group of gang-bangers, our hero is encouraged to recount the details of how he killed his awful owner! REALLY! Come to find out the gang leader was never discarded at all - his owner just died of old age. HOW DOES THIS KIND OF CRAP GET RELEASED?? But, far worse than having to pay to sit through this lost entertainment opportunity is the fact that the unnecessary evil portrayed and the total lack of positive role modeling this movie offers up, has and will be viewed and digested by millions of young minds.",1,7,36,27 July 2016
Arrival," 'Encounters . .. ' and 'The Day The Earth Stood Still' on Steroids
","While good movies entertain and lift the spirit, this one does much more: It memorizes. This fabulously intriguing plot is slowly revealed in two chronologies, one told/acted-out in real-time, the other by way of flashes of visions our protagonist begins to have after having contact with the newly arrived aliens she has been summoned by the government to try to communicate with. It's cleverly left up to the viewer to stay engaged and slowly make sense of it all.The alien creatures and their method of communicating is exquisitely conceived and visually portrayed, as is their own alien 'humanity.'The portrayal of how various world leaders react to the alien arrival, and how these leaders interact with each other is a sadly accurate commentary, as were the scenes of the media riff-raff stirring up angry and violent sentiment.One point deduction: The too oft repeated mother daughter scenes were gratuitously sappy, were an unnecessary distraction, and didn't add value to the story. One of the very few movies that earns/begs a repeat viewing for full comprehension.A masterpiece? Perhaps.",9,1,6,17 November 2016
Jojo Rabbit," Oddly Interesting, But Unworthy Of A 10
","A few powerfully dramatic moments, some gifted acting by most but not all, a bizarre subplot which featured anachronistically humorous dialog, all seasoned by an odd and equally anachronistic soundtrack that detracted far more than it added. All together noteworthy and quirky, but far from all the IMDb 10's that will encourage many to see it.",4,6,22,15 November 2019
Lucy," LUdiCrous-Y
","Poor Scarlett. Poor Morgan. This ridiculous movie demeans your otherwise wonderful body of work. Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, meets The Matrix, meets 2001 A Space Odyssey, meets a 70's era rock concert light show, all in a silly way.The far fetched plot was fine (Asian badguys, the fight over control of a new mind-enabling drug, the effects of achieving superduper brain power), but the screenplay, gratuitous blood-spatter, and directorial choices/vision were horrible.The montage inclusion of scenes from Africa and of the prehistoric 'Lucy' were goofy piled-on attempts at trying to infuse 'heavy' meaning into what is, in the end, a sad self-indulgent directorial soliloquy.",1,2,10,10 September 2014
Sully," With Reality Like This, Who Needs Fiction!
","Of course, I knew of The Miracle on the Hudson and of it's hero, Sully, but not of the subsequent half-baked governmental finger-pointing this movie so skillfully portrays.Because the investigation was conducted-in/released-to the public, I assume the climatic scene toward the end of the movie - in which Sully himself a crash investigator, publicly exposes the flaw in the board's analysis which wrongly faulted him with an error in judgment - was accurately portrayed. If it was, Sully's calm restraint and eloquence in his own defense has earned even more of my respect and admiration for him.Other personal aspects of the miraculous event are explored and portrayed in a well-balanced non-sappy manner: the immediate media crush on Sully and his family that resulted; his instant popularity; the mental trauma that resulted in it's aftermath; the importance of having a good co-pilot and crew; the steady, modest and grounded manor of our hero; and of course, the gratitude of the survivors.A jazz pianist himself, the understated Eastwood-composed musical score added just the right mood at the right times; and the gifted Hanks again showed us why he earns these types of important and iconic roles.It's rare for a film to inform, entertain, and inspire or uplift all at the same time; but the fine screenplay, acting, and directorial choices of this one - not the least of which is the as-the-credits-roll brief appearance of real-life Sully and some of the actual water-landing (not crash!) survivors all reunited along side the actual plane (now in a museum) - landed them all!",10,1,2,15 September 2016
