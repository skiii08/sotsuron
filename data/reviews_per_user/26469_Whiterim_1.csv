Spartacus," The Best Movie I've Ever Seen
","I have seen well over a thousand movies in my life and Spartacus is the best I've seen by far. Unlike Gladiator which it is compared to, Spartacus does a great job in developing the characters in the movie. While Kirk Douglas did a masterful job, Lawrence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, Jean Simmons, et al, gave masterful renditions. The climactic battle may have lacked the enthusiasm of the opening battle sequence in Gladiator, but the dramatic approach of the Roman legions on the field of battle was breath taking, particularly with the dramatic music score by Alex North.I've seen this movie at least 10 times and intend to see it another 10 or more.",10,4,9,4 May 2005
