Changeling," by far the best work of Clint Eastwood
","This is, reportedly, a so called 'true' story. That probably means that it at least is somewhat true. That little truth stretches a long way, however, and the story finds relevancy even today. It points out the simple truth, that if you are criminal it's much easier to be that if, at the same time, you are the police. In fact, it is such a nice set up, that all of us should always be on the lookout for it, regardless of which country we live in or, expressed somewhat differently, we ought to suspect foul play if the police is never accused, because that means that the crooks have expanded their realm and have the media in their pockets as well. Not so in this picture. There is a reverend here that has broad access to the media, seemingly even better access than the police. That's always a good thing. In a country in which the police is often accused in the media and occasionally brought down, there is always hope for at least some justice. You see, this is what this good film makes me think of. We may look at this film and say 'yes, these were the dark ages' (the story takes place in the twenties and thirties) but we might just as well say 'yes, these were the days of justice, when the police could be convicted'. And there is a good swift kick at psychiatry as well.",9,3,4,18 June 2009
The Expendables 2," i guess some are dumb enough to buy this
","Like me, I bought it for Jason Statham but this is far below his standards. Some hundred guys or more get killed because they think that the US should not have all the plutonium - that's the story, more or less. The rest is a buddy-film of and for men far beyond their fifties but in good shape though like they are doing nothing but to keep in shape. And they are because surely they are not thinking. I still have some hope for Jason though, who looks a little shy and embarrassed in this film. It's entertaining if you like seeing things and people being blown to bits but if you're tired of that - stay away! It makes me wonder what these guys do on their spare-time. Surely they are not preparing for the revolution. No, I think that they like things as they are and like, more or less, naughty boys they blunder through the landscape without a worry in the world. Ga-ga do-do bums!",3,1,4,3 June 2013
Source Code," war against terrorism destroys every option for good film
","A young man is caught in limbo (= in religions the state between death and rebirth) and used for the war against terrorism. Now, the prospect of somebody caught in limbo or something similar was used in 'dark star' by John Carpenter and that film showed what could be done with such a concept. This film however, is a totally different matter. Even beyond death this poor soul is haunted by lackeys with the gibberish 'war on terror' -bs. Nowhere it is pronounced that only the most powerful nation on earth could be said to engage in any terror. Of course not, because this is by no means a 'leftist' film and instead a film for idiots. Vance Packard once wrote that the American society defended the right of the businessman to seek out the morons and make them still more moronic. This film seems to work along these lines. I had to write this review only because the film had received such good rating on IMDb. This shenanigans must be stopped!",1,46,94,6 April 2011
Argo," seriously damaged by unnecessary suspense
","The run against the clock or simultaneous events is a cheap trick of thrills and any serious movie should refrain from it. Unfortunately, this movie does not. Did it happen exactly as told in the end - of course not! This is for the extra unnecessary expense - a lot of running and chasing and idiocy. Those who look through it are just embarrassed and the rating of this film on IMDb will drop considerably in the future. And this is really sad, because the movie starts out real good with a more honest account of historical events than ever produced in a movie of this size before. That honesty was the reason why I kept looking on the film and the action idiocy in the end almost made me turn off the damned thing. This could have been a great film if it had stayed true, even if just poetically with maybe invented stories that would have illuminated still further the problems involved. But that was not to be. Instead we got that ridiculous running against time action. Pity.",5,3,6,27 October 2012
Creed," just another glorification for competition
","This is just the thing that is rotten with the so called 'American way of Life'. You could forgive the very first Rocky-film, because, although it was about competition, it was also about a Young man with abysmal prospects in Life grabbing the one chance he had for a better Life. That film did not necessarily glorify competition. You could even say that it was critical of a society, who gives a man no other option to better himself than to send Another man to kingdom come.After so many Rocky-films now past, there is now so such excuse. It's all about knocking out the other guy even if the score in the end may read differently.Jesus Words 'Love each other' has nothing to do with the American society, which I prefer to call 'the swingy', since it produces swines and not human beings.",2,32,64,3 December 2015
About Time," forgot about groundhog day?
","20 years Before this film was done, there was Groundhog Day. That film had an almost religious following. It only had one person Everything happening to and there was only one day which was lived over and over again until that perfect day, which, i Believe, was the reason for the religious following.
This film blunders through a similiar topic 20 years later and the only thing that's been added is a s-tload of stupidity.",2,0,4,16 June 2019
Shutter Island," propaganda - abominable choice, Mr. Scorsese
","In a book or a film, which is not there in order to instruct, but instead there to enlighten and construct - in such books and films, authority must never be right! In the propaganda-film, authority is always right and something to be trusted, not questioned. Furthermore, a film or book that cannot be generalized as an example for something can be described as a case-study, which, together with many other case-studies, can give rise to an interesting new theory with a possible general usefulness. A single case-study is however only interesting if it overthrows an existing theory and this film does not. On the contrary. This film (case-study) does instead glamorize existing authority.In the other films by the same author, Gone Baby Gone and Mystic River, we find the same abominable tendencies as in this film. Generalized as propaganda, Gone Baby Gone, leads us to believe that missing children are taken care of by better parents and Mystic River insidiously tries to tell us that we shouldn't feel to bad about doing wrong against the forsaken, since their lives are f-d up anyway (hinting closing-scenes in Mystic River).Of course, it is not difficult to be published as an author with this kind of content in your writing. Machiavelli managed to let the whole thing go 'over the top' in his 'The Prince', so that we today can read his book as a revelation of what power is all about, while he, in his day and with some courage, managed to sell as praise what in fact was its very opposite. This author's work does not go 'over the top' however and what can be learned from it is only abominable, if you allow such 'learning' to take place.The word is again 'fascism', which is the idea that an elite of humans should be allowed to govern the vast majority as they, the elite, see fit and if you have a lot of money and/or power, you are a member of the club and you then publish whatever enhances your chances to stay in power, like works that defend authority.",1,18,39,23 February 2010
Incendies," what a mess!
","From beginning to end this film is a mess. Who would write in her/his will that their Children should endanger themselves to find out what does not have to be found out since it is already known?
How can anybody be so completely stupid to film a script like this?
The imdb-users know nothing about film - that is obvious - or they would never have given this film more than one star.
It must be tough to do anything with a crowd like that determining what is good and what is bad.",1,4,11,10 July 2019
Scott Pilgrim vs. the World," warning, this is horror!
","If this is appealing to many of the youths today, it explains more than I care to know about. What a horror of propaganda! Is there any films about youths today which do not dwell on homosexuality? There has been no serious debate upon this in society - just more or less tired acceptance of it all. Once it was forbidden, then it was suddenly wanted behavior and there was no debate in between. To be sure, at least so do I think, society should not interfere in what goes on between consenting adults. To love somebody of your own sex is always better than no love at all. Nobody should have to feel ashamed or miserable about it. But to have to propagate it like something desirable? I think that needs to be debated and this film does not do that. It just invites to swallow it all like all the other lies you are made to swallow. This is very tiring indeed.",1,3,19,17 June 2017
Drive," if not for the ending, it would have been a 10
","The point with Point Blank was that one man can make a big difference. Now, physically, I am not that man, for sure. In my imagination I could however create such a man and in the beginning of this film towards the very end, you think that you are dealing with such a man in this film. Then, alas, comes the end and everything hits the fan, so to speak.Why can't we have the straightforward story of a man who is that fraction faster than other men and, taking so much more responsibility than other men, goes out and cleans up, so to speak.It hasn't happened as far as we know but would we know if it had happened on a smaller scale at least? Maybe it cannot happen but if so then it is because there exists some secret weapon that only the extremely rich have access to and which protects them from the lone assassin ever reaching them.A female physicist claimed that the evaporation of the twin towers was done involving a totally new science that is popular known only in its beginnings and that the airplanes were virtual and non-existent and that the real and most important message of 9-11 was that 'look what we got - you better not mess with us'.Well, maybe that's a little too much out of target for this film, which message though is not much less depressing.",Null,0,6,13 November 2011
Hero," abominable
","When the swedish prime-minister returned from a visit to China he blabbed about 'stability' and almost gave he chinese government a total understanding for the events on the square of heavenly peace (or whatever the square is called where courageous chinese citizens met their death when opposing the rule of the few over the many). So does this film. Spoilers ahead. Hitler and Napoleon dreamt of the same thing as did the first ruler of China but unlike him they did not succeed in their folly. It may be a sign of our present times that fascists go unnoticed. Now, for those who do not know what fascism is then let me illuminate You on the subject, so that You may better understand this film: Fascism is an ideology which claims the right for a supposed elite amongst men to rule over the rest of mankind. With tearful beauty this film defends this idea. Under the breathtaking grandiose scenery it presents, the most disgusting ideology mankind has ever dreamt up is buried. We follow the 'hero' through his ordeals in order to assassinate the evil one, only to see him in the end succumb to that same person for his megalomaniac plan equal to any Hitler or Napoleon. The 'noble' emperor exclaims that the reason for him attacking other kingdoms is only to unite the many so that there will be 'peace in the valley'. But what could be worse than peace under oppression? This question does not even occur in this abomination of a film, beautiful on the outside and grizzly in the inside.",1,5,12,15 April 2003
Lincoln," On our path to decency, this film cannot be blamed for being.
","I am a Swede and so a 'foreigner' to the people of America. In practice I have as little to be proud of that fact as any people for in my country as in all other countries today slavery is not abolished. It has simply become 'wage-slavery'. Compared to open slavery there is however a little difference. You cannot as easily kill a wage-slave as a slave that is your property. You can as easily starve a wage-slave and make his or her life as miserable as any slave's but you cannot go forth and simply openly kill a wage-slave as easily as a slave which is your property.To most foreigners there is a mystery about Americans, especially poor Americans. How could they ever vote Republican? This movie provides no answer to that question and does instead add another question: 'How can a poor person ever vote Democrat?'.As the example of the Soviet Union clearly demonstrates Communism or Socialism is not the final answer to Capitalism. They are however failed steps in the right direction. We must find other steps in that right direction of abolishing all kinds of slavery.What did all the poor people of the South fight for in the civil war, one might ask. That is the same American mystery as stated above. The answer provided so far to us 'foreigners' is that they fought for the American dream, which means to be a millionaire before the age of thirty, by any means possible, one might ad. In competition with others, which means as much as animosity to others when you come down to it, you are supposed to get that million and that abominable action is worth dying for? Is that America? Yes, so it seems.Communism and Socialism, when set in practice, did not abolish competition. Their theories were not strong enough to hinder a malpractice but these theories were not as silly as 'competition at all costs'.So far, Anarchism has never been tried and maybe there are other 'isms' out there that could maybe be tried. We must not give up and even if it is not plausible that we will survive if we continue with capitalism - that is really not the question. Abomination should never survive and if the species 'human' finds no other way than that, then that species belongs exterminated and we should not grief its demise.So, how do we arrive at 'total material equality' as a first step to decency, because that is what it all boils down to for the present. Can you see your most hated enemy having the right to never stand before you with 'hat in hand' begging? Can you do that, then you are ready for a life in decency.",5,1,6,8 January 2013
The Artist," The Emperor's New Cloths???
","Is this an invitation to re-score silent movies? If so, then good show! But it isn't, is it? No, in spite of good acting and dancing, this is fluff and no more than that. From the first frame to the last totally predictable.I guess the hype derives from the fact that only few people look at silent movies nowadays. The originals, such as The Crowd, Sunrise and City Lights and, why not, Safety Last or The Mark of Zorro are all far better and far less predictable.If this film catches your interest for the old silent films then it has done more than you could have expected from it, I guess.",3,6,19,23 January 2012
Groundhog Day," Maybe the only unintended masterpiece in film history
","It is said that this film has gotten an almost religious following of admirers and rightfully so.It was intended as just another comedy with Bill Murray as star. Perhaps sometime during the shooting, the director or somebody else may have suspected that it was more than so but much more than a suspicion it was apparently not.It is funny to be sure but below all fun there lies something deadly serious that was not intended but that nevertheless pulls through and leaves the spectator with a sense of awe for every day of life we are given on earth.You could simply state that it is about the limitless possibilities in the single moment or the eternity in a single day and that, if we were allowed to live fully and not as slaves to a murderous few, then a life-span of only 70 or 60 years or even less would be fully sufficient to complete our time on earth. The former thought is more likely religious and the latter more likely revolutionary but they are both possible to be induced when seeing this masterpiece of a film, that was never intended or expected to become just that.",10,4,9,17 June 2012
Pretty Woman," Maybe the most sickening lie ever told.
","Ken Russel made 'Whore' as a reaction on this movie.All in all, it is a movie which was done because someone found out that there was money to make on injured women, making them feel 'good' and 'experienced' over the sexual abuse they had been lured into by their vanity. You could also see the film as a commercial for prostitution. Cynically, you might agree that it's preferable to get money for the abuse instead of giving it away, but that is not the point that the movie makes, unfortunately. It's basically a Cinderella-story but 'Cinderella' in this case is a thoroughly used one and the prince is a moron. If all rich people were like him, then there would be no rich people. But, again, it is not the point of this movie to make you think that. No, no. The rich are all good and they all marry whores and yet they manage to keep their money and grace. If you believe that, you believe anything!",1,58,111,27 October 2001
The Reader," touches upon two topics, one of them it does not quite dare to follow through
","First a little lesson in order for you to understand this review. It concerns minorities in a society of power. In order to gain and maintain power, masonries were created through history. The idea of a masonry was a kind of conspiracy against the rest of society. The members of the masonry helped each other when times were rough, so that for nobody of them times was ever as rough as those who had no organization to help them, like the majority of people. The masonry of course also helped each other to positions in society, so that if one member reached a high position he quickly used his influence to put other members of the masonry in as high positions as he was capable of furnishing. Skilled members of a masonry were preferred, especially in starting up a masonry, but the better the masonry worked the more it could do with less skilled members as long as absolute loyalty was ensured. In fact, if there was a choice between a member less skilled but more loyal a member more skilled but less loyal, the former was preferred. Masonries can be describes as 'created minorities'. If you already belong to a minority, you don't have to create a masonry. Provided that the minority you belong to like each other better than the surrounding majority and provided the minority is not persecuted by the surrounding majority, you will have a functioning masonry and the minority you belong to will slowly, sometimes quickly, rise to power in a power-society. Now, if we take the blacks in USA. They do not rise to power and the reason is simple: they are persecuted, not openly of course, since that is against the law, but insidiously all the time. There is always some excuse for not letting more of them reach power than a certain quota which is needed in order to seem non-racist. If it was not so, then blacks would have more positions in power than whites because that is the inevitable consequence of masonry. Another reason for the failure of the blacks to reach power is that they are easily recognizable and so would easily ignite a racism if there were too many of them in power. Not so with Jews, for instance, who are so like other whites that the Nazis were forced to put a David-star on them in order not to confuse them with other whites. Between masonry and non-masonry there is a vast landscape of 'buddies', 'contacts' and what not. They all have the same purpose: to gain and maintain power. That's the way it is.The majority of people are always poor and far from having any influence in society. Those are the ones that are being toyed with as with, for instance, the poor woman in this film. All she is left with is doing a good job as employee. She is fragile and has very little self-esteem and would it become common knowledge that she cannot even read, she would rather kill herself than letting this happen. It is made clear in the film that it wasn't inability, like dyslexia, that made her an illiterate, so the only other choice we have is extreme poverty or abuse in childhood as an explanation.Who has most guilt in a war and/or a holocaust? The profiteer, who makes money on it or the poor person who is left with the dirty work? Knowing how dementia has grown strong in society in later years, I allow myself to state the obvious (which this film doesn't, by the way, probably because the makers think that people are less dumb than I think that they are): You have as much guilt for anything as you have influence to change that thing. The extremely poor have practically no guilt and the extremely rich have practically all guilt. When those with all the guilt sit to judge over those with no guilt - then shame has over-crossed every conceivable boundary.In the end, the guilt-ridden story-teller visits a rich Jewess in the USA. She was not a direct victim but bears a cross for all family-members that were killed in the holocaust. She doesn't see that she is a profiteer of the events, belonging to a minority which, after the war, had no difficulty whatsoever to reach power-positions in society - the persecution was gone and replaced by its opposite and you can easily claim that after the war, being Jewish was the same as belonging to an augmented masonry.This film is a story of rich and poor and how, once again, the poor are pointed out as the bad guys and the rich as the innocent. The film does take a stand for the poor but that stand you will have to look for a little. That's one topic. The other topic is the crushed self-esteem of the poor. So many of them are left with so little of it, that they cling on to it even when facing death. This is another great topic, totally deserving a film of its own.",9,0,1,4 December 2009
Lucy," 9 out of 10 scoring for just posing the question
","Bad Reviews of this film based on the fact that it avoids moral questions are legitimate bad Reviews. The film does avoid moral problems.However, the film does explore the human mind and the intersection between Morgan Freeman making a speech and the action taking Place is much in the same way as Henri Laborit making his speech in 'Mon Oncle d'Amerique', the film by Alain Resnai. It does not disturb me at all - on the contrary! The question of what happens if humans would access more of their brain capacity does resemble a parable of what happens if humans became God. This might have been unintended by the makers of this Movie but it is nevertheless a fair comparison that can be made.The action scenes with all the killings and whatnot are for pure Entertainment, of course, and brings a relaxation from the very Heavy topic here concerned.Therefore, it would be unfair to dismiss this Movie as bad. How many Movies today pose philosophical questions. Matrix did for sure but how many more? A similar Movie with morals being the central issue would, of course, be most commendable but could such a Movie be made and would it be financed. Probably not, since it would rip our capitalistic World into shreds and leave nothing of it to be salvaged and who would finance something like that? So far, we will have to be content with that there are films being made that stimulate our thinking and hope that this take us to the journey towards absolute material equality, the very basic of all morals as far as we now can detect.",9,1,4,31 August 2015
Star Wars: Episode VII - The Force Awakens," senile film in senile times
","The story is basically the same as in the first Star Wars but what was good with the first Star Wars that was made was not the story, which was on the level of a bad Punch and Judy show, and instead the philosophical content that shone through here and there and, of course, the presence of Alec Guinness.Here, the bathwater is kept and the baby is thrown out. It's a senile film for senile times, looking much the same at the face of it but having nothing inside with which you can make Contact.Yes, we are living in senile times, living as if we had learned nothing. The same murderous bunch of scoundrels are in charge but the protests are directed elsewhere. People join them because they are convinced that 'Hey, you only live once so try to have as much fun as possible no matter the corpses you have to climb over to get there'.The same good and evil is fighting in this film since the evil was never erased allowing for a higher polarity of good and evil esteeming from the good that was left but could not be realized as long as the lower polarity was allowed to go on.Total material equality - that is the next step, not this garbage.",1,64,97,23 December 2015
The Martian," you have to go as far as mars to find a brave American
",In times when Americans sit in bunkers directing drones to kill  Children it's a bit much to see a film about American heroism.  Ridley Scott seems to specialize in this sort of mumbo. We still  remember with horror Black Hawk Down when we are met with this sticky  piece of mars-hmallow film. There was more gumshoe in his brother who  after all brought us Enemy of the State.  I Think Americans did well in instead turn their vision towards the  homeless around them that are piling up around them and maybe do a film  about true heroism.  This is not it and I'm not surprised that you have to go as far as Mars  to find a decent American in these times of abomination.,1,25,60,6 October 2015
