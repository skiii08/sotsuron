Source Code," Best movie of the year.
","This movie was AMAZING, so many twists. This have to be one of my favorite movies of all time! I didn't know what to except when I started watching it but oh my god, I'm in love with this movie. If you haven't seen it go get it RIGHT now. You'll love it. I can't stress enough how wonderful this movie is. It has a perfect blend of story and excitement. The actors are great and the plot is just down right genius. I'd defiantly recommend this movie to everyone I talk to. I honestly had no idea what the movie was going to be about, I just saw it and decided to get it. This movie leaves you thinking, I felt like I didn't know what was right anymore after watching.",10,0,1,22 April 2011
