Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It´s just a movie
","'Episode I - The Phantom Menace' was almost hyped to death when it came out, and when I look back I realize it was a bit foolish to expect it to be as good as the other three. I´m a huge fan of 'Star Wars', 'The Empire Strikes Back' (my favorite) and 'The Return Of The Jedi', and therefore I wanted this to be as good as them. Of course, I became slightly disappointed with 'Episode I' and realized that it´s, after all, just a movie.As everybody know, the story takes place before the other ones and is the first episode of the classic saga. But somehow I think something is missing when the very beginning involves a taxation dispute between the federations. I would have preferred a prologue which explained how the Jedi Clan and the Sith Clan were born, and how the whole galaxy came to be! A bit like the prologue they had in 'The Fellowship Of The Ring', if you catch my drift.
Dialogue has never been George Lucas´ strong side, and here it´s worse than ever. The story isn´t that good either, with slow pacing and it also lacks really spectacular scenes. 'The Pod Race' feels extremely drawn-out and something put there only for the very young. The new environments are nowhere near awesome planets like the icy Hoth or the swampy Dagobah.
The actors looked good on paper, but only Liam Neeson and Pernilla August manages to bring warmth to their characters. Ewan McGregor is a disappointment as Obi-Wan Kenobi and Jake Lloyd is an unbearably irritating child actor. But one can´t really expect them to perform any miracles with these lines... And then we have the hopeless CGI-characters, i.e. Watto, Boss Nass and Jar Jar Binks. The knowledge that Binks will appear in the next episode scares me. The only new characters I really liked were Darth Maul (and he won´t appear in any more Star Wars-movies, darn) and those cute little battle droids who got smashed up by the Jedis all the time. Their chess-computer voices were just wonderful!If you don´t compare this to the other movies (but then again, who won´t?) this is actually endurable enough. The action scenes are exciting, especially the sword fights which looks better than ever. Lucas and his men have obviously been ambitious with the movie, and it shows. And since the wrap-up is so nicely made, I actually believe Lucas can fix his band-wagon up for 'Episode II - The Attack Of The Clones'. I just hope I won´t be disappointed again.3/5",7,0,1,2 January 2002
Training Day," One of this year´s biggest sleeper-hits
","In 'Training Day', we get to follow young cop Jake Hoyt on his (you guessed it) training day, the day that will decide if he is cut out to be in the narcotic departments, where he so badly wants to be. But his supervisor turns out to be a nightmare, and Jake´s training day becomes a day full of hell.'Training Day' turned out to be a real surprise for me, as I wasn´t expecting anything special when I walked into the cinema. But it turned out to be one of the better cop-thrillers I have ever seen, with a script that contains many surprises.The acting is first class all the way. I wouldn´t be surprised if Denzel Washington gets another Oscar nomination, because here he really shines. It´s different from most of his other work, but he´s very confident and believable when he is teaching the viewers the 'law of the street' with that lovely accent. Ethan Hawke makes an nice comeback, after a few tough years with not many films worth seeing. Oldies´ like Tom Berenger, Scott Glenn and Harris Yulin have small but important roles, and it´s fun to see artists like Macy Gray and Snoop Doggy Dog in cameos. The director portrays the ghetto with an interesting touch, and the story is strong and shocking at times.The ending feels unnecessary violent and something that´s there to please the action fans, who might have trouble to cope with the rather slow pace at times. But all in all, 'Training Day' is a rock-solid cop-movie.4/5",8,1,11,28 December 2001
Memento," Unlike anything you´ve ever seen
","'Memento' is definitely a different experience. Don´t worry about anybody giving the ending away, because in 'Memento' that´s where the story begins.
Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man that has a short-term memory loss, he can´t remember things that happened only moments ago. That´s why he takes pictures of everyone he gets involved with, and make tattoos all over his body, so that he can remember who he can trust. He does this because his wife has been murdered, and he is determined to track down the killer for vengeance...As hinted above, the story in 'Memento' is told backwards, it begins with the ending and ends with the beginning. It might sound that you can get lost rather easy here, but luckily the whole concept is easier than it sounds to follow. And what a brilliant one it is.Newcomer Christopher Nolan is clearly a director to watch in the future, he has created one of the most original movies in a very long time, and it´s a very good one too. The acting is also great, Guy Pearce is remarkably good in the leading role. This man is clearly smart when it comes to picking jobs. Carrie-Anne Moss is as brilliant as she is beautiful and Joe Pantoliano more and more stands out as one of the most underrated actors today.'Memento' has an intriguing story, and the whole backwards-concept makes it even more enjoyable. This is one of those movies which might get better each time you watch them. That´s why I simply can´t wait to see this one again.5/5",10,0,1,2 January 2002
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," One of the best movies ever made
","From the very first frame I was hooked. Starting with an excellent prologue that tells the story of the Ring and how it finally turned up in the hands of Bilbo Baggins. And we´re also told that evil once again is moving, and then we cut to one of the most beautiful pictures I´ve ever seen. Frodo sitting under a tree in the Shire, waiting for Gandalf. So incredibly beautiful.The tale about the famous Ring has been read by so many, and now the first movie is finally here. It remains pretty faithful to the book, although the whole Tom Bombardill-part has been rightfully cut out. Some characters have also swapped places, everything to the movie´s advantage. It rarely feels slow, and the length is perfect. Luckily, the book´s few women Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) have been given more screen-time here.Peter Jackson certainly did a smart move when he picked his homeland New Zeeland as camping ground for his masterpiece. The country has everything the movie needs and I don´t think I´ve ever seen such beautiful landscapes. Jackson also proves that he is a superb director when it comes to both emotional dialogue and intense action bits. The casting is probably the best I´ve ever seen, all the actors fit their roles without any flaws. Elijah Wood simply IS Frodo and Sir Ian McKellen sets the tone perfectly for Gandalf. The relatively unknown actors who portrays the other Hobbits are great, and so are old favorites of mine, Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean as Aragorn respectively Boromir. And there is no doubt that Orlando Bloom will be a superstar, after his awesome turn as cool elf Legolas. But the movie´s most touching performance has to be credited to Ian Holm, as Bilbo Baggins. Perfect casting.'The Fellowship of the Ring' simply has everything, and if there is any justice in the world it will bag just as many awards at this years Oscars, like 'Titanic' did a few years ago. I suggest that the Best Director award should go to Peter Jackson, Best Supporting Actor to Ian Holm, Best Actor to Sir Ian McKellen and, of course, Best Film to the movie itself. I´ve already seen it twice and I can´t wait to see it again. Not only the best movie of 2001, but one of the best I´ve ever seen!5/5",10,0,0,2 January 2002
Cast Away," Absolutely fantastic!
","Tom Hanks plays a man who works for Fed-Ex, and he is always concerned about the time. He says that the time is his worst enemy, but he will soon think otherwise. On a business trip his plane crashes somewhere over the Atlantic, and he is washed ashore a remote island. He tries to think over the situation and decides to attempt on leaving the island. But soon he realize that he will spend a long time here. And back home is girlfriend is waiting for him to come home, like he promised he would.I just have to say that this movie was fantastic! It´s totally different from anything else I´ve ever seen. And Tom Hanks is, as always, awesome. After a rather slow first half hour, things gets interesting as we see Hanks arrive at the island. There are no dialogue whatsoever for long periods, which feels nice. It wouldn´t as interesting as it is, if Hanks crashed along with a friend, or something. Now he´s completely on his own, and it´s very enjoyable to watch Hanks trying to survive. The director, Robert Zemeckis, has found the exactly right tone, and the movie never gets boring, well at least not on the island. 'Cast Away' is beautifully shot, with majestic environments and all. The film´s score is superb, it touches the heart exactly in the right moments.
As I mentioned above, Hanks is great. He is one of my favorite actors, and I must say that his performance is one of the best he has ever made. Helen Hunt has a rather small part, but she does a fine job with it.
And in the end, even I had problems with keeping the tears away. 'Cast Away' is THAT good. If you enjoy the tv-show 'Survivor' but want something a bit deeper, this is perfect. Great movie!* * * * ½",9,0,0,23 October 2001
The Mummy Returns," Bigger doesn´t certainly mean better
","In the sequel to the very successful summer-hit of 1999 'The Mummy', director Stephen Sommers has made everything bigger and, according to himself, better. I can´t say that I agree with 'The Mummy Returns' being better than its predecessor, but this is still fun stuff.Several years after their first adventure, Rick and Evelyn are back in Egypt to hunt for treasures. This time they have their ingenious son with them. After some trouble, they get home to London, but they´ve brought something with them that they shouldn´t have taken. Very soon an old friend of theirs is resurrected and the fun begins. In 'The Mummy Returns', lots of the comedy from part one has been removed in favor of more special effects. Because there are lots of those here. Too many, I would say. Sure, they are great to look at (except for one certain effect towards the end, shame on you ILM), and helps the movie to keep the pace up. But it feels like Stephen Sommers should have trusted more on his actors, and less on the effects. The film has its moments, the Scorpion King not being one, and the fun rarely stops. The actors do a good job with the material they have, and it´s nice to see the beautiful actress Patricia Velasquez in a bigger role this time around. This is one of the better sequels I´ve seen in a long time.

A Clockwork Orange," A film everybody should see
","In 'A Clockwork Orange' we get to see the life from the eyes of the sadistic young man, Alex DeLarge (Malcolm McDowell). Together with his buddies he goes out at night and has fun, which means raping women, fighting with other gangs, assaulting innocents, etc etc. One night he is betrayed by his own and caught by the police. He is sent to jail, but after a few years he is offered a way out, all he has to do is participate in a little experiment... This is supposed to make him a good man, but will it really work without any dangerous side-effects? This is one of Stanley Kubrick´s most famous movies, and also the most provocative. In the beginning I thought, 'Come on, are we supposed to forgive this Alex and feel for him later on, after all evil things he is doing now? I can never have feelings for such a b*****d.' But Kubrick and McDowell actually pull this off, with their great directing and acting respectively. The movie takes place in the near future, but it more feels like it takes place in the seventies or something. It´s not quite enough to throw in some daft furniture and clothing. The futuristic music succeeds better with setting the tone, this is probably one of the better soundtracks I´ve heard.The script contains some corny dialogue, and the movie is probably not as provocative as it was when it was released. But it still has a very strong plot, with an interesting message: can people change? It´s not as good as Kubrick´s best movies (The Shining, Full Metal Jacket, 2001), but it´s pretty close. A film everybody should see. * * * *",Null,3,9,23 October 2001
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," Well-made adaption of the book
","Young soon-to-be wizard Harry Potter lives a dreadful life with his mean step-parents, untill one day when a letter arrives. It says that Harry is a wizard and he should come to a school called Hogwarts to learn more. Eventually, Harry is on his way to the school, where lots of adventures await him.'Harry Potter' has huge expectations on its shoulders, and I´m happy to say it lives up to them. But it should be added that I´m not a huge fan of the book, I read it and thought it was good, but I couldn´t really understand all the attention it has been given. But I have to say that Chris Columbus has created an excellent adaption, that includes the very best parts of the story and also remains faithful to J.K Rowling´s book. It has the same nice details as the book and it actually takes its time to develop the characters. The effects are mostly top-notch and the set-pieces are awesome. The climax is definitely the Quidditch match, this was made to be seen on the big screen!If you think of how many child actors we have here, the acting is sensational! Daniel Radcliffe is perfect and just as I imagined Harry. However, he is easily outshined by ginger-haired Rupert Grint, who plays young comedian Ron Weasly, who provides the most laughs. But the real discovery of the kids is Emma Watson as bossy Hermione. You could tell after one minute of Ms Watson that she will be huge in the future! The older actors are perfectly cast as well. Richard Harris, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith are solid, while Robbie Coltrane and John Hurt provide warmth.The movie´s few problems is its length, I definitely don´t agree with those who thought it was to short. It loses tempo towards the end, and the finale is a disappointment. Another problem is that the book is not without its flaws from the very beginning. You could forgive it since it takes more than half of the movie to introduce the characters and the environments. Because after that comes a cheap story about a 'Philosopher´s Stone' that feels relatively uninteresting. But you have to remember that this is the first episode of a long series. Looking forward to 'The Chamber of Secrets' already.4/5",8,0,0,2 January 2002
Any Given Sunday," One of Oliver Stone´s best
","Al Pacino plays an aging football coach who has seen better days. His team Florida Sharks are in big trouble, the best player is injured and a new hot-shot is tearing the team apart. And the bitchy team owner (Cameron Diaz) won´t get off his back untill the team start winning again.
In 'Any Given Sunday', director Oliver Stone shows us his thoughts about the world of pro football, on and off the field. He has recruited lots of talented actors, Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, James Woods and newcomer Jamie Foxx to name a few. Everyone involved does a good job and actually convinces us that they are in the football business.
The film has Oliver Stone printed all over it, with razor-sharp editing and a pumping soundtrack, and it reminds of his controversial movie 'Natural Born Killers'. This one is just as good as 'NBK', because it remains both believable and exciting at the same time. Being a European, I still don´t understand the joy about one of the world´s strangest sports, but the movie did entertain.My only complains are the movie´s length (162 minutes) which feels a bit too long, and the part of the movie when we get to face Pacino´s personal problems never gets as interesting as the events out on the field.4/5",7,1,2,29 December 2001
