The Hangover," Funniest film of the 21st century so far!
","I've paid to see 'The Hangover' 13 times (my personal record for one title), so until a funnier flick comes along, it's my gold standard for what a modern comedy should be. A lot of folks would call this funny, but not the funniest. I can understand that perspective. And a lot of people who weren't laughing at all were attending weekend screenings I was at. I can only tell those who didn't bust a gut at this Vegas is hell story they should have stayed home and watched reruns of 'Murder, She Wrote' or whatever crap they find entertaining. To keep seeing a film multiple times is to sometimes get a dream crowd and other days get a group of codgers who are simply at the wrong movie for them! Those Tuesday nights when the theatre was packed were amazing and the collective riotous laughter was louder than any other film I've been to besides 'There's Something About Mary' and 'This is Spinal Tap'. I can only hope we get another collaboration from Phillips, Helms, Cooper, Galifianakis, Bartha and the rest of this band of lunatics. Best film of 2009!",10,3,6,23 November 2009
Chinatown," This is the writer's film, not the director's!
","It has always annoyed me when a screenwriter's contribution is overlooked so the director can jump to the front of the credit parade, as far as importance to the project is determined. In his book 'Hollywood Animal', Joe (Basic Instinct) Eszterhas describes how the man who lensed two of his scripts, Costa Gavras, was talking at a college and the so called film students, who've bought into this auteur theory, didn't really get it that somebody else conceived and wrote the piece in the first place.Robert Towne is a man who apparently is very fast with doctoring others' stories and very slow with the completion of his own scripts. If it really took him seven years to write 'Chinatown' (as Robert Evans claimed in 'The Kid Stays In The Picture'), then it was worth it for the whole world out there. This is an original work which should be judged differently than adapted projects. In 'Premiere' magazine a few years ago, there was a list of the best screenplays ever. Well, to be fair, one should separate the 'Chinatown's of the industry from films that turn plays, TV shows, video games and novels into big screen transformations.Towne's reputation as the guy most young writers look up to is secure, even if he never wrote anything else again. On the commentary for 'Wonderland', James Cox and Captain Mauzner are practically jumping up and down recalling a meeting they had with Towne, at which he lauded praise on their John Holmes based investigation/exploration.Yes, Towne can create indelible characters and scenarios which actors and even in this case, directors, should kiss his hand for. I see there is a disc out now with a commentary track featuring David Fincher and Towne. Can't wait to hear that!'Chinatown' was vintage before the recalling of the past was just another cinematic clich√© and excuse for young men to wear their grand pappy's old suits. The 1930s are beaming with some promise here and the unscrupulous moguls have a plan to get really rich (as if they weren't already) by screwing whoever they have to out of their fair share of nature's resources.Jack Nicholson and his almost father in law, John Huston, are both perfect in their roles as the detective and the crusty bastard whose evil lies at the heart of this whole display of an era when shame had much more power than it does in today's tell all society. Faye Dunaway has her finest moments in a terrific career in this epic. She shows (and doesn't at key moments) the full range of emotions this resilient lady is always going through and that a woman's world seventy plus years ago was radically different than today's.'Chinatown' is certainly one of the great works of art from film's first century. Let's hope some other rich in spirit and plotting screenwriter watches this, for the first or hundredth time, and pens something worth being in the same category of quality.",10,4,7,13 December 2009
Se7en," SE7EN could even be a great silent film
","I watched this disc with the isolated score track, so that's why I wrote a summary out of left field. I'm a David Fincher nut and if he directed the Yellow Pages, I'd be there waiting to see it. (In an amusing analogy, Samuel L. Jackson was on a talk show over a decade ago, I think it was 'Vibe', and he read out loud from those pages and it was great!)So when Fincher, who's one of the few to earn the right to be called visionary, makes a movie, it's an event. 'SE7EN' is full of vile images, depraved people and an outright hideous aura of urban hell. The desire to help, if you could call what homicide detectives work at help, is at the core of this sin in seven parts picture. Morgan Freeman is such a commanding actor, you'd believe him in just about any part. Here he is, tired, ready to exit the blood soaked carpet of police work, even if his soul will never truly let him walk away from it. He'd be in his den, looking at crime scene photos from some long ago unsolved mystery and put in triple overtime in the unpaid retired police department.Brad Pitt's character can stand to learn a lot from his senior partner, but he can't settle down or wait unless he absolutely has to. His impetuousness almost gets them in over their heads and John Doe (played by you know who) enjoys the sick game he unfurls like some epic serialized saga from the bowels of hell. Pitt and the mystery man are on a collision course and something has got to give.This film is so rich visually and it's bizarre to call a tour of the evil human soul yanked out for all to witness 'rich'. Try to forget any shot you've ever seen from a Fincher picture and it's pretty much impossible. The man's style is like the old masters painting on celluloid.'SE7EN' is best appreciated after a while without having watched it, at least that's how I approach the repeated views. Andrew Walker gave us a script which pretty much is the best fictional interpreting of a madman's mind. I doubt anyone will come up with anything more devilishly clever.",10,0,0,7 December 2009
Fight Club," Where's my Furni catalogue?
","It amuses me when some person goes on a talk show and tells people not to see a film! The reaction to 'Fight Club' and others by certain mouthy types (who might have even seen it!) was really a dumb approach to avoiding attention directed at what they perceive as dangerous. Michael Medved was a bit less silly in his various objections over the years than others (Kathie Lee Gifford for instance), as a critic having watched Oliver Stone's 'JFK', which he called 'an evil film' and 'Natural Born Killers' (he described it as a lot of things, among them, 'never boring', in his pan review).So here we are, ten years after this David Fincher directed adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel (Jim Uhls wrote the screenplay). Blu-ray is the new standard for watching discs at home and 'FC' has just come out in this format (with an adorably annoying 'Never Been Kissed' initial menu pop up showing everyone's favourite friend of Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore!). I'll buy it eventually. For now, the old two disc special edition will hold up just fine with it's four commentary tracks (including one with Palahniuk and Uhls). The world is much more screwed up than a decade ago and almost all of that is definitely not the fault of 'FC' or any other work which doesn't pretend joining hands and singing 'Kumbaya' will make our species love itself and end our crises.'FC' is like a street and book wise reaction to infomercials that promise some help for the unhappy and broken in society. Any mature adult has reached the conclusion that the bad things in life make up at least half of what even the best adjusted of us must cope with. 'Jack', the ultimate unreliable narrator, is burnt out. His life degenerates into travelling as a paid stooge for a big company, weighing whether paying people for what money can't make up in losses works for his bosses. He doesn't just hit rock bottom, he orders Furni (read, IKEA!) products from there! How much can a person have left of their soul when they are drawn to 12 step meetings for conditions nobody in their right mind wants to cope with?So when the tag team from new friend hell emerge, 'Marla' and 'Tyler', 'Jack' is drawn to both of their live for today spirits. He's such a function of the clock, going out into the world without a watch and an itinerary is his ultimate rebellion. The question is, how long can the narrator keep up with the dastardly duo who shock and invigorate him?There's a wonderful collection of essays on the film, some long and complex, others short and to the point. Not many movies can warrant a book about what started as a book. 'Fight Club' remains as a phoenix rising out of show biz's late 90s ashes. Will offend as many, if not more, than it delights.",10,2,5,17 December 2009
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Jason Segel gave us the best film of 2008!
","Who thought the young man who played Nick Andopolis on 'Freaks and Geeks' would write and star in what I consider the best film ever to come from that show's alumni? What Jason Segel has created is full of naked emotion and soul rattling, loony creativity, the likes of which come around so rarely, it's truly a wonder to behold. Every major character in this film has bad and good traits that come to light sooner or later and the hilarious combination of anger, fear, passion, artistry and hope for a better future explode in one memorable scene after another. I paid to see this 10 times and the last view was just as entertaining as the first. Hawaii has never looked so inviting. The famous from television Kristin Bell and Mila Kunis prove themselves resourceful big screen actresses in their deeply played roles as Jason's former and current love interests. Russell Brand wows in his first significant US part as a self absorbed pop star who remains likable after all the trouble he leaves in his wake. Firm comic support is provided by too many other actors to name here (they're all great!). And Jason sets the bar very high for himself with a gutsy performance and an amazing script that contains many original and hilarious songs you'll never be able to forget. There are no small dreams, only small puppets!",10,2,8,23 November 2009
Zodiac," David Fincher's best is challenging and not for everybody
","'Zodiac' is a perfect match of visionary director and hard to condense material. James Vanderbilt did an admirable job of taking a larger than one life story and somehow adapted all these people and events (chronicled in Robert Graysmith's two thorough books on the subject) into a script that works. He should have received an Oscar nomination, along with Fincher, supporting actor Mark Ruffalo (portraying Inspector Dave Toschi) and of course, 'Zodiac' itself for best picture. But the silly academy doesn't reward films like this often and I'll bet less than 20% of them even saw it! As author James Ellroy says on a commentary track, this film is respectful of the victims. The intensity of a murder investigation has rarely been recreated more impressively than here. To compare modern (21st century) technology with what these folks had to work with in the late 60's/70's is to realize 'Zodiac', whoever he was, had to be one of the dumb luckiest criminals of all time. His ideas were not original to put it politely and the fact he probably was a child molester really makes him a predator that treated society in general like a little innocent he abused for his own perverse reasons. Men who feel powerless and then get a big gun are the most dangerous fools of all because they're ticked off and want somebody, anybody to pay!",10,59,84,23 November 2009
Milk," Sean Penn is Milk!
","I use the word portray often when writing these comments, because 'playing' a part that might be drawn from real people is leaving room for some playfulness that 'portraying' an actual human on stage or screen shouldn't allow. A moral responsibility is undertaken with the acting challenge of transforming a real person's life story into a performance. And the performance Penn gives comes as close as possible to reincarnating the man who remains one of the most significant figures of 20th century America. Harvey Milk helped galvanize the spirits and activism of millions, not just gay but anybody concerned with honesty in government, police brutality, reforming the drug laws, cleaning up the streets and not penalizing the entire lives of those who didn't fit into the radical right wing's vision of the future.Director Gus Van Sant and the other actors deliver brilliantly, showing things as they were concerning the changing nature of San Francisco and the whole world meant having to confront the bigotry that was in full flight then and still is to an awful degree today. Emile Hirsch (portraying Cleve Jones) is one of the best young actors in the world and Josh Brolin gives another spot on exploration into the dark side of modern man.His Dan White was, shall we say, more active, with successive careers and otherwise, than the average man ever imagines being. The assassin of Milk and Mayor George Moscone (Victor Garber) was in the military, then became a firefighter and police officer before entering city politics. Whatever demons drove White to his ultimate fate remain known only to him (though at one point, Milk offers his own theory).'Milk' is best appreciated with a viewing of Rob Epstein's 'The Times Of Harvey Milk', an Oscar winning documentary that shows just how much Harvey meant to so many and how accurate Penn was with his Oscar winning portrayal.",9,0,2,2 December 2009
Alien," Space is infinite in your imagination
","I don't like the term 'science fiction' at all. It conjures up images of socially awkward young men who prefer action figures over human companionship. People from all walks of life can watch a film, even one rooted in some science fact and/or fiction and appreciate the drama, action, humour and whatever else is at the root of it all. 'Alien' devours mere genres and spits them out!'Alien' is as much artist H.R. Giger's film as writers Ronald Shusett's and Dan O'Bannon's (RIP) or director Ridley Scott's or lead Sigourney Weaver's. His designs have influenced modern art (and I mean the best of modern art, not the over-hyped crap!) to an immense degree. The 'alien' entities human actors confront right in front of them (or fake a reaction to, because all the digital hocus pocus comes much later in computer files) are never pretty. They almost always provoke a reaction of disgust in an audience and rightly so. Us humans can be quite small as far as our collective humanity goes. Do we really want to consider what extra terrestrials in this universe mean for our survival when we haven't exactly solved our petty disputes here on earth?This film holds up remarkably well due to a cast that are never less than believable and a script which doesn't drop the ball near the end, not following up the intense emotions with schmaltzy sentiment. The compulsively watchable Tom Skeritt, Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton are taking a backseat to Weaver's 'Ripley', who proves a lady action hero can be smart, tough and sexy without losing her femininity.I don't really have anything to say about the sequels. Sometimes a franchise is best left unexplored further when you think the original is unbeatable.",10,2,5,10 December 2009
Burn After Reading," Don't burn this, watch it again!
","I find that a second viewing of any Coen brothers' film helps me settle into that particular story's groove and overall, I enjoy it much more than the first time. The initial impression is we were thrown a curveball when expecting a fastball down the middle. And this certainly applies to 'Burn After Reading'.This comedy is very funny and those who aren't hip to the Coen trip will probably not enjoy it as much as their core audience. Espionage gets turned back assward into the harsh winds of adult games like infidelity and social posturing. A never funnier Brad Pitt is the dimbulb that lights up this crazy ensemble and his colleagues Frances McDormand and Richard Jenkins get to be most effective playing ordinary folks who are in way over their heads.George Clooney is too often expected to be Mr. Smooth in many of his roles. Here, he'll entice the ladies and also disgust them with his 'how the hell did this guy get that job?' role. The man whose top priority is getting a run in before hitting the sheets at night gets much more than he bargained for.John Malkovich is brilliant, as always. I hope he works with the Coens again soon. His over the hill bitter lemon of a male finds himself hating everything in the world and not much good can come from the dark cloud his brain is immersed by. The Coens may be guilty of many things, but repeating themselves isn't one of them.",9,2,8,13 December 2009
No Country for Old Men," The same respective side of two very different coins
","You know a trailer was great and did it's job when you watch it for the first time and think, 'I want to see this right now!' Such was the case after I witnessed this film's visual blurb and couldn't stand the wait until it came out. And the film itself did not disappoint! (Even though a second view helped me get a better handle on the whole arc of it's events.) It's creepy from moment one. The whole atmosphere is like the ends of the earth itself, whether Josh Brolin is out hunting, at home or in some rented room for a while. You probably have an advantage if you haven't read the book, I guess, not having read the book yet myself. The knowledge of what is going to happen from scene to scene would have only ruined the ability to take all this in and not process the action (and actions of the folks involved) the wrong way. Meaning, some events that are pure clich√© in most films don't happen here, at least not nearly the way one might think they will. Expecting formula fare from 'No Country For Old Men' is like trying to buy vending machine candy from a gasoline pump. The Oscar winning Javier Bardem redefines the word intimidating for the early 21st century, as his murderous robot of a criminal shows all the emotion of dry ice. The aftermath of people taking their eyes off what should not be ignored at all leads to lethal consequences for so many. Brolin and Bardem are pretty much polar opposites in this tale, but share a resilience that keeps their wounded men going when most males would run screaming into a police station to end this descent into sheer torture.",9,1,2,7 December 2009
Paranormal Activity," My lowest rated film to comment on so far
","It's appropriate that the average rating for this is 7 (from the 9th of December 2009 stats), as I debated what to designate this box office triumph before checking the stats myself and then discovered my vote was right on the money. Millions of people saw this and thousands have voted. There are already over 666 comments (a nice, round, evil number!) so now I'll toss my stone in the agitated pond too.'Paranormal Activity' has some creepy qualities going for it, but unfortunately, when this flick delivers, it's much too little, way too late. The two main characters are not the kind you'd want to spend time with. They complain, act like overgrown children and generally carry on like a ghost or thirteen should come along and give them the scare of their lives.I kept waiting for a certain person that is repeatedly mentioned to show up and guess what? He ain't a coming! (I didn't mention that person's line of work, not knowing if that would constitute a 'spoiler' or not.) The alleged frights in this are more than a little hokey and I felt many opportunities to really get under the audiences' skin were wasted.I'm glad I saw this and am also quite disappointed in it. Part of me wanted to stand up at the end and yell out, 'I want my money back!', if only to get a few laughs from others at the packed screening who agreed with my sentiments. Can we get any lower budgeted film that doesn't have shaky cameras all the time? And if they make a sequel, let's get a real aficionado of the paranormal like Dan Aykroyd to put on a silly costume and accent and come investigate! That's a bloody movie idea of real interest to me. As it stands, 'Paranormal Activity' is a story whose plot is basically a 'spoiler' to itself! Great ending, poor everything else up till then.",7,0,1,9 December 2009
The Dark Knight," The most frequently posted film ever? (#3223)
","As I just checked the number of comments that have been written and accepted for IMDb, I see there are 3222 for 'The Dark Knight'. Typing this at 12:44 am (EST), I wonder who will read this umpteenth musing on what is the monster hit movie of our era?What makes this flick so awesome? I went to it the first time at an IMAX screening and was pleasantly shocked at how effective the full screen shots were (I counted at least 35 separate ones in the film overall). Seeing the collective jaws drop over this made me wish the whole thing had been shot in this format, but that would have made it criminally expensive. Is charging thirty dollars a ticket an acceptable way of getting another 'Batman' sequel IMAXed?I saw it a second time at the same theatre a few months later when it was brought back for a limited return engagement. This time there weren't any other people in the front section I prefer to sit in and the absence of a huge crowd helped me focus on the entire film. I liked it much more the second time, when it's relentless hype machine was finally taking a break.The role of this superhero has been played by so many different men over the years, I have come to the conclusion I don't want to see anyone else in the part other than Christian Bale. He fits this part like the tight suit he runs around Gotham in fits him. It gets rather silly when the casting of such a world wide franchise is being shuffled like a deck of cards. Stick with one dependable person and be done with the games already! (Some folks think Michael Keaton almost had the kibosh put on his career when he didn't want to play this a third time. I don't know if that's true, but hope it isn't. He's a great talent and shouldn't be limited to something he doesn't have his heart in anymore.)The role of the Joker is another matter entirely. I'm beyond angry Heath Ledger died such a stupid and preventable death. A little girl lost her father, a family lost their son/brother and we as his fans don't get to share in his unique gift anymore.I got sick of all the pre-release publicity and then disgusted by the tabloid fest his demise became. Let the family and friends grieve in peace. Only now, after all the smoke clears, can I truly view his amazing performance and take it in as the brilliant acting it was. Not just the vehicle for awards driven advertising, but a sincere relationship between a star, their art and his audience.If there's another 'Batman' down the line, it'll have a hard time topping this. Too bad the price one pays for success is having to compete with their own legacy.",10,0,2,7 December 2009
Grindhouse," 2 and several fractions for the price of 1
","I feel the need to think and write about 'Grindhouse' as one complete entity, because splitting up the distinct parts is like separating a head from the torso, arms and legs that let it rise up and chase whatever it feels threatened by. This wacko love letter to the less than elegant cinema experience is disgusting, exciting, uproarious and about a thousand other words I could type. I saw it twice in the spring of 2007 and would have went a few more times if it hadn't disappeared as quickly as it did. The tickets were worth every penny.The packed houses were rocking for three hours each time and I'm still annoyed more people didn't support the full 'Grindhouse' package, as they could have done much worse in choosing a flick to go see that year. The only remedy I can propose is keep the budgets down and make two more features (this time from different directors), create some new trailers (including one each from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino) and market the heck out of this package deal, hoping there is a larger audience who are hipper to this trip the second time around. The flaw wasn't in the concept, it was with the youth crowd who should have been out there supporting a more bang for your buck venture.Rodriguez drops a great bomb of a tale (confirming my theory that a zombie movie always kicks the ass of a vampire movie!). His wild and wonderful 'Planet Terror' is the great blending of several b-movie staples into one funny and vital alloy. Quentin gets his finest hour as an actor, revelling in the scum passing for human he plays for all it's worth. Rose McGowan, Freddy Rodriguez and Josh Brolin each have meaty material to devour and the supporting cast (especially the crazy babysitter twins) all have the time of their lives. Complaining about Tarantino's dialogue or anything else that was a pet peeve of the 'Death Proof' critics is missing the point. These characters hang out and shoot the breeze until it's time to shoot the enemy! Here, Kurt Russell gets a character just as rich (if not richer) than Snake Plissken and he makes the most of it. His one brick shy of a load stuntman is the kind of fringe player most people in film have met at some point and he gives the best performance of his career. And Zoe Bell gets my award for most insane physical performance by an actual stunt woman (how did they ever get insurance for her on this f$$king project?...didn't anyone read the script?!).My only complaint is Mary Winstead didn't get to belt out a few more numbers (hint, hint, Quentin...bring back Mary as Lee Montgomery in another project!). Maybe her character should have been a pop star who isn't a total studio gimmick, as her voice is far superior to most of the young ladies making a living as so called singers. Baby, it's her that deserved more screen time!",9,16,19,30 November 2009
Any Given Sunday," The grand opera of sports brutality is just a business now!
","With it's large and noisy figures, one could say football has a little something in common with opera! And the high ticket prices mean people really want to see what they went there for in the first place. Yes, whatever artistry is on display is anchored in the business of spectacle.The NFL has been around for decades and the players are now bigger, faster and sometimes stronger. All this natural and chemical enhancement means athletes train year round, not just from camp to playoffs. And those taking legal or illegal substances are using those twelve months a calendar too.'Any Given Sunday' is fast, frenetic and almost impossible to follow at times because that's what the action is like for quarterbacks, receivers, linebackers and all the others on the gridiron. Things happen so rapidly, it's a wonder anybody can hold onto the pigskin for more than a second. Look at what happened to NFL tough guys like Jim Otto and Mike Webster on and off the field and you'll see how devastating the consequences of competing at this level truly are.Jim Brown, who appears in this film, wrote quite frankly about his experiences playing nine bone crushing seasons as a pro. And the anecdotes he tells about his teams and others are reflected in this tribute to the old guard's last stand against the digital era's absolute takeover of this most manly game. Players do get violently ill before games (and sometimes during, though usually not on the field) and guys on the same team don't have to be friends at all to work well together. When every stat is judged for the possible bonus in one's contract, the desire to be a showboat is more obvious than ever.Al Pacino is both wonderfully world weary and youthfully (for a man his age) still excited about coaching the team he has been with since before Cameron Diaz took over from her late father, the founding owner. You know egos will clash as this proud man, whose whole life is football, has to take orders from a young lady who isn't as old as some of his shirts.Jamie Foxx is terrific as the back up's back up, who's thrust into the spotlight when starter Dennis Quaid is injured and his successor also gets knocked out of commission. Foxx shows all the fear and anger integral to quarterbacking, as he goes from 'who's he?' to 'the team's hope for the future!'. The pressure and sycophancy young stars deal with is now his 24 hour a day schedule.Oliver Stone isn't the first name you'd think of when wondering who'd direct a big screen flick about sports, but he took a break from the war-conspiracy complex he usually dwells in and did something interesting and fun here, as fun as broken bones contact sports can be.",8,0,1,14 December 2009
Blade Runner," Too bad Philip K. Dick didn't get to watch this completed
","I don't watch this film as often as a lot of my all time favourites, because that's like trying to eat a side of beef everyday! There's so much here, it's a challenge to your eyes, ears and everything else. Some films are like an entr√©e, some a main course, others a dessert. Then there's this, a meal for the cinematic mind that fills me up something really fierce. I don't feel the need to take in anything else for a while, because 'Blade Runner' stuffs me to my limit.You probably know the story and have your own opinions about who is what and all that jive. Let's talk about how well this has held up for so many years. It practically looks like it was made last week! Only '2001' before it and 'The Matrix' since have had the impact 'Blade Runner' has (don't get me started on 'Star Wars', I have no desire to see that again). And I'm still waiting for the next visionary to come along, take the baton and run with it. Dick wasn't too thrilled with many approaches to books adapted for the screen, his in particular. The overall attitude towards science facts and fiction is almost 100% different than in those days when the first attempts to make 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?' reared their heads. He outright hated what was on the initial agenda and then after seeing early footage of 'Blade Runner', changed his tune radically (in interviews one can hear, but not see, on a supplemental disc of the special edition of this classic).Harrison Ford had many intriguing parts between instalments of his mega global hit franchises. Rick is the greatest of all his dramatic ciphers, someone existing to connect the dots that can barely be seen at all. Watch him struggle to stay on two legs, physically and psycho-emotionally, as you can never really imagine Indiana Jones, Han Solo or the creepy man he played in 'The Conversation' trying to similarly keep their heads above water. He's a man truly alone even in a crowd, that probably has a dozen thoughts competing for room in his overloaded brain all the time.Ridley Scott has made a feast for graphic designers, with every shot holding some image that makes you go, 'wow!' I was shocked when buying a video game system a while back that there wasn't a 'Blade Runner' game display advertising all the big companies on board with cheapening the memories of this landmark for the sake of money. When you just expect any vital film now to have it's ancillary profits boosted through those markets, it's rather refreshing to not see children from ten to fifty playing 'Rick', like his significance was just destined to be a gamer's amusement.",10,0,2,3 December 2009
Casino," How the West was lost
","It really annoys me that this great film can never get it's own identity in the popular mind. Too many simplistic comparisons to 'Goodfellas', probably made by boneheads who think imitating Joe Pesci's, 'How am I funny?' line is amusing, when the only person who should ever say that again is Mr. Pesci himself. 'Casino' is a very different film in it's gut than it's country cousin from the East coast. And it's also based on another awesome book by Nicholas Pileggi.Martin Scorsese lights another bunch of movie dynamite with this shotgun blast to the face of a flick. My minor issue is with who's playing Sam 'Ace' Rothstein (based on Frank 'Lefty' Rosenthal). Don't get me wrong, I think Robert De Niro is fabulous in the part. But if I were casting this, I would have selected Gary Sinise for the role. Anyway, De Niro is at the top of his game again, this odds making genius a drastic departure from his Jimmy in 'Goodfellas', who was a homicidal thief and nowhere near as brilliant as this figure who mastered the art of staying out of trouble, until his wife and best friend ruin it all.Nicky, the thug Pesci plays here (based on Tony 'the Ant' Spilotro), is different from Tommy, which earned him an Oscar (and Mr. P gave a short and sweet, 'It's my privilege, thank you!' speech, letting us see not all prize winning performers have to spend an eternity on stage, thanking the whole world!). Tommy was ashamed his brother testified against certain people you don't rat on if you want to live in Brooklyn much longer. That inspired the spark plug of 'Goodfellas' to be the craziest, most vicious killer of the whole bunch. His role in 'Casino' is slightly more subtle and for much different reasons. Tommy never would sleep with his friend's wife, like the Vegas bound troublemaker from Chicago that he plays here does.A very insidious kind of betrayal takes place with Ace's future wife, Ginger, Sharon Stone's relentless hustler. This woman lets us see the hollow shell her character really is. After taking all she can from anybody she can, this creature runs off to her scumbag pimp Lester, played by the great James Woods, giving him her money and love, not realizing or being lucid enough to care he's the ultimate parasite. Sam can brush off Lester easily. His protector from the windy city who comes to the desert and screws up what should have been their paradise is another matter.Pesci shows this wise guy Nicky is his own worst enemy and everything he touches turns to hell. Tommy would have kept a modicum of common sense and loyalty to his buddy, not wanting all that money, power and success to blow away like so much dust in the Nevada wind.",9,1,2,6 December 2009
Goodfellas," The first mob film that got it dead right
","Back in the early 90's, criminals simply weren't presented as they really were. This started the trend in the proper direction, showing a schism in organized crime that cracked it's foundation and highlighted the downward swing they've been on for decades now.Brooklyn born and raised Henry Hill is half Irish and therefore can't be a made man. His neighbourhood cronies treat him like family, but still he can never get to the big leagues of the mob. Paulie is their particular district's big boss, who detests drugs and the threat they represent to his way of conducting business (and staying out of prison). Jimmy is homicidal and also the greatest and most shameless thief around, who's been in and out of jail since childhood and also can't be made and fully accepted due to his Irish blood. And to round out this cast of characters is Tommy, a smoking gun that bristles with hot headed rage at the slightest imagined insult. Together, this can only add up to trouble!Paulie is one of the last who believes in the old code and the coming cocaine revolution is like a tidal wave that will reduce his little world to rats scurrying off the sinking ship that organized crime is degenerating into. Under his watch, the younger men that are like sons to him lie, break rank with their criminal common sense and generally act like they prefer stupidity over any kind of self preservation. Little remarks at a card game or bar or on the street get people killed faster than lightning. Huge scores are not about equal shares when one man wants everything, save for a tribute kicked up to the big boss, for himself.The mob could have continued all powerful if certain trends hadn't taken over. But what went down meant becoming an informer wasn't unthinkable anymore, it was now plan B. The soldiers on the streets felt their superiors were out of touch with major opportunities and the old moustache Petes lost the battles they could never win. Drugs were and are at every level of society and Henry Hill was one of countless souls that didn't save for a rainy day because they wanted to get high and ignored the depth of the big picture.Read the amazing book 'Wiseguy' Nicholas Pileggi wrote with Henry's no holds barred account of his sordid life filling out the details one really needs to fully appreciate this film. There are millions of criminals in the world, but most of them never go on the record so unnervingly.",10,0,0,28 November 2009
