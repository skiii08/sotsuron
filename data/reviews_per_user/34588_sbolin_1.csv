The Blair Witch Project," You get what you pay for.
","I can imagine that when this movie first came out and people believed that it was the actual discovery of footage from a lost student film crew that it would have been scary.  What amazes me is that once it was known that the 'students' were really actors and that they were very much alive, the popularity of this movie continued.  There is virtually no plot and the improvised dialogue can be summed up as 'don't f**k with my mind,' 'what the f**k is going on'.  The characters were so boring with ti that it was a relief to have them 'taken by the witch.'The entire movie was predictable including the trite ending.  It was made for $30,000 and is proof that you get what you pay for.",1,1,3,2 November 1999
