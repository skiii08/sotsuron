Casablanca," Exceeds Any and All Expectations
","We might all grow up in different areas on the world, but chances are, you've heard of Casablanca. And when you hear it, people immediately gush over how good it is. At first I was skeptical, surely there had to be something in the film that people overlooked. I was wrong. This film is an absolute masterpiece, and is probably the finest film every created. It would be sacrilege to not include this on any 'All Time Top 10' lists, because it is simply that good. A film doesn't just start out as being a stunning work of art, but with all of the directorial talent, and especially the work of Humphrey Bogart in the lead role, this is it. Suffice it to say that when this film was over, I certainly went to 'play it again.' This is simply one of the best films ever created. Ever.",10,1,2,8 May 2014
Citizen Kane," Wonderful American Cinema
","This is one of those historic movies that people are either raving about, or trying to bash it. This argument weighed on my mind when I first watched this film, but I found quickly that it has been praised for great reasons. Orson Welles, starring, directing, and producing, did a great job in all three roles he had. Much of this film is told through flashbacks, and goes to show the rise to prominence of Charles Foster Kane, but keys in on the mystery of Rosebud. What does it mean? The mystery will not be revealed here, you have to find out for yourself. This film was named an iconic piece of American cinema for a reason. To fully understand and appreciate it, you have to see the film. Only then can you judge and decide.",9,1,2,8 May 2014
Apocalypse Now," The Real Horror
","With a big name director in Francis Ford Coppola, and such a star studded cast, was there ever any doubt that this film wouldn't blow people away? Drawing influence from the book 'Heart of Darkness' by Joseph Conrad, this Vietnam War epic was incredible to watch. To me, it is one of those films that I can (and would) watch over and over again, without ever growing tired of it. Martin Sheen and Marlon Brando deliver all star performances, and especially Brando as the mad Colonel Kurtz, make for a chilling ending, with the dying colonel reflecting on the horrors of war, and what they had done to him. The real horror, however, was when the film ended, because I wanted to see more. And to end on a special note, I love the smell of napalm in the morning.",10,0,1,8 May 2014
Annie Hall," Woody Allen's Masterpiece
","I am most certainly biased about this movie, as it is in my top 5 favorite movies of all time. Woody Allen is a comedic genius, and this film is living, breathing proof that he is. This film explores so much, between identity, gender differences, but in my opinion, the most important thing discussed is love. The best way to describe this film is to go see it, because it is funny on so may levels. Diane Keaton almost made me fall in love with her because of this film, which is due solely to how she acts in this film. I took a piece of life advice from this film as well, pertaining to love. 'Love is essential, especially if it is neurotic.' So go watch this film, and try to take something away from it, because not only is it funny, it is smart.",10,0,0,8 May 2014
The Graduate," Absolutely Fantastic Piece of Film
","When I saw the end of the movie, I immediately thought of Wayne's World 2, and I knew where they bit that end off from. And now, with hindsight being the clearest, they picked an excellent film to rip off. Dustin Hoffman, playing the recent college graduate, which I can feel for, does an excellent job of portraying the cluelessness that we as young people have when the world that we know of ends. Add a sociopathic cougar into the mix, and it seems easy to believe that the young man had more than enough on his plate. To me, this film is special, because it was one of the first to really break free from the Hays Code, which had been lifted earlier that year. Without the restrictions, this film tells a great story, and pulls you in with a fantastic soundtrack. A definite must see.",9,0,0,8 May 2014
Singin' in the Rain," The Best Musical Film Created
","A film like Singin' in the Rain has such an iconic status for many reasons. The camera work is stunning, the directing is excellent, but what takes the cake are the actors and their choreography for the intricate musical numbers. I was blown away at how they moved so quickly and so elegantly. The film is also full of memorable moments, and the song where the title comes from was something special. It is because of this film that I became a fan of musicals, it is just that good. It truly is an iconic piece of American cinema, and you are doing yourself an injustice by not watching it at least once. Even if you are the manliest man in the land, there is a chance that you might enjoy this film, because it truly is that spectacular.",9,0,1,8 May 2014
Pulp Fiction," This Film is Royal... With Cheese
","Where do I start with this film? Quentin Tarantino made me a fan for life with this film, and the way the story is told hearkens back to 'The Killing' by Stanley Kubrick, with all of the broken up episodes, all leading to a Mexican stand-off in a diner. This film has created so many memorable moments in my mind, and some of which have been ingrained in pop culture as well. This film can be seen as the revitalization of one John Travolta, which he won Best Actor with his role of Vincent Vega. Samuel l. Jackson, however, is absolutely gold in this film, from quoting biblical verse to asking for his wallet, he delivers in the film non-stop. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and for good reason. You don't want to see this film, you NEED to.",10,0,2,8 May 2014
Psycho," Hitchcock At His Best
","Alfred Hitchcock delivered a masterpiece with Psycho. The mystique surrounding the film has become almost legendary, if only for the ultimate plot twist at the end of the film. Anthony Perkins, as the one and only Norman Bates, gives an incredible performance of an unfortunately troubled young man, and makes you feel truly sorry for he has endured in his life. Of course, the shower scene has to be addressed, but the music and the events are two special entities. The music, however, is what I feel gives an extra sense of suspense to the already startling moment. This film proves that Alfred Hitchcock was truly an innovator in directing films, and has left behind a legacy that will maybe never be approached again.",10,2,3,8 May 2014
The Wizard of Oz," A Childhood Favorite That Stands the Test of Time
","You would be hard pressed to find someone who hasn't seen the Wizard of Oz. It is just one of those movies that seemingly everyone has seen. In my family, it has been an old standby for all sorts of gatherings. After I re-watched it from a technical viewpoint, I was blown away by the sheer amount of work that went into creating this film. From the musical numbers to the pulling of heartstrings towards the climax, this film will bring you on a journey through an incredible land full of magic and wonder. This film has stood the test of time because of how it draws people in with such an innocent girl, and the wild adventure she embarks on, all to return to the ones she loves. What stand out to me however, is the key phrase of 'There's no place like home.' This little piece has left such an impact on so many people, it would be wrong to not include it. So if you are one of the few who has not seen the film, just go out and do it. You're missing out on Americana.",9,5,6,8 May 2014
