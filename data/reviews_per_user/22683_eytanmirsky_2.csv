Miracle," No Miracle needed
","What's great about this film is that it shows that the victory in 1980 was not a 'miracle,' but the result of an excuciating training regimen, in other words: good old-fashioned hard work.  That's what the U.S.A. is supposed to be about.",8,0,0,9 February 2004
Spider-Man 2," Enjoyable but kind of silly
","Yes, I know it's a comic book, but some of the plot details don't make much sense. If Dr. Octavius could invent artificial limbs that connected to his nervous system that would be a major scientific accomplishment in its own right and would make him and Oscorp billions by helping the paralyzed. Here's it's presented as an afterthought. And why he has to wear the artificial limbs to perform the experiment instead of using some kind of robot defies explanation. And then that everyone would stand around in a room where a highly dangerous experiment was taking place! But okay, it's only a movie, only a comic book.",Null,1,2,6 July 2004
