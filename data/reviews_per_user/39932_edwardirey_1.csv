Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Overall it was wonderful
","May contain spoiler, but only in general terms, nothing specific. I loved mainly the first part of the film, but the scene in the lady's etiquette dinner just about made me pee in my pants. I like the sensitivity towards minorities in the film. If you haven't seen it, go out there and get it. There are for me some sensitive issues with the film towards the end, some graphic scenes that are not normally shown in the TV show version of Sascha's show. Those I wish had not been in there, and I felt like I had to not tell my wife about the refrigerator incident, since she wasn't looking at the screen at the time. Primarily, I did that because we both had such a high opinion of the show and the film, and I didn't want such a graphic image to be retained in her mind. That was the only downer, but overall, like I said I loved it, and I can't wait for the second installment.",8,5,8,7 March 2007
