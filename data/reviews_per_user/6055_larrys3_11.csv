Skyfall," Powerhouse of a Movie
","Since the site has 1164 reviews as of this writing I'll just throw in my own two cents.Two of the world's greatest actors, namely Judi Dench and Javier Bardem, lead the way here. Daniel Craig, I thought, turned in another strong performance as the droll fearless 007.There's also wonderful support from Ralph Fiennes, as the new Intelligence Chairman, Ben Whishaw as Q, Albert Finney as the caretaker Kincade, and Naomie Harris as Eve Moneypenny.I found the film to be filled with humor and the special effects terrific. The movie is also very capably directed by the accomplished British director Sam Mendes.Perhaps, my only criticism would be the grand finale which I felt was somewhat drawn out and could have shortened the 2 hour 23 minute duration.I was surprised at the very negative reviews on the first page of IMDb. I found, overall, this new Bond film to be a powerhouse and I thoroughly enjoyed it.",9,55,76,14 February 2013
The Maze Runner," Intriguing Fantasy Tale
","I can see I am in the minority here, but, to be honest, I found the film to be quite intriguing and exciting. I went into the movie 'cold', not having read the novel by James Dashner or knowing very much about the plot. For me, this was the type of film that I knew if I just went with the flow and didn't try and look for all the holes in the story and script that I'd be better off.The way the film was presented by first time director Wes Ball was top notch, as I felt I was right there in the maze with the main characters. The obvious set-up for a sequel at the end of the movie didn't bother me too much as it seems like every movie of this type 'has to' have at least one.In summary, I found this movie to be very absorbing and kept my interest throughout.",7,25,33,28 December 2014
Last Flag Flying," One of Linklater's Best Films
","I thought this was one of director Richard Linklater's best films, as he also co-wrote the screenplay with Darryl Poniscan, from whose book the movie is based.
The three leads here Bryan Cranston, Steve Carell, and Laurence Fishburne give terrific performances, with Yul Vasquez and J. Quinton Johnson adding well to the mix in supporting roles.This film can be dark, crass, and very unsettling one moment but also be poignant and laced with humor that works more often than not. Also, the movie can be brutally anti-military at times, yet strongly patriotic as well. Somehow, the filmmakers managed to blend all of this together effectively.All in all, I found this to be an exceptional film that stayed with me long after it was over.",8,11,17,2 February 2018
Us," Loved 'Get Out' But 'Us' is Just Dumb
","Well, with over 2100 user reviews as of this date, I might as well add my 2 cents. I absolutely loved Peele's 'Get Out', but I thought 'Us' was one of the dumbest movies I've seen in a long time. With all the hype and glowing pro critic reviews this was a huge disappointment, to say the least.",2,8,12,23 June 2019
Spotlight," Stunningly Good
","Brilliantly acted, directed, and written, I just found this riveting and important film to be truly exceptional. Much of it is done in a low-key style, as layer after layer of the abuse by Catholic priests and subsequent cover-up by the Boston Archdiocese as well as other powerful interests, is uncovered by the Spotlight investigative team of the Boston Globe, in the early 2000's.I haven't yet seen all the movies nominated for the Best Picture Academy Award in 2016, but I can certainly see how this one won it, as well as winning Best Original Screenplay by Tom McCarthy (who also directed) and Josh Singer.Overall, just an outstanding motion picture that I would recommend highly.",10,14,24,29 March 2016
Interstellar," Has Its' Flaws But Still Found it Pretty Awesome
","At over 2100 reviews at the time of this writing, I guess there's nothing left to be said other than my opinion.I'd probably need a PhD in Physics from MIT to understand half of the technological terms in the movie, but I still found it to be rather awesome. After reading some of the reviews here, I think a lot of people are taking this sci-fi fantasy tale way too seriously and literally.Christopher Nolan's latest, which he co-wrote as well with his brother Jonathan, at 2 hrs and 48 min in length, can be ridiculously absurd one moment then quickly turn into riveting action the next.Matthew McConaughy and Anne Hathaway lead a long list of screen notables here, too numerous to mention. I did want to mention that I thought Mackenzie Foy, as Murph, the 10-year-old daughter of McConaughy was terrific in her role.I thought the musical score here was excellent, the wit and humor of the robot TARS (Bill Irwin) was on target. the special effects could be rather hokey at times but then other times were amazing, and the movie did contain a number of twists and turns which I liked.All in all, despite its' drawbacks I found this sci-fi fantasy to be a rather awesome and epic ride.",9,26,46,3 April 2015
Trouble with the Curve," Far Too Contrived and Formulaic
","With the talents of Clint Eastwood, Amy Adams, Justin Timberlake, and John Goodman you would think you'd be in for a really good movie. Unfortunately, I didn't feel that was the case. It seemed the makers of the film went out of their way to make the film as contrived and formulaic as possible. With the various soap operaish plot elements and stilted dialog I was rolling my eyes in disbelief, especially in the final twenty minutes or so of the film.I'm a big fan of Clint Eastwood's movie work, but I thought that the concept of him being Amy Adams' father was really far fetched. Grandfather maybe. Adams, as usual, lights up the screen whenever she appears, with her vivaciousness and charisma. John Goodman does his usual solid job as the Braves Director of Scouting, and Eastwood's boss. He tries to help Eastwood and shield him from the young 'vultures' who want to put Eastwood 'out to pasture' once and for all. Matthew Lillard is believable as the top young 'vulture' butt-kisser who has no respect for Eastwood and wants to enhance his own career.So with all this talent and what could have been a really decent story, why did the film makers have to take the predictable path at just about every turn? Oh well, just one man's opinion.",5,24,34,26 December 2012
Bridge of Spies," Hanks & Rylance Are Superb
","Tom Hanks and Mark Rylance lead the way here and give superlative performances in this cerebral and powerful Cold War drama. Another masterful movie from director Steven Spielberg, with a most solid screenplay from Matt Charman and the Coen Brothers, Ethan and Joel.The films all centers around the initial defense of accused Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Rylance) by attorney James B.Donovan (Hanks), which made Donovan a most unpopular man in America, especially when he appealed Abel's conviction all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, which upheld the conviction by a 5-4 vote.Meanwhile, in 1960, a U.S. U-2 pilot, Francis Gary Powers was captured by the Soviets, after his spy plane was shot down over Soviet territory. Subsequently, the American State Dept. would ask Donovan to possibly negotiate an exchange of Abel and Powers, since Donovan had been contacted by the Soviets through the East Germans that this might be possible.Based on true events, there's plenty of intrigue here as Donovan, through intense and difficult negotiations, tries to acquire the release of the two prisoners, along with a third prisoner the American student Frederic Pryor (Will Rogers), being held on 'spy' charges by the East Germans. It will all culminate in some amazing and tense scenes on the German Glienicke Bridge.All in all, I found this to be a first class movie, that despite it's length of 2 hrs. and 21 min., had me absorbed throughout.",8,8,11,5 February 2016
Hotel Mumbai," Brutally Disturbing
","This is a dramatization of the horrific terrorist attack on the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, in Mumbai in 2008, (one of 12 sites attacked on that day). In my opinion, there is way too much emphasis on the constant brutal cold blooded killings of innocent men and women throughout the movie, only occasionally relieved by the heroism of those living the nightmare inside the hotel.For those viewers that like constant close range mass indiscriminate slaughter and bloodshed then maybe this is your movie. But there's enough depressing events going on in the world on a daily basis, so I personally don't need 2 hours more of this.Overall, look for strong performances by Dev Patel, Jason Isaacs, and Anupam Kher but this film was far too disturbing for me.",3,133,284,30 June 2019
The Shape of Water," Shocking Experience
","This film is more of an experience than anything else. I went through all kinds of emotions watching it, and it will have avid supporters and loud detractors I'm sure.Michael Shannon, plays an evil 'baddie' as well as anyone these days, and this movie gives him a chance to really let loose. Sally Hawkins once again is amazing.in her role here.All in all, this film, in my opinion, with all its bizarre and shocking elements will be one I certainly will never forget.",8,30,56,31 March 2018
Draft Day," Taut & Engrossing Sports Tale
","There are some highly implausible and nonsensical plot elements here, yet despite that I found this movie to be a taut and engrossing sports tale and it kept my interest throughout.Kevin Costner gives another solid performance here as Sonny Weaver, Jr., the beleaguered General Manager of the Cleveland Browns, in the NFL. He has to contend with a meddling owner (Frank Langella), a combative head coach (Denis Leary) and a very angry fan base who are tired of losing. Additionally, his father has just passed away, as he was the former coach of the Browns and fired by Sonny Jr (we find out late in the movie the reason why). Finally, he's in a relationship with the team's capologist (Jennifer Garner), and has just found out she's pregnant with their baby.With the entire film set on NFL Draft Day, Sonny receives a call from the General Manager of the Seattle Seahawks who hold the #1 pick in the draft, who's expected to be the hot-shot quarterback Bo Callahan (Josh Pence). However, the Seahawks are willing to trade their #1 pick for a very dear price in return.Under threat of being fired unless he makes a big splash in the draft, Sonny reluctantly agrees to the deal. Thus begins a long series of 'wheelings and dealings' by NFL execs, as the start of the draft looms, which I thought was realistically portrayed, although I'm not sure how much non-football fans who don't know the lingo may understand.It all will culminate in what I thought was quite the dramatic ending. As mentioned, if one can get past the implausible script elements, it can be a good watch.The acclaimed filmmaker Ivan Reitman handles the direction here, with a screenplay from Rajiv Joseph and Scott Rothman.",7,5,6,17 September 2014
