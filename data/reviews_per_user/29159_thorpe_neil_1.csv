It," Stand by me and the Goonies meets horror
",I enjoyed the 1990 miniseries of 'it' with Tim Curry being awesome as Pennywise. However it seems extremely dated when watched nowadays. When I heard 'it' was being remade I knew how good it could potentially be. The new film does not disappoint. The bond between the friends reminds me of stand by me and the Goonies which are both fantastic. You care about the group in the film which almost never happens in a standard horror movie. The new Pennywise is really creepy as well and I look forward to Chapter 2. If you liked the original 'it' and liked stand by me you will enjoy this film.,8,3,7,15 September 2017
