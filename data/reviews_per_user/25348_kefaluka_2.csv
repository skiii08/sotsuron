Iron Man 3," Sad
","This is my first review and I've been nearly member for 4 years or more.Sorry for my English but I felt the urge to outburst my misery about this production. It is a disaster. I watched it yesterday. First of all it is not a super hero movie, it is mostly a minuscule psychological 'Analyze This' with a twist of ten year old shrink.I gave 4 points because I respect the production efforts, that's all. 60 percent of the movie was all about Mr. Stark trying to overcome his panic attacks and i feel totally fooled because of this. Have you watched trailers? The topic was Mandarin all over it. And then a cheap twist about Mandarin being an actor? Come on!!!Mandarin is one of the most important villains of Marvel Universe, at least an arch-enemy for Ironman. Can you fake Lex Luthor? Can you fake Loki? Can you fake Venom or Dr. Octopuss? No you can't. It has a history. Tons of stories. And then a writer can dare to wipe this all out with the full million dollar support of a studio...This is the mistake of the studios. You rely on the comic book heritage, the characters, the powers, the design and everything from the written/drawn world, then you decide to betray that whole thing. The most astounding achievement for Iron Man in this movie (iron man 3) was to save the fallen of the Air Force Plane, the rest was totally illogical, totally boring, totally useless. You need to understand, if you are creating a fantasy world, you set the rules for it to make the world believable and consistent. You can't cross the rules easily. Especially if you'r using technology and real world referenced things in your story. If you step on them you turn the whole story to a hunter story. No one believes it.Some serious questions about this movie:1- How did XTREMIS subjects earned super hero powers? Regeneration OK we got it. It was the end game of the whole research program but overheating was the setback, the main problem from the beginning of Maya Hansen's research. It was the reason of subjects going boom. This means that you can't overheat any of your part with your will power without booming yourself. In fact they needed Mr. Stark's genius to solve this problem according to movie! We know a guy from The Fantastic Four who has some kind of this ability(heating his parts whenever he wants) and it consumes tremendous power. Let's pass this question, how come they have super strength? Or agility? They were like super heroes... We know that the armor of Iron Man is physically super strong, with tons of pressure power etc. How come a regenerative body can overcome it? 2- How come the official US Army suit, the one that Colonel James Rhodes used has no tracking signal, a super coded emergency communication line with the main base? Is it that easy to capture a super weapon? Don't play with us...3- From what I understand Aldrich Killian and his company is expert about human genetics not super-war suits or electronics, and from what I understood neither Killian nor Maya Hansen is as genius as Mr. Stark so Killian can not capture or even move with an Iron Man suit. Everything has a learning span.4- Let's say that somehow they captured the suit, how did they learn to fly it remotely and with a decent precision while the president sitting in it? What was the command center doing at that time? Christmas vacation? In the end this is the most important mistake of a country losing a president, isn't it? 5- There's a command chain in every army. If you find out the whereabouts of a 'lost president!' you don't call the vice president, you call a special Defcon alarmed SHIELD base or your superior who is a military grade general or someone to mobile some 100s of agents, choppers, jets etc.6- I am not talking about the nonsense of only 2 men fighting with tons of enemies etc.. etc..There are lots of things to question this movie but Mandarin was the peak. In my opinion you have the material to make great movies from these super hero characters that can become legends but instead you are wasting their potentials with lose scripts, great illogical mistakes and disrespectful approach to their saga.Final word: One more million dollar disappointment. Note: There are movies like Rambo, Die Hard that we know that the heroes over there showing joke like super performances. But the concept tell you that these people somehow can do that and you believe that. Iron Man saga depends on the genius of a character and mainly the power of a suit. We wanted to watch this instead of Stark roasting enemy heads with a home made glove. That's why it is disappointing.",1,14,28,8 May 2013
Man of Steel," Masterpiece
","It is a great masterpiece after years of disappointment. After Batman: The Dark Knight this is the second best superhero movie I've ever watched. This is not a pop movie, Superman saga greatly and very deeply analyzed and produced in this film. It has an epic, literature understanding which will give you goosebumps while you watch it. Do not expect a funny, pop movie, instead you will welcome a perfect psychological digging effort covered with a precise and delicious action scenes. Unlike other superhero movies, classical propagandist American patriotism is very limited in this production which gave back Superman the mission of savior of all humanity not only an American symbol. You will have the chance to watch the real potential of a superhero with a great detail of satisfying action scenes. Especially the acting of the whole crew is perfect. There is not a bit of an overacting in any of the characters. I loved it for sure and strongly recommend you to watch this movie.",10,5,11,18 June 2013
