The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn - Part 1," finally another close approach to the book
","OK, I know many people for some reason didn't like this movie but i don't see how. i was thrilled to finally see almost exactly what i had imagined. perhaps they just imagined differently? Aside from the first movie, this one was the closest to the books they've done so far. Only thing I would've changed would be the wolf mind chatter a bit less unrealistic (those synthesized voices are sooooo 3rd category dumb movie), and the part where Bella is in agony and can't move because of the drugs could've been emphasized as much as it was in the book. All in all, the core of the first half of this book was romance, drama and horror. They did OK with the romance (Rob and K are so comfortable with each other that some of the tension that made them stand out wore off), perfect with the drama (gotta take my hat off to Kris and the guy who plays her father, they were Awesome!) but were a little sloppy on the horror, perhaps due top the damned PG13 rules.oh and dialogues! they should've allowed for more improvisation. Some sentences clearly were forced on the actors and don't suit them at all.but despite all I loved the movie, it was exactly what I expected ;)",8,4,10,22 November 2011
