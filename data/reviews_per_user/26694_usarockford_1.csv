Blade Runner 2049," What a disappointment.
","I am one of the biggest Blade Runner fans on the planet. My license plate reflects that. I had no intention of watching another 'Blade Runner' movie, since, well, it was done. But when I found out Harrison Ford was attached to the project, I knew it had to be something special. He had vowed he would never reprise that role. I wish he hadn't. This movie is a lot like the book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep'. Things randomly happen for no apparent reason. It is completely disjointed. It played like a script by committee. I was going to wait to buy a DVD box set until this was added. I won't anymore. This will never be be a classic. 3 hours of my life I will never get back. It was pointless.",2,19,39,15 October 2017
