The Devil's Advocate," I don't know what the rest of you are talking about...
","This is a beautiful film.  Even Keanu (sp), who can quite often lull into the Bill & Ted Acting Method, seemed to come through (particularly during the scene with his wife in the hospital).  I have to say that Pacino was fantastic; right up there with his performance in Heat or Scent of a Woman. The last 30 minutes of this movie grab you by the ear-lobe and punish you for not understanding what good filming and acting are all about.  Take another look at it.  Fine acting and fine writing.  How many of you would've chosen as he did?...I wonder :) That was the least believable part, I thought.  But the bottom line:  Own this Movie.",Null,1,2,4 October 1998
The Big Lebowski," great fun
","I thought is was great as well...not even close to Raising Arizona...but still good.  John Goodman outdid himself in this one!  He was in his element for sure.  And, it's always good to see Julianne Moore (oh yes).",Null,1,3,17 August 1998
Independence Day," ya gotta love it...
","I have a friend that just despises this movie.  Plot holes.. Stereotypes ... yes.  Blah blah.  This is a great movie.  That's all there is to it.  When you sit back and watch it, you are extremely entertained. It wasn't dead serious like it needed to be to achieve the Truly Great Film status.  But, gawd, bravo to Emmerich and Devlin for that 9 minutes of utter destruction.  That was terrifying (even though the woman, child, and dog shoulda been toast).  And of course, the FX were astonishing.  Come now, if Star Wars were released for the first time tomorrow, would it be as good? Take another look....  I can tear apart the Star Wars trilogy the same way my friend does ID4...but for some reason, the SW trilogy has some form of critical immunity when it comes to these issues...why?  Because , like the Bible, pioneering era-marking things are never questioned for some reason or another.  Hehe.  Geez, I'd better stop now.  It was a great movie.  There ... my two cents worth.",Null,1,3,22 September 1998
Saving Private Ryan," very few...
","I gotta say, that after reading some of the comments already posted, that i 'm amazed at how many people watched this movie and proceeded to critique it for its plot, enjoyability, etc.  This, like Schindler's List, I think, is a movie to be absorbed rather than just plain watched.  After watching this movie, i walked around for days with a kind of 'hangover' following me around...i was extremely moved by it.  When somebody asks me what i thought of it, i say 'i think of it alot'.  The battle sequences were absolutely horrific - and not because of the gore so much as the terrifying realization that these people (war veterans - both deceased and still alive) did this for their country...this horrible, traumatic experience,... most were very young and weren't expecting what they got.  The terror must have been unlike anything my generation will ever know.  Most people today feel panic stricken when the cable goes out just before their favorite episode of (fill in the blank), c'mon people ... take a hard look at this movie! TERRIFYING.  Very few movies  have achieved in me what Private Ryan has.",Null,0,0,2 August 1998
Titanic," bravo
","Firstly and foremostly, I am a guy, which (in most cases) means I did not go see Titanic to see DiCaprio...although I think he can be a great actor.  Reading through earlier comments, i grew a bit weary of hearing about lame script and shallow characters.  I went to see a ship sink...the plot and the characters were, at least to me, a kind of icing on the Cake.  I actually think a lot of the characters were done well; that is, by the time they die in freezing water, you actually felt a tinge of sadness for them.  But , by the time Titanic was over, I was sufficiently moved to make me tell people that it was a great movie.  Kate Winslet was good, Kathy Bates was perfect, Leo was ok (I'll give you people that - I've seen him shine like I know he can ... Basketball Diaries, Romeo & Juliet).  But ultimately, the Titanic sinks...and it was absolutely stunning.  Bravo to Cameron.  He didn't just show us a large ship sinking, he showed us the back half of it crashing down on a hundred freezing, drowning people; he showed us a third class mother attempting to sing her children to sleep because she knew they were all doomed (broke my heart - i cried the most right there at that point), he showed people who worked extremely hard to get OUT of the bowels of the ship only to be sucked back in when a random window shattered and the water carried them on back in...detail.  I like detail in a movie.  Very impressive job.",Null,636,883,9 August 1998
Tombstone," excellence
","A very impressive western.  The cast was fabulous.  I think Kurt Russell was phenomenal as well as Kilmer.  Michael Bein (sp?) seemed to be the same character he always is, just with less shave and more dirt (though I like him, don't get me wrong).  I wish they'd release this on VHS in letterbox format so I could finally buy it.",Null,0,0,30 September 1998
Heat," absolutely stunning
","You really have to give it to Mann for this one.  Impressive direction including the score and lights as mentioned above in other comments; as well as incredible portrayals by some of the greatest faces to ever be filmed. Pacino is at his best in Heat with his quiet-to-loud-in-2-seconds demeanor. 'Ferocious aren't I?'  That line sums up most of the characters he's played that we've loved.  De Niro comes through as quite possibly one of the most beautiful characters I've ever seen written.  The beauty of this film is how it blurs the line between right and wrong or good and evil or whatever you want to call it.  You, as a viewer, just want it to work out for everyone, cuz you love them all.  But you know it can't happen...at least, isn't that what we were taught?...  Great film.  Had to buy it letterboxed and watch it a few more times and steal samples from it to put on my computer!  If you haven't seen it, then there's much you need to learn.  If you've seen it and don't like it, there's much you need to learn.  That's my two cents worth.",Null,0,0,22 September 1998
