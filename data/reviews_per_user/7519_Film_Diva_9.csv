Your Name.," Beautiful, moving, haunting, inspiring
","This is the first anime film I've ever seen, and I loved it. IMO It's best to see this film without knowing too much about it. Just let the beauty and haunting yearning of the characters sweep you along. The story is so compelling that I had to look up whether the place is real and if the major event in the film actually happened (they are fictional). It's also inspired me to want to learn more about some of the cultural issues and items featured in the story. Highly recommended, even if you're not usually into anime.",10,3,7,19 April 2017
Star Trek Into Darkness," Great fun with a great 'bad' guy, something for all to enjoy
","STID was much better than I expected. It is nonstop action with a ton of special effects, but what enchanted me was the humor and game-playing between and among the usual gang and the new 'baddie.' I loved that John Harrison is a master chess player, always several steps ahead of anyone else, and even after the end of the film, I'm left thinking that we haven't seen all his moves yet.Since some of the previews/trailers had dialogue that sounded cheesy, I thought the movie might be fun but corny or campy. On the whole, though, even lines like 'I will walk over your cold corpses' make perfect sense when you hear the context of what the character is saying. Anyone can enjoy this film, even if they haven't seen all or most of the other Star Trek pieces on TV or film. Check it out and have fun!",10,7,22,16 May 2013
The Prestige," Mind-boggling philosophical exploration of illusion and real magic
","Intriguing, wondrous exploration of illusions and science/magic, with much to leave the viewer thinking for quite a while after the end. Beautifully done--writing, acting, directing, design--all transport us to a fictional previous time and place.Very philosophical, yet enjoyable for those who just want to experience a good story.I only wish I'd seen this in a theater instead of on DVD. If it is ever re-released, be sure to see it on the big screen. I will. This is one film that almost requires repeat viewings to fully appreciate the nuances.",10,2,3,26 August 2008
Doctor Strange," A lot of fun! Great characters played by great actors
","Have seen Doctor Strange twice now, first in IMAX 3D, second on a regular screen. Go for the IMAX 3D if you can, but it still holds up in 2D. But this film should really be seen in a theater to get the full effect.Everyone in the cast is terrific, even those in smaller roles. More fun than I've had with most recent films--lots of action, good humor, very cool graphics.It IS an origin story, so some of the story is similar to others, but the settings, the new elements of magic, and the intersection with other Marvel characters and stories make it different enough to shine.Be sure to stay through all the credits. There is one scene mid- credits, but the more interesting one is after all of the credits have rolled. Check it out!",10,4,9,5 November 2016
Get Out," Get Out delivers laughs and chills
","Jordan Peele masterfully creates an engaging hero, a mysterious atmosphere, and an action-filled story that never lets up. Get Out is a suspenseful film full of humor. It explores a lot of social issues revolving around racism in the U.S. Get Out really isn't a horror film (which is what I thought it was going to be). I think Jordan Peele called it a social thriller, and that seems right to me.Get Out is for everyone. I saw this with a mixed audience, and as far as I could tell, everyone loved it. Because Get Out deals with how we treat one another, I think it's best to see it in a theater with other people. I'm sure it will translate well to a small screen, but it was great to see it as part of a group.",10,4,19,26 February 2017
The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo," So worth seeing!
","I was hesitant to see this film, since I loved all of the books so much. I was afraid that the film would be a big disappointment. No! This is a great film, although it seems to me that without having read the books, it might be difficult to 'get' everything.Another concern was the amount of violence that might be portrayed on screen. Again, no problem. It could not have been done better--only enough is shown so that you know exactly what is going on and can feel the anguish. But there is no gratuitous or unnecessary violence shown. Kudos to the director for making great choices and to the actors for their brilliant portrayals.The casting is superb. I know that some people do not like to see films with subtitles, but I am really wondering if the American version will in any way be able to even come close to the beauty and brilliance of this film.My recommendation is to read the books and then see this beautiful and haunting film, which provides another way to experience this intense, idealistic and inspiring story.",10,2,6,11 July 2010
The Imitation Game," Fascinating in many ways and surprisingly humorous
","The Imitation Game is a must-see. Perfect for those interested in history, technology, social conventions affecting groups (women, gay people, those with autism) and the struggles of visionaries way ahead of their time.I knew a bit about Turing from computer science studies, but was eager to learn more. While The Imitation Game does take some artistic license in dealing with the facts, it more than makes up for it by delivering an intense, thrilling and surprisingly funny drama with a tragic ending.The story covers the historical aspects of Turing's work and includes some glimpses of his earlier years in a beautiful, engrossing way, thanks to a stellar performance by Alex Lawther. Benedict Cumberbatch gives his best performance yet as the adult Turing, and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. I was pleasantly surprised by Kiera Knightley's strong performance as Joan Clarke; she movingly portrayed the struggles faced by a brilliant woman in a technical setting, and she showed the compassion and support that helped Turing endure some of his struggles.",10,7,13,20 November 2014
Inception," Must see in theater to truly appreciate the awesomeness!
","Some films absolutely must be seen in a theater. Inception is one of those rare films that will not be truly experienced without a big screen, the bigger the better (IMAX if possible), or else you will not feel as if you are in the... (well, you'll see).On a Saturday afternoon, the theater was packed with the most diverse audience I have ever seen: ages from early teen to people who looked as though they had not been to a theater in decades; all races; many, many ethnic backgrounds; male and female. And everyone seemed entranced from the opening scene, all the way through to the final moment, when the entire audience gasped in unison. (If you have seen Inception, you will know exactly what I am talking about.)Don't miss seeing a new classic be born. Enjoy!",10,4,9,17 July 2010
The Shawshank Redemption," So good, I watched it without the sound!
","I'm a big Stephen King fan, and I wondered if this movie would be a good adaptation. Some of King's work has been great on film, but others have not translated well. No fear. As others have noted, this is an amazing film that provides inspiration and reconnects the viewer with the inner core of humanity. The script is great, the directing is wonderful, and the performances are unbelievably good. To give you some idea of just HOW GOOD this is, the first time I saw it was on an airline. Problem was, the headset didn't work and there weren't any other headsets. The movie is so good that I couldn't stop watching it--and this is a movie heavy on dialogue. If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor. NOTE: It's even better with the sound!!!",10,2,3,29 November 2008
