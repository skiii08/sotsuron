Deepwater Horizon," Accurate
",After almost 2 decades on these rigs and 9 as a Rig Supt./Senior toolpusher the movie is about 90% accurate. There is an obvious challenge between the Company man and the Senior toolpusher as their mandates are different. I have seen mud coming out of the riser and blowing up the derrick - whomever consulted this did a 100% job and . . . . they listened. Incredibly well done.,10,6,10,18 February 2017
