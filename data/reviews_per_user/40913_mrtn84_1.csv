It," Entertaining. Not a horror.
","The Good: The child actors are great. The banter is often hilarious. The inter-human relationships are the main scare of this movie. The indifference of Derry citizens to events taking place and the ominous behavior of some of the parents are well presented.The bad: What happened to subtlety? The scenes with IT are way over the top. To me 'not knowing/having to fill in some of the horror yourself' is what makes a horror movie stand out. In the first IT films, you knew the names of the characters. With this production I was still guessing who was who at the end of the movie.Verdict: I was entertained by the movie. Despite IT not being a horror. Bit over the top where it comes to the clown. Missing some depth.",7,1,2,2 October 2017
