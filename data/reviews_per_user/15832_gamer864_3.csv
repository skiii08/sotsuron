Black Swan," there's way better than this
","The acting of Portman is fine and makes up for a lot of shortcomings in this movie. All in all, i do not believe this is a good movie.The major shortcoming is that it is not believable for a top dancer to behave the way Portman's character does. She has one or more mental illnesses and cannot defend herself ?? Apart from that, i found some scenes with Portman and the ballet director obscene. Does that need more explanation ? And it gets worse towards the end, when she embraces him after a good performance. Weird. The end of the movie is the moment you realized that you have wasted a lot of time in your life by watching this movie.Let's rate this movie 1/10 for showing some obscene moments and for a poor script, and because it's overrated.",Null,0,0,28 September 2011
Lost in Translation," more than this
","well, well, well. I'm not surprised by the reviews i read about this movie. 'Lost in translation': either you love it, or ... you don't love it that much. Well, i'm loving it. If you can relate to the sort of relations that are portrayed in this movie, you will love it. If you can recognize yourself in singing karaoke till 3 am in the morning, that will surely help in the rating of this movie. And about humor: i found it quite funny at times. Well, after reading lots of reviews, some negative things that are said about this movie might be true, but, in the end this is a movie about feelings: or you can relate to the characters or you can't. 9/10. Funny movie, interesting relations ... .",Null,1,3,28 September 2011
Inception," not that good
","First the good news. The movie contains decent action sequences. The acting is OK, some exceptions left aside.Apart from that, this movie is overrated.The characters are one-dimensional. The story is predictable. About acting, Di Caprio can you make believe everything, except that this is a good movie. The actors try to perform and get something out of the script, but sometimes you can see them struggle and that can not be the purpose.Score is about 9 at the moment of writing, that's higher rated than all movies of Hitchcock... Are you kidding me ?",1,32,60,16 January 2011
