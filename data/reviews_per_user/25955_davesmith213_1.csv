Requiem for a Dream," SEE THIS MOVIE NOW
","Ok kl0wny's, listen up. This is the most powerful and moving movie i have ever seen in my life, and ive seen mostly every movie. Forget traffic. Traffic made no sense, and was completely moronic. This movie on the other hand, gives a much more powerful and emotional look into the lives of 4 people who are each struggling with some kind of drug addiction. It is a mental rollercoaster, and makes you actually feel like you are in this movie. Again, it is the best movie i have ever seen in my life, without a doubt. nothing but 5 star review from me.",Null,0,0,24 May 2001
