Scarface," One of the BEST Films ever made
","Scarface is One of the Best films I've ever seen. Al Pacino delivers a Power house performance as the in famous Tony Montana. This is for sure Pacino's greatest role. I prefer Pacino's performance in Scarface rather then Godfather (Another Great Classic). There are Three particularly Superb Scenes in this movie. First, Al Pacino and his Friends go for their first exchange with the columbians and end up almost getting killed via Chainsaw. Second, Al Pacino is given a task, to help in a assassination, but a women and her kids get involved and Pacino's stuck with a dilemma. Finally the last Fight Scene was Brilliant. Say hello to my little friend is one of the famous speeches. Pacino shoot dozens of guys on his own in his mansion. The whole movie entertains, thanks to Pacino.",10,2,5,11 June 2006
50 First Dates," Best Sandler movie..Best Romantic movie..
","50 First Dates is a Wonderful movie, packed with plenty of heart warming romance and comedy. Adam Sandler gives a good performance in best movie yet. I'm not much of a Sandler fan, but i still watched this cos of Drew. I think Drew Barrymore is very sexy, and i decided to watch this. I think it is one of the Best Romantic movies ever made. I don't watch much romantic movies, perhaps thats why, i don't have the knowledge. It is very heart warming and the ending is amazing and Best if you see it for yourself. Drew Barrymore is very sweet as usual in her best performance I've seen. 50 First Dates is hugely underrated and deserves the recognition. This is a Absolute delightful movie, and worth the watch.",10,1,2,13 June 2006
Dawn of the Dead," The most entertaining Horror movies of all time
","Dawn of the Dead is a masterpiece of a horror films. I have seen many horror movies including Evil Dead, Hellraiser, Freddy movies, Jason Movies, Exorcist, Haloween and Texas Chain saw massacre. The List will go on, never have i been this entertained. Apart from Evil Dead, Dawn of the Dead is one of the most entertaining Horror movies ever made. Packed with lots and lots of gore, blood and violence, This is one roller-coaster ride of Fun. The 70s version was a Classic, but this version is Much better. The 70s dead walked very slowly, one step at a time. It will be easy for the survivors to escape. This version the dead run fast and attack their victim, making it tough for the survivors. Ving Rhames gives a good performance. I saw this movie first day at 11pm. Great experience to watch a horror film. A must see for horror fans.",10,2,4,12 June 2006
Oldboy," Oldboy is a Masterpiece.
","I first saw the trailer of the movie, and it sure looked good. I'm a big fan of oriental Action movies. Oldboy received good reviews, so i rented it out. It has a brilliant unique storyline, with a disturbing and shocking twist and ending. The movie is about a man that gets mysteriously kidnapped and finds himself in a room locked. Not a prison, just a room, with a bed and TV and he receives food. The days turns into years, and after 15 years he is suddenly released. He is given a phone and message on not Why did this happen to him, but Why was he released. Sounds a little daft, but for those who have seen this movie, if you think about it, it makes sense. It is absolutely bizarre and not for the weak hearted. Oldboy had some magnificent violence that was recorded excellent. There is a fight scene, where he takes on 15 guys on his own in a hallway. The 2 minute fight scene was recorded in one camera take, and looks brilliant. Great performances, I still recommend this movie to anyone looking for a challenge.",9,27,98,13 June 2006
Spice World," Stinker..Disaster..Worst film of the decade
","Spice World is an example of the worst movies ever made. Daft script, with no plot, Spiceworld is a copy of Moonwalker. The Spice Girls thought they can nick the idea of Micheal Jackson being chased by fans and make a full movie with this. I guess they were wrong, very disappointing movie. Obviously no professional acting skills, so you cant blame their immature acting. Full of unrealistic and annoying character, this is a disaster. You could tell when a movie is gonna be so bad, like Spice world. What where they thinking, when they made this film. If they expected it being a Hit, then they sure are .... wrong. I gave the movie a go, because of the very sexy Geri Haliwell. At the time, she was very Sexy, but even she couldn't save the film.",1,5,11,13 June 2006
American Sniper," American Doughnut
","Firstly, Clint Eastwood has acted and directed in Superb Movies like Gran Torino, Dirty Harry series and The Good. This time Clint went Bad and the outcome is Ugly. Clint is ageing so its natural to get dim. This film is about a guy that loves killing women and children, which is acceptable in USA as the murder rate and serial killer list in USA is high (Check wikipedia for facts). It makes sense for doughnuts to consider this serial killer a hero. Fortunately for this Serial Killer, although he mentions He loves killing in the film, He can get away with it because of his Job. He kills people because of voices in his head, sorry, i meant he was told to by a voice in George Bush. Its no secret, The whole world knows apart from Doughnuts what Propaganda is. This War was a disaster and lots of injustice towards women and children but who cares. Doughnuts have been brain washed to hate certain races and its no surprise that doughnuts will enjoy this biased ridiculous film as you can hate certain races in this film.I give this film a 1 out of 10 because i found the bit funny when the US Soldiers go to the enemys house, The enemy would mix toilet stuff with food and serve the us soldiers. They were dumb enough to eat it.",1,7,30,21 May 2015
Predator," One of Arnie's Greatest Film
","I have seen Predator over 20 times, and never get bored of this. It is one of my first Arnie Movie, i grew up watching. It is a brilliant mix of Action, Sci fi, Horror and fantasy. The Predator creature is a great idea, much better then watching Aliens. The Death scenes are amazing and very entertaining. Arnie does a brilliant job as the main lead, Glad he never made the boring Sequel. My favourite death scene is when Carl Weathers gets his hand burned off. I was looking forward to Alien V Predator, but was hugely disappointed. Part One was far more greater the the Second. This is one hell of a Entertaining movie and worth the price. The Second best Schwarzenegger movie after Terminator 2. Overall, a Must See for Arnie Fans.",10,1,2,12 June 2006
Pitch Black," Deasel is So Irritating in this crap movie
","When i first saw this DVD, i expected a good movie. I usually don't put subtitles, but i have to this time. Why? because the way Deasel talks in this movie, you cant understand what he is saying. His character is so boring and annoying and is over acted. The characters in this movie do not suit with the plot. Some Muslims, some other people and Vin Deasel all on the same flight. Vin Deasel gives a disastrous performance in this so called horror film. Why does he talk in that stupid way, it annoys big time. Overall this is a dull movie and reminds you of Ghosts of Mars with Ice Cube. I do not recommend this movie to anyone, the sequel sucked and so does this.",1,6,14,23 June 2006
American Beauty," Funniest Film of the Year
","American Beauty is one of the Funniest Movies of the year. Kevin Spacey delivers yet another superb performance. Kevin has given us great performances in the past like L.A Confidential and Usual Suspects. This time, he plays a middle aged suburban man, bored with life. The film tells the story of his life, just before he dies. Annete Bening in a fabulous role plays his wife, having an affair. Thora Birch is Kevins daughter in love with the weird kid next door. Mena Suvari is the highlight of the film, with the famous red flower bath scene. Mena looks incredibly sexy playing the girl with dirty intentions. The funniest scene is when Kevin catches his wife with another man in a driveway. He tells the guy, I'm sure you'll remember my face this time. Great stuff",10,1,4,13 June 2006
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Simply the Best Arnie Movie..Fantastic
","Terminator 2 is no doubt the Greatest Schwarznegger movie of his career. Arnie has given us great movies before like Commando, Predator and Total Recall. Arnie will always be Popular for his role as the Terminator. Terminator One was a great Movie and a Great Start the made Arnie a Star. Terminator 2 went 10 steps ahead to make one of the Best Sci Fi Movies of all time. Over 2 hours of non stop entertainment. I remember when i saw T2 when it first came out in 1992. At that time, the graphics in T2 were out of this world. Everybody wondered how did they do that with the T1000. If you see this movie just recently, you wont be so surprised. It was the movie everybody was talking about in school. T1000 was a great Villain, its a shame the creaters on T3 couldn't compete with it. T3 was the worst out of the trilogy. Arnie was like a side kick in T3. T2 is one of the finest films ever made. Must See",10,7,10,12 June 2006
Face_Off," Excellent, Great Movie that Entertains Big Time.
","Face Off is a spectacular Great ACtion Movie from director maestro John Woo. After many Blockbuster Hit movies in Hong Kong like Hard Boiled, The Killer, Bullet in the Head and A Better Tomorrow. John Woo started his Hollywood Career with Hard Target and Broken Arrow. It was his Third Movie that is his Best work in Hollywood. Face off has some Powerhouse performances from both John Travolta and Nicholas Cage who equally gave us a Brilliant performance. It is very hard to say, who acted better in the movie. Its like judging Al Pacino and Robert De Niro in Heat. They both had an equal amount of work, and had to act as each other, since they have a face off. Face Off has some Great Action scenes, with breath taking stunts. This is a must see, if you enjoy Action Movies. This is for sure worth the price.",10,3,4,12 June 2006
The Usual Suspects," BEST Thriller movie in the world.
","Usual Suspects is one of the Best Mystery Thrillers in the world. It contains one of the greatest endings ever seen in any film. When i first saw this film, i understood 85% of the film. I had to watch it again, to recap on what happened earlier. After the second time i watched it, i realised this is a Superb movie with a fabulous twist. I have now seen this film about 20 times and seems to get better every time i watch it. Kevin Spacey delivers the greatest performance in his career. Gabriel is great, Benecio delivers a great performance with humour. Stephen is quite good in his best film. Pollak was impressive, Chazz Palminteri is a Superb underrated actor. Chazz looks ultimately smart and supposingly is a intelligent investigator. But Spacey turns out to be 10 steps ahead. Superb, brilliant and any other great ways to describe this film.",10,101,144,16 June 2006
The Football Factory," E N T E R T A I N I N G at times....
","I'm not such a big fan of British movies. There have been a few good movies like Lock stock and two smoking barrels, Snatch and some of the James Bond movies. I didn't expect it too be good, but it was very entertaining. It deals with a never before seen in a movie topic, Football Hooligans. There also has been another release the following year Green Street Hooligans, which was a Great Film. Football Factory does entertain and is packed with Violence and Humour. The problem with this movie is it promotes Hooliganism in some ways. They made it look like its fun to be a hooligan and its fun to beat up people. Yeah, its fun to watch it on DVD, I enjoy watching violence, but a movie should point out a message. Green Street Holigans worked, because the ending had a message. Football Factory narrates to us Is it Worth It? and at the end, the answer is Of Course it Was. It's funny, but can be a bad influence on some people. The acting was decent. Danny Dyer delivers a good performance. Frank Harper tries to act like Joe Pesci in Casino/Goodfellas and does a good job of it. This movie is a good time pass",8,6,12,12 June 2006
Dumb and Dumber," Funniest Film of the Century
","I have seen Dumb and Dumber over 20 times. It is in my opinion the Funniest Film of all time. I cant think of any other movie, that has made me laugh over and over again. This is a very intelligently made slapstick comedy from a great director. Jim Carrey delivers a Superbly entertaining performance, I really hope he makes more movies like this. We have seen Jim in many Funny movies including Liar Liar and Ace Ventura. This is his Funniest film out of the lot. Jeff Daniels gives another comic performance, in his Best film of his career. The movie is full of Jokes, it is impossible not to laugh. I have seen many films that made me laugh like Scary Movie, Hot Shots part deux, My cousion Vinny, Kung fu Hustle etc. If you haven't seen this movie and enjoy comedy, then no doubt this is a Must See.",10,1,3,12 June 2006
The Evil Dead," Best Horror Movie of all time.
","I have to give Evil Dead a 9/10. It is a great Horror movie, that was low budget, but Scary enough to please the audience. Its a typical storyline, where as usual you see a group a American Friends driving through the forest and crash their car. This has been repeated in 100s of Horror movies. The situation where a group of friends are stuck in the forest. In this movie they find a house, and decide to spend the night. But there is something Evil following them. One of the memorable scenes in this movie is when the girls are playing Cards. They have to guess what card the opponent is holding. One of the girls that catches the Evil Spirit starts reading out loud all the answers without looking. As her voice starts sounding creepier, her friends look at her surprised. She Turns back to look at them and they get spooked, because she has turned into a monster. The make up on the monster is terrific, Its amazing how they spent very less to make this movie and the movie is known as one of the Best Horror Films. There is a trilogy in Evil Dead series. The Original was the best, the second was comic and the third was a fantasy adventure. Surprising good stuff.",9,1,4,12 June 2006
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Best Tarantino Movie..Violently entertaining
","I was never a Big fan of Quentin Tarantino, I believe he was overratted. His earlier movies Pulp Fiction, Reservior Dogs and Jackie Brown were Decent, not Great. I know a lot of people will disagree, but There are far better Movies by Scorsese and De Palma. I wasn't expecting much from Kill Bill, i was wrong, It was one of the Best Action Movies I've seen. Kill Bill is a tale of revenge, packed with Lots and lots of Violence and blood splaterring entertainment with humour. Uma Thurman delivers a Superb performance, her Best film of her career. Volume One is more based on Two Villains. The main being Lucy Lui, who is the new leader of the Japs. Lucy gives a deadly and Amazing performance. There is a side villain, a School girl dressed Sexy Japanese girl, who also gave a deadly, fun performance. The fight between her and Uma is terrific. The highlight of this movie has to be the Amazing but unrealistic fight scene with Uma taking on the crazy 88. that is a gang of 88 samurai fighters. Unrealistic, but very very Enjoyable. Volume one is better then volume two. Part Two has a few Great moments, but is slightly slower then the first. Hands Down, this is a Amazing, great Movie.",10,1,5,12 June 2006
The Dark Knight," Excellent, Fantatsic and Superb
","Dark knight is the best film I have seen in years, it really is that Amazing. It is the greatest film in Hollywood of all time in my opinion. It's the only film I saw in Cinema more then once. Heath Ledger as the Joker just makes 50% of the brilliance in this movie. Best villain acting I have ever seen in movie history. Heath Ledger delivers one of the greatest performance ever. The opening scene bank robbery is terrific. Jokers dialogue why so serious and make up are marvellous. He makes Jack Nickolson's classic Joker look like an amateur. Oh and the remaining cast were also good Batman, Alfred, Two face etc.",10,2,9,29 September 2008
Avatar," Storyline is similar to real life wot America has done
","Storyline of Avatar is very similar to what America has done to innocent countries over the years. If you are foolish enough not to understand i am talking about all the invasions. The first invasion against the red indians killing them off. Then Vietnam for no damn reason and many others and the recent Iraq. I am not trying to create hatred guys as i am not saying Americans are bad. I am just saying that the leaders of this so called lovely country have F'd up the whole world. Using many tactics such as rape and violence against civilains and mind games, in other words Ignorance among people.Coming to the point The Film. Yes it was a great film. Peace",8,2,7,31 January 2010
Pulp Fiction," Highly Overrated..Suppose to be a Gangster film???
","Pulp Fiction is the most overrated movie I've ever seen. Reservior Dogs had released and was the talk of the town. Average movie that talks a lot and is set in mainly one place. Pulp Fiction is another movie that talks a lot, and doesn't do much else. It is a 2 in a half hour long movie and calls itself a action gangster movie. There is hardly any violence in this movie, its just talking talking and more talking. No where near comparable then Goodfellas, Scarface, Godfather or Casino. Only a few jokes like Bruce Willas and Ving Rhames in their worst nightmare. This is more of a comedy gangster related movie like Lock Stock and two smoking barrels. That was funny.",8,11,23,23 June 2006
Man on Fire," Superb..The Alternate ending on DVD would of been better
","Man on fire is the Best Denzel Washington movie I've ever seen. It was the Best film of the year, and i was glad to see a Great Action movie after a long time. Denzel delivers a power house performance and deserved an award for this movie. We have seen Denzel in powerful performances in the past in great movies like Malcolm X, John Q and Training Day. Another surprising actor was the little Dakota Fanning. We have seen Dakota in I am Sam, Hide and seek and War of the worlds. Dakota gives a excellent performance and the chemistry between Denzel and her is very heart warming. Christopher Walken is good in a supporting role. This is Tony Scotts Best movie he has directed. The violence is superb. The scene where he cuts of the bad guy's fingers is Superb. The bomb planted behind the mans private was very amusing. I have seen the alternate ending of this movie on the DVD. I think the previous ending would of been better. Those who haven't seen the DVD special features. The ending has Denzel going to the Voice's house and in a final confrontation, Denzel smiles as he pulls out his timer watch, with a bomb planted on him. He Explodes, killing himself and all the baddies in the house. But, apparently this scene was already featured in a previous movie. We have seen this sort of thing in Leon. Anyway, Man on fire is a Brilliant entertaining movie.",10,2,6,12 June 2006
Die Hard with a Vengeance," Brilliant Entertaining Movie..
","Die hard with a vengeance is a fabulous movie to watch. Over 2 hours of non stop entertainment, with action and humour. The difference between the three Die Hard's are the Third one has more adventure. I still agree that Die Hard One is The Best out of the trilogy, and the Best Willas movie. Part Two was good, but the weakest out of the three. Part Three has the most fun, as Willas joins with Samuel L Jackson together trying to stop Jeremy Irons from blowing up parts of the City. Bruce gives yet another enjoyable performance as the famous cop John Mcclaine who's always having a long day. Samuel is incredibly funny, as the racial electrician caught up with Willas. Jeremy Irons gives a splendid performance as the bad guy. The Best scene is when Bruce is forced to go Harlem, with a racist message. I didn't have a clue how he will get out of this one. Great Fun.",9,1,2,13 June 2006
Con Air," One of the best action movies ever
","Con Air is one of the most entertaining Action movies of all time. When i first rented this movie, the storyline sounded good and the review were great. I never knew much about Nicholas Cage, but this was a great movie. Cage delivers a Good performance as the convict who is finally getting out, but the plane gets hijacked by the cons. It was brilliant the way the plane gets hijacked. There are many films about hijacking like Passenger 57, Executive Decision, Turbelence and (You could include) Under Siege. Con Air is one of the cleverest hijackings of the lot. Con Air has many different Prisonors who entertain in some way. John Malkovich as Cyrus the Virus, is the leader and does a Good job of his role. Ving Rhames as Diamond Dog looks quite good. Steve Buscemi as Garland Green is Terrific. Danny Trejo as Johnny 23 gives a decent performance. John Cusack is the parallel lead and is amusing at times. Overall A Big Time Entertainer.",10,2,6,12 June 2006
The Lion King," The BEST Disney Cartoon ever released
","The Lion King is one of the Greatest Cartoon ever released. It has a amazing storyline, with fun characters. The Lion King is a non stop entertainer with a serious storyline. Bambi is regarded one of the serious cartoons. But in my opinion Lion King is 100 times better. It is generally better then the classic cartoons like Aladin, Shrek and Incredibles. Lion King has a Multi starrer cast for the voices of the characters. There are 2 sequels of Lion King. Part Two was quite boring continuing Simba's adventure. Part three was another part one in the eyes of Timon and Pumbaa. They are the funniest characters in this cartoon. This is a MUST SEE, even if you are not fond of cartoons.",10,2,3,13 June 2006
The Terminal," Heart warming and very entertaining
","The Terminal has a simple tale of a man stranded in a airport with a rare reason. He is not allowed to go back home and his passport does not allow him to enter America. He is left for hours, turning days and weeks. Tom Hanks delivers a Wonderful performance. Catherine Zeta Jones has a weird character, she looks Great. I remember when this movie came out in Cinemas, it wasn't that buzy. (I have worked in a cinema before). It is a very underrated movie and entertains big time. Steven Spielberg has given us great movies before, The Terminal is one of his greats. Tom Hanks has given superb performances in the past like Forrest Gump and Cast away. This is yet another delightful film of his, you can enjoy over again. It is a very intelligent comedy, which is hard to make. Overall, a Must See.",9,1,2,12 June 2006
The Matrix," Highly overrated..Very very slow film..BORING
","I know many people will not agree with this, but read this. Matrix is a hugely overrated movie and is so slow. The whole movie is about Neo trying to discover what the Matrix is. It can be explained in 5-10 minutes, but it is explained in almost 2 hours. The only good thing about this movie is 3 or 4 scenes of amazing graphics. If you like the film only because of these scenes, then you might as well just download the trailer. I saw the trailer and went to see the film, the good bits were in the trailer only. The movie is ever so slow, when does it end is what i was thinking. Keauna Reeves best film is and will always be Speed. Decent kung fu, but i prefer kung fu hustle.",7,2,7,23 June 2006
Casino," One of the BEST gangster movie ever made
","Casino is one of the greatest Gangster films I've ever seen. Martin Scorsese once again gives us a terrific movie, that has been directed Excellently. The movie folds around De Niro running a casino, and having marriage problems with Stone and Problems with a lot of things you can say with Pesci. Robert De Niro delivers yet another Brilliant Performance. Joe Pesci's character Nicky is similar to Goodfellas Tommy. Once again Pesci delivers a Superb performance as the violent Nicky. Sharon Stone looks sexy as ever and surprisingly delivers a Good performance. Casino Entertains Big time thanks to De Niro and Pesci working together. If you look at Pesci in Goodfellas and Pesci in Casino, which one is mightier. Both characters are Violent and a little crazy you can say. Pesci's Casino Character is slightly rougher then Tommy. Anyway Casino is a Must see, if you haven't seen it.",10,2,4,11 June 2006
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Highly overrated..Childish crap
","I don't know what is so great about this film that bores. So it was released in the 70s, that time there must of been better films. It has this stupid villain Darth Vader that irritates with his voice. If he is so powerful that he can kill with his mind. Why doesn't he just kill off the Heroes in that way, then wasting time. This movie is very childish, full of boring characters that annoy. There is a fight scene where Harrison Ford is shooting at 100s of Robots with lazer guns. Not a single shot gets him, how is that possible. I have worked in a cinema for over 2 years and witnessed the release of Revenge of the Sith. I am shocked that all these hundreds of people like this garbage.",1,97,240,23 June 2006
Sin City," The Best Movie of the year
","Sin city, is a Entetaining action movie with plenty of violence and dark humour. Set in the fictional city of Basin city, it has 3 in a half stories to tell. The half is Josh Hartnetts story, we don't get to see the full part. Story one is Mickey Rourke as Marv, The big tough guy. This is a Non stop Enjoyable story that kicks ass. My favourite of the trio, Mickey gives a Splendin performance. The Second story is with Clive Owen and the fight between corrupt cops and Hookers. Some great Samurai fight scenes in this story and also entertains. The third story is Bruce Willas and his fight against the paedophile. Another Great story, all courtesy of Frank Millers Sin City. Robert Rodriguez has given us great movies like Desperado, From Dusk till Dawn and Faculty. This is one of his Best work. A multistarrer movie, in black and white with some red for the high amount of blood. Elijah Wood looked incredible, I thought he only suits in geeky roles, guess not. Jessica Alba looks very sexy in the club dance. Overall fabulous movie",10,1,4,13 June 2006
Goodfellas," The Best Gangster Movie.
","Goodfellas is The Best Gangster Movie I've ever seen. Martin Scorsese does a Fantastic job by giving us this Genius of a movie. Robert De Niro is great as usual in a Superb performance. Ray Llioto delivers his Best performance in his career. Joe Pesci was Fantastic, half the movie's entertainment was because of his character Tommy. Lorraine Braco was efficient in a key role. There are many other supporting actors in this movie including Samuel L Jackson. This deserves to be at least in the Top 5 Best Films ever. Goodfellas has great acting, Great direction, good script and dialogues. The Violence has been portrayed amazingly. If you want 2 in a half hours of Entertainment then watch Goodfellas.",10,1,5,11 June 2006
