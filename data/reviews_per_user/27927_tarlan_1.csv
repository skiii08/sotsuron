The Rock," An exciting, action packed film with a difference.
","'The Rock' is an action film with a difference. There is emphasis on character, what makes each of them tick - and I'm not just referring to the characters at the top of the cast list. These little asides add a new, and welcome, dimension.Each and every character is given depth, from Hummel, the General mounting the threat to San Fransisco, to the FBI agents who are supposed to be guarding Mason.High points - Michael Biehn as the tough Navy SEAL Team Leader who refuses to stand down, crawling through the carnage as his team are being massacred, still firing.Sean Connery and Nicolas Cage in that fantastic car chase.Ed Harris as the General with a conscience who eventually pays for including unknown/untested men on his own team.Every actor in this film put in a top-notch performance turning what could easily have been an unexceptional film into something well-worth adding to anyone's video collection.",9,1,1,1 June 2000
