Angels & Demons," Good movie, bad novel adaptation
","If you see the movie without having red the novel you would think it is good but the plot, story, characters, ambiance are all missing. Vittoria who in the novel is deeply in love with Langdon is cold as ice in the movie. The all powerful assassin of the novel looks like a geek.The wrong pope gets elected. We don't see Langdon falling from the chopper and Vittoria coming to his rescue. Also the most important question where is Kobler who is the most important central character of the novel.Ron Howard is bad in transposing novels to films!",1,0,2,23 December 2018
Man of Steel," Violent beyond belief
",I did not like this Superman movie. It is laced with unbelievable violence and this movie should be a PG 14. It is not the superman I remember from movies with Christopher Reeves. Not my cup of tea,1,1,4,19 September 2019
