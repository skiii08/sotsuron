The Blair Witch Project," A truly terrifying film
","The Blair Witch Project is, in my opinion, one of the best horror movies due to it's realistic setting and eerie environment. The found footage format makes the scares unpredictable and terrifying. The film follows three people on a mission to learn about the Blair Witch, an urban legend of sorts in the woods of Maryland. It is shot entirely with hand-held cameras and equipment that would realistically be used for a low budget documentary like the one Heather, Josh, and Mike are trying to make. It almost feels like you're actually there in the woods since the camera shows the characters' perspectives.Perhaps the most terrifying moments are when the characters see something but the camera is facing away so the audience can't see what they saw. The mystery is one of the most compelling aspects of the film. The characters aren't focusing on getting the perfect shot when they're running or scared, so the camera ends up showing their feet or the blurry scenery. This creates a very disorienting feeling that adds to the ambiance.The film has a lot of subtlety. Plot points are briefly mentioned by characters who are interviewed or one of the main three throughout. As the mystery of the woods is slowly revealed, you can see more and more references to the urban legend found throughout the woods. Some things you won't even notice unless you re watch the film a few times. It's especially scary when the characters don't notice certain connections to the legend that are playing out around them.All three main actors do an excellent job acting naturally as if it isn't a movie at all. Their reactions seem very genuine and real. In some parts their reactions actually very real, since the director told them very little and would leave them alone in the woods for periods of time. The dedication to creating a realistic horror film is truly astounding. The final scene is one of the most terrifying moments in the film. Josh's screaming is heard while Mike and Heather run through a creepy house. Viewers are terrified about what will be around each corner. The film then ends with Mike going into the basement and dropping his camera. Heather then enters the basement to see Mike facing the corner- a reference to the Rustin Parr story mentioned earlier- and she is knocked to the ground. The camera runs for a minute and stops. This ambiguous ending leaves so many questions and makes for an excellently terrifying end to the film. The Blair Witch project created a truly terrifying atmosphere that remains scary to this day. I have yet to watch a film that comes close to the level of eeriness in Blair Witch. This is a classic horror film that is guaranteed to leave audiences feeling uneasy for years to come.",9,1,4,30 November 2016
Elf," A heartwarming, hilarious film.
","Elf is essentially a Christmas classic nowadays, and for good reason. This movie is funny, sweet, and extremely quotable. The film follows Buddy the elf on his quest to NYC to find his birth father. It's a ridiculous concept executed very well. Buddy encounters many crazy characters and situations on his journey. He discovers the wildness of New York as he tries to adjust to life as a human.Will Ferrell makes a hilarious Buddy. His random screams of excitement and childlike joy make for a lovable protagonist. He is full of innocence and Christmas joy, making him someone you can root for and care about. I love this film since I grew up watching it and it still holds a special place in my heart. I make sure to re-watch it every year around Christmas!",8,1,2,26 December 2016
The Shining," A classic, chilling film
","Kubrick's 'The Shining' is a classic and still one of my favorite horror movies of all time due to it's excellent direction. Kubrick has a very interesting direction style; he likes to delve into the inner workings of characters' minds in order to tell a story from a more psychological standpoint. This is especially apparent in 'The Shining.'The film shows Jack's gradual descent into madness very well. Odd camera angles and lighting create a disorienting mood for viewers, allowing them to see that something is very wrong. The shots of the hotel itself also aid in creating an eerie mood, as wall hangings and room layouts sometimes change from shot to shot. The idea that the hotel is almost alive in a sense and is destroying Jack is very interesting.While I love this film for it's amazing atmosphere, the adaptation of Stephen King's original novel leaves something to be desired. As a fan of King's work, I dislike how much Kubrick changed from the source material. He discarded a lot of the character development and certain (even some major) plot points. The film is still very well done, despite the many differences from the novel.One of the differences in Kubrick's adaptation is Wendy's character. In the novel, Wendy is a strong woman who fights to maintain her composure and protect her son. In the movie, Shelley Duvall plays a very different woman; Wendy is very submissive and weak compared to her written counterpart. Duvall's performance is very good until her breakdown at the end of the film. Her terrified screaming just seems a little over the top to me. Overall, 'The Shining' is an excellent horror film that I still find frightening to this day. It creates a truly disorienting atmosphere that makes for an amazing cinematic experience. This is definitely a film that every horror movie fan should see.",8,1,3,30 October 2016
