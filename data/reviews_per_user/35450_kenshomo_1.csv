The New World," New World Gone Wrong
","This movie is the second worst I have ever seen, with the first being 'AI.' That movie failed on so many levels. This one lacked levels, and therefore failed merely in terms of acting, retaining interest, and believability. As 'second worst' movie perhaps it deserves two stars; someone else will have to add the other star, however, because after watching this movie I can't muster the strength.The most persistent problem in this film is, in fact, its star. Farrell wanders from scene to scene with a dazed look on his face, appearing uncertain, downtrodden, and (worst of all) dull. Yet we are to believe that without uttering a sentence, this lifeless soul and Pocohantes fall deeply in love, then overcome cultural and physical walls of separation to be together. And then... well, nothing really. The movie, as sluggish and spiritless as its hero, drags on for a couple hours while you are left wondering when something will finally happen.I watched this movie with three others. All of us found ourselves drained of humor and hope by its end. Don't let this happen to you.",1,1,5,30 July 2006
