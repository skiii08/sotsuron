It," IT was 'Bad' really 'BAD'.
","This movie is so boring and illogical, i don't understand why people are liking it so much. Every 5 minutes of the movie will have a slow dramatic approach towards some horrific event( which were a bit funny instead). There must be some research done why 100k people voted it for a score of 8. Trust me it's not worth watching, I normally don't have any problem with any kind of movie, but this, this was awful.",1,4,10,25 September 2017
