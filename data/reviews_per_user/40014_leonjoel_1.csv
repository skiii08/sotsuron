Walk the Line," Soul mate: not easy to find
","I guess all Joaquin Phoenix needs is just more patience on his road to the Oscar, although we have to admit that the academy award is somehow just a game and an Oscar is not the only way to prove one's success. Reese does deserve the award! I like the June carter she acts as: independent, strong and genuine...I was really touched by the love between Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash, but I did feel a little bit depression after finishing this movie: It is much more difficult to find your soul mate in your life! Besides, you will never know when he/she will appear. Johnny Cash had listened to June's songs for twenty years when they met in person for the first time as wife or husband of others. It had been almost another decade when they ended up their own marriage and got married!Time Wasted--I did flash on that song!!But how can we say it is Time Wasted? Will they cherish the precious thirty-five years if it is not that hard-won? Will the happiness and joy be that great if it is not after such a hard journey? Rough is the road that leads to the height of greatness..",10,0,0,14 March 2006
