Blade Runner 2049," Your memories of the past are real?
","How iconic was the first 'Blade Runner', how many creators it inspired to create new films in the science fiction genre, how many things it predicted, what philosophical thoughts it was conveying. Many fans of the first film expected to see something similar, but Denis Villeneuve introduced us his view of the universe, while retaining the spirit of the first film.Story. The creators of the film made every effort to keep the story in secret, and this was not done in vain. In order not to reveal the essence of the story, I just want to say that this is a story about how one way or another, everyone considers himself to be special. Director. Denis Villeneuve also brought us a lot of things that humanity is realizing in the near future. In most of his films Villeneuve touches on the theme of children, in this film he also devoted much time to the theme of parents and children. In fact, as some critics noted, the picture is very similar to Tarkovsky's work, the meditative narrative of the film allows us to reflect on philosophical questions: are all our memories real and is man really a supreme being?Music and visual effects. Despite the fact that there were two outstanding composers working on the film (Benjamin Wallfisch and Hans Zimmer), the music in the film is quite small and it is not remembered. Basically, all the compositions are very similar to each other and create an exceptionally tense atmosphere. A small amount of original music in the film partially compensates for the appearance in the film songs by Frank Sinatra and Elvis Presley. Unlike music, the film strikes a visual component. The film implements completely new creative design ideas, thanks to which you experience a real visual pleasure.The Result. In the end, we can say that Villeneuve did not turn 'Blade Runner 2049' into another remake movies, the main task of which is to tell the same story with modern shooting technologies to attract a new audience and sell toys. After watching the film i have a strong desire to see it again on the big screen.9 out of 10",9,9,21,5 October 2017
Avengers: Infinity War," Thanos and his enemies
","At the moment, marvel cinematic universe has 19 movies. Whether you like them or not, they create an important part of modern cinema. These movies bring a huge number of people to cinemas. Some of these movies are incredibly original and creative, some are not. But they all represent a pop culture of the twenty-first century. In the twentieth century, the Avengers were cowboys. An example of real space cowboys are the Guardians of the galaxy. Throughout almost the entire first film, each of the Guardians pursued only personal interests, just like cowboys do in most movies. Or the actions of Spider-Man I associate with Shane from the 1953 movie. Turning to the new film, I want to say that I like Marvel, like their characters, their ability to inspire children. But I also like a good movies and a few of the latest movies of the cinematic universe are disappointed me with a weak script and focusing on visual effects. Infinity War I liked much more. There are a lot of characters in this movie. A lot. Some of them reveal themselves on the new side, they surprise with their abilities. But there is one character, which is more interesting to watch than all the others, his name is Thanos. In each scene where Thanos is present, you can watch his motivation, his rage, his ability to love and kill. From the first minutes viewers are given to understand that this movie will be much darker than all the past, that this movie is not afraid to kill the heroes. Everything that happens in the movie reminds an incredibly expensive theatrical production. The heroes understand that they don't want to die and see the death of those who they love because of the genocide of Thanos. Thanos himself and his hunting for stones resemble Disney and how they buy more and more studios. In conclusion, I just want to quote the dialogue between Thanos and Gamora at the end of the movie. 'Did you do it?'
'Yes.'
'What did it cost?'
'Everything.'",8,1,3,7 May 2018
