The Lobster," My favorite film of 2015 and 2016!
","Wow what a great film that was completely overlooked by all of the American Award shows, most likely because it's a British production with no American funding. Colin Farrell's best performance to date, iconic to me, I have seen this film five times and find it amazing every time. If you love Black Comedies this film is for you. It's rare to find a film like this the has a fabulous 3rd act.. this film does. Give it chance!",10,2,4,25 April 2017
The Lost City of Z," Great cast, and epic story!
","I went into this film with no expectations because I knew Sir Conan Doyle wrote Lost World being influenced from this story. I was pleasantly surprised. The cast was great, some of the scenes were a bit brief but this could have been a five hour film if they decided to tell more of the story. Incredible cinematography keeps you in the adventure. The ending works great and ends the story nicely.",8,0,3,25 April 2017
