The Ring," Absolutely Riveting, an Improvement on the Original
","It's nice to know that occasionally, Hollywood CAN do it right.No doubt about it, THE RING is one of the scariest, most intense horror films I have ever seen.  And that's amazing, considering I'd already seen the original Japanese movie it's based on, RINGU, and pretty much knew what was going to happen all through the film and was still on the edge of my seat.  The screenplay by Ehren Kruger manages to faithfully retell the original film's story but add just enough new twists to keep you guessing.The story follows reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) on the trail of an urban legend about a cursed videotape.  Apparently, as soon as you finish watching the tape, your telephone rings and a whispered voice tells you that you have seven days to live; and at the end of seven days, you die.  Rachel is drawn into the mystery of the tape when her sixteen-year-old cousin drops dead, apparently a victim of the curse.Pretty soon Rachel finds the tape itself, and, being the reporter she is, she watches it and, sure enough the phone rings... and suddenly she believes.It's incredible how much more suspenseful this film is than the original, considering that it follows the same basic outline.  One way it does this is by adding new texture to each scene; what was eerie in the first film is absolutely frightening in this one.  And director Gore Verbinski's visual style keeps the tension building, with an almost total lack of humor (which is interesting in and of itself, considering all of his previous films have been comedies).To sum it all up, this is an amazing film you do NOT want to watch alone!",9,0,0,3 December 2002
Ice Age," Uneven, But Still Fun in a Cutesy Way
","Millions of years ago (or thousands, depending on your religious beliefs) a squirrel-rat forced an acorn into a crack in the ice, causing an avalanche that kicked off the Ice Age.At least, that's what this silly diversion of a movie would have you believe.And the comic relief provided by that squirrel-rat character (known as Scrat) as he repeatedly tries to find a hiding place for that acorn is the highlight of an otherwise uneven but sporadically funny, though at times mean-spirited family movie.After the Ice Age hits, herds of prehistoric mammals start migrating towards warmer temperatures.  A sloth named Sid (voiced by a lisping John Leguizamo) gets left behind by his family (not surprising, considering how annoying this odd-looking little creature is) and takes up with a brooding woolly mammoth named Manfred (Ray Romano).Meanwhile, a pack of sabre-tooth tigers led by the evil Soto (Goran Visnjic) attacks a tribe of primitive humans.  One human mother manages to get away with her baby, but is chased down by Soto's second-in-command Diego (Dennis Leary).  Soto commands Diego to bring the baby back at all costs.And wouldn't you know, the baby is found by Sid and Manfred, who decide to guard him and get him back to his family.Essentially a road movie without cars, the rest of the plot follows the adventures of Sid, Manfred and Diego in their trek across the tundra played mostly for laughs.  Which is why the occasional lapses into dramatic territory (such as the revelation of what happened to Manfred's family, and the rather violent end that comes to one of the villains) seem to come in from another movie altogether.The animation is good, but noticeably inferior to the similarly plotted MONSTER'S INC; but then I don't think they were going for realism here.  All of the characters look like three-dimensional cartoons.Overall, it's a passable time-killer with a few good laughs, and a storyline that's just predictable enough to keep you comfortable.Sort of like a comfy old coat that's been worn a few too many times.",6,2,3,4 December 2002
