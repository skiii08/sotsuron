First Man," surprised to see so many negative reviews
","It's probably the first time I review a movie but after reading so many negative reviews, I feel obliged to. I am a lover of 'calmer' space films such as Space Odysee 2001 (which is one my top- three- favorite movie of all times) as well as Sam Rockwell's 'Moon'. Also liked Apollo 13 but not as much as the first two I've named. Hated 'Gravity' which I found absolutely silly.This has probably been the first time I've watched a movie involving Gosling and I do understand the criticism of one- dimensionality that comes across within his acting. Also I understand the cricics of the flat soundtrack. But that's all I can agree with. Did this movie really need more? Did it really need more goosebumbs, action, happiness or drama? My opinion is no. It was absolutely stunning and hypnotizing in it's trepidation. It made my dizzy in the way I wished to become an astrounaut when I was a child. The fascination and fear... I always felt the same about it all when my father told me about this day the entire world was sitting in front of a tv. Older guy was sitting besides me in the theatre had tears in his eyes, told me about that day and sat speachless in his chair for a very long time after the movie ended.I personally never though about this human achievment in a glamorous way. I always connected it with fear and incredible braveness, pretty horrifiying for these astronauts families. I'm no expert of Armstrongs Biography but I think it is a very sensible portrait. Overall I give it a solid 9 for being so hypnotizing in it's plainness. Absolutely loved it. Loved it much more than overloaded 'Interstellar'.",9,2,4,20 November 2018
