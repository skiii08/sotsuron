The Blair Witch Project," Scary? no. Creepy? Oh god yes.
","This wasn't exactly a very scary movie, in my opinion, although it did catch me once or twice.  It may have been the audience in the theatre that ruined it for me.  It's hard to be scared when the people in the theatre think that the whole thing is really funny, and the man sitting behind you specifically has a laugh like a braying donkey.  I am sure that had I been alone I would have been scared senseless.  As it is, the movie was damned creepy. 
I think the one thing that creeped me out the most was that child at the beginning.  The one that one of the people being interviewed is holding, remember her?  I want to know if the child was supposed to be saying 'No!' and covering her mother's mouth like that.  If so, get that kid into some classes immediately..she was a damned fine actress :) 
Anyway, even if it isn't very scary, it is still excellent.  A very good piece of independent filmaking.Koishikawa Miki, The Mustard Girl",9,1,2,10 August 1999
Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," It's Star Wars. That's high praise.
","Contrary to what all the naysayers and 'Legions of People Who Hate Anything Popular' say, this movie is really very very good.  Jar Jar Binks is not nearly as omnipresent and annoying as some people make him out to be.  The Jedi sequences are all very well done, with the Jedi themselves displaying a nice range of Force Abilities that people who have played the Star Wars RolePlaying Game or even Jedi Knight: Dark Forces II will greatly appreciate.  I do not understand, however, the people whose main complaint seems to be that it was not dark enough.  Come on people, even Empire at its darkest never had any of the graphic violence you seem to be clamoring for.Very very good movie.  See it.  Love it.  Don't take it too seriously. Good though it may be, it is just a movie.Miki",10,0,0,20 May 1999
Mulan," Why cute mascots? Marketing!
","Mulan was pretty good for a movie from the Evil Empire (although as long as Microsoft is still solvent, Disney is only a distant second as Evil Empires go ;)  There were few songs, which I heartily approved of (I hate the songs) and the story was kinda nice.  I did have two major problem with it:1)  Why oh why does the main character of the story desperately require a 'Wacky' sidekick?  I will admit, the scarecrow riding a panda scene made me laugh, but other than that, Mu-Shu did nothing but make me groan.  Robin William as the Genie was funny, after that, and he was the only sidekick actually called for by the movie.  Every Disney movie thereafter has had to have one, and it is starting to grate on my nerves.2)  It was too dang short.  Nobody said animated movies have to be short! Put another scene in there!  Show Mulan and Gen. Shang getting married! It wouldn't have ruined the story! There is no rule against liberated women liking hunky guys!  And he was smart and enlightened too!  The movie was just too darned short for my tastes..I prefer the Studio Ghibli type of Animated movie, very long and very good..and NO SONGS! (well..usually no songs..) -Miki",Null,0,2,2 April 1999
Fargo," zzzzzzzzz....
","I am sorry, it may be a 'work of art' as some have suggested here, but Fargo is the most BORING movie I have ever seen.  You just can't care about the characters, the plot, anything!  The only way my friends and I could continue to watch after the first hour was to MST3K it, shouting comments at our TV screen that at least kept us amused. There was a whole lot of snow..a bunch of really 'meaningful' scenes including snow.  Some more snow.  Some person who was so pregnant she could hardly walk, but seemed just fine stalking down the rabid killer at the end...oh, and she was in the snow when she did it.  Then there was some more snow.  I think the snow had a really bad accent, but I cannot be sure, because eventually I couldn't even stand looking at the screen to see who was saying their incredibly banal and annoying lines. Fargo is boring.  Fargo is bad.  Never watch Fargo, not even to put you to sleep.  It just isn't worth it.",1,49,101,7 April 1999
Any Given Sunday," At This Point The Director Attempted an 'Artsy' Sort of Shot
","Don't get me wrong here.  This movie is definitely worth seeing..but good god save me from the artsy crap that Oliver Stone filled this movie with. I mean really..Shots of lightning arcing from the sky while the Quarterback and the Coach sit at a table eating Gumbo?  The Ben Hur chariot sequence? Please! Just show the movie!Oh..and I don't know about you, but I am really getting sick of the 'Let's attach the camera to the shoelaces of the Offensive Tackle and see what kind of shots we can get' school of cinematography.  Some of the game sequences are impossible to follow and give you a serious headache.Still.  It's worth the cost of admission.  Pacino is the man.Koishikawa Miki.",Null,1,1,27 December 1999
The Matrix," Not for the dumb :)
","Oh man, here I am waiting desperately for Star Wars to come out, and am suddenly blindsided by what is very probably the best movie I have seen since 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' (which is my favorite movie ever).  It is, if taken in its primal essence, an unsurpassed paranoia movie.  However, as anyone who plays the game Mage: The Ascension can attest:  It was good to see those Virtual Adepts giving those uppity Technocrats a good beat-down!  World of Darkness fans, this movie is a must-see.  Everyone else, go see it anyway.  It is just that good. Miki",10,0,0,5 April 1999
