The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," Sci-Fi - action or love story...???
","last Friday I got lucky to watch the premiere of Mockingjay Part I in my country.With excitement, I sat down and prepare for the action. the the movie played from the beginning to the end. I just sat down looking completely frozen and loss, just one thing comes to my mind 'am I in the wrong room or I slept while the all the action happened, or could it be that the operator played the wrong movie?' all I saw for 123 minutes was a love story. I recheck it to a friend of mine who saw it together with me and he replied the same 'it's a love story with a little tiny boom boom explode.'Where all the action that appeared in the last 2 movies? where all the action gone? for me personal, it becomes a love story movie, about triangle love of Katniss, Peeta and Gale. yes it's true that were a bit of action, but from my point of view that just become a time and place setting, no more no less. I come into my own conclusion, whether that is true Mockingjay has 2 story inside 1 novel (as Francis Lawrence stated from the news that I red) or simply just to gains more profit since the last 2 movies hits box office?as I thinking almost every movies that I watch always put a bit of romance in it. I am OK with that but 1 part 123 minutes only focus on the love problem of Katniss, Peeta and Gale. come on get real!this is just my personal opinion. Forgive me if I insult or offending someone for I don't meant to.",4,14,21,23 November 2014
Non-Stop," Puzzle action yet real.
","Just finish watching this movie.For me myself I like this movie. Good story line, best acting by Liam Neeson (starting following his movies after watching Taken).I called this movie as Puzzle action real movies.Puzzle Why I say puzzle. because it take us to wonder who the real bad guy is from 150 people on the plane. how the writer perfectly make a bad guy that can manipulate people into their bad side (willingly or not).Real Action Real action because it's not like stereotype Hollywood action movies, where the good guys can still stand after get shot, blown, thrown outside 2nd or 3rd floor, still can run after hit by a car etc. Real in a way that it use logic not merely action shoot bomb win. how the bomb procedure to down at 8000ft, no shooting the glass that ended up the body of the plane wreck in half but can still landing, people hit by the metal when the body of the plane wreck, etc. For me as an ordinary people all the events happened on the movies still can be regarded as logic.For me myself, I like this movies. because it makes us think, not just sit and see a lot of gun shot and boom everywhere. I like how the writer create the good guys, yet he's having problem with alcohol, family etc. and what makes me like it more that, no kissing or bed scene like almost every other Hollywood movies. I don't know what else to say rather than two thumbs up for Liam Neeson, The writer, all the cast and the director. Nicely done.Forgive me if any of my word insulting in anyway, since English is not my mother tongue.Hope my review can help others. Thank you.My best regards",8,0,1,2 June 2014
Avengers: Age of Ultron," Better story line, lots of laughter, far more better CGI
","Well lucky of me just finish watching Avengers day 2 of premiere here.I really enjoyed the movie. lots of laughter along the movie, tense down a bit from all the action.About the story line. Like the moments when all the superheroes was given false image by Scarlet Witch, I can see superheroes that are weak and more human (forget all the super power they have). For a second I though that Ultron wants to be 'human' when he tries to make human body with Dr. Cho; but when he says something about human extinction and the start of machine era, just pop in my mind is this Avengers or Terminator? Good part about Black Widow, we can know a bit about her past. a lovely surprise with the appearance of Vision. in the end when Captain America calls out the Avengers, it shows War Machine, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, could it be the next Avengers will focus on these new superheroes? Nice story about Hawkeye and his family, it shows us about a superhero that are considered 'weak' among the rest, but he didn't back off, rather than he fight beside the rest. The part when he protecting a child risking his own life and when Quicksilver loses his life to protect. here I see superheroes not always on the winning side.The CGI was amazing, almost can see the difference between the real life & animation.Overall I really enjoyed this movie. lots of lesson we can learn from the movie.",7,17,36,23 April 2015
Edge of Tomorrow," NOTHING TO TALK ABOUT - Movies to watch ONLY (don't use logic).
","Well happy to be the 1st or 2nd to watch this movie.Just finish watching this movie. 1st thing comes to my mind is I don't have NOTHING stand out to talk about.I mean yes at 1st the time loop was quite fascinating, but after several times, it getting boring. in several movies that have similar plot, each time loop will create a different story. Whereas in this movies, it just like when we playing FPS shooting games, we repeat the same stage and remember where all the enemies until we pass the level.The computer graphic itself, just like others film, nothing stands out.The story line just confusing and bit disappointment. Because with good actor like Tom Cruise, they can come out with better story line. Lots of question mark such as : - In the end, when Cage killed the Omega, he gains the time loop ability once more. But When he done time loop. he come back to he helicopter scene, it should be 2 day before he killed the Omega, but he came back form the similar helicopter scene but the Omega already destroyed? - Also when he gained back the time loop ability. it means that he becomes immortal. as long as he doesn't get any blood transfusion then he cannot died, every time he died that he just will be returned to the same chopper scene.lets cut to the end. My conclusion of this movies is that this is a Sci-Fi film. so just sit back and enjoy, don't use any logic to understand this film, or you just will ended up with disappointment.Enjoy the movie guys.* This is only my cent of the movie. Forgive me if there any of my saying that insulting in anyway, since English is not my native language. Thanks",4,16,53,29 May 2014
Lucy," Blur film, what type of movie is this?
","just finish watching Lucy. my first impression all X-Men ability in a single person.I am totally confused about this movie. can we call it action after all the gun fights, cars crashing and the bazooka? can we call it Sci-Fi because all Lucy'ability? can we call it thriller for the 24 hours time she has to find the rest of CPH4 in order to reach 100%. or is just a scrambled eggs movies. For me I found this movie blur / unclear. what I found is some scene in the movie that are funny, - The hospital scene, where Lucy walking easily carrying a gun, without any of the staff members, patient, people, or security realizing it?? - When Lucy reads Jang's mind, but she can read the nation name not from Jang's POV, but from his men POV. - When Lucy changed her hair colors in public, and everyone seems not noticing it, even the girl that near behind her. - When Jang's men put out a lot of weapons in front of the university and all the police that arrived closely not noticing it. - All the police that came to secure the university aren't there in front of the front security area, but suddenly appeared near the room where Lucy and the professors were talking.I can't yet give vote to this movie. perhaps I should watch it over and really pay attention to the movie.This is just my personal opinion. Forgive me if my review insult or offending someone, for I didn't meant to.",4,0,3,23 November 2014
