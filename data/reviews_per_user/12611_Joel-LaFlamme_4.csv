Moneyball," Pretty good but they missed a ton.
","Look I liked this movie, I of course knew everything about the team before going in so I had some insight that most won't, but I have to admit that turning Scott Hatteberg into a first baseman is not what won that team 103 games. They make a big deal about not being able to compete with the Yankees, but this team had the best pitching staff in all of baseball. I mean statically, not just in my opinion. Tim Hudson, Barry Zito and Mark Mulder all pitched over 200 innings with ERA's under 3.50 and this is during the steroids era. In the field they had Miguel Tejada 34 HR 131 RBI MVP winner, and Gold glove winning third baseman Eric Chavez 34 hr 109 RBI. But they try to claim that David Justice is there only star. And he was the one getting the screen time with Jeremy Giambi. They didn't look at why that team won, and who the key components were. They tried to play them off like a second rate team which just wasn't true. They never brought up what that team had to work with. Half way through the movie Brad Pitt trades away Carlos Pena for a pile of beans to make a point to the Manager. This in hindsight is one of the dumbest moves Oakland ever made, Carlos Pena went on to be an all star while Hatteberg stayed mediocre at best. The movie is funny and it shows the casual fan what baseball is about statistically, but they really missed out on some great characters on that team.",7,1,5,24 September 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Another 12.50$ sent to Davy Jones locker
","These movies have been trash for 6 years now. Rob Marshall proved that a new director isn't going to fix anything. I admit there is less CG then the last 2 films but the story is terrible and the characters are just as bad. The first 40 mins is spent reintroducing the characters. For some reason Jack has lost the Black pearl, no reason is ever given. Barbosa had command but lost the ship to Black beard, who keeps it as a prize in a bottle, with 30 other ships. We wait for an hour or so for Barbosa to explain why he lost the ship and instead of an amazing flashback to show Barbosa loosing his leg we simply have to listen to a horid story to sort things out. Black beard the king of the pirates has been relaxing somewhere for the last 3 movies, never brought up before not even at the pirate council in part 3. He sails another ship with ripped sails because that makes ships go fast of course.Penelope Cruz pretends to be Jack Sparrow and somehow every Pirate in London believes her, even though she's about 5'1, 95lbs. The whole story is about the fountain of youth, of course it's located on the same island as th first movie. It's just a few days voyage from the Caribean and there are no dangers to pass along the way. Just a few days of sailing and Barbosa, Black beard and some Spanish ass holes just find their way there. Only Barbosa has the map but that doesn't matter. They meet at this island and now have to catch a mermaid and get her to cry. Seems simple enough until Cruz says 'we need her tears fresh, mermaid tears don't keep.' This means they need ro carry the mermaid in a glass coffin filled with water. Then there is a scene where a rope bridge is broken and one of them will have to jump a gorge to make it to the other side. Penelope ants to go, Jack doesn't, so Black beard puts 2 bullets in 6 guns and has Jake pick which one to fire. Black beard then takes turns firing at Cruz. What this scene proves I'm still trying to figure out. Eventually Jack does it and I don't care.He climbs a huge cliff, then another just to find the ship of 'Ponts de lion' (spelling) waiting for him aboard the ship is barbosa, who has one leg, but somehow found his way up 2 cliff faces to get aboard this ship. They mess about for a few mins while the ship teeters on the edge of the cliff. The scene ends without the ship falling, maybe the first time in history where they forgot to pay off the set piece. It's a teetering ship on a cliff, hmm what should we do with it? I've got an idea, how about nothing?They get to the magic place, Jack says the magic words and a water elevator appears on the roof of a cave. Everyone take the elevator the the fountain of youth department, only to have the Spanish come and wreck everything because the temple is offensive to god. They smash everything then hit the road, never to be heard from again.Jack saves Penelope and black beard dies and I don't care. 3 big Indiana Jones rips offs, Jack and Cruz meeting is a ripoff of raiders when Indiana meets Marion ravenwood. She was a young innocent girl when the 2 met in the past. Bu Indana wronged her. When they meet again they hate each other but you know that romance is going to build.Voodoo doll from Temple of doom, this was so obvious it almost hurt.The entire story was about a magic cup and the magic water that gives you eternal life, at the end of the movie, Black beard drinks from the wrong cups and he dies the same way as the bad guy in last crusade, evaporates into a skeleton.This movie is just as bad as the last 2. I'm done, no part 5 for me. I've learnt my lesson.Not one cannon ball is fired, no ships do battle. The movie cost 250 million and they don't fire a cannon ball.",3,3,4,27 May 2011
Zombieland," Come on people, your better then this
","People, you are honestly killing the film industry, this movie was trash it wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining, no acting no story, bad effects, and rubbish cameos, in the tradition of other bad films like the hangover, and Ironman this film just throws a bunch of random scenes together through the convenience of a road trip. Movies like this are killing the industry and are the reason why i hate 80% of the films i see in theatres. Harrelson is a second rate action lead and the only thing i like about him is his sawed off winchester which is ripped off 'once upon a time in the west'.Eisenberg is a 4th rate Micheal Cera, the movie was probably written for Cera but why would he touch this hunk of garbage with a ten foot pole, Eisenbreg steps in and makes the character almost unbearable. The film is blown away by horrible cameos, like Bill Murray and mike Tyson in The hangover. What the hell is wrong with you people. I can't believe this actually exists on paper somewhere. The script was a piece of trash, the comedy was so stupid. I could write a better zombie movie in a weekend and one day i will. the only thing i enjoyed were the slow motion credits, they made me believe that there might be something to this film but then 30 minutes later and 0 laughs later i realized that the film was as good as the trailer, which was also a piece of trash. I'm tired of CG gun shot squibs, and acting which is supposed to be based on real life. Film is supposed to be escapism but todays audience is so stupid, story doesn't matter, just throw a bunch of stupid ideas together with no connection and we have a hit. Why are the girls going to a theme park? Maybe the worst idea ever. When Abigail Breslin is introduced we are meant to believe that she is infected and that her sister is going to kill her with a shotgun, that's a brilliant idea, kill off the 12 year old girl in the first 2 minutes by blowing her face off, that's a great idea, but no it's all a big trick. The flashbacks are terrible and I would gladly watch any Romero zombie film over this hunk of embarrassment, even diary of the dead and that movie was terrible. Friends of mine think this was a classic, to tell you the truth if you have a positive opinion of this film your wrong period, everyone deserves their own opinion but that doesn't mean that your isn't wrong. This movie was trash, absolute trash and as the fact that this movie did good means there will probably be 20 clones of it that suck too. Hitchcock and John ford would be spinning in their graves if they saw the current state of the film industry.",2,11,23,16 October 2009
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," The worst climax ever put to film
","OK so I'm a huge film fan and I've been on this Harry Potter ride for the last 11 years. Every film is just a piece of a grand puzzle that will all come to a triumphant conclusion. Well somebody forgot to tell everyone involved with the film. I have never been more let down by the end of anything ever. The main focus or my rage is to be focused on the 30 sec light show between Harry and Voldemort. Harry destroys all the Whorecruxes and finally faces off against the ultimate evil but now that his little trinkets are broken he's actually a pretty weak wizard. In fact Harry kills him in 2 seconds and he just melts away. We've been waiting for this battle for 11 years and all that happens is Harry's beam is stronger. No screaming, no yelling, no fight for their lives. Just 2 beams meeting and Harry's is better. You don't diminish the enemies power throughout the films. To build suspense you increase his power, making him nearly unstoppable at the end and somehow Harry must overcome the unsurmountable to succeed. Instead Voldemort is now weak and his super wand is busted. Splitting this movie into 2 parts was simply a tool to make another billion. They stretched out boring story telling for the last 4 hours of this series and they didn't even wrap up the characters. They just jump 19 years into the future and Harry Potter is just some guy with a wizard for a son. The most powerful wizards seem to all be pivotal parts of the wizard world but Harry is just some guy in a sweater vest.",2,17,34,17 July 2011
