Blade Runner 2049," Shouldn't have watched it (light spoilers)
","The only good thing is CGI.That says a lot. I don't want to get into the details too much, but this is what bothered me:1. The atmosphere. It was built horribly. Nothing that original Blade Runner did stayed in this one. The world is huge. But it isn't beautiful, it isn't real - reminds me of the world of Tron. We don't see any actual life in it, just a backdrop for a carppy plot, when Blade Runner's world was a aprt of the plot. Sound, light design is disgustingly bad. I mean, why even bother if you won't try at least reach the level of the original one.2. This is a weird one, but I was amazed with the this specific detail in Blade Runner - Replicants eyes have this 'glow'. It's subtle enough that noticing it feels like an achievement. This movie - threw the detail out of the window. You can try justifying it by saying that new Replicants have a different kind of eye. However, even Nexus 8 (still built under Tyrell) doesn't have that 'GLOW'.3. Oh, the plot. The plot. The plot! It's bad, it's really really bad. But writing about it is too much work and I don't have enough energy to complain about it. But I do have enough energy to complain about us, the audience, being dumbed down. Are we dumb? Are You dumb? Am I dumb? I believe not. Then why, for God's sake, why does this movie think we are stupid? They shove plot points so hard, like we didn't understand them the first time we saw them - we don't need the whole sequel telling us the information we got earlier, especially, when it's noticable and presented as an important info. OH, and also - the main idea is shoved down our throats. It isn't any different than the one of original Blade Runner, but here it is presented so obviously and so badly (holding our hands hrough every step of the way and not letting us come up with it on our OWN).I dislike this movie. Will never watch it again.P.S. When Joe lands near the orphanage, why do those people attack him? And why do their bodies dissapear after the bombing?",5,2,3,28 November 2019
Black Swan," Really enjoyed it
","Had a blast watching this movie.
The smart twists and turns really made this one stand out. I wouldn't say you could have never seen or predicted the ending - the clues were there. But this one was so masterfully crafted that you had to actually search for clues, they weren't shoved like in the 'Sixth Sense' - they were just there for you to find.A relief to watch a movie which doesn't think it's audience is a bunch of dumb children.",10,1,3,9 September 2019
Midsommar," A fun watch
","First of all, it's not that scary. The trailer is much more horrifying than the actual movie, however, the movie excels at painting 'the cult's' activity as the norm.
It's a gory movie, which perfectly depicts some parts of a psychedelic trip (as far as I've seen in recent media - the best at tripping's depiction).
A colorful and fun viewing. Not scary, justvisually gorgeous.",7,1,3,13 November 2019
Blade Runner," Visually astounding
","The athmosphere, created by Blade Runner is like no other. It not only immerses, but also creates a realistic world, which is strange to write, because I watched this movie in 2019.
I love, that it didn't explain the world too much, showed only the detail absolutely necessery for the story.
Visually this movie is 10 in my books - I'm a sucker for those (that's why Space Odyssey is my favorite move of all time).
However, performances lack. Rutger Hauer gave the best one - he is amazing, especially at the end. But others - not so much. The performances at times are strange, not following the characters. But from that side, overall, they don't take you ot off movie.
Also, the characters, their motivations, some actions or feelings they 'show' (sometimes they don't show any at all) are without any actual justifiable reason. That's why I give it an 8. Because of some ordinary performances and rare bad writing. Probably would give it less, but ohhhh the world they build - it's gorgeous.....",8,1,2,28 November 2019
Before Sunrise," Impressively good
","The thing that impressed me the most about this movie was the fact that it is genuinly different in a way it tells the story. It's done through talking, with eyes and quick glances. The camera shows absolutely enough to understand what is happening, because we've all been there.I like romantic movies. I am not a fan - if I want to spend some 'quality time', I'll watch a Kubrick or a Tarantino. For a quick, mindless watch, I'll choose a romantic piece. And that's how I chose this one - boy oh boy, I couldn't have been more wrong.It's slow paced, because the movie doesn't only tell their love story - it tells Them - their ideas, fears, personalities. They are people, with whom we feel a connection because of the talking.Maybe I loved this movie so much, because I have lived a similar day with someone I hold dear in my hearth, but not see anymore. I guess I just have a wish to see him again - and I continue my days with utter love waiting for those metaphorical six months to pass, doing everything out of pure love.I don't know, maybe it's not that good. But it hits the sweet spot alright, I'll tell ya",10,1,1,9 September 2019
