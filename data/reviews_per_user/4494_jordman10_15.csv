The Blair Witch Project," Nightmarish and truly frightening genius
","These filmmakers know what is truly frightening. People don't get it. People can not watch a movie and put themselves into a scenario and imagine how terrifying it would be to be hopelessly lost, having your friend disappear mysteriously and be awoken late in the night by his futile cries for help and knowing there is nothing you can do, and most terrifying of all being stalked by what you can't see. People don't like this movie because it forces you to reach into the deepest part of your mind and imagine what is stalking you. If you don't know what it is, you can imagine anything. That is what makes this movie so terrifying. This is brilliant and very well done. ***** out of ***** and for all you dumb mother F****** who don't like this movie. You are so dumb if I ever meet you I will slap you. Sometimes people make attempt to truly frighten you and you ignore because there are no f****** monsters in it. It was good but people are stupid.",10,1,3,26 July 2006
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Quite possibly the most hysterical movie ever!!
","This movie left me in awe. I think we've reached the brink of perfect. I took off school on Friday the third to see the premiere of this revolutionary comic gem. Everything was perfect. The pure fact that it was basically real was perfect as well. I myself am one who believes this, what is physical reality other than an appearance and a personality and I believe Borat to be real. Borat is a being created by Sacha Baron Cohen. Sacaha is Borats father. This movie was made by comic diligence and impeccable courage. This was a very bold move for Cohen, he took a very high step and really showed the world. He exposed anti Semites and taught the world that you have to be able to laugh. I believe that this movie is revolutionary and shows us that comedy is not yet dead but very very much alive,especially in Sacha Baron Cohen. ***** out of *****.",10,2,13,5 November 2006
Wayne's World," Best Movie Ever
",This Movie is my religion...literally. This is my favorite movie ever. I think Mike Myers and Dana Carvey make the est comedic duo ever. It also had great music i n it as well. The Alice Cooper scene was sheer brilliance just because Mike Myers 'Does This Guy Know How to Party or What!' line was perfectly timed. Dana Carvey was so funny i n this movie. It just had me laughing forever. I watch that movie routinely each night. Its that brilliant. I seriously recommend this movie to anyone from 4 and up. Its not to dirty. This is Mike Myers Best role. Dana Carvey is a great drummer as well. I think it deserved an Oscar. It was way better than the sequel. In My opinion. If you haven't seen it go see it...now. It was great,10,0,1,15 January 2006
Snatch," Another point for Britain
","This movie had one flaw...Diction. The britsh was so cockney I couldn't understand a word they were saying. But other than that it was badass. It worked so perfectly. The story, the way it was filmed was totally flawless. It was boss. Jason Statham was very good in this movie. I was quite enjoying the depth in characters. Thats what I love in movies. I can't believe they put Brad Pitt in this. All together this was a brilliant. I love Guy Richie movies. Perfect Cast. Perfect Story. Perfectly Filmed. See it and be amazed. ********************************* out of *************************************.",10,7,11,29 January 2006
The Village," This Review Ticks me off
","This movie is brilliant. The reason people don't like it. It's too intricate. Aw, poor baby. Poor American citizen didn't get there answers. Okay people its inconclusive ending is why its a freakin' mystery. Not only that. But, its totally irrelevant to the plot. People miss the f------ point to this movie. It's supposed to make you wonder. Why wouldn't it make you feel stupid being ticked off because the movie got you involved for once. Whats the fun of seeing a movie when you leave knowing everything. Thank God for M. Night Shyamalan. Doing what Quentin Tarantino and the Coen bros. have already done. Made a movie that was different. For some reason not seeing the same old s--- ticked Americans off. Why because the film maker is creative. Altogether this was a brilliant move. Very intricate plot. Brilliant ending and a movie with a meaning. 10 out of 10.",10,6,11,29 June 2006
Saving Private Ryan," Brilliant but can't watch again.
","Okay, first things first. This movie is violent. Realistically violent. That is not good for a movie. There are violent films. Then there are violent films that are unpleasant to watch. Don't get me wrong. This is a great film. But, lets face facts, you can't watch this movie more than once. It got to the point where I stood up in tears yelling at the screen 'STOP IT, STOP IT!' Much glorified violence in the film which I hate. Steven Spielberg in my opinion is a very sick man. His films always feature innocent people being slaughtered in some realistic manner. Whether it be being eaten, being vaporized, or being inadvertedly blown up by a bomb. Also it messes with your head big time. You watch the death scenes and you watch the Americans getting slaughtered and your like 'Yeah get those sons of b%$*&*!' But then they capture the Nazi and he's only following orders. Then they kill him and you ask yourself 'Well, who's the bad guy here?' Adam Goldbergs death was chilling and incredibly painful to endure. At which point I realized. He just wanted to make a violent film. After witnessing that over the top, violent, and completely unnecessary death I wondered why I was watching it.This film emphasizes the horrors of war though. This film is useful. It is a wake up call to all those conservatives who are trying to shove American customs down Iraqs throat. Our soldiers have been suffering this horrific ordeal for years and why? WWII was for a better cause. This film is a one time thing. It is a wake up call mostly. but, other than that it was graphic, realistic, and over all very painful to watch. Unless your the violent creep who gets off with violent movies. In that case go crazy.",9,2,3,9 November 2006
The Evil Dead," Best Horror Flick Ever
","This movie was perfect. Aboslutely perfect. Sam Raimi is up there with my favorite directors Quentin Tarantino and Peter Jackson. This movie also scared the s--- out of me. Thats a hard thing to do to me. Sure it was gory as hell, But not enough to be offensive. Sam Raimi knows that you don't need boobies and language to make a movie good. I looked at the title thinking yep another freakin' zombie movie, then I saw it I realized it was way more than that. It wasn't typical zombie people getting eaten kind of not original movie. The movie was completely original. It wasn't even about zombies its about demons and possession. But still not a rip off of the Excorsist either. I loved it and you will to. But be cautious its rated NC-17 for substantial excessive graphic violence and gore.",10,0,1,17 January 2006
Pulp Fiction," Most Likely One of the Best Movie of all Time
",Okay This Movie is Boss. In My Opinion Quentin Tarantino is a Frickin' Genius. Of course there's the retarded stereotype that all Tarantino movies are just sex language and graphic brutal violence which just purely isn't true. His characters have depth and he has a brilliant story and Tarantino is probably *THE* best screenplay writer who has ever lived. Not a family movie. But a TRUE MOVIE MASTERPIECE!! I truly recommend this movie to anyone who likes difficult story lines to figure out. Also people who love a Brilliant screenplay. And if your choose to ignore the story line it alternates as kind of a gore flick. Sheer Brilliance This Is at the top list of my most definite all time favorite movies of all time. Tarantino I worship you at your feet for bringing such a work of art to the world.,10,0,2,11 January 2006
There Will Be Blood," The Highest Choir of angels wrote this I believe.
","I simply cannot express how much I adore this movie, there is just no way. When I first saw this movie in theaters, I left proud that I had just been able to witness the greatest movie ever made when it was in theaters. This is a movie about an impatient, greedy prospector who wants everything and that's that. He is told of a town where the oil seeps from the ground, and he goes there and buys it all. He deals with people who are just as greedy as him, but they don't show it. They want what he has and it drives him mad.Daniel Day Lewis has done it, he has simply laid forth the number one greatest movie performance of all time. With P.T. Anderson as his writer, this movie will be remembered as long as people can remember movies. When I say see this movie, I say it not because you want to see it, I say it because you need to see it. It is absolutely groundbreaking, I'd say it's a flawless work of art. ******* out of *******",10,1,10,15 February 2008
The Silence of the Lambs," Brilliant and Sweetly Freaky
",I will never forget the lines 'I ate his liver with fava beans and a nice chianti' that devilishly grotesque slurping haunted me. Anthony Hopkins was absolutely one of my favorite 'antagonists' of all time even if he only had 16 minutes of screen time. Never a wider use of psychopaths in one film to freak me out. This movie proves that indeed keep your friends close keep your enemies even closer. Just the fact of looking at this typically normal looking man and knowing he eats people made me believe that my granpa could just as well eat me. This movie truly scared me. I would recommend this to absolutely any one. I give it ***** out of*****.,10,0,2,23 March 2006
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," A Flawless work of Art
","OK Words cannot explain the sheer greatness of this movie. It is no questions asked the Best Movie Ever Made. This movie is a Masterpiece. I don't care what you think this movie made me cry several times. With Brilliant casting every Freaking emotion in this movie was so Believable that I worship it. IT...IS...Flawless. Absolutely Flawless. Brilliant battle sequences while at the same time staying so completely true to the book. I worship Peter Jackson and J.RR Tolkien. It would appeal to the most diverse audience in the world. This is the Ultimate movie. I know a person who was in this movie very personally. Literally the most thunderous movie ever. Like I said earlier words cannot explain the sheer greatness of this movie. More than a movie but a brilliant, Flawless Work of art...a FREAKIN' WORK OF ART.",10,1,2,11 January 2006
Fantastic Four," Almost as Bad than Boondock Saints
","How in the world could you people think that this poor excuse of cinema is anywhere near an efficient movie. This was the worst movie ever. It was Corny and boring. Dr. doom wasn't as menacing as in the comics. They should just stop with any more new comic book movie. They should keep going with X-men and Spiderman cause they are good movies. But on the positive one of the bands who played in this movie,Omnisoul, I am great friends with the singer. But I felt bad he had signed to be in this disgrace of a film. The CGI wasn't even good in this movie. This kind of movie makes me pity the actors and actress's who were forced to be in this Putrid Stinker of a Movie. Don't see it it was terrible...TERRIBLE!!!!",1,1,3,19 January 2006
Click," Brilliant and Heartbreaking
","This movie was very, very good. It shows the value of family and that you can't waste a moment of life on things that don't matter. This is also the first Adam Sandler tearjerker. Adam Sandler plays a workaholic father who needed a break from his stressful complicated life. So after a complicated episode at his home he goes to the Beyond section of Bed, Bath and, Beyond store. He finds a eccentric, but friendly inventor Morty (Walken)who gives him a very suspicious 'universal' remote that controls his universe. It's very fun and handy. Until it adapts to his preferences that catapult him from an overweight divorcÃ©e, to a senile old business man. After finding out Morty is the angel of death. He become terribley depressed. He eventually dies. But, then wakes up to find it was a gifted vision from Morty to help him. Tragic tearjerker. But at the same time hilarious. 10 out of 10",10,2,9,3 July 2006
Sin City," I Falter and Bow Before this Movies Majesty
","Absolutely Flawless Dude. Bad Ass Movie. I mean it is so good. A Robert Rodriguez Great. Just the way I like it, Unique, Brilliant, and Gory as Hell. Great screenplay and just brilliant characters. SO much depth to the characters. But I have to say it had the most Brutal and Graphic violence in it. Almost like there were no boundaries. The weird part is they had to take stuff out of the original graphic novel to stay away from a NC-17 rating. How can the comics get worse. But still a Masterpiece. It was filmed as if a movie comic book. But when Bruce Willis ripped that guys balls off That was enough to make me cringe which is hard for me. But I'd recommend this to anyone but children under the age of 14.",10,1,4,11 January 2006
V for Vendetta," Very Very Valuable
","First of all. Oh...My...God. This movie was amazing. You do not come by movies like this anymore. This is more than a film. It is a statement about corrupt governments and how important freedom is and the importance of an idea. Second of all. Loved the language. So poetic and beautiful. It is almost like watching a Shakespearian masterpiece. The Wachowski Bros. are very good story writers, and yet. It wasn't so deep that I couldn't understand what they were saying. The dialogue flowed so smoothly and smartly and lastly. The acting was outstanding. It was cast so well and every actor fit their part like salt and pepper. Hugo Weavings best performance. In conclusion, this movie was all expected and more. ***** out of *****. Absolutely brilliant and valuable information.",10,0,2,14 August 2006
