The Incredible Hulk," Marvel's now 2 for 2!
","This one's pretty easy...if you've been wanting a Hulk movie, this is it! It's a fast-paced, character-driven, action-filled roller coaster that really delivers. This film is faster & less angst-ridden than the Ang Lee production a while back, but doesn't throw unthinking or purposeless mayhem at you either. Like Lee's, Leterrier's offering arrives owing more to the TV series than the actual comic origins (so no Rick Jones or gamma bombs), but does hew a bit closer to the Marvel Universe. Insiders will see lots of set-up for future outings in details like SHIELD, Drs. Samson & Sterns, and the long-abandoned Super Soldier Project. Like Downey last month, Norton pretty much carries the movie with a very engaging and nuanced performance. He plays the guilt-ridden conflicted hero well, and is supported ably by fine turns by Tyler, Hurt, and Roth. My main complaint: a sudden, inexplicably truncated ending that left too much up in the air, with only the slightest of epilogues. Actually, TWO epilogues. They give nice teases for what lies ahead, but did little in service to the story just seen. As said by many, it's not Iron Man level, but Incredible Hulk makes a dang fine 2nd Marvel-only movie and makes one quite optimistic about their future slate.",10,4,7,15 June 2008
