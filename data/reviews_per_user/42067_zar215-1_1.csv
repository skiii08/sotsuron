Spartacus," Spartacus is an epic tale of a slave and his army of fellow slaves. The film follows Spartacus in his conquest on the Roman Empire.
","Spartacus is an excellent movie.  It is one of my favorites and a must see. I give it 5 STARS.  I am a big fan of the director Stanely Kubrick.  He's done a lot of brilliant films in the past but, Spartacus shows a special something.  I think that Spartacus is way ahead of its time.  When I first saw the film and looked at when it was made, I thaught it should have said 1980 something.  Overall I beleive that Spartacus is must see.",9,0,1,19 September 2003
