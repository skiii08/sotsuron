Angels & Demons," A fun, easy to enjoy study of science v. religion.
","I didn't read the book Angels and Demons, but I had loved the Da Vinci Code, and I had enjoyed that movie, despite it's flaws. When I saw this film I was a bit more skeptical, but I was rewarded with a fun and fast paced thriller.The plot is, well, present, but not really important. This movie is much more about the structural hierarchy of the Catholic Church and the evolving relationship between science and religion than about any conspiracy, as was the case with the first film. The Illuminati are more of a distraction than anything else.If you are a nerd like me, then you will love the shots of the Large Hadron Collider; also every scene set inside the Vatican does a good job of portraying the inner workings of the Papacy without presenting it in an overly negative or conspiratorial light.About the only thing that surprised me was the level of violence present in this PG-13 movie. Two years ago the MPAA would have given it an R rating. This didn't bother me at all, but if you are at all squeamish or thinking of taking younger children, keep this in mind.All in all, this isn't the greatest film in the world, but it is one of those movies that really is better seen on the big screen.Michael",7,1,4,1 June 2009
Star Trek," It's All About The Characters
","This movie surprised me. I didn't think I would like it. But I did. I saw it a second time and, then I understood what they were doing. They were trying to draw in an audience that had been hostile to Star Trek, by making it more like Star Wars. Silly but fun. Stupid characters, with stupid lines, an implausible plot, and flashy special effects. And it worked beautifully.This film restarts Star Trek. It is intended to draw you in. Once you get the point, you start to understand the idea behind Star Trek. You trust the characters portrayed on the screen. The movie tells you who to like, and who to dislike. Ultimately, you end up understanding everybody.The relationship between Kirk and Spock is the heart and soul of the film. Both actors to a terrific job here, with Kirk's impulsiveness tempered by Spock's forced rationalism. Chris Pine is far more effective than Shatner ever was as an extremely bright and charismatically reckless commander. Zachary Quinto owns the young Spock, although his encounter with Leonard Nemoy's Spock sets up the possibility that we may see a different character emerge as this new series progresses. The other characters work well; funny, likable, but never overshadowing the primary focus of Kirk/Spock. The thing that impressed me most was the CGI and the sound; this movie is watchable purely for those two elements alone. This is easily the most impressive spectacle I have ever seen in theaters. I would not advise you miss seeing this film in theaters for any reason. Michael",8,1,8,31 May 2009
X-Men Origins: Wolverine," X-Men needs a reboot.
","I hated this movie. I tried very hard to like it. But I reached a point about 40 minutes into it that I simply did not care to watch the rest. I did, and regretted it.Wolverine, as portrayed in this film, is one of the least compelling characters in the comic book universe. You find yourself not caring what happens to him by the end; this is troublesome for a movie that was trying to give you a back story to a very interesting character first introduced in the original X-Men movie.Worst, he is overshadowed by some very interesting characters, most notably Gambit. They could have called this X-Men Origins: Gambit and left most of it intact, even though Gambit himself is on screen for a very short period.I could keep going on; dialog is poor, camera-work is shoddy, the special effects are particularly bad for a high budget film, there are too many characters, and there really is no point to watching what happens to Wolverine.Skip it. Catch it on FX, but only if there's nothing else on.Michael",3,4,9,1 June 2009
Terminator Salvation," A film I desperately wanted but didn't expect to be good and rewarded my skepticism!
","Terminator Salvation has little in common with the other three films, of which T2 remains one of my all time favorites, T1 is still very watchable (the fight in the police station is just terrific), and T3 was exactly what I expected; not very good or relevant. When I heard that McG was directing, the guys who wrote T3 were writing this one, and that they had to beg Christian Bale to join the cast, I decided not to see it. Everything I heard just reinforced my decision, and Bale's tantrum didn't help things. Finally I read all the reviews that were written about it, and made my decision to take a gamble. I'd give McG a chance. I figured that Roger Ebert was probably right in calling it 'All action, all the time.' I agree with 95% of Ebert's reviews. And you know what? Every single negative review of this movie is wrong.This is the best Terminator film ever made. It combined what worked so well with the other films, and added the missing piece to the story. The other three films had all established that man was destined to create Skynet, but that we had the ability to stop this. It was our inability to recognize the implications of our actions that pushed us closer to Judgment Day.But the original three failed to establish that it was in fact Human Nature to do the right thing. That we were all in fact good, and we were merely reacting in fear to something that we did not understand.This film corrects that mistake. It very effectively hammers home the point that the machines cannot possibly stop Humanity; they can kill, maim, destroy, threaten, seduce, manipulate, self-destruct; they will still fail. The more desperate they got, the more they strengthened the resistance's position.They had tried to kill John Conner by killing his mother, and in effect helped her prepare him for the war; they tried to kill him when he was young, and demonstrated that their weapons could be used against them; they tried killing him and his wife, and proved the futility of trying to predict the future; in this film, they try to corrupt Human Nature to work against itself, and they only demonstrate that Human Nature is incorruptible.This film, from start to finish, works. The music was criticized for being lame, but you see that they had kept it to a minimum to preserve the atmosphere of the conflict; it was criticized for being dark and bleak, but if it had not you would have been merely watching an action flick, instead of a story of survival; it was criticized for having too much action, but if it didn't, then there would have been no menace.Instead of blaring music, McG relies on ambient sounds and faint musical cues to help set the mood. Instead of setting it in a familiar past, he sets it in an ugly future; this helps keeps you focused on what every scene is about. Instead of favoring exposition over dialogue, he throws machines at you at every plausible opportunity; he refuses to let you get comfortable by putting these people you care about in one perilous situation after another.What was it that made me realize that McG knew what he was doing? Watch the first helicopter scene. John's refusal to obey orders saves his life, his attempt to save the people aboard the prison ship saves his life, and then he is attacked by a Terminator torso. The Terminator, rather than doing the cold, logical thing, and grab him somewhere on his body, preferably his throat, and squeeze until he dies, instead throws him away. Why? Because Skynet doesn't want to kill John Conner any more. It thinks that by toying with him, he will keep moving closer to what he wants to do. Which is to destroy Skynet. Skynet figured this out, and they sent him the key. Marcus Wright.Marcus is the whole point of the story. He isn't a hero or a villain; he is a metaphor for Human Nature. No matter what happens to him in this film, he ultimately makes the right decision, and in doing so, redeems himself in his own eyes.If you want to truly appreciate this film then follow these directions. Do exactly what I did, and you will come to the same realization that I had. Read 10-20 reviews, and then Roger Ebert's. Go see the movie.If I am right, then cool. If I am wrong, please, tell me by commenting on what I am writing here.Michael",8,6,13,31 May 2009
Alien," Terrifying, captivating, and thrilling; this film is something special.
","I love this movie! It scared the living hell out of me when I was seven. I couldn't even read a horror-picture book at the library describing the movie without experiencing the gnawing sensation of fear creeping into my gut. This is one of the first films to come out firing on all cylinders, and man, it sure does hit it out of the park! For one thing, take the title, Alien, and apply it to any aspect of the film, including Ash and the titular antagonist. The cargo ship is a freaking nightmare of steampunk imagination and industrial irreverence gone wild. It's no wonder the crew sleeps through most of the voyage. Would you want to be awake and living in that thing? The music is also sinisterly effective; its sole purpose is to manipulate you into either a false sense of security or to accentuate the already obvious menace of the scene; otherwise, it isn't even there.Ridley Scott and crew did an excellent job in recognizing that trying to portray computers in the future from a 1978 perspective was futile; rather, they kept it simple, included some flashing lights (because as we all see now, flashing lights are the future), and kept it cold, precise, and doing exactly as it was told.As was Ash. His every action makes sense once his true purpose is revealed. And his words, describing the Alien as perfect, echoed by Bishop in the second film, are particularly significant; computers and insects have very little in common except for one thing; they do exactly what their environment implores them to do. It is no surprise that the only emotion the computer expresses is awe when it encounters an equally simple and effective entity.The characters are not given the time to explain their motives or describe their characters; yet, their responses to their increasingly degrading situation flesh them out in a way that hours of dialog could not have possibly achieved, Ripley chief among them. Easily the least likable person at the moment of the the alien's entry onto the ship; she ends up becoming your only hope of rescue from this horrible situation; and her responses to each situation turn out to be the correct one; if her crew had listened to her from the beginning, they would all be alive.The alien itself is also terrifying. Equally anthropomorphic and insectoid; easy to understand yet unstoppable in action; its motives are clear but its next move cannot be predicted; it is as Ash put it, a perfect organism.This is one hell of a ride from beginning to end. It still scares me, and to this day remains my one and only benchmark in the genre of horror.",10,1,3,5 June 2009
Transformers," The greatest movie ever made. Ever.
","I have never sat silent in a theater as the credits rolled on a movie I had just enjoyed. I usually clap, or laugh, or talk excitedly to my friends about it. With this one, I needed a minute to savor the emotions I was feeling. I had, for the first time in my life, felt true love for something other than a woman.This is a truly great film. Compared to this movie, No Country For Old Men, another film I like, is garbage.The visual effects are spectacular even if you don't understand the complexity of either getting the right shot or creating the CGI necessary to make it look real. Any and all flaws about lighting or the transition of sunlight are pathetic compared to the visual masterpiece they ultimately created. These robots look real! The fights look real. The characters react to them as if they were real.People criticize the stupidity of the film. Yes, it is stupid. So? The film flows well; every scene not only works, but helps to explain the situation a bit more, helps to reveal a bit more about the characters,and helps to move the story along. So what if we don't find out about the global reaction to alien robots fighting a war on our planet; you're already complaining about how long the movie is! I did not grow up on the original Transformers; I had to settle for the toys and the Beast Wars show; but I still loved the mythology. This film captures it perfectly, accentuating the most important themes without complicating things with unnecessary dialog and explanations (ahem, Episode I...).My favorite element? The score! No film's music has ever captured my attention like this one. I still hum the damn tune as I walk my dog each night. The producers realized that they had struck gold; watch the trailers for the second movie; the music and sounds are mostly the same.This is a great film! Great on television, yes, but it will never be the same if you do not watch it in theaters. I saw it three times there, and I will do at least as much when Revenge of the Fallen comes out.See this movie! Michael",10,2,3,2 June 2009
