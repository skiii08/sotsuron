Iron Man 3," Possibly one of the worst movies of all time.
","Just borrowed Iron Man 3 from my local library for free to watch while I'm stuck at home all day. In those circumstances most films will be watchable. Iron Man 3 was terrible. There is literally no segment of the entire film that makes sense. I hope most people will stop drinking the marvel kool aid. Their CGI is getting worse every film, and they do not care about story or plot. There is nothing keeping these movies watchable at all.",1,1,5,10 August 2017
