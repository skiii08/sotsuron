Blade Runner 2049," Another soulless Denis Villeneuve movie 2 out of 10
","Why this film has so much critical praise is beyond me, visually it does have some merit but in no way is this close to the brilliance of the original. The plot moves at a snails pace and as with other Denis Villeneuve movies lacks a soul, characters you actually care about and a plot twist that is nowhere near as clever as it thinks it is (yes I'm talking about the other turd fest that was Arrival) The one and only SPOILER I'm going to discuss in this review if you can call it that is?'The Ryan Gosling sex scene'and I won't reveal much. Basically if you've seen the far superior Patrick Swayze classic Ghost your getting the whoopi Goldberg/ Demi Moore love scene rehashed for a futuristic world and yes it comes across as pathetic as in sounds. Never in my wildest dreams did I think I'd be comparing Blade Runner 2049 to Ghost or even one I haven't mentioned 'watching paint dry'. Especially on the back of such outlandish reviews as best sequel ever. In terms of sequels I class this as an Alien 3 of sequels, we had the original Blade Runner and Alien films both sci-fi classics but I expected Blade Runner 2049 to be the Aliens of sequels instead of the Alien 3 of sequels a bit rubbish if your honest but there's always some weirdos who'll like it.Even the the sight of a skyscraper sized topless Ana de Armas hologram failed to arouse any emotion within me after being bored to a near death state by the first 2hrs let alone the remaining 44 minutes.",1,78,163,8 October 2017
The Amazing Spider-Man," The amazing spiderman is 'AMAZING'
","Firstly I found the last 3 spiderman movies boring and fully expected this one to be much of the same. How wrong could I have been the cast do a great job of bringing the characters to life, I see so many films where I just don't care about the main characters and in some case if they all died it would make the film a hell of a lot more interesting. But here you become really involved in there lives and I think this is because of the humour which is great and just adds to the likability of each character. The effects are awesome and even the lizard looks good which I wasn't expecting. Normally CGI characters look average at best (I don't like CGI at all) like the hulk in the various adaptations but here it works. From the trailer I thought some of the 1st person shots of spiderman swinging through the streets were gimmicky but again I was wrong Marc Webb does an excellent job and picks some amazing shots to showcase spiderman in action. I personally enjoyed this more than the avengers and for the first time ever i'am looking forward to a spiderman sequel. I'm sold on this reboot and all involved and I'd say if your a fan you'll love it and if your not you will be its a fun cinema experience and well worth the price of admission, it really is amazing!!!",9,40,100,19 June 2012
