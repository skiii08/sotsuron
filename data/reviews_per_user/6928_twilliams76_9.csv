Sucker Punch," The audience is the recipient of the Sucker Punch.
","Following on the heels of his over-hyped, super-stylish and widely-embraced 300 and Watchmen, director Zack Snyder takes on the classic theme of misogyny in the swords-and-corsets, avenging-angel fantasy, Sucker Punch.300 basically gave its viewers scantily-clad Spartan warriors fighting to survive (in order to fight another day). Watchmen did the same thing ... although its characters were superhero-clad warriors fighting to survive (in order to fight another day). Sucker Punch features a group of young women who dress like dancers that ... (guess what they fight to do?!).The story is that of Baby Doll's (Emily Browning - Sleeping Beauty, A Series of Unfortunate Events) as she escapes the clutches of an abusive step-father only to be deposited into a mental institution for wayward girls who is scheduled to be lobotomized within one week's time. In order to cope and survive her harsh new reality, Baby Doll imagines a world of dancing and lurid, kick-ass action sequences (we get everything from dragons to samurai warriors to WWII Nazis in some highly choreographed film montages).Oscar Isaac (Robin Hood, Agora, Body of Lies) plays the corrupt captor of Baby Doll and her fellow inmates Rocket (Jena Malone - Pride & Prejudice, Life as a House), Rocket's older sister Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish - Bright Star, Limitless), Amber (Jamie Chung - The Hangover Part II, Grown-Ups) and Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens - High School Musical, Beastly). A lot could be read-into Sucker Punch with its themes and its objectification of women and I'd venture to say some of it (most, actually) would be correct; but the action sequences at the very core of the movie (while choreographed nicely) prevent the film from being much more than male-fantasy.While 300 had Snyder's biggest box office and was his biggest success, it had the least amount of story ... and it has been interesting to see what his fans and (shrinking) audiences have fawned over. Dawn of the Dead, 300, Watchmen and Sucker Punch were all dramatically different and have shown a large-variety of directing choices/methods. To be fair, Sucker Punch had a lot of potential but most of it was squandered and turned into an uncertain film. The trust given to him to direct/helm the upcoming Man of Steel (another retelling of Superman) is HUGE. With another 'disaster' like Sucker Punch (referring to BO only as my eyes have seen much worse), Snyder and his career may be sucker-punched as well ... and it could be GAME OVER before his career ever had much of a chance. His artistic vision (which I admit is grand) might be extinguished if he cannot seamlessly blend/meld storytelling with his renowned artistry.",4,1,5,13 July 2011
Source Code," Duncan Jones does it again!
","Duncan Jones (Moon) gives us yet another short-and-sweet sci-fi treat with Source Code. I didn't like it as much as I loved Moon; but this is still a very respectable watch as some sci-fi is too outlandish and over-the-top for everyday people (non sci-fi fans) to enjoy -- this one has a story that I think should appeal to anybody (it simply is grounded in sci-fi).As the film plays out (quickly), we discover that Jake Gyllenhaal (Donnie Darko, Brokeback Mountain, Jarhead) is being sent into a parallel reality to find the source of a bomb on a commuter train headed into the metropolitan area of Chicago. Seated across from him is a pretty passenger who knows him (although he doesn't know her) played by Michelle Monaghan (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, North Country, Somewhere). With only 8 minutes at a time to move about and discover something new about his environment, our hero only has limited options.As the urgency presses, his supervisor who appears to him via video screen, Vera Farmiga (Up in the Air, Orphan, The Departed) reveals to him why he has been chosen for this task and why it needs to be solved. Her supervisor, in turn, Jeffrey Wright (Shaft, Casino Royale, The Invasion) wants her to keep mum on all info she offers him and the secret soon comes into focus.The film plays out at a taut pace and it keeps one's interest rather easily. Gylleenaal and Monaghan are two of my favorite in the upcoming-next-generation of Hollywood so they help make the film play-out even when we are questioning what it is exactly we are seeing. While this one does NOT have a Moon-esque twist at the film's end, it is gripping nonetheless.I'd recommend Source Code to anybody who likes suspenseful drama ... and leave out its sci-fi element entirely as it isn't what makes that film. THAT is Gyllenhaal and Monaghan.",7,0,1,13 July 2011
Bridesmaids," Girls Just Want to Have Fun (too) -- and it gets even better with repeat viewings!!!
","How one feels about the raunchy female kink-fest Bridesmaids also hinges on how much one likes (and/or can tolerate) the old Wilson-Phillips standby, 'Hold On' (for real). The song is an admitted guilty-pleasure to many (including myself); but Bridesmaids shouldn't be quite the guilty pleasure as that song as there should be NO guilt in liking this female driven Judd Apatow-production (thanks to him we have Superbad, Knocked-Up, The 40 Year Old Virgin, Anchorman, Step Brothers etc in our video libraries!!). It is a rare female-driven bawdy comedy along the lines of The Hangover (but NOT as graphic or extreme) that is smart, crafty and emotionally-driven with a mature-comedic performance by its star, Kristen Wiig (SNL, Knocked Up, Whip It). Wiig's Annie finds her life spiraling downward after her best friend Lillian (Maya Rudolph - SNL, Idiocracy, Away We Go) becomes engaged and her life appears to be approaching 'perfection'. I MUST say and stress that Wiig is a marvel here and her bridal shower meltdown is one for the record books (cookie, anyone?!). Wiig may have been around for years; but this performance solidified her as a comedy star.With a 'new' best friend (Rose Byrne - Sunshine, 28 Weeks Later, Insidious, 'Damages') who steamrolls into Lillian's life, Annie feels abandoned and alone when all of her thoughts and concerns should be focused on the upcoming nuptials of her best friend. The drama that plays out behind the film's comedy is surprisingly sophisticated and grown-up and very realistic. Add to this comedy-drama some fine-supporting players as in the UNCREDITED sleazy/sexist Jon Hamm ('Mad Men', The Town, The Day the Earth Stood Still); a still radiant but SADLY late Jill Clayburgh (Love and Other Drugs, An Unmarried Woman, Running with Scissors) in her last role; and a perky Ellie Kemper (Somewhere, 'The Office', Get Him to the Greek) and Bridesmaids has a little bit of everything for everyone (although fellow supporting player Melissa McCarthy of TV's 'Mike & Molly' takes it a bit too far).Even if the film is all-about Annie and her fellow bridesmaids ... I think the story of ANYone being 'left behind' as a friend moves onto the next stages of his/her life is a universal one. Wiig's performance captures the fragility of a scared individual who's life has not turned out according to plan ... but as the story (and song) can attest -- if one can 'hold on for one more day ...' things may change.Life does come at us one day at a time ... it is too bad that films like this come around much less often. I must say that I highly enjoyed Bridesmaids after seeing it ONE time; but my opinion has only gotten stronger and improved with each subsequent viewing! I think this movie is something rather special.",8,1,3,13 July 2011
Drive," They don't get much better than this
","The Best Picture race has begun ... although I fear this one won't survive the Academy's final cut (I'd venture to say it's 'too cool' for The Academy). Drive is a wonder to behold and watch.Drive is a film about a driver who is a film stunt man and a random getaway driver for various people who needs his services for a short yet solid five minutes of work -- the film's opening cat-and-mouse scene sets the tone for what's to come. The Driver is played by Ryan Gosling (The Notebook, Half Nelson, Crazy Stupid Love) and he is a man of few words. He appears to drive simply to have a purpose.Driver soon meets a young mother, Irene(Carey Mulligan - Pride & Prejudice, An Education, Wall Street 2), who lives in his apartment building ... and the two become quasi-friends as they both tend to be guarded and rather quiet although their facial expressions and body language tell us everything we need to know about them. Driver quickly befriends her young son ... but their friendship becomes strained upon the arrival of his father/her husband, Standard, (Oscar Isaac - Robin Hood, Sucker Punch) ... a recovering criminal with ties to some total losers who don't want to allow him to exit/leave their line of work so that he can honestly provide for his family.Believing that he has the ability to help Standard obtain a life of respectability, Driver sets out to help him on one final heist ... only things don't go as planned ... for anybody. Albert Brooks (Broadcast News, Mother) and Ron Perlman (City of Lost Children, Hellboy) play some fellow wannabe-thugs and Mad Men's Christina Hendricks shows up briefly as Blanche, a fellow co-hort in crime.With a pulsating soundtrack (featuring some awesome songs!), the film comes alive and becomes ripe with feeling as Driver (himself) experiences a rebirth of feelings that had long been dormant. At times gentle and at time brutally violent ... Drive is an artistic triumph as it is a mesmerizing watch. Layered with metaphor (note Driver's jacket), superior lighting and sound editing, and an ingenious use of character names (Standard, Blanche, Irene means 'peace' etc.), Drive is one of those RARE films that make you glad to be alive in this time of cinema.Drive is one of the few films I have seen in recent years that remind you of life ... and what it means to feel and have a sense of worth and belonging. It does seem to be a film of few words ... but extra words were not necessary ... as Drive is alive. And thank God I am too.",10,5,10,28 September 2011
Unknown," Generic thriller that is still better than most.
","Even with some relatively decent car chase/street scenes and an intriguing premise of one 'losing his mind', Unknown felt generic to me.Liam Neeson (Taken, Schindler's List, Chloe) is in Berlin for a conference with his wife January Jones (X-Men: First Class, 'Mad Men', Bandits). As she is checking into their hotel, he realizes a bag was left at the airport and he returns to get it ... only to be in an automobile accident which leaves him comatose for four days. When he awakens, he is not who he believed/remembers himself to be.Stranded in a foreign city with only his cab driver (Diane Kruger - Troy, Inglourious Basterds, National Treasure) 'remembering him', he sets out to discover why his past is so secretive and how come he vividly remembers ONLY portions of it. As his wife no longer knows who he is, her husband (now played by Aidan Quinn -- Michael Collins, Jonah Hex, Legends of the Fall) has his name but isn't HIM! Neeson finds himself working against all odds to figure out the mystery behind himself.While there is nothing technically wrong with Unknown, there just isn't anything spectacular about it either. The plot grows and builds and bit-by-bit our 'hero' puts all of the pieces back together again (think Memento ... only not in reverse and not as good). That the cast was so nice to look at and the film had such a frenzied pace in a foreign locale, Unknown reminded me of the 1988 Harrison Ford flick, Frantic.Without giving too much of it away, it is easy to say that Unknown is as generic as it's name. All pieced together it comes out as a new film; but taken apart piece-by-piece one can see what Unknown shares with every other known suspense/thriller of mistaken identity Hollywood has ever given us. It is fine (and better than many) ... just don't expect anything shockingly new or original with Unknown.",5,1,3,14 July 2011
Jack Reacher," Tom Cruise's BEST in at least a decade
","Those who know me well know that I am not the biggest fan of Tom Cruise and I can actually do without most of his movies. It seems as if Tom Cruise has at one time signed up somewhere to play a character that has been used interchangeably ever since in a variety of movies as he is oftentimes a tough-talking alpha-male with a chip-on-his-shoulder.Jack Reacher is a perfect Cruise character as he is the SMOOTHEST toughest-talking, most alpha-male movie character to be on screen in months (he is also the film's title character and that could possibly be all that Cruise needed as motivation). Jack Reacher doesn't really have a chip on his shoulder, though ... his 'chip' is more like a state the size of Texas.Reacher is called to Pittsburgh to help investigate a multiple murder in which five random people were killed from a hail of six shots along the urban riverfront. A military officer is accused of the murders but Reacher knows the suspect is just a patsy which means he'll have to dig a little deeper to get to the truth and find what has been hidden and/or destroyed.Not getting much help from the law (who actually believe Jack could be behind the deaths or at least knows something else about them), Jack teams up with the officer's lawyer, Helen (Rosamund Pike - Pride & Prejudice), and the pair follow evidence trails that lead to her father's corrupt office at the DA (Richard Jenkins - Killing Them Softly) and to other less-than-desirable individuals such as a sociopathic hit-man (Jai Courtney - A Good Day to Die Hard) and a secretive Russian mob boss (Warner Herzog - What Dreams May Come).Jack always has something to say no matter the situation or surroundings (this kind of won me over) and he must always stay a step of others and his surroundings as his life and Helen's life are quickly put into danger. Figuring out why these five people were killed and what their unlikely link was might get Jack into trouble or killed ... Can Jack figure it all out before it is too late?! Jack Reacher has some good dialogue and it was my favorite thing about the film. Cruise oftentimes comes across as arrogant but here his character's talk backed-up his stance. Pike has little to actually do but I still like her as an actress and using Herzog in such a small role garners attention as he rarely acts on screen anymore. Jack Reacher plays its hand wisely and most of it works.Director Christopher McQuarrie (The Usual Suspects) has wisely crafted a film that makes one wonder and suspect and anticipate what'll come next. As much as I hate to admit to liking a Cruise vehicle ... I did like Jack Reacher and I could actually watch it again!",6,1,3,7 September 2013
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," Thanks for the decade of MAGIC, Harry!
","Saving the BEST for last ... the final film of the Harry Potter saga (8 films over a ten year span!!!) is rather monumental in what it achieves.By far the most grown-up and mature of the films (which, after the last couple, IS saying something), HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has a high death toll (readers of the books won't be shocked by this) and the entire film is a fitting farewell to one of the world's most favorite literary and cinematic heroes of ALL time. *sniff sniff* Who'd have thought the tale(s) of the bespectacled boy wizard, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), and his two best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) -- first-conceived on a pub napkin! -- would have made for such gripping celluloid? The Deathly Hallows Part 2 has EVERYTHING wanted in a good film (action, drama, romance, suspense, good dialogue, chemistry, great characters, some hearty laughs and some stifled tears). This film -- as directed by David Yates (he has directed the final 4 Potter films) -- is a tribute to such a fine character (and ALL of the supporting players LARGE and small), a tribute to Ms. Rowling, and a tribute to the millions (billions?) of loyal Harry Potter fans the world over.In addition to our dependable trio, Deathly Hallows Part 2 gives ample (enough) screen time to several Potter supporting players. Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) FINALLY gets to shine/step-up like his three classmates; Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) gets a Yoda-Moment (awesome-ness!!!); Mrs. Weasley (Julie Walters) gets to deliver the book/film's BEST line of dialogue; the batty Bellatrix LeStrange (Helena Bonham Carter) vamps evil craziness as her master, Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), seethes hate. Ever-so-brief glimpses of Hogwarts classmates and professors (like Emma Thompson's Sybil Trelawney) is also pleasing to loyal fans of the previous films. The most notable new addition to the cast is Kelly MacDonald who -- as Helena Ravenclaw -- gives House Ravenclaw their most-important role in the entire film franchise (just-in-time, I'd say).It may sound dumb; but this final film is EPIC on several levels ... and that 'epic-ness' is different for every viewer -- and that is one of the reasons Potter is so special (his/the film's 'connection' is different for every fan). This franchise is no fantasy fluff ... it has graduated (with honors!) to classic cinema that will endure for all time.Seeing this cast grow-up in front of us has been both a marvel and a treat (with nary a Lohan-moment amongst them!!!); and it also makes many of the faceless deaths in the film more resounding as we realize most of them were mere children who's bravery and heroics cost them their lives as they stood-up for GOODNESS in a world wrought with evil (damn you, Voldemort!).There are moments in this film that make the audience feel proud of the heroics on screen and ALL of it makes us thankful. Thank you, Harry Potter ... thank you for forever. You've made magic happen.",9,1,3,20 July 2011
The Purge," Great idea ... not so great execution.
","Although The Purge has one of the more interesting plots/concepts for a movie that I have come across lately, the film never fully delivers on its promises of originality or (high) suspense and the movie left me feeling more disappointed and let-down than anything else.Disappointment is never a good feeling to have upon exiting a theater because it means the recently watched film has failed (somewhere, somehow). This is not saying The Purge does not have some good ideas because it does ... the film just does not live up to its adrenaline-pumping expectations following that creepy-spooky trailer that had people (like myself) muttering the three letters W, T and F with some stress on the F.The premise is actually a good one as it 'echoes' the (year) 2000 Japanese import, Battle Royale, and also the young-adult/box office sensation -- and best-selling book -- The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. Although the films (and their stories) are nothing alike, they share a central concept with one another: a future dystopian society subjugates and controls their populations by offering-up a (voluntary in some cases) means of violent, no-holds-barred, winner-takes-all crowd-control as a way of keeping order.In The Purge, Americans are graciously given 12 hours to kill, steal, abuse, pillage, maim or commit any number of carnal base sins he/she deems desirable with no questions asked (afterwards). This one night exists as a way of hopefully getting animalistic urges out of a person's system. It is because of the Purge that ALL other hours of the year are peacefully controlled and organized in order to maintain a high level of security and safety (there are no cops or other safety personnel on call during the 12-hour window). Just as there are 'no questions asked' in the movie, the audience isn't supposed to ask a whole lot either.Ethan Hawke (Before Sunrise, Gattaca) and Lena Headey ('Game of Thrones', 300) play a married couple with two teenage children who are facing the Purge head-on by locking down their house (he has made a fortune in the home $ecuritie$ industry) and settling in for a long evening hoping they live to see the sun rise on the other side of night ... only it is The Purge and people oftentimes will make plans for something he/she is unable to complete. When a helpless stranger is heard calling for help (after the clock has already begun), nobody knows who can be trusted.The Purge has a very smart and intriguing idea at its core (the writer-director deserves much credit for this), but the inexperienced direction by DeMonaco makes The Purge almost as messy and chaotic as an actual Purge would be. It is too bad because there is a lot of potential here. Perhaps don't expect as much as I did ... and there won't be as much disappointment (as I believe the film does not deserve to be disliked).",4,2,4,4 July 2013
Moon," A Cerebrally Beguiling Lunar Confection
","Moon is a fascinating, ingenious, and original sci-fi/fantasy film by first-time (full-length) director, Duncan Jones.It is another small, sly, well-made sci-fi flick like Primer; but it is more stylish and polished like the equally-brainy Gattaca.Sam Rockwell (Charlie's Angels, Matchstick Men, Iron Man 2) delivers a commanding performance as the lone astronaut-miner on the moon -- he is excellent here and was easily one of the better of 2009 (ahem, way to look the other way Academy!!). Kevin Spacey (American Beauty, Se7en, The Usual Suspects) is soothing as the voice of GERTY (Moon's HAL 9000).Moon is nearly perfect with what it sets out to achieve. Just like it's titular celestial object, Moon may be small but it isn't slight -- it is a cerebrally beguiling lunar confection.",8,5,11,1 July 2011
