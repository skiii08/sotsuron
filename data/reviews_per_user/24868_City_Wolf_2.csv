Requiem for a Dream," best movie of Darren Aronofsky
","What makes Requiem for a dream so great is the realistic perspective on different drug addictions and drug addicts. Aronofsky was the only director who could make this movie so dark and depressive. Throughout the story movie makes us connect with the characters so we feel exactly what they feel, which can be very traumatizing especially towards the end. The cast of this movie is great, not just because of their acting but they are easy to connect with. The writer of the story Hubert Selby Jr. struggled with depression his whole life so with the help of Aronofsky they wrote the screenplay the best way possible. One of the other great things that cannot go unnoticed is the composer Clint Mansell, whose soundtrack fits perfectly in every scene and makes the ending of this movie absolutely perfect.",10,1,2,7 September 2013
The Conjuring," one of the best horror movies ever made
","Its like everything you have already seen or wanted to see in a horror movie, only improved. I've seen it in a cinema and after seeing the rating, i was pretty sure it was overrated, but in the middle of the movie i couldn't wait to see it again. The best part of seeing it on a big screen with a lot of people around is that you wont really be scared much, but when something jumps out, you will probably jump out of your seat, or if you watch a lot of horror movies, like me, you will just laugh at other peoples reactions.I have never had so much fun watching people scream (which happened about three times during this movie), so i was just smiling the whole movie.This movie is easily considered one of the best horror movies of this century and i think it will stay a classic, because it has everything, that a horror movie needs, from creepy dolls to demons and exorcisms.",8,2,5,12 October 2013
