Marie Antoinette," Ugh! Then UGH!
","There is a historical crime being committed when someone decided that K.Dunst performs as Marie Antoinette, the queen who is/was well known for being one of the most beautiful women in the entire written history of human beings. At least they could have picked some other actress that doesn't look so miserably sorry, someone who can simply SMILE right?!!Now we have K.Dunst, plays Marie Antoinette.... Ugh!!",1,0,1,27 March 2020
