The Lobster," Not for everyone

Eventually Disney ruin everything....Mission accomplished. Let the merchandising begin.",2,73,131,26 December 2019
Bohemian Rhapsody," Fantastic Film
",Another prime example of just how out of touch and irrelevant critics opinions are today. This is an awesome film and Rami is incredible.,10,3,4,10 November 2018
