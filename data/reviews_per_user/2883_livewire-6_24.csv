Saturday Night Fever," Sunday morning hangover
","Last night, I saw 'Saturday Night Fever' on TV. It brought back memories of my own disco days in the mid- to late 1970s. Sad to say, the film perfectly captures the emptiness and superficiality of that era, and its negative impact on people's lives, then and since.Back then, it was all about how you looked and how you dressed, how you danced and whether you scored. Who knew that the slim, sleek, svelte Travolta would balloon like Elvis Presley - just as all of us were fated to age, lose our hair and expand our waists. The disco culture of the 70s was youth-oriented, but in a brain-dead way, unlike the politically aware late 1960s anti-war youth culture.'Saturday Night Fever' sends mixed messages. Its soundtrack of BeeGees hits is a siren song of longing and romance, yet the screenplay tells a different story. Tony Manero (John Travolta) rejects poor Annette (Donna Pescow) because she's short and dumpy and not good enough for him. Upwardly mobile Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) spurns him in turn, offering only the possibility of platonic friendship. Tony's friend Bobby gets his girlfriend pregnant, but is too young and immature to assume his responsibilities. And all Tony's other friends care about is humping virtual strangers for ten minutes in the back seat of a car.Saturday night fever gives them nothing but Sunday morning hangover - without any Sunday morning spirituality to fill the void in their lives. Religion gets short shrift in this film. Tony's brother Frank leaves the priesthood, not because he struggles with his faith, but because he can't live up to his vow of celibacy. Even he has sex on the brain.Sex was the be-all and end-all of disco culture - witness the soft-core shots of Travolta in nothing but low-rise briefs - and we have inherited its legacy. I say 'we' because I too am a child of the 70s. For the next 25 years, I lived according to the values I had learned on the dance floor. I worshipped at the shrine of youth and beauty and sex - and it left me as empty as the characters in the film. Like Tony Manero, I found that the only cure for 'Saturday Night Fever' was to escape that world and that life, and leave all the 'beautiful losers' behind.",Null,35,46,30 March 2004
Finding Neverland," First star to the left, and straight on till boring
","I should have realized it was a bad sign 'Finding Neverland' began with a red velvet curtain and a proscenium arch. Yes, I know, James Barrie was a playwright, and 'Peter Pan' began as a play. But that doesn't mean that this movie should have adopted theatrical conventions. That results in a film that is, well, over-dramatic.That's one of the problems with 'Finding Neverland'. It tries too obviously and too hard to tug at our heartstrings. Instead of stirring deep, true emotions in its audience, it succeeds only in engendering a cloying and mawkish sentimentality. And, worse than that, it wrings tears from even its hard-hearted villain -- the grandmother (Julie Christie) of the boys James Barrie (Johnny Depp) befriends.Another problem is that 'Finding Neverland' almost completely sidesteps a key point in any examination of James Barrie's life: the nature of his fondness for the Llewellyn-Davies boys. Barrie was rumored, though never proved, to be a pedophile. Only once in 'Finding Neverland' is this issue raised. As in 'Alexander', our hero's sexuality is not honestly explored. At best, this version of Barrie might be labeled an oddball or an eccentric -- a rather superficial assessment.The point is not to pander to prurient interests, or to dismiss Barrie as some sex-crazed monster. Rather, the film could have considered how he sublimated his desire and transmuted it into art -- in much the same way as homosexual Michelangelo was able to create Adam, David, and the muscle-bound Christ of the Sistine Chapel's 'Last Judgment'.To be sure, in this depiction of Barrie, there are hints of a lost childhood, of growing up too soon. And there is philosophizing about how quickly youth and time pass, till the Grim Reaper claims us all. But 'Finding Neverland' fails to capitalize on an idea suggested by its final scene: that our physical selves may be mortal, but the products of our imagination can live forever. Finally, 'Finding Neverland' is simply too staid, static, and stodgy. Except for the scenes where Barrie engages in imaginative play with the Llewellyn-Davies boys, the film lacks dynamism and energy.I was looking forward to 'Finding Neverland'. But I didn't think I would be finding Neverland dull. For me, this Peter didn't pan out.",Null,1,3,8 December 2004
Monster," The makeup of a monster
","The title of this film lends itself to misinterpretation. It is all too easy to assume that the 'Monster' in question is serial killer Aileen Wuornos, played by Charlize Theron. Yet the script makes it clear that the title refers to an amusement-park Ferris wheel that Aileen (or Lee) rode though it made her nauseous. The Ferris wheel is thus an image or a symbol of how humans are capable of doing unpleasant and downright nasty things to survive.However, the title works on other levels as well. Lee might well be regarded as a monster. The label does not apply so much at the beginning of her killing spree. Her first murder might legitimately be considered a form of self-defence. Even a little later in her criminal career, a case could be made that she has become a kind of vigilante exacting justice for the hurt men have done to her since childhood. But, by the end of the film, Lee becomes a monster because she is presented with a moral choice -- to kill or not to kill someone who is innocent of wrongdoing toward her -- and deliberately chooses to kill. That is when her character crosses the line from hurt human to moral monster.The label 'monster' could also be applied to all the people who have taken advantage of Lee during the course of her life, from her father's friend who raped her at the tender age of eight, to the boys and men who have used her as a prostitute since the age of thirteen, to the one person Lee allowed herself to love -- a young lesbian, here called Selby and played by Christina Ricci. As Shakespeare would say, 'This is the most unkindest cut of all.' Selby, it seems, doesn't mind Lee hooking to earn cash and steal cars and help Selby escape her church-going, whitebread, mid-West American lifestyle. But when the chips are down, Selby is no more there for Lee than anyone else.I found Ricci less than convincing in the role. Her wide-eyed naivete at the start of the film did not ring true for me. She also fails to convey totally why Selby might have been attracted to Lee, or how Selby is able to break free of the strictures of life with her straitlaced parents.Much has been made of Theron's performance as Lee. Roger Ebert has even called her role one of the best in cinema, period. I will concede that Theron may deserve the Best Actress Oscar this year, but I think it is gilding the lily to go beyond that. Again, critics have raved about Theron's transformation from glamorous Hollywood star to plain Jane (shades of Nicole Kidman's nose in 'The Hours'!). But even with her plucked eyebrows, mottled skin, added pounds and false teeth, Theron's ultrafeminine beauty shines through. You can see it in her eyes and in her occasional smile. Even the studiedly nonchalant way she holds a cigarette lapses, at times, into a more girlish type of gesture. As they say, what's bred in the bone will out in the flesh.The problem for me is that we do not see, and thus understand, how Lee morphed from the pretty little girl she once must have been, to the swaggering tough she becomes. Perhaps it is not enough that we are told about her childhood woes. Perhaps we should have been shown more graphically where Lee's troubles began. It takes more than makeup, externally applied, to create a monster. We need to see and understand the makeup within.",Null,0,0,2 February 2004
Shaun of the Dead," A matter of life in death
","Slack-jawed, vacant stare, lurching, staggering gait ... I'm not talking about the zombies in 'Shaun of the Dead'. I'm talking about some of the people I saw after I left the theatre.'Shaun of the Dead' is not scary. What's scary is that there are people out there, around us, among us, who live as though they were zombies. People for whom life is never anything more than working 9 to 5 in a dead-end job, then coming home to spend the evening as couch potatoes in front of the TV or video games. People with no soul or spirituality. People for whom there is no heaven or hell, no thought of survival after death. People for whom mere survival in life is about as much as they can handle.People of whom John Cougar Mellencamp sang, 'Oh yeah, life goes on, long after the thrill of living is gone.'As it turns out, the zombies in 'Shaun of the Dead' are creatures of habit. They may be brain-dead, but they can perform menial, mindless, mechanical tasks -- just like any real live working-class stiff.I was led to believe that 'Shaun of the Dead' was a satire on the modern British middle class. Ghoul Britannia, so to speak. Bangers and monster mash.But 'Shaun of the Dead' is universal in its import, a comedy with a tragic message. And the message is this: The greatest thing modern man has to fear is not death. It is life in death.",Null,1,1,26 September 2004
Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl," Dull and crossbones
","Finally got around to seeing 'Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl'. Rented the DVD and watched it while doing the laundry. You know what? I found myself anxiously waiting for the wash and dry cycles to be finished, so I could have something really fun to do, like fold clothes.Okay, so the 17th-century period costumes are nice, and the photography occasionally interesting (though at times I felt more like I was seeing a rerun of 'Survivor: Pearl Islands'). And the moment when the heroine has her first fainting spell, because she simply can't breathe in her whalebone corset, was hilarious. But that was the only time I laughed.Other than that, 'Pirates of the Caribbean' was a snorefest. I would actually rate it the most boring film I have seen in the past year. And that's saying a lot, since I usually go to the cinema twice a week. The tale of a ghost ship and her skeleton crew goes on (and on) for over two hours, and frankly it is two hours too long.Boy, am I glad I didn't pay full admission to see 'Pirates' at a theatre. That would have been 'avast' mistake.As Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp is mildly amusing with his beads and braids and kohl-laden eyes. But even his highly mannered performance wears thin fast.Depp's parting shot in the film is 'Yo-ho!' I would amend that to 'Yo-ho-hum!'",Null,0,1,27 February 2004
Alexander," Stone and Farrell, defeated by Hephaistion's thighs
","At the beginning of 'Alexander', Ptolemy, Greek pharaoh of Egypt, tells us that 'Alexander was never defeated, except by Hephaistion's thighs'. (This line is no invention of Oliver Stone's, but a quote variously attributed to Cynic philosophers or a poet named Claudius Aelianus.)Alas, what was true of Alexander the hero proves to be equally true of 'Alexander' the film, as well as its director, Oliver Stone, and its lead actor, Colin Farrell. Sad to relate, all three fall on the same stumbling-block: their inability to deal squarely with the importance of Hephaistion in Alexander's life.One wonders what on earth possessed Stone to tackle this project, and to cast Farrell in the title role. Never were two men more ill-suited to the task. Both are fatally hampered by their own swaggering machismo -- and the homophobia that lingers in Hollywood and America at large -- from being able to understand, appreciate and convey, with any verisimilitude, the physical passion and emotional connection that Alexander and Hephaistion must have felt.Stone and Farrell never allow the two historic lovers to do more than give each other a bear hug or, at best, a back rub. There is no on-screen kiss, let alone any nudity or lovemaking.In an early scene, we see Alexander and Hephaistion as 12-year-old boys, wrestling at the gymnasium, chastely clad in loincloths. This is patently inaccurate, since Greek men and boys wore nothing more than olive oil -- and perhaps a laurel wreath -- when they engaged in athletic activities, including the Olympic Games. But in America's current climate of anti-sexual hysteria, it would of course be quite impossible to show the historical reality.This is only one of many anachronisms in the film. For instance, we are told the extent of Alexander's empire in square miles -- an English measure of area, where the Greeks might have used hectares instead. But worst of all, most intrusive and annoying, is the plethora of Irish brogues heard from the male cast, primarily Colin Farrell himself, the young actor who plays Alexander as a boy, and Val Kilmer as his father, Philip of Macedonia. I am tempted to believe that this casting was a deliberate decision, based on Farrell's inability to neutralize his own native accent.Some scenes seemed derivative, echos of other celebrated films. At one point, we see the ground strewn with wounded men, and the camera dollies back for a wide-angle shot. I half expected to see Scarlett O'Hara in her straw bonnet and faded calico dress, and the tattered Confederate flag waving in the breeze.The score by Vangelis also struck me as derivative. One bar in particular sounds strangely familiar -- I'm almost positive it was lifted from an opera aria.The ancient Greeks had a saying that 'an army of lovers cannot fail'. Oliver Stone's 'Alexander' fails for precisely that reason: it does not allow Alexander and Hephaistion to be lovers, as they undoubtedly were in life and will always remain in history.",Null,0,1,25 November 2004
Troy," Homer for Peterson, strikeout for Pitt
","I was originally going to call my review 'Razing Helen, or Greece is the word', but instead I chose the title that best summed up the film.Peterson's Trojan war is waged not only on the battlefield, but in the minds and hearts of men. It is a war of ideas, and indeed a meditation on war itself. Why do men fight? Some for love of country, some for adventure, some for immortality. 'Troy' also addresses the role of religion in men's lives. Some characters in the film honor the gods, others do not. Achilles goes so far as to say that the gods envy men, because human mortality means that we must live each day to the fullest, as if it were our last. And if death is our lot, at least we can avoid oblivion, ensuring that our names live on by golden deeds.Peterson revels in the carnage and mayhem of war, but the film is at its best when it focuses on hand-to-hand conflict between characters we care about, not just nameless, faceless soldiers in armor. It is also fascinating to see how war was waged in an era where cavalry had not yet superseded infantry and artillery.Not everything works in 'Troy'. There are some laughable moments and awkward dialogue. I found myself gathering wool at times. A shot of Helen gazing over the parapets of Troy reminded me of Evita on the balcony of the Casa Rosada. During Brad Pitt's big scene with Peter O'Toole, I half expected Pitt to hiss, 'Give me the Aquitaine!' And the burnt, charred pillars of Troy made me think of Twelve Oaks, the Wilkes' plantation in 'Gone with the Wind'.Peterson's 'Troy' is not entirely faithful to Homer's epic poem. I was disappointed to see several characters end up on the cutting room floor. Women in particular are not very much in evidence. Where, for example, is Priam's queen, Hecuba? Or Cassandra, the truthsayer whose dire prophecies the Trojans failed to heed? Or Iphigenia, sacrificed to the gods to obtain fair winds for sailing? The only real heroine of the film is Briseis, virgin priestess of Apollo (until Achilles comes along).But also missing in action is the male character of Laocoon, crushed to death by a sea serpent for warning about 'Greeks bearing gifts'. Odysseus (Ulysses) might as well not be there. He seems to have been included only as the author of the stratagem that ruined Troy.Pretty boy Orlando Bloom plays Paris. If Christopher Marlowe were living today, he might have written, 'Was this the face that launched a thousand computer-generated ships?' Unfortunately, Paris is such a wimp and a coward that Bloom has little to work with.Brad Pitt is a disappointment as Achilles. Somehow, he seems totally out of place. I think he simply has the wrong face for the role. He is no longer a 'Troy boy', but is looking old and haggard at 40. Perhaps Peterson wanted his Achilles to look war weary -- a hero for the postmodern era. Who knows?Brian Cox's Agamemnon does little but bluster and get red-faced as a tom turkey.The true male stars are Eric Bana as Hector, and the venerable Peter O'Toole as Priam. They alone deliver dialogue that rings true, and Priam's plea for the body of Hector is truly heart-rending.Peterson fudges the ending of the film. Agamemnon does not die in Troy. Rather, he returns home to be butchered by his wife Clytemnestra and her lover. But that's another story.Alas, poor Troy is fallen! But, thanks to the miracle of celluloid, we'll always have Paris. Oh, and among those fleeing the flames of Troy, with his elderly father Anchises, we see Aeneas, hero of Virgil's 'Aeneid'. Is there a sequel in the works?",Null,1,2,18 May 2004
The Day After Tomorrow," Snow job
","Some say the world will end in fire, / Some say in ice. / From what I've tasted of desire / I hold with those who favour fire. / But if it had to perish twice, / I think I know enough of hate / To say that for destruction ice / Is also great / And would suffice. -- Robert Frost, 'Fire and Ice'The snow in 'The Day After Tomorrow' may be deep, but the thinking that went into the film sure wasn't. Apart from fleeting references to Friedrich Nietzsche and the Gutenberg Bible, the Ice Age appears to have obliterated all traces of culture and civilization from the script as well as the city of New York where it is set.I just saw the movie, and it'll be a frosty Friday before I see it again. OK, the computer-generated effects are awesome, with great attention to minute detail. But the acting, story and script are laughably funny. Don't take my word for it. Other people in the audience at my screening felt the same way.Dennis Quaid plays climatologist Jack Hall, whose son Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) is trapped in New York with the global climate gone mad. Our man Jack sets out from Washington D.C. to rescue Sam, and if you think he won't make it in time, you don't know Jack.The science in the film is plausible, I guess, if you believe that the polar ice cap can melt overnight and cover the Northern Hemisphere in ice and snow in three days. (By the way, the opening sequence shows the continental shelf of ANTARCTICA cracking asunder. Why isn't the Southern Hemisphere similarly affected? For that matter, the weather station in Scotland is at a more northern latitude than New York. Why is it not wiped out first?)But the film loses all credibility within the first ten minutes when Dennis Quaid pulls off an action stunt against all odds. You know then that the film has nowhere to go but down, down, down from there.Several characters, who should know better, brave the elements unprotected by face masks or gloves, or -- horrors! -- touch presumably frozen metal with bare hands. Oh, and somebody else touches the metal handle of a door from which electrical sparks were flying a moment previously. Hello, didn't their mothers teach them right?To make a long story short, 'The Day After Tomorrow' is a mindless piece of pseudo-scientific fluff. Sit back, relax, turn off your brain, and don't expect any of it to make any sense. Just go with the floe :)",Null,0,0,30 May 2004
The Polar Express," The ghost of Christmas pasteurized
","I will no doubt be accused of being a Scrooge, but I'm afraid that, for me, 'The Polar Express' was no more than a snow job. Far from arousing my Christmas spirit, the film merely reminded me how much the holiday has been over-sentimentalized and over-commercialized.The instrumental and song score alone was enough to have me muttering 'Bah, humbug!' The music was so in your face that I could almost see the orchestra, especially the string section. It was bad enough having to endure Tom Hanks as the train conductor, without having to contend with the orchestra conductor into the bargain. And then there were all those snippets of classic Christmas carols, both as snatches of the instrumental score and as voiced by Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and the Andrews sisters. They may not have been roasting on an open fire, but they were chestnuts indeed.If I had to sum up 'The Polar Express' in one word, it would be 'annoying'. Instead of telling a story from beginning to end, it seems to go off in all directions, or at least constantly off on a tangent. The stage business of the train ticket carried hither and thither by the winter wind seems suspiciously like an excuse for the animators to show us how very clever they are ('Look, Ma, no hands!'). I was most definitely NOT impressed by the human figures. To my eye, they looked like nothing so much as wax dummies from Madame Tussaud's, and they moved jerkily as well. I might as well as have been watching the string puppets in 'Team America: World Police'.There was, to be honest, only one moment when 'The Polar Express' evoked any real emotion in this reviewer's breast, and that came almost at the very end, when the train conductor punches the children's tickets with a special message for each one.'The Polar Express' takes a host of Christmas traditions and milks them for all their worth. But -- for this critic, at least -- the end result is as flat, warmed-over, and even sour-tasting as a glass of milk left standing overnight for a Santa who never comes.",Null,5,9,16 November 2004
Closer," G-string quartet
","I'm in two minds about 'Closer'. Is it an accurate portrayal of modern relationships? Or is merely a brilliant conceit, a filmed play with clever dialogue that bears no resemblance to reality? Whatever the case, the message of 'Closer' seems to be that truth has very little to do with relationships. Truth is something you hear only the moment your relationship is about to end, not while the two of you are together. Truth doesn't bring you closer. It only drives you apart.There's a scene in 'Closer' that involves a very racy exchange between two unlikely individuals in an Internet chat room. One of the two people chatting is merely adopting an online persona. He is not at all who or what he claims to be. The other is at least true to his nature as a sexual animal -- in his own words, a 'caveman'. Perhaps there is a message there too: that we are truest when we are true to ourselves.The caveman in question is Larry, played with raw energy and passion by Clive Owens. Of the four protagonists, Larry is the most real and true. Alice (Natalie Portman) is hiding behind an assumed identity, though she is ironically a stripper who lays herself bare to strangers. Dan (Jude Law) projects an image of macho bravado, but is actually a sniveling, weepy, whiny little boy lost. As for Anna (Julia Roberts), she is an ice-cold maiden who sees genuine human emotion only as fodder for her artwork as a photographer.All of these characters confuse wanting to be loved with wanting to be needed -- or to dominate and control. And they all confuse wanting to hear the truth with their real desire to be lulled by lies.This film could have explored modern relationships even more deeply. There were hints of sexual tension between Dan and Larry, and between Anna and Alice. The movie would be longer, but the end result would be the same. It seems that, whether you're gay or straight, when it comes to love, nothing could be farther from the truth.",7,2,5,9 December 2004
Van Helsing," Evil without reflection
","We all know that Dracula, or any vampire, cannot be seen in a mirror. 'Van Helsing' is the same. It is evil without reflection. At least Dracula has the excuse of being undead. 'Van Helsing' is far worse. It is brain-dead.The film never pretends to be anything other than park-your-mind-at-the-door entertainment, in the tradition of fast-paced, car-chase-filled, action-adventure flicks. Given its subject matter, 'Van Helsing' could and should have tried to be something more. Its failure to rise above the abysmal is an abdication of moral responsibility.The film offers the semblance of evil without examining its nature or reality. It trots out all the classic ghouls - vampires, werewolves, Jekyll and Hyde, Dr. Frankenstein and his monster - without stopping to consider what makes them such powerful archetypes, or why they are deemed the embodiment of evil.Even a cursory examination would have revealed the answer. All of them are unnatural exaggerations of an aspect of human nature. Both Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein represent people's wish to 'be as gods' - to quote Genesis - to be immortal or to unlock the secret to life. (Van Helsing himself seems to live forever. He remembers fighting Romans at Masada in 73 AD.) Hyde and the werewolf, on the other hand, show us at our worst, when we allow ourselves to be dominated by our animal instincts.Frankenstein's monster holds out a ray of hope as the one creature that is non-human yet not inhuman. Van Helsing says he cannot kill Frankenstein's monster because, although it may be the fruit of evil, it is not ruled by evil.Apart from this one bright spot, however, the film's moral vision (if you can call it that) is chilling indeed. Ultimately, 'Van Helsing' suggests that evil must be defeated and destroyed by evil itself. The film offers no choice between good and evil. It allows us only to choose the lesser of two evils.The film uses the props of Christian theology without its underpinnings. Churches become mere architectural splendors, not holy but hollow. No divine worship takes place beneath their vaults. God and the devil are mentioned in passing, but neither has any real presence. (I use the term deliberately.) Reference is made to sin and salvation - but they are merely meaningless buzzwords. Holy water and the crucifix no longer vanquish evil.At no time in the proceedings does 'Van Helsing' ever manage to be scary. The only truly frightening thing about the film is that, as the saying goes, it 'sees no evil'. If this is any indication of how far our society has lost its moral compass, then we must indeed 'be afraid - be very afraid'.",Null,0,0,12 May 2004
Collateral," Cruise in cab rhymes with snooze 'n gab
","This will probably be one of the shortest reviews I've ever written, mainly because I walked out of the film after 45 minutes. I spent about a half-hour dozing off, put to sleep by the soporific script. The only reason I stayed another 15 minutes was to finish my Coke.Granted, the photography is great, and so is the music, if you like jazz. But the opening sequence is nothing but interminable chatter, and when the real action starts, none of it seems to make very much sense.Jamie Foxx and Mark Ruffalo don't exactly help to liven up the proceedings, but Cruise is the real problem with the film. For one thing, he's too impossibly clean-cut, well-tailored and soft-spoken to be credible as a thug. And that face -- that eternally boyish face. Even at 40, Cruise has the air of a kid who is still waiting for his beard to grow, his voice to break, and his Adam's apple to emerge. He doesn't look remotely like a hood. Not even a boy in the 'hood. A boy in a hoodie, perhaps.Do yourself a favor. Give this L.A. cab a miss, and save yourself the fare. Don;t even rent the DVD.

Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Twice told tale
","If you ask me, 'Prisoner of Azakaban', directed by Alfonso Cuaron (Y Tu Mama Tambien), is the weakest Harry Potter film so far.For one thing, there is too much visual gimmickry, too many comings and goings, too many extras on the set. (Yes, I know it's a magic school, but must we see all of its alumni at the same time?) I have not read any of the Harry Potter novels and thus am not a purist who expects every minute, infinitesimal detail of J.K. Rowling's world to be transcribed from the book to the big screen. I think 'Prisoner of Azkaban' should have been less scattered and more focused.For another thing, I found the pace far too slow. In fact, the film often dragged, and I honestly thought it would never end.As if that isn't bad enough, we are obliged to sit through the end of the story, not once, but twice. The film is thus at least a half hour longer than it really needs to be. (I assume this is Ms. Rowling's fault, not Mr. Cuaron's.)That being said, there were a few things about 'Prisoner of Azkaban' that I genuinely liked. I was mesmerized every time the Dementors made an appearance. Transforming Aunt Madge into a balloon was less interesting than the fact that this was a manifestation of teenage Harry's pent-up anger. (And I couldn't help seeing a film reference here to the telekinesis in 'Carrie'.) Finally, I loved the scene where Harry casts a spell to protect himself and Sirius Black ('Exspecto patronum').Back on the minus side, I found Professor Trelawny (Emma Thompson) just too loony for words. And is it just me, or is Minerva McGonigle's Scottish burr getting thicker with each installment of the franchise? I swear Maggie Smith is still channelling Jean Brodie! I just hope she doesn't start referring to the junior witches at Hogwarts as 'my gels'.I don;t know whether to attribute this to the dialogue from the novel or to Mr. Cuaron's personal sensibilities, but I counted about a half dozen gay references. For instance, near the end of the film, Professor Lupin says that parents will not want 'someone like me' teaching their children. And can Draco Malfoy be any gayer? But I digress ...What really holds my interest is Harry's continuing quest to discover the truth about his parents and his past. What will he find at the end of the road? 'Exspecto proximum' ... I await the sequel.",Null,0,0,8 June 2004
The Butterfly Effect," Puk'd
","The tag line for 'The Butterfly Effect' is 'Change one thing. Change everything.' The title of the film comes from the principle in chaos theory that even the flap of a butterfly's wings in one part of the world can, by a concatenation of causes and effects, trigger a typhoon elsewhere on the planet. The premise of 'The Butterfly Effect' is thus that change is possible.However, what Evan (Ashton Kutcher) keeps trying to change is the past. This is patently impossible, yet -- defying all logic-- he 'achieves' it several times in the course of the film. Each time, he only succeeds in making a bad situation worse, until he finally 'makes it perfect'.The problem is that the final adjustment he makes does not really solve anything. The one piece of the puzzle that causes the entire problem remains unchanged, and that is the character played by Eric Stolz. If he is not eliminated from the scene, his evil influence continues to poison the lives of those around him. 'The Butterfly Effect' thus fails miserably in terms of plotting and script, no matter how well the characters may be played.This is indeed a pity. I went into the film with high expectations that it might provide a breakthrough role for Ashton Kutcher, one that might free him from the stereotype of being someone's toyboy. Needless to say, I was sorely disappointed. And so, I bet, was Ashton.",Null,0,0,25 January 2004
The Chorus," One-note performances, familiar refrain
","It seems 'The Choir' (Les Choristes) is a sensation in its native France, doing big box-office as a film and selling like hotcakes as a soundtrack. One imagines that France will hasten to enter it in the race for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars this year (2004).'The Choir' is undeniably a well-made film. But it is not a great film, nor is it even a memorable film. And it certainly doesn't deserve the golden statuette.'The Choir' is a nice film, a wistful bit of misty-eyed, rose-colored sentimentality. But it is farm from original, creative or imaginative.It is, instead, a rehash and a mishmash of images and ideas cribbed from other films. The conflict between a kindly new teacher and a crusty old headmaster has been done to death. There have been other, more hard-hitting films about the cruelty of life in reform schools for wayward or abandoned boys. And there have even been other films about a motley crew whipped into shape and ennobled by art, music or theater.'The Choir' simply follows a recipe, blends all these elements, and serves up a tepid broth that is more comfort food than cuisine.The screenplay and characterization make few demands on the cast. This is the sort of thing French actors can do in their sleep. (Perhaps they do.)Even Jacques Perrin's character, Pierre Morhange, is a throwback to an earlier role in his career. In 'Cinema Paradiso', Perrin played a middle-aged filmmaker mourning the death of a childhood mentor, and celebrating his legacy -- a collection of film clips spliced together. In 'The Choir', Perrin is a middle-aged symphony conductor who learns that a father figure has passed away, leaving him a legacy of memories set down in writing.Good grief, couldn't the producers of 'The Choir' show even a little imagination, and at least cast somebody else as the elder Pierre?",Null,7,15,24 October 2004

","What would happen if Superman hung up his cape, gave up his superpowers, and settled down with Lois Lane (or his childhood sweetheart Lana Lang) on the outskirts of Metropolis? For that matter, what kind of life would Batman and Robin have as Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, a plain, ordinary gay couple living la vida loca in Gotham City?That's the kind of question 'The Incredibles' sets out to answer -- and fails. This animated film could have been a truly funny satire of married, monogamous (monotonous?), suburban society. Instead, it aims for the lowest common denominator and settles for being a cartoon version of your average 'guy movie' -- an action-packed adventure filled with chases and things blowing up all over the place, but no real heart and precious few brains.The only saving grace in 'The Incredibles' is Holly Hunter's spirited voicing of Helen Parr (a.k.a. Elastigirl). Craig T. Nelson, as Bob Parr (alias Mr. Incredible), shows potential but is not allowed to develop it to the fullest. The super-children in this little family -- Dash, Violet and baby Jack -- simply fly under the radar. That's a real shame, because Violet starts out as a teenager faced with the universal adolescent task of fitting in and being liked, especially by a cute boy at school. But her character development is as flat and one-dimensional as a Marvel comic book.'The Incredibles' should have burned as brightly as Krypton's twin suns. Instead, for me at least, the film simply turned out to be as deadly as a fragment of Kryptonite.",Null,1,2,9 November 2004
Garden State," This is your brain off drugs
","Okay, here's the concept. Andrew Largeman (Zach Braff) has been on antidepressants for 16 years, ever since he was a young boy, and thus has not been able to deal with some fundamental issues in his life. Suddenly, his mother passes away, and he returns to Newark, New Jersey, to attend her funeral and face his past.Only he doesn't, really, and that's one of the problems with this film. The media hype leads you to believe Largeman must deal with some deep dark secret, and you expect a major confrontation with his psychiatrist father (Ian Holm). We get neither of these things.What we get instead is an array of characters that are each, in their way, as weird and peculiar as Largeman himself. I guess the idea is that, no matter how strange one's circumstances may be, normal is relative. (Hey, that would make a good tag line.)But that's like saying that all families are dysfunctional. It's a truism, a self-evident truth. And besides, Tolstoy said it already, and better, in the opening line of 'Anna Karenina'' 'Happy families are all alike. Unhappy families are each unhappy in their own way.'Don't get me wrong. The cast of 'Garden State' is wonderful. As Largeman, Zach Braff is physically reminiscent of a young John Ritter in his 'Three's Company' glory days. As the mother of one of his friends, Jean Smart is a dead ringer for Shirley Jones in 'The Partridge Family'. Ian Holm is in fine form as always. And Natalie Portman shines as compulsive liar Sam.There are some funny gags along the way, too. You haven't lived until you've heard 'Three Times a Lady' sung with a Jersey accent. And there is a rather unusual dog trick you've probably never seen before, and probably won't care to see again.Ultimately, however, all this weirdness becomes too much to absorb, and this critic's brain simply shut off. To put it another way, all this dysfunctionality is ... well, dysfunctional. 'Garden State' is just too damn quirky for its own good.",Null,2,4,23 August 2004
Shrek 2," Fairy-tale farce too fast and fleeting
","'Shrek 2' is definitely not for the kiddies. In fact, I fail to see how it can be truly appreciated by anyone under the age of 20. A lot of the in-jokes and clins d'oeil go back too far for Generation X to have a clue. Take the cinematic references to films such as 'Ghostbusters' and 'Flashdance', for instance. And there's a verbatim quote from 'Rocky Horror Picture Show' that is said so quickly and quietly that you could easily blink and miss it. (Puss in Boots says at one point, 'I've got to hold on, or I too shall go mad' -- Dr. Scott's words during the floor show before he lifts the plaid blanket and unveils his fishnet-stockinged legs.)That's my main complaint about 'Shrek 2'. There are lots of satirical send-ups of films, brand names and so on -- but they are just one-second sight gags or one-liners. You may not have enough time to catch them on the fly, let alone savor them, before the fast-paced farce moves on to something else.Fairy Godmother brings a new kind of cartoon villainness to the screen. Her brand of evil -- if you can call it that -- lies in her crass commercialism (she has a business card and a web site), her sweat-shop practices (her elves don't have a dental plan), and her scheming to marry her son Charming to Fiona. On the plus side, Fairy Godmother does look fetching as she lounges on a piano in a clingy red sequined gown (like Michelle Pfeiffer in 'The Fabulous Baker Boys'), and she sure can belt out 'Holding Out for a Hero'. I never expected to hear or see the word 'lust' in an animated film, but that's the final ingredient in one of Fairy Godmother's potions. Oh, and her coachman cracks a mean whip ... Shades of SM! Fairy Godmother comes by her bawdiness and ribaldry honestly, since she is played by Jennifer Saunders (Edina in the TV series 'Absolutely Fabulous').Princess Fiona seems rather less feisty this time around. She mainly wants the acceptance and blessing of her royal parents on her marriage to her ogre of a husband, Shrek. Her mother, Queen Lillian, is equally lacking in chutzpah. Indeed, Julie Andrews' considerable acting talents are sadly wasted on this doormat of a character. Even Maria von Trapp and Mary Poppins were worthier heroines.But at least Fiona and Lillian are flawed flesh-and-blood human beings, and not annoying animals, like Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas). Eddie Murphy's antics set my teeth on edge as much as Cuba Gooding's (literal) horsing around in 'Home on the Range'. Is it just me, or do animated films smack of racism, assigning these kinds of roles to Black and Hispanic actors?In 'Home on the Range', Disney's last hand-drawn animated film, the audience is set up for a single film reference: 'Is this the end of Rico?' -- Edward G. Robinson's dying words in 'Little Caesar'. I'm still laughing and shaking my head about that one. 'Shrek 2' might learn a thing or two from this. You don't always have to pull out all the stops. A little can go a very, very long way.",Null,0,0,23 May 2004
Big Fish," Burton's best
","I have seen several Tim Burton films (Batman, Edward Scissorhands, A Nightmare before Christmas). I must admit that my opinion of him was primarily shaped by the look and feel of Batman, which I found far too dark and, above all, cluttered. I was thus delighted by Big Fish, which I found light, airy and sunny by comparison.The two people I saw the film with were less than enthused. Both felt that running time was too long at almost two and a half hours. One thought the film's flights of fancy were a little too fanciful for his tastes. But I felt the length (and pace) were exactly right for the story Big Fish has to tell, and ditto for its fancifulness. If you're going to tell a tale, as Edward Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan MacGregor) does, you might as well make it as tall as Paul Bunyan and as big as Babe the blue ox. If Edward Bloom's tales were shorter and more down to earth, they would be nothing more than a traveling salesman's jokes -- and his character would correspondingly be reduced in size and stature to that of a mere mortal, not a man among men.The casting of the film is phenomenal -- by this, I mean the physical resemblance between the actors and actresses who play Edward Bloom (Albert Finney/Ewan MacGregor) and his wife Sandra Templeton (Jessica Lange/Alison Loman). Finney is endlessly fascinating as the raconteur and should be remembered at Oscar time. MacGregor is charming as always as the younger Bloom. Jessica Lange says remarkably little, but conveys in nonverbal ways Sandra's loving indulgence of her husband's big fish stories.I defy anyone to see this film and leave the theatre dry-eyed. The final sequences certainly left me with a tear in my eye and a lump in my throat. And that is because the film made me care about its hero as a real human being, however unreal his version of himself may be. More than that -- the film taught me a valuable lesson for my own life, one I was much in need of being taught again: that we must accept people on their own terms, for who they are and aspire to be -- not who we would like them to be. And how often can you say of a Hollywood film that it has had an impact on your life?",Null,0,0,12 January 2004
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," An affair to forget
","Ah, Valentine's Day! For lovers, it's wonderful. But if you're not in a relationship, or your relationship has gone sour, February 14 is the saddest day of the year.That's the first lesson of 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', and it is a truism, a bromide, a trite and hackneyed notion. Love hurts ... What a concept?That's just one of the reasons I found this film, um, forgettable. Oh, technically, it's mildly interesting for its disjointed storytelling and the neat way objects fade or quickly disappear from view. And Kate Winslet is certainly quirky as Clementine, erstwhile girlfriend to Joel (Jim Carrey). But the rest of the cast are largely wasted, and this is not the breakthrough dramatic role for Carrey that it was hyped to be.It isn't until the final reel that we clue in to what might be the moral of the film: Even if our memories were erased, we would still gravitate to the same person all over again. In other words, some people are meant to be together.The film quotes Friedrich Nietzsche (not once, but twice): 'Blessed are the forgetful: for they get the better even of their blunders.' Does this mean that we learn from our mistakes? Apparently not. Both Joel and Clementine, and Howard and Mary, make the same mistakes all over again. At least Clementine is honest about being 'just a f***ed-up person looking for her peace of mind'.But if the message of 'Eternal Sunshine' is that we are doomed to go on f***ing up, even when the slate is wiped clean and we are given a second chance, then -- with the film as with life -- why bother?'Eternal Sunshine' is full of truisms, it seems. Yet it misses the truest and saddest reality of all. You don't need the services of Lacuna Inc. to make your memories go away. Time does that for free.",Null,0,1,28 March 2004
Saw," Could have been sharper
","'Saw' begins with an intriguing premise and, for most of the film, is a taut, tight, suspenseful cat-and-mouse game. The promise of the title is fulfilled -- as the old proverb says, if a gun is introduced in the first act, it should go off by the fifth act. Indeed it does, and we are not disappointed.Where the film loses its sharpness and becomes blunted and dull, like an old rusty saw, is in the final reel. There are simply too many red herrings, undeveloped or underdeveloped characters, unlikely twists and turns, unanswered questions, and an ending that ultimately fails to satisfy.Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell are, by and large, excellent as the trapped surgeon and darkroom photographer. In an interesting dynamic or dialectic, Dr. Lawrence Gordon initially approaches his dilemma with cool, calm logic, only to descend into a maelstrom of madness. Adam, his fellow prisoner, starts out as impulsive and unthinking, but grows increasingly cagier and slyer. The shift in the dynamic between them genuinely proves to be a see-saw battle (pun intended).However, 'Saw' woefully wastes the thespian talents of the likes of Danny Glover. The rest of the cast embody cardboard characters and simply go through the motions.'Saw' should have been cutting-edge cinema. In the end, however, it should perhaps have been left on the cutting-room floor.",Null,0,0,9 November 2004
Ray," The hero and the heroin
","'Ray' is being touted as one of the best films of the year and an Oscar contender in that category. I would not rate it so highly. It is certainly a competent, well-made biopic, but a fairly standard and conventional one.The film's analysis of Ray Charles' private demons seems to boil down to this: he shot heroin into his veins to deaden the survivor guilt of his younger brother's tragic death, and slept around with women to compensate for having been wrenched away from his beloved mama. This is a little too facile and perilously close to psychobabble.As for his genius, talent and success, one supposes (along the same lines) that his blindness enabled him to hear more finely. There is one scene in the film where seven-year-old Ray becomes aware, for the first time, of the sounds of the world around him. I can only compare this to the moment in 'The Miracle Worker' where Helen Keller (Patty Duke) realizes that W-A-T-E-R spelled in her palm is the fresh cold liquid Teacher spills onto her hand from the handpump.'Ray' certainly demonstrates the range of his musical talent and his impact on music history. We see how he combines rhythm and blues with gospel, to the consternation of some who see the blend as sacrilegious, 'the devil's music'. We see his music cross over into pop and even reflect classical influences, as in 'Color My World'. There is one piece in the film ('What'd I Say?') in which I swear I heard echoes of The Doors' 'Riders on the Storm'.Jamie Foxx is phenomenal as Ray Charles, but his is the only male role of any real substance. However, four actresses turn in equally strong performances as his mother, his wife, and two of his lovers.The business about Ray Charles' refusal to play to a segregated audience in Georgia is of historical interest, no doubt, but seems to come out of left field and does not fit very well into the rest of the narrative. It's as if the filmmakers felt the need for a hero to counterbalance the heroin.The film is a tad long (close to three hours), and I did find myself wondering where it was going and how it was going to end. Art, unlike life, cannot be messy and disorganized; it requires shaping and a sense of ultimate purpose. 'Ray' might have burned a little more brightly if it had a sharper focus.",Null,0,1,30 October 2004
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," We're off to see the Wizard (POSSIBLE SPOILERS)
","'Lord of the Rings: Return of the King' is undoubtedly a masterpiece of motion picture wizardry. (I use the term purposely.) It is a stunning technical achievement in its creation of a medieval world with its characteristic armor and architecture, as well as a daunting physical landscape.However, a little technology goes a long way. I frequently felt as if I would be needing a dose of Gravol by the time the film ended, with all the dizzying, plunging overhead shots. At first, they overwhelmed me. At the film went on, however, I found them repetitive and annoying. At such moments, Peter Jackson seemed less like a wizard than the sorcerer's apprentice.Apart from the technical side of things, the characters of LOTR: ROTK appear to be made out of cardboard, the dialogue sounds corny (quite an achievement for a film based on Tolkien) and I really didn't give a rat's ass about the outcome. To be quite honest, the only really interesting figure in all of this was Smegol/Gollum.I couldn't help feeling that Peter Jackson must have seen 'The Wizard of Oz' as a child and been influenced by it, subconsciously or otherwise. When Frodo Baggins takes leave of Sam, Merry and Pippin at the end of their adventures, it is hard not to be reminded of Dorothy, the Scarecrow, the Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion (with Gandalf standing in for Glinda). And in an earlier scene, when Frodo is lying in bed recovering and all his friends come in (those just mentioned, plus Aragorn and Legolas), it is again reminiscent of the scene where Dorothy regains consciousness back in her Kansas farmhouse. All that was missing was Toto and the sepia color of the film. There were other possible clins d'oeil, too. The flying pterodactyls (or whatever they were) certainly called to mind the Winged Monkeys of Nikko. And aerial shots of the city under siege looked a lot like the Wicked Witch's castle. Perhaps 'Dark Side of the Moon' would work as a score for LOTR: ROTK as well. Who knows?Anyway, the trilogy has thankfully come to an end. Now it's time to kick the Hobbit.",Null,0,0,13 January 2004
Shall We Dance," Should be called 'Silly Dunce'
","In 'A Gift from the Sea', Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote, 'A good relationship has a pattern like a dance ... There is no place here for the possessive clutch, the clinging arm, the heavy hand; only the barest touch in passing.'If only the screenwriter of 'Shall We Dance?' had heeded this sage advice! This American remake might then have maintained the grace, charm and delicacy of the Japanese original.Alas, instead we have the 'heavy hand' clobbering the audience over the head with the clumsiest lack of subtlety, the broadest stereotypes, a lackluster script and -- as a result -- a singular lack of true-to-life characters that we feel for and care about, a woeful absence of on-screen chemistry among the principals, let alone the bit players.Stanley Tucci should sue his agent for landing him the part of Linc, the bald solicitor who expresses his 'true' inner self by donning a wig worthy of Tiny Tim and gaudy satin tights like some flamboyant superhero. His desire to dance and be himself is cruelly ridiculed by co-workers imbued with American culture's narrowly defined notions of masculinity.Bobby Cannavale should be shot for accepting a role where (yet another) character 'plays it straight' until the final reel. His smouldering sensuality panders to gay male desire, yet frustrates any possibility of identification with the object of desire.The only moment of truth, the 'one true thing' in this film, is a speech by Susan Sarandon about the purpose of marriage. We all need 'a witness to our lives', she says.It's too bad that 'Shall We Dance?' fails to witness the lives of gay men who are obliged to pass for straight, and straight men who are unfairly branded as gay.This film should have been called 'Silly Dunce'. That title would bear witness to the witlessness of the writer who spawned this awful film.",Null,1,4,19 October 2004
