Hereditary," Left Me Shaken...True Horror
","I watched this movie over two weeks ago but can just now write about it. I applaud the creators of this film for giving us a truly sinister tale without the extra blood and gore. When the truth is unraveled it's sticks to you, it made me question my faith in people at the end. Definitely worth watching if you're a fan of true suspense/horror minus the ridiculous blood and guts in today's films. But don't watch alone.",9,1,3,30 January 2019
