The Perks of Being a Wallflower," What a sweet,wonderful film!
","I'm a 60-year-old guy who's never been lucky enough to fall in love but I love watching other people, especially kids, fall in love. This film was perfect for me. It took you through every imaginable emotion that teenagers would experience. It covers a range of themes, including drugs (a little) and homosexuality (a little more).There are many funny moments and it was touching throughout. All the young performers are superb in their roles. These are performances they will always be proud of. I got so involved with the main characters, I was gripping my seat a couple of times. I don't want to give away any of the main plot points. I'll just say that it is a heartwarming story very well told. If you were a teenager once or you're just a sucker for a good story about young love, don't miss this movie!",10,3,6,13 October 2012
Cloud Atlas," A must see film
","Fans of the Matrix films (I haven't seen them) will rush to see Cloud Atlas because two of its three directors made those movies. Others will be drawn in because of its main stars, Halle Berry and Tom Hanks. The draw for me was the third director, Tom Tykwer (Run Lola Run, Perfume, 3). Tykwer is simply one of the greatest directors alive today. He's never disappointed me.The best word to describe Cloud Atlas is astonishing. Some potential viewers may be daunted by the film's nearly three hour length. Don't be. This is the quickest three hours I've ever spent at the movies. The time really flew by. The directors' decision to have their actors play multiple roles is a good one. You may want to spend time trying to figure out which performers are playing what roles, but I recommend against it. Just relax and allow yourself to be drawn in to the various plot lines. You will be quickly be mesmerized.This a truly unique film, the best I've seen this year. Try to see it with one or more friends. You'll be talking about it for a long time.",10,8,18,28 October 2012
