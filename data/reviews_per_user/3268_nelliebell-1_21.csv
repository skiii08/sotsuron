Requiem for a Dream," The Plague of Blood
","This movie is as you might suspect given the many reviews which are before and after not quite what it appears to be and that is why whatever it looks or sounds like it is not what you get.The confusing premise is that there is virtually no ability to balance the tables.What does that mean?This movie is not honest,thats what it means.The horrible opening scene has this young white male attempting as we are to quickly learn, to virtually steal his mothers television set and sell it for a few bucks so he might buy drugs.His mother has the television chained to the radiator so as not to lose touch with whatever reality the television represents but passes the key to of all people her son the drug addict who is threatening her from behind a locked door.Here the author establishes a relationship that is in a nutshell what he is trying to figure out.Though this young person,her son is nothing but a liar and everyone associated with him share and provide impetus for his and there lying ways even unto the death of the other through lethal injection.That lethal injection is a main lining shot of Heroin which these characters are guilty of being part of which involves a loss of a limb as well as the death of the lie that they lived under.However the other end of this film is the relationship of the television to this kids mother which as it turns out is made to appear to be selling drugs of another sort.The weight reducing hysteria turns television and its programs into an accomplice to another kind of tragedy that involves the power of suggestion and the extremely cruel and aggressive nature of having influence over society by way of its programing and power as such.The film continues to show such grossly unjust and even indecent characterizations that we are really forced to look elsewhere for the answer as to the reason why this would exist at all,even if it is dishonest.This film is championing getting your way and believing it is indeed your way even as you are about to die of a overdose of heroin.The source then is not a reliable gauge as to value and contributes to the demise of society by providing a influence that is indecent.It is one thing in this world that we live in to be taken advantage of but it is another to be forced into an idealogical state that does not provide anything else but that.How can in all the world a system baring witness to undue influence,unfair power over and a lie to boot be looked at as the source of anything but an inhuman aggregate with gang like assumptions.It is not so smart to suggest that this film is providing the eclipse of life unto death even through its title,'Requiem for a Dream'.The Dream it seams is dead,however that may not be the worst thing because it hardly had a chance in this world of the power of suggestion and here we are touching upon reality and the effect it has had upon the human race.If you get put off by this well this is what this picture is about.It is symbolic of an intent to kill honesty it is also bears witness to a foreign power in the likes of the influence of the technology that bears malice for its victims and is of such a predatory nature as to be a threat to civilization and even world peace.This discourse is not for the benefit of the writer nor does it provide an answer to anything but getting ones way which is why I cannot give the writer credit but can suggest that the influence written of, got what it wanted, credit for getting its way.Everything in its wake is lessened by such an accomplishment and even more so we are provided with a lie.This film has all the earmarks of a spear aimed at the heart of the human race.Just so you will know with so much power you must be selling something?I do not recommend this film outside of its political importance and that I believe you should be warned as well because it is a living breathing reality that made for this film and it is a living breathing reality that made it possible.That is what this film did, it provided an ability to know reality and if your wise enough you will be forewarned of its coming.Don't sell the sell short it means what it suggests and it intends to convince you that it means to get its way.",1,4,7,20 January 2005
Ghost," Ditto
","Perhaps it is worth a mention prior to anything more serious that unfolds with Ghost, however the very opening sequence is both eerie and initially hard to define.The quick movement to a sort of pedestrian interplay removes the stark and if you will undefinable aspect of the very opening with the braking down some old wall and as viewers we are then provided with the story that as suggested as pedestrian.If I recall even the music attached to the scene however short its appearance equaled a position that was more interesting than its duration allowed for,however it did not seem to have been meant to provide much more than that.Ghost,like so many movies,provides the viewer with what appears but does not allow for what is.The question when any pretense requires our cooperation is if in fact what we are being asked is either worthy or in fact believable?Is what we are being asked by our watching this picture worthy of a more serious consideration?The story is not so easy to unravel as the supra natural plays a part in the drama and even allows for our lead male to provide an unflinching dare as to the eternity that awaits.It is without question a brave and desirable emotion that makes for the truth and that is what is believed in.The lead is worthy but some of the other aspects are not.Sam Wheat is a genuine good guy and though we do not perceive this initially he is very intelligent and even accomplished as his position with the bank symbolizes.The counter to Sam Wheat is not so easy to pigeon hole as both Molly Jensen and Carl Bruner are very much on the same side as both seek to deny the existence of perhaps a soul but just as important to deny Sam Wheat a life.This though is not customary in the consideration of Molly but there is nothing in her characterization that would suggest to me that they not only knew each other but truly loved each other as well.I felt we were not looking at the real thing but the mere suggestion which is as it is a mere suggestion.It is a critical perception to understand that there is cause as to why nothing that can be suggested is believed in either.The Law as to these events is so uncaring and unbelieving that they sought out the truth to kill more so than to be convinced otherwise that there is a truth of any sort to be gained.The only truth the law recognizes is the law and the law needs to get its way.What does that mean?It means that there are many weaknesses to this pictures underpinning and the presence or for that matter the place that law enforcement should represent is terribly lacking and without a face,it is without a heart.There is such compelling evidence that any real detective work would of uncovered Carl Bruner and Willy Lopez and perhaps required both Federal as well as International Law concerns with the revealing of the person on the other end of the phone.But this picture seems to have drawn a conclusion about something else and it is something else that it wants to showcase.Molly like Carl does much to deny the existence of the heart and soul of the picture by not allowing for some far fetched idea about the supra natural but it seems is won over by perhaps the pictures lead Female in Oda Mae Brown.The character of Oda Mae Brown has the ability to communicate with the dead and it is the place that Sam Wheat finds a kindred soul and a receiver if you will for his cries from the world beyond that allow this picture some leeway.Indeed both Sam Wheat and Oda Mae Brown are critical to love and justice even unto the end of time.Both of these performances are very good and should provide real entertainment.Molly is not as suggested a full bodied presence though indeed the appearances suggest otherwise but that is neither here nor there as Molly does not believe and as such has a more difficult time determining just how that kind of information became the property of some foreign body in this character Oda Mae Brown.She eventually seems to have been won over but not before the very soul of the picture rises having been provided with the truth so that the heart and life being required now leaves this world behind and is allowed to rest in peace.The end of the picture is very good,it is if you will a truly emotional parting and an ascension that is believed in.A degree of success is achieved through this if you will miracle however it is very lovely and very charming and well worth the viewing pleasure of the audience.The darkness that awaits all who heed not to repent will befall them as they did to the Willy Lopez and Carl Bruner character.There deaths in the picture occur with a chilling fearful acknowledgment of the designs of the darkness and the results that it provides for.It is a true admission when Carl gets it in the end and like a moment in time does not believe that the end of time has come for this particular criminal.This is where the picture does provide some interest and it is in its attempt to a moral underpinning that allow for the furtherance of the supra natural conceit showcased through out the picture.Why conceit?Because that is where the answers are not here in this world but in the supra natural and though it is the supra natural,the underpinning is of a world that we do not possess the natural ability to know which only through some sort of miracle we will ever have just that kind of ability.",8,3,5,20 January 2006
Spartacus," I'am Spartacus ! I'am Spartacus ! I'am Spartacus!
","The Roman State, was a God Less conquerer of any peoples with whom it fought.A virtual slave state whose slaves were not Jews, they were not Negroes, these were the peoples of conquered nations.Rome was without hope,and slavery bore this out.In the beginning there was Spartacus for whom the end of his place on this earth was drawing near.Spartacus,played by Kirk Douglas was seemingly spared death at least for a time when a slave trader played by Peter Ustinov purchased him and a number of other slaves.They were spared the indignity of dying without dignity though now they were to be trained as gladiators.A fierce fighter who training skills were like a well mannered butcher.The often times grueling training that these persons,slaves one and all was having an affect as some knew better and swore by a code that they would not kill the other.This virtual brotherhood was thematic in its treatment with Spartacus very early on nearly dying in an attempt to relieve the suffering of a slave who had just fallen to the ground when Roman Guards struck blows about the body of Spartacus for the attempt to assist a fallen slave.The slave was not necessarily a male, women,or even child.It is interesting to watch how Spartacus and a women named Varinia(played by Jean Simmons)get to know each other.There scenes for the most part are very dramatically portrayed,often moving even to the touch and if eyes could talk they surely talked the talk if you will.Jean Simmons as Varinia was moving dramatically and on par with some very excellent emotional interplay with the man whom, all called out, I'am Spartacus I'am Spartacus.Though this is not in jest this is a real romance and it is convincing.There is such detail and care that it would not matter when you were to look upon their scenes together,though the crucification is difficult to own up to.It is a real tug and a real sentiment that I did not disagree with.It is further worth mentioning of how decadent a world it is when it looks upon the human kind as slave.It is this terribly innocuous folly that is conducted at the gladiator school when guests the like accompany General Crassus(played by Lawrence Olivier) stop by and want two pairs of gladiators to fight till the death.The persons in attendance are Roman Elite and though money is paid for this exhibition it provides a change in the atmosphere at the school where there motto was that no gladiator would die in training at the school.The thematic material is here made evident and a heroic position is taken front stage.I believe it is Woody Strobe who plays Draba(triton-weapon).It serves to further the unrest though I would guess you can push a human being just so far before a revolt occurs and the gladiators never look back.The revolt spreads and though payback is a bitch it is highly any the more of what it was until that point in time when Spartacus becomes the leader of this revolt.Spartacus is interesting because the landscape requires a broad stroke and it is a broad stroke that this film never seems to fill.There is much to this film which is the equal to mob rule and though Spartacus leads,he leads an army of slaves(free or not)(some children,women,elderly)against what is a most certain death.The end draws near and helpless as the lot of humanity may be they still are lead to near annihilation.There is effective storytelling that is portrayed by one Antoninus played by Tony Curtis and yet the end indeed is again portrayed as a most certain death.If there is any point would it not be that Rome was a murderously ruthless thug whose predilection for the perverse and the corrupt are here made real.Rome is again ruled not by the rule of presumably the Law but by the conquering while all the while maintaining a slave state.There is much to the conceit of this film,that Rome knew no lover and that the inability to love at all though a lessor trait Rome possessed.It was not able to provide something that was not its by way of a conquered state.Slavery you see is without life with Spartacus leading not unto glory but unto a most certain death.Is this a film worth anything at all? There are more than one scene whereby the film put forward a sentiment that we are told is real and that even upon death Antoninus expresses a Love that is endearing upon the heart, forever does this abide.There is an attempt to provide a time ago.Antoninus at a fireside chat shows that bravery is more than a loud voice but of a tender heart as well.He tells of the longing to go home.He tells of when it was that he could go home.With this slave state, life for these hundreds upon thousands now had no home, and life was at a very effective juncture.This is not entirely seen however that was not to last as like the beginning the end was drawing near.This film possesses those worthwhile attributes and it is those worthwhile attributes that allow this film to achieve a bit of a victory in defeat.Rome was a soul less entity whose idea of imagination bore witness to a theft like the world even up to this very day had never scene.Rome pillaged the very world that it sought to enslave and not much more was her legacy outside of her call for Roman Law.This is a long day indeed.The lot of humanity that is told of hereby knew now that a long day had come. A time from a time ago was about to pass without knowledge of our way and our day with our father who art in heaven.It provides the telling of the beginning and the end to a slave revolt.It certainly was not ignored and at least for a time it wont be again.",9,2,4,4 May 2008
Training Day," A Parents Guide for 'Training Day' would help.
","The Motion Picture,'Training Day' should be placed on a do not see list.If at all possible the anti-social opinion put forth by this film should be ruled on as a un-worthy pleasure.The racial as well as contemptible conduct is extremely and grossly terrifying and if need be there is a terribly un-wholesome environment from which to judge as to the fitness level of such a motion picture.There is a 'R' rating that this film was given.The 'R' rating says the following, for 'brutal violence,pervasive language,drug content,nudity'.The 'R' seems to be less inclusive than this particular opinion would be satisfied by with perhaps politics of its own not providing something more telling than merely this particular 'R' rating can a test to.There is here put forth that where this motion picture is to be concerned,this film is a unworthy offerring as an entertainment vehicle.Parents as well as others are advised to read,'The Parents Guide for,Training Day'. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139654/parentalguide.There is present and this is merely to suggest as a final note to this opinion that there was a legitmate attempt to use the 'white boy'.The performer was in reality denied the right information as to the lines in a scene thereby providing for a veiled attempt to usurp authority.The target was in fact the 'white boy', which this kind of conduct has played into with a dangerous and ominous threat being provided for in a subversive underpining.I knew we as a public should be so much more careful about this because this is where the characters materialize in your own home. Let this be a threat to society as it is suggested it is in fact.This is an attempt to violate the rights of people and indeed this is such a subversive offer that it is Un-American.This is a warning and it is such a warning that this motion picture is a hands off warning.I rated this particular motion picture a '1' merely because of the violent purpose had against society by this film and its makers.I was not able to rate the film as a '0' because there is no capacity to enter a '0' into the ratings system.The dangerously unfriendly purpose had is what required a '1' because the subversive underpining was detected in time.This is in fact an unacceptable motion picture which should be further restricted with a revised rating of NC-17.",1,2,15,27 September 2008
Citizen Kane," A Drunk is in Charge:
","The motion picture Citizen Kane is most recently being marketed in a two disc special edition from Warner Brothers.The one disc is of course Citizen Kane and the second disc is entitled,The Battle over Citizen Kane-Special Features.I would recommend if you are in the market for the movie get the two disc special edition.It is important to understand why or at least how come this movie is so highly thought of,the second disc will assist the would be viewer in determining what kind of a problem are we up against.I originally saw Citizen Kane somewhere around 1970-1971 and I did feel it was interesting, however what about when you cant put your finger on it but its still there? Thats somewhat how this film was then and this time around I know why.The film was in part about Orson Welles own life however much is as I was aware of upon the initial viewing many years ago about William Randolph Hearst.This area is why I recommend the special edition.Hearst is the one who said you send me the prose and I'll provide the war,this is not meant to excite it is meant to warn you as to what your up against.Hearst was a very dangerous and even frightening character because according to the information that was provided he may have contributed to the assassination of President McKinley.This special disc will provide enough material so that you find that when we talk about undue influence,propaganda,areas like creating your own stories just to increase circulation and very unseemly attributes,there was know one more powerful nor influential then Hearst.The idea of what all this influence means was virtually invented by Hearst and this is what I mean when to suggest that what is in fact reality is not the well spring of a Democracy but of a horse of a different color and that is the death of a democracy.There are no dreams only the pedalling of a system and its undue influence and Hearst was an important part of a lie that we are even today suffering the effects of.There is good reason why this film is thought of so highly because like some other films they tend to comment on reality without knowing just how justice in this heart and this mind sees what it has attempted to accomplish.The idea of influence is perhaps like the power of suggestion it electrifies the night air,it maybe the impostor we are looking for,I kid you not.In fact this type of a discourse has provided a underpinning to some of the twentieth centuries most serious calamities.The idea of false importance is of a worthy psychological look see as well as the problem that we are drawn to now take a look at-This film is smart and if such considerations are somewhere even if only on the shelf somewhere it might be worth viewing.These items are of course not mentioned lightly and indeed there consequences do not go away simply,they must be dealt with because this is a problem.In a manner of speaking the call is yours as to the purport of this two disc edition and the films place in film history.P.S. Do not take the idea about 'rosebud' seriously,upon the initial viewing I seem to recall that rosebud was the name on his sled.This film is something of a satirical look at the life and times of William Randolph Hearst.",10,3,4,28 March 2004
Troy," Remember.......Remember ......
","The Motion Picture is something of a Delemma.There is nothing in its place in society if you will that should provide for anything more than an illusion which as far as illusions go well an illusion is just that,an illusion! That doesn't mean that there nothing worthy of mentioning but it may not as such be the kind of mention that is customarily associated with the writing of a review about the dilemma that such as this illusion provides for.There is more here than merely an illusion at work but something of a calculation as to the place that the motion picture,perhaps this motion picture but irregardless the motion picture and its marketing have benefited from.This particular motion picture entitled 'Troy' provides the backdrop of a time past with perhaps a few thousand years to account for, but nonetheless a time past appears as having been eclipsed in this motion picture entitled 'Troy'.The siren,like the voice echoes through out the film with some very dramatic if subtle themes being developed while the film goes on and a historic and valuable part of Ancient Greek History unfolds.It is suggested in the films credits that the backdrop of Homers,'The 'lliad' as well as 'The Odessey' are at the source of the story telling ability.'The Iliad' for arguments sake is merely about the last year or so in an event that for a time was thought never to have happened.The cause as to these doubts had as much to do with ability to place these events as it did in the events actually occurring.It further can be suggested that Homer was thought more to be a story teller than a teller of the stories of history.The general opinion was that Homer exaggerated events and this of course lent a inability to believe in the story in its entirety or even at all.The dilemma then resurfaces because one appears to be as unreliable as another and as yet we are but in the year 2007 while these events were said to have occurred sometime prior to AD.The film opens with a wide open landscape,beautiful virtually untouched beaches and a narration as to the end of time and the beginning of the timeless and eternal quest for immortality.This perhaps as best as it can be authenticated was a preoccupation of the then pagan(worshiping of many Gods-or perhaps no God at all,or no religion)Greek Society.It is worth mentioning that the motion picture attempts to tell the story of 'The Trojan War'.The attacks by the Greek Army was virulent with devastation and ruin accompanying the ultimate cost to Troy with its defeat.It is a very tragic tale of a verified youth,whose royal blood was no less kin to the 'King of Troy:King Prium',this youths name was Paris.It has been generally established that indeed this impetious young man made a conquest of the another rivals wife in whose name bore the burden of 'Helen of Sparta' and like the film states sparked this terrible conflict.Hector,the older brother to Paris was to far along the route back to Troy when he was advised by Paris that there was a guest on board which he was concerned about.This was to happen while they sailed for Troy when it was then revealed to Hector that his younger brother Paris had been unfaithful.This created one hell of a mess and the on board conversation between Hector and Paris was a useful if not portent of a disaster unfolding.Though this is mentioned after the fact, this unfaithful relationship was underway as the two countries which had been rivals more so than enemies,though enemies to be certain,now there was to be discord that added insult to injury as they(Helen and Paris) loved while the countries celebrated a peace.Truly this was a disaster!The approaching doom was sealed when she did not return immediately and a tremendous armada of ships and men,some 50,000 strong set sail for the beaches of 'Troy'.The Truth as to events about to unfold was that many heroes according to Greek Culture were to die including AJAX,Hector,Achilles,Paris.With the sacking of 'Troy' Achilles authored a kind of revenge by desecrating the Temple of Apollo,one of the many Gods that the Trojan people worshiped.They also killed un-armed Priests as they prayed as well as taking captive those that prayed.Achilles was thought of and even today he is considered the very mightiest of warriors and was blessed by the Gods.He was there greatest warrior with a select band of very skilled men in his personal elite force of mamodens.The film is authored by Heroes whose frames and fierceness are only seconded by there loyalty to there King and their country.The battle scenes are engaging and mightily told as camera work with computer animated graphics make a modest amount look like many many thousand,from men to ships.It is done well.The music is very good with a theme song that will echo if you will as the story unfolds,entitled 'Remember'.The Greeks of that day had rituals which were observed when there dead had to be removed from the battlefield.It is a moving moment a dramatic detail that there was more at stake here than merely the fighting of a battle.It was the honor,the duty of every Greek man to provide a witness unto Greece herself in his duty as a warrior.It was no joke it was for real and indeed this sacking of Troy was brutal stuff.With the tolling of the Bell from Troys watchtowers along the beach,they warned of the impending peril foretold now approaches with unmistakable certainty.The horizon filled with the promised armada with Achilles landing on the beach first.It was a big time fight and one which both morality and honor were a part of the taking of life.It is these themes that are interwoven into the very telling of the story of 'Troy'.",8,1,4,11 December 2007
Gettysburg," Before During and After !
","This was truly a watershed event in this nations history.The Battle of Gettysburg represents the end of the beginning and as well the beginning of the end for the confederate cause.The debacle was preceded by another first in the civil war which was like Gettysburg.The North was growing in strength,in numbers and in know how.This was illustrated at The Battle of Brandys Station.It is considered the largest cavalry engagement of the Civil War and it occurred late June 1863.It was J.E.B.Stuart Cavalry Corp that had been assigned the task of shielding Lee's army of Northern Virginia as it made its way across Maryland and on into PA.Stuarts Cavalry Corps first duty was to protect Lee's flank and as well it was also to deny the ability to see Lee corps at all.J.E.B.Stuarts Cavalry Corps did that at Brandies station,however it also provided proof that the confederacy was on the move and that Union Cavalry was gaining ground in its ability to go toe to toe with the Rebel and beat him on horseback.It was to prove to be a drawing even as Union forces gained a foothold.Gettysburg did not show that perhaps they should of.J.E.B.Stuart Cavalry Corp was caught of guard at Brandies Station however Gettysburg failed in another Stuart debacle when he lost a critical battle as he attempted to flank the Northern position on Seminary Ridge.There he was defeated with a series of reckless charges attributed to Brevet General George Armstrong Custers Michigan Brigade.Stuarts Corp of some 4500 was turned back by a force less than half the size of Stuarts Corp.It was a story that deserved to be told as here 'Long Hair' was brave,courageous even resourceful.Custers conduct was untold in this Motion Picture but it was as much a part of the landscape as it was about the battle of Gettysburg.It was such a critical accomplishment that it protected Meades Rear and did in its own right prove an invaluable part of the Unions ability to hold its ground.J.E.B.Stuarts Cavalary Corp was often thought to be Lee's eyes and ears,when Stuart was no where to be found as Heaths Corp engaged Buford, Lee was groping for intelligence and Stuart was not present.This was done well,even convincingly as the dramatic intent was convincingly portrayed.Lee indeed was playing for keeps and perhaps Gettyburg was it!His admonishment of Stuart was not without sentiment however the North had learned.The Motion Picture Gettysburg did show an historical perception that the north on that day,that day being July 1,1863 came into Gettysburg from the South and in fact the South came into Gettysburg from the North.Buford,s defense has long been held in high account as a superior rebel force was slowed to such a time that the retreat was a calculation to attain higher ground on the other side of Gettysburg.It was to paraphrase, a lesson in how to retreat.It is interesting to note that Lee's confederates when marching into the Gettysburg community as things were to progress,many had no shoes.It is here another belief of history that this battle in Gettysburg grew out of an attempt made by Southern forces to procure from the Gettysburg community,shoes.Worth mentioning is the contribution that General Longstreet provided while all the while arguing for a redeployment.This was excellent story telling ability that jived with history.This film by Ron Maxwell rates higher than merely a motion picture but a motion picture that jives with history.Little Round Top is an inspiring story,General Hancock is an inspiring story,so extreme was the need for hospitals to care for both the wounded and the dead that the hospitals place in Western culture was made permanent.It seems almost an endless task to assess the drama and effect this event and its accompnaying Civil War have provided this Nation and our culture that merely a film like Gettysburg may in fact be more of a Motion Picture than it can be a lesson in history.This is witnessed to the fact that there is much that is not included and as yet the 'Last Full Measure' has been permanetly put on the back burner.We have in this battle of Gettysburg the rudiments of a day of Thanksgiving.Please refer to Oct. 1863.I would watch this film again indeed perhaps even again.It was worth the many viewing as history became a dramatic account whereby we were all the while a participant in an event of July 1863.An excellent telling of the Battle of Gettysburg.",10,0,1,13 December 2008

Forrest Gump," You Never know what you get in a box of Cracker Jax
","Forrest Gump is not a very easy film to look at without really needing to move into depth and vision.The film seems not to allow for a capsule summary and personally it doesn't want to be characterized.The truth is like that in many ways because it stands for something that stands the test of time and perhaps thats what makes some of this going not particularly simple.Its difficult not to like this film and more so how we are looked at perhaps as a remnant of time.The early going for the parent was not so easy to understand because there was a lack of humility exhibited by gumps mother but gump was not brought up a certain way that would allow for a typical response and so we have an unusual storyline.Doctors can have that kind of sobering effect on developing youngsters,no one reading this can say otherwise because we all grew up.The bullying and clever positioning of scenes is not always enjoyable but it is a way that we are being poked fun at or begged to have a sense of humor.There would of long been a number of fights had that occurred when I was in those grades and indeed I think that here the picture starts to tell us something about bravery,honor,ingenuity,and good fortune.Forrest Gump can run like the wind.Clever,witty and it certainly does keep your interest.However its got to stop this is absolutely ridiculous and that when the story begins to go backward.I thought the anti-war protest scene was a great pitch for an everlasting value,it was unfortunate that the female had no more sense than most of those deals back then because what was represented in the heart of this very decent man was true love.Perhaps,perhaps,perhaps it is terribly moving his involvement with jinny.It would of hurt to have gotten all those letters back and so much so that in reality this relationship would not of matured.This is a complicated area because it is suggested that she was the victim of child abuse perhaps though not stated even maybe more so than just abuse.It is further suggested that that was the cause of jinnys proclivities as she wondered about the country side.It is even more involved than that and that she had no home life and only one parent and then not even that.We certainly have the idea here of two youngsters jinny and gump both of which do not share or know what it would be like to have both parents present in there upbringing.The girl is something of a wreck from the start as her idea of stardom in that bar scene was ridiculous.I personally don't have the time nor the room to really look at what it was that this movie attempted to say.Why would you have a naked broad on stage with a guitar singing how many roads does a man have to walk down before you call him a man,?If all roads don't lead to Rhome I wouldn't know ?This perhaps was a good way to showcase gump more so than other aspect of this film because the broad was in a dump and doing what so many of them do and what is that?I really don't know because it would not of occurred to me nor did it occur to gump that she was his one and only.The tragic idea here has to do with two essential aspects of love,importance and pleasure.The young girl continues to move away from a central point and away from true love.This is the nature of the rebellion in her and eventually she will discover that she has lost something very dear,even very close to her heart.It maybe her love of her parent or maybe her love for forrest gump,however that lost idea is going to fool her into beleiving in something that is not important nor is the pleasure that it provides of a lasting value.I cant provide all that is condoned with its place but it isn't friendly and that is where forrest gump shows the audience what is more important and that is a love of abiding faith so deep as to be though over history.The placement of this picture suggests that there is no place like home,that being greenbaugh,alabama and quite frankly I agree.The suggestion is very appropriate and perhaps well placed.I think Forrest Gump was a bit over simplified as no one could be that stupid or could he.I think the scenes in college are about as enjoyable as college gets and his military service exemplary.He was trained very well and did this nation a service by representing the USA as one of its ping pong ambassadors to china.There is so much that Iam not going to go much father due in principal that unless you cant see it Gump is the right man.He has a gift and it is about to pay off.This really doesn't answer what everyone else is doing or what else may in fact be going on but the unbelievable happens Apple Computer.I think thats a smile and so was his road running.The feather theme by Alan Silvestri is worth mentioning as a beautiful piece of music.Like I said this is not a simple film nor is it exactly what it appears either.",10,0,3,5 November 2004
Independence Day," The Jolly Rogger
","The Motion Picture Independence Day was a film that wanted to be liked so badly that it bordered on absurdity,however as a film it possessed enough air head possibilities to make it the highest grossing film for the year 1996.This blockbuster film was not so much a film about aliens and the possibility of life existing elsewhere other than the planet earth but about what would occur if indeed these creatures were more advanced and could time travel and almost the whole family show up on the Fourth of July.I was one of the many persons who learning of the extreme blockbuster status that this movie gathered in the theaters went to see what it was about.There is perhaps good reason why reviewsnever get written and indeed I had to think about this blockbuster film to decide if it was worth writing a review.Iam still not so certain that it is worth much of a say outside of the near hysterical non-sense that we get bowled over by,sufficient enough to pick our pockets in exchange for a afternoon at the movies.One of the by products of this relatively new advent of the whole community writing a review about these pictures is that we are encouraged to participate in the activities and become if you will a contributor to its well being.Iam not so certain that such contributions are worthwhile and indeed it is not even the participation which is unwholesome but the fact that there is a very real underpinning to all this that borders on a shameful illusion and it only provides for a lie that gets its way.Some of the problem to judging this film like the motion picture itself, is the value that it provides for,which is not only suggestive but as well unsupported.The boastful goings on of the film are showy and indicate a look at me mentality,however that not withstanding,it isn't where the fault is,it is in the assumption that we all care and that everyone from all around the world is paying attention to the Americans.The undesirable prospect is if that be true then there is reason why this film is so worldly and that is because it wants to be certain that it is noticed and indeed viewed by as many as can be gotten into the theaters.The Gross Figures indicate somewhere around 340 million dollars,second to none for the year.There is an illustration provided as to this films coercive abilities in the two columns along the side of the page.There is a goofs column and a factual/details column and much more.I have never seen so many different errors,details,and goofs at all and yet it sold like a barn on fire.The leveling off is this,the picture provided for a unreasonable assumption that in a manner of speaking was awarded for the ability to do so in its special effects.It does this by creating an idea of importance that some 70 different news broadcasts were used as a means to coerce public opinion,and that if you will is something like a picture within a picture The definition as to the cause effect of the press core and its influence is said to be the equivalent of the event occurring even as suggested only on a television screen.The real point is just how much does so much influence,really influence our daily lives.What in fact is reality?Were paying for it,we certainly have the right to know.This consequence due to non-sense is further highlighted with a series of other questions.The picture being a unsupported position can then be asked what is being encouraged if the premise as to the film is ridiculous? For one thing boasting and showing off and for another,power over another is assumed.That is both blatant in its underpinning as well as seductive.The seduction is provided in the scene where the female who is a exotic dancer is preparing to marry Capt.Hillard.She does a seductive zip my dress up with her angel,who is no more than maybe 9 or 10 years old.I think that that kind of suggestion is inappropriate even bordering on improper.Little boys like Little girls are innocent and though it is suggested that the girls grow up faster then boys,it is the boys who are rebellious. That scene is mean as it is suggestive and even provocative because parents should know better and when they do not provide for the child some moral fiber as to conduct they allow for a fast lane idea which allows a deviate basis as to conduct.Though there is more to suggest all I can say that deviant conduct is not about sexual proclivities it is about crime and a problem in society,all stemming from the child's upbringing.This is not a simple idea and neither is what this film is selling.Hollywood is not such that we should know these back-lots and warehouses lest we stumble upon the next academy award. The special edition provided for the actor Harvey Fierstien making like a Pink Flamingo and planting one on Jeff Goldblum,to everyones surprise.Its not too cool and Iam glad it wasn't the special edition that aired in the theaters.It is difficult to judge performance however the main stay of the film seemed to have actors playing parts but that was the jest of it-It was not much more than that and though this may not mean anything it always seemed that when suggestions were finally set in motion they were objected to inappropriately and out of time.There is a disjointed idea about importance,honesty and this picture and never the twain shall meet.Iam not kidding this really is a very stupid film.The timing and appropriateness of certain comments seemed to be emphasized when the aliens are closing in on closing us out and then we learn that we knew all about them.I don't know but things just had a hard time adding up-the aforementioned columns with the errors and details perhaps will shed some light on all the problems this film exhibited.",7,0,1,10 January 2005
Zulu," Above and Beyond the Call of Duty
","A motion picture is indeed a very strange phenomena,with more tricks and slights of every sort that it is unworthy as a character witness.The difficulty with this particular motion picture is that it provides for the appearance of the Zulu tribe in its natural ability allowing a western culture to learn how this horde of warriors once annihilated a British column of some 1200 plus British soldiers.In the opening moments to this film we are greeted with a ritualistic dance whereby,Zulu Men and Women celebrate there coming mass marriage however this is done in a very natural fashion and though I was but a 15 year old I even wonder now if indeed this was fit for children to watch.It is one of the dramatic moments when there is news as to the annihilation and Jack Hawkins who plays a Missionary with his Daughter played by Ula Jacobsson are participating as respectable guests might, this celebration of the coming marriage of all these Zulu Warriors.They leave the Zulu camp when a messenger brings news of the outcome and these servants of the will of God doubt the resolve of there efforts to convert the Zulu king to a Christian belief along with his entire tribe.The English historically were in actuality spoiling for a fight with the Zulu's and when the annihilation occurred it was poor judgment and terrible overconfidence that were real ingredients in the disaster.This all seems to play into the build up of this very brave even heroic stand taken by some 100 plus British soldiers and the mission at Rorke's Drift.The Zulu's with more than 4,000 warriors were now en-route to wipe-out whatever English soldiers were at Rorke's Drift.This is the story of that stand which provides for the eloquent statement that since the Advent of the Victoria's Cross for Bravery beyond the call of Duty some 10 were awarded here in this particular action which occurred in January 1879.If there is a mention as to performance it would seem that if there was anything not serious enough prior to the arrival of the Zulu's it was dashed pretty well as the entire post fought for its very life.The characterization by Nigel Green I personally thought was exemplary as the officer portrayed was as skilled with a bayonet as he was in his knowledge of what it meant to be an English officer in 1879.I watched this character actor in Khartoum as well and though much less a role he was still terribly skilled as a subject of Her Majesty the Queen of England.It was this performance in general that caught my attention,however this was not about individual performances this was about the survival of the mission at Rorke's Drift and the 100 plus British soldiers who defended it.The Zulu's attacked however the English quickly learned how many of there comrades had perished and it was in watching how some of there own had as well, by not taking the enemy seriously and in so doing exposing themselves to peril and of course dying as a result.They closed ranks with greater and greater precision and with valor fought off a most certain death.The battles scenes are engrossing and much of the picture provides for such compelling information that indeed you have here a very interesting film.It is interesting enough that it will hold your attention perhaps even from start to finish.One final note as to this film.It was the music of John Barry that had for many years stayed with me long after I had all but forgotten the film.It was the reason why I today possess a copy by way of a DVD of Zulu but as well possess a dedicated soundtrack of the music of John Barry.",7,2,6,6 February 2006
Saving Private Ryan," From Sea To Shining Sea
","To many the story of Saving Private Ryan starts with the landings at Normandy and the incredibly realistic depiction of D-Day June 6,1944,however there is first the subtle and unexpected deliverance of James Ryan to the headstone of Captain John Miller whereby the story is told of a time past when something of what we love was lost forever.The emotional place where this very fine movie goes is to our ability here today to talk to each other as though this was merely a motion picture and not the roll call for our honored dead.Though we are through James Ryans eyes taken back to when Captain Millers company is approaching the beach head at Omaha in one of those Higgins boats we are drawn into perhaps one of the most incredible movie scenes ever done.It is almost to terrible to elaborate,however thats the way it is.I do not feel this was meant to be an anti-war theme however if you want to know what it was like or perhaps what it might be like this is a good film to watch.This is a no-holds barred look at that action.For the record,this landing zone was called Omaha,and I believe it was the most difficult of the 5 landing zones.However we did establish a beach head and as the dates of history will show within 1 year we were to meet with our Allies in Berlin.This is a unforgettable war movie that should not be missed.I will express only a reservation about some of the attempts at a protest position against war.The inability to properly put a prisoner of war permanently out of the action was not I believe worthy and when that big bad Nazi did that deed to kill one of our guys and was not killed as a result was cowardice under action.I think that was pretty bad and in fact cost us because he could of engaged the enemy before the enemy even went any where near the staircase.Some of the emotional purges seem very much over the top but it seems to provide a very convincing ability to convey the deadly seriousness of what we were involved in,when a voice says to Captain Miller,'thats quite a view,'and Miller says 'yes it is,'That is when we get a view of what is forever lost,a sacrifice which on the field at Gettysburg,Pa Abraham Lincoln said that these honored dead should not have died in vain but gave there full measure so that we may increase our devotion and know a new beginning in defense of the republic.The banter is hard to predict but perhaps that was then this is now,however the final battle scene is hard to handle that was a very demanding challenge and boy did things heat up.Excellent war time footing and you dont loose concentration.I actually thought that If I could we would want God to know that we love each other for the bravery,honor,and life that we are being asked to provide so this Private James Ryan might know a future,and his decendents as well.If you had paid attention Jim Ryans family was there, children and all.A job well done Captain Miller,Thank You.To you Rangers of the Omaha Landings,my heart.",10,1,2,13 March 2004
Black Hawk Down," Code Name-'Irene'
","The Movie,'Black Hawk Down' is an excellent story of what it means to come to the aid of civilization.I certainly as a viewer and even as a reviewer were slow to respond to the impression that this story told of on the silver screen.This recommendation is done because there is territory that is covered, that involves not only the truth but the welfare of civilization.It is a film that unlike some films when they open,you are immediately struck by the moment.Perhaps like Saving Private Ryan with the landings that were to occur in minutes on the beaches of Normandy,France.Saving Private Ryan though looks back through the eyes of Ryan.A son who because of the efforts made on his behalf through Captain Millers company was able to 'earn this'and indeed our introduction to the story of Saving Private Ryan is a powerful testament to the sacrifice offered in exchange for the life saved.Even now though not the reason for this review the powerful underpinning to Saving Private Ryan makes it a very memorable film,one which equates with great,A truly exemplary motion picture.However we have here a film that is about an event that took place in 1993 and it concerned the peoples of Somalia.This film opens on a subtle,almost eerie note with dark gray colors with music that won an academy award.The dramatic event begins ever so slowly almost to draw you in,perhaps even as a curiosity.To be certain we are looking at the dead and how the mass deaths were part of the picture of whatever life there was left.It invites an almost shocking perception as to the scale that this story tells off.We are told through the sayings of Plato that only the dead see the end to war and we watch how mass starvation due to the wars of clans and the like have provided the grounds for a loss of life that is described as Biblical in proportion.The numbers offered are said to exceed 300,000 dead due to starvation and counting.So dire were the needs of the Somalis that the World Community got wind of the disaster and in response to a terribly inhumane state, the UN with the full cooperation of our nation(USA)sent in front line U.S.Marines,some twenty thousand strong to restore order and re-establish a food line to assist in an attempt to save a future here too.We come to expect great things from our greatest and we got what we wanted as historically it will indicate that order was restored and food as well as supplies were finding there way to the population.However,the front line force was to be replaced soon and very capable units involving US Army Rangers as well as Delta Force commandos were on the ground in Somalia with designs to sever the head of the serpent by denying it some of its functioning pieces.Gun dealers,political as well military personnel are rounded up in an attempt to limit the effect of Aideeds faction.The claim as to the state of affairs that provided for the calls for help were an illustration of a failure of a governing body to be responsible and responsive to the many that they had authority over.This failure was and is a very present circumstance that cannot endure permanently and society or civilization will die as a result.However,this film does not as a rule look at the film as a political film it does though attempt to establish some methods as to how to deal with the events that we were watching unfold.The UN position was to do all we could without getting ourselves involved in what was considered somewhat of a civil war.We watch aid-ides militia shoot unarmed civilians and as the film takes us into Mogadishu,we learn that this is one of the most dangerous cities in all the world.The streets have vendors selling guns,which are AK47s with so many different small arms that you would probably equate its place likened to selling umbrellas,Belts,or neck ties.It is that pervasive and indeed that eerie feeling felt at the start of the film does not go away.This is a very dangerous community and not at all shy about it.The political position has an effect on just how capable a presence we wish to provide when there are final plans drawn up under the code name'Irene' to move into the heart of what is considered very unfriendly territory and kidnap or capture these important pieces in Aideeds organization.The political climate suggested a low profile would be more fitting our place in the eyes of the world,so that a request for some of our special weaponry was disallowed.It may have contributed to the fact that we had to engage the enemy at all,however that withstanding our combat loses were to be nearly 19 dead and 71 wounded with the enemy having lost some 1,000.00 dead and wounded.The battle scenes don't end and there is a continuous involvement of the fight until the nighttime when though the militia may of thought it was there time when in fact they were dealt a blow through our helicopter gunships that by day light things were a-bit more peaceful.This is a very warrior type of picture,where our men in uniform provided outstanding commitment to peace and a unequivocal ability to gain that objective.In a final note this is a excellent film worth seeing more than once plus its not winning more academy awards than just two may have had something to do with timing more than anything else because this film is that good.The two categories in which it won were Best Film Editing and Best Sound.This film is worth the Soundtrack by its self,it is as good as it gets worth many many a listen.Highly recommended and rates equal footing with the very best in war time films.",10,5,9,24 December 2004
Enemy at the Gates," A Long Days Journey Into Night
","I felt that with this motion picture a difficult ability was made more difficult.There is no time perhaps even unto mans history when such battles were fought as was the days that engulfed the world in World War II.The Battles at Stalingrad and then Kursk would for those interested mark drama so deadly,the cost in life so extreme that it is cause to look again at the passing of time with but a steadfast eye.It is a serious affront to our place in matters of the world and as compelling as any death the likes of which have no equal lest there be the tolling of the bells with the onset of the 'Black Death'.It is a very difficult position in its entirety to allow all the days to be as these days whereby millions of people were removed from the earth and time merely stood still as there was no day to be tomorrow for today was enough.The tragedy was not to be extended it was to be protracted in an end time concern.The Red Army was triumphant though such triumphs should be warned against when looked at more closely because there was nothing its equal in the record of mans place in this world and though it is an expense, the cost was a cost that turned the tide of events of World War II.When Germany's 6th Army was defeated it was representative of the rolling back of the tide with the battle of Kursk looking like a serious attempt to merely establish a holding position.It was not to be for the German 6th Army was not to stop back pedaling perhaps it can be suggested until the days of this war were to be done.Though it is suggested by these comments that the German 6th Army was retreating it is a note to be certain that the retreating Army did not always look like a retreating Army.Those whose interests have ever eclipsed the War between the States here in the America's will know that with Robert E. Lee at the helm.Confederate forces provided for General Grant more than a handful of engagements that were so deadly that they had eclipsed a much more deadly engagement merely days before.It was during the days that followed The Battle of Gettyburg a retreating Robert E.Lee exacted a cost that though dramatic and even victorious was to serve notice as to those who followed for this was war.Indeed it was something from Abraham Lincoln which though somewhat shocked at the toll of these engagements was to say,'Grant Fights'.The northern industrial might was a terribly important piece in determining the final outcome and indeed there was a real step up for the Russian Red Army that was supplied with so much that it just got bigger and bigger much like the Army of the Potamac under General Grant.Critical and dramatic were these events and one might suggest not unlike the other.This particular account in Enemy At The Gates is merely some Hollywood offerring which by no means allows us to know much of anything and as well everything sort of looks like everything else which is something that does not make anymore anything better.There is historical information that the account of the Russian defense at Stalingrad did benefit more than merely one expert sniper in Vasili Zeitsev,it benefited from an entire account as Russian sharpshooters were eating the Germans alive.Though Zeitsev is championed in this motion picture there were others whose accomplishments were even more so as there numbers were greater in confirmed enemy kills.There is mention of a film called 'War of the Rats' whereby this very sewer to sewer,building to building,pipeline to pipeline served to undermine the German position and was instrumental in the German High Commands Decision to send for one of its very best Sharpshooters in a Major Konig.This particular film is useful at least for a time with this clever battle of wits that both sides waged with the arrival of Konig.If there was a moment whereby I judged this film it was in the moment of victory over a predator in this Major Konig as portrayed in the picture.I watched closely for an inability to know and was satisfied that indeed with a victory in hand there was no doubt in its execution.There is a real disadvantage that the public in General are victims of and some of this victimization is as a result of not knowing the truth nor possessing the will to know better than merely this kind of offerring.One of the areas not dealt with in a much the same way however the Russians had an expert Spy ring called Lucy which was so well informed that long before something was to happen they,the Russians were to be ready.It was in an account of the Battle of Kursk where some of these hitherto unknown strengths possessed by the Russians became evident.This film is somewhat reticent to discuss these areas and indeed as suggested this maybe merely an entertainment vehicle which I wish could find entertainment elsewhere.Hollywood belongs not on the field of the dead nor should such be made as to make money in performing as if to be something that this is not.This is not the real thing and it should not no not ever thought to be the real thing.It is thought that there was all this that occurred however there is in this film much exxageration with story telling more important than the story of The Russian Sniper Division so effective in disrupting German interests at Stalingrad that it may of in fact altered history.If this film did anything it forced me to do some research and it is this research that made this A Long Days Journey into Night.",8,1,3,14 June 2008
The Green Mile," The Illusion of the Silver Screen
","The Green Mile is on the surface a film by which young and younger audiences will share a common like for and indeed they will all provide the idea that is not in fact believed in.The Green Mile is a cold calculating imposition as to the state and its mandate to execute these individual's whom it has deemed worthy of dying for there crimes against society.There is also no redeeming quality in there sentencing as both the law as well as the state provide and in fact by virtue of the film itself deny the existence of a supra-natural creator.There is no hope in this film,only the death that it solemnly moves toward.There is a terrible mistake that audiences make when they see a film like this and that is to judge it as to society and the system which rules as possessing any moral belief in God or even of Salvation.This film is a very clear predetermined denial of the existence of Miracles and as well that a God in Heaven exists,or has ever existed.The inability of the films underpinning to provide a belief in the innocence of the character named Coffe-is so cold and even bastardly that this is thought to be the law when in fact it represents the getting of ones way and further it represents through the conduct of its officials,from rookie cop to prison warden the desire to maintain the status quo.The revelation late into the film of the real killers identity should of provided at least some effort to see that an innocent man does not die for a crime that he did not commit.One of the reasons that he did go to the electric chair was because he was the one they chose and come hell or high water he's the one there going to fry.The idea that he fell out of the sky as like a patsy was made very evident by the attorney who represented him.What suggested is that when the law says its got its man it means it.If the viewer wishes to include some ideas about racism I too will not ignore it because there are simply to many stories about the perils of this life not to listen to the evidence.However this is not the end to this story about the world we live in,it provides only the sure thing that any who find there way to death row will most surely die.This film provides a problem and that we as a culture live in a world that is ruled over by a system as well run by Laws and the people it employs to enforce those laws.There are a couple of areas that are worth mentioning,it is this reviewers opinion that one of the attractions of the film is of the emotional content which is exemplified by the miracles witnessed by these officials.The Hanks ordeal is real enough however it is the Wardens wife who believes and in fact provides a witness that is indeed a very worthy chapter in this movie presentation.The makers of this film were very conscious of appearances where we see the wife upon Coffey entrance into her room and the subtle attempts to alter her appearance without changing the scene.The not spoken of up to this point is Mr. Jingles and though this may in fact provide for amusement it is deadly serious.This film made certain that it was not stated out right lest it be against the law however even as of just a couple of days ago-appearing in the New York Times(this day being-Dec.12,2004)there was a graph of the percentage of DNA that is possessed by other species not being human.The mouse then and even now is recognised as having the highest percent of DNA seen to be exactly the same as the human being,that being 55%.What does that mean?it provides for the fact that there is no belief in the existence of Devine Creation and that the human kind literally evolves from the likes of a lower order of life.This film is more deadly then a bullet because its underpinnings are understated and not immediately perceived by there audience.The introduction to the film and as well the end to the film are in fact the answers and seem at first incongruent with the telling of this tale.What answers-The impossible idea of the existence of Mr.Jingles just so in that cabinet-it is so convenient not to be taken seriously and though the old guy is older its not a worthy thought of him being as old as he suggests.If I remember he suggests something in the hundreds and so on,however it to me is not to be believed in and it would seem that in fact there is an admission of actually trying to steal the thunder of Gods Mercy through the carrying out of the orders to execute Coffe.These are unjust and unfriendly neighbors and never the Twain shall meet.What we are asked as of all things to believe in, is Christian in its precept and yet does nothing to assuaged the heart of the human kind as to the very deadly and dangerous purpose had by this overseer as well by its system.When you play with reality this is the kind of review you get and I promise you there is a-lot more where this came from.This film is about stealing the life from the heart of the human kind and though not being of itself particularly inspiring it is also provides for a look see as to what was being stolen if not the heart of the matter and that might be the opportunity to do so-I think we are in fact looking at the profit motive and how deadly serious it is with reality in tow to get its way-This is not recommended viewing and in fact is a UN-American film.",6,1,2,12 December 2004
Inception," What kind of an accomplishment is it to be a born liar ?
","Inception is a lie and like all legitmate hollywoods irregardless of who is doing what to whom there is only the technology that allows this hysterical calculator(that is all this film represents) in this motion picture to perhaps make money.There seems not much more to suggest and that would be if this film made money,? Well did it ? This is what is a most unusual point to all this,and that would be if this particular film did not make money what else is this film doing if in fact it did not make money? What is required to know better or perhaps to truly know well what the viewer is looking at when as a viewer,the viewer as it were watches the motion picture 'Inception'.There is as well another consideration and that is if in fact the very participation in the watching of any motion picture is such an experience as to be a unwholesome experience. I believe it is that(unwholesome) and even more so provides for a disguise so to mislead any who might be drawn for what ever reason to watch such a film or for that matter to watch such are the films of Hollywood,California.There is no degree of involvement in the making of this film that is in fact authentic and as illegitimate that that might sound like it is an illegal search and seizure which allows a thief to be masqueraded as the man with the candy.This film is not new nor is this film what it appears as is as well.The result when viewing such a film is that there is no time that is real nor is there a place as to any particular event is concerned and if that isn't enough there is no definition as to not if there is a capacity to dream but how do we provide the ability to interject another ability that could pass as a dream.This is the handiwork of a masquerade with any here who believe believe not in this motion picture as there is no dreaming there is only the ability to transmit the stimulus with the image that is what masquerades as a 'dream'.It is as well imposed upon the body of the human race so to provide a unmistakable influence.The influence as the film provides such a witness has a goal of influence pure and simple this film is merely more of the same as the same has meant since as it were its inception.It is its invention that is at the source of this worlds ability to influence anything with merely more of the same being all that the viewer will ever be looking at.The inventor as well as the inventors many inventions are all patented and do it is believed remain so.There were some 700 separate inventions with which this unwholesome day in this world occurred when one Nicola Tesla discovered how to bind energy across wide open space many many miles from nowhere including even deepest darkest space.This is the field of regard it is as well the ability to network with many disparaging elements so to influence even say Adolf Hitler(I kid you not).Though 1920 is the year of radio's invention and 1921 the year Berlin radio started to broadcast it was a good time before this point in time that Tesla's inventions and subsequent patents were in place.The better premise would be to know through Tesla's own words as to what capacity does what he invented provide and without to much trouble Tesla's's own misgivings provide for the very problem of being under the influence of a lie.Though this lie was not meant to interfere with the human race that is exactly what has occurred.The money men of Teslas's own day are at the root cause as to the necessity to influence anything outside of an antenna.They remain as perhaps a cog in the wheel that very nearly saw to its conclusion not to long ago.This wasn't Tesla's design this was there influence on his attempt to bind energy that it was not to be unless of course they could extract a measure if you will of revenge upon humanity.This is the masquerade that there is a profit motive in this foreign power as well as an aggression not to be deterred in its inability to be regulated properly.This is an imperfect science which has meted out suffering through this field of regard.(network field)It is this thief in the night and it is as well the exploiter of human flesh that this film is providing the viewer with.This is what this film is up to and it has been such since it inception.",4,7,10,9 January 2011

","The motion picture,'The Truman Show' is not so much an interest but a shock.The picture is not only a discredit but such a fallacious argument as to set back the human race some 150 years.The reference to 150 years was to refer to a time when there was a Civil War in what was then the United States against the Confederate States of America.The conflict was to cause the abolishment of slavery as an exercise in any state right issue whereby a human being was denied the right to life,liberty and the pursuit to happiness.The Truman Show is a latter day attempt to undermine the very foundations of that which there was given the last full measure so that we might enjoy a new birth of freedom.A paraphrase taken from the Gettysburg Address when spoken in July 1863 by then President Abraham Lincoln.There is in fact such an arrogant position had by this film that we might be said to enter into a new world order whereby a state is indeed introduced as a Godless Overseer and right holder to the human being.There is such an inbred contempt for Trevor Burbank who is the victim of this raid of the heart that a story told by Civil War historian Shelby Foote,told of a slave who was the property of an over seer on a Virginia Plantation.The slave managed to escape and won his freedom by moving stealthily through the underground railroad to a community North of the Confederate territory.He was, as fate would have it,to join union forces and at a time later was to be part of a Union move against the South whereby he would come directly across the very land whereby he was once a slave.The story told of the very deliberate seeking out and killing of the overseer with whom he was in slaved to.If this be worth anything it would be that Trevor Burbank should not only seek out and kill Christoph but every person directly associated with the broadcast.This is more than a mere crime this is slavery.The degree to which the ways of this world have parted is that we hardly recognize ourselves because with the passing of time came the advent of telecommunications and the conceit of another form though in fact it was to be the same old story yet in another form.That is what we are in fact looking out in this,'The Truman Burbank' Show.It is a very real attempt to thumb there noses at the foundations of a Democracy and flaunt their victimization of one Truman Burbank.The characterization of all those around the life of Truman Burbank share not common ground to such an extent that all of life seems merely to be lacking in color and even back bone,such is the offense!This coldly impersonal affront even onto decency is so vile as to be culpable and worthy to die as many times as necessary so as to rid the world of this malady once and for all.Christof should be sought out as stealthily as the story told of the former slave noted above and killed,because he is a Godless Monster.This order should be done with due diligence and with prejudice aforethought so that all associated with this event should see the end of their days on this Earth.There is nothing timid in this attempt to silence a heart beat and there should not be anything timid in its roar back as well.Let the human heart roar back at the attempt upon its place here as this system is as in human as it is a new world order.There is nothing here but a discredit and it is nothing but a discredit that is represented but this attempt upon our place in this world.Though we are in fact looking at a Motion Picture,the entertainment vehicle that it represents is not entertaining at all but in fact represents a hatred for honesty,for nature and for love.This film is an un-natural affront to entertainment and goes beyond mere viewing pleasure to a virtual contempt for civilization.This film is in fact a very violent attack upon life and can be construed as a promise of what maybe coming to a theater near you.You as a theater going public are warned of the propensity to pooh pooh this hatred and dismiss it without the right of way being taken back.The inability to right the wrong breaches the very cloth so sacred in our devotion to duty,honor and fidelity.There is present a matter of life and death with only judgement to wish for in the passing of the days.The end time is now upon this world and it is indeed a time to judge those who have sought to judge us.Let this be a prophecy foretold!",6,0,6,11 November 2007
The Matrix," Under The Yoke of a New World Order!
","The Motion Picture 'The Matrix' perhaps should be spelled matrice because that is what this film is using to tell the story of one Thomas Anderson(played by Keanu Reeves) who works for a top software computing company.It seems early into 'The Matrix' Thomas Anderson has two lives,one as already stated with the added comment that he helps his land lady take out the garbage and the other life is involved with computing and the internet whereby Thomas Anderson goes by the hacker alias 'Neo'and is guilty of committing about as many crimes as there are on computing and the internet.The definition of a Matrix is a switch which is a device 'that allows multiple channels connected via serial interfaces to connect under operator control to designated remote or local analog circuits.'It is while at his computer keyboard on a given evening that Neo is contacted directly by way of his own personal computer.How this is in fact accomplished is never clear however it is made even more implausible as Neo is not even on the computing network legally as his hacking proclivities would stand more a chance of being discovered.Yet that is exactly what occurs though that discovery is arranged by a notorious individual in Morpheus(played by Laurence Fishburne) with stalwart and even inspirational keyboardest in Trinity.Trinity wishes to meet with Neo and it is Trinity who has the capacity real or otherwise to write to the construct with an ability to actually break into a virtually invisible and undetectable space and land in Neo's lap.This occurs at a point in time when a knock occurs at his apartment door with a deal about to go down which though innocuous is not about drugs per se though drugs do enter into the general conversation(it is the only way to fly) it is about a specially written or/either stolen piece of computer data(on disk)and is purchased for some $2,000.00.Neo it would seem is living up to his name and indeed even by todays standards that is a talent only a few perhaps have the ability to achieve.Neo is a hacker who when a moment ago prior to the arrival of the these persons he was informed by way of his computer to follow the White Rabbit.A female who is partnered with the purchaser of the computer disk shows her shoulder to Neo to only expose a tattoo of a white rabbit and due to this coincidence he decides to go out though he has work the following morning.He somehow meets Trinity and it is here that it is discovered that Trinity is a girl and indeed Trinity is played by Carrie-Ann Moss.She warns him that they are looking for you and Neo asks who is.The film provides a cardboard characteristic perhaps more the equal to an animated construct as an air of a constructed set is bally-hooed with most of the picture being given imaginative as well as staid staging that provide for an effect as a construct which may actually be required as part of the purport of this film.The message however is that Thomas Anderson is about to jump ship permanently and bare the hacker alias Neo for the rest of time.The film leaves no doubt as to how all of this is to transpire with the matrix as well as telecommunications being made to be the transporter of the very physical presence that the film is named after.The real problem that this film will not shy away from,is that there is in the construct a reported illusion to an authority that is not real but artificial and indeed the film proceeds to be transported through telephone lines while evolving to a crusade to free themselves from the arrival of an artificially constructed cyborg entity,'Agents'.The agents are in fact hardwired to the construct and represent the gatekeeper ideology.They guard all the gates.It is not new territory,this territory as to telecommunications and though not new it is as well not new to be concerned with an artificial intelligence as the evolution of the computer has been for many years concerned with these very areas.The arrival though as to the claim of actual Agents(lead Agent played by Hugo Weaving)whereby they materialize as if residing or embedded in a matrix only environment for purposes of enforcement using the bodies of the citizenry is to underscore something unusual.The film provides for something as to the truth and the admission that there exists the real presence of an overseer whose authority is unmitigated by circumstance and whose power will not relent.We are in effect under the yoke of a tyrant and the communications of the 20th century has given witness to this rise of a foreign power as well as an artificial intelligence.They are in fact the same thing and we don't have to wait one hundred years as it is here now and has been here for at least some 50 to perhaps 75 years.It is well to understand that behavior has mass market appeal with films providing a virtual backyard to convey as films such as these do.The mass market appeal is likened to a cash register for what is more powerful than to control the wealth of the world,it would be to have power over it.The very clear and precise arguments as to abuse with power over others continually creeps into the picture time and time again allowing for an inability to get out from under the treachery of an overseer.It is this challenge that eventually materializes into the films most engaging scenes as Morpheus,Neo,Trinity all weigh in against the construct with real world rock-em-sock-em fight scenes.Though this is but something of an abbreviation,the climax as to the Matrix is worthy of mention as a kiss is well earned and if true love ever had a chance it won this one hands down.I've watched this more than once to learn as much about the construct as to learn about the film.",9,0,4,13 May 2007
Thirteen Days," The Cuban Missile Crisis:A Time of Great Danger
","I have had the opportunity to read many of the comments expressed as to the merits of the film,The Thirteen Days and I wondered how many whose comments appear here were in this world when the Soviet Union attempted to install medium and long range missiles in Cuba?  This film was one of the few movies that I actually went to see,when it was initially released and to this day it remains one of the few movies I will watch on Digital Versatile Disk more than once.When I exited the theater upon seeing this film I was asked by a women as to the film and I mentioned that it brought back a time when even my parents were still in this world. It was not so easy to understand that my mother and father loved this nation and its president and we as a people were made very much aware of the impending crisis that that attempt caused to occur.It also prompted me to tell this women I also remembered the assassination because then too a dramatic event had occurred that caused all to take notice and to pause as we were to lose a president.I was a young boy at the time and both events provided for an indelible impression.As to this very capable movie,it provides a very real appearance of we are there.I believe it is a worthy movie going experience and I recommend it.It is a very well done film,gripping tension,ever ending, unfolding drama.It was a moral buoy to hear the voice of John F. Kennedy in the later part of the film as a great president talked again.I rated this film a 10 as in excellent.",10,0,1,25 March 2004
300," My King ! Look
","There are many who pretend and then there are many who pretend.This film was viewed by me perhaps as many as 7 times within 6 weeks and even perhaps viewed more often than stated though it is even now still very viewable.I watched this film that often,as both Ancient Greek History as well as the attention these many reviews engendered required it.It is almost unusual to suggest that it was not this movie that made this worth watching but the defense of thermopylae that did.I did some research and even more so to learn that though this very emotional and power packed plea of the defense of Themopylae was a truly inspiring story.Its amazing underpinning lived on, as its king,King Leonidas said, 'Go Tell the Spartans what happened here'.It was more than a mere battle cry but a call from the heart of a King in King Leonidas to all of Greece to prepare for battle.This defense and its heroes provided for the kind of ferocious fighting that was to exemplify the ultimate victory that was to finally come when Xerses was defeated by a Greek Army force outside of Athens.This film had that much going for it and that its history was one of the more inspiring moments in all of military annals as well as the annals of the history of the world.What was to occur months and for a time to come, from that time on, was a series of small to very large engagements in which if there was death to its defenders it was committed with certainty as to glory.No defense was given without the taken of the life of the slave army of Persia.It should be further stated that this was not the only major battle that was to occur whereby the outcome was as the result of secret passage accessed by Xerses forces.There is only the echo,'Go tell the Spartans'This film became more and more a film to know, its subject matter required a better and better understanding as it did become both a demand of history and of the value of this particular motion picture.It would seem that the history cannot be denied and it is history that has made this film worth watching all these times and will allow for the watching of this film again.The 300 is characterized by excellent story telling,a most certain leader in the portrayal of King Leonidas and a demand to be up to the challenge that all freedom loving peoples should be aware of that 'free men stood up against a tyrant'It is in these sentiments that this film provides its most enduring quality.It is raw and it is present and neither will it fade away.This is a permanent quality,a everlasting voice unto all of time to, 'Go Tell The Spartans'This is not only an emotional appeal it is as well an inspirng story as to the very basic underpinning to the word which translated from the Greek means Democracia.This is the kind of interest that this film engendered as its place however humble is made glorious with and because of its pedigree.A natural place, a worthy chapter in the History of Civilization and never to fade even unto glory.A bright star is born in the Defense of Thermopylae.The 300 has the everlasting to thank as time will provide all the help this offer could ever require.This film is its pedigree,without it we are mere mortal with it we live forever.",7,0,1,19 April 2008
Windtalkers," Closing in on the Empire of Japan
","This comment is if anything, uninformed as to the film itself and to the ways that the film tells a story.I was not impressed by the Enders character and even thought his self sacrificing was almost a conceit.The denial and the rude story about,first being awarded the Silver Star and which followed the story about his first commendation in which he received injuries probably should of taken him out of the war entirely.Its difficult to place because we are not saints, yet our efforts in the South Pacific were commented on by Admiral Halsey in a letter he wrote to the marines stationed on Guadalcanal in the latter period of 1942-my point is that theater of combat was real.It was then that our intelligence people did something that I wish even today that had been able to do at Pearl and that was break the Japanese Code.It is a terrible truth that we were close to making the right move, but to slow to beat history with our inability to act in light of the developments regarding the Empire of Japan at Pearl Harbor.The Japanese found out the hard way when we nailed there top guy as he was en-route through the air to one of the forward island positions.This was all due to our intelligence and the fact that we knew before hand what was to have occurred.The films storyline is of an intelligence ability that would allow open communication without the enemy knowing what was being communicated, because we had a secret weapon of sorts in the Navajo code talkers.The instances in the film,where the code talkers did what they trained to do were justifiably critical and paid dividends without much of a second thought.Both men who portrayed Navajo code talkers were assigned to the invasion of the Island of Saipan were understated and like the privilege of serving our country, intelligent and brave.This was done as a conservative note as to the films treatment of some of the unfriendly ways Native Americans have had to cope with being considered outsiders on there native soil.It is in fact a red face that seemingly causes all the problems, however the day is not lost on these resourceful Navajo code talkers.The difficult position had here is that both the Christian slater character and the Nicolas cage character present there ultimatum of never let these code talkers into the hands of the enemy while alive,Protect the code at all costs become a perceived edge of the relationship.This has the ability to limit as well as alienate these men and as well provides a difficult position from which to act.It is a very real struggle when the film allows one of the code talkers to die at the hands of a grenade thrown very wilfully by enders which was suppose to protect the code at all costs thus taking the life of one of the films heroes.He was by the way in the clutches of 4 Japanese soldiers as they were attempting a counterattack on what was suppose to be a secured position.Though the invasion was provided for on a big scale,there was very little that I would define as strategic.I would of not rested nights as well,however the film went about attempting to show a conflict in the life we know and the purpose had through this entertainment medium.The film provided a error in dividing our attention and as well made it hard to distinguish a particular course of action.That, in so far as history was concerned was not a problem-there was a very real focus,desire,commitment on our part to defeat the Empire of Japan.The attempt to showcase lifestyle was out of place,and as well the seemingly lack of character that pervaded the film was almost anti-war.It was anti-war because there was no purpose outside of names and such.It was as stated somewhat hard to figure as the film possessed a inability to convince this viewer that it was real.There was some shocking violence however, enders possessed a heroic position himself and went about conducting himself in such a way as to go beyond the call of duty and so exemplary were his actions in the field that he may of qualified for the Purple Heart awarded PostHumously.The captain of the campaign,Gunny(?) made a mention to Enders that was not understood entirely and I believe it is one of the failings of this film.This at all cost has all the earmarks of a mob-hit and not the need to know requirement that should of been present,this subject and the men whose lives it affected deserved better treatment.The film actually and its too bad is mediocre, because it fails to convince that we are in fact participating in an event that occurred in 1943.One review cited a formula recipe was what made this fail not the subject matter.",6,0,2,16 December 2004
