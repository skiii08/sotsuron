Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Excellent!
","I am a Star Wars fanatic, and I have been waiting to see this movie since I first heard they were making it several years ago.  On Tuesday, I realized that at midnight I would be finally seeing it.  And I was worried.  I didn't think it could possibly live up to the hype, I'd heard bad things about Jar Jar, and the critics before the movie came out had really chewed it up. So, I was first in line, first into the theatre, I sat through it, and I loved it. Not only were the special effects great, but the acting of the Jedi (Neeson and McGregor) was terrific, Natalie Portman was interesting as the queen, and Anakin was excellent.  There wasn't a whole lot of overly intelligent dialogue, but I wasn't expecting it, that's not why I like Star Wars.  And the foreshadowing and allusions to the later films, both those already out and those in the works, were absolutly terrific, especially Palpatines line to Anakin, 'We will watch your career with great interest.'  I don't really know how this movie stands on its own, I haven't had time to fully think it through yet, but I know that as part of the Star Wars Saga, it exceeded my expectations -- by a long shot.  Do yourself a favor and sit back, relax, and enjoy the show.  Don't analyze it, the movie theatre isn't school, enjoy it.",10,0,0,23 May 1999

","This movie was, to put it bluntly, awful. I knew going in that Ratner was a poor director, and my expectations were accordingly low, but I generally enjoy comic book adaptations, even the mediocre ones, so I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Too bad. The movie was worse than I had feared. It's a boring, silly movie, with any hint of the style and humanity with which Singer had imbued the series gone. Scenes that should have been powerful and affecting in the hands of a director with even the least bit of class and a modicum of talent are instead laughable -- literally. The audience was laughing in what should have been key dramatic moments. In this movie, there doesn't seem to be a reason for anything: Things happen for no reason. Characters do things for no reason -- or, worse, for no reason other than to set up some kewl special effect that's generally boring given its ridiculous context. Characters -- some of them important -- are discarded with no exploration of the consequences; other characters are added, mostly for no reason other than to throw them on the screen for a few moments. The 'bad guys' in this film are the ones who are fighting the right fight this time around, albeit in a thoroughly stupid manner; the 'good guys' act at best like morons and make decisions that make me question why I'm supposed to be rooting for their team. Dark Willow steps out of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and into the X-Men universe without the benefit of Whedon's punchy dialogue and humanity -- the dialogue here is so clich√©-ridden that the people around me, who had not seen the movie before, were delivering lines before the movie characters and getting them word-perfect. There's no character development in this movie (though there are, to be fair, several amusing moments, mostly involving Wolverine) -- just a lot of 'splosions and effects. But as George Lucas once said and seems to have forgotten, 'a special effect without a story is a pretty boring thing.' Sure, on a basic level lots of water floating around and explosions and bad weather and things disintegrating look fairly cool, but without any reason to care, what's the point? Even the fight scenes were mostly unsatisfactory, with characters zipping around and the camera snapping from angle to angle and character to character so frantically, so gracelessly, that it's nigh impossible to take any pleasure from watching it. This movie is an awful mess and an astounding disappointment, even given my low expectations. It's terrible from first to last. As far as sequels go, this one's down there with Highlander 2. To be avoided.",1,18,34,27 May 2006
