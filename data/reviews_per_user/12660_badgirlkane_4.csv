The Ring," This movie is so creepy!
",The Ring is a very creepy film with one of the most amazing plots. This is an excellent film! I never have seen Ringu but I've never been one for Asian films so I'm glad this was remade in an American version and still came out as good according to the people who have seen both films. Naomi Watts is a phenominal actress as good in this film as she was in Mullholland Drive as she adds a suspense element to her charachter which a lot of other actresses wouldn't be able to play on screen. The other actors in this film were nothing all that special though the young child actor who plays Ms Watts son in the film is a very good actor. The child villianess is as creepy as any horror boogeyman and the legend of watching this tape then dying 7 days later holds an urban legend like mythos that made this story truly terrifying.I loved the fact that even though I love horror films with excessive gore scenes The Ring was just as good without any gore in it.If you haven't seen this DO SO!!! One of the best horror films of all time! Thank you for Amercanizing a truly haunting film.***** out of *****,Null,1,1,13 April 2003
Resident Evil," Usually video game movies suck but this one was an alright horror film
","Paul W.S Anderson the man behind the Mortal Combat movies made this video game into a very decent horror/zombie film.I heard originally they had asked George A Romero ( The Godfather of Zombie films) to script this and direct this version and honestly as a horror film fan of both mainstream and independent horror films I feel this movie would've been less action film and more horrific if Mr Romero had written the screenplay and directed this film and it would've been more to my liking. However,MR Anderson did do a very good job at keeping this film suspenseful (though at times the filiming background is so dark you can barely see what is going on ) and the gore could have been a little more excessive especially considering this is a Zombie movie but for a mainstream film it was decently gory. Milla Jojovovich was very good as the films heroine and looked kick ass in her evening gown battle-dress and Michelle Rodriguez is hilarious as the overly tough girl character. It stayed as true to the videos game plot as it could and that actually worked well for the film. I have to say i'm actually looking forward to the sequel and am just glad that the Zombie genere has been brought back as after watching countless bad awful Italian zombie films I'm glad that my favorite horror genere is back in some form at least,as it doesn't look like Mr Romero has any plans to do a 4th Living Dead film and the only other talk that Hollywood has is its to  remake the classics that Mr Romero has already done and in my opinion shouldn't be reamde.There are classic horror films.LEAVE THEM ALONE!!!!!!!! but I beleive the sequel to Resident Evil will be sonething to look forward to in the summer of 2004 as will be the much anticipated sequel to Ginger Snaps as well. My only request is please make Resident Evil 2 more gorier and show more of the Nemesis monster as the computer-animated creature in Resident Evil was awesome looking ( and I usually hate computer-aniimated monster as they usually look so FAKE!!) .If you love Zombie films and ahve never seen one start off renting the Living Dead sereis then move on to Lucio Fulci 's classic 1980 fiolm Zombie then check out the underrated 1971 classic Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things , then check out the Resident Evil film. **** out of *****",Null,0,0,8 May 2003
Velvet Goldmine," I Love this Movie!
","This film about the rise and fall of a fictional rock star Brian Slade is probably the best fictious rock star movie ever written and made for the big screen.And the soundtrack is amazing! Kudos to the great British actor Johnathan Rhys-Meyers as the main man himself Brian Slade.He lypsinks very well to the songs and is another of a long line of great British actors. This is not a film for homophobes as their is an intense triangle romance beteween Ewan McGregor (who is so f'n cool as Curt Wild),Mr Meyers and actress Toni Collette. And there is a lot of boy on boy kissing and frolicking about. This film definatley captures the spirit and naughty sexual androygony of the early 70's glam-glitter rock era with the character of Brian Slade showing shades of David Bowie,Bryan Ferry,and the NY Dolls and the character of Curt Wild is so loosely based on Iggy Pop that i'm surprised his first name wasn't Iggy. Great soundtrack and and great film.Way to go Todd Haynes! ***** out of *****",Null,1,2,22 April 2003
Moulin Rouge!," Probally the best musical ever!
",This is an amazing movie! Considering neither of the main 2 stars are actual singers before this film shows just how talented Nicole Kidman and Ewan Mcgregor (who did scream-sing in the movie Velvet Goldmine) really are. I'm a huge fan of Mr Mcgregors and now of Ms Kidman who since her divorce from Tom Cruise has really shone as an actress in a way she never had before. Jim Broadbent and John Leguziamo are really great in this movie as well. Mr Leguziamo once again shows he can play in any type of film in any movie genre and new to the US movie screens but not to her native country of Australia is Caroline O'Connor who plays the charachter of Nini with her legs in the Air as her supporting role is a prominent one. The scenery is this film makes the movie the original songs and cover songs are done in a original way for a musical and this is just an awwesome musical! ***** OUT OF *****,Null,0,0,22 March 2003
