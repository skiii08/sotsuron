Kill Bill: Vol. 2," Tarantino, the one-eyed...
","Some critics say that Tarantino is nothing but a copycat. A guy with huge cinematographic knowledges that copies scenes and arguments from other movies that are completely unknown for most of the people (so nobody is gonna accuse him of copying something from a movie that no one's has seen). I agree with that up to a point, because he has 'stolen' stuff from other movies since the very beginning. He's the kind of artist that 'inspires' himself looking other's people work; but he's not the first, and won't be the last. Bowie did it, Warhol did it too, the Rolling Stones, even Picasso did. Hey, I'm not comparing Tarantino to that people, because for me Quentin Tarantino is not a genius (neither Warhol): for me is just a very smart guy, so talented, and so smart. He's just taking advantage of the fact that Hollywood only makes rubbish. So, as it's said here in Spain: in the land of the deaf, the one-eyed is the King. So, that's what Tarantino is: the one-eyed. He'd hardly stand out from 1930 to 1975. OK, let's talk about Kill Bill Vol.2:There's this saying 'after the storm the calm comes'. Kill Bill Vol.1 was the storm, the explosion, the action; and Kill Bill Vol.2 is the calm, the drama, less dynamic, but much more intense (emotionally intense). In Vol.2 The kicks, the killings, etc. from the first volume make way to the life-story of The Bride. Her personality, her relationship with Bill, her doubts and her fears, her training... her past. There's only one fight scene in Kill Bill Vol.1, the one between Uma Thurman and Daryl Hannah. But this doesn't mean KB2 is sort of a boring movie. No way. For me is the best of the 5 Tarantino movies, and the more serious. He may have copied ideas from some other movies, but he has definitely makes a great movie out of those 'inspirations' (and that's not easy to do). Maybe the final parts are too slow. The scenes with the Bride's daughter are not like Tarantino's... they're too sugary. But I guess the original story ends that way so there's nothing Tarantino could do about it. Uma Thurman makes the perform of his life, and so does David Carradine (though I think he's never been a great actor). Tarantino has the ability to resurrect the dead: he did it with Travolta, Keitel and Pam Grier in the past, and so he does with Hannah or Carradine in Kill Bill. Kill Bill Vol.2, one of the best Hollywood movies from 2004.PS: I assume the middle-American doesn't know a thing about Spanish or Mexican cultures. But Tarantino is a man of the world, so he should know how ridiculous is to put flamenco music in a scene that takes place in Mexico. In México they have rancheras, corridos, etc. but not Flamenco.",8,0,1,15 August 2004
Love and Death," Woody the clown
","'Love and death' belongs to that group of Woody's movies along with 'The Sleeper' or 'Bananas' in which the Jewish director showed how much he liked to act the clown. The mark of the years as stand-up comedian?? is huge, and so it is his devotion for the crazy situations influenced by the Marx Bros movies.I frankly prefer all the works that Woody made a few years later, such as 'Annie Hall' or 'Broadway Danny Rose', I think that's where he became a genius. Anyway, 'Love and death' will bring you tons of surrealistic situations and will make you laugh, no doubt about it.Woody forever!! *My rate: 6/10",6,3,8,14 March 2007
Walk the Line," Respectful and moving
","When I knew that Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon would play the leading roles in the Johnny Cash biopic I feared the worst. The so-affected Phoenix playing the man in black??? No way!! And what about the 'legally blonde' playing June Carter?? It looked like a bad joke.Now, I gotta swallow my words: Joaquin has made an impressing work playing Johnny Cash and singing his songs. And Reese put aside her prissy look and makes a so serious performing, also her work playing the songs is awesome.So, once the two actors did their job it's time for the director for creating a respectful movie to the figure of Cash. That's exactly what Mike Newell did. Maybe 'Walk the line' is not a thorough biography, but I think Johnny Cash himself would have liked it 'cause almost everything in the film it's about his love story with June.A brilliant and moving movie that honours the memory of one of the definitive personalities of 20th century and a music genius. We miss you, Johnny!! *My rate: 8/10",8,0,0,27 September 2006
Finding Neverland," Finding the meaning of life.
","Finding Neverland, finding the interior of a genius' head, his endless imagination, in the certain knowledge that keeping ourselves away from the adult world is what give us life and joy; finding a bear under the skin of a good-natured dog, finding the far-west in the garden of any given house of Victorian London; finding how an universal piece of art is developed.Finding that Johnny Depp knows how to be a great big actor, that he knows how to be sober and how he controls a different accent. Finding a little big man called Freddie Highmore, one of those children with an ancient look and an innate talent for performing (just like his female counterpart, Dakota Flanning). Finding a soundtrack and an editing that will drive you to the verge of crying.Finding what we already knew: Kate Winslet is one of the best, and Julie Christie or Dustin Hoffman have grew old in the wisest possible way. Finding that every day that goes by there are less Peter Pans left and that Captain Hook and his crew have won the battle. So if you want to be moved, if you want to laugh, if you want fantasy, if you want to feel like a child again and forget about the f***ing real world, just go and find Neverland. When the lump in your throat disappear just let your friends and family know about this film, they'll thank you for ever and ever.*My Rate: 9/10",9,2,2,14 May 2005
Akira," Remarkable...
","I am no expert in Japanese animation, I'm not even a big fan of that genre, but as far as I remember thanks to 'Akira' a lot of people got keen on 'manga' (at least here in Spain). The truth is that I have never felt like watching 'Akira', but I decided to watch it the last week... The first thing that called my attention is that it looks so modern, even though it was made almost 20 years ago. The story is pretty good (maybe too long), and that post-apocalyptic world it reminded me of 'Blade Runner' and stuff... It's just nice.Do you think that Wachowsky Btros 'borrowed' some ideas from 'Akira'? What do you say? The power to stop the bullets, for example...*My rate: 7/10",7,0,2,8 May 2006
Monster," Monstruous Performing!
","A real story of a prostitute (Charlize Theron) who suffered sexual abuses when she was a child, and decides to start killing every one of her clients. Also she falls in love with a girl (Christina Ricci) that meets in some gay bar. Predictable and linear to death, the structure of Monster is more suitable for a TV Movie; the script is second-rate, and they hasn't racked their brains writing down those dialogues. It seems like Patty Jenkins' idea of a lesbian is something like a trucker driver or so... Anyway, the script, the dialogues, the stereotypes, the worst sex scene ever, the boredom of it all, are not the worst things about 'Monster'. The worst thing of this movie is that one for which they gave it an Oscar: Charlize Theron. Let's see: Theron seems to believe that if you fatten yourself, put on colour contact lens, shave your eyebrows, get some false teeth, and walk around just like if you were John Wayne itself, you have it made (and so they think there in The Academy) ... No ma'am! It does not work that way. You gotta have talent. All that I've watched in Monster it's Charlize Theron in disguise. She's just not credible at all, at any sequence. I don't see an evil-psycho-hooker, I see some histrionic-overacting fat girl moving just like a bullfighter. Anyone can dress up, get a whig, and so ... But only the best actors can bring those kind of characters to life. Actors just like De Niro, Karloff, Hofman, or even Nicole Kidman. As I've said before, Monster itself is nothing to write home about, but even it if were, Charlize Theron's performance would have ruined it all. As for Christina Ricci, he does a good job as usual.

Dawn of the Dead," Pure Entertainment...
","OK, remakes haven't the same merit than the original thing and the most of the times are unnecessary and quite worst than the movie they're 'remaking'. However, there're exceptions to that rule, and Dawn Of The Dead (2004) is one of those. The starting point is the same as in George A. Romero's version: a group of people take refuge from the attack of the living dead in a shopping centre. But there're some differences that makes this remake much better and much frantic than the 1978's Dawn Of The Dead:1) It's not as long as the first version. Almost 40 minutes shorter.2) The living dead are fast as hell, which makes them much more terrorific.3) This movie is pure action, there's not a second's break.4) The use of digital cameras intensify the action scenes (especially to the of the movie)5) Obviously they've spent much more money than Romero did. Spending more money doesn't mean that you're gonna make a better film; but in this case it does. 6) There're no easy frights.7) (This may not be an advantage) Is not as darker an oppressive as the first version.Well, that's it. No pretensions but to make you have a funny-cary time. Zack Snyder definitely achieves that.My rate: 7/10",7,0,0,2 September 2004

If it wasn't for him I wouldn't even watched a movie just like this one, with all its American Dream speech, the winners, the losers, the 5 thousand $ prostitutes, the big cars, and all that crap from the Big Apple. Of course, at the end they give us some moral... yeah, right.It's nothing but a blockbuster, barely entertaining and with a good incentive for ladies: there they have Matthew McCounaghey with his 'I'm your man, baby' look.Why, Al, WHY????

","Terry Gilliam traveled again to the future (he had already done it in 'Brazil') to tell this story about a virus that's destroying the human race.The script is totally crazy with some easy tricks on it but it's quite entertaining and Gilliam proves that he's got imagination (the futuristic scenes are just great). As for the cast, Bruce Willis and the beautiful Madeleine Stowe (whatever happened to her??) are just OK, but Brad Pitt is so annoying, whenever he plays roles that are out of his hand he results so forced and he's not credible at all. He should just play good-looking successful young men.*My rate: 7/10",7,1,1,30 October 2006

"The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe"," Mediocre.
","I don't know why so many people are comparing this movie with 'Lord Of The Rings' trilogy. The stories haven't almost anything in common. Whereas 'LOTR' was a herculean production at the service of a great fable, 'Narnia' is a mediocre production with a pretty poor story (and with children on the main roles -SOS!!!-). As for the special effects, they're nothing to write home about. I guess the kids will enjoy the movie, but I do prefer other fantasy movies that are less pretentious and much more exciting (just like 'Neverending story', 'Willow'). The best things in 'narnia' are the expresiveness of the girl who plays Lucy, and the talking animals (those effects are really something). Just an ordinary movie... all talk.*My rate: 5/10",5,1,2,14 March 2006
Coffee and Cigarettes," Irregular
","The premise of this experiment from Jim Jarmusch conditions the final results: a series of couple (of celebrities) talking about nothing in particular, apparently they're improvising. So, some of the scenes are really stupid, such as the first one with Roberto Benigni or that one with the White brothers. Some others are really brilliant, especially that one in which Cate Blanchett splits into two characters and makes a parody of herself (great editing work and great performance of Miss Blanchett), it is also a nice self-parody the scene with Scott Coogan and Alfred Molina. As for the one with Iggy Pop and Tom Waits it's rather silly as well, but it's worth watching these two legends face to face.The final balance is irregular, but since the stories are very short is not a a boring movie.*My rate: 5'5/10",6,0,2,16 March 2007
Spider-Man 2," When the Factory Of Dreams DO Works
","Spiderman 2 is just amazing. Even the titles are great (thanks to Mr. Alex Ross). Nice production, perfect timing, moments for drama or action, moments for romanticism, and some astonishing special effects. Spiderman 2 is one of those movies that worth the money they've spent on it. Sam Raimi has finally left behind the shadow of 'Evil Dead' and makes clear that you can count on him to do anything (specially if you want to see a man jumping' from one NY building to another).Tobey Maguire perfectly plays the spider-man, and Kirsten Dunst is still MJ, Spiderman's beloved. They two make a wonderful couple. This time Alfred Molina plays the wicked one, and it's nice to see him playing such a different role (from those he uses to play).Cinema and comics have never get on well, but sometimes there's a perfect connection between them: Tim Burton's first 'Batman', The Crow, and, of course, this Spiderman.My rate: 7.5/10",8,0,0,29 April 2005
How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days," How to lose an hour and a half...
","Kate Hudson and Matthew McCounaghey in a romantic comedy... that doesn't look very well, don't you think? Is it a good film? Is it a bad film? It depends for whom. Me, I don't like this kind of products, 'cause they're rather predictable, you always know what is gonna happen, who's gonna fall in love with who, etc. I like some classics of that genre (especially the ones with Audrey Hepburn or Katharine Idem -Philadelphia Story, Breakfast At Tyffani's...), but only because they ARE original, and artifacts such as 'How To Lose...' are just a renewed copy of any of those classics. But if you like the romantic stories, with happy endings, kissing, and tons of love... don't think twice: this is your movie.*My rate: 4/10",4,0,1,30 March 2005
That Thing You Do!," Fresh and funny
","Even though is full of clichés 'the wonders' is such a fresh and funny movie, optimistic and with a nice rhythm. Plus it's full of nice music (not only the hit 'That thing you do') and the production design is as good as it's expected from a big studio product. It's impossible that you get boring watching it.Maybe the way that Hanks portraits that rock and roll band is rather idealistic, but that's him: the king of the comedy for the family, the son of America. Anyway, I think he did a good job considering it was her first movie as director. Also one never gets tired of watching Liv Tyler's big smile. Too bad her c.v. is full of romantic comedies an stuff.*My rate: 7/10",7,0,0,17 May 2008
Alexander," Oliver the Megalomaniac...
","There are too many things that look ridiculous in this biopic of Alexander the Great: 1) Mr. Farrell looks more like David Beckham than like a tough and unmerciful conqueror. 2) nobody would actually believe that a woman like Angelina Jolie can be the mother of a twenty-odd years old guy. 3) What about Oliver Stone's insistence on giving that ultra-gay touch to all the male characters? were Alexander and his crew nothing but a bunch of sissies?? I don't think so. And well, I could have overlooked all those facts if it wasn't because you can just remark a couple of scenes (the war ones) and the excellent photography out of the 3 hours of the movie.'Alexander' is a slow movie, superficial and boring, that contributes with nothing to the figure of Alexander the Great (looks more like a caricature of that man). The only megalomaniac in 'Alexander' is Mr. Oliver Stone.*My rate: 3/10",3,7,10,25 April 2006
Brokeback Mountain," Too much controversy = disappointment...
","Once upon a time there were two brawny cowboys that loved each other so much, and they spent the nights giving free hand to his love inside their tent there at the Wyoming mountains. They wished they could stay just like that for ever and ever, but it's not possible. In the deep America of the 60s (and at present time) it was quite a taboo to be a gay, so they'd better marry and have some children... the way is meant to be. Maybe they'll meet each other once a year and they'd be able to release they're true instincts... but that'll be all.Anytime a movie creates a big controversy you end up discovering that it wasn't that important at all. Ang Lee perfectly portraits those wonderful mountains, those streams, th sunsets... maybe he recreates himself too much (he just CAN'T make a movie of less than 2 hours). So, what's best about 'Brokeback Mountain'? Well, the photography, of course; the extraordinary beauty of those enclaves... and the work of Heath Ledger. I always thought he was a second rate-expressionless actor, but he makes a virtue out of that expressionless in this movie. He really looks like a redneck (even though he's born in Australia).*My rate: 7/10",7,1,17,11 July 2006
Match Point," Now it's time for drama!
","Now it's time for the drama in the Woody Allen universe, time for a veiled criticism to the mental void of the high classes of our occidental societies: the social climber and the lack of scruple when you gotta keep your status up. Woody pretends he's Hitchcock in some moments of 'Match point' that are full of suspense... he can do anything he wants, cinema has no secrets for him at this stage. If he wants some tension, he just creates it. And of course, he never forgets about the fake-intellectual people...As for the cast Allen rescued Jonathan Rhys Meyers from oblivion, and the guy has done a great job (maybe the best of his short career).

Sex, love, infidelity, the animal attraction... Well, 'Closer' is not that original, is it? Cinema has talked about all kind of relationships along the last 100 years. So, the virtues of 'Closer' are not in the story it tells but in the way Nichols tells it, his last movie is much more foul-mouthed and direct than the rest of his works. Is rather strange to hear Julia Roberts holding a conversation with huge explicitly sexual contents, or to watch strait-laced Natalie Portman moving like an expert stripper. Well, I don't think Mike Nichols is a great director, and I don't specially like none of the actors either, but the movie as a whole is not that bad...

According to this movie Truman Capote was a selfish and vain son of a b*tch with an evil tongue. Now I wonder, was Capote so effeminate? Well, I didn't new him personally, so I have to believe in what the movie reflects. Anyway, the performing of Philip Seymour Hoffman is really something.

Now somebody tell me what percentage of this film is been dedicated to clarify things about Anakin Skywalker and the whole Star Wars universe? Not even 25% of it. The rest is just pyrotechnics, digital effects, and all the stuff that money and modern technology can provide. We could also discuss about the lack of a really charismatic character in these new films. There's no Han Solo around here, man! Hayden Christiansen is way too far from somebody destined to become Darth Vader. What the hell is Darth Vader doing running down the flowery hill chasing Natalie Portman???

Corpse Bride," Burton rises again...
","After some shorts from his early days, after 'Beetlejuice' and 'Nightmare before Christmas', Tim Burton strikes back with his own universe skulls and characters that look like they've been created by a Gothic Dali. 'The Corpse Bride' contains a simple story: a fairy tale in which Snow White has her cranium inhabited by a talking worm (sort of a Jimmy Cricket from the afterlife), and lives surrounded by coffin-shaped furniture... The musical acts are played by black widows and skeletons instead of dwarfs and teapots... Walt Disney having fun in the Ghost Train, that's what 'The corpse bride' looks like... There's no doubt that Burton really enjoys this kind of projects: he doesn't have to deal with actors, or with the pressure of the big studios...Humor and romance delightfully macabre, for the eldest and for the young ones. This is the Tim Burton we love, not that one who makes awful remakes of Hollywood classic movies.*My rate: 7/10",7,0,0,13 March 2006
The Aviator," Magnificent.
","Howard Hughes was an iron and steel industry tycoon, a reckless pilot, he owned an airlines, he was a cinema producer, a playboyÂ… A man who live a hundred lives in just one, who defeated death itself after a brutal plane crash... A man that ended up devoured by his own personal demons, his neurosis and his phobias. They turned him into a hermit, locked up in a motel room. A great story to be adapted to the big screen... And who would adapt it better than Martin Scorsese (maybe the best director alive)? I think the first difficulty to avoid was the election of the main actor. I mean, if you choose the wrong guy then the whole project will crumble. Di Caprio, he's a hell of an actor, he's so good, but he still looks like a teenager. Anyway, that's something that all the actors of his generation have in common, so let's just say it is a lesser evil. He carries with the whole weight of the movie and that's a big pressure he just overcame. The rest of the cast is so good as well, specially Cate Blanchett who beautifully plays Katharine Hepburn. The only one who looks out of place is Kate Beckinsale (that poor little thing playing goddess Gardner?? Come On!!).A magnificent movie, so ambitious, that honour the legend of Howard Hughes and his megalomania. A good script that perfectly set out the 'hows' and the 'whys' of Hughes' descent into hell.

About 5 millions of Cambodians were murdered during the reign of the Jemers.'The killing fields' approaches to those events relating the odyssey of Pran, a Cambodian journalist who worked for NY Times. He had quite a hard time trying to escape from his country. This is a very hard movie, so shocking and explicit (though reality was much more shocking than fiction). It is one of the best manifests against war ever filmed (along with 'Johnny took his gun' and 'Paths of glory'), a perfect portrait of the horrors of war and the consequences of human madness. At the same time it's a story that stresses the importance of friendship and loyalty, and the survival instinct.

The Village," Shyamalan blooms again
","M. Night Shyamalan is one of those privileged minds, like Alejandro Amenábar, which have learned their lesson about how to tell stories, how to thrill, how to frighten us, how to attract people to the cinemas. Maybe they're not renovating the Seventh Art, but they sure can defend that sentence that says 'the movies are meant to entertain and make fun'. They're the first ones in the class when is time to tell disturbing plots, those who will keep your attention till the very end, and then will knock you out with a final twist. That's just and old trick with a big disadvantage: the second time you watch 'The 6th Sense' or 'The Others' you will feel a 99% less of excitement but I think that's a risk that is worth taking.After the delusion of 'Signs', Shyamalan reborns with 'The Village', a precious moral fable about a group of villagers that are besieged by some creatures who live in the adjacent woods. Shyamalan demonstrates that he knows how to go beyond that spectacular-final-twist-of-the-story from '6th Sense' or 'Unbreakable', that he can move us with innocence, and tenderness, even with a nice love story. He shows us only the things we need to see, he guides us, he handles us and his camera as he pleases, and he's good! His actors direction is just splendid, because it's not enough to have a bunch of great actors (Weaver, Hurt, Gleeson, Brody) no, you have to lead them with wisdom and talent, and M. Night never neglect his actors.'The Village' is just like a fairy tale, one of those that our grandfathers used to tell us, one of those we listened with our ears wide open one of those you wouldn't want to end.Yeah, we need Greg Aronofsky, Michael Haneke, or Takeshi Kitano; but we also need directors like M. Night Shyamalan, we need some escape, some fantasy, we need mystery. And he is quite capable of giving that to us every 2 or 3 years.PD: Pay attention to Bryce Dallas Howard. Pay attention to that red hair, those blue eyes, and that enigmatic beauty, 'cause she's gonna set tongues wagging.

Cold Mountain," The look of Nicole Kidman...
","I didn't watch The English Patient, so I can't talk about it; but I did watch Talented Mr. Ripley and it seemed to me that Minghella  an elegant filmmaker, sober and perfectionist, and an excellent actors director. Now, Cold Mountain corroborates all those qualities. He's adapted to the big screen a classic love story set in USA's Civil War, where a refining girl (Nicole Kidman) has to  face up to poverty and to the absence of her beloved one (Jude Law), who's gone to fight in the War. The movie has two main lines: Kidman's character's evolution from a well educated and respectable girl to a farmer; and the oddyssey of Jude Law to come back to her from the battlefield.Ok, the story is nothing extraordinary, there're plenty of movies in the same line (starting by that icon called Gone With The Wind); but there's only one Anthony Minghella. He looks after every detail, he lavish care every sequence, every shot. Photography is just spectacular, and so are the locations. Wardrobe and soundtrack are just nice. Since Cold Mountain is based on a novel (just like Talented Ripley -and English Patient I guess-), the narrative style is rather literary, with a voice over and such well cared dialogues. Maybe Anthony Minghella's biggest defect is that he takes pleasure in every scene, in every view, in every look, and that makes his movies a little too long, and a little slow sometimes. He seems to be incapable of making a 90 minutes movie.
As for the cast, well, this is the very strong point of Cold Mountain. Nicole Kidman shines so bright, and she demonstrates that her talent seems to have no limits (maybe it's nothing to do with it, but since she divorced Tom Cruise she has incredible grown as an actress, so much so that she's become the best actress from his generation). Also her beauty is remarkable, she's more beautiful now than when she was 25 or 30. No doubt she's the most memorable thing in Cold Mountain. I'm not much of a Jude Law's fan, I think he's quite unexpressive, and without many registers, but maybe a more histrionic actor wouldn't have fit the character. I don't know much about american accents, but it seems to me that Mrs. Zellweger makes a good job imitating an accent that's not her natural one (and she takes charge of the funny points in CM -that's something she sure knows how to do-). There's also an impressive team of supporting actors: Donald Sutherland, Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Philip Seymour Hoffman ... a top quality cast. One of the best Hollywood pictures from 2003. A wise way of spending the money from the Studios.My rate: 8/10",8,2,3,5 August 2004
"I, Robot"," In the mood for... an Audi!
","I don't know why, but when I finished watching 'I robot' I desperately wanted to have an Audi (a big one) OK, no gibes! Alex Proyas had previously demonstrated in 'Dark City' and 'The Crow' that he was quite capable of making nice futuristic-action movies, how much he liked the video-clip look, and how good he is mixing shots, explosions and an interesting and entertaining plot, so this new work from Proyas is not an exception. Nowadays you don't know if artifacts such as 'I, Robot' should be considered as 'animation movies' because of the continuous presence of sets and characters designed by a computer. Anyway, let's accept this is the future (or the present) of cinema: the fusion of flesh and animations. The aesthetic of the film seems to be highly influenced by the last Spielberg's works ('A.I.', 'Minority Report'), and the argument absorbs ideas from classics of the sci-fi genre such as 'Blade Runner' or '2001' (and I don't mind if you think that's a cliché). Nevertheless, Proyas has constructed a more commercial product than Kubrick's or Scott's ones, much more aimed to the masses, and so he adds some pyrotechnics from 'Terminator 2', or that cynical-with-shady-past-cop, just like Bruce Willis characters (in fact, he could have been a nice election for the film just if he was 10 years younger). Will Smith makes a nice job: he'll never be a great actor, but he perfectly fits in this kind of stories.In short: an story of a good cop who has to face a army of angry robots pretty funny, and just perfect to be enjoyed in one of those awful shopping center cinemas with an XXL-sized bag of pop-corn.PD: Maybe V.I.K.I. wasn't that wrong My rate: 7/10",7,0,0,5 March 2005
Judgment at Nuremberg," Masterpiece
","The significance of movies such as 'Judgement at Nuremberg' goes far beyond its cinematographic values. It's a masterpiece, no doubt about it, and Stanley Kramer built quite a serious and emotional movie... But what's most important about a movie like this is that deals with universal questions, it's a wise and lucid reflection about the World War II, about the motives that lead the Germans to do what they did.And what could I say about the cast? Tracy, Lancaster, Monty Clift... the kings of acting.Superb picture.*My rate: 9/10",9,2,6,25 March 2007
Van Helsing," Where's the Mummy??
","Putting aside that Van Helsing perverts some of the best terror stories of all times (Dracula, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde, Frankenstein, The Werewolf...); putting aside that some of the jokes in the script seem to have been written by some Benny Hill wannabe; putting aside that some performances are really pathetic (Kate Beckinsale's accent!! ---grrrrr--); putting aside that it is supposed to be a terror movie but scares no one; putting aside that the love story between Van Helsing and Beckinsale's character rather looks like a bad parody; putting aside that the strong point of VH, the special effects, are nothing that spectacular (at least they're not innovative at all, like Matrix's, or Minority Reports', for example -and some make-up tricks are really grotty- )... putting aside too many things, we can say this is a (sometimes) entertaining movie, full of crazy action, way too long (2 hours 15 minutes), and with too many boooooms, and bangs, and ratatatata, ... OK, I guess that was the intention of the producers, and of Sommers himself (The Mummy, The return Of The Mummy, The goddamn mummy strikes back -he's sort an specialist of s***ting on classic terror stuff) ; but still I think you can make such a poor product like this spending 100 times less money than they have.Conclussions: they could've made a nice Playboy Gothic-video using the female cast in Van Helsing, and maybe give the rest of the money to someone with ideas, talent, and something to say. That of course would happen in a perfect world. In this world of us they prefer to let audiences (the real targets of this kind of trash) think that Van Helsing was a shooter, that Dracula and Dr. Frankenstein knew each other and shared some bears and some 'brides', and that Mr. Hyde was the cigar-smoking punk cousin of The Hulk. OK, then. To hell with Shelley, to hell with Stevenson, to hell with Stoker... Well, to hell with you, Mr. Sommers.My rate: 3.5/10",4,0,1,10 October 2004
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," The replacement for Kevin Smith...
","Well, the title prophesies what we're gonna watch, doesn't it? For those who miss the early years of Kevin Smith or the Farrelly brothers here comes Judd Apatow to take over from them all after an intense career as a scriptwriter. Loose laughing at Steve Carell's character expenses: the pathetic existence of a 40 years old dude that hasn't ever had sex and that fills his life with video games, internet, an iron discipline... but at the end of the day sex is always knocking' at the door. 40 years, Jesus Christ!! Maybe the weak points of the movie are its excessive length (more than 2 hours for a comedy doesn't sounds very nice) and the flirting with the romantic comedy at the end. Without that it would be a perfect comedy, so rowdy and foul-mouthed. At least is one of the most funny ones that I've watched lately.*My rate: 8/10",8,0,1,31 March 2006
Collateral," Michael Mann = Life Insurance
","A hit man (Tom Cruise) kidnaps a taxi driver (Jamie Foxx) to use him as his personal chauffeur during several of his 'jobs'. Jamie Foxx's character will be torn between empathy (the killer is not a bad guy) and rejection (but hey, the boy is quite an unmerciful butcher), and eventually he'll have to make a decision.Nice mainstream action cinema made but one of the more classy specialist on this kind of stuff, Mr. Michael Mann (Heat, The Insider). A nice script, good tension, and Tom cruise making a good job, which is quite a surprise (he seems to give his best only when playing amoral characters -maybe he identifies more with'em-).Michael Mann knows exactly what the audience wants, but that doesn't mean he has to make second rate products. Not at all. When it's tome to film a big project with big money, and some stars, Michael is the 'mann'. Not everything is perfect in 'Collateral' though... The character of the girl (Jada Pinckett) is pretty diffuse and forced. One of the best films of the year as far as the commercial movies is concerned.*My rate: 7.5/10",8,0,1,13 December 2005
The Machinist," Kamikaze Bale
","The Machinist was made with Spanish money but had an undoubted international vocation (the cast, the perfect making). The movie it's all about the bad conscience as a weapon of massive destruction of our lives. Not only keeps us awake night over night but also absorbs our whole existence, it fattens up out of our suffering. The audience will be completely disconcerted for about 80 minutes, because the story, the 'whys', the 'hows' will show up at the very end of the film in only 2 or 3 minutes. Anyway, the images are powerful enough to get you stuck to your seat. So The Machinist is a nice thriller in the Lynch way (never as good as the Canadian genius)... but there's something in it that deserves to be underlined: Mr. Christian Bale. What an actor! He's a real kamikaze, just like Lon Chaney, just like De Niro used to be. Bale lost so much weight for the movie that he looks like a living-dead (I guess they didn't need any make-up). Someone who puts in risk his own physique just to build the perfect character can only receive our praises. The rest of the cast shrinks compared with Bale's work, but Jennifer Jason Leigh makes a good job (her typical 'living on the edge' role), and Aitana Sánchez Gijón demonstrates she's as good acting in English as she is in Spanish. If you liked 'Lost Highway' or 'Memento' go and give 'The machinist' a chance, you won't repent.*My rate: 7/10 (20/10 for Bale!)",7,8,13,21 September 2005
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," I'm 27 and I love Potter... is it good, Doctor?
","When they released Harry Potter's first movie I must confess I was a little bit reluctant; I mean, I thought it was gonna be such an stupid thing like all those Walt Disney 90's products (Mermaid, Alladdin, and so), those movies that are to be watched by stupid children. Anyway, I decided to watch it (I hadn't read none of the books neither), and it was quite a surprise. It reminded me of some great fantasy movies that I've always loved such as 'Labyrinth', 'Neverending Story', etc. I really liked it, and I liked the second part two. Mr. Columbus made an outstanding job to be enjoyed by children, adults, grandpa's Now this 'Prisoner Of Azkaban' came with some changes: first of all the director wasn't Chris Columbus anymore, and instead of him they recruited Alfonso Cuarón ('Y Tu Mamá También'). I thought that he wouldn't be as good as Columbus, just because he has no experience on filming fantasy stuff, full of special effects and with a big big budget But then again I was wrong: Cuarón has demonstrated that he is as good in this genre than in any other else.'Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of Azkaban' is the darkest movie of this series, full of terrifying creatures, and with a nice plot. You won't look away for a second all along its 140 minutes of length. The story it catches you, that fantasy world, Howard's, the teachers, the talking pictures!, and some secrets that are revealed. The starring trio does it as well as in the two previous parts. We've lost Richard Harris as the director of the school (rest in peace, Mr. Harris), but Michael Ganbom makes a honorable substitution. We got some new teachers two, such as Emma Thompson's weird character (look at those glasses!!!), and last but not least, we got the Prisoner of Azkaban: the histrionic (that's why I love him, any problem about it?) and excessive Gary Oldman.The best that someone can say about a movie like this is that it is QUITE an entertaining artifact. I like drama, and social cinema but from time to time you need to go back to your childhood, and escape from this adult world watching movies like Harry Potter's ones.My Rate: 8/10",8,0,2,25 March 2005

Finally we got a quality product for the children (and for those who are not children too!), just like the ones of the good ol' days, far away from the Disney stuff and its prudiness. Those who were children in the 80's will find in 'Chihiro' some reminiscences of Michael Ende's 'Neverending story'.As for the animations, some of the characters are much m ore expressive than most of the young Hollywood actors!!

A good budget for a pretty bad movie. Barely entertaining, so (soooooo) far from the original Alien series and even from Schwarzenegger's Predator. Well, who cares?

","Legends Of The Fall, the movie that made a legend out of Brad Pitt for millions of women in this planet. I don't blame them. There's no doubt he's so good looking, so blonde, those blue eyes... but he's never been quite a good actor. As form the movie itself: a long-epic-melodramatic story about an old man which lives in the mountains, far away from the American civilization (which he hates so much). Anthony Hopkins plays that old man in one of his worst works ever (especially when his character falls ill with some facial-paralysis); Pitt is one of his three sons, the wiser one, the more handsome (of course), such a wild guy. Lots of topics, lots of common places for a movie that aimed to be sort of a modern 'Gone With The Wind': war, love, death...Well, there ain't many bad things to tell about 'Legends Of The Fall', apart from the fact that everything is so obvious and predictable in it. Nevertheless, I think it is not a bad movie.*My rate: 5.5/10",6,1,4,12 September 2005

","The film that tells about the beginnings of the superhero (obviusly), his motivations, why he turned into an outsider if he was a rich guy, where did his anger come from... It is by all means the most dramatic of all the adaptations that have been made from the original comics. Nevertheless it doesn't neglect something that's essential in a superheroes' movie: the action, the spectacular stuff... I don't know if the fans of the comic books will agree with the treatment they've given to the movie, but I have never ever read a Batman comic, so I can just talk about what I've watched in the screen (and about the Tim Burton's adaptations -I haven't watched Batman Forever and batman & Robin either-). And I've really liked what I have watched. The recreation of Gotham is just perfect, awesome; and the cast is unbeatable: Christian Bale makes a nice splitting work (don't you think that he's resumed his American Psycho character for playing Bruce Wayne??), and the list of the supporting actors is one of the most impressive of the last years: Caine, Neeson, Freeman, Hauer... Christopher Nolan really knows how to do his job. *My rate: 7.5/10",8,0,1,29 January 2006
Before Sunset," Romance + Intelligence
","'Before Sunset' and 'Before Sunrise' are two perfect examples of how to make romantic movies that are deep and intelligent at the same time. I couldn't say what's the best one. As far as I can see, it's only a single movie to me.It may look like a movie easy to make, but if you pay attention to all those long sequences of Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy walking in Paris... Well, you gotta be a great director to do it right. And what to say about Ethan and Julie? Them both have grown as performers (especially Hawke) and they make an outstanding job here, facing all those never ending dialogs.PS: It makes no sense to watch 'Before Sunset' if you haven't watched 'Before Sunrise'.

He'll try to endear himself to them by creating a choir.As you can see the argument is in broad terms the same you've watched in dozens of movies, the characters are a little bit stereotyped (a good teacher, an evil director, a bad guy that eventually turns into the teacher's best friend...). Anyway, is there anything left to talk about in cinema or in literature? No, there's not. I think almost everything's been told by now.So 'Les choristes' is not the most original film ever , but the film-making is pretty nice and is full of tender, sense of humor, optimism and good values. It was one of the most successful European movies of the last year, the film everybody's been talking about round here.

I admit that those who doesn't feel anything special for music won't feel much attracted to Velvet Goldmine.It is not a proper musical but it isn't a common movie either. It's kind of a hybrid, and neither the life-story of fictitious rock star Brian Slade is nothing special nor the narrative line is too powerful.So, if you like the seventies, Ziggy Stardust, Telegram Sam, the glitter... if you like rock and roll you'll enjoy Velvet Goldmine (that's for sure).

Hellboy," Hell Yeah!
","Another comic-based movie, some may sayÂ… and yes, this is another comic-based-movie. I don't know if that's another sign of the lack of ideas there in Hollywood or it's just a coincidence they're bringing all those superheroes to life. Whatever, now is the turn for Mike Mignola's Hellboy to get into the cinemas. A demon which escaped from hell and brought up by a priest who will teach him to fight again all those evil creatures that break on through to our dimension from time to time.Directed by Guillermo Del Toro ('Cronos', 'Mimic'), 'Hellboy' doesn't make the same mistakes that products such as 'Van Helsing' do: I mean, the digital effects are at the service of the story and not on the contrary. Del Toro makes a good drawing of his characters, he avoids any up and downs, and achieves a nice and praiseworthy 'in crescendo' effect. He didn't go mad neither choosing the actor: he recruited a cast of non-stars such as Ron Perlman (City Of The Lost Children), who performs a perfect Hellboy that it can be defined as a mixture of Hulk and Tom Waits. John Hurt plays the priest (Hellboy's godfather), Selma Blair plays the hero's beloved one, and a crew of nice guest starrings (mainly unknown, at least in Europe) do the rest.Conclussion: nice escapist cinema, well conducted action, a very solid script and, above all, Ron Perlman in state of grace (he demonstrates he's one of the most versatile actor of the last 25 years). It's no surprise that directors such as Jeunet or Annaud love him.*My rate: 7.5/10",8,0,0,30 June 2005

Sometimes those comedies are much more good than the usual Hollywood ones.The story is as follows: the society has forbidden the 'work' of the superheroes so Mr. and Mrs Incredible have to go on with a normal life (he works as an assurance agent, and she's a housewife). Did I mention that they got two children? Well, they do... Soon they'll be involved in serious troubles because of the menace usual bad-guy...Tons of references to the superheroes-genre, a lot of funny dialogs and situations. It's not Shrek, but it's quite a nice and entertaining comedy. For the youngest and for the oldest... Nobody will get disappointed.PS: Here in Spain we've had to 'suffer' the horror of some poor dubbing (specially Ether Arroyo's work).

The Elephant Man," Essential.
","There is no feeling, no virtue, no human baseness 'The Elephant Man' doesn't scrutinize: hypocrisy, cruelty, mercy, sadism, love...). David Lynch reached the status of genius with his second movie, he created an instant classic for the history of cinema, a masterpiece. He probed his huge talent beyond the oniric or surrealistic fits of 'Eraserhead' (and of most of his filmography). He probed he's capable of doing anything he wanted to with a camera on his hands. For those who think Lynch is just a pretentious guy which only films nonsenses, please take a look at this movie.As for John Hurt, he didn't need to become the elephant man to demonstrate he's one of the best actors of his generation; nevertheless, he accepted the challenge... and he won. He made an outrageous display of physical and mental effort, and of body talk. I can't imagine how hard it was for him to carry that disguise all along the whole filming.

K-19: The Widowmaker," A good work of Mrs. Bigelow
","Putting aside how ironic is to watch an American movie tell a story about the URSS Army, putting aside any political or moral matters, I can say 'K-19' is a nice movie which belongs to that sub-genre of submarines (along with Red Alert, Red October, etc.), nice filmed, with nice rhythm and a good narrative tension. Kathryn Bigelow'curriculum is not precisely the richest in Hollywood ('Point Break' is a good action movie, but that's all), but this time she perfectly portraits what it means to be in a war submarine, the claustrophobia, the suffocating heat, the sweat... Though the movie length is +/- 140 m. it does not drag, on the contrary you quickly get into the story.The election of veterans and experienced Liam Neeson and Harrison Ford to play the main roles is wise enough. You may find Harrison Ford's latest movies unworthy of an actor of his size (I do think so), but this time the movie is good enough and he does a good job as the submarine Captain.Two thumbs up for the special effects that bring to life that impressive submarine.*My rate: 6.5/10",7,0,1,8 May 2005
Million Dollar Baby," Clint will never let us down!
","There's something that characterizes Clint Eastwood's films: he usually makes a nice movie out of a simple story. Anyone else would have converted Million Dollar Baby into such a TV Movie or something, kind of a 'Karate Kid' mixed up with a moral conflict. Nevertheless Eastwood has a steady hand, he's tough when he thinks he has to, and he's spectacular when he thinks the story can afford it. Once again he plays the lead role: the cynical-skeptical-heartless old man unable to feel anything for anyone  till he finally does. Someone will say Clint Eastwood can only play one character; OK, maybe that's true: but he is the best playing it. Hillary Swank makes a great job, bringing to life that white-trash-boxer-aspiring (the first time she participates in such a nice project since 'Boys Don't Cry').A good movie as was to be expected if Clint Eastwood is behind and in front of the camera. And, why not, he resolves it courageously (there are some subjects that they don't want to talk about there in the United And Puritan States Of North America).My rate: 7.5/10",8,3,5,27 February 2005
Garden State," Great debut
","Thanks to his debut Zach Braff becomes part of that group of directors, such as Wes Anderson or Tiodd Solondz, that are more interested in the characters than in the story; more interested in reflections and deep messages than in pyrotechnics. In 'Garden State' Zach plays himself the main role, a young whose life is all messed up and that comes back to his hometown to assist to his mother's funeral.

Or maybe I'm getting' old and I'm not able anymore to catch as many frames per seconds as I used to when I was a teenager... Tons of digital techniques (Matrix-influenced), the shadow of latest zombies-cinema (Dawn Of The Dead, 28 Days Later), and a story nobody really cares about (or did you?). Everything en RS2 is just an alibi to show us the athletic condition of Miss Jovovich and their 'partners in crime'.It may look entertaining for the first 20 minutes or so, but that's all. However, I didn't expect that much of a video game-based movie, so it hasn't disappointed me. Resident Evil gives you exactly what you expect: action, explosions, blood, and scary creatures.

Shrek 2," That cat!
","Shrek 2 begins at Shrek and Fiona's honeymoon. Just where we left them in the first part. Everything goes just fine for our favourite ogres, but tranquility won't last that much. Soon they'll have to leave they're peaceful marsh to go and visit Fiona's parents at the kingdom of Far Faraway. And it's in Far Faraway where the real fun begins.I'm not very keen on animation movies. I've just watched a few ones (Shrek 1 & 2, Monsters Inc., Titan A.E, Final Fantasy...), and I really don't consider them as real cinema. But let me tell you: It does not matter to me if Shrek 2 is real cinema or it isn't, because it has the more lucid, witty, and funny script that I've seen in the last years. It goes without saying that Shrek 2 is quite better than the first part. The basis is the same: parodies of classic fairy tales (Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Pinocho, Puss In Boots) , recent Hollywood hits (Lord Of The Rings, Mission: Impossible, Meet The Parents...), and American TV shows (E!, Cops...). OK, there're dozens of movies that rely on that (Scary Movie, Hot Shots, Top Secret..), and I hate almost each and every one of them; but whereas in most of that movies parodies are brute and clumsy , in Shrek they're just brilliant: you'll kill yourself laughing again and again. As for the characters we got Shrek, the Donkey, Princess Fiona, and all the fairy tale creatures (Pinocho, Three Little Pigs, ...), and all the ones we met in the first part. Of course, thre're a lot of new incorporation's: and the best of all'em is the Puss In Boots. In the Spanish version (the one I've watched), Antonio Banderas dubs the cat as he did in the English one. I've always mistrust Banderas' capacity for dubbing. My fellow country-man (he's from MÃ¡laga, just like me) is quite a good actor, so temperamental and versatile; but he dubbed some of his first characters in Hollywood, and he made clear that he wasn't born to dub himself. Anyway, I must say that he's made a superb job dubbing the cat. The best character (for me) from Shrek 2. Each and every one of the cat's appearing are just hilarious (the one at the dungeons!!!). Of course, Shrek and the Donkey are so funny too, but I can't help it: the cat kills me. Last but not least let's talk about the animations themselves: JUST ASTONISHING! As I've said before I haven't watched many animation movies, but I can't figure out how Shrek animations could possibly be overcome. Character's expressions are incredible. They do it even better than the most of present-day actors! Ben Affleck o Mark Wahlberg wouldn't be able to look as innocent as Puss In Boots (in the scenes in which he does).

It was brutal, grotesque, and it had certain influences from David Fincher's works (specially from 'Seven'). Now, if you thought 'Saw I' was way too morbid, you haven't seen anything yet!! 'Saw II' is twice as sickly brutal as the first part. Those guys, the writers, are completely mad, they have much more imagination than any psycho-killer that ever existed. We could discuss about how this kind of products may affect people: I mean, there's a lot of material here the psychos can take note of!! But hey, I'm not a psycho, and I think 'Saw II' is totally addictive. An orgy of blood and murders, so aggressive and fast, and with some nice industrial rock in the background.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Amusing.
","A nice adaptation from Roal Dahl's story that had been already adapted in the 70's by the Disney factory and with the great Gene Wilder playing the main role. We could debate about why Tim Burton has gone into remakes lately, if that means that the muses have left him, that he has lost his 'touch'. Yeah, we could cry over him and complain... but what for? That's life! This brand new Willy Wonka is just matchless, Burton has wisely used the technical advances and he's put them at the service of this amusing story. The colors, the psychedelia, the laughing, the tenderness and (as in any fable) the moral: in Wonka's world the richest, the selfish and vain people, they all lose. The biggest difference between this adaptation and the Disney one is in the Willy Wonka's character. This time we're told about his past, we know more details about him and why he acts the way he does (there are several flash-backs that shows us Willy as a child).As for the actors, Johnny Depp is the boss here. It should've been a big mistake to try to imitate Gene Wilder's creation, so Johnny has released his most histrionic instincts and he's got a bull's eye. The rest of the cast is just perfect, but as I've said before, Johnny is the true (and only) starring in 'Charlie and the chocolate factory'.*My rate: 7.5/10",8,3,6,9 January 2006
Black Hawk Down," Maybe one of the best war-movies of the last 15 years.
","Ridley Scott is an almost 100% reliable director, so anytime you start to watch one of his movies you know he's gonna give you just what you expected, and that he won't disappoint you. 'Black Hawk Down' is one of those cases. It tells the (real) story of an US Army troop which gets into Mogadiscio in order to oust some wicked Somalian generals, but this time the US got their fingers burnt, 'cause once they got into the downtown they realized that the zone was a terrible wasps' nest. From that moment on we assist to one of the more shocking and thrilling war-movies of the last years. Everything looks so goddamn real in 'Black Hawk Down', it reminded me of the beginning of 'Saving Private Ryan' with that camera that never quits on moving, it seems like the blood that comes out from the soldier's injured bodies is gonna splash you, you can even feel the heat (that yellowish tones of the photography increases the sensation of heat).This time there are no fascist-reactionary-kingsoftheworld messages like in most of US war movies. This time the US army was there just to pay real help to the Somalian people. So it was the perfect situation to show the starkness and the brutality of war. No, there are no messages but 'how absurd are wars' or 'why do soldiers REALLY go to fight?'.The crew of actors is just OK: Josh Harnett, Tom Sizemore, Ewan McGregor... anyway, they're not the most important thing at all in 'Black Hawk'. You don't even have time to think about the actors: you just see soldiers, you feel like you're watching a documentary, not a movie.Two thumbs up for Mr. Scott.

Pixar were pioneers not only in the world of 3D animation but also in offering products that might entertain children and adults.I do prefer movies such as 'Antz' or 'Shrek', but I think 'Toy story' is so funny as well. Anyway, we can't avoid the 'Disney touch' and all those awful songs...So, after 'Toy story' came other movies that were much better, but this was the first one and it has a relevant position in the history of cinema.*My rate: 6/10",6,4,12,14 March 2007
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Be careful with what you ask for...
","What if your girl (by some kind of technical advances) would erase you from her mind? What if you (in revenge) would do the same? This is the starting point for a crazy story made by french director Michekl Condry and co-written with by Charlie Kaufman (they had previously worked together in that disaster called 'Human Nature'). As in most o Kaufman's scripts you can't figure out if it is such a complex and perfect engine or only some pages stapled at random. Anyway, this time he made it! The moral is quite clear: nobody's perfect, nor even the love of your life. Her/his defects are his/her virtues as well; and if you kill your couple in your head you're killing yourself too. When relationships get so intense then your couple is part of you and you're part of your couple.Kaufman and Gondry make us quickly identify with the main character as his memories are being erased (and with them his own world, his present and his future). They force us to fall in love with the girlfriend, played by the so inspired (and beautiful) Kate Winslet; they let us understand why that man is in love with that woman, how does it hurt to lose her, and how impossible is to try to replace your soul-mate. Jim Carrey, the long-suffering boyfriend, plays his most sober and austere character, it seems like it is a part specially written for him (though it is a dramatic character, he needs to resort to that hysterical clown inside him in a few sequences). Guest-starrings are not that bad , but they're nothing but filling (Hollywood stars-filling: Dunst, Wood...).So 'Eternal Sunshine...' is quite confusing, the sense of narration is completely lost here (as in most of Kaufman's works). But that's why it is so amusing. Because of its nonsense, because of the absurd of it all: the laughing, the tenderness, the tears... No one will be indifferent about this movie: some will disconnect after 5 minutes, and some will ask for more and more, even though they now exactly how the story is gonna end. A little jewel from latest (almost)independant American cinema.PD: Three hurrays for Spanish movies titles translators. They called this movie 'Forget About Me'... That's it boys! In your face! (God, do they REALLY get paid for doing that?) *My rate: 7.5/10",8,0,2,30 April 2005
Saw," Gee!! This is real hardcore!!
","The first impression I had while watching 'Saw' was: hey, this looks like a mix of 'Cube' and 'Seven' (two persons in a room not knowing why are they there, the way the murderer kills his victims...) ... then, also for a while, I started to think that they've converted a nice idea into a cheap thriller where the good guys (or the victims) get safe and the bad guys are defeated... but wow!! Wan really takes us in!!.Obviously, due to the ultra-violent content of Saw and the grotesque atmosphere of it it's not a movie to be watched by the most sensitive persons. I'm not gonna judge if this kind of stuff has a justification (the violence and the blood, ... it's like they had made a brainstorming about how to kill in the most disgusting way), the fact is that you'll spend a very nice time watching 'Saw' (if you like this kind of disturbed material).*My rate: 7.5/10",8,0,1,19 December 2005
National Treasure," Urban Indy
","National Treasure is kind of an urban Indiana Jones (an ordinary guy playing the hero, some action, some comedy)but John Turteltaub is not Spielberg. Nicholas Cage's character is obsessed with some old treasure, the biggest ever (his father looked for it too, and his grandpa), and he'll get through any kind of troubles in order to find it.In the beginning of the movie Turteltaub uses lots of 'slow-motion' and other digital effects, but after a while he (wisely) puts all that stuff aside and films the story in a more serious way. The cast is just nice, but the characters are so stereotyped and the dialogs are rather poor and hackneyed.It is OK if you just want to kill time (maybe it is a little too lengthy).*My rate: 6/10",6,0,1,3 October 2005
The Descent," Fairly entertaining...
","A group of adventurous girls decide to descend into a big cavern nobody ever had descent before. There they'll bump into the unexpected... The first half of the movie is quite attractive, but as soon as the 'mystery' is revealed the plot ends and begins an orgy of blood and fast camera movements. And the ending... well, the ending is rather mediocre. Some good frights and the typical characters of adventure/horror movies: the reckless one, the expert, the tough one, and the faint-hearted (that eventually demonstrates she's the strongest of them all). I guess the real merits of 'The descent' are in the technical aspects: it ain't easy to film a movie in in such small and dark interiors. I don't recommend this one to those who suffer from claustrophobia. For the rest of you, well, it's a fairly entertaining film. *My rate: 5/10",5,2,4,9 March 2006
Inside Man," A master plan!
","Spike Lee moves away from the social dramas to bring us the perfect robbery, one of those whose development leaves us speechless 'cause they're so creative.The script is just impeccable although the intensity flags a little in the last 15 minutes, after the robbery (but the truth is that this part of the movie is incredibly thrilling).As for the cast, there ain't much to say about it: Washington, Plummer, Jodie Foster... even Clive Owen makes a hell of a performance. As we say over here: 'la creme de la creme!'*My rate: 8/10",8,2,3,30 October 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," Potter resists...
","The fourth episode of Harry Potter's adventures follows the example of the previous three ones: tons of fantasy and entertainment. Potter keeps growing and his adventures become more adult, many details about his ultra-enemy Lord Voldemort are revealed. The special effects are just awesome, but the movie is a little too long (2 hours and a half!!), with some sequences that look like they're there just to pad the movie out (the one with the dance and all that). Like it or not Harry Poter's saga will become a thing of the past like one of the greatest adventures from the big screen, along with 'Indiana Jones', 'Back to the future', etc.*My rate: 7/10",7,0,1,28 June 2006
War of the Worlds," 70% Spielberg
","It seems like SPielberg's being waiting till the advances in digital technology have let him make 'War the worlds' in the way he needed to do it. So, there's no doubt: the movie is technically perfect, amazing. But when it's about S.S. we all know what we're gonna have, and there are no surprises (except for the expected ones). So in this massive extraterrestrial invasion we got the best Spielberg (the one that's expert on terrify people, the master in suspense), and the worst side of the Jewish director: the demagogue, the one with a dubious morality, the happy endings...As for the actors, Dakota Fanning keeps on amazing me; she's one of the best child-actors ever. And Tom Curise... well, let's say he's passed this test.*My rate 6.5/10",7,0,1,19 December 2005
Man on Fire," An entertaining-fascist-violent action movie...
","The novel this movie is based on had a first adaptation in 1987, but I haven't' watched that film , so I cannot compare. As for this new adaptation, it is a story about kidnappings, ransoms, revenge, and corruption in the city of Mexico with Denzel Washington playing the main role: an alcoholic ex-marine disenchanted from life that ends up working as a bodyguard for a rich men's little daughter (Dakota Fanning -this kid is just one of the most impressive young actors ever-) . Putting aside the ideology of the film (pretty fascist and violent, just like 'Dirty Harry', 'Lethal Weapon', and stuff like that), what we have here is a rather commercial picture directed by the man who made 'classics' such as 'Top Gun' or 'Days Of Thunder', nice filmed action, with bad constructed characters (what the hell is going' on with Washintong's character? Why has he ended up like that? Maybe I missed something...). As usual in this kind of artifacts the Americans are the good guys, and the mexicans-russians-whatever are pretty pretty bad guys so unscrupulous... OK let's give it a 6.5/10",7,1,3,6 October 2005
Downfall," Bruno Ganz IS Hitler!!
","We all tend to label as 'unhuman' everything that's cruel and evil. We always want to make the genocides look like beasts when the truth is that there's nothing more human that the hatred, the sadism, the anger, the thirst for revenge... It's OK, it's only a way to protect ourselves against the idea of someone like us doing such horrible things. But don't you fool yourselves: there are no beasts with capacity for the humiliation and the annihilation but the Homo Sapiens.This movie, 'Der Untergang' (the last days of Hitler in his Berlin bunker among his closest friends and politicians), was not welcomed by German audiences. There are too many bruises that haven't being healed yet. A movie showing Hitler suffering just like everyone else? The Führer acting like a gentleman in front of his personal secretary and taking good care of Goebbels' children? There are too many people that don't want to see such things. Hitler was a monster, he wasn't even human! He couldn't have a heart, he couldn't have loved anyone! Well, Oliver Hirsbiegel (the director of the irregular 'Das Experiment') makes clear that the Emperor of the Third Reich was no madman (clinically); he loved Eva Braun, and he suffered in his last days just like everyone whose plans are crumbling down would have suffered (Ok, some plan to build a house in the seaside, some plan to invade Poland... plans, after all).We watch everything that's going' on in the Berlin underground through the eyes of Miss Junge, the personal Hitler's assistant, one of the few witnesses of those last hours. We can smell the sweat, we can feel the humidity, the terror that Hitler provoked in most of his subordinates, the chaos inside and outside the shelter, the hysterical laughing of those who know that are going to die soon. The portrait of the different personalities there is just superb: Eva Braun, THE lover, living in her world of fantasy; she just wants one more drink and one last dance. Mrs. Goebbels, maybe one of the most terrifying in the history of cinema (and what's not cinema), she seems to be even more extreme that Hitler himself. Those generals afraid of contradicting the Fuhrer, who still waits for some squadron to come and defeat the enemy. Outside, Berlin is on fire. The Russians, which had been invaded a few months before, now they are the invaders and they're gonna get into the centre of the Presedential Palace. So, this movie is bigger than life. The script and the the artistic direction are just perfect... nothing!! Nothing compared with Bruno Ganz's work He has brought Hitler to life (and I really mean it). A millimetric job, so blended, never falling in the parody. How to play a character whose histrionism and personality goes beyond any kind of limits? Well, Mr. Ganz has the answer to that. The rest of the cast is also outstanding, but Ganz is the genius here. 'Der Untergang: Hitler und das Ende des 3. Reichs', one the best movie ever done about the Holocaust? And without Jews? Well, it looks like, my friends.*My rate: 10/10",10,2,5,22 November 2005
Bram Stoker's Dracula," (almost) Bram Stoker's
","This is supposed to be the most exact adaptation of Bram Stoker's masterpiece, and there's no doubt that Coppola's 'Dracula' has much more to do with the novel than Todd Browning's, Terence Fisher's, Murnau's, Herzog's, or any of the most remarkable films about the Nosferatu... I supposed it was Coppola's aim to do it that way. So, why did he make up that love-story between Dracula and Mina Harker? There's no such thing in the novel. Did he do that in order to make his film more commercial? Was it a Hollywood imposition? I assume that it is impossible to recreate chapter by chapter that great novel (they'd need to make a 5 or 6 hour long movie), but you can't add things to such a masterpiece. I mean, are you making an adaptation or are you not? Browning or Fisher didn't called their movies 'Bram Stoker's Dracula', because they knew their movies hadn't nothing to do with the novel; and I think Coppola's shouldn't have called his Dracula as Bram Stoker's. OK, once I've make clear that this is not an EXACT adaptation of the story let's talk about the movie itself: Coppola made an outstanding job with the technical part, the photography is just perfect, the colours, the shadows, the atmospheres, the special effects... The movie has such rhythm (except for those scenes that develop Dracula and Mina's lovestory, which are rather hackneyed and sickly), and they made a nice job with the script (Dracula is a novel based on diaries, letters, etc. so it was not easy to convert that into a cinema script). These are the good things about Coppola's adaptation. Now the bad things: again, that love story; the character of Van Helsing is much more rude and reckless than Stoker's creation (although Anthony Hopkins plays it in the best possible way); the characters of Quincey, Seward, and Goldmig aren't properly developed, also they failed to recreate the love and the friendship among those characters... and last, but not least, I don't like the work of Winona Ryder (her performance is such ridiculous in some scene such as that one beneath Dracula's castle) nor Keanu Reeves' (couldn't he be a little more expressionless???). PS: Maybe I'm being too harsh judging those things in relation to the novel adaptation (the characters, the mistakes...), but Dracula is one of my favourite novels ever, so I can't be very tolerant about it :D.My rate: 7/10",7,0,2,19 October 2004
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," Now this looks more like a Lucas' film...
","The most expected chapter of the new trilogy. The only one which really contributes interesting answers. Or should I say THE ANSWER? I mean, how and why Anakin Skywalker went over the dark side and became Lord Vader. 'Revenge of the Sith' is by far the best movie of the new generation of SW episodes. Christensen looks like he's matured (even though I still think that this character is too much for him).The story of SW3 is darker and has much more dramatic weight than the previous episodes. This time we DO have a true evil character (Sidious), and that's essential. In short, if you ask me 'Revenge Of The Sith' is the closest to Star Wars' original spirit, though it will never get close enough. Let's just congratulate George Lucas for finishing the work of his life.*My rate: 7/10",7,0,0,31 December 2005
The Terminal," Tom Hanks, THE MAN!
","An extraordinary real story (a man trapped in an American airport because of some absurd bureaucratic troubles) turned into sort of a romantic comedy rather unimportant. Quite funny and so tender. That's Spielberg! That's Hollywood! Steven runs away from any kind of social-politic commitment and he focuses on giving the audience just what they want: some smiles, some tears, nothing too deep...Tom Hanks takes the whole movie over. He shows off his huge talent playing the main role, a character that's in every single frame of 'The Terminal'. HE IS THE MOVIE.So, what we got here is a perfect made movie where everything it's been so well cared (we're talking about a Spielberg production). Nice for a Saturday afternoon (although we expected something else from the man who made Jaws, AI or ET).*My rate: 7/10",7,1,2,18 October 2005
Before Sunrise," Romanticism and philosophy.
","The perfect love story: two strangers, an American guy and a french girl, they both meet in a train and they decide to spend together one single night in Vienna (after that they'll have to split up forever). Walking around that monumental city, chats about anything, poetry, wine, sex under the light of the stars. Kind of a mix between 'Brief Encounter' and Rohmer's 'Tales of the four seasons'. It is a simple movie, with such an existentialist touch, which leans on the naturalness of Delpi and Hawke, and the chemistry between them. 'Before sunrise' is a good example of how to make a romantic movie without being sickly sweet.*My rate: 7/10",7,1,4,1 February 2006
Heat," Pacino vs. De Niro
","There's one reason (among some others) to watch 'Heat': it is the only movie in which you'll have the opportunity of witnessing a scene with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino together (they both were in Godfather Part II, but they didn't run into each other in any of the scenes). That's hot enough! But there's more: there's Michael Mann, who's an almost 100% reliable director, we got big sophisticated hold-ups (I love those!), we got action, tension, rhythm, and a well-cared production.Along with De Niro and Pacino there they are Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer (pretty sober, what's not usual in him), Ashley Judd, and a nice secondary cast.One of the best detectives-action movies from the 90's, and one of the last good movies in which De Niro took part before he began to get his curriculum vitae full of trash.PD: I would've preferred a different ending.*My rate: 8/10",8,0,2,22 June 2005
Apollo 13," God bless Americans!!
","If you sit down to watch a Ron Howard movie you know exactly what's gonna show up in the screen: good and healthy Americans doing things that are so incredible and so heroic. Howard is a demagogue, he's rather predictable and knows just what the masses want. He always have a big budget, nice actors, and he knows how to shoot so at least his movies are entertaining. And so it is 'Apollo XIII', the odyssey of three astronauts whose spaceship breaks down and leaves them stranded in the space.At the end of 'Apollo XIII' you'll be proud of being American, even if you're not!! Welcome to the wonderful, wonderful life of Ronnie Howard.*My rate: 6/10",6,15,51,18 August 2006
Sin City," A circus of blood, punches and revenge...
","This may be the most explicitly violent movie of the last years (at least it is one of the most violent that I've watched lately). We could discuss about violence in cinema, if it's permissible or it's not; but let's do that in other forums. Let's talk about the film, that's what we're here for, aren't we? 'Sin City' is visually spectacular, that fusion of film-noir, ultra violence and comic is pretty original and so shocking. Maybe all those voices over can get on your nerves, but the fact is that the movie lasts over 120 minutes and you don't get bored at any moment at all. It's been constructed by several parallel stories and even though you don't have any clue about the characters (I have never read those comics) you'll get hooked on the screen.I wouldn't let any child to get closer to this artifact (no way!), and it is definitely no good for those that are sensitive and easily impressionable... for the rest of you (of us), it is just a big fat circus of blood, punches and revenge.Oh, I forgot: what a cast!!*My rate: 7/10",7,0,2,12 January 2006
Braveheart," The Passion Of William Wallace
","Mel Gibson won a couple of Oscars with this super production which recreates the battles between England and Scotland in the Middle Age and the life-story of one of the Scottish leaders: William Wallace (Mel Gibson, of course). I won't deny that 'Braveheart' is just spectacular, and the battle sequences are so exciting (they did a great work there), but did this movie REALLY deserve all those prizes? Well, it is kinda grandiloquent (those images filmed from 2 or 3 helicopters of Wallace on the top of a mountain!! It reminded me of those excessive clips from Guns N'Roses), demagogic, and Gibson's character seems to be a premonition of that long-suffering Jesus Christ from 'The Passion'. Anyway, though it isn't as important as 'Spartacus' or 'Ran' (two of the best battle-related movies of all time) it certainly has some appeal, and you don't get bored even though the movie length is up to 3 hours.PD: Scottish landscapes are just amazing.*My rate: 7/10",7,0,3,22 June 2005
Cinderella Man," A nice movie about boxing...
","Ron Howard, the chronicler of the American Dream, the man who loves the happy endings with hurrays and violins strikes back with a new biopic (after 'A Beautiful Mind', based on the life-story of John Nash), with a new story of long-suffering people who eventually get a well deserved reward. Well, who's the chosen one this time? It is Jim Braddock, a second rate boxer that won the Heavy Weights title in the years of the Great Depression. That way he became kind of a symbol for all the helpless people that were having a real bad time in those days.'Cinderella man' have such a nice setting and an awesome production, the ones only the big Hollywood studios can provide. The boxing sequences are rather realistic (this is not 'Rocky', the fighters don't punch in the nose each other 200 times by round), and the recreation of sweaty and filthy boxing world is superb (it will satisfy even the more fussy). Anyway, there's not much to say about boxing, there are hundreds of movies which talk about that sport.Russel Crowe plays Jim Braddock and he makes an awesome show of strength and charisma, he'll probably won the Oscar (that would be his second one, and his fifth nomination in 6 or 7 years). Renee Zelweeger plays the so loving and sympathetic wife of Braddock's. This woman looks like she's got rooted in Bridget Jones' character (please, no more pouting!!!), maybe with 30kg under. And last (but not least) we got Paul Giamatti, one of the actors of the moment. He plays Braddock's best friend and unselfish manager, and he plays it just brilliantly (he should win an Oscar as well).In short: a new Ronnie Howard's hit, a good film that belongs to a genre which has been so mistreated there in Tinseltown. It is not as good as 'Raging Bull' or 'Fat city', but it's surely worth watching.... oh, and God bless America! *My rate: 7.5/10",8,3,4,28 January 2006

Whatever, the colours, all those mythical scenes, 'Over the rainbow'... It's a classic and that's that! I don't like musicals, I've never understood those movies in which the characters begin to sing with no reason, but 'Wizard of Oz' is an exception, as well as 'Willy Wonka' or 'The Rocky Horror Picture ShoW'WE'RE Going' TO SEE THE WIZARD!!!PD: Can anyone tell me which one was the very first color movie??+My rate: 8/10",8,3,4,27 September 2006

","There are two kinds of movies that are based on superheroes or comics: those ones which put the story behind all kind of digital effects and stuff, and those others that use the effects only to empathize the story. 'V' belongs to that second group of movies. This is not the best moment to deal with terrorism and anarchism, but that what the hero in 'V' does and it is a shaking experience. The cast is full of some of the best Britanic actors of the last decades (Rea, Hurt, FryÂ…), and Natalie Portman makes a nice job (it seems like sh'es leaving behind her image of 'good girl'), she's just given everything she got.
