The Blair Witch Project," Still enjoyable
","I saw this movie again and I still found it rather creepy. It's not a conventional horror movie and it shouldn't be judged as such. It's more an experiment in filmmaking. I didn't follow all the hype or visit the Web site prior to its release, so I didn't have any expectations. I think that helped me to appreciate it on its own terms.I'm still not sure if the actors were really acting or what was real in the movie. Frankly, I don't care. It all looked and felt pretty believable to me...and Heather's scream is something you can't get out of your head too quickly. Too many horror movies today rely on tired conventions; it's nice to see a movie that dares to be different.You can't compare that movie to, or place it in the same catagory as, ones like The Exorist or Psycho. Those movies were made in a very conventional style, using tools like music and camera movement to create fear and terror. Blair Witch had no background music and no camera technique to do its work. And it didn't have a pay-off at the end. For most people, it was just too experimental. For me, that was precisely why I liked it.",Null,0,1,13 July 2003
