Blade Runner 2049," Exellent!
","I'd give 10/10 but then it have to be better than the original.
Absolutely convincing sequel, i't stay'd true to the original and have to admire how they could keep the same feeling and touch trough the film as the first one.
Original is of course legendary, this a suitable and acceptable sequel.",9,1,10,29 July 2018
