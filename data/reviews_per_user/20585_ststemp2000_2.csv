Catch Me If You Can," Light-Hearted, Classy and Fun
","This is a nice change of pace from Spielberg's brooding movies of late. Although the DiCaprio's character has no shortage of dark issues to deal with, he spends most of the film enjoying everything sixties America has to offer, and we're along for the ride.  The film is fast-paced and clever. I'd compare it to the recent remake of The Thomas Crown Affair.",8,0,1,17 February 2003
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Good, but not great
","For whatever reason I didn't enjoy this film as much as I did the first one. I think it is because the narrative of this movie felt more linear; almost like a video game.  There was little that the characters did that seemed as if it had a direct effect on the events that were occuring around them. I.e., they were reactive rather than proactive.  In the first film so many strong decisions were made; in this one they just go out and kick butt. Everyone's talking about Golem's performance which certainly raises the bar for CGI, and please don't misunderstand...it was a cool movie to watch. But not quite as engaging as the first.",8,0,0,17 February 2003
