Men in Black 3," A fun ride
","I wasn't prepared to like MIB3 nearly as much as I did; it's a rare third installment that delivers, and this one does. It's a much more intimate movie than the first two, focusing heavily on the relationship between agents J & K, and the origin of it. The special effects are seamless as always, not over- the-top. The scenes on top of the Empire State Building were very well done. One quibble; why is that prop & set designers seemingly think everything in the future glows blue? I thought I was watching Defiance again. The plot isn't complex, just the usual threat to the survival of the planet, but this go-round time travel is needed to save the world. Throw in a couple of well done fight scenes & chases, the redoubtable Emma Thompson (who has never looked better,) Alice Eve, Bill Hader, a poignant ending, the first moon landing launch, and it's a well-crafted bit of fun worthy of exec producer Steven Spielberg.",9,1,3,18 September 2013
