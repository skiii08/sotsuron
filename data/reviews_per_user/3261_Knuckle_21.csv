The Blair Witch Project," One of the best
","This movie is one of the best horror movies ever made, as well as a welcome departure from the recent rash of self-effacing, teen-oriented, 'funny' horror movies.  The whole movie gives you an eerie feeling that what you are watching is real; that you are right there with them in the woods.  Then, as their situation gets worse and worse you are sucked down with them.  The last five minutes of this movie are incredibly haunting.  Of course words cannot describe just how creepy the entire thing is: It must be seen to be believed.",10,1,2,27 June 1999
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," For those of you who missed out on Andy Kaufman...
","Except that Andy Kaufman was a truly brilliant comedian - Sacha Cohen is merely an imitative cretin without the talent or imagination to make his mark on the world of comedy in any meaningful way. It's true that Andy Kaufman's comedy often made its audience uncomfortable (Tony Clifton, anyone?)but what separates Kaufman's routines from this crap is that it did not make discomfort its sole source of comedy. This fine, but important, distinction between the two men is what separates the geniuses from the mewling pukes who exemplify the worst of 'reality' based entertainment.In this fantastically horrible pile of trash, Cohen's alter-ego Borat buffoons his way across America and gets those wonderfully credulous everymen to join in making asses of themselves. Borat is not funny enough to sustain an entire film, so what cheaper way is there to pad a meaningless waste of time than to film regular joes acting stupid? He might have tried writing some decent material, but not everyone is cut out for that line of work, lacking either the talent, intelligence or humor to do so. Sure, sure, I've heard the arguments that by parading about as Borat, and getting regular folks to speak what's really on their minds, Sacha Cohen is exposing anti-Semitism in everyday life, but he does it by lampooning the Kazakhstani people in a way that can best be described as ignorant and bigoted. In fact, if this movie were directed at Jews, it would be declared to be the most objectionable movie to hit the screen since Birth of a Nation.Even if you ignore the fact that this movie is mean-spirited, ignorant, xenophobic, and imitative, the bottom line is that it also is just not very funny either.1 out of 10.",1,12,26,21 November 2006
Underworld," Not real imaginative or good
","Essentially this is a Romeo and Juliette story with vampires and werewolves (imaginatively rechristened 'death dealers' and 'lycans')and they use guns instead of swords. The vampires are still dressed like leather bar hookers and the werewolves, excuse me, 'lycans', look like homeless derelicts on steroids - 'urban feral' if you will.For some reason, vampire clans always seem to lounge about in palatial, Gothic mansions and sip wine or blood or what the hell ever, and just generally do their best to impersonate French nobility with their idle chic. These vampires are no different, despite the fact that there is a rabid army of computer generated dog-men out there wanting to tear them to ribbons. One vampire, played by Kate Beckinsale, (I'm tempted to call her 'The Littlest Death Dealer') sees that an eternal life of posing awkwardly on baroque furniture is going to get them all killed for good and does her best to warn the predictably disinterested elder of her clan that something bad is about to happen.One, two, skip a few, there's some twists and turns, people get betrayed, love is found, blah, blah, blah.All in all, the whole thing is uninspired. The art direction is stereotypical. You've seen the Gothic mansions, the gooey sewers, so forth and so on before and better in other movies. The acting is not horrible, but how good does it have to be when all the actors do is howl or bare their fake looking fangs? The action scenes - typical MTV, quick edit, see nothing sequences. The wire work is laughably bad and should really be accompanied by a badly synched dub-track. The direction is a pitiful mess. While Len Wiseman may have been trying to capture the dark, Gothic feel of the Underworld, I think he probably should have listened to his cinematographer when the gentleman said, 'We're gonna need more lights.' Of course, maybe Len was hoping that if we didn't see anything, we wouldn't realize just how bad it is.I give it 2 out of 10, because the ten year old inside of me keeps chanting, 'But vampire fighting werewolves is COOL!' Maybe, but this movie isn't.",2,3,9,31 March 2006
Finding Nemo," Pixar does it again!
","Finding Nemo, like its Pixar generated predecessors, is a joy to watch from start to finish.  Full of breath taking underwater vistas, only the talking fish clue you in to the fact that this is not a nature documentary. The writing is superb.  The story is engaging and the humor is of the rare variety that can entertain both adults and children without insulting either group's intelligence.  Pixar proves, without resorting to gratuitous depictions of sex and violence (like much of Japanese anime), that cartoons are not just for children. Ellen DeGeneres steals the show as Dory - a fish afflicted with short-term memory loss.  While generally a humorous character, her moments of drama are truly heart-breaking.  Her performance is Oscar-worthy. Five out of five stars.",Null,0,1,28 July 2003
Crash," Wow - was that overrated or what?
","I'm sorry, but for all the hoopla surrounding this movie, I expected more than what I got, which was nothing more than a drive-by shooting of liberal white male guilt.The dialogue was always just a little too sharp and polished, more real than real as Tyrell said in 'Blade Runner.' Every line just dripped meaning and impact, every bit of film was a money shot of sociopolitical commentary. Oh, and every character was a stark raving bore.And it's not that I want to come off as some sort of Pat O'Reilly worshipper, because I'm the furthest thing from that - but come on, can we get any more hamfisted and heavy with the social commentary than saying racism and intolerance is bad? If Hagis had thrown in a biting and pointed protest against land mines and rape, he'd have batted a perfect 1000 in the ball game of preaching to the choir.This movie was incredibly tedious - the cinematic version of confession. And it's not even like the sins committed were all that grotesque. 'Forgive me father, for I have sinned. Today I woke up and I was still rich and white and I just wish I could do something for all of those poor, poor minorities who wish they were like me!' 'Make a movie my son and bore the living hell out of every viewer out there and all will be forgiven.' Paul Haggis - if you ever read this: Get over yourself. It's nothing more than a sophomoric jab at a problem that was grossly misrepresented by a liberal mind too set in its preconceptions of what is wrong to actually get the problem stated right in the first place.",1,11,21,13 March 2006
Nacho Libre," It's not racist, it's just not funny
","Wow. Jared Hess is a modern day alchemist, having turned Jack Black's comedic gold into cinematic lead. In a continuation of his hump-a-single-note series, Jared Hess takes the wild and wacky world of Mexican wrestling and lampoons it for about an hour and a half too long.In what Jared Hess must have considered to be a 'high concept,' Jack Black plays a monk in a monastery who turns to Mexican wrestling in order to raise money for an orphanage. It sounds slightly more interesting than a feeb trying to get his friend elected class president, but this movie turns out to be about as watchable (which is to say, not at all) as Napoleon Dynamite.With predictable set ups and punchlines, there is nothing at all to make this movie worthwhile. There's a lot of jokes about the outrageousness of wrestlers, some lame crap about how to prepare to become a wrestler, and some really stale jokes about tight clothes on men. Unfortunately for Jared, if you've been through the sixth grade, you've heard all of these jokes a long time ago - and they weren't funny then, either.So forget all of the nonsense you've heard about this movie being culturally insensitive and concentrate on what really matters - it's just a plain, old bad movie executed by men and women who should have been told 'no' during pre-pre-pre production.",1,7,16,22 November 2006
Lost in Translation," More Dabbling From Sofia Coppola
","First she under-whelmed us with her writer's abilities with 'Life Without Zoe.' Then she added just a right amount of awful to Godfather III with her truly wooden acting. Now, having dabbled in everything else entertainment related, she dons the director's hat in some sort of vain hope that she will have found her calling - or at least something she doesn't completely suck at.Scarlett Johansson, in the 'I'm really not based on not Sofia Coppola, *wink wink*' role stars as Charlotte, a poor, ignored wife who has been all but kidnapped to Japan by her neglectful husband on his latest business trip to Japan. Surrounded by an island full of those inscrutable, shifty, swapping L's for R's, Japanese, she finds herself alienated in deluxe accommodations that must be costing her husband's employers more than most of us make in a year.Throw into the mix, Bill Murray as Bob Harris, a burned out has-been who sleepwalks through his latest gig - a Japanese whiskey commercial, because he probably thinks he should be doing Shakespeare - and probably for a white audience at that.The two meet and while the sparks obviously don't fly, they take joy in each other's misery, mutual isolation in the world's most populace island, and their asinine observations that the Japanese can't pronounce their R's properly - ignoring the fact of course, that neither one of them can speak a lick of Japanes. Typical dumb ass American tourists.Aside from the generic xenophobic swipes, Sofia Coppola, who also wrote this (if it can be said to have a story at all) sprinkles the story with every cliché possible in an attempt to make her characters seem less like the whiny, bitchy, cry babies they are. At one point Charlotte begs her husband to 'just skip today.' We're supposed to tut-tut with disapproval as he tells her he can't, but given that this photography gig is only a few weeks, it would be the equivalent of one of us skipping out on, oh, a month of work. I think we can forgive him for not acceding to his needy wife's wishes.The story goes nowhere as it chronicles the journeys of Charlotte and Bob. If this movie had been made by someone else, ANYONE else, it would have been completely missed. As is, with the Coppola name, it has garnered accolades from every hipster doofus wishing for another Great Movie Dynasty. Sorry,but Sofia Coppola falls short in her foray as a director, too. I will grant her that the movie is full of some positively beautiful images,but maybe next time she'll cut to the chase and just publish a picture book instead.",2,2,6,12 August 2005
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," Anakin... need I say more?
","First off SPOILER WARNING.  If you've been living under a rock for the past all-of-your-life, then read no further.You mean to tell me that this whiny little twerp is the future scourge-of-the-universe, six-feet-plus-of-black-and-mean, Mr. 'You Jedi Are All Dead Men Walking' Darth Vader Dark Lord of the Sith himself?  Anakin's rage is akin to that of a twelve-year old whose favorite Elf just got eaten by a rock troll in D&D.Great, yet another childhood myth washed down the drain... instead of assuming Vader was evil incarnate, we now know his turning to the Darkside was the result of traumatic potty training.",2,0,1,4 December 2002
The Matrix Revolutions," Not as bad as they say...
","But then of course, neither is getting your teeth cleaned.The Matrix Revolutions is entertaining in spots but falls flat on its back whenever it attempts to be philosophical or meaningful in any shape, form, or fashion.  Keep an eye out for Mifune (the APU captain) - he's easily one of the brightest spots in this movie.  Agent Smith, as always, is great fun to watch.  Trinity and Morpheus are cool, too.  In fact, almost everyone in this movie overshadows Neo, its very bland, very predictable messiah.4 out of 10.",2,0,0,19 November 2003
Apocalypse Now," Apocalypse Now Redux a.k.a Let's Make Some More Money!
","Francis Ford Coppola was at one time a filmmaking genius.  Now, like many of the 1970s icons, he has devolved into a pale shadow of his former self. With such movies as 'Jack' and the reprehensible third 'Godfather' movie, it was merely a matter of time before he went back to material from his glory days, dusted it off, added scenes that had been wisely edited out in the first place, and declared to the world 'I am back!'Sadly, such is not the case.  The footage added to 'Apocalypse Now Redux' detract from the movie, stopping its narrative cold (as in the French plantation scene) or changing what was once a brilliant scene into farsical nonsense (as in the added footage that changes Col. Kilgore from a man who is worryingly in love with his work to a simpleton-surfer.)It is a worrying trend that nowadays directors feel the urge to go back and re-cut, re-master, re-edit, re-do their previous works.  In an Orwellian power trip, it seems that these directors not only want us to forget the shortcomings (if they ever existed) in their prior films, but they also see to it that those who wish to remember are not able to do so by making sure that the 'new and improved' versions are the only ones available.",Null,0,0,12 December 2001
Van Helsing," Sommers oversteps his boundaries
","Van Helsing is called upon by the Vatican to kill Count Dracula. Along the way he meets Frankenstein's monster and other assorted critters in a big old homage to every single 'Monster A' meets 'Monster B' movie ever made.The problem is, when the wolfman met the mummy, it was a B-movie back then and it's a B-movie now. Add to that the fact that Stephen Sommers is not a very good director and an even worse writer and what you have is a story that would struggle to make it as a comic book much less as a feature-length movie.All throughout this misadventure into stupidity, Sommers tries to imbue his characters with personality and the story with some meaning. He fails on both counts. He wants to entertain us (I'm assuming) but instead winds up wasting about two hours of our time.Hugh Jackman does his best, but every line he is given is such a clunker that no matter how much you want to like him or his character, you just can't. Kate Beckinsale once again proves why she should never be allowed in front of a camera - every time she lays that horrible accent on us, you just want Dracula to rip her throat open so we can be done with her.Except that if he did, she'd turn into one of those hideous CGI critters that someone, somewhere mistakenly thought would be a good idea.This movie is a convoluted, idiotic mess designed to sell toys and rip our movie-going dollars from our pockets. Don't waste your time.",2,10,21,8 April 2006
Being John Malkovich," Fairly Overrated
","'Being John Malkovich' is probably one of the most overrated films this year.  Hailed as 'unique' and 'visionary' it is a so-so creation with more fluff than substance.  The flashy use of 'edgy' camera work coupled with the over-indulgence of the 'odd' and lack of character development makes this film one big questiion mark.  'Who are these people?' 'What makes them tick?' And 'Why should I care?' This is not to say the movie was horrible, completely without merit.  To be fair, Charlie Sheen was hilarious and the chimp, at one point, steals the show.  No, this movie wasn't horrible, it was mediocre with enough offbeat elements to fool the moviegoing audience into thinking they had seen something truly creative.",Null,0,0,3 January 2000
Alien vs. Predator," Bad, bad, bad, and more bad
","SPOILER ALERT(Not that there is much of a plot to be revealed...)What better way to make a whole ton of money than to take two franchises that have completely worn out their entertainment value and combine them to form a completely unwatchable movie?In Aliens vs. Predator, the writers, producers, and director have managed to make an action/adventure/sci-fi movie almost totally devoid of any redeeming qualities. The small in-jokes sprinkled throughout the movie are the only things worth watching and they amount to roughly twelve seconds of viewing time.Mr. Weyland (a robotics expert whose middle name is Bishop - get it?) assembles a crack team of archaeologists, geologists, miners, and oh, blood thirsty mercenaries, to go after some Incan/Mayan/Cambodian temple buried in the Arctic ice so that he can leave something of importance behind - namely the knowledge that there is an ugly old building in some dark, cold cave. Despite the fact that the filmmakers wasted twenty to thirty minutes of our time trying to give these idiots motivation and character, the protagonists are one dimensional props sent into an unbelievably contrived situation for the express purpose of getting caught in the middle of a cosmic car wreck and so you don't feel the least bit sorry when the crap hits the fan and they all start to get eaten. Of course, the interior of the Predator's house o' fun is so poorly lit that we don't even get the satisfaction of seeing these non-people getting obliterated.Watching this movie and coming out disappointed is like taking a huge bite out of a turd sandwich and wondering why it didn't taste good.",Null,0,1,12 September 2004
Batman Begins," Not perfect, but the best so far
","Others have already touched upon its 'dark, gritty' atmosphere, the wonderful performances by Bale, Oldman, Neeson, and Freeman, so I'll move on to the things that made this film far less than what it should have been... or, to put it more aptly, the sole item that made me want to vomit.The character of Rachel Dawes (played by Katie Holmes) was perhaps the laziest attempt at including a female lead in any film in recent times. The character was a demanding, ball-busting harridan without an ounce of understanding or empathy. She was self-centered, shallow, and the very definition of a waste of screen time.First she slaps Bruce Wayne for bringing a gun to Joe Chill's hearing, accusing him of cowardice... conveniently ignoring the fact that (a) he didn't have to show her the gun, (b) he didn't shoot Chill, and (c) this is the man who has spent the past decade-plus living in abject guilt and horror over his role in his parents' death and obviously has some issues.Then, when she sees him in his playboy persona, he tries to tell her that this is not who he is. Her response? A very shallow 'it's not who you are inside, it's what you do.' She never even once considered the possibility that there was a method to his madness.And THEN when he does act, she informs him that, in a nutshell, it isn't how SHE wanted him to act and therefore cannot be with him until he magically changes himself back into the boy he was before his parents were brutally gunned down before his very eyes.Her 'moment' at the end was straight out of 'Spider-Man.' A horribly-xeroxed instance of 'I love you, but can't be with you' meant to make the viewing audience really FEEL Bruce Wayne's loss and isolation. Personally, I felt that Wayne should have broken out the champagne at her declaration that she wanted nothing to do with him. Lame, lame, lame.Yes, the character of Rachel Dawes was that bad... bad enough to make an otherwise A-grade film a B-minus effort. Next time? Some advice for the writers here: Avoid imitating Spider-Man too much, okay? Mary Jane is an integral part of the Spider-Man mythos. I've never even heard of Rachel Dawes. Everything that she was in that film could have been accomplished by James Gordon or left out entirely.",8,0,1,25 June 2005
28 Days Later...," A tad overrated
","POSSIBLE SPOILERS From the hype and gushes over this film, one would expect way more than one gets out of 28 DAYS LATER. Starting out bleak and hopeless, the film devolves into your standard British tirade against any and all authority figures coupled with some moments that are more 'Rambo' than 'Dawn of the Dead.' While having zombiedom achieved through a virus is an interesting take on the zombie genre, what wasn't so novel was how, predictably enough, the soldiers (ie, the 'bad men with guns') are the real threat. Seems that four weeks without female contact is enough to turn these British soldiers into thuggish brutes hell-bent on raping the first women that come across their paths, namely, the film's heroines.There were a few tense moments and some bits that made me jump, but for the most part, the over-indulgent logic made this film an exercise in debunking than a trip through a hellish world of what if. And given that the Rage victims could be brought down by one good hit anywhere it hurt, one can't help but think that the problems afflicting the heroes in this film might have been rendered moot by a large shotgun or two.Silly, tepid, and overrated. Has some good effects, but those can't hide the lack of story, logic, or character development.",4,25,47,26 March 2005
Taken," Surprisingly Smart Action Film
","Liam Neeson delivers an excellent performance in this movie, giving us a cold, calculating intelligence agent and loving father without resorting to any sort of hackneyed acting tricks. The script, likewise, avoids such obvious displays of his hard edge, like kicking a puppy or something like that.The main story is taken straight from the headlines, and while it may or may not be accurate in its details, it does give us something to rally behind and so we don't mind that Neeson resorts to trickery and outright brutality in his quest to find his daughter. Some might call it pandering, but since scumbag slavers do exist in real life, I don't mind being pandered to here.The action sequences, while a little too quick with the editing, show a lot of thought. Neeson uses whatever is at his disposal to end the fight quickly and there are no idiotic quips or comments. He's there to do a job and talking just gets in the way.Top notch effort from all involved and certainly the best movie to come out of Luc Besson in a while.This movie is well worth watching on the big screen.",8,1,4,8 February 2009
The Mummy Returns," Why is Sommers still making movies?
","As fatuous as the first Mummy movie was, it had a certain goofy charm to it. The characters were marginally likable and a few scenes here and there made me chuckle.The sequel, however, is a monstrosity. It lacks all the cleverness and innocent goodwill of the first movie, which leads me to believe the rumors I hear that a) the first movie benefited from massive uncredited rewrites and b) the same ghost writers left Sommers to his own devices for the second after getting shafted on credit for the first movie.So here we have it, a clear portrait of Stephen Sommers' film-making abilities and they are meager. As a writer he gives us some real gems of dialog. You know that any movie that has a kid say, 'My dad's gonna kick you a**,' is going to be a real stinker. The rub in this situation comes when you realize that it's the best line in the movie.CGI effects dominate this movie and they are bad. Everything from the midget mummies to the flying boat zeppelin looks fake and stupid.Don't waste your time. This movie was a monumental waste of time and money.1 out of 10.",1,7,13,8 April 2006
Grindhouse," Manufactured, Processed Cult
","Grindhouse is a fine example of what one can do with a name, some marketing, and absolutely no talent or thought.Tarantino and Rodriguez, unable or unwilling to devise a compelling or entertaining story, insulated themselves from all criticism by deliberately setting out to make a campy movie - If you dislike it, then you just didn't get it. The B-movies (God only knows what doof came up with the phrase 'Grindhouse') used to be a product of their limitations in budget and time. In that respect, Grindhouse is just a little bit different, being a product of their writer/directors' creative limitations.Camp films didn't cost over twenty-million dollars to make. They also didn't have tens of millions of dollars in marketing. They also had a tendency to be entertaining (if accidentally) which is the one thing this movie (or movies) isn't.'Grindhouse' is a fantastic movie, if acting, story, dialog, and entertainment value don't count.",1,7,14,15 January 2008
300," Not Historically Accurate, but who cares?
","Okay, so 300 isn't going to win any awards for historical accuracy, or even for stellar writing or acting. It's a movie meant to show how a handful of Spartans marched to the Hot Gates and made a bloody mess out of the Persian army.And if that's all the filmmakers had done, it would have been a grand action/war movie. It's interesting visually, the fight choreography, while not revolutionary, was entertaining, and the pacing of the movie was fast enough to keep my butt from ever getting numb.But noooooooooooooooooo. They had to try to inject some idiotic story in there about freedom and free men and free men fighting for freedom. Oh, and there's some throw away back story that takes place back in Sparta involving politics and the Queen, and blah, blah, blah.THAT stuff was boring. Mind numbingly so. The previews promised me blood and guts and that's all I wanted to see and all of this politics crap is like lettuce on a burger - a feeble attempt to inject some wholesomeness into a completely, irredeemably unhealthy bundle of fun. I didn't give a rat's rear about the queen, about the politicking she and her Abraham Lincoln-looking ally had to engage in, or any of that and if they'd cut it out wholesale they might have stuffed in another fight scene or two.It's worth seeing on the big screen but might be a more enjoyable experience on DVD since you would be able to skip all those stupid, talking bits.8/10",8,4,10,20 March 2007
Fantastic Four," Good fun entertainment
","I know the current trend in comic book adaptations today is to clad the protagonist/s head-to-toe in black and pull out the thesaurus to see just how many ways they can be described as 'serious.' 'Grim.' 'Gritty.' 'Dark.' 'Hard-edged.' Blah, blah, blah.Well, thank goodness someone had the sense to buck that trend where this film and these characters were concerned. It's The Fantastic Four for crying out loud! Hats off to the filmmakers for remembering that!All the actors turned in stellar performances, but special mention must go to Michael Chiklis as The Thing and Chris Evans as The Human Torch. Both of them did an outstanding job portraying these comic book character legends and their back-and-forth banter was delivered with such precision timing that you actually believed you were watching two friends bicker as opposed to two actors doing their jobs.Jessica Alba could have easily been sidelined as the obligatory pretty face, but The Invisible Girl was well-written and she handed in a performance that was neither aggravatingly passive nor overwhelmingly shrewish - she played the role of exasperated sister and pining lover with subtle perfection.Ioan Gruffud and Julian MacMahon must likewise be credited for turning in performances that didn't scream melodrama. If anything, it looked like they got in front of the camera and enjoyed themselves. And fortunately for all of us, they remembered to include us in the fun.The script did take some liberties with the comic book origin - but these liberties were taken well. Too often a screenplay tries to be faithful to the source material and the writer forgets just one key factor: that comic books are comic books and movies are movies. Their dramatic structure is different and the written word is not the same as the spoken word.The changes, such as they were, were perhaps not the most inspired, creatively-speaking, but neither did they insult the viewer's intelligence.Fan of the comics or not, The Fantastic Four will be a thoroughly enjoyable film to all viewers. The acting, as I said, was A+. The special effects? Superb. The action sequences? Lacked the MTV-type editing that makes my head hurt and were expertly choreographed and well-paced.All in all, see this movie for what it is - a good excuse to sit down and enjoy yourself. That's all it promises and it certainly delivers!",9,15,28,11 July 2005
Sin City," Straight from the comics
","If you discount the sleepwalking actors, the clunky writing, monotonous soundtrack and uninspired camera work, Sin City wasn't all that bad.Three-in-one and not a one of them was in any way anything more than an extended commercial advertising Frank Miller's misogynistic fantasies and Rodriguez's lack of inspiration.I know they were aiming to pay homage to the hardboiled detective noir thrillers of yesteryear, but Orson Welles pulled it off better (and in a shorter time span) than Rodriguez and Co. did. What we have here is all form, no substance.Fans of Miller's comic will likely lose their minds with glee over the fact that every frame, every line, every everything was taken straight from his comic books - heck, I even found myself going 'Hey! That's straight from the original 'Sin City' story in Dark Horse Presents!' But you know what? Slavish attention to detail doesn't pay off when you ignore the big picture. It doesn't matter if Clive Owen's hair looks EXACTLY like Dwight's as Miller drew him if his lines are painful to listen to. Yes, they were taken word-for-word from the comic book, but there is a reason (or three in this movie given the different story lines) why Miller writes for comic books. A monthly serial aimed at a preteen audience in a format where words are read and not heard ahas its limitations... limitations that become all too apparent when the lines that sound tough-as-nails in black-and-white sound so laughably childish when actually read aloud.It's a beautiful movie to look at, the actors looked exactly like their counterparts in the comics, the sets (such as they were) were ingeniously and lovingly crafted - so why do I still feel like I wasted my time? Because movies have evolved beyond ten-second snippets of a man sneezing. Movies are not only the wardrobe and sets and pretty faces. They are, in a perfect world, an all-encompassing experience that give us something to look at, something to listen to, and something to think about.I looked. I listened. But I'll be darned if it gave me anything to think about other than ten different things I'd rather be doing than watching this film.2 out of 10.",2,4,8,4 April 2005
