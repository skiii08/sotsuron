Miracle," What you see is what you get.
","This is a pretty good inspirational reality movie. I think it compares to something like Apollo 13 more than some other sports movies. Russell is great as a low-key, but highly motivated Herb Brooks.I thought the movie was best in the early and middle going. Ironically, the actual 'Miracle game' had very confused game action. The earlier games seemed clearer.Another bigger disappointment was the new play-by-play by Al Michaels. Michaels is actually a pretty good hockey PBP guy because he uses the range in his voice to convey intensity and action. During the live call of the 1980 game (back in 1980) Michael's voice tone said as much as his choice of words. But in the movie, he's so monotone and unenthusiastic that it's a let down. It would have been better to use clips from the ABC broadcast in 1980.Anyway, Miracle is a good values movie for the whole family. The kids won't appreciate the kind of US that existed in the late 70's. They also won't get the elevation of the players from rival individuals to a united, dedicated team. (The underlying message to the citizens of the country is a little too subtly presented to stick.) But some day your kids will understand.",Null,0,0,16 February 2004
50 First Dates," Sandler and Barrymore are a natural pair.
","I have a generally low regard to Adam Sandler's work on SNL and Drew Barrymore is more cute than she is an actress. But once again, these two put together a movie that was fun to watch.When I enjoyed The Wedding Singer I figured it was a fluke. But Dates is even better. The early part seemed like an intended ripoff of Groundhog Day. But then the style and story diverges. Some of the stuff is 'laugh out of control' funny. (But some bits flop and should have been fixed pre-release.)If you hate Sandler and someone tries to get you to see the movie, do it. You might still hate Sandler, but you'll like the movie.",7,0,0,14 February 2004
Minority Report," A very underrated movie.
","First, I'm not a natural Steven Spielberg fan and I'm not a Tom Cruise fan. I usually strongly dislike most of their work.However, Minority Report forces both of them out of their respective safety zones. Cruise was pretty good in Vanilla Sky where he tolerated a total facial destruction as a key part of the plot. Once again, in MR, he's not a afraid to look bad -- emotionally or physically. It's hard to believe this one time smirking 'pretty boy' can be so gritty and he does it convincingly.Spielberg laid an egg with AI, but here he does a good job of convincing you that you are in the year 2054, moreso than more future set movies.The movie has some interesting homage subtleties -- throwback to Kubrick movies and style, for example. And except for a couple of really dumb plot holes, it's pretty tight and unpredictable, even when it's being predictable (which itself should be predictable in a movie about predictions!).I'm usually the first to make the 'too long' complaint, but the movie is trying to say a lot about its characters in the small scale, and also about the social reaction to crime on a larger scale.How far are we willing to go for security? I think that we're constantly trying to balance freedom and security. We often get it wrong -- the WW II imprisonment of Japanese-Americans, overzealous police, unconstitutional detainment of 'persons of interest' regarding terrorism. From hindsight, we usually get it right. Spielberg offers a sense of foresight in this movie. Hopefully, we'll get it right.Enjoy the movie.",9,0,0,4 August 2002
Training Day," Much ado about not much.
","First, I'll state I'm a big fan of Denzel Washington. I really enjoy his movies. That's why this is a bit of a disappointment. I'm very surprised that this got him the Oscar. He's had so many better roles and movies.The movie wanted to be realistic, but the story is unbelievable. There's no way a savvy Alonzo, with so much at risk, would have involved a total wildcard like Jake.Even if you go along the plot, none of the characters are that gripping. I didn't care about anyone in the movie, except for a couple of kids.I'd say 4 out of 10 stars.",Null,32,67,15 September 2002
Unbreakable," Unbearable? Unwatchable?
","With Willis it's either a great movie or a great waste of time. This one will help you get to sleep. In the movie, the characters actually 'undevelop' -- they have more depth and reality at the beginning of the movie than at the end. They start out as recognizable people and end up as comic book characters -- and I don't mean that in a nice way.If you want to watch a movie to see cool use of color and curious camera angles, go for it. If you're one of those folks who like gimmicks like real characters, an interesting story and non-geologic pacing, forget Unbreakable.Try a much better movie -- something like The Sixth Sense.",4,0,1,1 July 2001
Memento," A short comment for the memory challenged...
","This movie is like a book that you pick up and can't put down, can't wait for the ending (middle? beginning?), but you hope that it lasts forever. In the middle of the movie, my wife said 'I have a headache!' and I said, 'Yeah, me too. It's great.'I haven't seen any comments about the humor in the movie. There are lots of amusing bits interwoven into the drama and tension.Oh, and don't forget to return the movie to the video store. Write a note... now before you forget.",9,0,1,20 September 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
","Boooooo-ring.I tried to read the books several times long ago. Too boring. Maybe I just like science fiction more than supernatural fantasy.If you read and liked the books, you should like this movie.

The Insider," Take you time and enjoy this complex story.
","This is fine movie with good acting and directing. Clearly it deserves some of the notoriety it has gotten. There are couple of times where you'd like the story to move more quickly and a couple of dispensable scenes. In addition, there is a myriad of quick-in, quick-out characters which is a little confusing. (What was Rip Torn doing in the movie? Great actor, weak part.) But overall, this is a captivating story about two men. One is an activist, always looking do to the 'right thing' and willing to take risks. The other is more opportunistic, but facing a crisis. He might seek revenge or forgiveness more than he would be a crusader. I'd recommend this with a very large bowl of popcorn and a long evening. BTW, the video I rented was picturebox format: bravo!",Null,0,0,16 April 2000
Paths of Glory," An Officer and a Genius Director
","See this tremendous war movie to understand the meaning of 'vivid', 'taught', 'tense', and 'somber'. Great direction from Kubrick. The visual effects are better than 'All Quiet on the Western Front' and 'Porkchop Hill'. Kubrick really knows how to use a camera. Douglas portrays the classic frustration of a humane officer who not only fights the enemy, but his superiors. This is a 'war movie', not a 'combat movie'. (No Rambo, no Wayne. Just people.)",10,0,0,22 November 1999
Any Given Sunday," Like Jamie, I want to throw up.
","Don't bother reading the long, defensive reviews.This movie is terrible -- classic Oliver Stone over-hyped, over-produced garbage. No redeeming value whatsoever.If you insist on seeing it, get the VCR version so don't need to see as much as the DVD (letterbox) version.",1,0,3,30 September 2000
Thirteen Days," Was I the only one moved to tears by Thirteen Days?
","I'll agree with the other comments about bad accents, great Bobby and John acting, perfect characterization of others (subtitles were unnecessary for me), slightly too long, etc. It's a very good movie and you should see it if you know about history and you _definitely_ should see it if you don't know about history.The thing that surprised me about the movie was that I broke into tears. Despite a personal reputation as a cold cynic, I do get moved by war drama -- the Midway torpedo bomber scene, the Gettysburg climax of Pickett's Charge -- but this was a nearly bloodless movie.I think it was a reminder (or first expression) of the horrible fear and paralyzing helplessness I felt as a 12 year old. I still remember the tone of voice of the teacher who told us to be sure to watch the President on TV that night. I think that's the most fear I had ever heard in an adult's voice. (She didn't know _what_ was wrong, but she sure knew _something_ was seriously wrong.)I would have expected more comments from people roughly the same age about their feelings at the time and how the movie renews those feelings. (I didn't get the same reaction from the excellent Guns of October with William Devane's tremendous John Kennedy with a dead-on accent.) Maybe I didn't cry at the time, but I was very afraid. It was good to release those 39 year old tears.",9,0,0,2 February 2001
Apollo 13," Houston, we have a masterpiece, here.
",Let me start with the ending: the chills from the movie matched the chills I felt while following the real thing.Everyone in the cast is perfect. Even Clint Howard scores as a perfect engineer proxy. Ed Harris carries Gene Kranz's complex personality convincingly. (The movie is about the resourcefulness and dedication of the support team as much as it is a story about astronauts.) The astronaut actors are great -- even the earthbound ones. The technical info didn't need any embellishment and the movie didn't try. The special effects are great (including real zero-g!). Even some well place humor and a great Lovell cameo.This is the kind of movie that The Right Stuff should have been.,Null,0,1,2 October 1999
