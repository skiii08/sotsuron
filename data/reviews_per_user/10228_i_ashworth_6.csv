Ford v Ferrari," Le Mans 66
","... as we prefer to call it in Europe. As refreshing as a nice cuppa tea. Thoroughly human performances against a magnificent and evocative automotive backdrop. A winner, despite the 'suits'!",8,0,1,5 March 2020
Blade Runner 2049," Pretty vacant
","I'm so glad I configured the IMDb ratings from worst first, so that I didn't have to trawl through a welter of positive reviews to get to some sense, seeing that this visually opulent (pretty) yet thoroughly vapid (vacant) film gets an average 8/10 and massive thumbs-up from the likes of The Guardian and Empire. The plotting in this film made no sense whatsoever, and it was interminable. What's so annoying is that anyone who's a fan of the original (and who isn't?) would feel obliged to sit through it. You don't have to go off-world to suffer the pain.",2,6,15,6 January 2019
A Star Is Born," Codswallop... I feel a song coming on
","So much tripe packed into barely an hour (which was when I gave up on it). The girl won't go to the rock star's concert because she's got to go to work. When she gets to work her boss tells her 'You're late' so she quits her job in a huff and leaves the building (with the rocker's chauffeur conveniently waiting for her). That was annoying, but there was so much that was just boring, boring, boring. I preferred Lady Gaga in Desperately Seeking Susan and Bradley Cooper in The Big Lebowski.",1,18,32,9 January 2019
Deadpool 2," Bit of a Brian, this one
","Having thoroughly enjoyed Deadpool, I must say that this outing of DP reminded me of a guy called Brian way back in my university days. He thought he was funny but in fact he was just stupid. Deadpool 2 is Brian.",Null,1,4,30 December 2018
Silent Hill," dire dross
","Please only ever let me have dealings with the people that rated this film as utter codswallop, because anyone who starred it as half decent or above must be on a completely different planet. Without a sun. I gave it a 2 rather than a 1 on account of the special effects, which looked quite good, but to what end? Films like this make civilization seem so pointless. You'd get more out of staring at a cave painting. I'd have enjoyed it more if Sean Bean had stuck with his native Yorkshire accent and told us 'Eeh, by gum, there's nowt so queer as folk'. Or as bad actors, with bad scripts. I'm almost tempted to take back that extra point for fear of misleading anyone into thinking that the effects alone make the film worthy of a viewing.",2,1,4,1 December 2007
Paranormal Activity," Paranormal inactivity
","In films like this your mind wanders. I found myself trying to figure out which comedy troupe came up with the name of the legal outfit: 'Terribly, Terribly, Boring and Dull'. All four of the associates would have been in their element here. I should at this point like to thank the hysterical females just behind my right shoulder who made me jump more than what was happening on screen in the final seconds, which were admittedly pretty spooky but didn't make up for sitting through 90 minutes of a boring no-score draw between two poor teams, to coin a metaphor. The rest of the film is tedium incarnate. How are we supposed to believe in these people? How are they meant to get to sleep after two or three nights of this? Impossible to believe in these poorly sketched characters. Any resemblance with the Blair Witch Project is entirely fortuitous (and a godsend for such a lame movie).",4,5,9,7 December 2009
