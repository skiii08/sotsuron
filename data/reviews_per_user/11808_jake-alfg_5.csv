Scarface," An All-American Masterpiece
","Tony Montana is a self-made man, with no reason not to live life to the fullest. He would be a Randian superman, except for the fact that his flawed religious thinking ultimately gets the better of him. Luckily, the writers showed how destructive that thinking was.Of the entire cast of characters, Montana and his sidekick are the only moral ones. Sadly, it's a tragedy, and the facet of his personality that is religious derangement ultimately is responsible for the tragic deaths of his sister and best friend.Still, it's a great film with a (mostly) righteous protagonist and some great lines.",10,0,2,6 August 2012
In Time," Excellent Movie That is a Direct Allegory to Current Times and Fiat Currency Systems
","The ending is excellent. When Will Salas and Weis's daughter approach the Federal Reserve bank, it's the movie claiming that fiat currency is not real money.This isn't a liberal mealy-mouthed tale of illogical self-sacrificial altruism, it's a tale of rebellion against the state. Moreover, like 'The Matrix' it's a tale that accounts for false 'limited' capitalism, corporatism AKA 'fascism,' 'protectionism,' being pawned off on the working poor as 'capitalism.' Leonard Peikoff and Ayn Rand would be happy with this movie. As I said: the final scene makes the entire movie.When Ayn Rand criticized the 'Robin Hood' meme, she identified the evil element of that meme as 'robbing from the self-made rich to give to the thieving poor.' But she noted that the popular misconception of the story, ignored the injustices perpetrated by the Sheriff of Nottingham.'In Time' identifies those injustices. Where time is money, false money allows its makers and unlimited license to steal. This knowledge permeates the entire movie.Those who are ignorant will see a Robin Hood tale, the opposite of the objectivist ethic. Those who comprehend the ending of 'Atlas Shrugged,' where Galt is offered gold for compensation if he sells out his revolution, will greatly enjoy this movie.",9,0,1,6 August 2012
Blade Runner," A Beautiful Movie
","In its thoughts, ideas, and vision, this is one of the best movies ever made. I don't even mind the narration of the original, because it's done so well. The original and the director's cut are both excellent.In the director's cut, it's more obvious that Deckard is a replicant, which adds to the vision of human depravity seen in the original: they made superhumans to kill superhumans. ...That was the best thing they could think of, for a superhuman to do. That, and slave labor....Kind of like our governments, now.IMDb requires ten lines for each review, even if there's nothing left to say. IMDb still requires ten lines for each review, even if there's nothing left to say. IMDb yet still requires ten lines for each review, even if there's nothing left to say.",10,2,5,6 August 2012
The Matrix," Top-Notch Science Fiction
","The best reviews of this movie I've ever seen are the ones in Jim Davidson's 'Being Sovereign,' and in the online video by Stefan Molyneux 'Free Range Humans.' The movie is clearly an allegory to the modern nation state. We are all used against our will, with most people never even comprehending this. The Federal Reserve steals all of our labor and redirects it to what Thoreau called 'the machine of government.' Only libertarians are even aware they are enslaved, and only those who have 'woken up' are free. The comparisons are obvious, and the movie is a tribute to individualism.Just like in real life, conformists' eyes are all informant's eyes. If a conformist sees a drug deal, a firearm, or anything outside of the ordinary happening, he gets on his cell phone and reports the prohibited activity to the police (the police state). The same is true of the uncomprehending conformists in 'The Matrix,' whose faces bubble outward and morph into the 'agents' who defend the matrix.My vote/ranking is for the entire trilogy. They are all excellent. Don't miss Geoff Darrow's amazing design work. The Wachowskis are geniuses.",10,0,0,6 August 2012
Heat," Top Notch Movie From Michael Mann and Mick Gould
","Mick Gould is the technical director and consultant on this movie. Michael Mann is a careful student of his, and has let him shine in every action movie he has made since Heat. I greatly look forward to the day that Michael Mann learns the basic principles of objectivism, and makes 'Unintended Consequences' into a movie, with as much respect for detail as 'Heat' contained.Mann's other movies are also excellent, with the possible exception of Miami Vice, since the 'heroes' in that movie are so evil. As Lysander Spooner noted, 'Vices are not crimes.' The same could be true of 'Collateral' except for the fact that the cartels' hit-man intended to murder an innocent cab driver. It's an interesting commentary on the current reality of prohibition.Since 'Heat' and 'Manhunter' I've watched every movie made by Mann. He's a masterful director, and doesn't know how to make a bad movie. For those who liked 'Heat,' I strongly recommend 'Collateral' and 'Public Enemies.'",10,0,2,6 August 2012
