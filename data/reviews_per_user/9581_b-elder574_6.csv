Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," A sprawling underachiever.
","The story is a bit too convoluted to be great drama, the reliance on political manoeuvring to make up most of the story, interesting though it is, does not make great entertainment.The production is certainly lavish, an impressive level of detail is on show but herein lies the movies weakness. There is too much that does not make up part of the narrative, but rather serves a distraction from it, resulting in a movie that never flows like it should. Lame attempts at humour (some of it entirely unfunny) detract from the drama rather than adding to it, blunting the emotional scenes. The best moments are the action set pieces. Exceptionally well crafted, never dull nor confusing, the light-sabre duels are especially worthy of praise. Sadly, the film fails to juggle all the constituent elements and the overall feeling is that less might have been more.",Null,0,2,6 October 2011
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Yo ho ho ho ho ho and ho. And ho.
","Oh dear. Somewhere between the 1st and this outing the filmmakers have forgotten that these movies are supposed to be fun.I can't fault the quality of the performances or the authenticity of the sets and costumes, the SPFX are impeccable as you would expect, and Depp is a star. However the confusing plot meanders along for nearly 3 hours and what little interest I had in these characters all but evaporated in that time. The first Pirates was an unexpected joy, but there is none of that on offer here.Hans Zimmer's score is by the numbers as if he's being paid to rehash Gladiator over and again and most of the cast sleep through what is tired effort.No more please (2 sequels confirmed).",5,1,2,18 September 2011
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," A big disappointment
","The film is a noisy mess, scenes go on for far too long, the action sequences are a bore and the characters are repulsive.It is impossible to engage with Anakin Skywalker, whether Christiansen's performance is deliberately brattish and immature or not, there is no room to care for the character as he lurches from simply one temper tantrum to another. Only Christopher Lee gains pass marks, playing his role with the necessary malevolence, although given almost nothing to work with.In its favour, the special effects are spectacular, renderings of Yoda a particular joy to watch and William's love theme for the tortured couple is amongst his best work.But the film seems brutish, unnecessarily violent and has an unsavoury feel to it at times, almost seedy. As if the filmmakers were in a desperate rush to prove how grown-up the movie is, this 'adult' quality leaves a very bad taste.",Null,1,4,11 October 2011
Drive," He'll be yours for five minutes.
","A fantastic amoral thriller with art-house leanings.There is a lot to like in this film; the performances from Mulligan, Cranston and the reliable supporting cast, the script is taut and the set pieces are beautifully shot and choreographed.It is let down slightly by the third act sagging a bit and whilst likable it is difficult to care about Gosling. His performance is fine, he is exceptionally good at the quieter moments, but his hard-man pretensions never really ring true.Most of the film is incredibly tense, however there are moments when the film gives way to violence that seems too gratuitous, detracting from the piece, rather than augmenting it.It is though immensely enjoyable with much to admire.",Null,2,6,20 September 2011
Insidious," Nightmarish Chiller.
","The first half of the film is a deeply unsettling experience, the film's particular strength is in its juxtaposing mundanity with the supernatural, including some of the most nightmarish images ever seen. Sadly, the plot fizzles out quite early on to be replaced by ineffective set pieces and while the performances are on the whole good later events lose credibility, at times seeming comical.The scares are mostly effective and although the plot does not hold up to later scrutiny it is commendable the film does not rely on gore to supply the shocks.Much to recommend it.",Null,1,1,22 September 2011
Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith," A whimper rather than a bang.
","The best of the three prequels, the story reaches a satisfactory conclusion without too much of the uneven storytelling and abortive attempts at humour of the previous chapters.Again, the effects are spectacular containing lavish amounts of detail to appease the hardened fans, the performances are better and the pacing is better.Sadly, the same problems persist, an over-reliance on spectacle to tell the story, Skywalker is irritating rather than sympathetic resulting in his eventual fate rendered anti-climactic.Again, though, the film feels like a chore with very little other than the special effects to entertain.",Null,1,3,14 October 2011
