Hereditary," Just might be one of the best films I have ever seen
","Now I know that's a big statement and honestly I'm not one of those people who likes to throw a statement like that at every good film I see. But my god, I have never seen a film balance exposition and ambiguity so masterfully. It doesn't spoon feed you anything but it doesn't leave you in the dark either. On my first viewing I thought it was a solid horror film that was refreshing in the genre but on my second viewing once I pieced together all the elements I realised that this film has so many layers especially in the characterisation department. Once I knew what happened in the ending it made the movie as a whole a lot stronger and I realised that the film gives you subtle hints without them being forced down your throat. This in turn made the first half and second half more connected for me. This film just doesn't let up for it's entire runtime and delivers so much tension. Toni Collette and Alex Wolff amaze as if this is the last performance they ever get to do. Their presence commanded the screen so well that I was thoroughly immersed in the world of this film. Great performances from the rest of the cast as well. The cinematography is stunning and is in a class of its own. Some of these shots are like eye candy and compliment the film perfectly. The music is a cacophony of ambience and melodic creepiness just makes the film become a spiritual but terrifying experience.The thing this film does so well is mixing horror elements with human elements. This makes the film both horrific and relatable at the same time. With a character like Peter you feel everything he feels. This makes it even more painful when his whole family due to the cult turns against him. Seeing him reverting back to a childlike state at certain points just really resonated with me. Seeing his life at home, school, the party really sells him as being vulnerable. The fact that he is the host for Paimon and never gets to tell his parents, his friends and Bridget how he really felt about who he is as a person and Charlie's death is just truly heartbreaking. This is how you write a teen character.The film is so realistic while being out of this world. This just makes me relate to this film so much more. Ari Aster in his debut has somehow manged to understand what makes a good horror film better than a lot of his contemporaries. Truly a refreshing film in the wasteland that is horror. No film is perfect but I'm giving this a 10 based on the emotional connection I had with it. Truly a shocking, sad, complex masterpiece.",10,2,4,24 June 2018
Rocketman," Wait
","So your telling me this is an actual biopic that captures the personality of the man and carries it through in the tone of the film? Neat, sure I've seen these story beats before but the musical/fantastical element definitely brings new life into it. The first 20-30 minutes are a bit rocky and I wish some dialogue wasn't so repetitive. A bit more subtlety wouldn't have hurt too but I can't lie, this was pretty captivating and wouldn't mind watching this again, good stuff.",8,1,1,2 June 2019
Us," Jordan Peele is at it again
","The first thing I see everyone talking about with this film is the twist. I was entertained and invested enough in the film that the twist didn't really ruin it. The acting and cinematography were the best parts hands down. It more than made up for it. The twist wasn't even that bad, I liked the theme and metaphor behind it rather than the 'logistics' of it.But a better twist or non twist could've been written instead and it would've made the film stronger. Despite this I think thie twist we got certainty gives the audience a lot to chew on already. The bigger problem is the tone of the film which switches so much that it becomes kinda jarring. Regardless, I still really enjoyed this, definitely check it out.",7,1,3,29 March 2019
Spice World," Criminally Overlooked
","I don't get when people say this is vapid and has no substance when the film is a satire of those very concepts.People don't give it enough credit for that. It also never takes itself too seriously and has tons of great jokes plus meta moments. The girls play a heightened self-parody version of themselves in the film. This is most evident when they are on the bus and talk about how people stereotype them. There is clearly a layer of irony in how oblivious they are. The film also makes fun of movie hallmarks encountering many movie cliches such as alien spaceships, manipulative press, bus chases, the rags to riches flashback etc.The film delivers these tropes in a very tongue in cheek way, clearly satirizing them but never to a pretentious extent. The most impressive thing about it is that while the film is clearly mocking a lot of things it never forgets to be fun and highly entertaining. There are also surrealistic elements to the film such as the conversations between the heads of the press plotting to destroy the careers of the Spice Girls, the conversations between the movie executives and the bus chase scene. These give the film a very unique style of comedy which is more akin to sketch comedy and I would go as far to say that the bus chase is one of my favourite scenes in all of film period.A very fun, adrenaline-filled film that has been criminally overlooked. Besides, you can't go wrong with the music of the Spice Girls which the movie constantly assaults you with. Also, Baby Spice is the best spice don't @ me.",10,1,1,8 April 2019
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," This rating is coming from someone who liked The Last Jedi.......yeah
","I have simultaneously have alot to say yet nothing to say at all. This just takes the refreshing and nuanced The Last Jedi and makes a complete joke out of it. Every line or plot point from The Last Jedi that was done well has been completely warped and been made to service fan theories (the 'you're nothing' line for example). Despite this Kylo Rens arc was somewhat satisfying but it felt rushed and misunderstood by JJ's writing style.In fact you can say this about a lot of arcs in the film. The Last Jedi actually made me care about the characters and their fates, this one gave me very little reason to care. This made the major twists and turns in the film have very little emotional weight and as a whole I felt so detached. Everyone and their grandmother has been saying this but Palpatine didn't need to be included and felt lazy. JJ didn't really know how to conclude this trilogy huh.I can at least say this film is entertaining on a general level but when the film itself has so many head scratching decisions it's hard to really justify giving it a positive rating. If you enjoyed this that's great but I tried to get something out of this and I just couldn't, sorry.",3,7,12,19 December 2019
Nightcrawler," Great suspenseful thriller
","Nightcrawler (2014) is a Crime/thriller directed by Dan Gilroy and starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Reno Russo and Riz Ahmed. The story takes place in the sprawling city of L.A, the film is about Lois Bloom a man who is desperate for work and starts work in filming crime scenes and selling it for a profit.Jake Gyllenhaal is the highlight of this film possibly giving the best performance of his career as he carries the 2 hour movie along. If nothing else see it for his performance. He lost weight for his performance as he visualized his character as a coyote. Riz Ahmed also gives a great supporting performance as assistant to Jake Gyllenhaal. Riz Ahmed rode with actual night-crawlers to get better understanding for his role.Rene Russo as a news director does a good performance as well. She provides as a push in Lois rise. The cinematography is stunning from the opening shot the film pulls you in into the dark streets and the city of L.A. This is also worth the price of the ticket.The score is great as well creating a dark atmosphere but it's not the most memorable score as it could of used more contemporary music.This is Dan Gilroy's directorial debut and he's really outdone himself I can't wait to see what he does next.Nightcrawler is a contender for one of the best movies of the year and after seeing it twice I liked it even more the second time I saw it. The acting, the stunning cinematography, score and direction is the reason to see this film. Highly recommend Film rating: 8.7/10",8,1,1,21 January 2015
Yesterday," Nah, this ain't it
","Why did I see this? I'm apart of the problem. They marketed the film towards Beatles fans,millennials etc and I took the bait. 99% of the humor in this film falls flat. They are base level observational, cringy, pandering to millenial humor. There were literally two jokes I laughed at and that was it. The characters are messily written especially Lily James character. She contradicted herself many times and made so many stupid and annoying decisons. Credit where credit she did do a good performance and had some good moments but they were few and far between. Jack is ok as the lead but his character motivation is all over the place. Without much spoliers he changes his stance on stealing the Beatles songs constantly and it's quite dumbfounding.And that's ignoring the fact that he is such a bland and uninteresting chatcter. The story is literally like every other music biopic meets romance plot and is predictable at every turn. There are an incredible amount of plot holes and lack of narrative development. They didn't care if the story made sense at all. I honestly could go on forever but the last thing I want to mention is that Ed Sheeran wasn't that bad. He did an decent job, it's just that the material they gave him was terrible. I guess this isn't the worst movie I've seen by any stretch but please don't see this. Just see Parasite instead, at least this film made me realise how great that film was.",3,13,31,28 June 2019
Avengers: Endgame," I see you Marvel....
","Drowns in its own pool at times but it would be stupid to say this wasn't entertaining af. I could point out a multitude of flaws with this thing (some subplots that come outta nowhere, the mishandled pacing, tone, some of that humour ooft etc) But the film has such an emotional pull that it kinda makes up for it. Without that pull, this woulda been a 6 but the added human element takes this from a forgettable blockbuster to one of the most emotionally resonant superhero films ever. For once I was happy there wasn't an after credits scene.EDIT 29/04/19Second ViewingSecond time round stayed mostly the same. Since the surprises were taken out it was a more relaxed and analytical second viewing. While it didn't emotionally impact me as strongly, the film was still engaging enough. Some of the issues I had were amplified and kinda detracted from the overall experience. I'm not lowering my rating because of this but the film definitely loses a bit of its punch on the second viewing. Infinity War got better on second viewing which I think has to do with the Avengers and Thanos having a strong arc, something this film lacks.",6,1,5,26 April 2019
Toy Story 4," Oh boy
","I enjoyed myself, I can't deny that. The humor was mostly well done and the film had some fantastic character moments. The only thing is what is this films purpose in the franchise? Toy Story 4 felt like a broken record at points repeating recurring themes that have been ingrained by the first three films. I don't have a problem with this inherently but the film doesn't try to make them fresh. It often repeats plot points from the previous films. Sure we get a new unexplored theme but this theme isn't realised in it's full potential. We get causal hints of it but we get very little insight into not only the theme but how Woody feels about it. When the ending comes it doesn't feel earned.The film is more concerned with being humourous the majority of the time. So when the emotional punch comes it doesn't feel organic within the story. You can't be humourous a good chunk of the time and expect the audience to be emotionally invested. The only reason people are invested is because of the previous three films. Now, I won't lie, I was emotionally impacted by these hard hitting character moments and it's hard not to get swept up into the drama of it all. The only thing is that when your characters and themes aren't developed enough I can't get fully invested. Sure I laughed and had fun with this but don't hit me with emotional beats if your not going to put the proper effort into making it feel like a complete, cathartic addition to the franchise.EDIT 27/6/19",5,2,6,24 June 2019
Climax," This is the most accurate depiction of nightlife I've seen.
","The night starts out ok with people talking about 50 things all at once. It feels long, it feels drawn out, but you put up with it. The music starts and even though it's not the best you give in. You can't hear anything anyone is saying and when you do, it makes no sense. All that aside though you're having fun. Sure it's not perfect but maybe you've been too negative about the whole thing. There's something oddly mesmerizing about it and you feel like your in some euphoric trance. Then sometimes there's that clutch moment where everything goes 180. You don't even know how this happened. You sit down and wonder why you ever decided to go out in the first place. The things you wanted out of the night are completely gone and now you're just left to deal with the burnout.That is this movie.",10,1,2,26 May 2019
Avengers: Infinity War," One word 'Rabbit'
","This film is definitely the best MCU film we have gotten so far (Spider-Man Homecoming is probably a close second). The film subverted a lot of superheroe cliches and opted for a more realistic portrayal. Sure, being a mainstream superhero film there is gonna be conventions and fan service but I think they didn't overstuff it with them. The humour mostly lands although there are some jokes that do fall flat ('This is awkward') but luckily they are few and far between. Thanos is the best villain yet since he has actual reasoning and motivation. Even if you don't agree with him you can still understand why he does what he does I enjoyed the subplot with the Guardians which was the highlight. I honestly 
wouldn't be against Thor and the Guardians having a spin off movie and going on adventures. I think it would be entertaining. Thor constantly calling Rocket 'Rabbit' was hilarious. While you do have great subplots like these other ones are not as interesting such as the Vison/Captain America storyline. This was uninteresting and I was waiting for it to get back to the Guardians or Peter Parker/Tony Stark storyline. Although the film's tonality is disjointed and always changing it's still manages to be consistent and cohesive. Although it can be quite jarring at times.The ending was great and shocking, for a mainstream superhero film to do this is commendable. Spider-Man's death nearly reduced me to tears, his line 'I don't wanna go' is heartbreaking, awesome acting by Tom Holland.This film is great addition to the MCU and I hope we can expect similar or better films in the future.",7,1,2,29 April 2018
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," A refreshing entry in Quentin's filmography
","Sometimes when watching a film, it's nice to see something that just lets the characters 'be'. There's no real overarching plot, just a bunch of characters living their daily lives trying to achieve similar goals. Some scenes work better than others to portray this message but it's hard to deny the endearing qualities of the film. When something plot reliant does happen it feels like an explosion (albeit a jarring one). The dialogue changes its tone and style depending on what it's paying homage to. While I get what Quentin was trying to do with this, in parts, it ends up confusing the framing of the film. In the grander scheme of the film, it's not something that ruins the experience.This film is a bizarre yet reserved entry into Quentin's filmography. The dialogue is less stylistic and more subtle. This is why I think this film is quite different from his other works. It's admirable that this late into his career he is still taking risks and there's something in that people will keep coming back to. The film sums it's mission statement perfectly with the exchange between the little girl and Leo, there's something cynical yet earnest in that exchange and that's what makes Once Upon a Time such a resonant experience. The relationship between the real and the imagined experience. Taking these tropes and breathing new life into them and from Tarantino, I wouldn't expect any less.",6,10,20,15 August 2019
The Lion King," The fart jokes say it all
","As much as it might seem I would rather not be hateful towards things. In fact, I don't want to be one of those people that just trashes Disney remakes based on principle. There is potential for a remake that expands and improves the emotional depth of the original. The Lion King (2019) is a far cry from this philosophy and opts for the exact opposite. The film rushes through each emotional beat of the original and fails to understand how facial expressions and dialogue can be used to sell a scene. Take Scar, for instance, everything he says feels misplaced and voidless. He doesn't feel intimidating and is honest to god a slap in the face to the original. A lot of the voice acting feels very underwhelming and could've used some refining. Others have mentioned it but realism doesn't make for a good movie.People want to see movies where they can attach their own emotions onto it. This film completely disregards this and ultimately doesn't understand how to make a competent film. If I want to see real animals I'd watch Animal Planet. I'm in the minority on this but I think the CGI on the animals looks awful. The animation aesthetic looks dated to me and is completely devoid of colour or vibrancy. Not to mention some unintentionally goofy scenes. The jokes in this film that worked in the original, completely fail here. This due to no comedic timing and lack of body language. The new ones they've included don't appeal to me and feel like a lesser version of the jokes in the original (The fart jokes ooft). I just want to make it clear that I don't think the original is a flawless masterpiece. The second half of the original feels rushed and misses the emotional strength of the first half.However, this one makes this issue even more obvious. This new remake stretches the pacing too its very limits. At times I felt like I was watching a 5-hour movie and I was just waiting for the sweet release of the end credits. The music was handled okay but none of the instrumentals, production and vocal performances captured the urgency and expansiveness of the original soundtrack. There is also some ill-fitted terrible Beyonce remix during the film that almost made me block my ears at how bad it was. The last thing I want to mention is the lack of originality. They didn't try to create a unique vision instead they opted for a safe version. If you have seen the original there is no reason to see this. Apart from additional jokes, alternative lines and unnecessary exposition, it felt like a more stale carbon copy of the original.So yeah, everything I dreaded it would be. Disney has hit rock bottom and for a company that has brought so much happiness into people lives, it feels downright manipulative.",2,74,111,21 July 2019
Amadeus," Exciting, Bombastic, it's Amadeus
","Makes nearly 3 hours feel like 5 minutes, a masterclass in pacing and telling a compelling story. The film doesn't take itself too seriously. It would've been way easier to make a by the books serious historical drama. The film decides to make everything a farce and challenge your preconceived notions of what truly makes a great composer and ultimately what makes good music. Amadeus himself is a ticking time-bomb.Constantly making a joke out of a lot of the situations he gets into. The one thing that keeps him so interesting is his willingness to go against norms of the time. Wolfgang made the music he connected with and you can see that when he conducts. It explodes off the screen. His music absolutely kicks tons of ass. Even if the people in Mozart's day didn't think the same. Salieri is the perfect antithesis. People loved his music at the time but unlike Mozart, his music has been pushed to the side. He still has an appreciation of Mozart's music but he doesn't like the implications and the behaviour of the man that comes with it.By the last 30 minutes, the two come together and it is one of the best and most beautiful scenes I have ever seen. Perfectly captures the magic of composing and loving music. The amount of humanity that is shown between these two is the emotional heart of the film and feels like the perfect climax.Amadeus doesn't hold back, it's exciting and bombastic but it never forgets the humanity behind its characters, and I think that's what makes it truly special.",10,0,0,30 March 2019
Star Wars: Episode VIII - The Last Jedi," Ok, hear me out
","Similar to how Revenge of the Sith was a full-on embrace of the melodrama and stakes associated with a Star Wars film, The Last Jedi is almost the complete opposite: a progressive, mature and nuanced look at a Star Wars film. Throughout the film not only does it showcase the typical beats of a mid-chapter Star Wars film (The Empire Strikes Back) but provides more subversive, interesting and subdued takes on its themes. Concepts such as the futile nature of good and evil, letting the past become something new and revaluating the role of each character is something this film does extremely well.Benicio Del Toro's DJ acts as a representation of some of these themes. He poses various questions to Finn that question the black and white nature of the First Order and the Resistance. Both sides while having different goals, succumb to similar vices and are both filled with humans who have made mistakes at one time or another. This concept later comes back when Finn and Rose get captured. DJ doesn't see it as a betrayal but as a minor failure in the Resistances victory. DJ just decides to go along with it for the time being, he just doing what he needs to get by, he's a free man, not bound by collectives.A find this dialogue sums up his thought process:DJ: 'They blow you up today, you can blow them up tomorrow. It's just business.'Finn: 'You're Wrong'DJ: 'Maybe'Not only does this act as a summing up of his character, but it also acts as a mission statement for the film. This line of dialogue questions the very nature of conflict in the Star Wars universe. DJ acts from the perspective of someone who has seen all this war before and sees through all the superficiality of it. Finn is younger, more naive and views the events in a more simplistic manner. DJ shows us reality is not set in stone and that things aren't set in absolutes. Showing us that even in a galaxy far, far away things are more real and complex then we might have initially presumed. Rian Johnson also uses this interaction to make a statement about the simplistic subtext of previous Star Wars films.DJ is the closest character to Rian's personality, Using DJ as a way to put his own commentary on the franchise. This choice doesn't alienate the audience however, it invites them to think about more about how we view Star Wars films. In fact, Rian's treatment of Rey and Lukes arc throughout the film acts as a redefinition of what the Jedi and Force mean. Letting go of the Jedi lore and using the force as a personal means of expression. When Luke sacrifices himself, in the end, it allows him to help others while evaluating his purpose. This allows him to exercise his own means of expression.That's the main thing that draws me to The Last Jedi. Rian puts his own commentary while keeping the integrity and personality of the characters. This isn't just some post-modernist meta jerk off for the director's pleasure, the film actually cares about its characters and the entertainment factor. You can still watch the film without the subtext or commentary and still have a good time with it. If you hate The Last Jedi and what it tries to do with the franchise that's fair enough. It's not for everyone and I don't like every single choice and subplot that was included. However, I look at what the film has done right it trumps any flaws I might have with it. The Last Jedi is tied with The Empire Strikes Back as the greatest Star Wars film and that feels so good to say.",9,5,13,13 December 2019
The Wolf of Wall Street," A Non Stop Roller Coaster RIde
","**Very Minor Spoilers**The Wolf of Wall Street starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Martin Scorsese is an excellent movie full of Drama, Deception, Swindling and even a bit of comedy. So whats the story: Jordan Belfort a Stockbroker who starts as just a normal broker for a firm in wall street, but after the firm he works for shuts down he decides to go out on his own.This movie is a nearly a non-stop roller coaster ride for 3 hours but it never gets boring and always surprises you. Leo gives a stellar performance as Jordan Belfort. When i am watching him i forget he is Leonardo DiCaprio i really think he is Jordan Belfort which is an amazing feat. Not to mention a great supporting performance from Jonah Hill. Highly RecommendedThe soundtrack is also very good as well there is a wide variety of artist ranging from Bo Diddley to Billy Joel. My favorite track of the album is Howlin' Wolf's - Smokestack Lightin and Spoonful (by the same artist)Conclusion: The Wolf of Wall Street is an excellent movie and highly recommend you go see it for excellent direction from Martin Scorsese and Great performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill. The soundtrack is also recommend for wide variety of genres and great tunes.The Wolf of Wall Street gets my rating of: 8/10Thank for reading my review i hope you found it helpful if you did then leaves some feedback and maybe some stuff i can improve on for next time.",9,2,5,1 July 2014
It Chapter Two," Bonkers just....bonkers
","Damn, I underestimated how much restraint Cary Fukunaga gave the first one. This film is bonkers and doesn't take a breather. This insanity works for the film's benefit and weakness. In saying this, the characterisation was interesting and I liked the contrast between childhood and adult fears. As you've probably heard the grown-up Loser club are great and their emotional progression throughout help to elevate the film as a whole. For as absurd and over the top as this film is there were instances where it worked in the film's favour and when it worked, the results were very satisfying. When it doesn't it feels like the weight of the film gets lost and all we're left with is a bunch of CGI effects and gross-out scares (some of which verge on comical).The first one understood that the kids fear was the horror and not the monster itself. This made it more psychologically interesting. This one has elements of that but it kinda focuses on the (jump) scares themselves rather than the implications. Sometimes at the expense of character development. I feel like without Fukunaga it loses some of that subtlety (even if his contribution to the first one was cut down due to him leaving the project). The pacing/length is good for the most part and I didn't feel the run time. The only instances of this were in the middle of the film which gets quite repetitive and the ending which gradually got draining. What helped elevate the ending was the emotional and cathartic resolution for the characters.Yes, this film is deeply flawed but there's enough good stuff that I ended up enjoying it. Considering how hard a book like IT is to adapt, I appreciate that they gave it a shot even if the final result leaves something to be desired.I can't decide between a 5 or 6 but I'mma just leave it at a 6 for now cause I'm in a happy mood.",5,1,2,8 September 2019
Parasite," Really freakin good
","Engaging and bonkers film that is worth it for the adrenaline alone. The film had so many good performances and the charcters were well developed. The sequences and reveals throughout kept me engaged. I can't say I'm the biggest fan of the story that unfolded as it got unfocused but it was very enjoyable. The impression I got from reviews is that it is totally unpredictable and unique. I didn't get that impression from watching the film as it included plot arcs that I have seen in other films. The ending is pretty hard hitting though and one that I won't dare spoil. Please seek this one out if you can, it is very much worth your time.",7,14,40,28 June 2019
Marriage Story," I don't know what to say
","This hit way too close to home, it was almost surreal how much the film mirrorred my own life. My parents recently went through a divorce and the way Nicole and Charlie's proceedings played out was almost too much to handle. It was almost too confronting, too emotionally gut punching, too real that I almost starting balling my eyes out in the theatre.It's like this movie came at the right time and in the right moment. Just when I needed it most. This week for me hasn't been the best, a lot of things have been overwhelming for me. The film in a weird way, despite all the events devolving in chaos, told me that things are sometimes awful, unpredictable and emotionally draining but that's ok. The performances, direction, script all came together to deliver something that will always be special to me.This film does have flaws, yes, but I don't really care, films like this only come once in a lifetime. Sometimes emotions mean more than cold hard criticism. I didn't expect this film to hit as hard as it did, godammit, just go see it already.",8,382,519,14 November 2019
Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure," Absolutely Righteous
","Had the privilege of watching a nice transfer of this absolutely righteous film on the big screen. The chemistry and dialogue between Bill and Ted is the highlight and almost every line is a hit ('Remember when I asked her to the prom?, SHUT UP, TED!'). Most of the effects hold up pretty well and had that 80s shine to it. Even though I knew what was going to happen, the film still kept me on edge and I consider that an acheivement.Some of pacing and humor involving the historical figures haven't held up as well as I had hoped, but the crowd in my cinema elevated my experience (Some guy was shouting out lines and I couldn't help laughing everytime). This film more than anything else just absolutely nails it's concept and is very tight from front to back (more than I can say for a lot of modern blockbusters).This film more than a lot of others holds a sentimental place in my heart. It got me through many a boring afternoons and helped me develop my own sense of humor. To that I am eternally grateful to this film and all I have to say is, PARTY ON DUDES.",9,1,2,12 July 2019
The Breakfast Club," 'We're Not Alone'
","What happens when you put 5 high school stereotypes together? You get The Breakfast Club. Directed by John Hughes this film follows 5 teenagers who have to serve a Saturday detention and write a report about 'who they are''. We discover the 5 personalities 'The Jock - Andrew', 'The Criminal - Bender', 'The Princess - Claire', 'The Nerd - Brian' and 'The Basket Case - Allison'. The characters are set up as stereotypes in the beginning but as the film progresses we see ''they're are not so different after all'.The film while slower in pace doesn't drag and kept my attention for the run time. The comedy from Bender, the awkwardness of Brian, The tough guy attitude of Andrew ,the snobbery of Claire and the weirdness of Allison keeps the film entertaining. The personalities of the 5 work well together and this allows for some great scenes.Their are also two other players in this story,Vernon and Carl. Vernon is the authoritarian figure and Carl is the laid back janitor. These two represents the different perspectives of the previous generation. Vernon is pessimistic and aggressive towards the current generation while Carl is more optimistic and empathetic towards the current generation. This conveys the theme of the generational gap and this allows for the audience to see different perspectives. Vernon and Carl are less developed than the 5 main characters and as such are more one dimensional. This is one of the few criticisms of the film aside from some questionable 80s dance scenes (although they are fun as hell).The most beautiful thing about this film is the theme of similarity and difference. This is conveyed in the group therapy scene where each of them reveal secrets about themselves. This shows the audience that each of the 5 characters problems are different but they're all going through a similar struggle. The struggle of being accepted by parents, peers, teachers and society at large. This is something that a lot of people can relate to including myself. I tend to identify with Brian's character the most.Give this film a try, you just might discover that 'we're not so different after all'",9,0,0,12 January 2018
The Breakfast Club," 30 years on still a great film
","The Breakfast Club (review): To coincide with the 30th anniversary The Breakfast Club i am going to be doing a review of this timeless film (kinda?) The Breakfast Club- Rating M (1985) directed by John Hughes and starring Molly Ringwald (Claire), Emilio Estevez (Andrew), Judd Nelson (Bender) Anthony Michael Hall (Brian), Ally Sheedy (Alison) and Paul Gleason (Richard Vernon ) is a Drama/Comedy about five high school stereotypes who have to be together in the result of a Saturday detention but later find out that their's a lot more to each other then they realized.First of all the acting more specifically the chemistry between the 5 leads they work effortlessly together developing and also demeaning each other until they come to like each other. My favorite is Bender one of the most funniest teen or maybe film characters of all time he constantly got a laugh out of me and really he is a good take of the criminal character despite at times how stereotypical he is.The writing (script) if you can believe it was written in just two days, now that's astonishing. Despite how much little time it took to write the script to is just as good as the acting is. The writing feels very natural and relate able and accessible (although some of it was improvised) still relating to teen problems today. The writing although using stereotypes redeems itself when the characters come to get to know each other more.The directing is just as good as the acting and writing. John Hughes got good performances out of the actors and does a good job in making the story cohesive.The cinematography is not stunning or have big CGI special effects but its not supposed to. The location in which it's set makes good use for the lack of cinematography.The music is decent apart from the Simple Minds track Don't You Forget About Me which is one of the signature song of the 80's. The song's are somewhat forgettable and really belong to the corniness of the 80's.If there are flaws with the movie it would have to be it's corniness at least in the Dance scene which is not really necessary but it's fun nether less but it does ruin this movie's chances of being truly timeless.The only other flaws have is the Principal he very one dimensional and doesn't have much of a character aside from being the oppressive teacher. While the main five leads start off like that at least they were developed at least that's my opinion.Overall this movie is a 80's hallmark that introduced the teen hallmarks without this movie we probably wouldn't have movies like ''Mean Girls or 10 Things i hate about you. Definitely check it out. Film Rating: 8/10",9,0,2,17 February 2015
