Ford v Ferrari," First half heats up the engine; second half steps firmly on the gas - 9/10 ⭐
","After a slightly glacial exposition into the history of the stories behind motor companies Ford and Ferrari, the film goes into full on over-drive with one of the most pulsating second halves in a film you're sure to see all year. The film is a technical marvel with top-notch editing, sound design and direction - almost a lock to get nominations (and probably wins) in those categories and then some. Bale and Damon are simply stupendous, showing a real sensitivity in the more dramatic moments while showcasing their charisma and comedic chops in performances that rank among the year's best. F v. F is an exhilarating, exciting and emotional ride to be in the driver's seat for and undoubtedly one of this year's best.",9,2,3,27 November 2019
Love and Death," One of Allen's funniest, and most underrated, creations
","'<a href='/title/tt0073312/'>Love and Death (1975)</a>' is arguably one of, if not, the funniest <a href='/name/nm0000095/'>Woody Allen</a> film to ever be created. Allen plays Boris, the politically ambivalent, pacifist and neurotic soldier whom, against his will, must fight for the Russian Army. He's in love with Sonja (Keaton), his 'cousin twice removed', whose never expressed any kind of mutual feelings towards him. But with their intricate, existential conversations, you'd think they're a match made in intellectual heaven.This film offers us snippets of those who have inspired Allen's career. <a href='/name/nm0000005/'>Ingmar Bergman</a> the acclaimed Swedish director, has always been a huge influence of Allen's work, with both men showing this kind of fascination with death. The scenes with the Grim Reaper (dressed in white, not black) and Boris are a wonderful homage that calls to mind Bergman's '<a href='/title/tt0050976/'>Det sjunde inseglet (1957)</a>', though done in a satirical manner which is more Allen- esque. He also pays tribute to <a href='/name/nm0000122/'>Charles Chaplin</a> with the likes of a hilarious slapstick gag.Some of the humour is straightforward while other jokes require that extra knowledge of classic literature and/or European cinema. But the humor is relentless and done with such care - every scene with Allen and Keaton together is absolute gold. And with the occasional 4th wall breaks, in classic Woody style, we are given that perfect dose of introspection that will make you question much of life's ambiguity once all the laughs have faded away. A near-perfect film by Allen.",10,6,7,28 August 2016
Your Name.," One of the most beautiful films I've ever seen
","This film will leave you speechless - it is quite simply one of the most beautifully crafted films I've ever seen. The animation is breathtaking and possibly the most beautiful animation ever put to screen. There really are no words to capture exactly how it makes you feel because this is simply a film that will move you in inexplicable ways. Sit down, enter the world that <a href='/name/nm1396121/'>Makoto Shinkai</a> has presented to us and soak in all of the magic. Un-be-lievable experience!",10,21,33,25 August 2017
Training Day," 'You gotta be a wolf to catch a wolf' - 8/10 ⭐
","Denzel and Ethan are great as the two leads in a day-in-the-life of training for the narcotics division of the L.A.P.D.

Denzel has never been more electric and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. <a href='/name/nm0298807/'>Antoine Fuqua</a>'s undisputed masterpiece!",8,1,2,1 November 2019
Shaun of the Dead," Inventive and fun satire of those bloody zombie movies
","<a href='/title/tt0365748/'>Shaun of the Dead (2004)</a> is an extremely creative and entertaining film created by famed director <a href='/name/nm0942367/'>Edgar Wright</a>. Showcasing some of the snap-zooms and whip-pans that would later serve as his trademarks, as well as his use of dark humor and gags, this is a film that shows a master of cinema in the making while paying tribute to a genre that has long been rehashed. Hilarious (and even, at times, touching) performances from Pegg and Frost to boot - just good ol' bloody fun!",7,2,4,20 May 2019
The Babadook," A frustrating second half dampens the effect of a spectacularly tense and promising beginning
","For the first hour or so, The Babadook unfolds as a spectacular film. The story is set out for us of a widowed mother named Amelia who has struggled to cope in life following the death of her husband. What's complicated the recovery process is being the mother to Samuel, a six-year old with serious social and behavioural issues. One day, Sam finds a seemingly children-targeted book in his shelf called Mister Babadook, which she can read to make him fall asleep. But the imagery of the book is disturbing, so much so that it begins to haunt ('Dook! Dook! Dook') Amelia and Sam It's as soon as from the opening scene that we get a sense of the surrealistic elements the film will present us with. And everything right from the beginning credits click - the sinister atmosphere is developed, slowly and unnervingly. Amelia is exhausted but sharp, emotionally damaged but poised and self-assured. Sam is unstable, impulsive and riotous. Both struggle in a world post the death of Oskar (Amelia's wife / Sam's dad) and even their closest loved ones struggle to have Amelia and Sam a part of their lives. What makes this film spectacular in the first half is its gradual development and subsequent change of both its tone and characters demeanour. Without spoiling any of the plot, how the characters interact and behave in the beginning slowly transforms and this subtle shift is pulled off masterfully. Their is a loss in humanity that doesn't come off as contrived or forced. And with only a mere 90 minute run-time, it is done incredibly efficiently, something with which many longer horror films struggle. This is thanks to the incredible cinematography, direction and acting. This film is strongest when it suggests and doesn't show. Its buildups far exceed their payoffs - the incredibly subtle camera-work and construction of suspense is stuff Hitchcock and Kubrick would be proud of. In fact, in terms of a film creating a sheer tense atmosphere, The Babadook is among the best I've ever seen to do so. It is unfortunate that a strong first half is derailed by an unquestionably inferior second half, with a puzzling ending that will probably leave you frustrated. Nevertheless though, this remains one of the best horror films of the 2010s and certainly one of the best Australian horror films in recent memory.",8,1,2,27 October 2017
Us," 'Get Out' of the mindset that this is a straight-forward horror film
","People thinking this will be a straight-forward horror film will be disappointed; <a href='/title/tt6857112/'>Us (2019)</a> is a complex, mind bending experience that tests the limitations of what a horror film can be. What's great about the film is how differently people will interpret what they've witnessed. I left the theater tonight to the sounds of people passionately discussing theories, different explanations and thoughts on it all - and that, to me, is one of the great joys in leaving a great film.",7,514,898,22 March 2019
Coffee and Cigarettes," As slice of life as its title suggests
","Featuring 11 vignettes which are all connected simply by the presence of coffee and cigarettes, <a href='/name/nm0000464/'>Jim Jarmusch</a>'s film shows people at their most ordinary. There isn't really a plot nor themes to connect any of the conversations, but each of the segments are short and allows its viewer to peer into the minds of different individuals. With moviegoers so conditioned to look for meaning and cohesive storylines, Jarmusch simply paints us a picture of everyday life and does so with a keen sense of space and composition.",6,1,1,13 May 2019
Knives Out," Bringing back the classic whoddunit in amazingly entertaining fashion - 8/10 ⭐
","What an excellent film by <a href='/name/nm0426059/'>Rian Johnson</a>; definitely feels like the film he was destined to make. Writing that is slick as hell, sublime performances (most notably Daniel Craig who brings his A-game in a wonderfully charismatic turn), superb editing and wonderfully atmospheric music - all tied together by masterful direction. Will probably be among the most fun you have at a theatre this year and fans of Agatha Christie and old murder mystery stories will have plenty to love here - a nostalgically entertaining time!",8,614,818,29 November 2019

",...are some of Scorsese's most beautifully poignant moments ever put to film. Yet another gem to add to this legend's cinematic arsenal. Masterpiece!,8,8,15,3 December 2019
The Great Dictator," Satire perfectly juxtaposed with drama
","The Great Dictator is an exceptional film that sees Chaplin shine in a dual role. The only shred of resemblance shared by these two protagonists is their appearance, which plays out in a very clever manner as the film progresses. The satirical manner in which Chaplin carries out Hynkel's oratory is comedy at its finest. Seamlessly blending both comical ingenuity and serious subject matter, The Great Dictator is a hilarious and pensive film produced to perfection. The now famous anti-Nazi speech given at the end is nothing short of mesmerizing. Making an impassioned plea for brotherhood and goodwill, Chaplin deliver's one of the most introspective speeches in cinema history. Chaplin's first true sound film more than stands the test of time after almost 80 years and is quite simply one of the most magnificent films ever crafted.",10,3,4,15 July 2016
About Time," A wonderfully inventive rom-com with a great message at its core
","What a breath of fresh air to see such creative strides taken in the romance genre with this wonderfully crafted film directed and written by <a href='/name/nm0193485/'>Richard Curtis</a>, a man who gets romance as well as he understands people. I loved the messaging of this film and how the time we have with loved ones is precious, not to be taken for granted. It's beautifully shot, directed and acted and packs some great food for thought as well. Two 👍up!",8,2,2,25 March 2019
BlacKkKlansman," A competently made, solid re-telling of real events; nothing more nothing less.
","A solid film that is well-directed and acted. Personally liked <a href='/title/tt0097216/'>Do the Right Thing (1989)</a> better; I felt that to be a more insightful look into the characters of the story, whereas this seemed to be only about the investigation. Not one of my favorites of 2018, but still a solid outing from Spike.",7,2,5,15 March 2019
Suicide Squad," An absolute mess of a 'movie' that succumbs to familiar formulas
","Firstly, I think it is fair to say that Suicide Squad does not merit all the backlash it has received thus far, especially from critics. Certainly this film deserves a fate better than a 25% rotten tomatoes score that is akin to films like House of Wax and Howard the Duck. With such massive hype surrounding its release, DC was certainly hard-pressed to deliver. But alas, here we are and while this film isn't perfect, it does get some things right and provides its viewers with ample entertainment. At the end of the day though, this 'movie', though it doesn't even merit that status, is an utter mess.One aspect of this film I felt it struggled to offer us was an adequate backstory for many of its main characters. As a result, we're left with a flurry of personalities that frankly feels a little messy and disorganized. But perhaps it is somewhat paradoxical to learn about the psyche of characters who are anything but human. With visually fantastical super villains like Enchantress, Killer Croc and El Diablo, this film is certainly a treat for the eyes more than the brain. There are certainly many plot holes and the occasional cringy dialogue. Even come the film's end, you feel like you have witnessed an under-developed, completely rushed plot that is certainly difficult to genuinely buy into. It fails where films like the Dark Knight have succeeded in creating a believable, sinister atmosphere that transcends the realm of comic book and enters suspenseful thriller material.But if you temper your expectations a little, Suicide Squad presents itself as a somewhat fun, action- packed flick. Viola Davis, Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto (among others) bring their A-game but unfortunately were given a sub-par script to work with. The story-line certainly tries to cram in many superfluous details, injecting Batman into the plot being one. I guess I felt with such a stunning array of characters at their disposal, S.S. left a lot to be desired.",4,2,4,6 August 2016
Shutter Island," Stunning visuals and great performances make this neo-noir a fine addition to Scorsese's oeuvre
","Upon revisiting <a href='/title/tt1130884/'>Shutter Island (2010)</a>, I was reminded of the attention to detail Scorsese puts into so every line, every shot and every second of this film. Leo delivers a characteristically phenomenal performance as Teddy Daniels (or is it Andrew Laeddis?) - the range he pulls off here, especially in the second half of the film, is a sight to be seen. Also noteworthy in their performances are Kingsley, Ruffalo and <a href='/name/nm0355097/'>Jackie Earle Haley</a> (in a short yet powerful role here!) It's also interesting to note all the parallels the film shares with <a href='/title/tt0209144/'>Memento (2000)</a> (Mentally-ill protagonist delusional over his wife's 'accidental' death all while caught in a trap of trying to solve it with people he's not sure he can trust). All in all, a really solid film. All hail Scorsese - the man can simply do no wrong!",8,1,2,17 April 2019
Glory," One of the greatest Civil War films ever made
","Incredible performances (including <a href='/name/nm0000243/'>Denzel Washington</a> as Pvt. Trip in a breakthrough turn that nabbed him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor), wonderful cinematography, music and direction in this inspiring story of the first all-black regiment to fight during the Civil War. These men were some of the unsung heroes of a chapter in history that isn't discussed enough and the film pays solid tribute to their bravery, struggles and, ultimately, redemption. This is definitely one of the greatest films ever made about the Civil War.",8,1,2,25 May 2019
The Passion of Joan of Arc," Falconetti's breathtaking performance is undoubtedly one of the greatest the silver screen has ever seen
","<a href='/name/nm0266029/'>Maria Falconetti</a> is simply outstanding in this film; playing the eponymous character who claims she has seen and been sent by God, she delivers a transcendental performance that is overwhelmingly raw and visceral. Shot predominantly in close-ups, the tight framing restricts us to narrowly focus in on her state of fear and immerse us right into the emotional turmoil through which she is suffering. POV shots of the French clergyman ingeniously add to this effect as we experience the fear of the dire circumstances through Joan's eyes. And the fact that Falconetti never acted again only adds to the eeriness of her performance. With cinematography that was way ahead of its time and an incredible score to boot, this is simply a masterpiece of cinema. Far and away one of the greatest silent films ever conceived.",9,4,5,21 April 2019
The Color of Money," A stylish and fun film that unfortunately lacks the depth and strong characterization of its predecessor
","25 years after Paul Newman starred as 'Fast' Eddie Felson in <a href='/title/tt0054997/'>The Hustler (1961)</a>, he reprised his role and teamed up with another legend in <a href='/name/nm0000217/'>Martin Scorsese</a> to bring us <a href='/title/tt0090863/'>The Color of Money (1986)</a>. Undoubtedly stylish and entertaining, it seems to lack the depth and atmospheric feel of 'The Hustler'. Cruise gives an honest but not terribly likeable performance as Vincent Lauria and <a href='/name/nm0001512/'>Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio</a> does well with what she's given. I think the problem was some of the performances came off slightly cartoonish, though I suppose it's difficult to fully recapture the realism and magic that we had with 'The Hustler', far and away one of the greatest films of the '60s. Scorsese takes a different approach here and allows his art of a filmmaker to shine through during the pool scenes, which are handled fairly artistically through innovative angles and shots (no pun intended). It's most certainly got style but the substance just wasn't what it could have been given where it's come from.",7,2,2,3 May 2019
Judgment at Nuremberg," A one-of-a-kind cinematic treasure BUT an extremely important one as well...
","'Judgment at Nuremberg' chronicles one of the most shameful periods in human history, one that some have not only forgotten but even dismissed as ever existing. Thanks to Stanley Kramer and Co. we are presented with a cathartic and engrossing take on the actual trials that took place between 1945 and 1949 that is as memorable as it is enduring. When four Nazi judges are tried for committing crimes against humanity, it is up to Chief Justice Haywood to carefully examine the evidence presented by many to come to a verdict.In one has to be one of the finest courtroom dramas ever filmed, the 3 hour run time really feels like much less and much can be attributed to the tour-de-force direction of Stanley Kramer. His minimalist filmmaking and innovative camera angles almost instantly brings to mind the engrossing camera-work from another treasured courtroom drama in '12 Angry Men', directed masterfully by Sidney Lumet. The camera is so subtle and swift in its movement that it becomes a kind of conscious onlooker of the case – this technique almost eliminates the feel of a screen between us and the film and inexplicably thrusts you right into the court with all of the other attendants. It also keeps your eyes absolutely glued to each nuance and detail that arises in the courtroom.Spencer Tracy gives a fantastically understated performance as Judge Dan Haywood, the morally conflicted and kindhearted judge. Tracy's character is able to appeal to both our ethics and emotions by playing his role with complete conviction and honesty. As the trials progress, we find ourselves wondering how we would operate in his authority – and he makes it clear throughout the film that every decision he makes affects not merely the soldiers on trial, but an entire country and even generations to come. Consider in the concluding trial scenes the way he shows a palpable struggle to declare Lancaster's character (Ernst Janning) guilty, masterfully demonstrating an imbalance between what his head and heart want. Also fantastic in their roles, albeit short-lived, are Judy Garland, Montgomery Clift and William Shatner.Maximilian Schell plays Hans Rolfe, a German defence attorney, who argues that the defendants were not the only ones to assist in, or turn a blind eye to, the crimes. This too is a morally conflicted man (one of many prominent themes in the film) who is determined on preserving the dignity of a nation. And his arguments are centered on the notion that these soldiers were trying to act in the best interest of the country. Schell is compassionate, astute and compelling in his role and makes each time he sets foot on the podium a memorable one. It's also highly entertaining to watch his back-and-forths with Richard Widmark's Colonel Tad Lawson in the courtroom.This film is impeccably written, acted and directed. I am hesitant to use the word 'film' here because a creation of this kind, that tackles this kind of subject matter so perfectly, is so much more than that. It shows how pervasive and damaging an ideology can become in a particular context. It's devastating to imagine these times actually existing and it takes something like 'Judgment at Nurembourg' to remind people that they did indeed happen. This is powerful filmmaking at its finest, whose merit far exceeds its mere entertainment value. Masterpiece.",10,3,5,23 May 2017
Dunkirk," A harrowing film of Hitchcockian suspense and epic proportions
","Christopher's Nolan latest film see him taking aspects we've seen him employ in his other films combined to make what might be his most mature feature to date. It combines the sheer scope we've seen in films like 'Inception' and 'Interstellar' with the structurally fascinating elements that make up those like 'Memento' and 'The Prestige'. 'Dunkirk' excites the senses with its ever-intensifying energy and is relentless in its barbaric portrayal of young men at war. It will, quite literally, shake you to the core.The story of 'Dunkirk' depicts the dramatic and real-life story of the Dunkirk evacuations occurring between May 26-June 4 in the spring of 1940. During this time, frequent rescue attempts of nearly 400,000 allied soldiers from Belgium, France and the British Empire were continually foiled due to being totally surrounded and cornered by the German Army at the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk, France.The film is split into three different parts: Those that are told 1. On land 2. In air and 3. At sea, though each part of the narrative is unified by a common theme: these fighters, who are all merely young men, are here to live another day, not to get to know each other. It's unique as a war drama in the sense that its purpose isn't character exposition but collective emotions, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. There is little dialogue between characters and so the question isn't: 'Who are these men?' but rather 'Will they get out alive?'Much like Memento, Nolan's themes of confusion, uncertainty and a persistent feeling of paranoia are in full throttle. The young soldiers appear in full survival mode and the directive choice by Nolan to not to delve too deep into any of their backstories (which he will likely receive backlash for) is fully understood. Let me quickly explain why.Nolan has created an atmospheric narrative, where the anguish is felt collectively in a mass effect sort of way, I think. To establish character development with any specific soldier would be superfluous and so the viewer, like the soldiers amidst battle, feels a complete lack of personalization. Or rather, the dehumanizing effects of war are made that much more vivid.Nolan's big-scale epic filmmaking (that would make David Lean proud) is a real joy with this film and has never been so evident. His avoidance of CGI and special effects make the war scenes seem as grounded as possible, presented in such a horrifyingly vivid and unapologetically realistic manner. To witness these scenes in a theater is to completely immerse yourself into the action.Couple this with yet another epic score from Hans Zimmer and you're left with an experience that hammers home the horrors of the war in such a visceral way that it has to be considered up there (already) with some of the all-time great war films like 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Platoon' and 'Apocalypse Now'. In typical Nolan-fashion, we have been given yet another unique and engrossing interpretation on a genre and we couldn't be more thankful.",9,2,9,20 July 2017
Ratatouille," A chef-d'oeuvre served by the Pixar-Disney combo
","One thing that Pixar has always done exceptionally well, and that has distinguished them as the preeminent animated storytellers (with the exception of maybe Disney and Studio Ghibli), is put the story and characters at the forefront of each of their films. One of the most fascinating legends out there is the 'Pixar Theory', which is the belief of a 'shared universe' in which all the Pixar characters, and their stories, reside in. One certainty is, however, that all Pixar films are connected by their true-to-life themes, exploring subject matter that will never manage to be obsolete and always manage to tug at those heart strings.When I first heard of 'Ratatouille', I expected the usual, formulaic Pixar routine: A mismatched pair of partners embark on an adventurous journey. There will be a colourful ensemble of supporting players amidst the 'hidden world' brought to life by everyday objects. But 'Ratatouille' took the mismatch concept to refreshingly new heights. A rat is a virtual antithesis to humans and so we are enticed by the story to show us how similar these two characters are despite their inherent differences. 'Ratatouille' is carried by great storytelling and characterization, fuelled by the instant conflict between our titular rodent, a bumbling kitchen boy and his impromptu ascension on the food chain (no pun intended). Remy (Patton Oswalt), is a Parisian rat whose dream is to be a grand chef in 'The City of Lights'. He has quite the sophisticated palate and appreciates the art of fine dining. One day he finds himself astray and arrives at one of Paris' finest restaurants. And this is where the real story begins. Could we genuinely buy into the idea that a boy can befriend and cook with a rat? Usually no but Pixar, and their exquisite weaving of such dreams, makes this feat imaginable. There is so much heart in this film and the usage of Paris as its backdrop adds a charming, exquisite touch to its telling. Remy's occasional musing gazes at the view of Paris invite us to similarly admire the visual allure Pixar has presented us with. The animation is simply superb – the dark, polluted areas where the rats reside almost feel like a separate world when entering the dazzling, colourful city-scape of the Parisian neighbourhoods. The painstaking details of the rat are also impressive, from the movements of its fur against the wind to the functioning of the rest of its body parts like its ears, nose and eyes.There is an undeniable realism felt throughout the film, largely achieved by the stellar voice acting present throughout. Patton Oswalt is someone I would not have pictured in the role as Remy but, after experiencing him, I could not have imagined anyone else capturing the pathos as well as he did. Same goes for Lou Romano, Janeane Garofalo, Brad Garrett, Ian Holm (and Peter O'Toole!). Overall, 'Ratatouille' may serve up the conventional themes we have come to expect from Pixar, but it is able to deliver them with such depth and magic that I place it on a pedestal by itself as a cinematic masterpiece. 'Ratatouille' is a dish best served to everyone!",10,2,4,28 August 2016
Dallas Buyers Club," 'I've been looking for you, lone star.'
","<a href='/title/tt0790636/'>Dallas Buyers Club (2013)</a> is a great film for so many reasons but what will win your heart over is the level of authenticity and honesty shown in the various character portrayals. McConaughey and Leto are simply spellbinding in their roles - both completely immerse themselves into both the physical and psychological state of their characters and show just what commitment to a role should look like. Together, they bring a sense of realism that elevates this biopic to first-rate material. The way both themselves, as well as their relationship with one another, evolves is a sight to be seen and done plausibly so. The on-screen text is a wise technique that makes us feel the passage of time and so we can understand how McConaughey's Woodroof has transformed from the sleazy, impudent person he was to the compassionate, altruistic individual he becomes. The movie is marvellously executed with its great writing, compelling themes and beautiful cinematography that captures the run-down, gloomy feel of the Dallas neighbourhood. It feels almost as a place of regret, where people's dreams have died in its shadowy abyss. The town's sense of lifelessness contrasts the sheer determination and vitality of Woodroof, a hero who defied all odds and whose relentless effort to merely cure himself developed into an inspiring story that showed the effect one man's resilience can have on others.",9,2,2,26 August 2016
The Exorcist," A horror masterpiece
","What can be said about this unsurpassed horror masterpiece that hasn't already been said? Perhaps the fact that it is so grounded in realism makes it the perennial kind of its genre. Some may look to the themes it so masterfully explores whether it be religion, faith, humanity, philosophy or ethics that puts it on a pedestal by itself. The spine-tingling score, one of the most memorable villains of all-time, the ominous pacing of the film - all reasons that separate this film as one of the single greatest horror films ever made.As for the performances? They are all superb and each are vitally important to the film, since so much of it is the build-up of plot, characters and setting. In fact, the titular event doesn't even occur until much later than one would think. And this is because we have a director in William Friedkin who trusts his audience to be patient in understanding the ambiguity (a little paradoxical) of the subject matter at hand. As one doctor after another continues to feed BS diagnoses to Chris MacNeil, Friedkin forces us to confront our biggest fear: the unknown. Author Andrew Smith once wrote: 'People fear what they don't understand and hate what they can't conquer.' Linda Blair as Regan MacNeil delivers one of the most chilling performances of all-time, transforming from a sweet, innocent and cheerful little girl to the definition of evil incarnate. The images of her slowly degrading condition have that raw power to stay so firmly entrenched in your mind. Ellen Burstyn as Chris MacNeil tragically conveys a mother clinging to whatever hope she has left in saving her doomed daughter. Max von Sydow and Jason Miller also give memorably powerful performances as the two Fathers, Lee J. Cobb is superb as Lt. Kinderman - to single out just one person out of this superb ensemble performance would be fatal, every individual in this film is superb!With images that have that rare power to subside and remain in your memory, The Exorcist is that special film that succeeds in being so realistic with subject matter that can be considered far from. The only other perfect horror film I can recall seeing (at least in my humble opinion) is Psycho. And though you can't compare apples and oranges, the images, music and deeper themes portrayed from both somehow manage to just stay with you; there's no other way to really put it. The Exorcist transcends the horror genre and becomes an experience, with images of beauty and terror that can never be forgotten. A deserved title of being deemed a 'classic'.",10,3,5,27 October 2017

Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Well... it's official ol buddy... we got an instant frickin' classic on our hands! 10/10 ⭐
","Believe the hype. Believe the 10 star reviews. OUATIH exceeds every expectation with its mind-blowing attention to detail, superb dialogue, incredible performances and, most of all, its overwhelming love for the movies. Tarantino's illustrious career has culminated in this stylishly nostalgic journey that takes us back to everything great about the 60s. Every detail of this period is done to a tee; and it's in all the most minute aspects, whether it be a can of dog food or a radio station, where this film is elevated to masterpiece status.Remember when Jules and Vincent instantly became one of cinemas classic duos in Pulp Fiction? You can now confidently say the same thing about Rick Dalton and Cliff Booth - Leo and Brad give performances of a lifetime as these endearing, hilarious and, at times, even heart-rending characters. They're joined by a beyond stellar supporting group that's filled beautifully by the likes of Margot Robbie, Timothy Oliphant, Al Pacino, (the late) Luke Perry, Emile Hirsch and many more who all breathe life into this wonderfully unique and engaging story.All in all, it's a fantastic dive into the Golden Age that's fulls of twists at every turn and shines even brighter in its quieter moments when it's love for everything old cinema is at the forefront of its telling. At its core, it's invigorated by a guy whose talent as a storyteller is exceeded only by his sheer love for film and that is Mr. Quentin Tarantino. And for anyone who thinks the runtime could/should have been shorter, remember that QT was trying to make many of us who had never grown up/experienced that era (like myself) feel close to it. This meant every seemingly trivial scene/moment's sole purpose was to create as authentic an atmosphere as he could've conjured up.It's as ambitious a vision as one could muster and he truly nailed it with flying colors, creating a fairytale that enthrals you in ways you never knew were possible. I hope he's lying when he says he's ready to call it quits but I'll be damned if this isn't the best way possible to go out. It's official ol buddy... we got a darn frickin classic on our hands!",10,209,378,27 July 2019
Room," A heartfelt and moving dramatic tale
","Whereas often movies will chronicle the process of being abducted, Room immediately takes us right into the lives of people who are amidst the misery. This is a poignant, harrowing film that offers a detailed account of the human condition. The essentials of human existence - like emotionality - are wholly dissected in this film. Room certainly succeeds in (believably) doing so and thereby avoids falling into a domain of superficiality where other films depicting difficult subject matter have. Seen through the eyes of an innocent child, we are reminded of the saying ignorance is bliss.Larson was absolutely phenomenal in the lead role, as supported by her deserved Academy Award for Best Actress. She convincingly immersed herself into the psyche of a woman with palpable psychological damage and did so in such an unpretentious and altruistic manner. The tenderness and motherly solicitude she displayed felt extremely genuine and almost made you forget it was a film you were experiencing. In what was a profoundly intricate character portrayal, she really delivered on this one.This was a film that heavily depended on its acting. There was no flashy CGI, no dazzling special effects - just a true-to-life story, credibly depicted. The central performances were superlative and the chemistry Larson and Tremblay showed together was remarkable. Both incredibly humanistic and exercising a compelling charm that is truly touching and hard to not feel for as you watch them evolve. The acute dialogue, the breathtaking cinematography, the excellent supporting actors, the moving score - all executed to perfection. A spectacularly crafted, must-see film.",9,1,3,9 July 2016
Dog Day Afternoon," A wonderfully peculiar illustration of Murphy's Law
","Sidney Lumet, the legendary director of 12 Angry Men and Network, is operating at the upper echelon of his ability in Dog Day Afternoon. Based on a true story of a bank hostage situation gone incredibly wrong, this film shows us that 'anything that can go wrong, will go wrong.' This film is brilliantly conceived with much of the brilliance stemming from the sheer quirkiness displayed at every turn. The script (which earned Frank Pierson an Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay) is extraordinarily nuanced and brought to life by many electric performances from its cast.Al Pacino is magnificent as Sonny Wortzik, the inexperienced, bumbling criminal. He absolutely throws himself into Sonny's mind and perfectly captures even the smaller mannerisms and body language that likely go unnoticed by many. His wired eyes sharply contrast his physical state of exhaustion and you physically observe the fatigue both Pacino and his character are enduring throughout this film. Ultimately, you feel for Sonny because Pacino is able to masterfully force his vulnerability and compassion - the humanistic side of him - into some semblance of bravado. In scenes like when a teller needs to go to the washroom or when the bank guard has an asthma attack, Sonny shows a genuinely caring side to him. This is a bad man performing an act of evil and, yet, we feel some degree of sympathy for what Sonny has endured until this point. Along for the heist is Sal (played by John Cazale), who regrets his involvement in it all the second the two step foot into the bank. The man was simply excellent in every film he was in.Overall, this film is a masterpiece from a director who was always so deft at using the camera to feel like a kind of onlooker; as it subtly observes the events unfolding before it, we too are immersed into the story and thus given a more tangible, relatable story. Like in 12 Angry Men, we are not a moviegoer; but rather a silent bystander enduring the tense, overheated conditions with its characters. And of course, further life is breathed into the plot by excellent supporting performances including those from Charles Durning, Chris Surandon and James Broderick. An entertaining and perfectly executed story.",8,1,2,25 July 2016
The Hurt Locker," The Hurt Locker - A conflict of men and self
","The Hurt Locker is an engrossing tour de force that manages to keep your eyes glued to the screen for its 131 minute run time. The pacing and story, in particular, are fantastic (as supported by the several academy awards it amassed including best picture and best film editing). I would have to consider it up there with cinematic, war-based giants like Apocalypse Now, Saving Private Ryan and Full Metal Jacket.This in-depth look into the lives of members of a bomb-disposal unit in Baghdad is a viscerally exciting and enthralling experience. Unlike many movies nowadays that succumb to the 'repetitive formula' of grand explosions and special effects that many of us have come to expect, The Hurt Locker almost feels more like individual character studies than a war film. The soldiers and their emotions are the central focus amid each battle sequence, with the action used to develop further their characterization rather than trivialize it.To keep it short, director Kathryn Bigelow effectively immerses the audience with masterful work from cinematographer Barry Ackroyd. Together, they manage to create an atmospheric concoction of perpetual suspense, fear and exhilaration. Masterful performances delivered by Mackie, Renner and Geraghty (as well as some awesome, albeit short-lived performances from Ralph Fiennes and Guy Pearce). A definite must-see film, one that transcends the norm of the action-driven genre. Absolutely deserved of Best Picture Winner at the 82 Academy Awards (even though, funnily enough, it was actually made in 2008, two years before winning best picture in 2010).",9,2,4,2 July 2016
Patton," George C. Scott gives a performance for the ages
","<a href='/name/nm0001715/'>George C. Scott</a> portraying real-life war icon General George S. Patton Jr. is simply outstanding in the role. The screenplay (helmed by <a href='/name/nm0000338/'>Francis Ford Coppola</a>) paints the character as a controversial man whose life's focus was on war and nothing else. Scott plays the role with a tremendous amount of brutality and confidence and really carries the entire film.

The Curious Case of Benjamin Button," An ambitious and beautiful piece of storytelling from Fincher - 8/10 ⭐
","Wow, this was such a breath of fresh air and such a different vibe than we're used to getting from Fincher. The visual effects and production design were incredible; no surprise the film picked up the Oscar for both categories. Brad Pitt is just sublime in the role, displaying a sensitivity and vulnerability well beyond his years (no pun intended). Every performance is wonderful and the message at its core of seizing opportunities while we still can surely resonated. Wonderfully atmospheric music as well... it might be a taaad too long but overall I genuinely loved the story and if you check it out, you might just too. Well done to everyone involved here!",8,1,6,27 September 2019
1917," Mendes/Deakins have set a new standard for war movies with this incredible piece of filmmaking - 9/10 ⭐
","Easily 2 of the most gripping hours in a theater I've experienced all year. Through a series of extended shots made to look like one continuous take, we follow (without breathers) Lance Corporal Blake and Schofield through a visceral and relentless journey during WWI. In addition to top notch direction, set design and music, I'm left with just two words: Roger. Deakins. The man is simply the greatest cinematographer to have ever lived and here he captures nothing short of technical brilliance. The man deserves b2b Oscars for this masterpiece!",9,5,13,9 January 2020
Pi," A promising start for one of the most talented directors of our generation
","Unsettling, creepy, tense, surreal. The film is quite similar to <a href='/title/tt0074486/'>Eraserhead (1977)</a>, another feature debut of a director (<a href='/name/nm0000186/'>David Lynch</a>) whose surrealism and otherworldly visuals would become a massive trademark. It was a promising start for Aronofsky, who would go on to create many now iconic films that were incredibly unique in storytelling and visual imagery. Nice one 👍",7,2,2,16 May 2019
Mulholland Drive," A truly unique and dreamlike viewing experience
","I can honestly say after watching <a href='/title/tt0166924/'>Mulholland Dr. (2001)</a> that I've never seen anything quite like this... it helps to come into this film with the sole expectation that you are entering a dreamworld. Rather than being presented a straightforward plot with conventional tropes and rules, we are given from Lynch a succession of images, ideas and sensations - in that sense, <a href='/title/tt0166924/'>Mulholland Dr. (2001)</a> really feels closer to a dream than a movie.To say that <a href='/name/nm0000186/'>David Lynch</a> has a unique cinematic style would be an understatement - as a result, his films can be extremely hit or miss with people. But here, everything just seems to come together so well - the disquieting music coupled with the dreamlike surroundings creates a nightmarish and otherworldly environment to which you simply become a part of. Lynch re-creates the place we all see in our dreams that feels so real and yet is only a part of our subconscious.There are many highlights in the film (the acting from <a href='/name/nm0915208/'>Naomi Watts</a> and <a href='/name/nm0005009/'>Laura Harring</a> specifically is outstanding) but what resonated the most with me was the beautiful imagery Lynch has crafted in this film. Ambitious in its deliberate approach to avoid conventional plot elements, the pieces of the film are so hard to put together that trying to do so would simply be futile. People have tried to solve its mysteries and contrivances but MD is meant to be left in its bare, enigmatic fragments. Upon finishing the film, I was left with the same feeling I have waking up from an amazing dream: Unsure of what I had witnessed but stuck reminiscing at the mystery and beauty of it all. And until this point, I had never seen anything quite like this surreal, neo-noir experience. I seriously doubt I will ever come across anything like it again. This is great filmmaking by Lynch and his indisputable masterpiece.",9,7,10,12 October 2017
Grave of the Fireflies," An incredibly moving and brutally honest masterpiece
","I just finished watching Grave of the Fireflies and wow. Just wow. I am at a complete lost for words. Until this point, I had only watched a few animes but this heart-rending tale isn't your typical animated film. No, it is SO much more. It has unexpected depth. It has soul. It has a genuine message that shan't be overlooked.This is an extremely poignant and moving story about a young boy and his little sister struggling to survive in Japan during World War II. Above all, it is based on experience, situation and exploration. And this film offers us a tragic look into real atrocities, real horrors from the perspectives of two joyful kids, Seita and Setsuko. They share a magnificently uplifting and eternal connection (the latter quite literally, as many would argue) that makes you feel all kinds of warm inside just watching them interact with one another.The animation in this film is simply breathtaking. The painstaking attention to detail, particularly with the surrounding landscape is awe-inspiring. Certain images like the luminous fireflies at night, the glistening pond outside where Seita and Setsuko reside and the beach they visit with its magnificent sunset will resonate with me for a long time. It is hard not to appreciate animation of such quality and finesse.The impact of this film is heightened with a mesmerizing score and the introspective pauses that are not only tolerated, but encouraged, in Japanese animation films. Majestic sounds used throughout also add to this captivating, almost dreamlike vibe. And yet, it was the true to life storytelling that made this film such a realistic, enchanting piece of art.I was somewhat confused of the beginning without any context and I later re-watched it after the film's end. It is a beautiful beginning (or rather end) and makes you appreciate the film even more than you thought you did. This wonderfully crafted film deserves a viewing from anyone at least once. It is not simply a movie about war per se, but about the beauty of life and the blissful ignorance of youth.",10,4,5,20 July 2016
Cold War," Gorgeously shot and emotionally-charged Polish film
","Loosely inspired by the turbulent relationship of Polish filmmaker <a href='/name/nm0667734/'>Pawel Pawlikowski</a>, <a href='/title/tt6543652/'>Zimna wojna (2018)</a> tells the emotional love story between a music director, Wiktor, and a young singer, Zula.

Incredibly lead performances and some beautiful music as well, this film easily becomes one of my top films of 2018. It's seriously that good!",8,2,4,20 May 2019
La La Land," The stuff that dreams are made of...
","'La La Land' is the kind of movie that you can't help but fall in love with for the sheer energy that oozes out of every frame, every note and every second its on the screen. It really puts you into an inexplicable kind of trance, you become completely lost in its lust and aesthetic beauty. Director Damien Chazelle, already the youngest winner of the Best Director Award in the history of the Golden Globes, may very well accomplish the same feat tomorrow at the Oscars. The premise of the film is simple: A jazz pianist falls for an aspiring actress in Los Angeles. We've heard it before, but what 'La La Land' actually creates with a rather hackneyed plot line is anything but unoriginal. In fact, Chazelle deserves a ton of credit for creating a completely original musical, one that bursts with toe-tappingly poetic songs and melodies that will be entrenched in people's mind for a long time. He even pays homage to the more classic films of the Hollywood Golden Age by showing us alternate endings (many films of that era were known to film two endings) but how Chazelle masterfuly juxtaposes the fiction to reality merits an Oscar alone.Aside from the incredible acting, cinematography and writing, one thing I must comment on about 'La La Land' is the beautiful jazz score. This soundtrack is near close to perfect, especially for those that adore jazz. It perfectly encapsulates all those idealist thoughts people have when daydreaming about cities like LA or NYC. Have you ever listened to jazz music and, to quote fellow IMDb user ElMaruecan82, just felt nostalgic over a time you weren't even born in? Like 'La La Land', Jazz has all the elements that pulls you in as a viewer: it has melody, it has harmony, it has rhythm, but most of all, it has soul. And boy, does this film have soul. It's energy is relentless and simply undeniable.Coupled with the beautiful musical score and exceptionally well written songs ('City of Stars', in particular, is enchanting) is first-rate acting by Gosling and Stone. Gosling can really do so many roles but where I find him most effective is in his minimalism - he's really one of few actors who can show so much with so little. His subtlety and nuances create such depth and mystery in a character like Sebastien you could find yourself spending hours pondering over what he is merely thinking. Stone was great as well, seemingly effortless in her ability to project a charm and likability. Together, their chemistry was electric; they really just looked like they were having a great time out there (for anyone who says they couldn't dance/sing well).Honestly, I could go on for days about the magic of this film and this likely won't be the final copy of this review for reasons of continuing to think over and re-phrase my thoughts of the film; I get what people are saying about how the film finds a way to stick in your head. Case in point, 'La La Land' is the stuff that dreams are made of. And whether you're part of the group that despises the film or not, one can't deny the elegance, style and melodic magic the film possesses, and the ability it has to totally immerse you in all its jazzy glory; and isn't that, by some measure, what any film really aspires to do?",10,7,12,26 February 2017
A Clockwork Orange," What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again!
","Out of all the Kubrick masterpieces I have seen, A Clockwork Orange had the greatest impact on me. Firstly, the film is a visual treat for the eyes. Kubrick's meticulousness to every detail is manifest, visually striking with its futuristic feel and surreal imagery. The set pieces were among the best I've seen in a movie and beautifully captured the movie's essence.While labelled a dystopian film, there is an undeniable Black Comedy element to it as well. Whether it was our 'friend and humble narrator' presenting his 'rendition' of 'Singin' In the Rain', propositioning a couple of women at the record store or even the mere conversations he would have with his 'droogs', the humour was always a perfect contrast to the difficult subject matter being depicted throughout.What more can be said of Malcolm McDowell's breathtaking turn as the charismatic hooligan of young Alex DeLarge? As the narrator, protagonist and antihero, Alex is an ultra- violent sociopath who assaults people for sheer satisfaction. Violence is the engine that fuels this enigmatic man. This is why his quasi-transformed self is all the more astonishing, and allows McDowell to show off his immense versatility as an actor.While watching the film, I couldn't help but notice many connections between ACO and Breaking Bad. So I did my research and it turns out other people have too noticed the similitude. Mr. Alexander, in his final appearance, closely resembling that of drug runner Hector Salamanca being one. The scene of Walt casually strolling around in the home of Gretchen and Elliott Schwartz to the echo of classical music likely alluding to the Beethoven music torture scene. And of course, the unmistakable parallels between each of our anti- heros. Each so dark and morally questionable, fuelled by violence and the fear they instill in others. Not since Walter White had I met such a fascinating character with the uncanny ability to delude himself about the truth of his actions. With both W.W. and Alex DeLarge, you find yourself hating that you love them. Their evolution is so out of character, and yet you can't help but root for them because they are, quite frankly, so damn badass. But most of all neither, in the end, really transformed at all.",9,2,5,10 July 2016
The Shape of Water," Exhilarating and enchanting... I'd say Del Toro's finest piece of art.
","This fantasy drama tale by the always inventive <a href='/name/nm0868219/'>Guillermo del Toro</a> is an absolute joy to experience. The performances, screenplay, direction, cinematography and production design are all, simply, phenomenal. It also boasts a beautifully transportive original score composed by <a href='/name/nm0006035/'>Alexandre Desplat</a> that perfectly captures the magic and spirit of this beautiful story. One needn't look too hard to see that this was Del Toro's passion project; and it shows in every frame. Experience this in a theatre and let it carry you away into its fascinating world for 2 hours. If you truly give yourself to it, you may just find yourself sitting there, smiling with that rare feeling of warmth a movie can elicit. This film is the shape of dreams...",9,47,90,21 February 2018
The Untouchables," Solid gangster flick from De Palma
","<a href='/title/tt0094226/'>The Untouchables (1987)</a> is a solid gangster film despite its often simplistic and clichéd take on the genre. It's entertaining, boasts a solid cast and succeeds in showing the grittiness of the Prohibition Era.For me, these were the standout moments of the film:
<ul><li>The stairway shootout - probably the best scene in the film.</li><li>De Niro's take on Al Capone - though I wish he was given a little more screen time and the audience was given a little more insight into the character.</li><li>A beautiful musical score from the legendary <a href='/name/nm0001553/'>Ennio Morricone</a>.</li></ul>",7,3,4,11 April 2019
Die Hard," Few have lived up this thrilling story
","Die Hard still remains, to this day, one of the best action films of all time. Directed by John McTiernan (The Hunt for Red October, Predator) and written by Jeb Stuart (The Fugitive), the story packs a great amount of action and suspense with memorably immortal characters.The acting: This was the film that propelled Bruce Willis to absolute stardom. Starring as the charismatic Officer John McClane of the NYPD, Willis lacks the Schwarzenegger-esque physique but shows us you don't need bulging muscles to defeat your foes. Rather, he is presented as the everyday Joe who is thrust into a flurry of German terrorists. His screen presence is strong throughout, with his witty one-liners (Yippy-Ki-yay, motha*****) and believable character development. There are smaller details presented where Willis reveals more of a vulnerable side to him (usually when he is alone) that perfectly contrasts his 'cop machismo'. As he barely escapes one threat presented after another, we are reminded that this is a normal guy in a highly abnormal situation.Another character who absolutely owns his screen time is Hans Gruber, played by an electric Alan Rickman. He gives a spectacular performance as the leader of the terrorists - conniving, intelligent and also has a comical side. His subtly sinister demeanor keeps us on the edge of our seat and we relish his every move. Perhaps that is why Die Hard has succeeded where so many other action films have failed. We are equally engrossed by both the virtuous and villainous figures presented.The screenplay: Taking place in predominantly one area for the majority of the film, Die Hard delivers one taut thrill after another. The sense of realism and grittiness does not seem too far-fetched, even for an action flick. The explosions are not superfluous and the gore is not unnecessary – it all helps in developing McClaine's character and shows us the right extent of how chaotic things become for him.I particularly loved the meta-humor ('This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly.' 'That was Gary Cooper, a**hole.') And banter was common in this film, whether it being between Hans and John, John and Office Powell. The superb dialogue, acting and direction manage to elevate this film an echelon above its action-film wannabes.",10,4,4,5 August 2016
Sausage Party," Hilarious, raunchy and, yes, cleverly written
","After watching Sausage Party, one thing is certain - You will never look at your food the same way again. In this film, Rogen and Co. employ all their humorous tricks in the book to bring to life a highly original idea. Along for the ride are fellow comedic gems including Jonah Hill, James Franco and Kristen Wiig to boot.The film tells the story of a world of anthropomorphized food in the fictional grocery store Shopwellers. Life is great for all the food items, whose dreams are to meet the 'gods' and to (relish?) the life outside their confined shelves. But when Frank the sausage learns the truth of their fate as human meals, he must warn the rest of the food items and find a way to escape and find their elusive freedom, free from humans.The plot sounds ridiculous and it is even more over the top than one might expect it to be, especially those last 30 minutes or so. The amount of crude humour and constant innuendos keep its free flowing story a hilarious one. But for a film that centres around food, there exists a great level humanity embedded in its plethora of characters, who are as endearing as they are vulgar, filled with the same urges, ambitions and fears that any normal person would have.With its constant food puns and raunchy humour, it certainly isn't for everyone. But Sausage Party is special - it offers both humour and substance, some food for thought if you will. It has an extraordinary charm stemming from its lovable characters and occasional nuanced moments. A seemingly shallow storyline delves much deeper into the concept of religion, hope and perspective. The idea is highly original and provides a surprising dose of pathos and provoking moments.An 'ate'/10 for me.",6,19,43,13 August 2016
Joker," Brilliant character study and goes to dark place most films wouldn't dare to - 9/10 🃏
","I have so many thoughts on this film and it truly does take you to places most films wouldn't dare. It takes its time in developing a truly dark, brooding atmosphere and fleshes out the full extent it can take to truly push one to the edge. And those last twenty minutes or so... just speechless. Loved the direction by Phillips, the music, the homage to older Hollywood filmmaking and the brilliantly engrossing character study. Bravo Joaquin - I, and it seems like many people here on IMDb, will surely be rooting for you come Oscar season. It truly feels like his entire career has led to this moment - undoubtedly a performance for the ages!",9,2,4,1 November 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," To Kill a Mockingbird - 10/10
","Adapted to the big screen from Harper Lee's groundbreaking novel To Kill A Mockingbird, Robert Mulligan's dramatic masterpiece is one that truly improves with age. The film begins and ends with narrative from the youngest daughter of the film's protagonist, Jean Louise, or more commonly referred to throughout the film as 'Scout', portrayed by Mary Badham. The focus of the movie shifts, however, and is seen through the lens many of the films beloved characters. To Kill A Mockingbird was actually the film debut of both Mary Badham and Philip Alford, who played Scout and Jem Finch, respectively. Both played their role with considerable charm and amiability, slowly learning of and becoming accustomed to the bigotry of their community. Roger Ebert, my undisputed, and certainly many others, favorite film critic, uncharacteristically gave a review for the film many of his readers disagreed with. Ebert gave the film 2 1/2 stars out of his usual 4 star rating, indicative of an adequate but not a particularly great film. Roger criticized the film's tendency to marginalize the stories of some of the black characters and, at times, replace their characterization with more of a focus, if at times even superfluously, on the white characters. For example, the wife of Tom Robinson is a character who perhaps we could have gained more insight from, or any at all for that matter. She was credited with a non-speaking role, rendering her character and development a bit of an enigma when the film is finally over.I found myself unable to agree with Robert on this one, something I have never said in the past. Many agreeing with Robert's opinion on the film's characterization, or perhaps lack thereof, might also refer to the scenes following the deliberation process in the courtroom, where we learn that Tom is unjustly served a guilty verdict despite an astute, and ingenious, effort from Atticus to prove his innocence. Atticus receives a call later that night that Tom was shot down and killed after trying to run away from the cops 'like a crazy man'. Atticus accepts this and doesn't question its validity; at least, on screen he doesn't. Could he have so much as inferred otherwise? Definitely. In fact, while the film doesn't make it apparent, it's very possible Atticus believes the death of Tom Robinson was an act of unprovoked aggression. We are never told of this and it is ultimately up to us to decide what Atticus believes. I believe the omission of many details relating to many of the black characters was a choice by director Robert Muligan that one shan't take at face value. Under the surface, is it too contrived to think that this perceived 'neglect' to character development could be akin to how both the case, and Tom Robinson, were neglected? That, just like the portrayal of these characters, the verdict leaves us wanting more of an explanation and of details that, because of its time, will be tailored to favor the white man? Perhaps this is too far-fetched, but nonetheless an interesting idea to ponder. Gregory Peck deservedly earned his Oscar, one of many stellar performances. The kids portrayed by Badham and Alford were phenomenal as well, especially when you remember this was their debut on the big screen. Tom Robinson, played by Brock Peters, elicited hope from us as the viewers that he would be 'saved'. He gave a moving performance, one that I worry will go unappreciated in many moviegoers' eyes. Robert Duvall also made his debut in this film as Boo Radley, played to perfection. Estelle Evans as Calpurnia, James Anderson as Bob Ewell also shine. There were simply many great performances that masterfully captured the essence, and abhorrent nature, of that time. One of my favorite films from the golden age and one that will certainly resonate with many for a long time.",10,1,3,30 June 2016
The Reader," An unforgettable and moving read
","There is something extremely dangerous about internalizing the shame or embarrassment a person might have. They can act stoic, sure, but eventually what they tried to suppress will come back to them and at that point, it becomes all the more difficult to finally confront those demons when it does. 'The Reader' shows us just how damaging such secrets can be, not only for the person keeping them, but also to whom they're keeping them from.Its story is told in three distinct parts by Michael, including flashbacks that begin at the time when he was a reserved 15-year old kid, falling ill, being helped by and setting eyes on Hanna for the very first time. Their ensuing romantic relationship is a complex one - enigmatic but endearing, abnormal on paper but validated by the fervent, undeniable lust they show for one another. The conflicting forces of their bond are, in a way, what seemingly draws the two together. Below the surface, however, it would appear that their vulnerability plays an important part in it as well.The film is not unpredictable per se, in that certain elements of the film, like Hanna's feelings towards Michael, are viewed skeptically due to 1. The inherent peculiarity of their situation and 2. Winslet's extraordinarily nuanced demeanour. Our consciousness of the situation allows us to more clearly analyze and understand it and so we are granted the time, amidst their time together, to ponder the psyche of each individual. This element, of its subtext being masked by a rather straightforward situation, makes 'The Reader' all the more thought-provoking and powerful.The direction and writing also play an integral role in bringing out the humanity of its characters. The shift in tone, beginning with its brevity and high pace, then gradually slipping to a more pensive, poignant feel, effectively divides its story into its own distinct parts but manages to flow seamlessly by the weight of its characters emotions that seem to never relent and so humanely evolve. This is thanks to masterful performances by David Cross, Ralph Fiennes and, of course, Kate Winslet.The story of Hanna Schmitz is reflective, regretful and truly heartbreaking, as we watch her being slowly swept away by the uncompromising ugliness that stems from keeping her own her secrets. Perhaps confessing to her shortcomings may serve as the proverbial key to her freedom, but it is ultimately her shame which has imprisoned her for life. And in that sense, she can never truly be freed, only endure what has irreparably damaged her for so many years.",9,2,3,24 August 2016
Parasite," A masterpiece as both a social commentary and cinematic experience...and one of this year's best! 9/10 ⭐
","In the latest film of Bong Joon-Ho (<a href='/title/tt0353969/'>Salinui chueok (2003)</a>, <a href='/title/tt1706620/'>Snowpiercer (2013)</a>), we are given a story that, in a brilliant turn of events, sees the day-to-day lives of two Korean families intertwined. These families couldn't be more dissimilar; one makes money from folding pizza boxes & steals the wifi of nearby cafes while the other lives like royalty, served by maids and taken around by drivers.The income disparity is quickly made apparent to us and in a string of events I don't want to spoil here, the poorer family finds themselves usurping one role at a time of the richer family until they all find themselves employed by the rich. And yet they have to act like total strangers with one another. How this is all written, directed and acted plays off incredibly well.'Parasite' really surprised me in that it takes you on a whirlwind of emotions. It's storytelling is ambitious and takes chances in veering off-tone and off-the-book, so to speak. I found myself dying of laughter at some parts, tense or sad at others and purely enchanted throughout. All of this while showcasing some of the most unique storytelling I've ever witnessed.Certain to nab a Best Foreign Film nomination at the Academy Awards and perhaps even a Best Director & Best Picture nod, 'Parasite' is certainly one of the year's best. Arguably even one the decade's best. It's all in the little details whether it's using a keen sense of lighting, composition or blocking to reveal something. Give this one a watch and you'll see what I mean. Masterpiece!",9,4,10,1 November 2019
Platoon," Up there with Apocalypse Now and FMJ as one of the best films to depict the horrors of the Vietnam war...
","... and for good reason! Platoon is a unique war film in that it almost plays out as more of a morality tale and the inner conflict that eats away at the insides of man rather than focusing primarily on the conflict with the enemies. In Stone's film, we are given in-depth examinations into both the atrocities of the war and those committed by the Staff Sergeant supposedly on the 'good side' of it all. Played to perfection by Tom Berenger. his terrifying portrayal of a heartless Sgt. becomes all the more frightening when contrasted with the compassionate, caring nature of Sgt. Elias, portrayed by William Dafoe. The film is unapologetically outspoken in its depiction of the horrors soldiers faced in the war and with razor-edged editing that nabbed Academy Award honors, it really does immerse you, almost uncomfortably so, in the hell these men endure. One of the best.",9,7,9,28 April 2017
Marriage Story," An incredibly raw and heart-rending story anchored by two wonderful lead performances - 9/10 ⭐
",Sometimes two good people just aren't 'good' for each other. I learned this from my parents who separated albeit very amicably. <a href='/title/tt7653254/'>Marriage Story (2019)</a> shows us just how ugly a journey this can become when things become contested and compromising turns to competing. Noah Baumbach has crafted an extremely raw and poignant screenplay (based off of his experiences with Jennifer Jason Leigh) and both Scarlett Jo and Adam Driver give absolutely lights-out performances; career highs for both of them in my opinion. This one deserves all the awards it has coming - Don't miss it.,9,5,8,9 December 2019
Mary and Max," Mary and Max - A tale of friendship
","'The reason I forgive you is because you are not perfect. You are imperfect. And so am I. All humans are imperfect.' It is pretty rare to connect so deeply with an animated film. The animated aspect can often serve as a barrier that prevents people from deeply identifying with the characters they are witnessing on screen and therefore prevents them from deeply caring for them. With Mary and Max, this couldn't be farther from the truth. This is a film that I think I, and many others, will remember for a long time.This film is a poignant clay-animation film that records the 20 year relationship between two social eccentrics. Mary Daisy Dinkle (voiced by Bethany Whitmore as a child and Toni Colette as an adult), is a lonely 8 year old who lives in Austrailia who loves condensed milk, her pet rooster and a smurfs-like show called The Noblets. At school, she is teased because of having an unlucky birthmark on her forehead. Max Jerry Horowitz (voiced by Philip Seymour Hoffman) is a morbidly obese, 44 year old formerly Jewish atheist who, due to mental and social problems, has trouble forming close bonds with people. Their lives both change when Mary fortuitously choose a fellow lonely soul to write to. The quirkiness that separated them in society ultimately links these two pen pals together.The creative idea to use Claymation helps the audience in seeing the films protagonists not merely as characters but as fellow human beings. This is further established by the strong, and true to life, humanization this film creates of its characters. Upon viewing, it is clear that director Adam Elliot's masterful creation was a painstaking process, further solidified when the viewer take one look at the beautiful landscape showcased in each frame of this film. Every detail is manually drawn up with considerable care and beauty (according to Elliot, every detail!). Elliot calls his films Clayography, a portmanteau for 'clay animated biography', each taking 5 years to materialize.In short, the story is a bittersweet tale of friendship that will have you in a mix of emotions come the movie's end. My simply writing about the enthralling animation and creative brilliance would not do this wonderful film justice; it is simply, to recite a common cliché, a matter of experiencing it yourself to fully appreciate it. A film that can so deftly juxtapose its humorous and heartbreaking moments are so rare and Mary and Max seems to be able to pull this off so effortlessly. The witty dialogue, the majestic narration of Barry Humphries, the transient theme music - that almost reminds me of the Friday Night Lights intro song, in the sense that it takes you on a roller coaster of emotions that includes happiness, sadness, hope, regret in its short duration.Philip Seymour Hoffman deserves a lot of praise for how he approached Max's character. His voice was tailored perfectly to that of Max's appearance, from the accent to the tone in which he spoke. He brought a certain poignancy and virtue to the character, giving life to one of the most memorable characters I can remember in recent animation. Even knowing it was him behind the character of Max, I couldn't wrap my head around it. He was truly one of the most diverse actors of our generation and he will forever be missed by many, whether it being his presence on the big screen or merely his voice.It is a shame that the idea of animation movies might dissuade many people from experiencing this movie. At its core, this film is beautiful in all of its forms – direction, narration, acting and, of course, animation. It manages to be humorous, melancholy, hopeful and a million other things all in one. It excels in staying true to the human condition and does not in any way try to patronize the characters or idealize their situations; it is, in simplest terms, real. My words cannot do this film justice; it was and will continue to serve as one of the finest animations brought to life. 10/10",10,5,8,30 June 2016
Mother!," The more you think about it... the more you realize...
","Nightmarish and otherworldly, <a href='/name/nm0004716/'>Darren Aronofsky</a> stunned the cinematic world with this 'unconventional' psychological thriller that tells the story of a mysterious couple who are one day interrupted by an even more mysterious couple. With serious biblical undertones and a general sense of unease, this allegorical film is certainly one of its kind. It's bold, and so weird (so very weird) but it's different and original, so you gotta give credit to Aronofsky for taking an extremely unique approach in storytelling in a day and age where originality seems to be as far off as ever. Watch at your own discretion!",6,3,8,19 February 2018
Jojo Rabbit," Inventive, hilarious and original - 'Jojo' is a ballsy film that works because of its wit and heart - 8/10 ⭐
","I was fortunate enough to catch <a href='/name/nm0169806/'>Taika Waititi</a>'s latest film at the 2019 TIFF People's Choice Screening and what an absolute treat it was. In this 'anti-hate satire', we follow the trials and tribulations of a German boy who finds a Jewish girl living in his attic and is confronted with a clash of his conditioned values as a little nazi boy. If you think the synopsis sounds crazy, you have no idea what you're in for...Though seemingly taking inspiration from the works of Wes Anderson and Mel Brooks, 'Jojo' manages to create something in an entirely new ball park pulling off a spoof that manages to be hilarious while not disrespecting its touchy subject matter, a feat that only the wonderful Taika (who directed, wrote and acted as Imaginary Hitler in) could pull off so well. The film also boasts some killer cinematography as well as a wonderful soundtrack, both of which punctuate some of the films quieter moments to ground us in the era and atmosphere of the film.As mentioned above, Taiki plays the titular boy's imaginary Hitler friend and leaves you weak in the stomach from laughing so much - he's, quite simply, hilarious. And yet, he doesn't manage to overpower the rest of the cast which includes Sam Rockwell, Scarlett Jo and Rebel Wilson all of whom are wonderful. But most notably, it's the child performances that take center stage. The two little leads are incredible, making us laugh at times, shed a tear at others and just feel for the two of them. Their comedic timing, range and overall performances are done to a T - it's because of them the film works as well as it does.In today's day and age, more than ever, people need a reason to just sit back and smile and this makes 'Jojo Rabbit' a truly timely film. Leave it to Mr. Waititi to take one of the most gruesome periods in human history and, believe it or not, find both a humour and beauty in its telling. It's also entirely original in its execution and is perhaps the perfect example of the kind of film Hollywood could use more of. All that's left to say is thanks for the laughs Taika; and for your brilliantly twisted mind!",8,135,223,16 September 2019
The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King," An epic and spectacular climax to the greatest film trilogy ever created... just pure genius...
","What a breathtaking end to an epic saga that will go down in cinematic history as the best trilogy that was ever created (if it hasn't already). The culmination of 10 years' work and the final chapter of Peter Jackson fantasy adventure film series, The Return of The King fires on all cylinders, as we follow our favorite middle earth characters in a larger- than-life journey that will lead to the final confrontation between the forces of good and evil. Whereas in FOTR and The Two Towers when we were still learning about our characters and their surroundings, everything about the ring's importance and power is unleashed in this third installment and to great effect.With the exception of maybe only The Godfather Trilogy, the LOTR film series is indisputably the greatest in film history (it was only the second sequel to nab a Best Picture Oscar, the only other being -you guessed it- The Godfather Part II). And what more can actually be said? The breathtaking visuals, the outstanding character development, the epic musical score, gorgeous set designs, the plethora of visually striking creatures - there's never been anything quite like this on screen before. And there never will be again! Never has a film balanced electrifying action and substantial character development so deftly while also staying true to the original source material. It will never cease to amaze me how this was all brought to life. Through this trilogy, Jackson presents us with an unprecedented odyssey of friendship, loyalty, bravery, self-realization and so many other things. In the beginning, we are introduced to a fellowship of 9 individuals who are given the seemingly impossible task of taking the one ring to the blood-curdling world of Mordor with the goal of destroying it and saving middle earth in the process. Over the course of 3 films, our characters learn so much about themselves, about what it means to fight for what you believe in and for something bigger than then yourselves. These themes, and the scale they're presented on, completely transcend the idea of a movie and almost operate on a more biblical and spiritual fashion. And perhaps no film franchise has given us so many memorable characters as LOTR: Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimil, Boromir, Gandalf, Elrond, Galadriel, Arwen, Eowyn and countless more. And that's JUST the good guys. We are also given such memorable villains as Gollum, Sauron and Saruman, in addition to the plethora of evil Orcs, Goblins, Demons, Dragons and other horrifying beings. If you think this sounds like a lot, nothing can prepare you for the sheer scope and vast vision of Jackson and his team. The franchise also has some of the most powerful cinematic moments I can recall from the last 40 years (Gandalf yelling 'You Shall Not Pass!', The Battle of Helms Deep, Sam carrying Frodo up Mount Doom). Iconic doesn't do this franchise justice; it's legendary and it's immortal. It's Lord of the F****** Rings!Above all, Jackson stays true to the major themes and philosophies from the original source material while showcasing his extraordinary cinematic talent and vision. ROTK defines what a 'fantasy' epic should be and becomes so much more in the process; it's a resonant coming-of-age story and a masterpiece of storytelling and filmmaking. There just aren't enough superlatives for this film. And for this trilogy. And when you do finish it all for the first time, you'll be left sitting there with a feeling of emptiness for having left this magical world but a satisfaction in realizing you just witnessed one of the all-time greatest films and trilogies ever put to celluloid. What a crowning achievement by every single person involved.",10,9,13,15 October 2017
Heat," A film that 'fires' on all cylinders. And it just gets better with age.
","Think about the best heist films, or mere scenes, that you've ever seen and look no further than this film as one of the chief inspirations for them. <a href='/title/tt0113277/'>Heat (1995)</a>, the legendary crime-thriller film directed and written by <a href='/name/nm0000520/'>Michael Mann</a> (<a href='/title/tt0369339/'>Collateral (2004)</a>, <a href='/title/tt0140352/'>The Insider (1999)</a>), is a tour- de-force of direction, acting and creating an atmosphere of sheer anticipation. Perhaps most surprising is its zero Oscar nominations - easily could there have been nods for Best Picture, Lead/Supporting Actor/Actress, Director and Screenplay. Since I have seen it, there has been one scene in particular that's stayed etched in my mind and I need not regurgitate its specifics here. But anyone whose seen it remembers that legendary scene when our hero and villain finally confront one another - it's a beautiful piece of on-screen acting and features a conversation whose subtext really defines the film in a nutshell; all these guys know is the jobs they've committed too, and they're both darn good at them. 'If it's between you and some poor bastard whose wife you're gonna widow. Brother you are going down.' The story is certainly a complex one because there is an undeniable sense a comraderie between Lt. Hanna and Mccauley and yet they know the second they step out of that restaurant, they're each other's prey and target. One senses it's too late for either of these guys to get out before it's too late and that is really one of the themes of the film; at one point can one be able to walk away from all they know?I ramble on about this scene but the entire film is a masterpiece of its type - compelling performances, a tightly-wrapped story and top-notch direction. There's meticulousness to how everyone operates and that craft is shown to near perfection - it's a nod to the pacing as well that the three hour run time feels closer to two. This is one of the greats in a superb decade for crime films.",9,2,3,13 November 2017
Annihilation," Equal parts ambitious and convuluted, but this very well could become a sci-fi classic in the future...
","Annihilation is an ambitious, visually stunning and yet sometimes convoluted sci-fi flick. The visuals are absolutely breathtaking, however, and those final 20 minutes or so are pretty mind-blowing, owing its inspiration to sci-fi classics like <a href='/title/tt0062622/'>2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)</a> and <a href='/title/tt0078748/'>Alien (1979)</a>. It's grasp on atmosphere is impressive and like a any good sci-fi film should, it elicits plenty of food for thought on humanity and existence. Could definitely become a classic in the future.",7,2,4,10 March 2019
Slumdog Millionaire," A highly exhilarating and emotionally uplifting story
","Danny Boyle's 'Slumdog Millionaire' is an enthralling dramatic film with ingenious storytelling methods. Similar to The Life of Pi, another highly acclaimed film set in India which also includes Irffan Khan, we are given a story that chronicles the life journey of a young, orphaned Indian boy, one that does so with such a majestic, albeit harsh, realism which makes it a highly appealing experience for any moviegoer. Everything in this film was great - from the brilliant editing and cinematography to the general drive that is kept running by strong acting performances (many by children) and a fantastic narrative-style comprised of flashbacks into the life of our game show contestant, each of those which are cleverly intertwined into the ostensibly random questions presented on the game show. And that is what made this film, for me, so memorable. All of those small, seemingly trivial, details in scenes had this kind of inherent importance associated with it. The story necessitated that each detail be recalled and, in doing so, ensured that each detail have significance.Nominated for 10 Academy Awards in 2009 and winning 8 of them (including Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay), this film was both a commercial and critical success. Slumdog Millionaire presents us with an exhilarating, descriptive story that dissects the origins of our protagonist and his time growing up in the impoverished streets of Mumbai. The energy in this film and realism of the slums is almost akin to that of 'City of God' and the game show premise ensures a full throttle, electrifying pace. Seamlessly mixing intense drama and uplifting action, Slumdog Millionaire, along with its emotionally- charged momentum, is an absolute treat.",9,2,3,16 July 2016
