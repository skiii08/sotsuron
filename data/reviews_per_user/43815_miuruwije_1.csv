The Expendables 2," Great for an action movie buff
","One word-Amazing,this was only the word coming out of my mouth while watching this flick. Reading reviews of poor story-line and weak acting had me discouraged to enjoy this amazing movie but once you start watching this movie none of those things come to mind.The movie starts involving an infiltration into the jungles of Albania to rescue a secret something (a MacGuffin) from a downed airplane. Things don't go as expected. Ross and his team lose not only the MacGuffin but also one of their own. Tearfully, they vow revenge. The team tracks the bad guys in Russia, where apparently a lot of uranium exists. The bad guys, led by Van Damme, plan to get all of the unguarded uranium and either hold the world hostage or destroy it. This movie is'n't for the critical thinkers or science graduates but for those who like to have a good time. So just go watch this movie!",9,1,3,31 August 2012
