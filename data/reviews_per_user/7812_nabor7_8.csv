Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," A Total Waste of time
","I am glad I waited for this to come out on DVD. It appears to be only a typical money making movie based on toilet humor and racism. If one tries to draw a socially relevant conclusion of the various points this movie attempted to make, they are deluded. This is nothing more than cheap, vulgar humor made at the expense of others and seem to be made OK by Borat's naiveté'. Sorry it just doesn't wash. I will admit I laughed a little, but overall this was a very feeble attempt at some misguided and unforeseen point. It's sad that Hollywood has resorted to films with no substance and character development. Instead, we are subjected to mindless plots, poor acting, and high ticket prices.",1,5,10,30 July 2007
The Day After Tomorrow," A Tiring, and Clichéd Propaganda Movie
","I finally made myself watch this and I wasn't disappointed. I liked the special effects and the cast but that was about it. The storyline was so full of holes that it was evident that this was a Hollywood election year statement rather than a movie offering. The uncanny resemblance of the President to Al Gore, and the Vice-President to Harry Truman had to be part of the mix, along with the diatribe on the Kyoto Treaty. This was a movie designed to attract the extreme environmentalists while providing a token of an action/drama movie for the rest of us. It's no wonder Box Office sales are down when Hollywood has resigned itself to movies such as this and poorly done remakes of earlier movies and TV shows.",1,12,26,20 March 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," A Fitting End to a Great Trilogy
","I have watched all three repeatedly and have enjoyed every minute. These are pure entertainment and looking for a developing love stories or serious plot lines will surely lead to disappointment. I looked for nothing except to be entertained and it delivered. I enjoyed the numerous plots with the constant betrayals, and the characters maintained their basic flaws and attributes developed through out the three movies. In the end we see each characters true traits. That is about as deep as anyone needs to go. I really enjoyed the one line comments and facial expression especially by Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush. For pure entertainment pop some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy every minute.",8,0,2,28 November 2008
Gettysburg," Very moving movie
","While working in the Gettysburg area for a short time. I rented the movie, went to the battlefield and then re-watched the movie. There are some historical inaccuracies, as can be expected, but as one who looks for realism, I found it in Gettysburg. There was quite of bit of the actual battle that was omitted, but the interaction of the characters and their perplexing situations presented to us, more than made up for it. It would be hard for any reasonable thinking person to imagine what it was like for life long friends like Reynolds, Hancock, and Armistead to find themselves facing each other in war as enemies. I thought the movie developed the characters brilliantly. Reynolds was the consummate soldier. Hancock was also brilliant soldier, but also had compassion towards his rebel friend. Armistead was a soldier but cherished the friends he had served with before.The casting was amazing as I watched the credits and saw how similar the actors selected resembled their roles. In a movie like Gettysburg, one has to look past the superficial and look at the time in history and how the military conducted itself. The point being made to Chamberlain about the 20th Maine was the end of the Union line. They were the extreme flank. Up until this battle, the Union army had been beaten and if Lee had prevailed, that would have in all likelihood been the final victory the south needed for the north to sue for peace.Looking at Gettysburg as a must win situation for the north places make the character interaction and the discussions between the various commanders all the more compelling. They understood the gravity of what could be won or lost. This movie is a must-see to show what a dark time in history and in personal lives it was.",Null,1,1,18 October 2004
Disturbia," Good Thriller
","A lot of people have compared this to a poor version of Rear Window. I fail to see the comparison. The premise of being confined to his house and ultimately spying on his neighbors is as far as it goes. Notwithstanding his fathers death, his house arrest was the culmination of the run in with his Spanish teacher and from previous troubles. The stage is set as a typical restless teen who one by one has his sources of entertainment either cancelled or has his access blocked, turning to anything that can put off the boredom. I thought the scenes of his transformation from a rebel to being resigned to his fate were realistic. I watched it twice in one weekend and likened the characters to myself and my best friend when I was a teen. It's like the boy who cried wolf once too often. When you're that age you aren't taken seriously, especially if you have been prone to trouble, so you take matters into your own hands not thinking of the consequences. I thought the cast was superb, with David Morse turning in his usual excellent work. Carrie-Anne Moss played the part of a mother who has to balance earning a living and concern over her son and his problems perfectly. This is an excellent movie with no strings attached.",8,1,2,13 August 2007
Patton," The Classic War Movie
","Not much can be said of this movie that already hasn't been said. It captures the war, the man, and the conflict of the two. I thought the movie was very nicely tied together and I thought the reflections of Patton on the past was very necessary. Patton believed in reincarnation so in looking back at historical battles you can see how Patton developed his strategy. He was a student of great leaders and commanders and the movie developed that thought really well. The movie presented the characters, the actual war history, and the Germans extremely well and it is no wonder this movie received the awards it did. After watching this movie over and over again, I'm convinced that no one could have played Patton any better than George C. Scott. You can tell from the movie that he put everything he had into the character. My father-in-law was an officer under Patton in the 3rd. Army and has said over and again how realistic the movie is. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for an excellent re-telling of WWII history.",10,84,96,24 June 2004
Transformers," Very Disappointed
","My kids grew up watching Transformers on TV and took their kids to see it. I waited and saw it on video because I couldn't believe a movie such as this would be treated the way it was. I have about given up on movies because the good ones are few and far between. The so-called stars of today are for the most part self-centered and non-talented. My real complaint with Transformers is the dialogue concerning masturbation. Why in the world was that in there? Is Hollywood attempting to debase the rest of the country so that we will be as immoral as it is? Along the same lines, why do movies designed for kids have to contain at least one fart scene? (Shrek, etc.) What does it add? The visual effects of Transformers were expertly done, and it had the potential to be a really good movie, but the script put it in the gutter. Sorry, but it's not worth the trouble.",3,5,13,12 November 2007
The Bourne Supremacy," Excellent - As good, if not better than the original
","I watched this back to back and enjoyed every minute of it. The hand-held cameras were annoying and distracting and took away the feeling of being caught up in the action. They were intended to give that feeling, but the overuse has the opposite effect. When the action is that fast a hand-held doesn't give us more of the chaotic action of a fight, it only brings chaos, and is something Hollywood should consider. I was surprised to see Marie killed at the beginning, but it reminds us of the stark brutality of Bourne's job. In the first movie we saw a Bourne that was uneasy around women. He worked as a loner and probably would have been uneasy with anyone who could compromise his situation. In the second, with Marie dead we get a chance to see the real Bourne, alone, the way he really was. With the Tredstone project dead I liked the interaction with the Neski daughter. I thoroughly enjoyed both movies and this is a rare treat when the sequel ids as good if not better than the original",10,3,4,31 January 2005
