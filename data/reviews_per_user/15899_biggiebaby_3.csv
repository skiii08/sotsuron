First Man," Like watching a metronome.
","Gosling at his one dimensional best. Cluncky and disjointed, the story rides along like a low budget wannabe art film, but, with high budget actors. No character development to speak of just long lonesome staring off to the right of the camera lens. With the possible exception of the ubiquitous wife/mother scene demanding emotions from the husband/father. 
First Man Joins the ranks of movies you'll watch once and never again.",4,178,305,17 October 2018
Midway," Painful to watch.
","I forced myself to watch this to the end. Now, I know what to expect with a Emmerich movie. But, damn.
Insipid unrealistic dialog. Horrible character development, I was rooting for the Japanese to kill that douchebag pilot, and that reminds me... the stupid stereotypical accents...
The blocking, who was the cinematographer on this pos? It just felt unnatural the whole time.
And the cgi....
Just a bloated poorly made mess.
The 76 version is vastly superior.",2,0,0,4 July 2020
Annihilation," Typically lazy
","Meh, it had a appearance, well produced all that good stuff, but, was so very typical. ' Lets do some cool cgi then go sit on our asses'.
This movie was much better when it was called 'Search for Spock' .
It has a premise and thats it. WTF is it? Planet cancer? Terraforming aliens? No clue....
Write a cohesive story next time guys.",5,2,6,17 July 2019
