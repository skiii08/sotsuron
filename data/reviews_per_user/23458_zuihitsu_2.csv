Walk the Line," uneventful & unoriginal love story, with some great acting
","I expected a lot more from this film. I have nothing against the great Mr. Cash (may he rest in piece), or the actors, but the director/screenwriter James Mangold should be whipped because of this. I mean, the movie was *empty*. All it was, was the same old love-story we've seen over and over and over again. The movie had next to nothing to do with Johnny Cash's music. Only part when it even talked about his music was when he was in the studio, recording for the first time. After that, nothing. It was all downhill from there. I continued to watch the movie to the finish, out of respect for the real person behind the story and the great actors, but it was definitely boring. There was *nothing* in the script we haven't seen a million times before. I'm sure Mr. Cash's real life was a lot more interesting, and their love story was a lot more fascinating and unique than this piece of crap screenplay was.Shame on you, Mr Mangold. Cashing in on a dead guy like that. Johnny would deserve better.",5,2,5,5 June 2006
Back to the Future Part III," Clara on tombstone
","It says in the Goofs that 'Factual errors: On Doc Brown's headstone, it says he was laid to rest by his beloved Clara on September 7th, 1885. But according to history, Clara was supposed to have died falling into the ravine (which would be named after her) days earlier, which also means she and Doc most likely would have never met.' I don't think this actually is a goof-up. The writers' would've spotted this one, it's too obvious.When Doc Brown first went back to 1885, he lived in Hill Valley for eight months before writing the letter to Marty. In this time he had made friends & enemies, as we all know. The mayor was one of these. Now, when Marty has arrived in 1885, the Mayor comes to visit Doc, and reminds him to about the arriving school teacher. Doc decides against meeting her.But, what happened in the history before Marty arrived there? Simple. Doc wasn't informed about falling in love with Clara, and went and met her. He (somehow) handled the horses, or took a different route, and they never crashed into the ravine. And what happened in the original history, the one where Doc never came to the Old West? No one went to meet Ms. Clara and she had to travel to town alone, and her horses were spooked by a snake.And now that Marty 'warned' Doc about him falling in love with Clara, Doc didn't go to meet her, like in the untouched history, and again her horses were spooked. It happened differently, but again Doc was there to save her (even though we never saw the first rescue, nor did Doc & Clara even necessarily realize what might've happened).Aargh, this is much easier to think through, than to write down. =)",9,0,0,31 August 2006
