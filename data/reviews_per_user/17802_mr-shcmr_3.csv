Your Name.," Love Story - Romance + Clichés
","THIS REVIEW IS ABOUT THE STORY. EVERYTHING ELSE (ART, SECONDARY CHARACTERS, ATMOSPHERE) IS GREAT.A boy and a girl discover that some days, their lives are swapped, which they only remember as dreams afterwards.You see the love story coming between those two ? Color me naive, but I didn't.First, it's one of the most contrived premises you could have for a love story. Second, there's like a million stories you could tell with such a premise, why take the less original ? Of all the funny, awkward, insightful etc. things that could happen to two people who exchange lives, why go for the most clichéd ?But OK, let's accept that they fall in love with each other. After all, a lot of the emotional impact of the second half of the movie hinges on their being infatuated with each other. But we're never shown that happen ! The most we're shown for Mitsuha (the girl) is that she takes an interest in Taki's (the boy) life. I guess it could count as both reason and show of her growing fondness for him. As limited as it is, at least it's a small hint that something's happening.We're not so lucky with Taki.After his date with his female coworker, she guesses that he's recently fallen for another woman. At that point I thought she guessed wrong, because nothing we see supports that idea. But I'm more and more convinced that she's conveying the message of the authors : at that moment, they're flatly informing us that Taki is falling for Mitsuha.What do they say again in storytelling school ? 'Show, don't tell.' Well, it's a typical example of telling, not showing.It's like the movie is trolling us : 'Oh, btw, Taki's totally into Mitsuha now ! A lot of stuff happened, but we didn't think it was worth showing, even though ALL we're showing you are those 2 very characters. U mad ?'Just to be clear, I'm not saying that he has no reason for falling in love. He has plenty ! If you've seen the movie, here's a quick quiz. Taki falls in love with Mitsuha because :a) he's attracted by her looksb) he's impressed by her skillsc) he's thankful for her helpd) he remembers their first encounter in the subwaye) they're soulmatesf) any of the other bazillion possible reasons ?You don't know ? Nobody does ! Because we don't see their love bloom.As it is, this love story misses its core, its pivotal moment. It's a love story without romance.Little annoyances :Memories and messages appear and disappear so as to fit the plot's needs so perfectly that we have left the lands of Plot Convenience to enter the realm of Plot Laziness.The second part is so clichéd that at any point you can safely guess what happens in the next 15 minutes.Mitsuha convinces her father at the end in a deeply moving and insightful argument. Well, I guess, because we're TOLD, NOT SHOWN (uuuuugh)",4,49,96,1 March 2017
Arrival," Meditative alien encounter movie reminiscent of Contact.
","It seems that a lot of the complaints come from people who expected an action movie. But not every alien movie has to be that ! So if you like the other kind, slow paced, low-key, intellectual... then go watch Contact.Arrival draws a lot from Contact : themes, pace, plot elements. Both are stories where the big alien encounter mostly serves as a device to explore the psyche and emotions of a single human : the female lead role.At times, Contact managed to make you ponder about science and faith. In the end, Arrival, with more sets and more CGI, and a gripping dark atmosphere, will mostly make you think about its plot holes and shortcuts.",4,4,9,30 January 2017
The Pursuit of Happyness," This movie froze my blood
","The pursuit of Happiness is a 2006 horror movie with Will Smith as the lead role. Don't be fooled by the happy end, horror movies can have happy ends too, and if you're a young person studying or looking for a job like I was when I first saw it, don't watch it unless you're ready for nights of cold sweat.There's a scene (typical of this movie) where Will Smith barely manages to catch the attention of a businessman by solving a Rubik's Cube in the span of a short taxi ride. It's clear that the intent of the scene is to lift you up (look ! he managed to get an interview ! you can do it too !), but that very scene gave me nightmares : what if I'm not good at Rubik's Cube ? Nobody told me I had to be good at Rubik's Cube to get a good job ! It is a thing now ? Shouldn't it be taught at school then ? And what if I learn Rubik's Cube and the guy does Hanoi Tower ?Another time Will arrives late and in dirty clothes at his interview (not by his fault), and saves it with a snappy reply. What if he didn't find that reply ? I'm shy : does that mean I have to settle for shitty jobs ? Is there no salvation for people who are in any way short of perfection ?'Cause there is no nuance in this movie, no shades of grey : it's either thrive like the best, or die like the rest. Never Will rebels or even questions the situation he's in.But don't worry : at the end of his kafkaesque ride, Will will manage to land the job of his dreams, in the lofty world of rich people, high above the mass of the rest of zombies crawling under the surface in cramped subways. What about you and me ? We're doomed, my friend. DOOMED.",1,3,7,23 February 2017
