3:10 to Yuma," Reconstructing the Western For a Doubtful Future
","I was 12 when I first saw 3:10 to Yuma with Van Heflin and Glen Ford. Two years later, something of a remake appeared. Kirk Douglas was trying to get a somewhat companionable Anthony Quinn to jail in Last Train to Gun Hill.The star vehicle state of modern Hollywood films is now making it more difficult to remake these western morality tales.Christian Bale, a desperate rancher on the verge of bankruptcy and facing foreclosure of his mortgage is supposedly the lead in the new 3:10, but Russell Crowe playing the outlaw Ben Wade is the real lead. Fifty years ago, Van Hefflin played the Nester making some money on the side to take Glen Ford to jail at Yuma prison.Looked at closely, both 3:10s and Last Train are buddy westerns. The films are about a pair of hard men gradually warming up to one another, becoming friends. But there's a lot more company on the stagecoach to Contention to catch the train this time.There's Christian Bale as the failed farmer Dan Evans looking for some quick money for delivering Wade. His son William complicates things by following Wade and his father without the old man's permission. Also along for the ride is a grizzled, gray and wrinkled Peter Fonda, as a Pinkerton Security Man who has been a mercenary in many a Pinkerton black bag job.Fonda is gut shot early on in the game, during an elaborate stage robbery, in which the Pinkertons have equipped the stagecoach with armor, a Gatling gun, and Pinkerton men to guard the payroll. Normally being gut shot in a Western means certain death. But the law of the Western has been abrogated here so Fonda can get something more than a cameo in the film. A Veterinarian in nearby Bigsby removes the bullet so Fonda can stay on. Later though, Fonda becomes disposable. Wade, responding to Fonda's goading, gets an opportunity to rough Fonda up some, then casually throw him off a convenient cliff to his death.That's another problem here. Since Russel Crowe is the lead, he gets special privileges in his role as an outlaw. He makes sketches of benign birds, betrays knowledge of books he's read, chides the Pinkertons about their lack of education and a philosophy. This leader of an outlaw band is a renaissance man. Worse, when Bale runs into trouble evading Wade's gang, which is trying to spring their boss, Wade sometimes changes horses midstream and helps him. This happens so often, the audience is in doubt about just who is going to be the hero of this horse opera, Evans or Wade. Who's going to leave the larger mark on impressionable William Evans, Ben Wade or Will's father Dan?All through the film, the dwindling group delivering Wade to the Train, is dogged by Wade's gang. But good guy opportunities are missed. The marshal of Contention has enough firepower in the hotel room to simply scatter gun all seven of Wade's men on the street below. But the gang starts offering money to all the murderers and scalawags in town to help recover their boss, Hearing this, the Marshal and his deputies throw in the towel, put down their weapons and are wiped out to the man, by Wade's gang, when they step outside.After this, Dan Evans and the last Pinkerton are having their own doubts. But Evans sticks it out and agrees to deliver Wade to the train. All along the trail, Evans and Wade have been trading bits of their pasts to one another, warming up in their respect for one another and warming up audience respect too. Now they've made it to the train station. Lead is flying everywhere and both are revealing secrets. Evans dumps the last chapter of his biography on Wade, who admits that he's been to Yuma twice before and escaped both times. This leaves a relieved Evans off the hook for Wade's proposed hanging at Yuma.Wade is enthused about his new pal too. So enthused that he resolves to help deliver himself to the train. Just then Wade's second in command Charlie Prince (Ben Foster) arrives and pumps five bullets into Evans, meaning its more than a flesh wound this time: its certain death. Wade amazes the audience after being handed his gun and holster, by promptly shooting all five of his remaining associates to death in an elaborate bit of gun play, in anger for the wanton killing of his new friend, even though Dan isn't quite dead yet. Wade's son Will watches his father slowly die, then turns his colt on Wade, who has one in his own hand. But Ben turns his pistol over to the lad with some consoling words, then hops cheerfully aboard the train to Yuma.My own thinking is that the Western died in the Sixties when Americans realized they had no more frontiers in the face of the endless Cold War and the failure of the war in Vietnam. The appearance of two westerns in a single weekend- the other one is Shoot 'Em Up With Clive Owen and Paul Giamati- causes one to reflect that Americans may be rethinking their destinies. Maybe we can conduct a war while spending what we want at the mall, enduring a sub prime lending crisis, with Wall Street demanding lower interest rates to lift the Stock Market. We can do it, that is, while undercutting the moral firepower of our new Westerns. We're not likely to win many wars this way either.",7,2,6,10 September 2007
Fight Club," Raging Bull**** from Ed Norton and Brad Pitt!
","When Susan Faluhdi wrote a piece saluting this film, but really promoting her own book Stiffed, I decided I'd better have a look.  We're nearing the end of the Century and the Millenium and the jig is up in nearly every direction.  The Cold War is over. The major political fights in America are over lifestyle issues.  The folks producing films are forced to use vaguely focused Arab terrorists as villians, because the traditional communists are our friends, sort of.  And Feminists are writing books in defense of abused MEN.Its the perfect backdrop for a story about young guys so fed up with the ennui of these times, their only relief comes from knocking one another senseless.  First its the two friends, Brad Pitt and Ed Norton who knock one another about while living in a broken down abandoned building.  But in the words of an old Chrysler commercial, it starts a movement, a momentum a beat.  And the Beat Goes On with fight clubs forming all over America.You would think Pitt would be the lead here, but its Ed Norton handling the narrative, the voice-over.  Ed goes thru the usual contortions.  Bored in the meaningless job he holds in the corporate world, Norton quits and takes up an equally meaningless unemployed existence with Pitt. Why work for the soulless corporate machine when you can appear just as prosperous with no job at all.Lingering in the background is a decidedly un-English-looking Helen Bonham Carter.  Helen hasn't a lot to do but smoke cigs and look downmarket and fetching.  The storytellers are holding her out here in hopes that either Norton or Pitt will make a move on her.  For Pitt, that is out of the question. Norton walks her home a couple of times. But Helen doesn'treally get a lot of action in this movie.  So much for the love interest.The movie is a guy thing you see.  I can barely remember what the climactic scene at the end is about.  Its just a lot of cosmic acting out; Jimmy Carter's Malaise. Its supposed to mean something, but it doesn't have to really, since its producing the requisite violence for a $75 million domestic gross. The violence is meaningless but necessary to stir interest among the 18-34 year old demographic this film is aimed at. Go see the Brad Pitt movie about Tibet, or catch Ed singing in that Woody Allan film of a few years ago.  The Fight Club should have been aborted at birth.",Null,1,3,4 November 1999
Lords of Dogtown," Capturing Skateboarding and the Seventies with Heath Ledger and His Merry Men
","Lords is a high energy film that drags the audience speeding along with it, tracing the early history of skateboarding in Venice, California.We follow the fortunes of four roughly 15 to 17 year old boys and some of their girlfriends along with an alcoholic skateboard entrepreneur named Skip.The Lords start their day by boarding off the roofs of the run-down rentals of their parents, in Venice. They hook a ride on a city transit bus until the driver spots them in the rear view and starts fish-tailing to shake them off.Which turns out to be no problem. Our heroes drop off the bus jag, and segue into a line of stalled traffic, weaving in and out of the car line-up at high speed, by turns, dazzling and angering assorted drivers. Later, the most daring of the Four performs the crazy trick of boarding right thru a red light at a dangerous intersection without being hit.Skip badgers and cajoles the kids constantly. He exploits them to promote the skateboards he is manufacturing at his Zephyr surfing gear and skateboard store. We are at the dawn of the Skateboard craze and Skip is bent on becoming a millionaire early. Only, he drinks quite a bit and shows signs of being a burnt-out 35 year old hippie.That is the MO of one of the kid's Moms too, played by Rebecca De Mornay, who is so gone she uses expressions like 'far out' and 'man' and 'can you dig it?' Even her kids treat her like a whacked out hippie. There is a heavy subtext of abused kids with parents who've failed to grow up.At one point, De Mornay's current 'old man' is moving out, and asks her reluctant son to help him, cautioning him to put a blanket over an enormous clear garbage bag of marijuana before carrying it to his car, and offering his surf board as a guilty pay-off for abandoning him, a scene both appalling and amusing to the audience.Skip keeps running his hand-to-mouth manufacturing enterprise, employing other whacked hippies like himself, only working when they need enough jack to make a connection. Its hard to keep a production schedule when your 'groovy' friends refuse to show up for work. I've just realized, looking at the cast on IMDb, that the cool but whacked Skip is Australian Heartthrob Heath Ledger. This part is so good and Ledger so good in it, he deserves an Oscar. I didn't recognize him in his granny seventies blonde long hair. Its his best work on screen.The Lords are perplexed and demoralized by the growing showbiz that is starting to overtake boarding. They gradually have given up on Skip, and begun to quarrel. But before falling completely apart, they define a new stunt that quickly makes them the crowned heads of sidewalk surfing.Los Angeles Area pool-owners are ordered to drain their pools. The Lords decide to practice new stunts in empty pools, stealing into backyards the instant the owners go to work. The audience watches as the surfers perform outrageous tricks in the pools. An article appears in Skateboarding, another in People. Suddenly our boys are stars!Only not all of them like it. An evil presence has intruded into their idyllic childhoods. One of the Lords steals a girl from a more waspish Lord, who looks like he is one of the Hansens singing group. There's a lot of long blond summer surfing hair on these guys. Only one of them has dark hair. One Lord refuses to accept any of the offers. He turns skinhead and starts hanging out with a gang. The Waspish one gets an endorsement deal and starts touring for a board company. Another of the Lords wants all the marbles, and signs with a Hollywood type who travels with an entourage of hangers-on and cheap bimbos in a longish limousine.The hapless Skip has lost his guys and his business. We see him hand crafting a surfboard in the back of someone Else's surfing store. A clerk from the retail side comes in and asks if he'll have a customer's board ready by the next day. Skip says yeah, sure. When they leave, Skip relaxes, lights a cig, reaches for his hidden bottle, turns on the radio, acts out a lip-synched Maggie Mae that would put Rod Stewart out of business, then quietly returns to work. The whole 45 second turn is the best thing in the movie.The wonderful ease of the Lords and the culture they created is spoiled by Success. The Lords stop seeing one another until the dark-haired kid develops a brain tumor and the others, finding success is not what its cracked up to be, gather at his father's dry pool for a rendezvous. An American Graffitti-style Epilogue tells us who the Lords become when they finally grow up.When the lights go up I'm surprised to find two pairs of girls the only audience viewing the film with me. Voila!, why didn't I see it? This is a chick flick, even a skin movie for girls, since there is quite a bit of bared male surface in it. In the lobby, I notice two of the girls are dressed totally in black, wearing the wool knit hats cool black guys now affect year around, and sporting chains that run from the belt loops of black pants to enormous truckers wallets in their back pockets. Lords reminds me a little of the stylish Fast and the Furious of a few years ago, but its ten times better. I'm still trying to figure out those two girls.",Null,1,12,9 June 2005
Match Point," Woody's Trying to Change His Career
","The best thing Woody Allen has done here is remove himself from the movie. It dawns that Allen has been boring us for years with plots featuring himself in the lead role, a move that eventually made all his films appear very much alike. The plot of Match Point is similar to Dreiser's American Tragedy which was made by George Stevens in 1949 as A Place in the Sun with Monty Clift and Liz Taylor. In this one tennis pro and former tennis tourney participant Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys Meyers) meets a tennis student who is the son of a rich family from the financial community in London. Meyers marries their daughter Chloe (Emily Mortimer) but before this is smitten by the blond American actress Nola Rice (Scarlett Johannson) who is engaged to be married to his student. Chris begins quietly hitting on her. Later, the Missus of the family manages to torpedo the engagement. Chris steps up his seduction of Nola. Later, Chloe is having trouble getting pregnant. At some point Nola gets pregnant and, believing Chris will leave his wife for her, refuses to have an abortion, sending Wilton into paroxysms of fear that he will be found out and lose Chloe and his lucrative position in the family. Chris decides to murder Nola with one of the family's shooting party shotguns at her apartment. To mask the motive, he kills the nice old lady next door and steals her jewels, then kills Nola Rice as she steps from the elevator. He returns the shotgun to its berth at the Mansion, and throws all the booty from the 'robbery' in the Thames. Except that one gold ring doesn't quite get over the railing, and lands instead in front of the railing overlooking the river. Scotland Yard questions Chris and discovers his romance by reading Nola's diary. Chris urges them not to ruin his marriage by telling his wife and her family. They agree not to. But the lead detective wakes in the night to a eureka moment. He deduces the woman next door was killed by Chris to camouflage the murder of Nola. Discussing the case the next day at work with a colleague, he learns that another burglary in the neighborhood overnight has resulted in the capture of the real murderer, who had the effrontery to be carrying the golden ring stolen in the original Burglary-murders. Yes, its the ring that didn't quite clear the railing. Chris Wilton, in other words, has gotten away with murder, just as Allen did in Crimes and Misdemeanors in 1989.The movie isn't great, but its better than the normal Woody film. I detected some choppiness in Johannsen's performance. When first meeting Chris she is terribly seductive and her acting superb. But later, as she falls in love, her portrayal of Nola becomes routine and banal. This doesn't quite make sense and undermines a romance that should have been taken down by the declining credibility of her lover. Instead, she becomes ordinary for no discernible reason except that Allan can't emphasize the romance and Chris's declining credibility as a committed lover at the same time. He has to furiously shovel plot at the audience instead.The movie isn't quite good. I sense it is an attempt by Allan to both resurrect the career that was nearly ruined by his marrying his own step daughter, and to move beyond his comic films to something that is not in his hero Ingmar Bergman's league, but may reach the level of Alfred Hitchcock, whose films are imitated somewhat here. I think the film borrows an unexplored part of the Farley Granger character in Stranger on a Train. I will bet we see more attempts at Hitchcock from Allen, who probably got the idea from David Lynch's paean to Hitch, Mullholland Drive.",6,1,2,27 February 2006
28 Weeks Later," Iraq War Politics and Family Values Mix Easily With Bloodstruck Zombies
","28 Days Later is one of the better, more serious horror films ever made.But since its premiere, lesser zombie films have rushed to trade on the Zombie film's reputation. First there is Shaun of the Dead, a Brit kitchen sink comedy that shows us the lighter side of zombies and even how to deal with them if one ever encounters a real one.Fox and the Brits are back with 28 WEEKS Later, a decidedly weaker effort than Days, with Iraq War failures intermixed with dabs of Family Values. The movie is bad but the politics are the cheekiest since the Full Monty.What remained of Brit forces, wiped up the carnage of 28 Days Later. But this bigger production demands a mightier crew: Yes, I'm afraid they've brought in the Americans. The US Army with all of its smugness intact is ready to screw it up and make a mess. This way, see, we don't just have just a zombie movie here but a metaphor for the joint British-American Failures in Iraq.Lets not forget family values. Robert Carlyle seems a bad choice for the father of two little girls. After all, Carlyle abandoned Frank and Malachy McCourt., left them to fend for themselves in Limerick Ireland. Carlyle wandered off to England for good when wife Angela and the family became a burden in Angela's Ashes. Also, he didn't provide the greatest fatherly example when stripped to the essential Full Monty in the movie by that name.Six months after the quelling of the Zombie invasion, civilians return to the boroughs of London to find US Army helicopters circling over Big Ben and the Thames, and US Army sharpshooters on the roofs watching for re-emerging zombies to return for another blood feast.Despite the American presence, the yanks in the cast don't seem genuine. Seasoned Americans- I'm one of those- can spot this instantly. Brit actors can fake the accent and the look the ticket in some varieties of American movies, particularly when there are other Americans in the cast. But these 'Americans' have to be modeled after signature American types. These GIS ARE Americans though. They just seem a lot like Brits. Without the f*ck*n' adjective in every three word sentence and the US uniforms, you wouldn't know they were yanks at all.The problem is really that Brit filmmakers don't know that in a movie like this you make use of stock American types. They've got one guy, the Black US army general who is modeled on the authoritative figure, often cast as a cop, that Ernie Hudson plays in stateside movies. Hudson is macho. He's got all the cool left over from Richard Roundtree's portrayal of John Shaft in 1971 and some menace besides. This guy playing the general in command of US Forces in London is decidedly weak tea by comparison.Carlyle's kids are angry at him for telling them their mother is dead, but tries to con them instead, saying he only said that the Zombie kissed their mom. When the mom turns up alive, apparently untouched by the zombie contagion, a combination of full-fledged AIDS with Rabies combined, a nurse decides that she and her daughters must be preserved at all costs. Their blood could be the source of a protective serum against the Virus.The efforts to isolate and quarantine any stray zombie still operating go awry when Carlyle, overwhelmed by guilt for fibbing to his kids, tries to at least straighten it out with the suddenly alive missus. But she really did get kissed by a zombie, and for Carlyle, that's the rub. In the time it takes to passionately kiss his wife, Carlyle is transformed into the most rabid of zombies. He cuts himself a swath of victims-cum-zombies just in the hospital alone, that reignites the crisis of six months ago. Suddenly, the smug Americans on rooftops have to break away from the peeping tom role they've been playing with rifle telescopes and do some serious shooting. But like the Iraq venture, the sharpshooting soon runs amok. A rooftop shooter named Doyle stops shooting, realizing the sharpshooters are now killing innocent citizens, unable to separate zombies from human beings.Doyle teams up with Carlyle's two daughters who are now fleeing poison gas attacks and rockets from those American helicopters overhead, along with sniper fire from his brethren still atop the city's major buildings. One sniper pumps a bullet into the statue of Lord Wellington in Trafalgar Square as Big Ben strikes the hour. Its all low comedy to make sport of the American GI ignorance of British tradition and landmarks. Doyle is killed but the two daughters escape to a Soccer stadium where Doyle's friend, a black helicopter pilot, brings them aboard and the craft wends its way out to sea over the White Cliffs of Dover. I can faintly hear the strains of Vera Lynn singing When the Lights Go On Again, as the Yanks, aided by the pluckier Brits, mount a quick counterattack and end the film.28 weeks later isn't a great film, but its a sly dig at the Bush Administration and the Poodle Acquiescense of Tony Blair.",Null,0,1,21 May 2007
21," 21 A Bad Shuffle of a Superb Nonfiction Classic
","21 is a poor version of Ben Mezrich's best-selling 2002 Bringing Down the House. The original story is about five Asian MIT students who walked off with $3 million card counting at various casinos around the country, beginning in the early nineties.The movie makers have constructed a half-baked love story that isn't actually in the book. With the romantic intrusion, the thriller aspect of the original is lost. The book may have been tricked up a little. But 21, the movie seems bent on helping casino security Bull Laurence Fishburne keep his image intact and that of the Vegas casinos unblemished. Because the characters appear to be playing in real Las Vegas casinos, at least at times, it looks as if producers may have cut a deal with Vegas to soften both Fishburne's tough guy image and minimize embarrassment the Casinos suffered at the hands of the merry MIT crew.In the book, the casinos and their pit bosses and security people were clods who never caught onto a thing for over six years. The movie hasn't got time for that long a wait. Fishburne is suspicious of lead Ben Campbell almost instantly.Here's a major myth that grew up in the seventies that the book explodes: Casinos spread the story that once multi-decks were placed in shoes, card counting wouldn't work anymore. In fact, multi-decks actually improved odds for counting players by lengthening the period of time that dealer's hands stayed hot for players and cold for dealers.In the film the MIT crew does all its work in Vegas. In the book, the MIT gang went to riverboats around Chicago, to Louisiana and Missisippi Indian casinos and even overseas to Monte Carlo and Cannes.In the film, Kevin Spacey is an MIT math prof who spearheads the Casino Con and enlists his own students to be his players. A college girl is in love with the hero Ben Campbell. In reality, all of the players were Asians who wore disguises and masqueraded as rich orientals out to blow big money at the tables. Mickey(Spacey), the crew leader and organizer is an MIT prof and a professional gambler too.The movie constructs a fiction that Campbell only wants to make $300,000 to finance his education at Harvard as a doctor. The truth is the real Jeff Ma never went to Med School and never wanted to. Ma and the four orientals who took down Vegas, worked the various casinos for nearly ten years and only gave it up when most casinos in the country had identified them and they could no longer play.Somewhere in the middle of the book Mickey and the Ben Campbell character modeled on Jeff Ma split, and begin running separate teams in the casinos. The movie has Mickey (Spacey) fingering Ben and his team to Casino Security. That would have exposed Mickey too. Its absurd. In fact, though there was some minor bad blood after the split, it was in the interests of both teams to keep quiet about one another. And that is what they did.In the book, the players wore disguises always and changed them often so they wouldn't be recognized when they returned to the same casinos. The movie talked of disguises but Ben never actually wore won except once. It made no sense. He'd have been caught on the second visit without a disguise. In the film, one of the hand signals to tip the Ben to the 'hot' blackjack table, was so blatantly obvious, no pit manager or security bull could have missed it.The movie left two nerdy friends of Ben Campbell's lurking around MIT clueless about Ben's weekend table action. Those characters and the plots around them were lame. The whole college crosscut was so weak they might just as well have eliminated it altogether. Trying to merge the college weekdays and weekend gambling simply didn't play. Campbell (Jim Sturges) was supposed to have been half-enticed into the ring by his yen for fellow student Jill Taylor (Kate Bosworth). But the romance seemed half-hearted once underway. The book knew better. The deceptions and nearly being caught by security time after time took up all the action and made the book a unique thriller. Movie makers constructed a supposed collusion between Campbell and Security Bull Fishburne to get even with Mickey. The tacked on ending was so absurd anyone could see through it. In fact, Jeff Ma is not a WASP like the one Campbell portrayed, but an oriental. The four fellow Oriental MIT students worked the casinos for nearly ten years and were well into their thirties before they quit. Only near the end of that time were they thoroughly caught, identified and forced to stop. I'm not sure any of them ever graduated from MIT. Ma didn't.Spacey and Fishburne give routine performances as if they couldn't take the film seriously. I wonder why? In the washroom afterward I told two twenty somethings what a pack of lies the film was and gave them the book title so they could read the true story. 21 could have been a remarkable film in the hands of a writer-director like Dave Mamet. The film was market designed as a cross between Wedding Crashers and a bad Adam Sandler movie. A few of the six college students behind me kept mistaking ordinary lines as American Pie easy laughs, but the rest of the audience stayed silent.The Filmmakers, who are not worth mentioning, destroyed a perfectly wonderful story that could have been a great movie. They doubled down in duplicity.",Null,1,1,6 August 2008
No Country for Old Men," No Movie For the Squeamish: Coens Return to Their Blood Simple Roots
","The Coens are back and at their primitive best. They've taken Cormac McCarthy's novel and changed it into a novel of details like the novels of Jim Thompson. Most of the film is without dialog. Characters don't get to talk much. They act, think, strategize, hide, enter and leave a dizzying array of motels and hotels and then leave them. There are more doors opened and closed in this slow character study than any film since Mr. Blanding Built His Dream House.Josh Brolin is a new fixture in films to me. He reminds me of a younger, grittier Harrsion Ford. I first saw him in the one of the Tarantino-Rodriquez Grindhouse double feature B films in the spring playing a mad doctor. I think he may have played another role in the other film. Then he was even better in American Gangster as a wonderfully corrupt detective. In No Country, he surpasses himself. If he didn't have to share billing with Javier Bardem and Tommy Lee Jones,he'd be up for best actor honors this Awards Season.Tommy Lee Jones seems almost to be repeating himself in Missing and the Three Burials of Elquiedas Estrada. In each succeeding film he wears less makeup, the face is more lined, the acne scars more visible. His character is more like a commentator than the cop catching the bad guys of audience expectations. He is more like the Walter Matthau sheriff after Kirk Douglas in the 1960 film Lonely Are The Brave. Matthau mostly comments on the out of place cowpoke making critical remarks to his deputy rather than seriously chasing Douglas into the Mountains. Jones embodies the idea of a present too violent for 60 year old peace officers like himself to referee and regulate. Tommy Lee has conversations with two old character actors, one, Barry Corbin, who appears to be a fatherfigure. Jones' father and grandfather were lawmen, neither lived past 40, but all of them were tougher birds than he. Instead of seriously confronting the malign Javier Bardem, Tommy Lee's character mainly just tries to think along with the serial killer and hit-man and with Josh Brolin. He's not thinking too well either. He certainly should have offered police protection to Brolin's wife on the two occasions when he interviewed her. The movie starts when Brolin, hunting antelope, wanders on the scene of a revenge shooting and massive drug buy, discovering five roll-barred trucks and dead men with Uzis and machine guns scattered all around. He finds bricks of cocaine among the strewn bodies, spent shells and weapons. There's a Mexican man still barely alive and wanting water, but Brolin has none. And in a valise, between $1 and $2 million in $100 dollar bills. Brolin takes off with the satchel, tells his wife nothing, then wakes up in the night feeling the need to get that still living Mexican the drink of water he craved, a fatal mistake for Brolin. Because it is when he returns to the scene that the panoply of bad guys led by malign monster Javier Bardem first get a line on him. If he hadn't returned he'd a gotten clean away. Hype about the film suggest the Bardem character is a monster. But I was not convinced by the film itself since I had seen him a few years back playing a fearful and fleeing Cuban homosexual. Bardem weighs a few more pounds for Old Men, but he didn't scare me any. I thought he was pretty predictable. The Audience was pulling for Brolin against Bardem the collector of the lost loot. The film never did show who gets the valise with the money in it though it seems likely Bardem did. Instead, three ironic scenes were shown as epilogue to the showdown over the money, the last featuring Tommy Lee talking to his wife about dreams he'd had the night before about his father and grandfather.The film ends without the kind of easy moral of most thrillers and westerns of which this is both. If you want to see the Coens as they were in the beginning, this is the film.",9,0,5,10 December 2007
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," A High Quality Dime Novel of a Movie
","After 15 years as outlaws, Frank and Jesse James were tired, beaten and worried about their futures. Without the experienced Younger Brothers, former Confederate guerrilla raiders, all captured in the Northfield, Minnesota bank robbery fiasco, the outlook for their outlaw future was bleak. Jesse grew suspicious of the uneducated stumble bum 20 year olds who helped on their last train robbery in Glendale, Missouri.The two hour and 40 minute movie is about Jesse and five of the young fellow robbers after the Glendale train holdup. It reminded me a little of a movie of the seventies called Bad Company, which featured a number of young 20 year old men footloose on the late nineteenth century prairie. Frank just walked away from it all, moving with his wife to Virginia, leaving Jesse surrounded by nimcimpoops. One of the young men, Wood Hite, used his position as Jesse's cousin to jockey for position among the other young criminals. Wood and Dick Liddil, another of the gang, visited Wood's father and the older man's young bride in Kentucky. Liddil was already romancing Wood's sister back at a prairie home hideout in Missouri. There was bad blood between the two men. When Liddil romanced the old man's young wife in the privy late the first night after the two of them got to Kentucky, it was the last straw. Liddil went back to Missouri and holed up in an old house on the prairie until Jesse rode in and asked him to ride with him to find another gang member. When they got to the man's house, Jesse started roughing up the subteen brother of Bob and Charley Ford. Liddil stopped him. After that Liddil went to the Missouri hideout run by Wood's sister where Bob and Charley Ford were living. Hite came up the stairs with his gun drawn, to kill Liddil, who jumped out the window. Bob Ford killed Wood with one shot. He and Liddil dumped the naked body in a nearby ravine, drawing a titter from the two 70 year old ladies sitting down in front of me in the audience. The news was kept from Jesse for fear he' d kill Liddil and the two Ford Brothers. Jesse was getting more nervous about his young associates. He went to visit another fellow outlaw, Ed Miller at his lonely farm house on the plain, invited him to go to town for dinner, then shot him in the back of the head. Bob had already been talking with the Governor of Missouri about killing Jesse for a pardon and the $10,000 reward. Brother Charley was reluctantly concluding too that Jesse, ostensibly planning a bank heist for the three of them, intended to kill he and Bob when it was over.Against this backdrop of suspicion, Jesse was telling the Ford Brothers he wanted them in on the holdup. Bob and Charley were running out of time. When Jesse got on a chair to adjust a picture, both Fords reached for their guns. Bob Ford just got his shot off first. Bob high-tailed it to the telegraph office and wired the Governor that he'd shot Jesse dead. The Fords were arrested, tried and convicted of the murder of Jesse. Just before the hanging the Governor of Missouri pardoned them and even gave them some of the $10,000 reward.For two and a half years Bob and Charley re-enacted the killing of Jesse on Broadway, Bob playing himself, and Charley playing Jesse. 800 performances in just under two years. Afterward, Charley, never much for the theater, shot hisself to death in 1884. Bob lit out for the territories, establishing gambling joints in the gold fields of Colorado, making alliances with corrupt lawmen and organized gamblers. After Jesse's death, Bob thought people would consider him a hero. They didn't. He visited the wives of many of the men Jesse had killed, expecting to be thanked. He wasn't. Gradually he realized his dime novel sense of things had been juvenile. He started to grow up some. But a disgruntled old man angry over Ford's traitorous murder of the sainted Jesse, shot Bob to death with a shotgun in the gambling tent Bob had erected temporarily in Creeg, Colorado.There was no dime novels for Bob Ford or Robin Hood legends neither.Frank James turned himself in personally to Governor Crittenden of Missouri not long after Jesse was killed. A deal had been cut to prevent his extradition to Northfield, Minnesota. Frank stood trial in Missouri and Alabama. Due to the Robin Hood legacy of the James Brothers, no jury would convict him. Frank took a job as a shoe salesman and later worked at a St. Louis theater which advertised 'come get your ticket punched by Frank James!' He worked as an AT&T Telegraph operator. In 1902, he and Cole Younger, now out of jail, took to the lecture circuit together. Frank lived until 1915, long enough that he could have been a technical adviser on a western film. However, they didn't make the first silent about Jesse and he until 1921.Though Brad Pitt plays Jesse and the much older Sam Shepherd plays Frank in this ensemble movie, the best performance among many very good ones, belongs to Casey Affleck, the second great performance I've seen from him in two weeks. The story is told in dialog much like that in the dime novels. People are perpetually puzzled, joking and weird like they appear in dime novels. The childishness of the younger gang members dominates the screenplay. This artsy film will probably be nominated for Oscars. Affleck will be nominated for a best supporting actor if he's not nominated best actor for Gone Baby Gone. The films 160 minutes glided by without notice because the film was continually interesting. It will certainly be nominated for best director and best picture.",8,0,1,30 October 2007
Remember the Titans," Just Remember the Title!
","Two coaches, one black, one white, compete to direct the fortunes of the T. C. Edwards High School football team facing integration in 1971 Virginia. An enormous 300 pound plus blonde good old boy modelled on the late Chris Farley, is the first player character.  He seems to have arrived on the Titans with none of the polarized racial animousities of the other players.  His ready wit softens some of the early conflicts. SPOILER ALERT Two leaders emerge immediately.  One is a beefy white guy with a lot of fairly racist attitudes.  Interestingly, he and another black guy become good friends before school starts as the team works out at a nearby college. Some of the tensions subside as the players get to know one another.  Back on opening day at T.C. Edwards High, however, the brotherhood evaporates quickly.  The Team reenters the real world.  Girlfriends are lost, friendships become tentative, the race problem persists.A Sports alumni group wants to help white defensive coach Will Patton recover his head coaching job by seeing to it that black head Coach Denzel Washington loses the first game and his job.  Will Patton's acting is neutral and opaque for the first third of the movie.  He gives Coach Washington all the rope he can manage, to hang himself as head coach.  But since Patton also represents our moral perspective, his character is not allowed to actively do battle with Denzel Washington.  No problem. The white Coach has a five year old daughter with loads of attitude, a temper, and football know-how to boot.  Her character is absolutely unbelievable but her credible temper manages to represent Patton's feelings perfectly.  The Defensive Coach's daughter keeps the battle over team strategy hot in the absence of her symbol-ridden father.Somehow, despite the racial divisions on the team and in the community, the Titans win the first game.  Now it will be a battle to win all the games and the State Championship, a ridiculous expectation, given the divided community.  But, see, this is an opportunity for the various players to bury their animosities and pull for the common good.Meanwhile, a blonde army brat with a perfect quarterback throwing arm arrives to join the team.  He's from California, has long hair, no race attitudes, and he looks like Kris Kristofferson before he was 35, but after Kristofferson's right and left jawbones were surgically broken to give him that high cheekbone look. Oh yaeh, while the girls look on from a window at the school, the California 'hippy' practices Zen on the lawn.  Coach Washington has reservations. The Quarterback Adonis is given a minor haircut that only makes him look even more appealing. Then there is also a LeVar-Burton-like black guy who starts to show Coach Patton what a winner he is on defense.The two coaches have an uneasy truce.  Eventually, an effort is made to have the daughters of the two men play together.  Another uneasy stand-off. Washington's daughter plays with dolls.  Patton's daughter wants to shoot some hoops.The Titans roll through a series of games, each of which presents a new set of obstacles for the Titans, and especially Coach Patton.  Each opposing team has a White Cracker Coach, and typically there is another conspiracy to put Coach Patton back in charge of the Titans if he will only accept complicity in the plot against Coach Denzel Washington.  But Patton resists these overtures and the Titans winning streak continues.By now, the film is playing race cards as a substitute for drama.  The little playlets always end with a moral that is at least some way toward a position for racial harmony. And sometimes you get the feeling this movie is made with a moral cookie-cutter.But by two thirds of the way through the movie, each Coach begins to develop some respect for the others coaching abilities.  There is a racial incident when Patton's daughter is endangered after someone throws a brick through 'Coach Coon's' window while the two daughters are playing.  One coach contributes a set of plays that vastly improves the chances of the team.  The two rival Coaches bond, smile, occasionally slap one another on the back.Now the movie is starting to roll.  It is no longer necessary to balance every race incident that makes the whites look good, with another incident that makes the blacks look good.  The players are starting to pull together.  The soundtrack is staging a battle of musical tastes since the first practices at the religious college.  The black players try to bug the whites by singing Motown harmonies.  But eventually we are hearing the best of Cat Stevens and other white Seventies Music to help balance the musical equation.  The Team astounds by doing a Don Cornelius Soul Train Pimp Roll onto the field at the beginning of each game. Its as if this movie has collided with the cheer-leading Bring It On.You can guess where this is all headed.  To the Big Game.  This time there is no problem with crooked officiating.  The other team and its coach are not riddled with the varieties of cracker corruption we have seen from coaches and teams up to now.  The Titans are going to have to pull together despite their problems, because this time they are facing a real team with no particularly grating stereotypes.I was fairly disappointed  with the films efforts to strike its own racial balance. The way to get the movie mechanism working is to get Coach Patton to relax and smile.  When the film does that, the audience relaxes too. As it does, Remember the Titans gets good.  And when it does it becomes, uh.., memorable.Finally, there is the inevitable postscript.  Ten years later the Titans gather at the funeral of one among them who has fallen. The roughly 28 year old actors playing these roles need only don suits, mustaches and slightly different hairstyles to play their real ages for the funeral scene.  Meanwhile, the two little girls have been replaced by older actresses and Washington and Patton look exactly as they did earlier.Of course, this story was based on a real high school team.  The mandatory short profiles of Team members reveal that most of the white guys go on to professional careers.  Despite euphemisms, the heroic black players spend their working years in menial jobs, mostly around the old home town.  Its amazing the filmmakers risked letting old eternal truths like that one break through.",Null,0,0,12 October 2000
Twilight," Vampyr Love Means Never Having To Say You're Sorry., Never!
","The movie was great. Sun never came out, drizzled nearly every day. A rainy Washington, a dazzling vampire from an interesting vamp family. Somebody named Bella Swan's father, Sheriff's Department deputy Charlie Swan. That's the name of Marcel Proust's hero in the first of his seven novels, Swann's Way. Now I've got to find out if that is something the screenwriter dreamed up, or if the author was responsible. At first it was surprising, but about a third of the way through, you could see plainly how the author was going to keep the antagonism between the two characters roiling: The Vampire loves the girl so much, there's an inner struggle to keep himself from killing her and draining the blood from her body. Naturally, she eats that s**t up, as the FBI guy in Thelma and Louise would say. Each time the vamp goes through this 'I want so badly to fang you to death' routine, Bella becomes more bellicosely aggressive. Its startling to guys watching to see how she goes after him. Kristen Stewart who played the girl at the swap meet who has the brief love affair with the young kid in Into the Wild, is doing all the acting in this film. She is mostly submissive and passive but she is the audience's moral guide. She even tells her father to quit eating french fries at lunch, to have a salad like her. The vampire is having nothing, thank you. Stewart has Piper Laurie's chipmunk teeth from the fifties movies Laurie did with Tony Curtis. When you finally see that Bella has jumped on the side of the Family, you know the Studios have at least two sequels in mind, maybe three. Wonderful rainy Washington State exteriors. The look of the film is exquisite and effecting right through to the end of the film. They're leaving high school though, which means no more cheering for the Spartans. She hasn't graduated yet so its only fair that the family place her in Jacksonville High for her last two years. If she isn't in high school, the sequel is going to lose fire. Catherine Hardwicke, who directed the under-rated Lords of Dogtown (2005), which I thought one of the best films that year, was production designer on Three Kings in 1999, as well as on Antitrust and Vanilla Sky. Her direction here may make her the first new major woman director in the Big Leagues in awhile. The movie did $70 million this weekend, $4 million more than the James Bond opener did last week. Its a very big hit. I was scheduled to see the movie early Friday morning at 12:10 a.m., slept through the start, but took the trouble to drive by and discover 30 cars at the Rogers Theater in Sparta at 1:40 a.m.. That one showing in a thousand theaters early Friday at the same time, brought in $7 million. My niece pointed out to me that the film made back its cost including advertising and the cost of negatives on its first weekend, a rare feat in Hollywood. She heard about Twilight from a colleague where she worked in Chicago, and has read one or more of the four books. She is raring to see it today. I'm really onto this not because its a teen film- most of those are nose-holders, but because this is the latest example of an emerging genre known as the Blockbuster Chick Flick. As recently as last year, they were considered risky by H'wood. The reason was that in couple situations which were assumed to be a guy and a girl before the Massachusetts Supremes acted, the guy would choose the flick and it would be Unforgiven or the Hulk or some other male clunker like Appaloosa. But now more than ever, young people are bowling alone. The Studios pulled out the stops for the movie version of Sex and the City. That film was loaded with anti-Male jabs designed to infuriate young guys but at the same time pluck at the strings of a girl's heart. Masochist that I am, I found myself loving those jabs. In the nearly all woman theater where I saw Sex and the City, selected couples were forging the beginnings of same sex marriages as I watched. uh, the film. My niece has since purloined my single copy of Sex and the City forcing me to return to Red Box for a fresh one to make a copy from. Its no fun to watch at home, though, without a bunch of frenzied women in the seats nearby. Since then I have been to every chick flick, even the bad ones like 27 Dresses and the rest of the Judd Apatow awfulness, which aren't just chick flicks but also wallow in male excess like f*rting. Before Sex and the City, women clung to their copies of the Notebook DVD and other Nicholas Sparks tearjerkers. Sparks' latest, Nights in Rondanthe, was a limited success, possibly because there wasn't enough male bashing in it. Its a great time to be alive even with the financial world melting. But parents need to cut back in their efforts at reviving Ophelia. Its young Hamlet who needs resuscitation most.",Null,1,8,24 November 2008
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Ed Murrow Comes From 'Out of the Past'
","At the 1960 conventions on CBS, Murrow, Erik Sevaraid, Charles Collingwood and others would gather in a dark room off the convention floor and analyze events. Wreaths of smoke curled overhead, half blinding the audience. Everyone smoked during those post-convention sessions. Good Night and Good Luck has Ed Murrow smoking during the famous Joe McCarthy documentary on See It Now. The real Ed may have used a cigarette as a prop interviewing Marilyn Monroe but never on See It Now, his serious show. George Clooney co-wrote, directed and appears as Murrow's producer Fred Friendly. I've read twelve books about Murrow, McCarthy and McCarthy Counsel Roy Cohn, but I thought Jeff Daniels was playing CBS President Frank Stanton, not CBS News President Sig Mickelson, until the credits rolled.Straithern must have dieted seriously for Good Night and Good Luck. He is seriously thin in the movie. Murrow's gauntness emphasizes the stress he endures and foreshadows the cancer he will die of eleven years later. David Strathairn has never looked as old and frail in a film as he does here. Strathairn's performance is difficult to accept for those of us who remember Murrow. Strathairn doesn't want to do a straight imitation, he wants to act the part. When he says good night and good luck he turns away as he says good luck. Ed would never have done that. Strathairn is being pinched by the many constraints of the role.In the film Murrow smokes incessantly. Murrow to Fred Friendly: 'Freddie, every time you light my cigarette, I know you're lying to me.' The movie opens with the Murrow staff at CBS in Manhattan preparing to canonize an Air Force Sergeant who has been tossed out of the Service because his father reads subversive magazines.Already CBS Chairman Bill Paley is feeling stomach pains and Friendly and Murrow haven't mentioned the McCarthy show.The audience needs to stretch its legs in this one, but Clooney keeps the action mostly confined to the studio.Robert Downey Junior has little to do here as a member of the Murrow Documentary team. Patricia Clarkson plays his wife and colleague at CBS. Clarkson registers as a bright spot among the shadowy, Noirish filmmakers. She lifts the energy of Murrow's Raiders each time she appears. The film brightens too.Jeff Daniels is cynical as Mickelson the news chief, Paley's henchman overseeing the Murrow crew. But Frank Langella's CBS Chairman Bill Paley is more chilling than the Dracula Langella played twenty years ago. Clooney is average as Murrow Producer Fred Friendly, though he must have put on 60 pounds to play the part.Clarkson, Daniels and Langella have to make way for Ray Wise, who plays WCBS anchorman Don Hollenbeck. Hollenbeck comes under siege from newspaper columnist Jack O'Brien. Wise, who has mostly played showy characters in low budget films, manages a brilliant performance with little screen time.There are fabulous ironies buried in the film. Murrow is smoking himself to death while one of his sponsors shows a spot on his program saying Kent cigarettes have filters on them that make them safe. I saw that commercial when I was an impressionable nine. I finally was able to stop nine years ago.Alcoa sponsors See It Now. Its cornball commercials run unremarked upon by Murrow and his men. Liberace is interviewed on the popular but lightweight Person to Person Ed hosts to balance the books at CBS for losses on See It Now. He asks a youngish Liberace when he is likely to get married, another irony since everyone knows now the flamboyant piano player was gay.The film uses the real McCarthy from film clips, and the real Liberace. Only once did I hear the real Ed's voice on the track. Assistant Defense Counsel Bobby Kennedy could be seen in clips along with Arkansas Senator John McClellan and Missouri Senator Stuart Symington. Archive film integrates smoothly with acted material.Murrow colleague Eric Sevaraid said that Ed was late going after McCarthy. Clooney uses a less dramatic part of Army Counsel Joseph Welch's attack on McCarthy to make it appear it was Murrow who slew Joe and not Welch at the McCarthy Hearings. But it was neither Murrow nor Welch who finished Joe. McCarthy Committee Chief Counsel Roy Cohn and Private David Schine earlier toured Embassies and US Information Agency stations in Europe with the press in tow. The two censored and replaced books like a couple of disciples of Joseph Goebbels. The Press had a field day mocking them. McCarthy backed up Schine and Cohn with an investigation of the Army after it balked at letting Schine be relieved from duty to serve on Joe's staff. It would have been the moral equivalent of the Army assigning PFC Elvis Presley to serve as assistant to Sun Records Producer Sam Phillips.One day during the three months of the McCarthy hearing Welch needled Cohn and McCarthy with an absurd conversation about 'pixies,' a sly attempt at unmasking Cohn's homosexuality to hip viewers, while subtly informing McCarthy that Welch had sharks teeth too. Welch's dramatic condemnation of Joe for revealing Welch colleague Fred Fisher as a member of a Communist Party Front was left on Clooney's cutting room floor. That missing footage was powerful enough to get Welch a role as Judge in the film Anatomy of a Murder.McCarthy was censured by the Senate and died three years later of acute cirrhosis. A decade later Poet Alan Ginsberg came to Appleton, Wisconsin for a poetry reading and afterward danced on Joe's grave.Good Night and Good Luck is a movie for cynics. A film for people who lived during the era and cracked wise. Even the New York Times couldn't resist a wise guy tout for the film: 'SEE IT NOW!'",7,4,6,12 December 2005
8 Mile," Good film of its kind, but not up to Curtis Hanson standards
","**Some Spoilers**Eminem's 8 Mile movie did $54.5 million its first weekend.  It was a pretty fair movie, but it wasn't great.  Eminem has about one face- a defiant, fierce look- to display to the camera. The director is Curtis Hanson, who gave us the extraordinary LA Confidential and the not so extraordinary Wonder Boys with Michael Douglas.  Kim Basinger plays Rabbit's trailer trash Mom, who is divorced, of course, and going out with a guy only 2 years older than Eminem's 20 year old character Jimmy.  At one point Eminem is talking with his Mom and she blurts out something about how her boyfriend won't do something with her sexually. Rabbitt pushes her away and shouts 'Mom, I can't discuss that with you.' Basinger got an Oscar for Best Actress in LA Confidential but she won't get one here.  This is a better movie than you would expect from a rock star but its still not first rate.There are a lot of black people in support of the Eminem character. The setting is ghetto Detroit.  Rabbit hangs around with black guys and has learned to rap with the best of them.  But he's afraid to go head-to-head in a Rap contest at a local nightclub, even though his good friend is announcer and MC of the contest.  Sorting people into heroes and villians is a bit of a trick for the storytellers. In the end, Rabbit is the good guy and a group of rival blacks are the bad guys.  If Rabbit hadn't had his own group of more loveable blacks (to the audience) backing him, this politically incorrect maneuver couldn't have been pulled off.  Toward the end, when Basinger's boyfriend has ditched her and she has received an eviction notice, she wins $3,400 at a Bingo parlor and so the trailer is saved.With that kind of encouragement, Rabbit summons the chutzpah and poetry to compete in the rap contest and shrewdly beat the black contestants who three scenes earlier had beaten him up pretty badly. Among the character actors supporting Eminem are a white Michael J. Pollard lookalike and a pretty funny and large Forrest Whitaker clone.  Everyone has seen a variation on this story before, but with Eminem in it, there is apparently all the difference in the world.There's a minor trend in this movie and another with Adam Sandler. The good directors like Hanson have thrown in the towel trying to get quality scripts and have just decided to compromise their highbrow film esthetic with pop culture.  Paul-Thomas Anderson of Boogie Nights and Magnolias fame has made a minor art movie with Sandler in the lead, pulling the same routine as Hanson does with Eminem. So, the actor isn't so hot!  No problem. Find out what the actor can manage, actingwise, then select a simple enough story so the actor can play the role.  The new Sandler film is called Punch Drunk Love. I'll probably go have a look see.  It will be the first Adam Sandler I've ever looked at, since this guy's comedies are unbearably dumb and unfunny.  Emily Watson and Phillip Seymour Hoffman, extraordinary character actors, are there to back up Sandler. The movie might even be good.",Null,0,0,11 November 2002
The Insider," All The Kings Horses and All The Kings Men Can't put the Watergate Era Back Together Again!
","In 1976, Alan Pakula's All The President's Men was released.  Those were heady days for journalism.  In the period since , the enthusiasm over the Watergate investigation has waned considerably.  Then Woodard & Bernstein became stars and millionaires.  Today many newsmen are millionaires. People wonder if these guys still share their values. Walter Cronkite is no longer in the anchor chair. Viewers have fled the big Three for Cable.  The cable news networks define news coverage for all other national news outlets.  Cable News and syndicated tabloid magazine shows give fits to the news divisions at CBS, NBC and ABC, which produce newscasts that are less serious than ever in order to remain competitive.  And Americans are about to flee television itself, for the Internet.Against this backdrop director Michael Mann gives us The Insider, a film every bit the equal in seriousness to All the President's Men.  Russell Crowe plays Tobacco Executive Jeffrey Wigand.  Al Pacino is Sixty Minutes Producer Lowell Bergman. Wigand has just been fired from his $300,000 a year job.  Bergman wants help deciphering a tobacco industry document. The two of them start an uneasy relationship.  The film suggests Wigand's employer began spooking his family BEFORE the executive agreed to become a whistleblower for Sixty Minutes. I doubt that is true.Soon the two men are developing the story.  The Mississippi Attorney General's office wants Wigand to testify.  Reporter Mike Wallace (Christopher Plummer) is brought in to interview Wigand.  Executive Producer Don Hewit (Anthony Michael Hall) is brought on board.  Brown & Williamson gets wind of Wigand's betrayal. Bergman says it wasn't him who tipped B&W. Wigand begins a new job as a high school science teacher. Brown and Williamson assigns detectives to follow him and make trouble for Wigand's family.  The Tobacco giant plants anti-Wigand stories in other Press outlets in anticipation of the Sixty Minutes bombshell.  Wigand's wife and daughter leave him.  He loses his home and the wife divorces him.The story keeps developing and the pressure builds.  But the biggest problem is inside CBS itself.  CBS Legal learns that Wigand has a contract with Brown & Williamson that provides for serious financial penalties if Wigand reveals ANY of its secrets, and CBS is liable too.  All of a sudden the story is threatening the financial interests of the Network itself.  Wallace and Hewitt agree to back off. Bergman is livid. He says CBS owner-CEO Laurence Tisch is betraying the news division because he is afraid a major liability suit will queer plans he has to sell the network to Westinghouse.  Left out of the script is the news that the Tisch family owned Loews controls Lorillard, another of the seven giant tobacco companies in America.  Even director Michael Mann had to make some concessions.  He must have bargained away this embarassing little detail when making his own deal with CBS over what would appear in the script.Bergman has to tell Wigand the story has been squelched. After all he has had to put up with, Wigand is more than disappointed. Bergman begins leaking CBS' betrayal of the news division to other press outlets.  Wallace is now angry that his own part in the coverup has been revealed.  He and Bergman quarrel. The Producer is furloughed for a week by Hewitt.  But CBS News has a black eye that would make Edward R. Murrow roll over in his grave.  Wallace has a brilliant public relations ploy. Lets go over to Black Rock (CBS Corporate) and sell them a package that will save all  our reputations.  I won't tell you what the deal is though you can probably make a good guess.The film is two hours and 37 minutes long.  It doesn't drag but its a very long sit for a film audience that is mostly under 30 and more interested in special effects than public affairs.  In 1976 the film would have been hailed as something like the Second Coming.  Today, a film like this is released with almost no fanfare. Its only hope is to capture enough awards to alert the mostly 35 and older audience that has abandoned filmgoing, at least in theatres.  Two years ago, Crowe made a boffo debut in a wonderful film called LA Confidential that was soundly trounced at the Awards by the Carnivorous, youth-oriented Titanic.  And Crowe, whose performance is tempered in this role, is one of the greatest screen actors to hit these shores since Marlon Brando, James Dean, George C. Scott and Tony Hopkins.  Because he still insists on acting at a time when appearing in monster special effects packages is the key to success.., because of this, Crowe's success as a film actor is still not a cinch.There are other actors in this film that are wasted.  Any film that would use Rip Torn as little as this one does, deserves a slap.  Torn plays PR man John Scanlon, but he barely speaks a sentence.  British actor Michael Gambon plays a high executive at B&W.  His screentime is minimal.  And Mann repeats a video clip of Gambon repeatedly.  The guy who lit a welding torch to reshape the Otter's Uncle's Lincoln in Animal House 21 years ago is wonderful as one of the courtroom lawyers from Mississippi.  Wings Hauser, the aptly named and wonderfully over -the-top B-movie actor who usually is larger than Richard Simmons onscreen, is subdued here as a B&W lawyer at a Mississippi court hearing.  Speaking of subdued, the most interesting performance is Christopher Plummer's subtle underplaying of Mike Wallace.  Plummer's Wallace almost seems to be subordinate to producer Bergman.  I wonder if Wallace is really this quiet around his colleagues at the network. The Plummer portrayal is in savage contrast to the Mike Wallace we are used to on-air.  Plummer makes no attempt to imitate the on-air Wallace.  His delivery is sufficiently newsman-like, but it is not the hard-hitting TV character we are used to. Gina Gershon is sharp and sharklike playing the CBS Lawyer who deflates the team's hopes of putting the story on the air. And former New York Post Editor and columnist Pete Hamil plays a reporter-editor at the New York Times, one of the few Gotham publications he has not worked for.I wasn't crazy about this film, but in a debased American Cinema, the Insider stands out just because it is directed to an adult sensibility.  There are many adults who will not enjoy this film. Its been a long time since Watergate. Not everyone is interested anymore.",Null,1,2,8 November 1999
Pride & Prejudice," Only Mister Bennet to Keep Bounders and Cads at Bay
","Pride and Prejudice has a fantastically fast-moving opening at an Upper Middle Class social gathering and dance. We're introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Bennett and their five daughters in the middle of things.The Bennet Daughters are there to capture husbands like every sensible woman in late 18th century England. The spirited dancing seems to ape the emotions of the Bennet girls as they wander about.The dance features not the usual snobbish Brits but rather a free- wheeling group of normal socialites reflecting the carefree, not posh and not snobbish Bennets, their five daughters and assorted friends.Keira Knightley plays Elizabeth Bennet, Donald Sutherland her besieged, droll rather appalled father. Mr. Bennet, as in the book, is called Mister even by his daughters. Every man is Mister. It makes the movie funnier contrasting the formality of the Misters with the convivial and fun-loving play of the Bennet girls.Mrs. Bennet is a shimmering pile of unspent emotional fiery. The girls at any moment, mother included, are likely to lose their heads at the sight of a man with 5,000 a year. That is if they're not having a joke at his expense at the time.At those moments, Mr. Bennent retreats to his study, where he has a new plant to look at.Only Mrs. Bennet is a straight fortune hunter. The Bennet girls somehow have found time to understand genuine love, though Mr. Bennet seems as unaware of this as Mrs. Bennet. Mr. Bennet seems to have sense you see. How the girls learned of true love is a mystery.Jane Austen's novel is set in a predatory England. A man with 1,000 pounds will stir interest. A man with 5,000 could drive the Bennet girls to revelries of screaming and shouting.Austen predates Dickens and the Bronte Sisters, but the Director has managed to include visuals lifted right from the heather of Wuthering Heights and has placed Elizabeth in settings that just do not exist in the somewhat hardscrabble back yard of the lower middle class Bennets. There is an instance or two of an enormous boar in the house for instance. Elizabeth escapes home with a flock of ducks fluttering about, seeming to imitate her. The image is stolen from the thirties David Copperfield, copied again with great effect in Tom Jones. The only true snob in the film is Mister Darcy. Poor Mister Darcy, he cannot bring himself to speak to most women, considering them trivial. He boorishly connives to torpedo Elizabeth's sister Mary's budding romance with the handsome though high-haired Mr. Bingley.At the dance opening of the film, Elizabeth finds Darcy odd at first, then turns squarely against him after encountering his more offensive traits. The audience knows that both are intrigued and Darcy may even be smitten.There is Mr. Collins, who, spotting Elizabeth at the dance, immediately cocks his hat for her. Only Lizzy is taller than he, his designs on her seem more about money than love, and besides, he and the film are moving too fast.There's room for one bounder in the shape of Mr. Wickham, who, it develops, knows and dislikes Mr. Darcy as much as Elizabeth and tells her so. A frame or two later he has run off with one of Elizabeth's sisters. Mr. Collins too finds matrimonial bliss in Elizabeth's friend who confides to Elizabeth that she hasn't attributes enough to wait for love to arrive at her door as Elizabeth has.The new Pride and Prejudice is certain to be compared with the 1995 BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy and Jennifer Ehle as Elizabeth. Keira Knightley, who ran away with the movie King Arthur two years ago, owns this film too. Unlike the miniseries, she doesn't really have to share with this Mr. Darcy (Matt McFadyen). Knightley seems to be at once Audrey Hepburn and Winona Ryder. Judy Dench, almost a necessity now in every British period film, plays Darcy's high-handed and very rich aunt with her usual bombast.Some screen notes say actress Emma Thompson gave this fast-paced screenplay a touch-up that is uncredited except at the end. I laughed more at this film than I did at the '95 miniseries.I could hear all of Darcy's, Mr. Bennet's, and Elizabeth's lines, but the rest was sometimes too British to understand. Still, one could read body language just as well in many scenes. Director Joe Wright pushed the movie along at a torrid pace. At times his camera moves in and out of doors and windows peering at the bewildering contrasts in attitudes of the many lovers and players in just seconds.I recommend that everyone see it. Its very funny. When Mr. Bennett learns Elizabeth finally wants to wed Mr. Darcy after all, he becomes teary when telling his daughter why, totally stealing the scene from Miss Knightley. Score one for Mister Bennet.Laurence Olivier and Greer Garson were Darcy and Elizabeth in the first 1940 version. An Indian Directress who re-filmed Vanity Fair in 2004 put out a Bollywood version of Pride and Prejudice early this year. The present version, more than the miniseries, reminds that Louisa May Alcott borrowed heavily from Austen's Pride and Prejudice to produce Little Women in 1869. The two novels have nearly the same structure. Pride and Prejudice is a first instance of Chick Lit written in English. Its a story of girls for girls and any male who wants to learn a few things about them they hadn't known.",10,1,2,13 December 2005
The Red Violin," Son of Michael Powell's 1948 The Red Shoes with a new coat of red paint
","The Red Violin has trouble deciding whether it is a costume picture or an art movie.  The film traces the history of a rare violin from its birthplace in 1681 Italy.  The instrument is headed for a 1998 auction house to be sold. Enter expert Samuel L. Jackson.  Jackson knows rare violins.  He recognizes this piece as one of a kind. Its not a Stradivarius. Its even more refined, a handmade instrument from an old Italian craftsman.  Jackson is not the only one who sees through the plain trappings of the violin.  A young scientist who measures the richness of fiddle acoustics, is also onto the red violin. The young man is actor Keith Gordon the same young skeptic who doubts Rodney Dangerfield's attempts at getting an education in the 1986 film Back to School. The Red violin is so famous there are knock-offs and copies circulating in the rare violin marketplace.As I mentioned, the first four historic scenarios through which the vintage violin travels are costume pieces.  They are also choppy and differ in detail, authenticity and tone from the last auction house episode. On top of that the auction mystery is so richly separate in tone and character from other sequences, it is as if separate filmmakers were working here.One sequence features a Viennese landowner who retrieves the instrument from a band of gypsies who are trespassing on his property.  The aristocrat is a true eccentric.  The music  he plays  on the Red Violin is extraordinary. His love affair with absurd European Duchess Greta Schacchi is so unnecessary, the episode plays like farce.Another episode takes us to China in the early 20th century then moves the daughter whose mother buys the pawned violin for her, to China's cultural revolution of the '60s. All old things are now considered reactionary. Violins are instruments which play 'decadent western music.' The young girl, now grown up, takes flight to save the instrument.  This sequence echoes the ridiculous woodenness of the cultural revolution itself.  Characters are reduced to counterrevolutionary sloganeering. Its difficult to believe even the Maoists of that period could have cared so much about an off-colored violin.Scenes from the the first 17th century period when the instrument is made, explain its strange color.The last sequence is a mystery.  It pays off a story  that has been difficult to follow.  The auction sequences take place in a European Capital, though the actors appear to be Canadians.  Fittingly, the actor who actually auctions this fiddle played the title character in Thirty Two Short Films about Glenn Gould. The 1998 auction sequence saves the whole film from being little more than a comic book. Most of the violin music played throughout the films is exquisite and interesting in its variety and range.Samuel Jackson, Keith Gordon and the many others in the last sequence are superb. The last part redeems the entire film.  The screenwriting is fine here as is the camerawork. The color photography, if I have failed to mention it, seems excessively red.",Null,0,0,7 September 1999
The Departed," Without Nicholson, Departed Would Have Been Better
","The Departed is pretty good, but not because its large cast is good or because of Martin Scorcese's direction.Its good because the original Chinese film its copied from, Infernal Affairs (2004) was probably a superior script. I'm rushing to get a copy from Netflix as we speak.The story is about two impersonators who have infiltrated the Boston Police Department. One is employed by the Police Department to find any moles who might have penetrated the force. The other works for Boston Mobster Frank Costello, not related at all to the Mafioso who rapped his knuckles on a congressional desk in the fifties during a televised hearing about organized crime.Jack Nicholson plays Costello and wrecks the movie pretty much. In interviews this weekend, Nicholson said he wasn't inclined to be in the film because the Costello role was little more than a cameo. But Scorcese had the part built up for Nicholson, hurting the film in the process.The film is a tightly wound tale of intrigue about moles inside the Boston department. Leo De Caprio and Matt Damon play the spies. De Caprio is better than Damon but not by much. De Caprio knots up his forehead too often in order to be taken seriously as a slightly troubled cop.There's a certain amount of advanced technology to sleuth the mystery the audience already knows the answer to. But this is a great script.Jack Nicholson's Costello is over the top, damaging a pretty good film substantially. De Caprio is off his mark too.But this is the best Scorcese film in years, better than Gangs of New York or the Aviator, both of which were directed by Scorcese and both of which featured Leonardo De Caprio.Nicholson is so awful and such a gargoyle, he reminds me of Burl Ives, who was terrible as Big Daddy in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof in 1958. Nicholson is almost always miscast and overacting these days. I think the last decent film he did was the Postman Always Rings Twice in roughly 1980. He hasn't been good in anything since, but they keep paying him as if he's a bankable star.Other actors in what is supposed to be an ensemble film include Mark Wahlberg, Martin Sheen, Alex Baldwin, Vera Farmiga and Krista Dalton. Dalton is a newcomer and is quite good. But Baldwin, Farmiga and Wahlberg don't get enough time to act with Nicholson chewing scenery all the time. The film, due to its extraordinary plot and a series of film surprises, is quite good, despite everything.",6,4,8,9 October 2006
Glory Road," Glory Road: The True Story Behind the Film
","An upstart all black Texas Western Comes from nowhere to win the NCAA Division One Basketball title in 1966. Glory Road is the story of a seminal moment in American College Basketball. In Glory Road, Don Haskins (Josh Lucas) is coaching a girls high school team in rural West Texas when the call comes from Texas Western of El Paso. The film implies Haskins started the basketball program at Tex-West from scratch in 1965, the season the Miners went all the way against Adolph Rupp's Kentucky in the NCAA Final.In reality, Haskins was in his fourth year at El Paso in 1965. He did not initiate the program as the film implies, nor did he draft Tex-West's first black players. He inherited a team with three black players on it, in his first year as coach, 1961. The movie has Haskins arriving at El Paso in 1965 having just left a high school girls basketball coaching job. The Coach finds he is really being hired to keep order in a college dormitory where he and his wife and two children will be forced to live. Texas Western isn't that interested in basketball. Haskins is unable to draft first rank white players. In desperation, he sends his assistant to Harlem, and tries to attract black playground players himself in Indiana and other urban settings. In reality, Texas Western was among the first of southern colleges to integrate its sports teams. Glory Road implies that 1966 was the year integration finally penetrated NCAA Basketball. But the University of Cincinnati won the NCAA with four black players in 1962. Loyola won the title with four black players in 1963. By 1966, not many years after the comic black Globetrotters had beaten the all-white Minneapolis Lakers, the NBA's leading players were black: Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson and Elgin Baylor.So how could the Kentucky-Texas Western Showdown be the moment the NCAA was integrated? It wasn't. It was, instead, the year the mostly southern, Atlantic Coast Conference which had been dragging its feet on team integration, saw the race issue blow up in its face.Haskins played five black players nearly every game that year, and assembled a 27 and l record, the same record Rupp's Kentucky finished the Season with. Noise about the team kept drifting into the nation's sports pages. But few Americans saw the team play. No one dreamed the upstart black team could challenge the traditional white teams of the ACC.In the movie El Paso has seven black players and two token whites. The screenplay creates story points out of thin air to create audience support for Texas Western. The screenplay has Tex-West players doing 180 degree slam dunks, but there was no play like that in the NCAA basketball of 1965-66.Coach Haskins is shown forcing his largely black players to play the game the 'White Way.' In fact playground basketball technique had not yet become an issue in the 1965 NCAA. A story point in Glory Road has Haskins losing several games, then having to give in and let the team 'play black.' In fact, the Miners played disciplined white basketball.'Play one at home, two on the road and three if you get behind.' This is the supposed comfortable adage about how a coach should use black players in the South. Its a great legendary saying. But integration took place so quickly, there was little time for the saying to take hold and have meaning. Before Brown vs. the Board of Education there were no blacks playing on Southern College Teams. After the NBA integrated, the NCAA followed quickly in its footsteps. In '66-'67, the year after tiny Texas Western won it all, Haskins had no blacks in his starting lineup. By 1969 even Rupp had his first black player.Don Haskins is a legend, but he never again placed a team in the NCAA Finals. The luck and talent that assembled and trained this great team in 1965-66, did not repeat. Still the NCAA Final Game between Rupp's Kentuckians and Haskins' black Tex-Wests IS a great drama. Americans and most NCAA Teams had read stories about the upstarts, but few had ever seen them play. Only one Atlantic Coast Conference Basketball game a week appeared on national TV then. With no previous reputation, Tex-West had appeared not once on television. The team was only seen where they played. The five black men all on the floor at the same time scared some college teams that had not played a totally black team before.Actor John Voight disappears in makeup to make him look the image of Adolph Rupp. Voight has obviously studied game films of Rupp. His portrayal is like nothing seen from him before. The Rupp on screen is a jowly, elderly man with a load of mannerisms and tics. Voight's performance is a tour de force. This must be close to the way the real Rupp looked and acted.As the credits rolled at the end the real Don Haskins appears in black and white inset and tells of his experience. A photo of the real Adolph Rupp shows how close to reality John Voight's makeup was. Haskin's remarks crosscut with black and white game footage. Kentucky player Pat Riley then appears and adds a stunning perspective to the events of March, 1966. Riley, now an NBA coach, says he went to the Miners' locker room after he'd recovered some and congratulated the black players.Riley said no one realized the significance of the game immediately. But as years went by it started to dawn. Riley says it was hard to accept that the black team was that much better than Kentucky then. Over the years he says he has come to see that accepting that was owning up to the dignity and the triumph of their effort.",8,5,11,16 January 2006
Downfall," Downfall is Best Film About Hitler and the Nazis Ever Made
","I've seen a trashier version of Hitler's last ten days in the Berlin Bunker. It stars Alec Guinness as Der Fuhrer. Though it used Hugh Trevor-Roper's account of the last ten days, it was the usual blend of stereotypes and caricatures. I think I have seen Anthony Hopkins as Der Fuhrer somewhere too. But neither Guiness nor Hopkins could do justice to Schickelgruber without a serious movie wrapped around them.This is a German-made movie that is genuine enough to warrant being taken seriously.One problem a serious drama about Nazis in the Berlin Bunker is how to create heroes and villains.A good film never creates heroes and villains simply. They come in shades. Downfall has the shading right.The screenplay is pulled from two accounts of Hitler's last days, one of them by the then young stenographer he had hired only two years before the end of the Thousand Year Reich that made it just a few days longer than 12 years.Incidentally, tho the US TV Press has been hyping the fall of Saigon 30 years ago this week, yesterday (Saturday, April 30, 2005) is the 60th anniversary of the death of Adolph and Eva, who jointly committed suicide. I saw this movie the day after Adolph and Eva's 60th Anniversary as a married couple. Never mind that the marriage didn't even last a full day.Let me tell you the lengths the film went to be accurate. Joseph Goebbels had a childhood bout with polio that left one leg four inches shorter than the other. The limp he had as a result was portrayed accurately in the movie. Many Nazi film accounts make few distinctions in the uniforms of the Reich. Goebbels was the Gauleiter of Berlin, in addition to being the Propaganda Minister. His orangish sport coat uniform is a detail often missed in films about the Nazis.The screenplay pulls few punches. Those who know the Bunker melodrama from reading Hugh Trevor-Roper or William Shirer carry the details in their head.Magda Goebbels' murder of her five children is shown in a detail even Magda would have been interested in seeing. The Whole bunker is full of talk about suicide by all manner of major and minor Nazis as Der Furher contemplates his End. Everyone has a cyanide pill at the ready.Magda only married her womanizer husband to get closer to Hitler. The movie suggests she was the most soulless of Hitler's sycophants. Her husband Joseph doesn't have the guts to put the children to death. But Magda consults with the Bunker chemist to make a bitter-tasting drink to drug the kids before the ultimate cyanide crunch.Through several scenes, the Goebbels children are portrayed as having a grand old time playing in the Bunker as the sands ooze out of the hourglass. The kids are dressed like caricatures of happy schoolchildren and appear to have no sense the end is near.Except one daughter is suspicious and Magda shows increasing concern that this one daughter will tip the others before she can bring off the 'final solution' for the kids.The happy Bunker kids are mostly buying Magda's claim the potion being offered them is just a mild sedative. But the suspicious daughter says she doesn't want any and when Magda mildly insists, it doesn't work. Mother and chemist who mixed the heady brew have to force this daughter to drink it. A few minutes later Magda is shown placing a cyanide pills in each child's mouth and manipulating mandibles so the pill is crushed and does its work. The audience fears the recalcitrant daughter will awaken and put up a fight over the cyanide. We can tell Magda is worried too. But the reluctant daughter goes like the others.Magda goes outside the children's room and slinks to the floor in relief at having completed her gruesome task. The less courageous husband Joseph approaches and they play a few hands of cards while contemplating their own last moments.There are moral witnesses of all stripes to provide points-of-view of these events in the bunker. There is a humane doctor who opts for life and who is the main positive image in the film. Frau Jung, the stenographer who escapes with her life, is billed second to Hitler but is mostly a wide-eyed spectator with no opinion of events as they occur. At the end of the film, the real stenographer makes an appearance on film regretting her complicity while she worked for Hitler.Albert Speer, Generals Jodl and Keitel, Martin Boorman, Eva Braun, a veritable party animal, and assorted Nazis and non-Nazis come and go as the movie progresses.Der Fuhrer and others remonstrate with one another about the failures of the Reich, the German people, assorted generals. Heinrich Himmler, who attempts to surrender without permission, is believed a traitor. Eva's brother-in-law, whose wife, Eva's sister, is about to give birth, pays the ultimate price for disloyalty to Hitler. Eva begs for his life to no avail.The Germans have an oafishness to their language and comportment that is often considered funny by other Europeans and Americans. They are often pictured as drunkards, party animals and perpetual Octoberfesters. The Downfall is heavy on the oafishness. I think the Germans are like that, but, in context, it is a good thing. They are not as cynical as other Westerners. They are more soulful and serious.Downfall is a sad movie. The Audience finds itself on the side of many members of the Third Reich hierarchy. It is possible to feel degrees of sorriness for Adolph, Eva, even Goebbels and his wife.Everyone should see this film. A multi-part TV series made with the same degree of seriousness would be a hit around the world.",10,4,8,2 May 2005
La Vie En Rose," Edith Piaf - the Other Side of Midnight
","I've just finished watching the Edith Piaf biopic that came out this summer. The film is quite mysterious about the nature of all Piaf's various physical ailments. The actress playing her displays what appears to be a serious case of arthritis already in her teens. Piaf drank and used drugs from her teen years, and took drugs to snuff effects from three auto accidents. The amount of alcohol and drugs she ingested were the major, but mysterious backdrop to the film. It was difficult to understand why she started taking the drugs in the first place. She starts out as a poor urchin but by her teens she is partying night and day. The film captures her life as a tragedy. Its shocking to see this woman looking more like 84 than the 48 she actually is when her liver is giving out in 1963. I went and checked the wikipedia account against the film and found it mostly accurate. The film was not pleasant.The little Sparrow as she was nicknamed by a French Night Club Owner was unable to adapt to a normal lifestyle. Her drinking and drugging certainly contributed to her early death. Why not tell us about that?It was hard to watch this woman drag herself down. Why not show the story of Edith discovering a young male nightclub singer in a provincial club, falling in love briefly with him, then watching that same Yves Montand ascend to a career greater than her own? This story insists the audience already know Piaf's story and songs, as many of the French surely do. The film was made for a French audience and for HBO. It breaks the boundaries of the usual, predictable, triumphant biopic, which should have been a good thing. Americans may not even be able to understand what was different and important about Piaf from watching this fiercely critical French film.The English title of the film is the title of her most famous song, La Vie En Rose.",6,2,5,22 November 2007
Live Free or Die Hard," John McClane Falls Mainly on the Plain
","What distinguishes Die Hard films from the other thrillers with pyrotechnics, is the relationship the John McClane character has with his buddy and his antagonist, in the film. Sometimes, as tn the first Die Hard, the buddy and the antagonist are the same guy: 'Happy Trails, Hans!'The dialog that ensues from these relationships is sometimes superb and always interesting. Bruce Willis' John McClane distinguishes himself as something more than a show host serving up the blown up cars and imploded rail lines and bus terminals.McClane must relate.The new and most interesting curve in Die Hard Four is Matt Farrell (Justin Long), a charming and impish young geek and computer hacker, who in manner and demeanor is the opposite of the muscled take charge McClane.McClane is casually attempting to break up a relationship his daughter is having with a lowlife, when the FBI calls to have him do a routine pickup of Farrell, part of a larger roundup of computer hackers nationwide.McClane has trouble finding Farrell. Meanwhile, pandemonium is breaking out in the Y2K world of Terror that surrounds us today. A clean cut goody-two-shoes government anti-terror planner, smeared and fired for trying to alert the government how easy a high tech disaster could be launched, gets angry and decides to create mayhem and chaos himself.This clean cut Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant) is the bad guy match for McClane's affections, to Matt Farrell's shape-shifting slipperiness. That's good. McClane needs at least one guy who is simple and easy to understand.Gabriel is already setting off cherry bombs and firecrackers everywhere before the aging McClane -over fifty now and hairless- manages to track down and corral the smooth and elusive Farrell. McClane's capture is difficult. But Farrell backpedals with Matt pretending he is all cooperation with Mac, when in fact he is stalling and planning to escape.McClane really has almost no time to take him to the Precinct. Instead he finds himself enlisting Farrell's high tech know-how in a pinch. Farrell warns him, at one point, that if he tries to hot-wire this car the old low tech way, he is liable to set off the airbags knocking them both senseless. Farrell instead pulls a PDA from his backpack, and fakes his way into the car's computer to start it. McClane is impressed, but not admitting it.Quickly the FBI Bureau Chief Learns that Gabriel is so many leagues more sophisticated than Government agencies, it is going to be difficult to stop him let alone catch him. McClane learns that many of the other geeks in the roundup have been assassinated, except Farrell, who narrowly escapes that fate moments into his capture by McClane. Big John deduces that the murders have something to do with Gabriel's plot to show America how easily it can be devastated and reduced to a pile of steaming rubble.McClane eventually helps Farrell escape the clutches of the bureau so the two of them can track down and defeat the Gabriel Nemesis.They are a dynamic duo. McClane's stress becomes unmanageable when he learns that Gabriel has taken his daughter prisoner. I was for him bringing the lowlife boyfriend along for the ride because there would be more laughs, but the producers wouldn't listen to me.Young Farrell keeps riding to McClane's rescue, always diffident and fearful that he has no tactic that will work this time. Finally, Farrell pulls out the stops. He's out of ideas and needs to commune with HIS GURU from Philly: WARLOCK!McClane is leery about this tangent, but agrees finally. He and Farrell journey to a rundown alcove in Philly, Warlock's lair. It looks suspiciously like the ruins of the black neighborhood Philly's mayor ordered torched a few years ago, to quell an insurrection of black folks. The Audience is dismayed to learn that Warlock is just plain old Clerks Director Kevin Smith, now on his knees after several flops, and forced to play portly character parts in other people's films. You remember Kevin. He's the silent guy who stood outside the convenience and video stores in Clerks selling drugs, while his taller, slimmer partner dripped a patter of obscenity-laced sexual innuendos to passing women. Anyway, Kevin Smith is the Guru here. The audience reluctantly accepts this. Even Warlock, who has also narrowly missed being murdered, is out of gas idea-wise. Both he and Matt Farrell have been able to use the cell phone system even though it is dead for the rest of the country, by harnessing system algorithms through their PDAs. With this avenue fading too, the two geeks' blackberries gasping for power, Warlock and Matt go looking for some low tech information: they look up an address in the phone book.There are showdowns with Gabriel, attempts to save McClane's daughter at a power plant, more high tech derring-do, and many last minute saves of the doddering McClain by the Y generation Farrell. It all comes out in the end. The film is able to put its heel down in two major demos, the Ys and the Boomers, so the end is set to come out foursquare behind the values of movie audiences in both generations.Watch this space for a Revenge of the Nerds sequel to DH Four, when Farrell goes ballistic and tries to date McClane's daughter!",7,2,5,26 July 2007
Munich," Munich Has A Faulty Premise: Innocence
","'They're all gone,' intones sportscaster Jim McKay. McKay and other ABC news folks of 1972 have their TV footage mixed with a quick montage of violent filmed movie scenes of the '72 Olympics where 11 Israeli Olympians were massacred by the Arab Black September group.Five men led by a young Israeli named Avner are assembled to revenge the massacre of the Munich Olympians. The Munich Avengers hook up with a family that has been in private intelligence since the Vichy Government ran France during World War Two. Lebel (Michael Lonsdale) is its patriarch. He becomes a sage to the Five. 'Never work for any government' he warns. Well, its a little late to change that just now. At first everything goes swimmingly. The movie looks like other well made thrillers. These 'pros' who have never exactly done this kind of work in their lives 'seem' very successful. Thriller afficionados will remember Michael Lonsdale as the French inspector who traced assassin Edward Fox across France in the Day of the Jackal 33 years ago. Older and heavier, Lonsdale is right at home as patriarch of the French family aiding the Israeli assassins in targeting their victims.The Israelis find themselves sharing a room in Athens with five Arab Assassins but arrange a truce by convincing the Arabs they are part of the German Beider-Meinhof gang. Avner discusses middle east morality and politics with the Arab gang leader. Avner is seen by the audience as losing that argument. Later the forger has to 'fix' a foiled murder attempt in a hotel room. He is wounded. Several of the Arabs Avner's crew boarded with are killed in a gunfight outside. Carl (Cirian Hands) is murdered in bed later by a comely prostitute after Avner has turned the woman down. The Israeli avengers trace her to a Brussels houseboat where each fires a shot into her as she vainly attempts a seductive but grotesque striptease to save her life. An attempt to kill the architect of the Munich Murders is foiled when five Brits, posing as drunks, interfere. Avner's men are now aware they are being followed and watched. Who do the five Brits work for, the CIA or Britain's MI-6? The hunters are now the hunted.The foiled Assassination perplexes and demoralizes. Their Israeli handler Ephraim calls Avner home to tell him their work is splendid. Not to them it isn't. Avner doesn't want to continue. He suspects they have killed Arabs not involved in Munich and balks at giving names and addresses of contacts to Ephraim. They discover the CIA has protection deals with some of their targets. The remaining Four don't know who is after them or for what. Two more die and a demoralized Avner and Steve(Daniel Craig) split up.Afraid now, Avner flees to his wife and baby in Brooklyn. But unknown agents follow and scare him. Avener fears for his wife and child. He attacks a bureaucrat in the Israeli Mossad office in Manhattan. He is desperate now. Ephraim meets with him and admits some of the six killed were not Black September but old Israeli scores being settled. Avner won't cooperate with Israel now. And Ephraim won't help him if Avner doesn't agree to continue.Except for a nightmare-freighted, overdone sexual episode between Avner and his wife, the film is effectively over. Spielberg and screenwriter Tony Kushner have carved this thriller into a political morality tale. The Israelis cannot assume the higher moral ground if they are as murderous as Black September. Every act of revenge sews the seeds of more violence and death. What is the point of that, ask the Authors? An Arab character argues with Avner that the Jews in Israel are outnumbered by the Arab populations that are all around them and growing in numbers much faster than the Israelis. The Authors are saying the Israelis will never win, that time is on the side of the Arabs. Israel will not win and will not survive.I agree with them. The American War in Iraq will not succeed either. Americans and Israelis will both lose because the Arabs are fighting for their homeland. The Americans, and the Israelis who claim THEY are fighting for their homeland, cannot succeed.Spielberg and Kushner have loaded the dice too heavily here. Avner and his four henchmen have an underlying innocence about international terrorism calculated to buttress this story and its moral. But would the Israelis really have chosen such a bunch of innocent plebes to carry out a mission as cynical, dangerous and important as this one? Its a great story but it won't play in Bagdhad, Tel Aviv or Peoria not to mention on the big screen.",7,2,4,9 January 2006
