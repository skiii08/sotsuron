Sucker Punch," Zack Snyder I want my money back
","I went to watch this movie with out a clue as to what it was about, came out wishing i wouldn't know. To be frank i created a user with the sole purpose of keeping people away from this poor excuse for a movie. The acting was horrible especially Carla Gugino and Oscar Isaac. The story which I spouse could have been okay was butchered by the confusion which the lack of logic to the story created. to add salt to this tragedy the part which didn't involve CGI where boring as hell. The only plus side was that the CGI was pretty sweet. But unless all you care about is the CGI stay away. you've been warned , this thing is a total waste of time.",1,7,15,23 April 2011
