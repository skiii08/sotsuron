The Perks of Being a Wallflower," great movie
","i just the movie and it really hit me more than the book did i loved it and i think it's one of the best movies of this year. it had all for it to be great acting especially Logan(Charlie).Everyone else in their supporting roles all have their moments. Nina Dobrev, who plays Candance aka Charlie's sister, did a good job. Mae Whitman as Mary Elizabeth was hilarious. Adam Hagenbuch as Bob was great. Erin Wilhelmi as Alice, Johnny Simmons as Brad and Nicholas Braun as Derek were all fine. the writing was awesome by Stephen Chbosky and he did a great job directing it the music is just the right thing to this movie done by Michael Brook and he did a very good job. i gave it a 10 because it's worth watching again and again",10,0,1,13 December 2012
