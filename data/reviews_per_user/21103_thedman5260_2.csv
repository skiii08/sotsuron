Deja Vu," Non-stop suspense!!!
","I just got back from seeing 'Deja Vu' with some friends, and I must say, I have not seen such an original, truly suspenseful thriller in a good long while. Denzel Washington gives (As You might expect...) an awesome performance. Along with Val Kilmer, and Jim Caviazel. I have always been a rather big fan of Tony Scott's work, (Domino, Top Gun, Man on Fire.) And I was not disappointed with this one either. This movie provides top-notch suspense! A near two-hour movie truly felt like one hour. Jerry Bruckheimer and Tony Scott knew what they were doing. I recommend this movie to thriller lovers, and I cannot wait until the DVD comes out. I am not at all sorry I went to see this movie. It wasn't perfect, but it definitely was a really good, suspenseful thriller.",7,1,2,6 January 2007
The Prestige," Nolan does it again...
","I have been a rather large fan of Christopher Nolan's work, (Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia...) and The Prestige is no exception. It is extremely well directed and very well written. The acting is mostly amazing! I never though Hugh Jackman could do such a good job acting. And Christian Bale... Great! I was told about this movie from a friend of mine, and when he told me about it, I was really pessimistic about going to see it... Boy, was I wrong. I was expecting a movie that was long, boring, and just hard to watch... Take it from me, this movie is none of those three things. I definitely believe that this movie deserves its spot in the top 250. I even think it should be brought down into the low 100s, if not the high 90s. THis movie has made a spot in my top 5, and I really think this is one of very few modern-day masterpieces.",10,3,5,11 March 2007
