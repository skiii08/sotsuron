Hereditary," I regret spending money on this movie
","Wow. I thought this movie was going to be scary. I spent most of the movie wishing it was over. There was too much awkward acting. Scenes where I felt the actors and actress missed the point. The beginning was really slow and predictable. The entire movie was somewhat predictable. The only thing I didn't expect was that they actually succeeded in their plan to bring back Paloman. Or whatever his name is. My friend really liked this movie, but for me. It was lame. It tried to hard to be a contender for scariest movie and it fell short. It was campy and fells like a B rated movie. The plot left much to be desired, you also were left with more questions that honestly, I don't even care to answer. I honestly thought it would be a good movie because of the reviews. However, I was wrong. I don't usually watch horror movies, so I fully expected to be scared. I was just annoyed, the scariest (goriest) part was the end. And even that was dumb.",2,108,223,8 June 2018
