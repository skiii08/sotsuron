The Blair Witch Project," Don't bother
","This film sucks. If you like to watch whining students hiking through the woods and have a very nervous disposition you might, and I mean might, find this film slightly scary - I don't & I didn't. The idea for the film is very good but what I want to know is how they managed to spend $60,000 on this garbage, where did it go?. Personally I would recommend The Exorcist if you want a truly shocking film.",Null,2,3,2 November 1999
