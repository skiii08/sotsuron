Vertigo," Possibly the most overrated movie ever made
","You know what I think? I think everyone who has seen this film only remembers the ending. After a certain turning point near the end of the film, it lives up to it's reputation in every way. Up until then, it's a poorly paced, criminally overrated film.They call Hitchcock the 'Master of Suspense'. Sure he has earned the title, and films like Psycho, Frenzy or Rear Window are proof. Well, I don't know what happened but he was sure missing that gift in '58. Most of the film falls flat, and the first hour and a half or so, with a couple rare exceptions, drags on at a snails pace.The actors were good for the most part. Stewart gives a great performance from beginning to end, while Novak does her best work after the turning point. She seemed to be asleep for most of the first hour and a half. The supporting cast isn't awful, but not nearly as good as I would have expected.Now, there must be some reason why people hail this as Hitchcock's masterpiece? Of course there is: The ending. I wont ruin it for any of you who haven't forced yourselves to sit through this, but the ending is incredible. A couple good twists followed by a huge shocker, this is what people remember about the film.This is all-in-all a pretty lackluster film. The dream sequence and the ending are great, as are the lead actors, but everything else seems to fall flat. One of the most overrated films I've ever seen.6/10",6,8,17,12 June 2006
Walk the Line," Great!
","I should start out by saying a few things. First off, I'm definitely a fan of Johnny Cash, and if you aren't you likely wont share my opinions on this fine film. Second, the isn't much in the review that hasn't been said before...but it's my review, so sue me.Now, let me get this out of the way: The actors are phenomenal. All the praise, awards and nominations were wholeheartedly deserved. Phoenix does an incredible job as Cash, as does Witherspoon as June Carter. They are very believable together and both do a great job. There was some great work in the supporting cast as well, for example Tyler Hilton as Elvis Presley. He didn't have very much time on screen, which I think is a shame.Next, the music! On top of being great actors, Phoenix and Witherspoon show that they really have pipes! Not only are they very good singers, the sound very similar to their real-life counterparts. I almost felt like singing along at a few parts...but then I realised that I'd probably scare everyone away.The only thing I didn't particularly care for was the directing. It seemed very bland, and on top of that the editing was pretty bad in places.All in all this is a great movie to see, even if you aren't a Cash fan. Highly recommended.8/10",8,0,0,15 June 2006
Mission: Impossible III," Above-average brainless action
","Explosions, car chases, helicopters and non-stop action...what else would you expect? I was actually really surprised with this movie to be honest. Not having seen the other 2 films in the series I didn't really know what to expect, however I had it pegged as a brainless action flick. Though I wasn't exactly wrong in that assumption, it was better than your typical brainless action flick. Tom Cruise does a pretty good job as usual, but he wish more of his screen time would have been used on the supporting cast, Philip Seymour Hoffman in particular. He was a great villain, but we didn't get to see him nearly as much as I would have liked. Simon Pegg's small role was great as well. The plot was basic and straight-forward, but definitely exciting. I wish they would have spent less time on the whole family aspect though, a pointless and failed attempt to give the movie a deeper meaning. The effects were great of course, but the bridge scene went on way too long. It was like they had an explosion quota they had to meet. Despite it's flaws, however, it put a smile on my face, put me on the edge of my seat and kept me entertained for it's duration. Abd in the end, that counts for more than you'd expect.7.5/10",7,0,1,13 May 2006
Who Framed Roger Rabbit," Magical
","When I'm not feeling great, there's nothing Id rather do than sit back with a nice cold can of Coke and good, light comedy. Let me tell you folks, it doesn't get much better than this. A classic in the truest sense of the word. Bob Hoskins makes for a great private eye, easily one of the best roles I've seen him in. I always like to see Christopher Lloyd as a villain, and here he's at his over-the-top maniacal best. Of course, how could I not mention the effects? The toons fit seamlessly into the 'real world', and Hoskins fits just as perfectly in Toon Town. Speaking of Toon Town, that is easily one of the best parts of the movie, filled with classic cameos, great effects, and hilarious gags. Overall this is one of the funniest movies you'll ever see as well as pure movie magic all-around.9.5/10",9,0,0,12 May 2006
Hostel," Not great
","Let me start by saying that I wasn't really interested in seeing this movie in the first place. It looked pretty dumb, but I thought I should see it just to see what all the fuss was about. That said, now that I've seen it, I still think it's a dumb movie, and still cant see what the fuss is about.I had the same problem as a lot of people with this movie: It starts out like a bad porno. By the time it becomes an actual horror movie, it had already lost my interest. The gore was good, the acting was surprisingly decent, but the plot was so mind-numbingly awful that I really couldn't enjoy it much.Basically, this movie is well made and well acted, but it has such a boring, straightforward plot that it really wasn't all that great.5/10 PS- I did like the TCM reference near the end.",5,0,0,21 June 2006
Oldboy," Incredible
","A man is kidnapped and locked away, without any idea why or for how long. 15 years later he is released, and vows to find his captors have his revenge. Sounds like a pretty basic plot, right? You couldn't be more wrong.I was really surprised by Oldboy. I'd read plenty of reviews calling it a masterpiece, an instant classic, the 'best movie ever', etc., but I never imagined that I really would be this good. The actors are great, especially Min-sik Choi as the main character.There really isn't much else to say about the film. One of the best movies I've seen in a very long time.9.5/10",9,15,90,23 June 2006
Dead Poets Society," Better than most school films
","As with many High School English classes, we had to watch this over the past few days. Unlike most 'school' movies, however, I quite enjoyed it. Robin Williams was great as usual, a pleasant change from his typical over-the-top comedy roles. He is one of my favourite actors, as he can play so many types of roles so perfectly. The supporting cast was great as well, each having their own moments to shine. The film had a very good message, to always stand up for what you believe in, and to seize the day, Carpe Diem! Part of the ending bothered me, to avoid spoilers I wont go into why, though the final scene certainly made up for it. Overall, I was pretty surprised with this movie. Who knew they'd actually make us watch something good in school!7/10",7,0,0,12 March 2006
Capote," Deserved it's Oscar
","Ill get the bad of this film out of the way first. The fact that Bennett Miller is new to directing really shows; most scenes seem to be cut off early, and there is no flow between scenes. He by no means deserves the Oscar nomination, as far as I'm concerned. Also, in some parts near the first and, less frequently throughout the film, the script seemed forced. Capote's line about being 'pegged' would have fit perfectly later in the movie, but was totally out of place when it was said. Now lets move on to the good stuff, shall we? Though the praise is directed almost solely toward Hoffman, I think the entire cast deserves a round of applause and a pat on the back. Hoffman put in a great performance that he deservedly won the Oscar for, hindered only by some fairly weak sections of the script. In my humble opinion however, Cliffton Collins Jr. was the best supporting actor involved by a long shot. I don't think I blinked once during his monologue near the end; his tone and expression...wow. I don't think this film deserves any of the Oscars it was nominated for aside from Best Actor, however Collins certainly should have got a nod for Supporting Actor. His performance seriously blew me away almost as much as Hoffman's. Overall, this is a great movie. Starts out slow, but from the introduction of Perry Smith onward, you wont want to miss a second.8/10",8,1,3,12 March 2006
Corpse Bride," Below-average for Burton, but still enjoyable
","Being a big fan of Burton, I've been looking forward to seeing this one for quite awhile. To be honest it was a bit disappointing, but still a good film. First off, I love Burton's style. Thought it was interesting how the world of the living was dark and drab, while the world of the dead was brightly coloured. Great contrast. The songs weren't bad, but very derivative of much of Elfman's older work, not only Nightmare Before Christmas. The plot was pretty interesting though, and there were quite a few funny parts, so it wasn't all bad. Overall this is a decent Burton flick, but doesn't even compare to Nightmare Before Christmas, which isn't one of his best films in the first place.7/10",7,0,0,24 March 2006
The Thing," Carpenter's Masterpiece
","I've watched this many times in the past, but this is the first time I really realized what a masterpiece it is. This is easily one of the greatest horror films of all time, bar none. Everything about this movie comes together perfectly, not a single minute seems out of place. Everyone praises the gore and special effects, which certainly are amazing, however I think the real highlight of the film is the characters. Though it does get confusing at first with so many characters, it's worth it. They all bring a unique personality to the film, they all give it that extra dimension that so many horror films lack. MacReady, played by Kurt Russel, was amazing, one of the all-time great horror heroes. Just when you think the film can't get any better, Joh Carpenter gives us one of the coolest endings that I've ever seen. I wont spoil it in case any of you haven't seen it yet, but I love how open ended it is. This film is a perfect example of John Carpenter's genius as a filmmaker, contrary to some of his recent work. I find giving a film a perfect score looks bad, but this is one of few that deserves every point I can give it.10/10",10,0,1,17 March 2006
Over the Hedge," Well animated, great voice work, fun characters and a half-decent plot...what more could you want?
","Call me childish, call me immature, do as you wish, but I really enjoyed this movie. It's cute, it's funny, it's just plain enjoyable all around.The plot is nothing new really, basically just a dummed down gangster type plot. A raccoon named RJ (voiced by Bruce Willis) is caught trying to steal food from a bear (Nick Nolte), and is given a week to replace it or else the bear will eat him. He comes across a family of woodland creatures, and tricks them into helping him. Needless to say, the obligatory guilt trip soon follows as they welcome him as one of their own. It's nothing we haven't seen before, but kept my interest and had some pretty fun plot devices, mostly near the end. The only thing that could have been better about the plot was that it wasn't very fleshed out, everything seemed to happen all at once.The actors were all a lot of fun, and the voice work was great. William Shartner does a great job making fun of himself, playing a completely over the top possum. Willis also did a very good job as the raccoon, as did Garry Shandling as Verne the turtle. But, as the previews would lead you to believe, it's Steve Carell that really steals the show. His manic, insane, hyper-active squirrel, Hammy, was easily my favourite character. Sure, some of his jokes might have been a tad immature (Wanna help me find my nuts?), but I still found myself laughing at every perfectly delivered line he said.I don't know what else to say other than that this movie is a lot of fun. Well animated, great voice work, fun characters and a half-decent plot...what more could you want? 8/10",8,10,12,3 June 2006
Dark City," One of the greatest sci-fi films of all time
","I don't really want to say a lot about this movie for fear of spoiling anything, so I'll keep this short and sweet.First off: The plot is incredible. If you thought The Matrix was thought provoking, this will blow your mind.The cinematography and overall design of this film are also incredible. Very dark, very surreal. Along with the spectacular effects, the whole movie looks great.The actors are all very good as well, especially Keifer Sutherland.Put simply, you have to see this movie. One of the best sci-fi films I've ever seen.9/10",9,0,2,20 June 2006
The Exorcist," Good, but overrated. Read the book instead.
","Maybe it's because I didn't see it in theatres. Perhaps it's because of my age. It might even be because I had overly high expectations after reading the book. Whatever the reason may be, the fact is I don't think that this film is nearly as good as it's reputation would tell you. It is certainly a well-made film, all the actors involved are great, the effects aren't bad, and Friedkin directs the film superbly. I especially enjoyed the hidden 'faces' that show up in numerous scenes. Is it scary? Not as far as I'm concerned it isn't. Perhaps a devout Catholic would think differently, but I wasn't frightened in the least. I don't believe in these occurrences, and that takes away any scare factor that there may have been, unless you're afraid of projectile vomit. Though the actors work well with what they have, the characters are all very flat. Very few of them are fleshed out, which is a shame. For a much better experience, read the book. The characters are all more fleshed out, more occurrences are explained, and it still leaves room for your beliefs.5.5/10",6,2,6,13 March 2006
X-Men: The Last Stand," Great addition to a great franchise
","Do not worry, this is a 100% spoiler free review...which is much harder than you'd think.I'm a big fan of the X-Men in their various incarnations, be it the various cartoons, video games, comic books or, obviously, films. Though this doesn't quite live up to the first film, I think it easily surpasses #2, and I'm completely baffled by the people who've been saying it's the worst in the series.I'll admit that I was a bit worried at first. The opening seemed really forced and the actors didn't seem as enthusiastic as they have been in the past films. However my mind was quickly changed after a huge shocker right off the bat. As promised , this review is spoiler free...but wow. Those of you who've seen the movie know what I'm talking about.As I mentioned, the actors didn't seem as into their parts as they were in the previous installments. Once the film got on track however, this was mostly rectified. The only problem character-wise that lasted throughout the film was Wolverine. Until now, Hugh Jackman seemed born to play the role, and he pulled it off perfectly in the first two. Always on edge, blunt, sarcastic and almost feral. Here however, he seems much to sensitive. Perhaps this is more to blame on the writing, I suppose, but one scene in particular stands out that was totally out of character for him. Once again, spoiler free. Famke Janssen was dead-on as Phoenix, and made the character very cool.The plot was handled great. I was a little afraid that a plot about a cure for 'mutancy' would turn into a preachy mess, and although it does start out that way a balance is quickly found. The ending is pretty awesome as well, but if you don't want to groan Id avoid the scene after the credits.The effects were incredible, as can be expected from any film with this kind of budget. Everyone bad mouths CGI, but damn does it look awesome when used well.The new characters were great for the most part. I really liked the major characters of Magneto's Brotherhood: Juggernaut, Calisto and Spyke being the stand out new members. Pyro was as cool as ever, though I'd like to have seen a bit more of him. I was a little disappointed in the lack of an Omega Red cameo...there were rumors going around, but no luck.After it's all said and done, this is a great addition to a great series. It cant live up to #1, but it easily beats out X-2.8.5/10",8,1,2,31 May 2006
Back to the Future Part III," Weakest entry in the series, but still very good
","This was a great way to close off a classic trilogy. Though it obviously wasn't on par with the first, I think was was almost as enjoyable as Part 2. The plot was much less complicated, which is both a good thing and a bad thing. It's a good thing because it's much easier to wrap your head around, however it shows that the writers were more concerned with finishing the series than making another classic. The majority of the cast reprise their roles, and are all as great as ever. The Clara character was kind of annoying, but I can forgive that because she was important to the plot. I liked the ending, great way to end the series. Last but not least, what western fan such as myself wouldn't love the Good, Bad and the Ugly reference! Overall this was a fitting end to a great trilogy. Probably the weakest of the three, but that's definitely not a bad thing.7.5/10",7,0,0,9 April 2006
"Good Night, and Good Luck."," Great acting and beautiful cinematography
","When I watch a film, I often watch it more than just to be entertained. I like to learn from film as well, and this fulfills both needs very well. Perhaps it loses some of it's entertainment factor by staying so close to the source material, however that doesn't detract too much. For one such as myself with very little prior knowledge of the subject matter, the film is rather confusing at first. After the first half hour or so though, the plot sucks you in and you wont want to blink. Strathairn skillfully heads up a wholly incredible cast, backed up by such strong supporting actors as Ray Wise, Frank Langella, and even director George Clooney himself. Though Clooney is great on both sides of the camera, in this film he really shines behind it. The beautiful cinematography blew me away, though I am a sucker for back and white. Overall, this film does drag in parts but is completely worth it. Should have one at least one or two Oscars.7.5/10",7,1,2,31 March 2006
Saw II," Great moder day horror film that deserves multiple viewings
","This review contains clearly marked spoilers.This is a film that, upon second viewing, found me thinking 'You moron' quite frequently. Definitely still a good film, but 2-3 characters in particular are incredibly stupid. The acting, script, effects, and twists, for the most part, are improved upon from the original, however they still aren't that great. Aside from the twists of course, which I found pretty amusing.8/10One problem I had with it though: *HUGE SPOILERS* Perhaps this was intentional, but Xavier didn't have a frigging number on his neck!! You couldn't really see if he did or not when he ripped the chunk off his neck, but earlier on in the film we had a clear shot of the back of his head/neck....and NO NUMBER. This may have been intentional, but I'm thinking it was an error on the part of the filmmakers.*END SPOILERS*",8,0,0,12 March 2006
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory," Very good film, incomparable to the original
","This is the second time I've seen this movie, and I enjoyed it just as much as my first viewing. I wont say if I thought it was better or worse than the original, as it was an entirely different movie, and largely incomparable to the 1971 film. Depp was great as always, his Wonka was so crazy that it was almost scary in some parts. The supporting cast was great as well, including many Burton regulars such as Helena Bonham Carter, and Deep Roy as the bizarre new Oomp-Loompas. Christopher Lee makes a nice appearance as Wonka's dentist father. Lee never disappoints, and while his part is rather small, it is one of the highlights of the movie in my opinion. Very good movie with phenomenal effects, if you haven't seen it yet, go rent yourself a copy.8/10",8,0,1,12 March 2006
Saw," Don't think too hard
","The more times I see this film, the less I enjoy it. The first time I saw it I was blown away at how perfectly everything fits together, but now after around my fifth viewing, that is the main thing that bothers me about it: Everything fits together TOO perfectly. If the characters had done a single thing differently, the whole plan wouldn't have worked. The movie is still fun to watch and everything, but it really doesn't make a lot of sense. The cop played by Danny Glover is easily the best part of the movie, especially near the end. Though I wouldn't say the actors are as bad as reputation dictates, Glover puts everyone else to shame. Overall, this isn't a bad movie, just don't think about it too much. Too many ways that the plot could and should have gone wrong. The first time I saw it I would have given it very high mark, but now I'd only give it around:6.5/10",6,0,0,7 May 2006
From Hell," Not bad at all
","This was a pretty good show. Depp is one of my favourite actors, and while this wasn't one of his best roles, he still did a great job as Abberline. I also quire liked Robbie Coltrane as his partner with an affection for poetry, Peter Godrey. The rest of the supporting cast was good as well, especially Ian Holm. I loved the atmosphere; though I've heard people complain about it's inaccuracies, I love this romantic kind of portrayal of London: the cobblestone streets, the faint street lights through the billowing fog...makes a great setting for a horror flick. One small problem I had was that the plot seemed to move too fast. There wasn't really enough time for anything to develop, especially near the end. Overall it was a pretty good movie though, I enjoyed it.7/10",7,2,3,26 March 2006
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," It's been said, but this is the best Potter film yet.
","*There are some clearly marked spoilers near the end of this, in case anyone cares* First off, I should say that I'm only a borderline Potter fan. I still haven't got around to reading the sixth book, but I've read the rest. On top of that, what kind of Potter fan waits until this has been out on DVD for a month to see it? Exactly. I enjoyed the 3rd one, but it didn't exactly leave me excited to watch this. I was actually quite surprised; not only was it better than #3, Id even go so far as to call it the best of the lot! Mike Newell continued the dark atmosphere that Alfonso CuarÃ³n introduced in the third movie, which was a rather nice touch. I've said it before and Ill say it again however, Daniel Radcliffe isn't a great actor. He's not terrible or anything, but he is dwarfed in comparison to his very talented co-stars. Emma Watson in particular, Id really like to see her in something other than the Potter saga. Surprisingly talented young actress. There was a great chemistry between the actors, especially the three leads. The supporting cast was good as well, though the best were very underused. Alan Rickman and Gary Oldman deserved to be in this much longer than they were. Both are great actors who play great characters in the saga, and they were each on screen for a total of about 5 minutes. Ralph Finnes was great as Voldemort, very creepy and well done. The effects were great every step of the way. To sum up this rambling review, I throughly enjoyed it.*Spoilers* The one big problem that I had with it was the lack of character development on Cedric. In the book, his death was a very upsetting and powerful event, though in the film he wasn't a character that they made you care about. He was just sort of...there. That didn't ruin the film, but it definitely detracted some points...*End Spoiler* 8/10",8,1,2,25 March 2006
Army of Darkness," Silly but lots of fun!
","Being a huge fan of the Evil Dead franchise, and a huge Bruce Campbell fan in general, I knew I was going to enjoy this. It totally abandons the horror aspect of the first 2, but is still A lot of fun.The plot is completely off-the-wall, and I loved it. It picks up where ED2 leaves off, with Ash transported to the Middle Ages. He has to find the Necronomicon in order to return to his own time, but inadvertently unleashes Hell upon the world...literally. Great plot, kept me absorbed and enthralled from beginning to end.Ash has got to be one of the greatest characters ever put on film. He really comes into his own in this one, spouting more one-liners than ever. Bruce Campbell is a very underrated actor who really deserves more recognition. The rest of the cast are pretty good as well.Though it's nothing like it's predecessors, this is a great film. Sure it's kind of silly, but it knows what it is and has fun with it.'Hail to the king, baby' 8/10",8,2,4,23 June 2006
The Shawshank Redemption," A bit overrated, but still an amazing film
","It's times like these that almost tempt me to grab Jigsaw off the shelf. It's been almost a month since I saw a film that was flatout bad; the worst review I've given in weeks was a 6/10 to Flightplan. This film obviously didn't break my streak.I went into it knowing next to nothing, only that IMDb has it ranked as the second best movie of all time, that it was based on a story by Stephen King, and that it took place in a prison. Needless to say, it blew me away. I wont say a thing about the plot, just so that others who've yet to see this film have a chance at the same experience as me. I will say this though: It has some of the most subtle and unexpected twists you will ever see. One in particular stands out above the rest.Not much can be said about the actors that hasn't been said. Morgan Freeman gives one of the best performances of his career, and even though I've only seen 2 or 3 other Tim Robbins movies, I'm sure the same can be said for him.Though I don't agree with the multitudes of people that call this the best movie ever made, it was still a very good, very well made, very entertaining and almost heartbreaking film.9/10",9,19,35,21 May 2006
Scream," A little too smug, but enjoyable
","*Huge Spoilers* I'm probably the last horror fan on Earth to see this movie, and I'll admit was wasn't expecting much. Amazingly enough, it was worth the wait! As I expected, the smug attitude was really annoying, but not as bad as I expected. Another thing I didn't like was the supermarket scene. How stupid can it get? Dressed up like that in a supermarket, the day after a double murder. Nobody's going to notice that (heavy sarcasm). I though the ending was really cool though. I had the twist partially figured out, but I really didn't think it was Billy. I did figure there was more than one killer, but I fell for the obvious red-herring of Randy...I guess I just underestimated Craven, didn't think he'd twist it too much. The deaths were great, I especially liked Tatum's death, though the scene leading up to it was pretty stupid. Overall, this was surprisingly good, though Craven's smugness does get pretty bothersome.8/10",8,1,1,8 April 2006
Back to the Future Part II," Worthy sequel to all-time classic
","Though not as good as #1 by any means, this is definitely a worthwhile sequel. Fox and Lloyd both reprise their characters, and do just as good a job as in the first. Biff is without a doubt one of the most easily hated film characters of all time, and he's worse than ever this time around. The plot is ingeniously complex, though that makes it hard to follow at times. I love how it ties in with Part 1 so incredibly well, the writers did a great job. Zemeckis's directing was pretty cool in some parts as well. Overall, this is a pretty good sequel to an all-time classic. If you liked the first one, you'll probably like this one too.8/10",8,1,2,9 April 2006
Tombstone," Easily the best film I've seen in a month
","A public service announcement to anyone that hasn't seen this movie: Watch it now! I just saw it for the first time, and it's easily the best movie I've seen in months.I've said it before and I'll say it again, but, in my opinion, characters are likely the most important aspect of a film. That said, the characters here couldn't be better, each one has their own distinct personality, they all have moments to shine and, most importantly, they are all superbly acted. Top honours in that category go, of course, to Val Kilmer as Doc Holiday. Simply one of the best characters ever to grace the screen, no more needs to be said. Kurt Russell also did a very good job as celebrated lawman Wyatt Earp. The supporting cast are great as well, but these two certainly stand out...especially Kilmer.I wont get in to how great the plot is so that I don't spoil it. I'll just leave it at this: it's an enthralling story that will keep you glued from beginning to end, surprise you at times, and even saves time to make you laugh. Very well written, very well played out. Even the music is great, which is something that I often overlook.In conclusion, I'm a huge western fan. In fact, next to horror, I'd have to say they are my favourite genre of film. Despite being fairly recent, this film ranks among the best and has certainly earned it's spot as one of my favourite films.9/10",9,9,14,19 May 2006
Rear Window," More of Hitch's genius
","I've been trying to brush up on my Hitchcock lately, and this here is another classic from the master.First off, Hitchcock really shows his genius as director in how the film is presented. Almost solely from the view of a wheelchair bound Jimmy Stewart, we watch the lives of the various characters unfold before his eyes.Hitch plays with morality here, which I think was another high point of the film. Stewart's speech about ethics really emphasizes this point.The acting is great, but with star power like this, that goes without saying. Grace Kelly is simply stunning, Stewart plays the everyman to perfection, Thelma Ritter is great comic relief, and the various residents of the apartments were great as well.The plot is pretty straight-forward, but very well-written nonetheless. Great tension, lots of laughs, a cool ending...awesome. It did go on more than necessary in some places, but nothing major.Put simply this is a great film, I really enjoyed it.8/10",8,0,1,1 June 2006
Donnie Darko," Thought provoking, thought not hard to figure out
","First off, I should say that I'm not sure if I watched the Director's Cut or the original version. I downloaded it not long ago, and the file didn't specify which version it was. Anyway, on with the review. I really didn't know what to expect from this movie, having heard many different opinions over the last little while. After watching it, I'm still not sure what I thought of it. While I didn't like his character very much, it's hard to deny that Jake Gyllenhaal gave a very good performance as the title character. Something about him just seemed out of place and strange, which suited the character well. I don't think there was a single likable character in this film, except maybe Donnies girlfriend. I don't see what everyone finds so hard to get about the ending, I thought it was a good ending, don't get me wrong, but pretty straight forward. Overall, I'd recommend seeing this one, but I wouldn't buy it. More of a curiosity than anything.8/10 PS - I did think that it was a nice touch casting real-life siblings Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal as siblings in the film.",8,2,5,11 March 2006

","How do you review one of the best, most famous comedies of all time? What is there that hasn't already been said? I suppose I could comment on how amazingly well-written the plot is, how everything fits together perfectly and keeps you on the edge of your seat. Or, I could mention how hilarious it is; the subtle jokes like Lone Pine Mall, the absurdity of some of the characters, the expression on Crispin Glover's face. Perhaps I could say how incredible the effects are, and say how great it is that they still hold up today. After that, I could say something about how these are the characters that Micheal J. Fox and Christopher Lloyd will always be remembered for. That would link in to the fun 80's soundtrack. Then I could end the review by saying how much I love the ending, how it almost makes you want to grab the sequel of the shelf right away. Oh well, I guess it's all been said before...9/10",9,1,2,8 April 2006
Hustle & Flow," Well acted, but typical hip-hop movie
","Well, I'm not really sure what I thought of this one. Normally, this is the kind of movie I wouldn't even look twice at on the shelf in Blockbuster, but I'm trying to take in as many Oscar nominated films as I can this year. Like I said, I'm not totally sure what I thought about it. Terrence Howard doesn't by any means deserve the Oscar, but he definitely earned the nomination. Very well acted on everyone's part, actually. However, many scenes were pretty uneven in parts. For example, the scene near the end where he was talking with Key. At first, it was a pretty tense scene, Key seemed pretty upset and almost hurt. But after the little flashback with Nola, they were both happy as a clam. That kind of thing happened a lot, but that's the best example. There was also a bit of unfinished business with certain characters. Lexus just disappeared about half way through, and while she wasn't a great character anyway, it would have been nice to know what happened to her. Overall, it was a well made, well acted movie, but if you normally wouldn't be interested in this type of flick, don't bother with it.6/10",6,1,3,12 March 2006
Beetlejuice," One of Burton's best
","Considering I'm a huge fan of Tim Burton, I knew Id like this before I even popped it in the DVD player. I don't really know why I put off seeing it for so long, but I'm glad I finally got around to it! The whole film has that great Burton style that we all know and love, only perhaps a touch more macabre than usual. Keaton completely steals the show in a relatively small role as the title character, a rude, crude, self-proclaimed 'Bio-Exorcist'. The effects are amazing, the various hauntings looked great! Baldwin and Davis both did great in their roles, especially near the end. All the creatures and characters from the afterlife were very cool. My only gripe with this movie is how long they waited to introduce the title character. Not a huge problem, but I would have liked to see more of Keaton. Overall if you're a fan of Burton don't go any longer without seeing this movie! 8.5/10",8,1,2,8 April 2006
