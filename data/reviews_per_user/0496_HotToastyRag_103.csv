The Devil's Advocate," A total '90s classic
","The classic, commonly used phrase is given an entirely new meaning when lawyer Keanu Reeves joins an important law firm headed by the charming, persuasive Al Pacino. Things are simultaneously too good to be true and frighteningly ominous, and before long, we learn why: Al is Satan-or, as he says in his famous, hilarious monologue, 'Call me Dad.'If you like these types of movies that border on horror, but aren't too scary for the faint of heart, this one's a classic. I only hid my eyes a couple of times, during Charlize Theron's demonic hallucinations, so everyone else out there should be fine. For a perfectly devilish Halloween marathon, rent both The Devil's Advocate and The Devil and Daniel Webster. Both are just scary enough so that you go to bed with the willies but aren't given nightmares, both star very handsome men playing the Devil, and Al Pacino cited Walter Huston's performance as his inspiration for the role. It just doesn't work when the Devil isn't played by a handsome, alluring man, does it? So, Al-and Walter, fifty-five years earlier-was perfectly cast. He's very magnetic and persuasive, so it's no wonder the weak-willed Keanu falls under his spell. The Devil's Advocate is so deliciously '90s. Check it out if you've somehow gone this long without seeing it.",7,0,1,27 January 2019
Scarface," Impossible to dislike
","After you've seen the remake of Scarface, you can completely understand why the original has escaped everyone's memory, even though it propelled a brand-new actor into instant stardom in 1932. You can also completely understand why Al Pacino sealed his fate to forever play bad guys. Even during the rare instances where he wasn't cast as the bad guy, his character was still given an edge or a shady past. After playing Michael Corleone and Tony Montana, it's just impossible to play a completely good guy.If you can stomach the violence, you have to watch this movie. It's one of those modern classics that gives you goosebumps during the first scene, since it's so clear you're watching movie magic. Obviously, if intense and frequent violence upsets you, you have my full understanding. Stick to your non-violent guns and never let anyone pressure you into seeing this movie. This is a man's movie, with a completely masculine protagonist who rises to the top of the crime world through drugs, violence, a raging temper, and a penchant for beautiful women. It also has one of the most memorable shootouts in screen history. When Al Pacino says, 'Say hello to my little friend!' he's not inviting Michelle Pfeiffer into his bedroom. Ladies, you're much better off renting Frankie and Johnny.Fellas, you're going to find yourself a new favorite movie the first time you rent Scarface. I had countless friends in college who cited this movie as one of their all-time favorites, even the pretentious guys who valued art above all else. It's such a classic that it's impossible to dislike, even if you hate it. My mom, who is very much a lady and doesn't like violence, has repeatedly praised the effort of the film and Al Pacino's wonderful performance. See what I mean? It's just impossible not to appreciate this Cuban extension of The Godfather, with a flawless performance by the ultimate gangster.I used to have 'movie star parties' when I was in school, and the lucky youngster who got to play Al Pacino enjoyed reciting his lines so much, and we all loved seeing him recreate the 'say goodnight to the bad guy' speech that was so memorable from Scarface. There's so much from the movie that you'll remember, from the bottomless piles of cocaine, to the borderline incestuous relationship between Al and his sister Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, to Al's endlessly mimicable accent, to Michelle Pfeiffer's beauty that's so exquisite, you think you might go blind if you look at her for too long.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic violence, nudity, drug use, and language, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",7,0,1,29 January 2019
Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," Mediocre sequel
","Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law return as Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson in the sequel Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows. While I still maintain that the films would have been more enjoyable if the casting were reversed, the way each character is written is cemented even further in this second installment. Robert Downey Jr. is the eccentric detective, and Jude Law is the boring, superfluous straight man who's consistently annoyed by his partner's antics. The setting for this film is Jude Law's wedding to Kelly Reilly. In the art of storytelling, when a character is married the audience is usually supposed to see that his or her journey is complete and their usefulness to the plot is over. So, Jude Law's character is viewed as even more boring and superfluous!As Jude and Kelly are supposed to be enjoying their honeymoon, the famed villain Moriarty, played by Jared Harris, attacks, leaving Bob to save the day, and leaving Jude to continuously complain that he'd rather be enjoying his wife than fighting bad guys. Still, if you liked the first film, Sherlock Holmes, you'll probably like the sequel. The action-comedies are pretty similar, and director Guy Ritchie returns with his slow-motion action scenes. These aren't my favorite Sherlock Holmes films, but they're not terrible either. I just would have preferred Jude Law as the lead.",4,2,6,13 December 2017
The Expendables 2," Perfect for a weekend matinee
","Imagine all the greatest action stars put into one epic action movie. If you thought that idea sounds cool, you've probably seen The Expendables. If you liked it, you'll probably want to watch The Expendables 2. The original cast of Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Bruce Willis, Dolph Lundgren, and Randy Couture continue on, with a couple of new faces: Chuck Norris and Jean-Claude Van Damme. With those added action heroes, how can the movie be bad? It's not.With just as much action and edge-of-your-seat scenes as the first one, but with much more humor, The Expendables 2 is a guaranteed good time if you're looking for something to rent for this weekend's matinee. I'm not even the target audience for this franchise, but I enjoyed this one quite a bit. Obviously, guys will love it, but even the girliest of girls might still have a good time. And when you're done, you can check out The Expendables 3, with Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Wesley Snipes, and Antonio Banderas added into the action hero list!",7,0,0,25 June 2019
Spartacus," Very famous classic
","Just as Ben-Hur is the most famous biblical movie ever, Spartacus is the most famous gladiator movie ever. (Sorry, Russell Crowe.) In 1960, the year after Ben-Hur's spectacular success, producing a three-hour movie about Roman gladiators was risky. Everyone in the audience would be comparing it to Charlton Heston's slavery scenes, so it'd better be good! Well, whether or not you like it, it's remained a classic through the decades.Spartacus focuses on the treatment and life of slaves, and the dissension within the Roman Empire, rather than copying any Biblical theme from the countless religious movies to come out of the 1950s. There are so many famous scenes and lines that have come out of this movie, it's almost superfluous to give a plot summary or even mention the cast. Briefly, Kirk Douglas plays the title character, an unruly slave who is sent to train as a gladiator. He falls in love with Jean Simmons, and while his fellow slaves turn to him as a leader, he bonds closely with one in particular, Tony Curtis. Laurence Olivier, Charles Laughton, Peter Ustinov, and John Gavin give very memorable performances as a Roman politician, a slave trader, and Julius Caesar, respectively.If this is one of the first old movies you've ever seen, you'll form very definite opinions of everyone in the cast that will be hard to shake no matter how many more of their movies you subsequently watch. You'll find it hard to believe Laurence Olivier was once a handsome hero after you see him as such a convincing villain. You won't find Charles Laughton very endearing, and you'll probably wonder why Peter Ustinov won the Oscar for Supporting Actor. Ustinov's character is important to the story, but it's not a very demanding performance, and I have to think this was a long overdue make-up Oscar for his turn in Quo Vadis. It's also puzzling when you find out Kirk Douglas wasn't even nominated, but Alex North's absurd music was. I understand North wanted to conjure the 'Roman circus' idea in people's minds, but once he heard what he wrote and realized it wasn't working, he should have come up with something else. It's hard to take a movie, let alone a huge epic, seriously when the music is comical and ill-fitting.Kirk Douglas pulled out all the stops in his most famous film, and when you see him performing his gladiator training stunts, you'll drop your jaw-and not only because he looks so good. There are rigorous physical scenes that had to be performed take after take without tiring, but there are also tender moments that prove he's 'not an animal,' a phrase he keeps repeating to his captors. When he falls in love with Jean Simmons, they're repeatedly kept apart as another torture tactic. In one horrible scene, she's thrown into a neighboring prison cell with a gruff brute so Kirk can hear what happens to her and realize he's helpless to stop it. The next morning, he sneaks a private moment with her during breakfast to ask if she's alright. Keep in mind this movie was made in 1960 after the fall of the Production Code. Scenes with implied rape were allowed, as were partial nudity and sexual innuendo.Spartacus is one of those classics, like Gone with the Wind, that everyone sees at least once in their lifetime. If you have no idea what the phrase 'I'm Spartacus!' means, your film education missed a key course. Go rent the movie during your next guys' weekend, and get ready to appreciate the movie that fathered all the modern gladiator movies we know and love.",7,1,1,25 July 2017
Lifeboat," Great direction from Hitchcock
","I'm the first to admit I don't like Alfred Hitchcock's movies in general, but Lifeboat is a good one. It's a gamble to make an entire movie about a handful of people stuck in a lifeboat together, with no flashbacks or change of scenery, but Hitchcock makes sure not a moment lags. He keeps up the pace, and uses interesting framing to draw the audience's attention to what he wants them to notice. At the start of the movie, he manages to keep every single person in the frame, showing they're sharing the same feelings. As tensions rise and certain people start pulling away from each other, they're separated into different frames.In one great scene, everyone's suspicious of the newcomer in the boat, Walter Slezak. Hitchcock shows the other eight congregating on one side of the boat, chatting away. Tallulah Bankhead is given a closeup as she focuses on herself and the loss of her typewriter. Throughout the dialogue, the camera cuts back to Walter, in the same frame with only the man guarding him. Walter inches closer, checking to see no one will notice, so that he might overtake the guard.Lifeboat is a perfect example of human nature. We've all seen it happen, greed, self-preservation, and stupidity coming to the forefront when human lives are at stake. Taking eight strangers and sticking them in a boat with little hope of rescue will bring out the worst in everyone. How will it unfold? You'll have to watch this entertaining movie (starring Tallulah Bankhead, Henry Hull, John Hodiak, Hume Cronyn, Walter Slezak, Mary Anderson, Heather Angel, Canada Lee, and William Bendix)to find out. If you get seasick, though, you might not be able to watch it. Since the dialogue is so riveting, I'd suggest watching it with a buddy, like my mom did. Put your back to the television and listen to what's going on, then ask your pal to tell you if there's a visual you've missed.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend.The entire movie is filmed on the ocean, so there are constant bobbings that will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",7,0,0,25 June 2020
To Be or Not to Be," An excellent dark comedy
","To Be or Not to Be is one of those great classics that can make a fan of old movies from someone who would never normally want to watch one. My brother and sister-in-law are two examples; he'll only watch something in black-and-white if forced to, and she'll fall asleep in ten minutes during any movie that doesn't star Benedict Cumberbatch. Both of them loved this movie for the simple reason that it's fantastic.You may have seen the Mel Brooks remake, but I prefer this version because it was made during the time that no one knew who was going to win the war and everyone was terrified. There's an added sense of fear and desperation in wartime movies that's absent from any other movie made after 1945. In this dark comedy, a Polish theater troupe get in over their heads after the Gestapo take over their country. Everyone in the film is frightened, and everyone who watched it at the time was frightened. And, adding a terribly tragic tone to the finished product, Carole Lombard died one month before the film's release. It's a very unique feeling to watch an actress risking her life for her country in a movie when that's exactly what she did in real life.Carole and her egotistical husband Jack Benny are the stars of a theater troupe, and when she has an affair with a young flyer, Robert Stack, their lives catapult from the stage to the warfront. Robert is involved in the Polish rebellion, and when a Nazi spy infiltrates his mission, Carole is enlisted to help save her people before the spy hands over a list of names to the Gestapo. The story itself is extremely dark and frightening, but Edwin Justus Mayer's screenplay is so clever and fast-paced, you'll find yourself laughing while you're tensely on the edge of your seat. I won't tell you what happens because it's so much fun to see it all play out, with surprises around every corner.Carole's comic timing is its usual best, and Ernst Lubitsch balances the line between comedy and drama in every scene. In the supporting cast are Sig Ruman as an incompetent Nazi Colonel who continually shifts the blame to others, Charles Halton as the theater's producer, Miles Mander, and Halliwell Hobbs. Felix Bressart is Jewish actor in the troupe, and since he was a German refugee to the United States, his lines carry an extra depth of emotion. He delivers Shylock's monologue from The Merchant of Venice three times, each time with a different meaning behind his delivery. This is an excellent film, so even if you're not usually drawn to movies made 80 years ago, give it a chance. I know you'll love it.",10,0,0,1 February 2020
This Is the End," If these friends aren't your friends, you won't like it
","This is one of those movies that you have to watch in a group of friends, preferably when there are lots of distractions around so you'll think it's funnier than it is. I would never have watched this movie on my own, and while the company and party atmosphere helped, it still wasn't my cup of tea. In general, I hate end-of-the-world movies and avoid them like the plague. For the sake of this review, I'll try to be kind and realize that many people out there do like that genre.If you do like that genre, and you like buddy comedies that feature the same group of pals you've seen together in many movies, you might consider renting this one. Everyone plays his or herself in this movie, so it feels much more like the guys filmed themselves at a party rather than a Hollywood film that's been thoroughly thought through. James Franco hosts a party at his house, and his pals Seth Rogen, Jonah Hill, Jay Baruchel, Danny McBride, and Craig Robinson, have a great time until the world starts to end. Tons of people wanted to be in this movie, so you'll see cameos by Michael Cera, Mindy Kaling, Emma Watson, Rihanna, Channing Tatum, Kevin Hart, Paul Rudd, Jason Segel, Martin Starr, Christopher Mintz-Plasse, Aziz Ansari, and the Backstreet Boys.If you don't generally like the movies made by this crop of actors, you probably won't like this one. Most of the enjoyment will probably come from knowing how much fun the actors had making it and improvising what they thought was funny at the time. A good rule of thumb: watch the preview and if you like it, you'll probably like the movie.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and frightening scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",2,1,3,16 February 2020
12 Monkeys," Extremely confusing
","This movie is so weird and confusing, when I watched it with my mom and brother, I kept pressing pause and asking them to explain what was happening. Then, when it was all over and the credits rolled, I still didn't get it! As the years passed, my memory of the unexplained faded, so I have even less of an idea of what it was about than I did back then.Bruce Willis stars in this sci-fi thriller as a man from the future who travels back in time to prevent a disease outbreak in the past. Of course, something goes wrong, and he winds up in a mental institution. He meets Brad Pitt, a literally raving lunatic, and Christopher Plummer and Madeleine Stowe, psychologists at the hospital.From there, my memory grows hazy. There's quite a bit of discussion of time travel, going to the past, the past becoming the present, the present being the future, going crazy, crazy people being sane, truth, and illusion. If you can decipher any of it, you're smarter than I am.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There are some canted angles and swirling camera motions, especially when the spiral staircase is shown, and it make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to adult subject matter, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",2,1,5,8 July 2019
Spider-Man 2," Don't open the caviar!
","The cast of the original franchise-and by that I mean the only acceptable franchise-is so perfect. They could have kept making movie after movie, rather than passing their batons to two new casts in the last ten years. Unfortunately, if you love Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker, Kirsten Dunst as Mary-Jane, James Franco as Harry Osborn, J.K. Simmons as J. Jameson, and Rosemary Harris as Aunt May, you've only got three movies to enjoy them. Still, three movies are better than none, and it's always a fun weekend to break out your boxed set and have a marathon.In this one, Alfred Molina guest stars as the villain Dr. Octopus, and while his acting helps the movie along, his character isn't the most interesting of the villains. Following on the heels of the intriguing Green Goblin, Dr. Octopus would have been a major let-down had it not been for the fantastic special effects. It's not Alfred Molina's fault, and he does the best he can with the character.Peter Parker still has an unrequited crush on Mary-Jane, and in this movie, she's actually engaged to his boss's son, Daniel Gillies. Peter's pal Harry is grieving over his father, so if you want to see the gorgeous face of James Franco pouting in nearly every scene, this will be your favorite of the three. And if you think he's cute in this one, you'll just love the third movie when he gets his smile back. Where was I? Oh yes, the plot. You don't really need one if you're in the middle of the trilogy; you're not going to turn back and leave the series hanging at this point.What I love about comic book movies-the good ones, not the unnecessarily dark ones-is that they always have plenty of comic relief to remind audiences that it's all a fantasy. J.K. Simmons gets to deliver one of the funniest lines: 'Call the caterer. Tell her not to open the caviar.' He's hilarious in this movie, as he tries to turn Spider-Man into a menace through his newspaper. Rosemary Harris gets a meaningful monologue about how important it is to do the right thing even when everyone else is against you, and Elya Baskin makes his presence immortal with one word: 'Rent?'See-who needs plot when you've got memorable moments that make it nearly impossible to choose a favorite of the three movies? The first movie is my favorite because of the introduction to the story. The second one is my favorite because of the incredible scene when Tobey stops a crashing train. The third one is my favorite because James Franco and Kirsten Dunst make an omelet. Call me sentimental.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spider-Man flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",10,0,0,25 February 2020
The Fifth Element," Such an adorable action comedy
","For someone who doesn't normally like science fiction movies, it's pretty funny that one of the movies I was raised on was The Fifth Element. This was such a beloved movie in our household, we frequently quoted one-liners and even named one of our cats after Milla Jovovich's character. Because we couldn't resist the little kitten, even though we hadn't intended to come home with one, and because she had a bit of orange poking through her Abyssinian fur, we thought she was 'the supreme being'. The Fifth Element might not be your favorite action flick, but I'm sure you understand that it's one of mine.In a hilarious, wacky future with flying cars, robot bartenders, clunky guns, and devices that change one's nail polish instantly, Bruce Willis stars as a scruffy, recently fired cab driver who gets drawn into a mission to save the world. On accident, a beautiful, scantily-clad woman falls into his cab, and he helps her escape from the bad guys chasing her. She speaks no English and has no identification, but Bruce quickly learns that Milla is 'the supreme being' destined to save the world. She's so adorable! As he helps her learn English and information about the modern world, they also fall in love. Ian Holm and Chris Tucker join the 'save the world gang', playing a by-the-rules religious figure and an over-the-top gameshow host, respectively. The head bad guy, who's far more hilarious than evil, is Gary Oldman. Every scene of his is memorable, with delightful humor and a quotable line to take with you after the credits roll. Then again, the same can be said for everyone else's scenes; it's just that type of a movie.Much like the plot to save the world, everyone in the cast presents his or her own element, combining to create perfection. If you've never seen this movie, give it a chance. You might not name your cat after it, but you'll certainly be entertained and come away with some new household phrases. 'I don't want an incident!' 'Mul-ti-pass.' 'Think he's gonna be okay?' 'Do-you-want-some-more?' 'Aziz, lights!' 'If you want something done, do it yourself!' If those quotes don't bring a smile to your face, you've either never seen the movie or haven't seen it in a long time. Rent it again!",10,0,1,10 July 2019
127 Hours," Remarkable, thoughtful, and tactful
","You know what this movie is about, and you've heard the hype. Audience members were reportedly vomiting and leaving the theater during opening weekend because of the amputation scene. Very few movies have had such hype, and as I am a notoriously squeamish viewer, I heeded the advice of my brother and his friends who told me not to rent it. Since it's James Franco's week here at Hot Toasty Rag, I knew I had to rent it; how can you celebrate someone's films and ignore the one that garnered him his only Oscar nomination? I was fully prepared to hide behind my hands or my pillow and had both at the ready, but such drastic measures were never taken.The great tragedy of the film, and what makes it hard to watch, is that it's based on a true story. As you watch James Franco drink his own urine and eat his contact lenses, you're constantly reminded that someone else actually did those things. It's similar to All is Lost, a one-person drama about a man stranded in the middle of the ocean on a life raft, but with the difference that 127 Hours is not pure entertainment. It's a horrifying tragedy that makes you want to hug your loved ones very tightly.A movie like this is very tricky to master because the entire audience knows exactly what's going to happen. When we watched James Cameron's Titanic, we were so immersed in the story that even when we saw the iceberg appear, we still thought there was a chance the ship might sail around it. Every scene of 127 Hours is well-timed and well thought out, immersing us so much that even though we know what's going to happen, we're held in incredible suspense as we watch it unfold. In a film focused on an actor pinned down by a rock, the audience could easily get bored, distracted, or taken out of the drama of the scenes. Every scene is riveting and important, and you can hardly stand blinking, let alone getting distracted or looking away. The opening scene shows Franco packing his backpack as he prepares to go on a hike. We know what's going to happen, so we pay attention to his water bottle, Gatorade stash, ropes, flashlight, and of course, his pocketknife. Twice, he's seen reaching blindly on a tall shelf but unable to find his Swiss Army Knife. Filmed from inside the cabinet, the audience cringes and groans as he leaves the knife behind.The final opening title card isn't shown until 16 minutes in, at the immediate moment Franco falls down the crevice and gets pinned in by the boulder. That brief scene is so fantastic, because even though the audience has been waiting for it to happen, when it does, we get the same sinking feeling in the pit of our stomach as Franco. 'It really happened,' we say to ourselves as he tugs and pushes in vain.A self-described 'action movie with a guy who can't move,' 127 Hours rests entirely on James Franco's shoulders. No matter how fast-paced Jon Harris's editing, no matter how thoughtful Danny Boyle's directing, if the lead actor was unconvincing or unlikable, the movie wouldn't have worked. This is not a slice-of-life movie where a character is showcased for a few days and doesn't have to grow or change; this an exposing, grueling, emotional experience. In ninety minutes, he transforms from someone carefree, confident, sexy, and joyful to someone lonely, frightened, and doomed. Franco is seen urinating uncontrollably, saying goodbye to his parents on his camcorder, and flicking ants off his face. He reaches to feel a glimmer of sunshine with his foot with equal realism as when he admits to the camcorder that he knows when he's going to die.During the infamous scene, there was plenty of grunting, pain, struggle, and determination that would make any viewer cry out, 'Give him his Oscar for crying out loud!' but to me, the moment of aftermath was his greatest moment in the entire film. The shock, incredulity, sorrow, regret, fear, and hope of what he's just accomplished all mingle into an indescribable three seconds. I don't know what James Franco pulled from to give that expression on his face, but the result was remarkable.Franco delivered an incredible tour-de-force performance that deserved to win an Academy Award every bit as much as Colin Firth's from The King's Speech. No one but Franco himself knows the depth of his disappointment that night, but hopefully he was a little consoled that he got beaten out by a veteran actor who turned out a great performance. 2010 was not another 1955, thank goodness.Had this movie been made a mere ten years later, I'm sure the amputation scene would have been dragged out and filmed with a far more gruesome mindset. Films have become noticeably bloodier in recent years, and I'm so glad Danny Boyle-who tragically was not even nominated for Best Director-and all involved handled the scene with such tact and care. Trust me; watching this movie will not make you vomit, and you won't need to be carried out of your home theater room in a stretcher. Rent it. You'll love this raw, powerful movie, and you probably won't be able to stop talking about it for weeks afterwards.DLM Warning: : If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. Nearly every single minute of the film is shot either in split-screen, with handheld techniques, sudden movements, or odd perspective. Unfortunately it will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",10,0,0,14 March 2020
The Natural," Classic baseball movie
","Even if you haven't seen it all the way through, or if you saw it so long ago you don't remember it in its entirety, there are parts of The Natural that you'll never forget. In the beginning, when young Robert Redford carves a baseball bat from the lightening-charred wood of a tree, the 'Wonderboy' bat will become engrained in your memory. And I don't know of any moviegoer who doesn't immediately recognize the slow-motion home run with fireworks and Randy Newman's beautiful score in the background.Those two scenes aside, The Natural is a classic baseball movie. Robert Redford rises and falls—and perhaps rises again—as a baseball player in the 1920s and 1930s. Which means this is a perfect 'compromise' movie, as I call it. Men will be satisfied because it's a sports movie, and ladies will get to drool over Robert Redford in period piece outfits.Three women, Barbara Hershey, Glenn Close, and Kim Basinger, are important and different influences in his life. Joining the cast are Robert Duvall as the nosy reporter—are there really any other kind of reporter?—and Wilford Brimley as the team manager. If you haven't seen this 80s classic by now, rent it during the last week of March to get revved up for baseball season. The music is surprisingly beautiful; you'd never guess the same composer wrote the music to Toy Story. And even though he's always handsome in his movies, Robert Redford is particularly gorgeous in this one, so even if you don't like baseball, there's plenty else to fall in love with.",7,1,2,25 September 2017
Just Go with It," Terrible beyond description
","Good God, this was terrible. It was so terrible, I almost have no words. But then again, since you've come to Hot Toasty Rag to read my review, I'll have to come up with something.If you read the plot synopsis, it doesn't seem that bad. A man pretends he's a family man to avoid getting romantic commitments, but when he starts to fall in love, he has to put his money where his mouth is and come up with a family. Then the movie starts. And you soon wish it hadn't.I don't know if Jennifer Aniston signed a terrible contract, or if she just has lousy taste in scripts, but if she doesn't make a good movie after this one, her career might come to a screeching halt. The entire movie feels like Adam Sandler did nothing but repeat the title to his cast before every take, encouraging them to improv the most unfunny, unlikable characters in history. This movie is so terrible, it's an insult to place it among actual palatable films in the category of romantic comedies.I've previously revealed that I'll watch every Jennifer Aniston movie in the world; she is my 'It girl' and my teenage idol. That being said, I didn't make it all the way through this movie. This is the only Jennifer Aniston movie I've ever turned off. That should be a big enough 'Keep Out' sign for you to see.",1,0,0,12 June 2017
The Hustler," Classic Paul Newman
","If Paul Newman wasn't already a star, The Hustler would have made him one overnight. 'Fast' Eddie is a Paul Newman trademark role: smart, quick, sexy, and just as likable as he is bad. Newman has played this character many times, and it never gets old. This time around, he plays a pool hustler who gets himself into trouble by challenging a well-known pool master when he's still small-time.Even if you don't know the rules of pool, The Hustler will hold your hand and explain the rules to you so you don't feel lost by the time the major game sequences start. If you already know and love the game, you'll find yourself in heaven while watching this movie. It's a total classic, full of drama, tension, and a steamy romance that's easy to root for. Paul Newman gives an excellent performance, showing vulnerability in the highs and lows of performance gambling. It's worth it just to watch him, but chances are you'll probably come away liking the entire movie, too!",7,2,2,10 July 2017
Spider-Man 3," Best comic book movie ever
","This installment of the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man movies pulls out all the stops. The original cast returns where they left off, with Peter Parker in a happy relationship with Mary-Jane, and for his grand finale, he has to battle not one, not two, but three comic book villains! Audiences waited patiently during the first two movies for the most popular Spider-Man bad guy to show up: Eddie Brock and his alter-ego Venom finally join the big screen. In addition to Venom, Gwen Stacey, Sandman, and the New Goblin make appearances as well.Thomas Haden Church guest stars and will tug on your heart strings even though he's one of the bad guys. My brother had never seen him in a movie before, and he thought the studio had made an entirely digital character. He really does look like he was peeled off the comic book pages and digitally enhanced to look like a 3-D human actor. It's a fine line to walk when you're trying to personify a comic villain with a sad backstory, and Thomas nails it. You'll be reaching for your Kleenexes and marveling at how Sony Pictures created a digital actor with such lifelike expressions. Just kidding. But if you're expecting the most impressive digital effects of all three movies, you won't be disappointed. Thomas's character literally disintegrates into grains of sand in nearly every scene! How do they do that? How do they get the slimy symbiote to crawl in and infect Topher Grace? The special effects in Spider-Man 3 are truly incredible.This one is the best of the three, and since everyone knows origin stories are usually the best, this one's got to be fantastic to wear the crown. Every plot point moves quickly, and you'll feel as harried and exhausted as Peter Parker by the time it's all over. Topher Grace, who plays Eddie Brock, is given a slightly different backstory than the comic books, but it makes so much sense, it won't bother even the biggest fans. He's a rival photographer at the same newspaper, headed by the hilarious J.K. Simmons, and when he loses his job, his girl, and his respect, he vows to get even. The evil in his heart is quickly joined by Venom, and the rest is history.Those of you who miss Willem Dafoe and believe all other villains to be inferior will be happy that he still makes appearances in later movies through mirrors and memories. Before his son, James Franco, can avenge him, he gets a pretty bad bump on the head and forgets everything. Kirsten Dunst wants to help her old friend, and as she's nursing him back to health, they grow closer. This is the movie and the moment you've been waiting for, folks: the omelet scene. How cute are they? It's such a cute scene, and in a full, entertaining movie with action scenes galore, songs and dances, and everyone's favorite villain dominating the screen, the omelet scene might be my favorite. The 'I'm the other guy' diner scene is close second.With all the drama included in this movie, there has to be quite a bit of comic relief to counteract it and make audiences feel better. Thankfully, there are tons of jokes to keep you laughing. Kirsten Dunst tries her hand at a Broadway musical, but bad reviews write up that her voice can't be heard past the first row. Tobey defends her, insisting he heard her perfectly. 'You were in the first row!' she sighs. There's a proposal looming over their heads, as Tobey borrows his aunt's ring and tries to plan a perfect evening, but it ends in comic disaster. So rest assured, even though this one has some very sad moments-what's a conclusion without some tears?-you'll have plenty of laughs to cushion the blow.Everyone gets his day in the sun in this movie, so no matter who your favorite character is, he or she will get a gem or two as they close out the franchise. If you love Tobey Maguire, he gets to break out of his shell and find out how much fun it is to be the bad guy for a change. If you love Kirsten Dunst, your heart will break for her as she tries to sort out her relationship troubles with her very complicated boyfriend. Rosemary Harris fans will appreciate her wise wisdom, and J.K. Simmons fans will appreciate his secretary Elizabeth Banks's efforts to calm him down. If you like James Franco, you'll fall in love with him all over again in this one; if your tastes run more rugged, you'll root for Thomas Haden Church to get a second chance. You'll even feel sorry for Topher Grace as he's utterly humiliated, and you won't hold any grudges against sweet Bryce Dallas Howard, who innocently causes trouble.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spiderman flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",10,1,1,25 February 2020
A Bridge Too Far," Incredible war epic
","Richard Attenborough's extensive war epic A Bridge Too Far shows the numerous attempts the Allies made to capture German occupied bridges in the Netherlands in WWII. To go into detail about every plot line would be too extensive, but this is a very heavy, dramatic, tense film with lots of featured battles and missions.While other war movies were rewarded with Oscar nominations or wins, this film was completely ignored during the awards season. The direction and production values were impeccable, and with an all-star cast to draw audience appeal, I have no idea why the film wasn't nominated for anything. It's an unforgettable film, with Michael Caine, Robert Redford, Sean Connery, Anthony Hopkins, Laurence Olivier, Dirk Bogarde, Maximilian Schell, Gene Hackman, Ryan O'Neal, Liv Ullmann, Denholm Elliott, and Elliott Gould making up the all-star cast.In particular, Sean Connery's and Robert Redford's performances stand out in my memory. Yes, everyone gives their all in the movie, but the two mentioned actors put a great deal of emotion into scenes where the script didn't give them much to work with. Sean Connery is the man who hears the title line, 'I always felt we tried to go a bridge too far,' spoken, and his reaction is multi-layered and perfect. Robert Redford is given the line, 'Half my men are killed, and you're just gonna stop and drink tea?' which could have sounded corny and awful, but he turns it into something worthy of an Oscar clip.In lots of war movies, there are a couple of lead characters who survive the entire film, and one person who 'buys the farm' and doesn't make it home. A Bridge Too Far isn't the typical war film of earlier decades; it's more similar to Saving Private Ryan or Glory. There are dozens upon dozens of characters, and lots of people die. Be prepared. This is a very tense movie, and sometimes it's difficult to watch. Robert Redford is given a mission to take his men across the water, and the Germans start shooting at them from the bridge they're heading toward. They can't shoot back because they need to use all their strength to keep rowing to safety. Redford and his soldiers start repeating 'Hail Mary, full of Grace' over and over, knowing at any second they could be killed mid-prayer. It's very upsetting to watch, but I wanted to describe it so you know what you're getting into. If you like those types of movies, you'll find a gem in A Bridge Too Far.",6,0,2,30 September 2017
Youth," Horrible 'art film'
","I was so excited to see Youth. Michael Caine had been promoting it all year, claiming it was the movie he was most proud of in his career, and everyone hoped he'd finally nab the Best Actor Oscar. It didn't make it to any of my local movie theaters, but I rented it the first available weekend. Had I sat through it, it would probably be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Thankfully, remotes have a little button called 'fast-forward' so I was only forced to watch about thirty collective minutes.Michael Caine and Harvey Keitel are on vacation in a spa in the Alps. Michael is a retired composer, and Harvey is a film director. They're old friends, and they talk about their work, their families, and getting older. Michael's daughter, Rachel Weisz, shows up because her husband left her, and an aging actress, Jane Fonda, shows up to talk about a role. That's all I was able to get out of the plot. The disjointed scene transitions, strange music choices, minimalistic script, random nude women, and generally confusing storyline ruined the rest of the film. Unless you love 'art films' and have the absolute opposite taste in movies as I do, I would tell you to stay as far away from Youth as possible.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic nudity and confusing content, I wouldn't let my kids watch this movie.",1,3,6,26 September 2017
Milk," Not Sean Penn's finest hour
","A friend of mine told me he saw Milk in the theaters and that Sean Penn's performance was overrated. 'Instead of I Am Sam, it's I Am Gay,' my pal said. Obviously, with that kind of recommendation, I had to see it for myself. I didn't want to be, but I was disappointed with Sean Penn and the movie as a whole. I loved his acceptance speech at the Oscars, but I felt he didn't try as hard as he could have.This biopic of the first openly gay California politician is filmed in an interesting documentary style that blends real footage with scripted scenes. While the hairstyles and fashion of the cast takes you back to the late 1970s, I couldn't help but wish Sean Penn had put as much into this movie as he had I Am Sam. It felt like he was walking through the role and relying on the real Harvey Milk's emotional affect on the audience, rather than letting his talent guide the story. In the supporting cast are political activists Emile Hirsch and Alison Pill, Sean's first boyfriend James Franco, Sean's second boyfriend Diego Luna, the infamous villain Josh Brolin, and Victor Garber as the San Franciscan mayor. Among the supporting actors, there's an incredible amount of passion that the audience can revel in, but all those people pouring their hearts into the sensitive subject serves as a double-edged sword: by comparison, Sean Penn's performance seems even more watered-down.If you like the cast, or if you want to see a biopic of Harvey Milk, of course you're going to want to watch this heavy drama. If you don't end up loving it, you're not the only one.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. Given the documentary style of the film, there are some unexpected zooms and handheld camera, and it will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",3,0,1,23 February 2020
The Prestige," Pretty people in pretty costumes
","As sometimes happens in Hollywood, two films with extremely similar plots are released the same year—Capote and In Cold Blood, Florence Foster Jenkins and The Florence Foster Jenkins Story, The Darkest Hour and Churchill—Christopher Nolan's The Prestige came out the same year as Neil Burger's The Illusionist. If you watch the previews to both, you'll find it nearly impossible to tell apart, since they're both about magicians in 1890s England, both starring dark haired men, women with full lips, and an older mentor gentleman. Both plots seem to dance around someone who will stop at nothing in his quest to find out the truth behind the magic tricks. I've seen both films all the way through, and I still have trouble telling them apart.If you're looking for eye candy to go along with your magician story, The Prestige is the one to rent. Hugh Jackman, in his clean-cut handsomeness, is the star. If you liked him in Kate and Leopold, you'll be very happy to hear he looks almost identical in The Prestige. He and Christian Bale spar off one another, since they both seem to be master illusionists—oh, wait, that's the word from the other film. Anyway, Scarlett Johansson is Hugh's girlfriend and assistant, and Rebecca Hall, David Bowie, Andy Serkis, and Roger Rees join the supporting cast.Christopher Nolan, creator of the slew of Batman remakes, cast two of his favorite actors in this film after working with them in Batman Begins: Christian Bale and Michael Caine. It's really nice to see the actors and actresses working well off each other, which isn't particularly surprising since most of them worked together in various films before. While some of the twists and turns of the plot are entertaining, as is usual with a Christopher Nolan script, as the end credits roll, audiences are able to find some flaws if they choose to think about it. However, if you like Nolan's films, or magic movies, or like to watch pretty people in pretty costumes, rent this one for an entertaining evening.",6,2,4,23 November 2017
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A classic that left a legacy
","Just on the cusp of the 1970s, this movie is a total classic, with some very dated but still fun to watch 70s montage scenes. Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is famous for several reasons, one was the iconic first pairing of real-life friends Paul Newman and Robert Redford. They play off each other beautifully; it's easy to see their true friendship radiating off the screen. Of course, the ending is a famous and often spoofed scene, as is the jumping off the cliff scene.To me, the legacy is the most beautiful aspect of the film. Paul Newman created a children's camp in 1988 for sick kids and their families, named Hole in the Wall Gang Club after the gang in this film. And everyone knows (or should know) Robert Redford founded the Sundance Film Festival in 1978, named after his character in the movie.Obviously, this film touched their hearts. Even if the movie wasn't a classic, it should be watched and respected for what the two men gave back in its name.",7,0,1,10 July 2017
Ocean's Twelve," Just as flashy as the first one
","It's tough to tell whether Ocean's Twelve is a sequel to Ocean's Eleven or a remake. It's so incredibly similar to the first film-which is itself a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack film-that after you've seen both of them, you'll find yourself getting scenes confused with each other. The memorable and expensive cast returns-George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Don Cheadle, Bernie Mac, Casey Affleck, Scott Caan, Carl Reiner, Elliot Gould, Andy Garcia, and Julia Roberts-and are joined by Catherine Zeta-Jones, Eddie Izzard, Robbie Coltrane, and Jared Harris. Once again, they're all involved in a heist that's complicated beyond belief and fraught with plans going awry, but this time, the expensive cast are all flown abroad, enjoying scenes in Italy, France, the Netherlands, and Monaco.If you liked the first one-the remake, not the original-you'll like the sequel. I did not, so I didn't care for the sequel either. Just as the original is a two-hour spectacle of 'Look how cool me and my friends are', the remakes of the Ocean films have the same feel to them. Everyone in the audience knows the actors who take the top billings are friends in real life, and while they have their little smirks and giggles over inside jokes, unfinished sentences, and awkward pauses, the audience either feels 'cool' to be a part of it or wishes they'd just had a get-together without filming it.",2,0,2,16 December 2017
The Bodyguard," Lousy, unless you really love Whitney Houston
","There's really only legitimate reason to watch The Bodyguard: if you're a Whitney Houston fan. And I mean total, complete, number-one fan. Anyone else in the audience will see from the first scene that Whitney is a terrible excuse for an actress, and the plot is as thin as the romance. And, if you don't even like her music, you haven't got a chance at making it through this movie.Whitney's blatty, expressionless voice aside, this isn't a good movie. The love story of an extremely popular singer (gee, I wonder who plays her) and the man who is her bodyguard falls extremely flat. It's boring, there's no chemistry, and there's no sense of danger to even necessitate a bodyguard.So, even though Kevin Costner's a cutie, this is one to skip unless you really, really love Whitney Houston songs.",1,3,8,18 June 2017
The Expendables," Action star heaven
","Imagine all the greatest action stars put into one epic action movie. If Svlvester Stallone, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jason Stathom, Bruce Willis, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Steve Austin are your idea of top heroes, you'll be in action heaven. Okay, they're missing a few, but that's still quite a lot of literal man power in one cast. And with two sequels, they've added a few more to the cast with each installment.There's really no way to go wrong with a movie like this. No matter who your favorite action star is, he's guaranteed nearly equal screen time as the others and he's guaranteed an impressive action scene or two. If you like wrestling, shooting, street fighting, or martial arts, you'll be a happy camper. No matter your age, if you're a teenager and like to see guys who are the same age as your dad beating people up, if you remember going to see these actors in the movie theaters, or if you've always referred to them as 'those new young stars', you'll enjoy seeing them age with grace, dexterity, and pizazz.",7,0,0,25 June 2019
Knocked Up," Hilarous at the time
","It's every man's worst nightmare: after a one-night stand with a pretty girl you meet at a nightclub, she calls you up six weeks later and tells you she's pregnant and is going to keep the baby. I would imagine that if Knocked Up sent any lesson to its male audience, it would be to give out a fake phone number next time. Just kidding.This is one of those comedies that was hilarious at the time, but no one has any idea how funny it will be as the years pass. Who knows how funny it will be to laugh at a guy completely unprepared for fatherhood suddenly reading baby books and going shopping for bassinets? Years from now, audiences might wonder why Katherine Heigl wanted Seth Rogen to be an active father figure in her child's life if he was so irresponsible and ill equipped. For now, it's still funny when drunk people think they're good dancers, when doctors have less tact than you'd like, and when bedroom scenes don't go as planned. If you missed this one when it came out, gather up a group of your friends and have a steady stream of cocktails ready. Just don't do what I did: no matter how cool and modern your parents want to prove they are, don't watch this movie with them.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic sex scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",8,1,1,21 February 2020
Horrible Bosses," Funny, but a little raunchy
","Either Jennifer Aniston was still tied to the Faustian contract that forced her to work with Adam Sandler, or she was ridiculously determined to shed her FRIENDS image. Sure, that makes sense. Take the role that made you a millionaire and one of the most popular actresses in America, a household name, a hair and fashion icon, and gave you a decades-long career, and do everything you can to tear that image to shreds.Anyway, Jennifer Aniston's filthy sex-crazed character in Horrible Bosses aside, it's not the worst movie in the world. Parts of it are pretty funny, if you like raunchy comedies. I look at it as the male, much filthier version of 9 to 5. Three unhappy friends plot to 'get rid of' their horrible bosses. However, those who saw the original in the theater probably won't like this version; it has the distinct air of being aimed at the under-50 crowd.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to sexual jokes and adult situations, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",6,0,1,12 June 2017
The Best Years of Our Lives," The perfect tribute to our veterans
","'How many times have I said I hated you and believed it in my heart? How many times have you said you were sick and tired of me, and that we were all washed up? How many times have we had to fall in love all over again?'One of the many reasons to love The Best Years of Our Lives is because there are so many different characters, ensuring that everyone in the audience can identify with someone. This is a story that touches you, no matter how old you are. It may be the most beloved movie celebrating our veterans, but it isn't necessarily a 'coming home' movie. This is a movie that shows how different people cope with the same problem: What do you do when the best years of your life are behind you?Another of the many reasons to love this movie is Hugo Friedhofer's Academy-Award winning score. This is one of the few movies ever made where each character has his or her own theme. His music evokes so many emotions from his listeners, the perfect mixture of nostalgia, tragedy, hope, love, resignation, patriotism, and perseverance. One of the many times you watch the film-because I'm sure you'll buy a copy and watch it all the time-try and imagine how terribly Max Steiner or Franz Waxman would have ruined the tender scenes.Three veterans, Fredric March, Dana Andrews, and Harold Russell, return to the same hometown at the end of WWII. They're extremely different, and had they not been travelling companions on the way back, they probably wouldn't have even met. As it is, they make a fast friendship, and it changes the course of their lives. Freddie returns home to two grown children and must readjust to life at home with his wife and work at the bank. Dana left for the war a hotshot soda jerk, and he married just before shipping out. When he comes home, he's in for two rude awakenings: he's not qualified for civilian work, and his wife wants everything to be fun and carefree as it was before. Harold has to make the greatest adjustment of all: he lost his hands. His character, Homer, was different in the original novel; director William Wyler rewrote the character to have lost his hands because he'd met veteran Harold Russell and wanted him to act in the movie. There are no special effects in this film; the hooks you see are really Harold's hooks. It's no wonder he won Best Supporting Actor in 1947 and also took home a second Oscar for inspiring our veterans!It's impossible to choose a favorite of the three veterans' stories, because they're all relatable, cleverly written, and realistically acted. Even the smallest roles are acted beautifully. For example. Dana Andrew's father and stepmother, Roman Bonnen and Gladys George, are only onscreen for about five minutes, but their scene is one of the most touching for parents in the audience to watch. Fredric March won his second Oscar for this movie, and it's not hard to see why. He gives yet another incredible performance, and as his character frequently uses alcohol to help him adjust to his new life, his levels of intoxication are flawlessly realistic. Myrna Loy, Freddie's wife, is one of the most underrated classic actresses, and she gives the perfect portrayal of 'the wife'. Donna Reed and June Allyson were often cited as ideal wives during that time period, but they've got nothing on Myrna Loy. Dana Andrews wasn't often given roles to show off his dramatic talents, but he was able to show them off in The Best Years of Our Lives. His character in the original novel is the lead, and in the film, he's given many choice scenes to show other veterans they're not alone in their disappointments, regrets, and recurrent nightmares from the battlefield.As usual, William Wyler's impeccable directions adds to the dramatic essence of the film. He knows how to get to the core of the scene and never uses the camera to distract the audience. Equal to his talent is that of screenwriter Robert E. Sherwood. He took one of the most depressing, morbid novellas The Bishop's Wife and turned it into a delightful Christmas classic, and he adapted the novel Glory for Me, written entirely in verse, into a three hour masterpiece. I've read Glory for Me, and it's incredibly moving in its own right, but the talent it took to turn it into a screenplay is mindblowing.This is not only a wonderful tribute to our veterans, but it shows the serious adjustments they make when they come home, without ever becoming overly dramatic. This is not only one of the best old movies ever made, but it's one of the greatest films of all time. If you've never seen it, or you've only seen the remake The Lucky Ones, buy a copy, along with a box of Kleenex.",10,4,4,17 July 2018
Closer," Inappropriate and overrated
","If all films were like Closer, I'd never go to the movies again. As it is, it's a film adaptation of Patrick Marber's play, and this is the type of play that gives theatre a bad name. Marber writes in a style that 'serious philosophers' will probably find very deep, but I couldn't stand it. I don't think talking about sexual details with total strangers is deep. I don't think it's deep to assert the idea that technology which is supposed to bring us 'closer' actually distances us so much so that two men could accidentally have cyber-sex without knowing the gender on the other side of the screen.Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owen, and Natalie Portman are the key players in the film, each torn between two lovers. Anyone who is past their teens knows sex isn't the way to get to know a person, but in this film, the characters think jumping into bed or having extremely frank, inappropriate discussions about sex means they're getting 'closer'. It's not deep, it's not interesting, and it's not even well-acted. Clive and Natalie were nominated for Supporting Oscars, but I don't know why. Natalie prances around a stripper pole in a pink wig and a thong, so I can only imagine members of the Academy were distracted. I don't think showing nudity means the same thing as showing talent, but time and time again the Academy nominates women for baring their bodies.Teenaged boys will probably love this movie. Everyone else can, and probably should, skip it.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to strong sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",1,5,10,9 December 2017
Life of Pi," The tiger isn't friendly
","A reporter, Rafe Spall, comes to interview Irrfan Khan about his experiences. Told in chunks of flashbacks, we learn the extraordinary story about how he survived a shipwreck and floated along on the ocean on a little raft. By all accounts, he should have died, but since we know he didn't, any suspense we could have felt is replaced by sheer curiosity. The younger Irrfan is played by Suraj Sharma, and in his scenes, he has to interact with tons of computer graphics. Tumbled into the lifeboat with him are a ménage of animals: a zebra, a monkey, a hyena, and a tiger. In order to survive, he's forced to eat the animals until only the tiger is left for company. As the movie shows, with a tiger and a tiny survival manual, a man can weather any storm.Life of Pi is visually pleasing, but the symbolism won't appeal to everyone. If you're the type of person who really loves deep, symbolic stories that you can talk about for hours or weeks, you'll probably really love this movie. I haven't read the original novel, but friends of mine who have were very pleased by the film adaptation.I was completely taken aback by this movie and had no idea it would be so dramatic. After seeing the vague preview, I thought it was going to be a cheerful cartoon with a talking tiger, like The Jungle Book set in a lifeboat. You can imagine how surprised I was as the movie unfolded and not only did the tiger not talk, but it wasn't very friendly. However, even I ended up appreciating the film. Even I ended up in tears at the end.Give it a shot if you want to, as long as you know the tiger doesn't talk. After all, you've got to see what everyone's been talking about for seven years, right?DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. Since most of this movie takes place on the water, be prepared for some camera bobbing that will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",6,1,1,8 August 2019
The Devil Wears Prada," Typical suburban comedy
","The Devil Wears Prada is one of those harmless 'soccer mom' comedies that is meant to make women in the audience chuckle and men in the audience go to sleep. If you liked Under the Tuscan Sun, Eat Pray Love, Bridget Jones's Diary, or other similar chick flicks that feature an extremely average female protagonist who makes tons of mistakes, has more than one attractive man after her, and somehow manages to succeed and throw one-liners at those who have wronged her, you'll love this movie. It's fairly obvious from my description of the genre that I'm not a fan, and I spent more of the movie rolling my eyes than smiling.Anne Hathaway wants to balance a brilliant career and a wonderful relationship, but when she gets a new job as an assistant to a very demanding boss, her boyfriend Adrian Grenier starts to complain. Meryl Streep is the impossible, heartless, horrifying boss, but to anyone who's actually had a tough boss, she's not that bad. If you're the head of a successful fashion magazine, you're going to be a perfectionist. You wouldn't rise to the top if you settled for laziness, lateness, or mediocrity. She famously ends her orders with a careless, 'That's all,' as she dons her sunglasses and dismisses her underling. Anne finds it rude and would rather be treated more humanely. Has she never had a job before? If she's that sensitive, she doesn't belong in the workforce, let alone in the fashion magazine industry.Emily Blunt costars as Meryl's other assistant who resents Anne's ambition. Like everyone else's, her character is one-dimensional. Simon Baker is unrealistically perfect, Stanley Tucci is unnecessarily helpful, and Emily is incapable of smiling. Yes, given the title, you can expect to see a lot of pretty clothes and accessories, but is it really worth it?",3,0,1,21 April 2020
The Godfather: Part II," Another three hours?
","Why would anyone, anyone, ever tell Michael Corleone that she aborted her latest pregnancy? Did she not know he's vindictive, violent, and dangerous? Did she not know he's Catholic? Did she not see the first movie?Diane Keaton's character in The Godfather: Part II is a complete idiot. Diane Keaton's 'I had an abortion!' monologue is grating on the nerves, in part because of her poor acting and in part because of her character's stupidity. However, in reviewing the second installment of one of the most overrated franchises in film history, I have to mention that scene. The other, much more famous part to the film is Al Pacino's 'kiss of death'. You can take ten seconds and watch that clip, or you can sit down and watch the entire three and a half hours.Robert De Niro shows up in this movie, in an oddly-lit, hazy saturated, flashback to Vito Coleone's youth. I don't know why anyone cared so much about Marlon Brando that they wanted to watch scene after scene about a younger version of him and why he became bad, how he became worse, and all in Italian. Sure, you can watch a very young Robert De Niro speaking in a foreign language and killing people, but you can also rent any number of other Robert De Niro movies and turn on the subtitles.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

The Aviator," Appalling celebrity impressions
","The Aviator is a biopic of the famous Hollywood director and producer Howard Hughes. Martin Scorsese directed the film, so naturally, his beloved Leonardo DiCaprio starred as the title role. The film was advertised ad nauseum, so much so that even movie goers who didn't want to see it felt compelled to at least rent it at some point. Everyone loves to watch movies about old Hollywood, chalk-full of celebrity impressions of legendary stars, right? From a technical standpoint, the movie was very well done. The shots are well-framed, the colors are beautifully saturated, and the sound is well-created and mixed. However, if you're at all familiar with the actors and actresses portrayed on the screen, you will be beyond disappointed. To summarize, Cate Blanchett plays Katharine Hepburn, Kate Beckinsale plays Ava Gardner, Jude Law plays Errol Flynn, and Gwen Stefani plays Jean Harlow.Katharine Hepburn had such a distinctive way of talking that it's almost a game to imitate her, like Michael Caine's or Cary Grant's accents. Cate didn't sound anything like her, and I don't know why no one told her. In addition, she didn't look like her and she didn't even mimic the way she moved her body. Basically, she wore trousers and dyed her hair and thought the audiences would be fooled.Jude Law, while a very handsome man, doesn't happen to look like Errol Flynn. His eyes are further apart on his face and neither down-tilting nor deep set, his nostrils take a different angle, the tip of his nose is shorter, his bottom lip has a bow-shape, and his eyebrows have a different arch. So why was he cast? Why didn't the casting director pick Kevin Kline, who does look like Errol Flynn and actually portrayed him in a movie nine years later? Ava Gardner's defining characteristics are the large features of her face. She has a huge mouth, large eyebrows, eyes so far apart they seem to be falling off her face, and a big skull. I've been waiting in vain for someone in Hollywood to cast Eva Mendes as Ava Gardner, because I'm sure audiences would think Ava had been reincarnated. Kate Beckinsale has a small, delicate-looking frame, and a thin face. Her eyes and eyebrows are not falling off the sides of her face, and her smile doesn't scare people with its size. I can't imagine any reason why she was cast.Last, but certainly not least, we have Gwen Stefani, who was extremely excited about her film debut. She played the original bombshell, Marilyn Monroe's idol: Jean Harlow. Jean Harlow is one of my all-time favorite actresses, so I took this insult to her memory personally. We'll start with her face. Jean Harlow had close-set, deep-set eyes, a substantial nose, a cleft in her chin, an extremely small mouth, a very high forehead, and eyebrows that were stylish at the time but nowadays look clownish. Gwen Stefani, during her five minutes in the film, was not given any putty for her nose, her chin was cleft-less, her mouth was its normally large size, and her eyebrows had not been altered one millimeter in shape or position. This in itself is absurd. Next, we have body structure. Jean Harlow was very petite at 5'2' and had a beautifully curvaceous figure. She was diminutive. Gwen Stefani, at 5'7', is intimidating. Her shoulders are very prominent, and her athletic build is nothing like the woman she's supposed to be portraying. Finally, we have the feature that was Jean Harlow's trademark: her voice. Jean Harlow had an incredibly thick and distinctive accent, but when Gwen Stefani opened her mouth, she spoke like a breathy Valley Girl. It's appalling that she either refused to do her homework, take direction, or submit her resignation.With all my criticisms, I haven't yet mentioned one word about the lead actor. Throughout the film, Leonardo DiCaprio portrays a larger-than-life figure who ends up succumbing to a debilitating case of OCD. He was nominated for an Oscar for The Aviator, and when you watch it, you will concede that it's the type of role that usually gets a nomination. In general, I'm not a big fan of his because I always feel that he's acting. Actors are supposed to convince audiences that they're not acting and that there isn't a camera, crew members, sets, lights, and modern contraptions all around them. I never feel that way when watching Leo's performances. I always feel he's trying to pull from something that isn't there, and that if you went to see him in a community theater production, you'd think he was very good but probably stretching the limits of his talent. Unless you already love Leo and everything he does, you probably won't like this movie.While it didn't end up being a huge success at the box office, Hollywood couldn't get enough of it. The Aviator was nominated for eleven Oscars in 2005, taking home the gold for Costume Design, Art Direction, Cinematography, Editing, and Supporting Actress. Cate Blanchett has given some very good performances for which she should have won an Oscar; portraying an unrecognizable Katharine Hepburn isn't one of them.",1,3,5,9 December 2017
The Killing Fields," A beautiful modern classic
","It's alright if you don't know your history before you watch The Killing Fields, Roland Jaffe's film that was nominated for eight Oscars and won eight BAFTAs in 1985; you'll gain a wealth of knowledge from watching the movie. It's a true story, focusing on the experiences and friendship of New York Times journalist Sydney Schanberg, played by Sam Waterston, and Cambodian journalist Dith Pran, played by Haing S. Ngor, during the Cambodian Civil War in the 1970s.Beaten out by the incredibly overrated Amadeus, The Killing Fields should have absolutely won Best Picture. Not only is it a spectacular war picture, with surprises around every corner, realistic special effects and makeup, and harrowing struggles that will make you cringe and compel you to keep watching, but it's a beautiful, moving story of love and friendship. The two lead actors have such realistic chemistry together, it's sometimes difficult to separate them from their fictional roles. Haing S. Ngor lived a very sad life, and much of the film mirrors his own life experiences. The horrors he lives through in the film—and in real life, if you choose to look up his tragic backstory, which I don't really recommend—will bring you to tears more times than you'll be able to count.The Killing Fields will take you on an emotional roller-coaster, from fear to awe, horror, hope, sorrow, and inspiration. Some war movies are too upsetting to want to watch over again, but you're able to appreciate the craftsmanship and acting behind it. While the acting and production are fantastic, this is also a film that you can easily add to your home collection, watching it again and again with friends who haven't yet, so you can relive the emotions you felt during your first viewing. I've seen it three times, and each time, it has just as great an impact on my heart as the first. This is a modern classic that shouldn't be missed.",10,1,1,26 October 2017
The Color of Money," Paul Newman walks through it
","It's not necessary, but you'll probably want to watch The Hustler before you watch The Color of Money. In 1961, Paul Newman played 'Fast' Eddie, a pool hustler who took on a master player before he was ready. In 1986, he plays 'Fast' Eddie, a pool hustler who teaches and trains a younger version of himself. Basically, in the remake he's Paul Oldman instead of Paul Newman. Oh, and he won a make-up Oscar.So, if you liked The Hustler and it won't break you up to see 'Fast' Eddie with gray hair, getting made fun of by a cocky, young upstart, you'll probably be able to sit through The Color of Money. But the original is so much better; there's tension and drama rather than comic relief jokes. Tom Cruise plays the younger version of Paul Newman, but he's not as likable as his predecessor. And in this version, Paul Newman doesn't even try to act. He walks through it, as if he knows he's going to win an undeserved Oscar and he's ticked off about it. My advice: just watch The Hustler twice instead.",3,0,5,10 July 2017
Armageddon," Great cast with tons of energy
","Believe it or not, I managed to escape the 1990s without sitting through Armageddon. I'm notoriously squeamish about 'we're all going to die!' movies, so the only reason I did sit through it was because it was Bruce Willis's week on Hot Toasty Rag. Thankfully, my mom prepped me for it and told me everything that happened so I wouldn't be too scared or sad. So, if you're squeamish like me, and you want to watch it anyway, just ask your mom how it ends.He must have been busy, or didn't want to seem old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter, but the leading role Bruce Willis took on seemed tailor-made for Kevin Costner. Bruce held his own and wound up making a certain scene one of the most iconic scenes to come out of the '90s. He plays a gruff, tough oil driller with a soft spot for his daughter, Liv Tyler. Liv, raised around gruff, tough friends of her dad, has fallen in love with one of them, and her dad's not happy about it. Liv and Ben Affleck's romance seems a little unimportant when Bruce and his entire crew are called to NASA to save the world.Sure, I'm not a fan of the premise of the movie-a giant asteroid heading for Earth isn't my idea of a good time-but the cast is so delightful it makes everything worth it. Everyone has tons of energy and brings their own presence to the screen. Bruce had his classic combination of machoism mixed with being a softie on the inside. His fellow drillers-turned-astronauts are an eclectic group impossible to dislike. Steve Buscemi has a weakness for women, and his antics are hilarious and remarkably charming. Will Patton has a broken homelife, and he's given a touching scene the night before the rescue mission to reconcile with his family. Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson, and Ken Campbell aren't really given anything to do besides rattle off one-liners, but the one-liners are funny, so I don't think anyone will complain. Back at NASA, the head of the program and mission is Billy Bob Thornton, and he always brings a little something special to his roles. Keith David, a head honcho from Washington, brings tension and severity to the plot, and Jason Isaacs plays a scientist with good intentions.When Bruce's group is brought to NASA, they have to go through a mini-boot camp to make sure they're physically able to undergo the mission. It's a very funny sequence, started by William Fichtner, who plays the only certified astronaut on the mission, quipping, 'Talk about the wrong stuff!' when he sees the odd lineup. Bill has a great, meaty role, and he's completely believable as a disciplined, intelligent patriot who's scared yet confident. Peter Stormare puts on yet another accent, Russian this time, and plays a quirky astronaut who's been stationed in space for too long at the expense of his social skills. There are plenty of comic reliefs in this movie, Peter included, to even out the immense tension of the plot. Even though you'll be worrying about the end of the world, you'll be laughing through your fear.Since this is a Michael Bay movie, you can expect overactive camera angles and tons of special effects. The opening sequence is incredible, even when watching it twenty years later, as a meteor shower destroys New York City. There's a lot to appreciate in this movie, with the push and pull of the characters, everyone's special quirks and motivations, and the Oscar-nominated song, 'I Don't Want to Miss a Thing.' The romance between Liv and Ben is really the only downside; it's supposed to be true love and more powerful than the end of the Earth, but it feels like a summer fling between two teenagers. Liv is given many tearjerker scenes throughout the movie, and since she was only twenty years old during the filming, I decided to cut her some slack. I remember the difficulties of being a young actress and how sometimes the emotions you think are being projected in front of the camera don't end up coming across very well. So, when you watch her scenes and she's supposed to be crying over the danger her boyfriend and father are in, keep her age in mind and be kind.To call yourself a true '90s kid, you'll probably want to rent this movie. You'll probably have a good cry during the credits, but if you like these 'we're all going to die!' movies, you'll probably enjoy yourself during the process. Go ahead and bring your Kleenexes, and enjoy what this very large cast brings to the screen.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. Since I counted 66 spinning camera shots and 13 canted angles, as well as 4 scenes with strobelights and 6 scenes with a severe shaky camera, you should be aware that this movie could make you seriously sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since this is an 'end of the world' movie, I'd wait until my kids were a little older until they watch it.",7,3,4,8 July 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1," A nice respite
","It's ironic that many have hailed this movie as boring, a waste of time, and a shameless moneymaker, when I actually enjoyed it for two of those reasons. In the recently dramatic Hogwarts years, with beloved characters dropping like flies, isn't it nice to be able to catch your breath and watch two teenagers wander around in the forest without anything bad happening to them? And really, who cares that you spent an extra seven dollars at the movie theaters-which was the ticket price in 2010-since you got to see characters you grew up with in a world you immersed yourself in the past nine years up on the big screen? It doesn't seem like that big of a deal to me, and since the movies preceding and following Part One are so heavy, a respite is welcome.In this movie, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson decide to leave school and pursue the destruction of the great villain destroying all the good in the wizarding world. They're on the lookout for several magical objects that house part of Ralph Fiennes's power, but since the final book got split into two movies, it's a fair assumption that they don't accomplish their goal in this one. For most of the movie, the trio wanders around near the ocean, by the forest, and in their friends' houses. If that sounds incredibly boring, have no fear. Rupert becomes enormously moody and jealous, and he leaves their party of three. Dan and Emma continue to wander around by themselves, and as they're in very close quarters, they bond. Plenty of fans include their spontaneous dance as one of their favorite moments of the entire franchise. It's sweet, casual, and their chemistry lights up the screen like fireflies.The movie isn't completely without drama, tears, or violence. After all, the teenagers are trying to save the wizarding world and take down an incredibly powerful and evil bad guy with no nose! I liked this one better than Part Two because many people make it out of this movie alive, and even though there are some sad bits, it's not overwhelmingly depressing. Also included in this one is a pretty cool animated sequence explaining the meaning of the title that feels simultaneously realistic and stylized.",7,0,0,19 June 2019
Cold Mountain," Dramatic, heavy war film
","Civil War fans will find a favorite in the romantic drama Cold Mountain. Yes, there's violence, death, and unbearable tension, but that's what you expect when you buckle in for a movie that takes place during the Civil War! This one has a compelling story, good acting, and very authentic production values, so if you like this genre, it's worth it.Jude Law is a Southern soldier who, after being wounded, decides to risk being shot as a deserter and travel home to see his sweetheart Nicole Kidman. While he comes across helpful people, like Natalie Portman, during his journey, he spends most of his time avoiding the bad guys who are out for his head, namely Ray Winstone and Charlie Hunnam. Nicole pines away for Jude and finds it difficult to manage on her own until the feisty, Southern-cliché-ridden tomboy Renée Zellweger shows up and helps her. With Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson, Donald Sutherland, Cillian Murphy, Eileen Atkins, and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, you know you'll be in for some quality performances, even if the overall aura of the film isn't enjoyable.The most famous element to Cold Mountain, besides the very graphic sex scenes and Nicole Kidman's needless nudity, is the make-up Oscar it won for Renée Zellweger, who had lost the gold the year before for her tour-de-force performance in Chicago. As a native Southerner, playing the tell-it-like-it-is Southerner in Cold Mountain was not a stretch for her acting abilities, and even though I'm sure she was very happy to receive her statue, I'm sure she realized it was a make-up Oscar.Be prepared when you go into it that the movie's a very heavy drama, more on par with Free State of Jones than Gone with the Wind. It's pretty upsetting at times, and will more than likely leave you unsettled in the years after you watch it. My brother cites this as one of the films he wishes he hadn't seen, but I'm used to the type so I wasn't too phased. Use your own judgement whether or not you can handle it, but by all means, put the kiddies to bed before watching it! Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to nudity, violence, and graphic sex scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it. Also, there may or may not be a rape scene.",4,0,1,10 December 2017
North by Northwest," 'Games . . . must we?'
","There are so many iconic elements to North by Northwest, from Bernard Herrmann's complicated score, to the chase scene between Cary Grant and an airplane, to Eva Marie Saint's come-on, 'I don't particularly like the book I'm reading,' to the location of the end action scene. While everyone has their favorite parts to the movie, mine are not the most famous. My favorite scene is when Cary Grant drunkenly phones his mother from the police station. It's easily the funniest scene in the film, and I happen to adore Cary when he's in his humorous element. My favorite line in the film has become a frequently used household phrase of my family's: James Mason, in one of his iconic villainous roles, smirks at Cary and asks, 'Games . . . must we?' in his imitable accent. It's hilarious, and we frequently say, 'James . . . must we?' instead when we joke about him or his movies.I don't really like North by Northwest, even though I've seen it over a dozen times. It's one of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous films, and everyone in my family really likes it, so it was one of the classics I was raised on as a kid. In general, I find Hitchcock's movies to be a little slow, and I don't think Eva Marie Saint is as appealing as her role necessitates. If it weren't for Cary and James, I'd probably never watch this movie, but their energies together are great fun to watch. They were friends in real life, and when they verbally spar, it almost feels like they're playing a-dare I say it?-game.The plot is always a very intriguing one: an innocent misunderstanding leads certain people to believe Cary Grant has a different name, and he becomes implicated in a very dangerous situation. Since Cary's entirely innocent, it's easy to root for him, but since James is so charming and funny, it's incredibly easy to root for him, too. Aren't the best stories the ones where you're torn between rooting for the bad and good guys? If you think so, you'll probably really like North by Northwest. If you don't end up liking it, then you can ask the screen, 'James . . . must we?'",7,1,2,2 July 2018
Hugo," Long and boring
","While Martin Scorses's Hugo was a huge contender at the 2012 Oscars and took home five statuettes, the average audience member will come away from it thinking it was incredibly long and boring. What they don't know is the movie wasn't really made for the average person to appreciate—it was made for those who care about film history and preservation. Although the main hype was to educate people on the importance of film preservation, that message will go over most people's heads.A little boy, Asa Butterfield, lives in a train station, and as he grieves for his father, he feels compelled to solve a mystery involving his late father and others he hasn't yet met. While this is the main plot of the story, it's not executed very well. I saw this movie in the theaters, surrounded by lots of interested people, and hardly anyone could remember the key plot points once the film was over. The movie seems to bank on distracting the audience with very small parts by Sascha Baron Cohen, Emily Mortimer, Helen McCrory, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, Jude Law, Ray Winstone, and Ben Kingsley. None of these people really advance the already thin story, but if they had, the story would have been infinitely more interesting.By the time the old footage of silent movies is shown, audiences have most likely checked out and aren't paying attention. If you're in Hollywood or film school, you'll think this is an essential movie that pays tribute to a wonderful era. If you're an average Joe, you'll think you were ripped off by your ticket price.",3,2,3,11 December 2017
Over the Hedge," Cute cartoon for little boys
","While most cartoons feature cute and cuddly animals, Over the Hedge features a cast of scavenger animals on a quest for food. As anyone who's been visited by a racoon and his family knows, it's not ideal to have those types of animals hanging out near your home. So, when Bruce Willis the racoon, Steve Carell the squirrel, William Shatner the possum, Nick Nolte the bear, Wanda Sykes the skunk, and Eugene Levy the porcupine make their way into the suburbs, it's not going to be pleasant for the humans. Children may think squirrels are cute, but many homeowners know how devastating they can be. Garry Shandling gives voice to a turtle, who's not particularly menacing, but provides the slowness in contrast to everyone else's mania. As the title suggests, these animals are pushed 'over the edge' in their quest for food, searching in an area they wouldn't normally go.There are some cute jokes, like when Bruce Willis first recounts his discovery of how much waste suburbians produce, but keep in mind that this is a loud cartoon. Your nephews will probably like it much more than your nieces. If you sit through it with them, you'll also get to hear the memorable voices of Thomas Haden Church and Allison Janney, as well as a bit of dialogue from Avril Lavigne.",6,0,0,27 June 2019
Judgment at Nuremberg," Very heavy, but a must-see
","This is a heavy one, so be prepared. If you've seen any similar films, either about Nazi Germany or Apartheid South Africa, you'll know what to expect, but if you haven't, I'll give you a little background about the plot. Judgement at Nuremberg is a courtroom drama based on the real Nuremberg trials in 1947, where four Germans stand trial for their role in the atrocities of WW2. The plot would have been enough to make this film a famous classic, but in addition to the very heavy and popular subject matter, the all-star cast makes it a must-see for pretty much everyone:Spencer Tracy plays the judge, Burt Lancaster is one of the defendants, Richard Widmark is the prosecutor, Maximilian Schell is the defense attorney, and Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich, Montgomery Clift, and William Shatner join the courtroom action. Everyone is given powerful monologues to recite. Director Stanley Kramer must have given his actors fantastic direction, because they're all in top form as they cry, argue, judge, defend, and confess. Maximilian Schell took home the Best Actor Oscar in 1962, and the film garnered another nine nominations that year.",7,1,2,21 June 2018
We're the Millers," So, so bad
","Whatever contract Jennifer Aniston signed that wound her up in the unequivocal flop Just Go with It must have tied her to this piece of trash. Granted, I actually sat through the entire movie, so it is better than her Adam Sandler creation.The premise is terrible. If Jennifer Aniston hadn't been in it, I never ever would have seen it. The tagline: 'A veteran pot dealer creates a fake family as part of his plan to move a huge shipment of weed into the U.S. from Mexico.' Included in the fake family is a stripper as the mother, a runaway girl, and a teenage virgin boy. I have a problem with this. The label 'virgin' is an insult now? This teenage boy has to act like an imbecile, just because he isn't worldy wise? And for that matter, not having sex doesn't make you unwordly, just as having sex doesn't bestow you with common sense. During one scene, the 'family' is listening to the radio, and a rap song starts. The idiotic virgin starts rapping along. He knows all the lyrics, and the rest of the family is awed and impressed. It's supposed to be funny, but I found it offensive and even racist.If you like really stupid, off-color comedies that basically promote drug use, you might find this funny. Just one last question: who told Jennifer Aniston it was a good idea to play a stripper? Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to the drug content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",1,7,14,12 June 2017
Spider-Man," The best franchise
","I'm extremely loyal to the Tobey Maguire Spider-Man series. In my opinion, there are no other acceptable versions, and I'd never even consider watching the subsequent remakes. Tobey is the perfect Peter Parker, and the movies are treated with such care and respect, they don't feel like traditional comic book movies at all.The first one is the origin story, and who doesn't love the first in a series when everything is explained and introduced? Tobey is the unpopular, shy high schooler who has a crush on the girl next door and lives with his aunt and uncle. Mary Jane, the beautiful heroine, is played by Kirsten Dunst, and while she famously dyed her locks red for the subsequent movies, she wears a wig in the first one. I prefer the shiny, lustrous wig since it's more vibrant and attention-grabbing. Rosemary Harris may retain her role as Aunt May in all three movies, but Cliff Robertson gets to deliver the immortal line, 'With great power comes great responsibility.' Everyone in this movie is memorable and important, and if you grew up watching this franchise in the theaters, your loyalty probably lies with them. J.K. Simmons seems like he crawled off the comic pages as the hard-boiled newspaper editor with hilarious one-liners. Who else can play the father-son Osborns but Willem Dafoe and James Franco, a pair of actors capable of being incredibly likable with a darker edge beneath the surface? Who else can endear himself as an unlikely hero who tries to atone and clean up crime in the big, bad city but Tobey Maguire and his innocent, expressive eyes?Obviously, the Spider-Man movies are going to have great special effects and thrilling action sequences. Whether he's battling the Green Goblin or merely testing out his new flying powers, you're in for a great, fun ride.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Spider-Man flies, there are some swift camera movements that will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",10,1,2,24 February 2020
Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban," Directing and screenwriter stand out in perfection
","Everyone's favorite of the Harry Potter movies is the first one, right? A close second place for me and my family is the third installment: Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. Not only is the story very interesting, fast-paced, and full of mysterious twists, but director Alfonso Cuaron turns ordinary exposition shots into works of art. After seeing the same castle and sets the past two movies, it's intriguing to see them filmed differently. It reminds you to pay attention to details as well as the big picture, and it subtly tells you that you'll need to see the movie at least twice to understand its full potential. There's a famous transition he films through the clock tower that's continually gorgeous no matter how many times you've seen it.Onto the story: Once again, Daniel Radcliffe starts the movie unhappy in the home of his aunt and uncle, Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths. This time around, since he's entering his teenage years, he gets fed up and runs away to the wizarding world before summer vacation has ended. Everyone's worried about him because there's been a prison break from Alcatraz-I mean, Azkaban-and a dangerous criminal, Gary Oldman, is on the loose. Entering his third year of school with all that on his mind, he still has to deal with the hostility of his least favorite teacher, Alan Rickman, taunts from the school bully, Tom Felton, and the presence of some very scary guards hanging around the school who are on the lookout for Gary but might kill anyone else on accident. Hogwarts sure isn't the safest school out there, is it?Believe me, that's just the start of the plot, and as the film progresses, you'll be endlessly fascinated by the story. Screenwriter Steve Kloves managed to sew the scenes together tightly without making anything feel rushed, and since the audience already knows the ins and outs of the Hogwarts world, there's no time spent on explanations or exposition. There are a few new additions in this movie, of course: the Marauder's Map that shows the locations of everyone on campus, Hagrid's pet Hippogriff, the speedy public transit for the wizarding world, the Dementors and the special spell that repels them, and the new 'guest star' teacher, ¬¬¬David Thewlis, who's very sympathetic and easy to like. Keep an eye out for Julie Christie, who has a cameo as a pub owner, Emma Thompson as the 'psychic' divinity teacher, and Timothy Spall.The only blot of imperfection on an otherwise imperfect film is the replacement of Richard Harris with Michael Gambon. Even if you managed to get used to him in later films, it's quite a shock to have him installed in this movie. Not only does he look nothing like his predecessor, but he's fashioned differently and delivers every line as if he thought to himself, 'How wouldn't Richard Harris have said this line?' If he truly did have a vastly different interpretation of the character, it would have been nice to ease the audience into it. The replacement couldn't have been helped, unless a huge change to the rest of the stories was made-had the school given a very sad but touching funeral for Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall been promoted to Headmistress, the rest of the stories still would have been functional, and with an added boost for feminist viewers-but we'll all miss Richard Harris's twinkling blue eyes and kind, sensitive delivery.",10,1,2,17 June 2019
Now You See Me," Fun and flashy
","Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Isla Fisher, and Dave Franco are 'The Four Horsemen', a group of magicians who put on mind-blowing shows in Las Vegas. They're a bit of an odd pairing, since Jess is inexplicably and unbelievably a ladies' man, Woody keeps hitting on Isla even though she doesn't like him, and Dave seems like he's playing dress-up to fit in with the grown-ups. But, they get along for the most part and manage to amuse the movie-going audience. When they rob a bank during their magic show, it puts the FBI and Interpol on their trail. Mark Ruffalo and Melanie Laurent are the agents, and even though she's pretty grungy, he starts falling for her anyway. Add in Morgan Freeman, a man who makes a living out of exposing frauds, and Michael Caine, the owner of the robbed bank, and The Four Horsemen don't have many friends left!If you like quick-witted scripts with lots of twists and turns, this is a great one for you to rent. Yes, I've criticized the casting a bit, but Ed Solomon, Boaz Yakin, and Edward Ricourt's script is very entertaining. It's fun and flashy, with surprises you'll never see coming. Plus, every little boy who learned card tricks when he was little can get a front row seat to a truly incredible magic show! DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not your friend. There are lots of camera swirls and flashy lights during the magic shows, and it might make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",6,0,0,24 November 2017
Die Hard 2," Most people will skip this one
","If you liked Die Hard so much that you wished for a remake, you're in luck! Die Hard 2 features another terrorist hold-up during Christmastime, separating policeman Bruce Willis from his wife. In a tongue-in-cheek line, Bruce quips at the unlikeliness the same thing could happen to the same guy over two different Christmases.This time around, the bad guy, William Sadler, takes control of Washington Dulles airport and knocks the power out. With no radio communication to incoming planes, no runway lights, and a limited amount of fuel in the airborne vehicles, Bruce Willis certainly has a crisis on his hands. Add in the coincidence that his wife is on one of the airplanes, and he's desperate to save the day! There are tons of action-packed sequences, just like the first one, but unfortunately, since the hostage situation involves airplanes potentially crashing into our nation's capital, this installment isn't really anyone's favorite. Die Hard 2 is the volume most Americans try to forget, since nowadays, the plot hits a little too close to home. You can skip it if you want to, and head on over to the third movie.",4,0,1,15 July 2019
Mamma Mia!," Fun, funny, and flirty
","The wildly popular stage success Mamma Mia! finally took its place on the big screen ten years after Broadway showcased ABBA's most beloved songs. Even if you don't like ABBA-like my mom-you're going to eventually rent this movie. You'll probably end up owning it, like my mom does. It's just so cute! Yes, most of the songs don't have anything to do with the surrounding scenes and are just an excuse to prance around and sing another ABBA tune, but it's fun and funny and flirty. There are a few songs that are very well placed, towards the end, and those moments where the sing-a-long movie turns into a real musical are worth the wait.If you've seen Postcards from the Edge, you know Meryl Streep can sing the pants off a country song. But she has other styles, too! Taking the leading role, she gets to belt out, 'The Winner Takes It All,' as well as softly croon, 'Slipping Through My Fingers.' And, since she's Meryl Streep, she doesn't play this as a silly musical comedy. She finds the human aspect in the struggling single mother and shows the audience that the primary motivation of her life has been her daughter. Yes, she prances around during the random 'Dancing Queen' number, but whenever she's anywhere near her daughter, she's kissing and hugging and wiping away sentimental tears. The point of the movie is not one giant excuse to sing disco songs. It's a daughter's attempt to find herself by meeting her father, unaware that she has such a strong bond with her mother, the rest doesn't really matter. If the mother character doesn't act like a mother, the story doesn't work. No one can play Mother like Meryl Streep can, and when she gazes at her daughter, memories of her childhood are so vivid, the audience can practically see them.Not many people know this, because the original 1968 screenplay doesn't get any credit, but Mamma Mia! is a musical version of the adorable Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell. I like the original story infinitely better, so if you like the idea of a single mother with three potential fathers to her child, check out Gina Lollobrigida's comedy.Feel free to laugh at me, but every time I watch Mamma Mia!, I bawl my eyes out. I have two favorite songs in the movie, and one of them was unfortunately cut from the final print. I always make sure to watch 'The Name of the Game' included in the deleted scenes of my DVD, because it's a wonderfully fitting moment between Amanda Seyfried and one of her potential fathers, Stellan Skarsgard. 'Slipping Through My Fingers' was not cut from the film, and it never fails to make me cry. As Amanda gets ready for her wedding, Meryl sings a touching tribute to her childhood. Amanda cuts her leg while shaving, and Meryl kisses it better with a Band-Aid. She's still a little girl who needs her mother, and getting married won't ever change that.Filmed on location in Greece, the sparkling blue waters, beautiful beaches and cliffs will make you want to plan your next vacation. This movie is a lot of fun, and although it's not as good as its predecessor, it's a great choice when you want to relax and watch a bunch of actors and actresses having a blast. It's so obvious that Pierce Brosnan, Stellan Skarsgard, and Colin Firth enjoy every bit of screen time singing, and dancing, and Amanda Seyfried has just as much fun with her two bridesmaids as Meryl Streep has with her two girlfriends, Christine Baranski and Julie Walters. Whether you watch it for the first or hundredth time, with your mom, your girlfriends, or by yourself, you know you're in for a great evening when you pop in Mamma Mia!DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. When Meryl Streep goes up on the roof during 'Mamma Mia,' there's a huge upside-down camera swirl. There's another swirl at the beginning of 'Chiquitita'. And during 'Voulez-Vous' there are both fluid camera movements and flashing lights that will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",9,1,3,4 May 2020
Zulu," Michael Caine looks very dreamy
","While Zulu is one of the most famous war movies to come out of the 1960s, and there are many reasons to watch it, if you don't usually like that genre, you probably won't like it. Similar to the plot of 55 Days at Peking, one of my all-time favorite war films, this movie follows a small group of British soldiers, grossly outnumbered by the enemy, who try to hold out as long as possible.Among the soldiers are Lieutenants Stanley Baker and Michael Caine, as well as Nigel Green, James Booth, Neil McCarthy, Ivor Emmanuel, Paul Daneman, and Glynn Edwards. While sometimes Stanley and Michael differ in their views of how to command the troops, Jack Hawkins rants and raves of the virtues of peace because he's a missionary. Jack's daughter Ulla Jacobsson tries to help among the wounded men, but since she's the only woman in the movie, sometimes she doesn't get treated very fairly.It wasn't Michael Caine's first movie—I saw him in a movie from 1957—it was his first major role, so the studio gave him a large 'introducing' credit. If you're a Michael Caine fan, and you can tolerate a long, tedious war film, you might want to see him two years before his overnight stardom from Alfie. Even if you're not particularly a fan, but you want to see him in an extremely handsome role, he looks particularly dreamy in Zulu.All in all, I was pretty bored—when I wasn't drooling over Michael Caine, that is. The film wasn't nearly as interesting as other war flicks I've seen, and even Richard Burton's official sounding narration wasn't able to save it.",4,3,6,23 November 2017
Lawrence of Arabia," Peter O'Toole should have won an Oscar
","With only a few television credits and bit parts in Hollywood, Peter O'Toole made his breakthrough performance in Lawrence of Arabia. Lawrence of Arabia is one of those movies that everyone remembers a scene from even if they haven't seen the four-hour epic all the way through. Between the famous theme from Maurice Jarre, the iconic rooftop silhouette, 'No prisoners!', the appetizing order of lemonade, Omar Sharif's entrance, Peter O'Toole's beautiful blue eyes sparkling in the middle of the desert, and the hundreds of fight scenes, there are plenty of memorable moments to choose from when you relive the movie as you talk about it with your friends.In case you don't know, David Lean's sprawling, dazzling epic is about T.E. Lawrence's time fighting in the Arabian Peninsula. This is much more than just another WWI movie. Peter O'Toole is not a gung-ho commanding officer who joyfully leads his men into battle. He's incredibly conflicted and disgusted by war. To him, a dead soldier is not a statistic, it's a man. During the famous 'No prisoners!' scene, in which he only utters those two words, his face shows an incredible array of emotions. If you watch that scene and don't simultaneously think he was robbed of his Oscar and fall in love with him, well, watch it again. Guys, feel free to develop a man-crush; no one will blame you. After all, Noel Coward famously quoted, 'If *he* had been any prettier, the film would have been called Florence of Arabia.'Unfortunately for Peter O'Toole, this incredible epic was released during the same year as To Kill a Mockingbird, and no one else stood a chance come Oscar time. He was in pretty good company, though, since Burt Lancaster and Jack Lemmon also lost out that year after giving excellent performances in Birdman of Alcatraz and Days of Wine and Roses, respectively. The good news is Lawrence of Arabia did win Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Cinematography, among others. This a great compromise movie for date night, if you don't mind a four-hour running time. Ladies will get to drool over the ridiculously handsome Peter O'Toole-as Robin Williams said in Aladdin, 'Pick a feature!'-and gents will get lost in the endless fighting and strategy scenes with nary a woman in sight. This is definitely a man's movie, and if it weren't for the perfect piece of eye candy, no woman in her right mind would probably watch it. If you're considering renting it, check out the preview. Usually, old movies were chopped into terrible previews, but this one is pretty good. It gives a pretty good representation of the film and shows off the supporting cast, including Omar Sharif, Anthony Quinn, Alec Guinness, Jack Hawkins, Arthur Kennedy, Jose Ferrer, Anthony Quayle, and Claude Rains.",7,1,3,22 May 2018
Dog Day Afternoon," It really is a classic
","'Am I the only one who cares about this? I mean, at least I watched Dog Day Afternoon.' So says Mena Suvari in the hilarious teen comedy Sugar and Spice when she and her fellow cheerleaders prepare to rob a bank. For years, that was my only knowledge of the famous '70s heist film, and for the sake of Mena, I finally decided to rent it.To be honest, I really only watch heist movies if there's a handsome man among the cast. Guns and violence and certain imprisonment aren't my ideal story elements, because I'm not a testosterone-raging male. Dog Day Afternoon is one of the classic bank robbery movies, so if you do love this genre, you're going to want to make sure you've seen it. It's sure to satisfy all the men in the audience, and the ladies who love Al Pacino's gorgeous, feathery hairstyle.While I was amused, decades after this movie's release, to see all the bits that are now famous-the gift-wrapped guns, 'Attica,' among others-I can imagine the tension felt while sitting in the theaters in 1975 as Al Pacino and John Cazele hold hostages inside the bank and their plans start unraveling. There's a reason this movie has become one of the standards all other heist movies are measured against: it's good. There's tension galore as the wild, emotional star of the '70s has to improvise to try and get away with his terrible crime, so perch yourself on the edge of your seat and don't get up for more popcorn.",7,2,2,28 January 2019
The Longest Day," Incredible war epic masterfully directed
","Steven Spielberg's got nothing on The Longest Day. Once you watch this movie, you'll wonder why he felt the need to reenact the landing at Normandy, after Ken Annakin, Andrew Marton, Bernhard Wicki, and Darryl F. Zanuck did such a wonderful job capturing the moment thirty-five years earlier. The beginning of this movie is extremely slow, and the first half hour could have easily been cut. The start of the film could have been when Eddie Albert announces, 'Next stop: Normandy.' But after that announcement, it's very good, and the beach scene in so incredibly filmed, it feels like watching a remake would be sacrilegious. There's a long tracking shot where everyone rushes in, machine guns knocking people off, bombs crashing down, chaos in every inch of the frame, helicopter shots that show planes picking off soldiers on the sand-what else do you need? Blood and guts aren't really necessary to capture the horror and seriousness of war, not if it's filmed correctly. And those four certainly filmed it right.It seems like everyone who wasn't in 1962's star-studded epic How the West was Won joined the star-studded cast of 1962's The Longest Day. Except Henry Fonda. He can do whatever he wants, so he was in both movies. This three-hour war drama chronicles D-Day, and as the title forewarns you, it's long. But if you want to see John Wayne, Richard Burton, Robert Mitchum, Curd Jurgens, Henry Fonda, Red Buttons, Eddie Albert, Peter Lawford, Rod Steiger, Mel Ferrer, Robert Wagner, Sean Connery, Paul Anka, Christian Marquand, Kenneth More, Gert Frobe, Richard Beymer, Steve Forrest, Ray Danton, Paul Hartmann, Sal Mineo, Roddy McDowall, Edmond O'Brien, Tommy Sands, Peter van Eyck, Richard Todd, and George Segal all together in one movie with parts ranging from five seconds to thirty minutes, you can rent it. Just to warn you, everyone in this movie speaks their native language, so a good two-thirds of the movie aren't in English. The first section of the movie involves the French, German, American, and English bigwigs planning and strategizing. There's lots of subtitles, and if that's not your cup of tea, you'll get bored. Once you get past the first thirty minutes, it doesn't feel so long, because then the battle scenes start.Believe it or not, there's actually a lighter side to this movie. In the middle of the landing at Normandy, a Frenchman rushes up to the soldiers waving a bottle of champagne, welcoming them and thanking them for coming. Peter Lawford says, 'That's most kind of you. Very nice to meet you! Perhaps next time, you see, we have a previous engagement-the war!' Very dry and very British, but at a time like that, it's nice to see good old fashioned manners towards someone who is so happy to see the soldiers. In the same scene, Sean Connery is joking with another soldier, and his commanding officer, Kenneth More, keeps encouraging the soldiers to get off the beach, since all the gunfire is upsetting his dog. He shouts at them, 'Don't stand there yapping! The war's over there!'If you like watching classic war movies, this is one of the most famous out there. Yes, it's filmed in black and white, but it's just supposed to transport you back in time and add to the realism. And no, there's no blood or guts, but with all the drama and tension in the battle scenes-once you get past the first thirty minutes-there's no need for all those extras. The second half of the movie in Normandy is riveting and incredible to watch. No wonder it took four people to direct this movie!",8,2,4,22 August 2018
Slap Shot," Pretty dated
","For the life of me, I have no idea why Slap Shot is a famous movie. It's so incredibly dated! I'm really sorry, Paul Newman, but you've made so many other better movies; if I write one bad review, I hope you'll understand.Newman plays a hockey player and coach in this utterly 70s sports movie that seems to be both spoofing itself and taking itself entirely too seriously. The players and fans get into brawls during games, in order to gain attention and popularity. It's really silly. Maybe forty years ago, it was supposed to be funny, but it isn't anymore. And since it's also a pretty lousy sports movie, I can't really think of any reason to recommend it, even to Paul Newman fans. If you want to watch a Paul Newman sports movie, try Somebody Up There Likes Me instead.",2,4,10,10 July 2017
Donnie Brasco," Gritty and upsetting
","For many years after I watched Donnie Brasco, I longed for the type of technology that could extract the film from my brain. Fortunately, years have passed since, and unfortunately, other more disturbing movies have taken its place in my mind as movies I wish I'd never seen. If you're a sensitive person who gets seriously upset by gritty, upsetting true crime stories, don't watch Donnie Brasco, no matter how famous you think it is.As a young film student, I was pressured into watching this movie by my male peers. This is a very masculine film, with no redeeming qualities for female viewers. It's the true story of an undercover FBI agent, played by Johnny Depp, who gets so immersed in his assignment that he loses touch of who he really is. His assignment is to join the mafia and get close to head mafioso Al Pacino, and while it's understandable that Al is magnetic and alluring, the audience is constantly aware that this is a true story. The killings and the choices and the danger are real, unlike many 'gangster pictures' that glorify street violence. To me, that made all the difference in the world. One might say that the film, and all the people involved, must have been excellent for me to have such a negative reaction. Frankly, I don't care. There was no purpose in this 'exposé' for me; I can't wage a one-woman campaign against mob violence, nor do I have the opportunity to stop anyone in my environment from joining such a crowd. It was merely upsetting, and I wish I'd never watched it.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",2,2,9,27 January 2019
For Love of the Game," So incredibly boring
","Kevin Costner plays a handsome, famous baseball pitcher who can have any woman in the world, and for absolutely no reason, he chooses Kelly Preston, a bespectacled, mousy, problem-ridden, ordinary girl. Straight out of the Every Woman's Fantasy playbook, a role Costner has shouldered several times over the years. In his own words, she's 'a bummer'—that line is my favorite part of the movie—but he just can't live without her? At two hours and twenty minutes, For Love of the Game is far too long. I kept fast forwarding to get to the ending. She's unlikable, he's unrealistic, the pseudo-sad piano music will drive you insane, and there's not enough baseball to make it an interesting sports movie. Then again, since it really isn't intended to be an interesting sports movie, there's altogether too much baseball, adding to the boredom that sets in as soon as Kelly Preston shows up.Unless you're angry with someone and want to torture him by sitting him in front of this movie, there's really no reason to rent it. I know that's harsh, but I'm still trying to figure out why anyone, after reading the script, agreed to make it in the first place.",1,3,8,24 June 2017
Quiz Show," Great social commentary film
","Those of you who remember The Joker is Wild or other similar quiz shows in the 1950s and 1960s on television will be transported back in time during the film Quiz Show. Those of you who are a little younger will think Quiz Show is a very fascinating and creative film. But to my fellow young'uns, let me tell you this: it's a true story.This piece of social commentary that's sometimes hard to watch but has fantastic acting, well framed shots, and great scene transitions is directed by none other than Robert Redford, the master of all elements mentioned. Quiz Show really is an important movie even though it's the poster-child for the 'people are mean' mentality. It was nominated for Best Picture, Director, and Supporting Actor at the Oscars, but John Turturro's and Ralph Fiennes's performances went unrecognized. But, it was released in 1994, the same year as Forrest Gump and The Shawshank Redemption, so it didn't really stand a chance during awards season.In the film, Christopher McDonald is the host of the incredibly popular television quiz show '21'. David Paymer and Hank Azaria are the show's producers. Martin Scorsese is an executive to the show's product sponsor. Everyone has a stake in the ratings, so when successful contestant John Turturro wanes in audience popularity, the network asks him to 'take a dive'. Will he do it? Will he tell the truth that the show is being rigged—and, more importantly, will anyone listen? While I kept asking myself, 'Why wasn't this Timothy Hutton?' every time Rob Morrow was on the screen, the other leads gave excellent performances, most of them more likable in this movie than in any of their other movies I'd seen. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time, and each time a new character's plight was introduced, my heart completely transferred its sympathy to him, a testament to Paul Attanasio's fast-paced and well-defined script. Every character was made to be both likable and unlikable; this is the type of movie that will make you talk about it afterwards.",8,3,3,26 September 2017
The Dark Knight," Not what Batman is supposed to be
","In Christopher Nolan's darker reboot of the Batman franchise, Christian Bale plays the masked hero. Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman, and Michael Caine join the cast as regulars, with guest stars in each installment as villains or temporary females. I watched the previews for these films and never had any desire to watch them. To me, Michael Keaton is Batman, and no remake can ever compare. My brother practically forced me to watch The Dark Knight, after Heath Ledger won his posthumous Oscar, and even though he raved and raved, I remained unimpressed. To me, the Batman films aren't supposed to be that dark and disturbing. Batman originated in a comic book, and should therefore be accessible to children. Nolan's imagination of Gotham City does not keep in view of the original comic or previous adaptations. It has the same feel of the types of films that specialize in serial killers.My brother raved about Christian Bale's American accent. I'd heard him show his talent at accents in other films, so this gravelly-voiced performance didn't terribly impress me. The villains—Aaron Eckhart as Two-Face, Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow—were needlessly frightening and relied on gimmicks rather than acting. Heath Ledger's untimely death was extremely tragic, but his performance in this film didn't warrant a nomination, let alone an Oscar win. He had a lot of makeup on, spoke in a different accent, and flicked his tongue in and out so audiences would think he's insane. The tongue flick is as old a trick in the book as it is to chew gum when playing a bimbo.There are extended action sequences that showcase vast special effects, so if you only watch movies based on how impressive the special effects are, you will probably want to rent this one. And, to be honest, younger audiences will probably really enjoy the reboot of the series. They didn't grow up watching it as originally intended, and today's audiences have short attention spans that need to be sensationalized every few minutes. Older folks who liked the Michael Keaton movies should stay far away from these.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to scary and upsetting images, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",2,6,10,23 November 2017
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," A respite from the dark
","Are there any of you out there who really love the Harry Potter movies but wish they were shorter and funnier? Your favorite of the eight-part series will probably be the fifth: Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. Clocking in at twenty minutes less than the previous movie, several montages, set to new composer Nicholas Hooper's lively and comedic music, help move the plot along. This is the only installment Steve Kloves didn't write, and the new screenwriter Michael Goldenberg tries to turn the film into as much of a comedy as he can, probably to console the audience after the dark ending of the previous film. As the students grow older and battle their raging hormones, the audience gets to laugh at them and relax.Joining the cast is Imelda Staunton, playing a sickeningly sweet and secretly sadistic new teacher. She plays her part so well, it's almost impossible to believe she played different, sympathetic roles in her career. With their new hormones, new haircuts, and new teenage angst, the students band together to form a secret club to rebel against their new teacher and the organization she represents. They practice combat spells, and while there are quite a few pratfalls in those sequences, it's a reminder to the audience to treasure their laughter while they can. The next few movies will be considerably darker and more violent.There is a bit of violence towards the end of this movie, so if you're watching it with little kids, you might want to encourage them to fall asleep before it's over or give them a warning of what's about to happen. Helena Bonham Carter makes her first appearance in this movie, and without spoiling what happens, be prepared to absolutely hate her.One of the plot points in this film involves the link between the hero and villain, through mind control. Since Harry has some secrets he doesn't want Ralph Fiennes to discover, he attends special mind control training with Professor Snape. These scenes were easily the most interesting in the novel, and while they're considerably paired down in the movie, they give the audience a taste of what they've been craving the most: insight into Snape's character. It's been an ongoing struggle wondering whether he's a bad guy or not, and since Alan Rickman captures all his nuances it's impossible to tell for certain. Is he Hans Gruber from Die Hard or Colonel Brandon from Sense and Sensibility? This movie won't tell you, but you'll get to see some brief flashbacks of his schoolboy days at Hogwarts to help you make up your mind. If you like these scenes, you'll really enjoy the next movie, but for now, enjoy what's generally referred to as 'The Riverdance One'.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. During some of the montages and mind control training sessions, there are some spinning or twirling visuals. Also, when Harry dreams about the dark hallway, the camera is in his POV for a few seconds, and it will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, there's some upsetting violence at the end of the movie, so I'd wait until my kids were pre-teens before letting them watch it.",7,0,0,17 June 2019
Singin' in the Rain," Overrated but cute
","It's a shame that Gene Kelly's most famous movie is Singin' in the Rain. This is a man who's danced with a cartoon, on roller skates, and with a trash can lid strapped to one foot, but for some reason, he's famous for splashing around in some puddles and posing on a lamppost. The same argument can be said about Donald O'Connor who got his start singing with Bing Crosby, recreated many of Buster Keaton's famous stunts, and did one of the most impressive dances in screen history where he popped balloons while tap dancing-yet he's remembered for making faces and running into a wall during 'Make 'Em Laugh'.Still, as much as I've just dissed Singin' in the Rain, the movie does have it's good parts. As a kid, I didn't like this movie and actually got rid of my DVD copy, but when I grew up and went to film school, I grew a new appreciation for it. I learned that there was a time when movies were made without sound and that the adding of the element was often difficult for actors and crewmen to adjust to. Kids don't know these things, so when an entire scene is devoted to Jean Hagen's inability to change her lowlife accent into a cultured one, they don't care. When the actors learn they can't move their face away from the microphone, kids don't care or understand. When actors lip-synch and loop their own dialogue, kids are bored and wondering when they can go outside and play. But film students will definitely get a kick out of it.Gene Kelly and Jean Hagen are silent movie stars in the 1920s, and the tongue-in-cheek salute to the silent era is very amusing. With the advent of sound, they each face challenges to keep their jobs and their adoring public. Also, Gene clashes with a hopeful starlet, Debbie Reynolds, who ends up dubbing Jean's speaking and singing voice. Interestingly enough, Debbie's singing voice was dubbed by Betty Noyes. She also wasn't nearly as marvelous a dancer as her costars, and during rehearsals, she reportedly cowered under the piano crying because it was too difficult to live up to Gene Kelly's standards. One has to wonder why she was kept on in the cast-or why she was cast in the first place-and if she showed such unprofessional behavior on the set, why she continued to have a career. In case you can't tell, I'm not a Debbie Reynolds fan; she's ruined for me almost everything she's been in.When all's said and done, this movie is a classic and a staple in old musical viewings. You're going to want to see this one. It has cute songs, like 'Moses Supposes' and 'You Are My Lucky Star' and classic dance numbers. If you've seen Donald O'Connor running into a wall, Gene Kelly posing next to a lamppost, or the three leads toppling over a couch, those famous clips are from this movie.",6,1,2,16 December 2018
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," If only it were true
","Expect a bit of a weird script from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, since it was co-written by Charlie Kaufman. While some of his films are just too strange for me to enjoy, this one is very good. The premise is so intriguing, everyone who watches it can't help but wish it could really happen in real life. Imagine a procedure that could erase certain selected memories. You talk to the doctor, explain what you want to remove, bring in objects or your diary that make you recall those memories, and as those parts of your brain light up in recognition, he removes them. Isn't that fantastic?Unfortunately, it's only a movie, despite the very realistic infomercial of Tom Wilkinson telling you all about the simple procedure. In the imaginative movie, people can go to Dr. Wilkinson's office and remove any memory of a painful breakup; letters will be sent to their friends informing them of the operation and requesting that they never try to remind them since it will only cause confusion. Once the memories have been erased, so has the memory of visiting the doctor, otherwise the person might wonder what it was they wanted to forget.Doesn't this premise make you want to rent it? I don't have to tell you Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet are the fantastic dramatic leads, or that the entire cast gives wonderful performances. I don't have to entice you with the supporting cast of Tom Wilkinson, Mark Ruffalo, Elijah Wood, Jane Adams, David Cross, and Kirsten Dunst. Tom is perfectly cast as the trustworthy doctor, and Kirsten takes a small but memorable role that's different from the parts she's played in her teenaged career. You'll want to rent it without knowing anything else about it, won't you? Good, but don't watch it with your sweetie pie, as it might make for a very awkward evening.",8,0,0,6 June 2019
Alice in Wonderland," Swirly and colorful, but disappointing
","There have been so many film adaptations of Alice in Wonderland, both before and after Disney's iconic cartoon, it's really no surprise that Tim Burton finally got around to making one. And, since it's a Tim Burton movie, it's no surprise that Johnny Depp takes the lead and Helena Bonham Carter plays the Queen of Hearts.When you scan the cast list, you might find some choices you think will be perfect and entertaining, like Alan Rickman as the Caterpillar, Stephen Fry as the Cheshire Cat, and Michael Sheen as the White Rabbit. Watching the movie proves to be an entirely different experience than the one you envisioned, since every single person in the movie seems to have been given the direction, 'Say your lines as differently from the Disney version as humanly possible.' Alan Rickman, with his beautifully famous voice, said his lines quickly and clipped. Not only was it not at all what audiences have come to associate with the Caterpillar, but it's a waste of his soothing, mimicable voice.Mia Wasikowska stars as Alice, and rather than playing the role as a curious little girl with an intricate imagination, she's a sullen teenager with a chip on her shoulder. Her lack of energy is a stark contrast to the rest of the vibrant film, and it doesn't mesh well. Johnny Depp is his usual ridiculous self, relying on makeup and weirdness to fool the audience into a state of admiration. Helena Bonham Carter takes a leaf from his book, thinking the audience will be so focused on her digitally altered head than her acting ability. In all the versions of Alice in Wonderland I've seen, I don't know if I've ever seen a more lackluster, disappointing Queen of Hearts.Some of you will love this version. The special effects and swirly, colorful Wonderland will make for a fun afternoon. I'll stick with Disney, or if I'm in the mood for real people, the 1933 version.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. This is Wonderland, so expect some swirling visuals and moving camera shots that will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",3,0,0,13 June 2019
Groundhog Day," An iconic masterpiece
","I'm pretty sure everyone in America has seen Groundhog Day, and that most of America watches it every year on the holiday itself. I'm included in the latter and have seen the movie over twenty times with my family. We eat Angel food cake, stuffing it in our mouths when Bill Murray does onscreen, and we drink sweet vermouth on the rocks with a twist. Even as kids, we drank bitters to pretend we could fit in with Andie MacDowell. We even have a relative who tried to calculate just how many Groundhog Days Bill lived through! Our family is hardly unique, and I'm sure millions of others enjoy the same ritual every February 2nd.Bill Murray will forever be immortalized in American cinema for his role as an unlikable, sarcastic, jaded weatherman assigned to the small town of Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania with his socially awkward cameraman, Chris Elliot, and his new, optimistic producer, Andie MacDowell, to cover the Groundhog Day festivities. I love this movie, but I would love it even more had Michael Keaton accepted the role, because in scenes where the character is supposed to show growth and new kindness, Bill's not particularly convincing. He is extremely convincing during most of the movie, when he's irritable, rude, and condescending. And, since this movie is a fantasy about living the same day over and over again with no consequences, it's cathartic for the audience to watch Bill's socially inacceptable behavior. How many times have we longed to tell off an irritating salesman? Bill gets to punch Stephen Tobolowsky in the face for us!There's so much to love about this movie, full of contrasts and imagination. Sweet Andie MacDowell is contrasted by Marita Geraghty's silliness. Everyone in the town takes themselves so seriously, providing the perfect surreal surrounding for Bill Murray's distaste. On the drive over, he insults the entire town, calling the residents 'hicks' and 'morons', setting the stage for a truly moving transformation. In Harold Ramis's iconic, inventive classic, audiences get to reappreciate small town charm, shrug off years of indifference and assumptions, learn to believe in love, and have faith in the belief that anyone can change. No matter how awful someone is, given several hundred second chances, he can change. And, in the ultimate lesson of optimism, even a simple bad day can turn into a lifechanging good one.",10,1,1,23 July 2019
The Great Raid," Authentic, patriotic, and incredibly moving
","It's very rare to make a modern movie about WWII and truly capture the feeling of the time period. Many post-1945 war movies couldn't get away from the 'We won!' relief and glossed over the intense fear and uncertainty that everyone around the world felt during the war. When you watch a movie that was made during the war years, you can smell the desperation from the actors and filmmakers. The Great Raid feels like it was made in the early '40s, but that the studio splurged on the budget and filmed it in Technicolor. The actors don't throw in any modern mannerisms, the camera doesn't use fancy tricks that remind the audience they're watching a movie, and the suspense is real. When the dangerous rescue mission is announced to the battalion, you fully expect several of the soldiers, if not everyone, to be killed. This is a war movie that doesn't gloat about the outcome but instead manages to instill the audience-who do know that the Allies eventually triumph-with enough uncertainty that it seems possible the war will not be won. With exception to the spurting blood when bullets were fired, I felt that I was watching a movie from 75 years ago.Given the title, and my lengthy introduction, I'm sure you can tell that the main plot of this movie is a rescue mission. In an incredibly moving opening sequence, James Franco narrates a bit of history to immerse the audience in the events leading up to the movie's exact timing, while real black-and-white footage of the war and POW camps is shown. When the modern actors take over, there's a very slow saturation of color into the film, and it perfectly slides the audience into the transition. We're introduced to an American training camp in the Pacific, led by Lt. Col. Benjamin Bratt, as well as some of the sickly prisoners in the camp to be raided, Joseph Fiennes and Martin Csokas. From my perspective, I was far more interested in the logistics of the raid, but I'm sure there are many audience members far more interested in the personal stories of the prisoners; the balance of screen time will please every viewer. As the film progresses, there's also a third subplot introduced and tied in: Connie Nielson is a nurse who risks her life to smuggle medicine into POW camps.John Dahl's direction is intense and subtle. He doesn't rely on handheld camera to build up tension, but instead lets the actors show how frightened they are without any added tricks. Rent any war movie from the first half of the 1940s-Gung Ho!, Wake Island, They Were Expendable, Objective, Burma!-and you'll understand that a camera can sit on a tripod and show the audience more tension than any spinning, shaking modern technique ever can. There's a great scene in which the battalion approaches a road through the tall weeds. Japanese tanks make for heavy traffic, and the soldiers are crouching in the weeds hoping they won't be seen. In another straightforward scene, the action speaks for itself: the Americans are advancing and waiting at night by a river at the bottom of a hill. Japanese troops are marching above them, and one soldier trots down the hill to refill his water canteen. Everything is still and quiet, letting the audience feel that they're hiding alongside the actors. I've seen too many modern movies that try to jazz things up for their viewers, but it's unnecessary.If you scan the cast list and aren't very impressed, rent this movie and get ready to change your mind. I was enormously impressed with everyone's performance. Joseph Fiennes isn't given much to do besides lay in his bed sick with malaria, but his illness is very convincing. Connie Nielson shows that even the tough risktakers can get terribly frightened. If you think James Franco is just pretty to look at, you'll be very surprised by this different role for him. He's the director of the raid, and in the buildup to his explanation, you can see the wheels turning in his head as he worries about his men and the likelihood that they'll be successful. When he finally does explain the plan and draws a diagram in the dirt, he's extremely clear and thorough. It's a wonderful scene. He outlines timing, platoon advances, backup squads in case of failure, and coordination of the entire battalion working off each other. The way he explains it is so vivid, the audience knows exactly what to expect and can follow along without any confusion when the time comes.And finally, there's the most impressive cast member of all, Benjamin Bratt. In silver screen films, many times the leading actors had fought in the war-Robert Montgomery, Clark Gable, Tyrone Power, Henry Fonda, Brian Donlevy, etc. Their experience not only drew audiences to the theaters, but it also showed on their faces that they'd seen the horrors of the battlefield. While there are less actors who are also veterans in modern cinema, many actors in military movies pretend to be tough rather than experienced. Benjamin Bratt was tough and experienced; it seemed like he'd been to war. He was constantly tired but didn't allow his energy to lag for the sake of the mission and his men. He may not have experienced that particular raid, but he'd lived through so many missions he knew he wouldn't run into anything he hadn't seen before. He'd said goodbye to his friends, he'd seen death come slowly and quickly, he'd killed, he'd seen plans go terribly wrong, he'd had to improvise, he'd been successful and regretful-and he was never given a monologue to tell the audience about his background. His eyes said it all.It's shameful that this movie was not only a box office bomb but panned by most critics. This is one of the great war movies of the modern era. I've read the criticism, and it was not only ridiculous but heartbreaking. Describing this movie as 'boring' and 'a noble failure' makes me wonder what movie these critics actually watched. The Great Raid is exciting and incredibly moving. It makes you proud that America fought in World War II.",10,3,3,16 February 2020
Beauty and the Beast," Yes, everyone else was disappointed, too
","Wasn't everyone looking forward to seeing the real people version of Beauty and the Beast? It was perfectly cast, with an actress who became famous for portraying an intelligent, feminist icon and who was actually a feminist icon who loved reading in real life, one of the most memorable faces from the hit tv show Downton Abbey, and a host of stars making up the highly coveted supporting roles. The special effects were touted, as were the promises that everything would look exactly like the cartoon-and yes, we all looked the other way and didn't mention the argument that if everything was going to be exactly the same, it didn't need to be made. Unfortunately, almost everyone who saw this movie was disappointed, and I was no exception. It did make for a fun parlor game afterwards: my family and I made a list of all the negative changes the 2017 version made to the 1991 original. We came up with 66.As fun as it would be to list them all, I'm not going to. You can rent it and make your own list with your friends or family. Plus, I don't like to be mean during my reviews, and I think I've been mean enough already. Obviously I recommend renting this real people adaptation, because it'll provide so much stimulating conversation afterwards, but try not to take it so personally. The vast majority of remakes try to put their own spin on the original; otherwise why remake it, right? Nobody is out to upset you with this movie: it's just not very good. But you will get to see some great special effects, and tons of familiar faces you know and love from other movies.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. During the 'Beauty and the Beast' dance number the camera swirls a bit, and that will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, the Beast is significantly scarier than in the cartoon, and he might scare your children, so I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",3,0,1,12 May 2020
Pulp Fiction," I didn't get the point
","I know I'm not the only one who doesn't like Pulp Fiction, even though I wasn't able to find any like-minded people at film school. It's just not my cup of tea: excessive language, excessive violence, cheesy dialogue, strange visuals, and a story that's meant to be a throwback to old pulp fiction novels of the 1950s. If that is your cup of tea, you might love it!Famous for John Travolta's comeback, Uma Thurman's dancing, and Samuel L. Jackson's monologue about his favorite Bible passage, it's a tongue-in-cheek action drama about two hitmen, one of which falls for their boss's wife. There's quite a bit more to the story to that, so don't throw anything at me for condensing it as such, but it's told so out of order, and the movie is so long, it was practically impossible for me to understand anything more than that. At nearly three hours, even though I watched the censored version on television, I didn't get much more out of the movie than a ton of violence and some terrible wigs. I don't know why the dance scene became so famous; to me it looked incredibly stupid. Again, don't throw anything at me, but I obviously didn't get the point.If you do want to give it a shot, you'll see a huge supporting cast of Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Harvey Keitel, Christopher Walken, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Rosanna Arquette, and Amanda Plummer. This is a highly acclaimed classic from the 1990s, but if you don't like it or don't even get all the way through it, you're not the only one.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",2,2,8,27 June 2019
"McFarland, USA"," Fantastic Must-See!
","The synopsis of this movie will probably make you think it's a cheesy Disney movie about a washed up teacher who makes a difference to his bad-boy students. It's not that movie. It's a fantastic, moving, inspiring tale that you'll want to buy and add to your collection.Kevin Costner plays a fired high school football coach with nowhere else to go but McFarland, USA, the poorest town in America in 1987. The kids there have no hope and no motivation, because before and after school they're out in tomato or lettuce fields helping their parents pick produce. They're not going to college; they'll become pickers when they graduate.Costner sees his kids running after school and comes up with the idea of creating a cross country team. With no funding, no support, and no clue what he's doing, he starts training the kids.The cross country portions of the film are exciting and fun to watch, but there's a lot more to this movie than the plot I just outlined. Costner and his family learn to make their new house their home, and this half of the film is interesting, tension-filled, and heartwarming. It's terribly sad to see the state of the town and how the poor residents survive, when the rest of America is thriving. Costner's character is unaware of their struggle when he first arrives, as most of the viewers will be, but as he gets to know his neighbors and bonds with the community, he (and we) are exposed to their cultural traditions.If you're not drawn to the movie because of the sports, or the inspirational story, or because you like true stories, or you like Kevin Costner, I'll give you one more reason to watch it: Maria Bello's costumes. I've never seen her look so pretty, and she wears the most darling outfits! But seriously, watch McFarland, USA. It's incredibly moving to watch how one teacher impacted a community and inspired a group of boys to look higher up than an agricultural field.",10,2,3,24 June 2017
Titanic," A beautiful recreation
","I have a personal reason for disliking the grand epic Titanic that swept eleven Academy Awards, but for the purposes of this review, I'll remain as impartial as possible. It won't do anyone any good to know that watching this film on the big screen as a child resulted in lifelong hydrophobia.From an artistic standpoint, this movie is flawless. The research and replication of the ill-fated RMS Titanic resulted in an identical duplication. Peter Lamont's production design, Michael Ford's set decoration, and Martin Laing and Charles Lee's art direction is breathtaking. If you spend the entire three hours starting at minute details like dishes, wallpaper, and chandeliers, you'll feel like you're really aboard the ship. The beautiful fashions, designed by Deborah Lynn Scott, are authentic looking and gorgeous. Most of the movie is very beautiful to watch, including the famous dissolve from ruin to reconstruction in the beginning.This wasn't the first movie about the Titanic, and this version's storyline isn't very interesting. Kate Winslet stars as a high-class lady travelling with her mother, Frances Fisher, and her fiancé, Billy Zane. She meets a low-class American, Leonardo DiCaprio, who won his passage in a card game, and he shows her how to really live and fall in love. Parts of the story are rather weak and feel like they belong in a Disney movie rather than a dramatic epic, but I'm sure the love story will please young-minded teenagers.The beginning of the film recreates finding the remnants of the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean, and a very old woman, Gloria Stuart, tells her memory of the voyage. There are a few cuts back and forth from Gloria's story to the 1912 timeline, but once the iceberg is hit, the rest of the film is shown in real-time, which is an interesting touch and a great feat accomplished by director James Cameron and his co-editors Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris. However, during the last portion of the film, there are a few flaws that aren't hard to catch, the most obvious being a lack of foam in the seawater. The literally freezing water doesn't make anyone's teeth chatter until they're submerged, but if enclosed in iceberg-infested waters up to one's thighs, symptoms of the cold would absolutely be seen. In a romantic gesture, Kate Winslet is seen trudging her way through the water in her extremely heavy petticoats, but she wouldn't have been able to move so quickly if her legs were being frozen and the weight of her thick dress material were added to the mix.So, depending on your point of view, you can fall in love with this beautiful splendor, full of iconic moments and a memorable theme and song. You can lose yourself in the historical replications or spend your time searching for flaws, which you'll find. I won't ever watch the movie again, but let me know what you think!Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since there are scary situations that scarred me for life, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",3,2,9,6 June 2019
Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," There's nothing like the first
","There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the 'magical' qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as 'guest stars' but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word 'earwax' to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as 'Maggie Smith cats', mumble 'Shouldn't have said that,' when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name 'Fluffy,' chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie.",10,9,9,17 June 2019
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire," The first of the dark ones
","So far, in the wizarding world of Hogwarts, an evil wizard has tried to kill children, an escaped convict has snuck on campus undetected, three teachers have been fired from the same position, a giant snake attacked people, and the harmless school sport has resulted in serious injuries that couldn't instantly be fixed by magic and required an extended stay in the hospital. Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire came out in theaters. Folks, if you thought the first three films were as dark as you'd like a children's movie to be, turn back now. The fourth story is very dark, and the series only gets darker from here on out.Those of you who have decided to brave the fourth Harry Potter movie will be treated to a brand new event: the Tri-Wizard Tournament. In this new plot point never mentioned in the previous books or movies, two other wizarding schools from France and Russia travel to Hogwarts to compete in an enormously dangerous series of contests with hopes of taking a trophy back home. Why would anyone do that? Brave, and arguably stupid, contestants are supposed to write their names down on a piece of paper, stick it in the titular goblet, and then get selected by the goblet to be their school's one and only representative. France chooses Clémence Poésy, Russia chooses Stanislav Yanevski, and Hogwarts chooses a pre-Twilight, very handsome Robert Pattison. Of course, since this is a Harry Potter movie, the goblet spews out a fourth name and orders that Harry become a fourth contestant, even though he was too young to be allowed to put his name in. Headmaster Michael Gambon declares that they have to follow the rules and let Harry risk his life; yes, yes, the plot itself makes no sense, but if you're sitting down to watch it, you'll just have to accept that.So, as Harry prepares for the contest, his fellow fourteen-year-old students all discover their hormones. The school also hosts a ball during the tournament, and as Maggie Smith brings out a record player and teaches her students how to waltz-yes, yes, this makes no sense-all the young boys and girls giggle and blush and try their very awkward hands at flirting. The moment everyone's been waiting for finally arrives, and Emma Watson gives herself a makeover. No one knew at the time she was cast four years earlier that she'd grow up to be a knock-out, but thankfully, when she makes her grand entrance, no one has to pretend to drop his jaw.The new teacher this year is Brendan Gleeson, and while his very creepy appearance is unsettling, it's not nearly as unsettling as the direction the plot takes. You can tell from the nearly constant fog and dark color scheme of the film that it's going to be heavy, and even with the comic relief thrown in about the dance, it's not an uplifting movie. At the beginning, Harry attends a Quidditch game with the lovable Weasley family, but the fun is quickly cut short by a host of bad guys. The steadfast friendship between Ron and Harry gets interrupted by jealousy, and both boys spend the entire movie in dire need of a haircut. A harmless visit to Hagrid's hut winds up being a site-seeing tour of dangerous dragons, and opening what looks like a Fabergé egg results in an ear-splitting noise. Everything in this movie is far darker than it first appears to be, from the littlest details to the grand contest itself.To keep you occupied during the very long movie that's sorely missing John Williams's iconic music, you'll still see all the old standbys: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Tom Felton, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Mark Williams, Warwick Davis, the new regular Michael Gambon, and a repeat appearance by Shirley Henderson. A few new faces make an appearance in this movie, Katie Leung as Harry's love interest Cho Chang, Gary Oldman, David Tennant, Timothy Spall, Miranda Richardson, and Ralph Fiennes.One of the great things about the Harry Potter movies was that an entire generation of kids got to grow up at the same time the actors did, and when upsetting things happened, they felt better prepared to handle watching it since the actors were watching the same things. A good rule of thumb is if you're watching these movies with kids who are younger than the actors, either make them wait a year or two or give them a warning that something bad or scary is going to happen.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to scary scenes involving children, I'd wait until my kids were pre-teens before letting them watch it.",6,0,2,17 June 2019
The Untouchables," Really boring
","Alright, The Untouchables is a famous movie. You should probably go see it. But if you're a girl, you probably won't like it.This is a total man's man movie, so it's only fitting that Kevin Costner, Sean Connery, and Robert De Niro are the stars. I don't even think there's any women in the movie; if there are, my apologies, but they're obviously forgettable. It's got action, cops and crooks, and suspense, so it's a must-see for manly men.The Untouchables is about a bunch of special agents trying to arrest and capture famous gangster Al Capone. Don't throw anything at me, but despite the historical setting, I was incredibly bored during this movie. I was so bored, I actually fast-forwarded some scenes. It was still a very long two hours. But it is pretty famous, and Sean Connery won an Oscar for it, so you might want to see it just to say you did.",2,1,12,20 June 2017
The Godfather: Part III," Does anybody care about all these new faces?
","Was it supposed to be funny that the main storyline in The Godfather: Part III took 'keep it in the family' to an entirely new level? It's a love story between Andy Garcia and Sofia Coppola, who play first cousins. Andy is James Caan's son, and Sofia is Al Pacino's daughter. Does anyone really care about these people, or would you rather send them to a therapist and save yourself three hours? Since only three of the original cast has made it to the last installment, Al Pacino, Diane Keaton, and Talia Shire, the movie banks on audiences caring about all the new faces and plot points. Instead of all the old faithfuls from the 1970s, there's Andy Garcia, Sofia Coppola, George Hamilton, Joe Mantegna, Bridget Fonda, and Eli Wallach. It doesn't really feel like as much of a classic, does it?In this one, you can look forward to tons of violence, lots of new faces, old grudges, and the infamous-and once again, continually spoofed-silent scream from Al Pacino. Maybe the only reason why The Godfather franchise is so famous is because people keep making fun of them and mimicking them-or maybe that's just wishful thinking on my part. I didn't enjoy these movies, even though I watched it with my own family, most of whom are Sicilian. At least I didn't watch this last one with any cousins.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",1,6,11,31 January 2019
Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets," Another year and more wizarding adventures
","Since the world has already been introduced to the wonderful wizarding world of Harry Potter and Hogwarts, and since all the major characters have all been introduced, what else is there to do to make the other movies special? In the second installment, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton all return to their magical school for another year. Somehow, even though they were all placed in a great deal of danger the previous school year, no one expects anything bad might happen. Bad things do happen, and even though the school is host to a staff of enormously competent and powerful wizards and witches, the little children find it's up to them to save the day! It's quite an accomplishment for the three heroes, since there's an army of giant spiders living in the forest, a mysterious villain lurking in the halls who literally petrifies its victims, and a magical diary with its own hidden agenda. Get ready to cut young Harry Potter some slack and keep in mind that he's only twelve years old and liable to make some pretty big mistakes; if you found a talking diary, would you confide in it?Ironically, the second novel was my favorite of the series, but I don't watch the second film very often. The most memorable part of this installment-even more than the famous diary-is the arrival of Dobby the House Elf. While the little kiddies might be endlessly entertained by his scenes, I couldn't get past his squeaky voice. He's written that way in the book, but imagining his voice and having to sit through it in a movie are two different things. Probably the third most memorable part of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets can be summed up by Rupert Grint's line: 'Follow the spiders? Why couldn't he have said, 'Follow the butterflies?'' Anyone out there who's afraid of spiders, let alone allergic to their bites, probably won't want to watch this movie very often either. When doing a marathon, as I recently did with my nieces, it's just blasphemous to skip any of the films, so you'll have to just close your eyes or use the spider scene as a popcorn break.There are some fun parts to this movie, though, so when you're watching a marathon with your nieces, you'll be able to have fun once you return from getting more popcorn. Kenneth Branagh 'guest stars' as a hilariously conceited and incompetent new teacher who has girls swooning at every turn. John Williams's beautiful music is still used, and the new themes he wrote for the second movie are just as lovely as in the original. The kids decide to go undercover by making a magic potion that turns their appearance into whoever they've stolen a hair from, and Emma Watson's potion backfires with a pinch of cat hair. And don't forget, this is the movie with the flying car! With all that to focus on, who cares about a few spiders and a squeaky voice?Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to an upsetting scene involving an animal as well as scary scenes involving spiders and snakes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",8,0,0,17 June 2019
Die Hard," Iconic action classic
","Is there anyone out there who hasn't seen Die Hard? It's an American staple in the universally loved genre of action movies, so unless you really don't like them, you've probably seen it. I'll tell you a secret: I fell asleep the first time I watched it. Thanks to the magical DVD player and the boxed set of Die Hard DVDs my dad bought, there've been ample opportunities to rectify my mistake and watch the movie again.In this Bruce Willis classic, action, tense drama, comedic one-liners, and Christmas are all mixed together to make a winning combination. Walking barefoot on broken glass might not be the type of scene you want to watch him in during the holidays, but Die Hard has been added to many people's Christmas movie traditions. He plays the iconic policeman John McLane-with an iconic catchphrase that isn't appropriate to write out or say in front of children-who, on Christmas Eve, winds up fighting the scary Alan Rickman, a German terrorist who takes a building full of people hostage, instead of reconciling with his wife, which was his original plan for the evening.Sometimes the old action flicks wind up becoming cheesy over time. While I'm not one to call 1988 an ancient time, this movie has had time to settle, and even among the young, impatient audiences of today, it's still enjoyed and entertaining. When James Shigeta says, 'You'll just have to kill me,' he's not saying anything new; hostages have always whimpered to villains that they don't have the needed information, and the villains always shrug and let them live. In Die Hard, Alan Rickman shrugs and follows James's suggestion. It's iconic, funny, terrible, and makes Alan both a wonderful and frightening villain. Get ready to start quoting both the hero and the villain, and you're guaranteed to have a 'yippe ki-yay' of a good time.",7,0,0,16 June 2019
Rosemary's Baby," Horror classic
","After starring in the Peyton Place television series and making all of America believe she was as sweet, innocent, and well-rounded as Allison MacKenzie, Mia Farrow showed an entirely new side of her when she starred in the horror classic Rosemary's Baby. There's an abundance of trivia you can read up on—from how many actresses were up for the part to the infamous divorce papers served to Mia while on the set—which might be even more famous than the film itself.Well, probably not. Rosemary's Baby is incredibly famous, and not just for sullying Mia Farrow's screen innocence. She and her screen husband John Cassavetes move into an apartment and subsequently make friends with their neighbors, Ruth Gordon and Sidney Blackmer. Strange things start happening to the young couple and those around them, but by the time Mia figures it out, it might be too late. . . While there's an arguably slow beginning, you can tell there's a sense of dread in the air, and once the scary parts start, you're buckled in for a non-stop horror fest until the end.If you like horror movies, you might not be very fazed by this one. But keep in mind, in 1968, Rosemary's Baby was a really big deal. For lightweights, like me, you'll be really spooked by this cult favorite. I only sat through this one because I like Mia Farrow so much.Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, this is a horror movie and way too scary for kids, Also, there may or may not be a rape scene, so I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",5,2,10,18 September 2017
The Holiday," Delightful romantic masterpiece
","Writer-director Nancy Myers has created a modern masterpiece in the delightful romance The Holiday. Not only are there extremely likable characters, a storyline that belongs in a fairytale book, fun and fitting music, great performances, and relationships that make us believe in love again, but it takes place at Christmastime! Everything's better at Christmas—how many terrible movies have we all sat through just because they take place in December?—and you can now add a modern classic to your box of black-and-white films you watch every holiday season.Kate Winslet opens the film with a poignant narration about the different types of love, and a montage overlay introduces us to all the characters in the film. Then we see Kate at her office Christmas party, pining away for her former lover, Rufus Sewell. If there's a woman in the audience who doesn't swallow a lump in her throat inspired by their rapport together, that woman should turn off the film and only resume it after she's had her heart broken. The dialogue is so realistic it's painful, and Kate's expressions are absolutely perfect.Next, we meet Cameron Diaz, who's having a terrible fight with her boyfriend, Edward Burns. It's a wonderful introduction to her character as well, because even though she appears to be tough and not as sensitive as Kate Winslet, we see subtleties that indicate she has deep feelings in her she's been repressing for a long time.Without describing every single scene—which I could absolutely do, since I've seen this movie close to a hundred times—I'll get to the main plot. Kate and Cameron swap houses for the Christmas holiday, taking spontaneous vacations from their lives and getting a second chance when they need it the most. Kate is awed by Los Angeles and the sunshine, and she meets new friends Eli Wallach and Jack Black, both in the film industry. Cameron is a little frustrated by the snow and English countryside, but when Jude Law turns up on her doorstep—literally—she remembers what vacations are for.One remarkable thing about this movie is it manages to take three actors, whom I normally dislike so much so that I try to avoid their movies, and completely change my mind about them. With the exception of the film Carnage, which I hadn't seen until years later, I've usually found Kate Winslet's acting style irritating. At the time of its release, The Holiday was the best acting she'd ever done. She's the heart of the movie, and through her moving performance, women everywhere will believe they'll survive after their heart's been broken. I'm the first to admit that my animosity towards Cameron Diaz had everything to do with her similarity to a rival in high school, but when I watched The Holiday, I completely forgot about the teenager who tried to steal my sweetheart. Cameron shows off her acting chops in this film, and as her character grows, she helps the audience vicariously grow. Jude Law, while normally drawn to upsetting roles, plays a character who should have been named 'Every Woman's Fantasy.' Everything you ever wanted in a man, but deep down know you'll never get, is represented by Jude in this film. If you don't develop a massive crush on him, you must have very bad taste. Plus, he's very believable when he speaks his unbelievable lines, which is a testament to his acting.I've always liked Jack Black, so while The Holiday didn't change my mind about him, it did show me another side to his acting. He's extremely convincing as an L.A. Hollywood type, and the mixture of his confidence and uncertainty adds another layer to his character. Eli Wallach, at ninety years old, still has a wonderful screen presence. His scenes are some of the most touching, and the film wouldn't be the same without him.The dual-settings of the film provide an ideal Christmas for everyone in the audience, so whether you like the sun or the snow, you'll be happy. Hans Zimmer's music, to quote Jack Black in the film, is 'very unexpected', and it adds to the delight of the film, making it clear that someone should snatch up the rights and turn this into a Broadway musical! I absolutely love every part of this movie. It's funny, charming, sad, realistic, inspiring, heartwarming, and irresistible. It's simply wonderful, no matter what time of year you watch it.DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, there's one tiny part of the movie in which the camera spins in a circle. After Jack Black and Kate Winslet sing 'Arthur is a doodle-y-doo' on the piano, look away for about ten seconds. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",10,6,7,11 December 2017
Steve Jobs," Seems like you're watching a play
","If you're looking for a flattering depiction of Steve Jobs, this 2015 biopic isn't it. Starring Michael Fassbender, and costarring Kate Winslet as his overworked assistant and Seth Rogen as his former business partner, the film paints Jobs out to be demanding, distant, unreasonable, and cruel. I watched this movie with my dad, and he'd just finished reading Walter Isaacson's biography on which the film was based. He said there were obvious parallels from the written words to the film, so those of you who read that biography might be interested in renting the movie.To me, the film reeked of the theater. If I hadn't watched it with my dad, I could have sworn Aaron Sorkin's screenplay had been based off of a play rather than a book. It's separated into three sections, or acts, and it could have easily been performed on a stage. Each act takes place backstage before an event, and as Steve prepares to make his big speech, the same few people come into his life with the same problems. It has a very symbolic feeling, showing that as time passes, a man can outwardly progress and yet stay stuck within himself.There's an overwhelming dizzying effect by director Danny Boyle to try and show audiences Jobs's mindset, as well as a purposely irritating score written by Daniel Pemberton, to remind audiences that when he least needs chaos, chaos finds him. I didn't end up enjoying this movie, because the protagonist was so unlikable and the theater-esque setting felt a little pretentious, but Michael Fassbender and Kate Winslet's performances were worth watching. I barely recognized Kate, and Michael's constant energy was as exhausting as it needed to be.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. During almost the entire movie, there are either ancillary images floating in the background or a fluid camera movement that will make you very sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",5,2,4,6 June 2019
Love Actually," Guarunteed to win at Christmastime
","I'm probably the only person in the world who didn't want to immediately return to the movie theaters and watch Love Actually again and again when it came out. With a huge cast, a Christmas setting, and tiny romantic vignettes that are unrealistically optimistic and allow for very little character development, it's a cinch that this movie would be beloved by all. There are so many storylines, you're bound to find someone you like, and there's probably someone in the cast that drew you to the movie theaters in the first place. And since it's Christmas, everyone likes movies with happy endings. I'll stick with my Hallmark marathon, but if you love this movie, you're in good company with millions of others.Bill Nighy plays a burnt out pop singer turning his hit song into a Christmas song, which we're treated to about a dozen times throughout the movie. He's alone during the holidays, but he does have a steadfast friend in his manager, Gregor Fisher. Liam Neeson is a widower whose extremely young son believes he's fallen in love with a classmate who's moving. Rather than sitting the infant down and explaining that he'll experience exactly the same feeling with another classmate the next term, Liam tells his son that love is the most important thing in the world, and he has to declare his feelings before the girl leaves town. I know it's supposed to be heartwarming, but Thomas Sangster is in middle school! It left my eyes dry. Hugh Grant is the British Prime Minister, and while he's bored to tears dealing with the American president, Billy Bob Thornton, his wandering eye catches a lowly maid, Martine McCutcheon. This vignette is intended to inspire a belief that true love conquers any social, economic, and class boundary. First of all, that's not the case, and second of all, if it didn't work for me in Cinderella, Love Actually isn't going to change my mind.Next up is Alan Rickman, a hardworking businessman with very little happiness in his life. Sparks fly with his secretary Heike Makatsch, but since her hair and makeup reek of 'fun fling' and his wife Emma Thompson is given a tearjerker scene to get the audience on her side, you can bet your bottom dollar he's spending Christmas at home. I was rooting for Heike to make Alan happy, so without giving definitive spoilers, let's go to the next vignette. Colin Firth takes a vacation for Christmas after getting dumped, and completely on the rebound, he falls in love with Lucia Moniz. He speaks no Portuguese, and she speaks no English. Again, this is supposed to be charming and sweet.Laura Linney gives American audiences someone without an accent to root for, and as she has a crush on the hunk at the office, Rodrigo Santoro, her romantic life has always taken a backseat to her on-call care for her mentally-off brother. Do you think the office Christmas party might give her a break? Once again, we have another plot point that doesn't think any further than the morning after. Martin Freeman and Joanna Page are given what's probably supposed to be the funniest segment. They're body doubles who spend their days on a film set acting in sex scenes, but they're both incredibly polite and shy. Rowan Atkinson has a small but important role in other people's vignettes, but isn't given a romance.And finally, we have the most famous segment: Andrew Lincoln holding up signs outside Keira Knightley's house telling her he loves her. Why is this romantic when her husband is his best friend, Chiwetel Ejiofor? Why is this teaching people good things, that 'at Christmas, we tell the truth' when on an earlier sign, he told Keira to lie to her husband and pretend Christmas carolers had rung the doorbell? And what will happen the day after Christmas? Why are we supposed to root for this vein of infidelity when we were supposed to root against Alan Rickman's office affair?As you can guess, I didn't add this movie to my Christmas collection. If you've never seen it, and my arguments make sense to you, you might want to skip it. If you've seen it and love it, you probably haven't made it this far in my review.",4,0,1,18 June 2019
To Kill a Mockingbird," 'Do you know what a compromise is?'
","To Kill a Mockingbird is pretty famous in my household. My mom loved Gregory Peck's portrayal of the integrity-filled, honest, caring, patient father so much that she named my brother Atticus. It was a running quotation when I was growing up to say, 'Do you know what a compromise is?' with a little Southern drawl. I know my family is one of millions who have tried to emulate Gregory Peck's clipped pronunciation of 'Scout'; that one word is another one of our famous and long-running movie quotations.Unfortunately, there's nothing more American than racism, and in this adaptation of one of the most iconic American novels, lawyer Atticus Finch defends a black man falsely accused of raping a white woman. Since it's the South, you can only imagine the backlash he and his family receive from the community when he steps up to give Tom Robinson his right to a fair trial. As in the novel, the story is told from the point of view of Scout, Atticus's young daughter. Mary Badham plays Scout, and she's not only adorable, but completely earned her Oscar nomination. She was only ten years old, and the youngest actress to be nominated at that time! To Kill a Mockingbird marks Gregory Peck's most famous role, and while everyone knows the famous 'In the name of God' powerful courtroom speech, his performance isn't just a 'Gregory Peck role'. He's a caring, concerned father, and the scenes between Greg and Mary are beautiful. Greg won an Oscar for his performance, and the film also picked up statues for Adapted Screenplay and Art Direction. Elmer Bernstein's lovely theme was nominated, but it was hard to compete against Laurence of Arabia, which took the music, director, and picture awards away from To Kill a Mockingbird. This is a real American classic, so if you're that one person in the country who hasn't yet seen it, rent it so you can join in the conversation with all your family and friends. Even if you're particularly attached to the novel and don't generally like film adaptations, give it a chance. Harper Lee herself loved the movie and thought Gregory Peck's performance was so wonderful, she gave him her father's (the real Atticus Finch) pocket watch. Peck's grandson is named Harper, which is really sweet, and it shows just how much this role and film meant to him and his family.",7,2,3,10 August 2017
The Bridge on the River Kwai," Famous but not necessarily amazing
","There are two parts of The Bridge on the River Kwai most audiences take away after watching it: the music and the famous scene in the end, which I won't describe for sake of spoilers. In the two-and-a-half hour movie, there's actually a lot more that happens than whistling the 'Colonel Bogey March' and the ending. This is a pretty tense war movie involving prisoners of war and their quest to break free and continue to fight against the Japanese in WWII. William Holden stars, with Alec Guinness and Jack Hawkins as the other main 'good guy' soldiers, and Sessue Hayakawa as the head of the Japanese POW camp. If you remember Sessue from Three Came Home, you know that he brings a lot of depth to his roles.Alec Guinness won the Academy Award for Best Actor, even though he wasn't really the lead. He happens to be instrumental in the most memorable scene of the movie, but that has no bearing on the wrong category of his award. He also didn't 'own' the role as many actors who give award-worthy performances do. Any number of actors could have played his part in this movie and done just as competent a performance; my choice would have been David Niven. He would have owned the role, and he would have actually deserved a nomination, if not a win.Still, this is a pretty famous movie to come out of the 1950s, so if you like to study cinema from that time period, you'll probably want to watch it. More likely than not, if you've seen a lot of other classic war films, you won't be that impressed by this one.",5,1,2,3 November 2018
The Reader," Weak script, strong acting
","If you're a fan of Kate Winslet and want to watch the film that won her her Oscar, and you're old enough to handle some very uncomfortable sex scenes, go out and rent The Reader. If you're not old enough, or you prefer well-acted movies where everyone keeps his and her clothes on, rent Labor Day instead for a great Kate Winslet performance.David Kross stars as a fifteen-year-old boy in post-war Germany who enters into a relationship with the much older, mysterious Kate Winslet after a chance encounter. While it's very clear that David's interest is solely the interest of any hormone-raging teenager who gets within a three-foot radius of any woman, it never explains Kate's interest. On a physical level, why is she attracted to someone who, five years earlier, was in grade school? On an emotional level, why does she want to permanently damage a young boy's mind and future relationships? In their meet-cute, she helps walk him home after he's ill on the street. Leading up to their first explicit encounter, he helps her with a chore and gets his face dirty; she insists he take off all his clothes and have a bath. The set-up makes no sense, and if you're looking at the film through a lens concerned with child abuse, Kate is clearly guilty.A good portion of the movie details Kate and David's sexual relationship, but as the film starts with Ralph Fiennes reflecting on his youth, the audience is left to hope there's a little more to the story. The plot does progress, and if you look up the film online you'll find out what happens in the first sentence of description. If you want to be surprised, just rent the movie without knowing anything about it.While the performances of the lead actors are very good, the script is surprisingly weak. There's a shocking lack of character development than not only leaves the audiences wondering why they made their choices, but makes the main points of the plot unbelievable. I can only imagine Kate Winslet working through her script, exclaiming, 'She does what? But why?' with no one to help her. Given what she had to work with, she did a very good job.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic nudity, graphic sex scenes, and uncomfortable scenes involving a young boy, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",5,0,1,10 June 2019
Inception," Not as complicated as it seems
","Famous for a script that was so complicated even the actors themselves didn't understand what was going on, Inception is one of Christopher Nolan's most famous films, which, given his string of popular movies, is saying something. It's a science fiction film that takes dream analysis to several new levels. In the film, it's Leonardo DiCaprio's job to put his clients to sleep, then enter their dream subconscious and find out information they need. It gets much more complicated, but for the sake of saving your brain, that's the plot in a nutshell.Nolan recruited an all-star supporting cast, including Michael Caine, Marion Cotillard, Ellen Page, Cillian Murphy, Tom Hardy, Ken Watanabe, Tom Berenger, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, in one of his first dramatic roles. While everyone tries very hard to give serious, dramatic performances to thrill and move the audience, it doesn't always come across that way. Marion seems like she's trying to remember how to speak English, Joe seems like he's desperately trying to get the audience to forget he was ever in 3rd Rock from the Sun, and Leo looks like he's out of tears and thinks a wrinkled face will be just as convincing.The special effects of the film absolutely deserved the hype and the Academy Award, as scenes literally bend and crumble into one another as the different dream sequences blend. If you love movies with incredible special effects, this is a must-see.If you even mention the title to anyone who's seen it, it'll no doubt spark an hour long discussion about what the story and ending meant. I watched the film, and with the exception of a couple of little details during the dream-within-a-dream sequences, I understood it perfectly. To me, the ending was not one that needed discussion, so I don't quite understand the reason behind everyone's endless debates. However, if that type of story intrigues you, you might want to watch this one with your friends so you can stay up late afterwards and talk about what you think it meant.",4,1,1,29 November 2017
Sherlock Holmes," A little too modern
","While there have been countless film and television portrayals of Sherlock Holmes and his assistant Dr. Watson, the whodunnit genre is never one that audiences tire of, so why not continue to make them? Robert Downey Jr. stars as the famed literary detective, with Jude Law at his side. When I first heard of this film's production, I learned the cast and thought, 'Oh, Jude Law will make a great Sherlock Holmes!' But, as is sometimes the case, Michael Robert Johnson, Anthony Peckham, and Simon Kinberg's script wrote Holmes to be the eccentric one with Watson as the straight man. Thus, Jude Law took second billing and saved his talent for later.Robert Downey Jr. already proved his flawless British accent in Chaplin, so it's no stretch to see him blend into his surroundings. However, he's one of those love-him-or-leave-him actors, and this movie probably won't change the opinion you already have of him. If you think he's talented, handsome, and funny, you'll like Sherlock Holmes. If you think he's overrated and emits an ego larger than his talent, you won't like it.Director Guy Ritchie added an extra technical difference to his film, one that's also a love-it-or-leave-it feature. In the many action scenes throughout the film-this isn't a wordy mystery, it's an action-comedy-the footage is slowed down at random moments, showing details that would normally be impossible to spot. Someone throws a punch, and the camera shows the ripple of skin when contact is made, the expectorate from the injured man's mouth, and the low groan of pain to coincide with the slowed down footage. I found it a little too modern and jarring; I would have preferred every aspect to fit with the time period.",4,1,1,13 December 2017
Stalag 17," Mediocre POW flick
","Stalag 17, like lots of other movies who have won veteran actors an Oscar, is a completely forgettable movie that would be looked at as mediocre at best if not for the simple fact that it won a veteran actor an Oscar. Would Butterfield 8 be famous if Elizabeth Taylor didn't win an Oscar? How about Lilies of the Field? Probably not, and neither would Stalag 17.In a prisoner-of-war camp, William Holden, Robert Strauss, Harvey Lembeck, Richard Erdman, Peter Graves and others are stuck together, none of them outranking each other, and each suspecting the other of cooperating with the enemy. Their German captors are getting leaked information about planned escapes; who is the mole? You'll have to rent this one to find out, and also to find out if they wind up with a successful escape plan. Personally, this isn't the best escape-from-prison flick, nor is it the best POW camp flick, nor is it the best William Holden flick. If you want to see him in a war movie, you've got two other good choices: The Bridges of Toko-Ri and The Bridge Over the River Kwai.",2,1,5,11 November 2018
The Terminal," A few laughs, but not really a feel-good flick
","The preview of The Terminal is a pretty good representation of the film, which isn't always the case with modern trailers. Tom Hanks plays a man from Krakozhia, visiting the United States for the first time. He arrives in New York City, but before he gets through immigration he runs into a pretty major problem. Stanley Tucci, the customs director, informs him that his government is going through a crisis and he isn't allowed to enter the United States. He's also not allowed to be shipped home, so he's stuck in 'the terminal' until his country stabilizes. He meets a host of airport workers who have a host of quirky traits, and he also becomes attracted to stewardess Catherine Zeta-Jones. And, as you can see from the preview, there are a few laughs, some good acting from an accented and utterly foreign Tom Hanks, some cute scenes, but it won't end up being your favorite movie in the world.My biggest problem with the film are the minor characters. Kumar Pallana, a janitor, is extremely irritating. His character is written to have a major attitude problem and to be intentionally mean, for no reason except to exact a frustrated chuckle from the audience. Diego Luna and Zoe Saldana have an awkward romance that isn't the most amusing part of the plot. Catherine Zeta-Jones, while written realistically, isn't a very nice person and reminds audiences of that one person in their circle of friends who makes endless mistakes but is tolerated because of her beauty.Basically, if you're a Tom Hanks fan, or a Steven Spielberg fan, or a John Williams fan, you'll probably want to see it. But it's not exactly the feel-good movie that you think it will be. There's a big mystery in the plot and once it's revealed, you might feel a bit let down. Having said that, I do own a copy, since there are some cute scenes. My favorite is Tom Hanks's preparation of asking Catherine Zeta-Jones out on a date, or as he says it, to 'eat a bite'. He's a cutie!",7,0,0,28 December 2017
Paths of Glory," Riveting and well-acted
","If you liked All Quiet on the Western Front, you'll love Paths of Glory. Told in the same anti-war tone, Stanley Kubrick's film conveys a stark, bleak atmosphere in his black-and-white footage, Georg Krause's stoic cinematography, and Malcom Arnold's minimalistic score. It follows the planning and potential execution of a suicide mission in World War One. If you can use your suspension of disbelief and accept the fact that no one in the movie has a French accent, you'll be in for a very riveting, well-acted film.Adolphe Menjou and George Macready are big-wigs in the French army, and they plan out a mission for their boys in the trenches that has virtually no likelihood of success. Both men are hard-hearted and treat men in uniform like chess pawns. Emotional and physical wounds are often ignored, but when Kirk Douglas hears of the plan, he doesn't want to go through with it. He actually cares about his soldiers and doesn't want to order them to their death. Keep in mind that this is a war drama, so don't pop this in if you're in the mood for a light afternoon flick. This movie will absolutely get you riled up, and if you're already anti-war, it might become one of your favorites. It had the misfortune to be released the same year as The Bridge on the River Kwai, which swept the Oscars in 1958 and took space in audiences' memories in the years to come. You've probably heard of Paths of Glory, but unless you're a film buff or student, you might not have seen it. If you're up for a very heavy, depressing movie, it's absolutely worth watching.",7,1,2,18 January 2018
The Iron Giant," Great cartoon for children
","A little boy makes friends with a robot, insisting he's gentle even when the government suggests he's armed and dangerous. Although it doesn't sound like a normal premise for a children's cartoon, The Iron Giant is actually really delightful for kids and parents alike.Cartoons nowadays are sometimes just flashy and noisy, and absolutely torturous for parents to watch. And you'll be hard pressed to find one that actually teaches kids good lessons! The Iron Giant teaches good things. I won't spoil any plot points, but trust me, the lessons are ones you'll want your kids to learn. The last portion of the movie does have some violence, but compared to the loud, flashy scenes of today's movies, it's nothing your kids haven't seen before. And the animation is regular 2-D style, which I believe is better for kids' brains and developing attention spans anyway. When I watch a cartoon, I like it to look drawn by a person, not by a computer.If you particularly want your children to be shielded from on screen violence, you can wait until your kids are a little older. Otherwise, it's a really great movie to watch with your sons and daughters!",7,1,3,12 June 2017
Any Given Sunday," This movie takes itself seriously
","The promotional poster for Any Given Sunday is priceless. Al Pacino is shown mid-shout, Cameron Diaz is trying to look sultry, James Woods looks like he's given so many promo pictures he's forgotten which movie this one's for, and Dennis Quaid and Jamie Foxx look like they're trying to be taken seriously. Add in tons of football, and you've got the entire movie in a nutshell.If you don't like football, you're not going to like this movie. Since most Americans do like football, it's no wonder this was a successful film. Cameron Diaz tries to be taken seriously as a football team owner, and she and Al Pacino, the coach, continually clash on how to handle the team. For example, when player Dennis Quaid gets injured, Al sticks by him, but Cameron quickly replaces him with the inexperienced Jamie Foxx. Fans of Dennis in Everybody's All American will like seeing him back in the football setting ten years later, especially since this movie could be seen as a partial extension from the 1988 classic.Keep in mind when you're deciding whether or not to rent it that this is an Oliver Stone movie. This isn't a feel-good football flick, nor is it something you can tune out during and not be lost. This is fast-paced and takes itself extremely seriously, as if the subject and storylines are the most important problems in the entire world and if you aren't entirely invested, you aren't entirely alive. If you decide you're in the mood for that, get ready to see a host of familiar faces, including Aaron Eckhart, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, LL Cool J, Matthew Modine, John C. McGinley, and Charlton Heston in a cameo. Football isn't my life, even though I did enjoy playing it in school, so this isn't my favorite movie. I just can't seem to take Cameron Diaz seriously, so the premise of the film isn't believable.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to language and graphic nudity, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",2,1,2,24 January 2019
Bruce Almighty," Jim Carrey's last hit
","Bruce Almighty had such a promising premise: a man, disillusioned with God, suddenly meets The Man is given his powers. Prayers come in to Bruce, and he has 'almighty' power to do whatever he wants, which, since this is a comedy, includes adjusting his girlfriend's breast size and destroying a co-worker's career.This movie marked the last Jim Carrey movie that most people saw in the theaters. After this came his dramatic turn in Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the quirky, hard-to-market A Series of Unfortunate Events, and finally the less-than-stellar remake of Fun with Dick and Jane. So, if you're an old-school Carrey fan and want to see his last hit, you can rent this one. It does have a few funny gags in it, but it's easy and sad to tell he's on the decline.",5,1,2,12 June 2017
La Vie En Rose," Marion Cottilard's flawless portrayal
","For French audiences, no introduction is necessary to the film La Vie en Rose, the biopic of 'The Little Sparrow', Edith Piaf. American audiences will probably think this is the first and only film about the famous French chanteuse, but it's just the first and only one to be honored by the Academy Awards. Marion Cottilard famously popped up out of nowhere-to Americans-and won a gold statuette for her flawless portrayal of the French icon. Her performance is truly moving. I can't speak for French audiences, just as French audiences have a different view of how American icons are portrayed, but to American audiences, she embodies the role.Told in a non-linear structure, snippets of Edith Piaf's life are strung together, distinguishable only by the makeup on Marion's face. When she's younger, she has a fresh face. When she's becoming a star, she's wearing makeup and starting to paint in her eyebrows. When she's an icon, she has an enormous amount of makeup and a fragile posture. The scene order is a bit confusing, but if you watch it more than once, like I did, or really pay attention to the make-up, it's easier to understand.To my fellow Americans, if you don't immediately register the name of Edith Piaf, I guarantee you know who she is. She's that distinctly French singing voice you always hear when a restaurant or movie is trying to conjure the mood. And, of course, she sang the title song before Louis Armstrong did. There's an adorable bed and breakfast I like to go to on the coast that's all French-themed, and every time a guest checks into his room, a CD of Edith Piaf plays softly from the nightstand stereo.So, if you're at all a fan of French music, French movies, or biopics of 20th century singers, you've got to see this movie. It's as much a modern classic to France as Chicago is to America. And what's a classic French movie without Gérard Depardieu? He plays a nightclub owner who spots Edith Piaf's talent and gives her a break.DLM warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie might not be your friend. There are a few camera swirls throughout the movie that will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",9,0,0,2 August 2019

The Deer Hunter," A masterpiece of the era
","Most Vietnam War movies are extremely difficult to watch, and The Deer Hunter is no exception. Christopher Walken won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his unforgettable performance, and the horrors his character endures are enough to forever burn this movie in your brain. The Deer Hunter has been universally hailed as one of the greatest war movies, and the greatest Vietnam War movie ever made, so it's absolutely worth watching. Just make sure you're up for it, because it's very heavy.The film starts out showing you the personal lives of three soon-to-be soldiers as they enjoy their last days in America; before long, you're as invested in them as the filmmakers have banked on, setting the stage for an emotional, suspenseful drama. Robert De Niro and Christopher Walken leave the country both in love with the same girl, Meryl Streep, and John Savage has just married a woman carrying another man's child; their friendship comes first as they go off to war. When they come home, they're not the same men who left, and since the audience has seen what they've endured, we understand better than some of their friends.It's unfortunate that both Coming Home and The Deer Hunter were released in the same year, because both movies are excellent in their own right and don't deserve to be constantly compared with one another. Both movies show that men who are lucky enough to return are permanently changed, and both show physical as well as mental effects. Coming Home doesn't show any war violence, so if you're on the squeamish side, you'll probably like that one better. The main focuses, and certainly the most memorable parts, of The Deer Hunter are the war violence and the bond between the three friends who will never be the same.
More mature audiences will remember the extra sadness behind the filming of this movie, but younger folks probably don't know that the entire cast and crew had to put their emotions aside while the cameras were rolling. There's an added tenderness you can feel between the cast members, but it does make it even harder to watch.The Deer Hunter is a masterpiece; even people who don't like it admit that it's fantastically put together and wonderfully acted. You don't have to watch it, because it's very upsetting, but if you're the type of person who likes to make 'must-see' movie lists, add this to it. Also, if you've been unlucky enough to only watch lousy war movies-yes, I used to be one of those people-this movie will change your mind about the genre.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children.

The Sixth Sense," Iconic scary flick
","Is there anyone who hasn't seen M. Night Shyamalan's masterpiece The Sixth Sense by now? My parents were extremely smart, knowing what a scaredy-cat kid I was, and didn't let me watch it until I was sixteen. I still screamed at the top of my lungs and ran out of the room. It's not the most upsetting movie I've seen, but it was at that point in my life.Young Haley Joel Osment, endearing himself into the hearts of every audience member around the world, is having a problem. He's struggling against the normal childhood bullies and getting along with his single mom, Toni Collette, but he also sees dead people. Sometimes they just scare the pants off him with their wounds, and sometimes they talk to him. Child psychologist Bruce Willis tries to help Haley through this difficult time, and the two bond. Since this movie is obviously a vehicle for Haley's incredible acting chops-although, you have to wonder why his parents let him act in such emotionally damaging roles-it's quite a feat that Bruce is able to shine as well. In the immortal scene when Haley tells him, 'I see dead people,' both actors show off their chops. It's not just Haley's scene, because Bruce has to react to him with understanding, compassion, and trust.If you can handle it, this movie really is a classic that needs to be watched. I couldn't handle it, so I say to my fellow squeamish viewers, if you don't like the sight of blood, you're not going to like this movie. And whatever you do, if you've never seen it, don't talk about the movie with anyone or watch the movie 50 First Dates, as a critical plot point will get spoiled for you.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to scary scenes and upsetting scenes involving a child, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",6,1,1,2 July 2019
RED," Cute action comedy
","How much fun would it be to see Helen Mirren, Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, Richard Dreyfuss, and Ernest Borgnine all together in an action movie? If you think it would be fun, go out and rent the cute comedy RED. They're all retired CIA agents, and they know some very important state secrets, so before long, they find themselves fighting to keep their peaceful retirement, and indeed, fighting for their lives. Bruce Willis's love interest is Mary-Louise Parker, and while I found her annoying in her younger days, she's quite likable in her middle age. She and Bruce have an adorable rapport together, and it's a sweet and darling romance. She works at a government pension office, and Bruce continually pretends he's lost or has a problem with his check, just so he can call and talk to her on the phone. How cute!'Old timers still got it' movies are very good, when done well and given a respectful script, so if you like that genre as much as I do, check out this action comedy. You might not think of some of the cast members as old timers, but this movie definitely has more of a 'young-old timers' vibe to it than watching a bunch of octogenarians escape from a nursing home.",7,1,1,25 June 2019
Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2," You can't help but cry
","The final movie in the 8-part film franchise is the one everyone's waiting for, and not just because it's the last one. There are so many elements that make the audience feel invigorated and validated, and so much we've been waiting ten years to finally see. Have you been waiting for Maggie Smith to show she can play with the big boys? Have you been hoping Julie Walters would blow her top? Have you been waiting for Harry to choose between Hermione, Ginny, Cho Chang, and Luna? Did your heart go out to Professor Snape in the books, and you've been anxiously awaiting the film's reproduction of his backstory through flashbacks?Well, the great part about this movie is it has incredible special effects. As you've been expecting since the story took a darker turn, there's an epic build-up to a pretty intense battle. Ralph Fiennes is a very formidable bad guy, and as he and his cronies surround Hogwarts, Maggie Smith and the other good guys cast protection spells around the castle. It's a very ominous scene with quite an emotional feeling for the students and audience members, since we've all grown up watching the castle for the past ten years. The battle scenes themselves are quite upsetting, so be prepared if you've fallen in love with certain characters that not everyone gets a happy ending.Finally, the moment everyone's been waiting for: Alan Rickman gets his day in the sun. His character, Professor Snape, has become a universal cult favorite, even among those who haven't read the books. A warning to those who have read the books: the page-to-screen conversion got severely cut. The seventh novel was a very emotional read, and as you immersed yourself in the pages and pages and pages of Snape's childhood and teenage years, you were probably hoping he'd get an entire movie to himself. While he doesn't get the majority of the movie's screen time, you can still love those scenes.You can't please everyone, and J.K. Rowling received more than her fair share of criticism about the way her book series ended. If you don't end up liking the end of this movie, just remember that the books ended the same way, and Steve Kloves and the rest of Hollywood probably wanted to be faithful to the original story. There is one omission from the text that did bother me: Harry makes a speech in front of the entire school, and when he finds out he was wrong, he doesn't make another speech, as he does in the book. If you know what part I'm talking about and you loved that part of the book, it might be a good warning to know it's missing from the movie.All in all, it's a very good adaptation of the final book, including most of the text in the last two movies. You'll cry, both out of sadness and out of heartwarming nostalgia that these kids you've connected with since you and they were ten years old are now grown ups. It's a true experience watching these movies, let alone growing up alongside them and going to the theaters to see them, so with all the history between you, it's not really possible to hold lasting grudges or express more than a little disappointment in the way the story turned out. And, of course, the very end is priceless.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However this one's pretty violent and upsetting for kids, I'd wait until my kids were pre-teens or older before letting them watch it.",8,0,0,20 June 2019
Looper," Imaginative and thrilling
","If you liked the action thriller Minority Report, check out Looper, another imaginative action thriller that revolves around the premise of killing criminals-and something goes wrong. In the futuristic world, contract killers use time travel to get rid of the bad guys, and every person they kill has a bag over his face so the elimination can be done quickly and without guilt. As Joseph Gordon-Levitt goes about his work, one victim arrives at the elimination site without a bag on his face, and he looks extremely familiar. It turns out it's the older version of Joe, played by Bruce Willis!If that blows your mind, you'll love this movie. I saw it in the theaters and was extremely riveted. It's quick, smart, mysterious, and dramatic. With a bit of makeup and quite a bit of studying Bruce's mannerisms and facial expressions, Joe is a perfect replica. Their scenes together are very well-acted and tense. You'll also get to see Emily Blunt trying out a very different role in a Southern accent, and Paul Dano and Jeff Daniels in supporting roles. You might want to put the kids to bed on this one, but it's a very good movie and I recommend you give it a shot-no pun intended.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",8,2,8,27 June 2019
Footloose," The best remake I've ever seen
","Hands down, the 2011 Footloose is the best remake I've ever seen. In the traditional definition, a story is re-filmed and re-released. There's nothing in Webster's that necessitates a fresh take, although most remakes try to put their own spin on the story. How often have you gone to see a remake and been thoroughly disappointed that scene was cut, entire characters were written out, the modern time period makes the story inaccessible, or someone in the cast tries to say his or her lines the total opposite of how the original did? In Footloose, every single thing is exactly the same as it was in 1984. You can probably count on your right hand the differences, and they're all very minor. The 'chicken' game with the tractors is replaced by a figure-eight chase with school buses. See? Not that big a deal.The script is almost identical. 'Do you want to kiss me?' 'Someday.' 'What's all this someday s***?' Every song and sequence is included, and Lynne Taylor-Corbett's original choreography is faithfully stuck to. The costumes are same, too, with the white tank top, the tie on the first day of school, the burgundy tux jacket, the pink fluttery prom dress, and the 'Dance Your A** Off' t-shirt! This is truly a remake, redoing a film for modern audiences so they can watch stars they know in roles their parents remember from thirty years earlier. Your mom talks about Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer, but you'll tell your kids about Kenny Wormald and Julianne Hough. Your mom giggles incessantly and gets a lump in her throat when Chris Penn learns to dance, and you'll do the same with Miles Teller. John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest are replaced by Dennis Quaid and Andie MacDowell, whom kids today think of as 'parent-age' instead of young and beautiful '80s stars.There's only one person I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. If you're that person who thinks a remake is only good if it changes the original and adds its own spin on it, don't rent Footloose. Wait until West Side Story comes out and have your fill. As for me, I probably won't go to the theaters to see the remake of West Side Story. I'll be too busy watching the DVD I just bought of Footloose.",10,0,2,31 July 2019
Hart's War," A little uneven
","The beginning of the movie shows Colin Farrell leaving his army base with a fellow soldier, and on the way out, they're ambushed by undercover Nazis. His buddy dies, but Colin leads a desperate chase through the snowy forest, eventually getting caught after falling into a trench full of dead frozen bodies. It's a very violent and creepy scene, and since the entire rest of the movie never even references it, I have no idea why it was included. The rest of the movie takes place in a POW camp and has to do with a court martial hearing, and the upsetting first ten minutes could have easily been shaved off.At the POW camp, Colin meets fellow soldiers Cole Hauser, Linus Roache, Maury Sterling, Sam Jaeger, Sam Worthington, and Colonel Bruce Willis, the head honcho who decides everything and even has a working relationship with the prison commander, Marcel Iures. If you keep your eyes open, you'll see Adrian Grenier for a few minutes, but don't get too attached to him. When black prisoners enter the camp, tensions rise and some of the soldiers turn on one another. Eventually, there's a court martial, but I won't tell you the reason for it, since it's almost halfway through the film before it starts.For me, the most interesting part of the movie was the introduction to the POW camp. There's a very moving scene where the German train gets attacked by Allied planes, and the prisoners, freed from the compartment, fear they'll be mistaken for German troops. They scatter around in clumps, until finally the audience sees an aerial shot of their design: gigantic human-made letters of POW, and the planes leave them alone. The first impression of everyone's characters is also interesting, but once the court martial starts, the story turns pretty predictable and I found it hard to remain invested. The upside is you'll get to see some good performances, notably from Terrence Howard.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. The first ten minutes are filmed with a handheld camera, and some angles swirl, swoop, or zoom quickly without warning, and it will make you sick. In other words, 'Don't Look, Mom!'",4,0,0,10 July 2019
Sin City," Stylish, a comic book brought to life
","In this stylized adaptation of the comic book, Sin City features an all-star cast in over-the-top roles glorifying sex and violence. It's all supposed to be tongue-in-cheek, so be prepared for that type of acting and filmmaking style when you rent it. It's a black and white film with filters and saturations designed to make it look like the drawn pages of a glossy comic book. Occasionally, there are bursts of color, like red blood, that once again bring up the comic book feeling. Visually, if you're a comic book aficionado, you'll probably be in love with this movie.I'm not, so with the excessive violence and gratuitous sexual themes, I didn't fall in love with this movie. Obviously, in a comic book, it's a necessity for one of the female characters to be a stripper, but to me, most movies that feature strippers film the scenes in an exploitive manner. The movie is segmented into vignettes, and each vignette has an extraordinary amount of violence so that at the end of the movie, you're surprised anyone's left alive to inhabit the city. But if you want to see Bruce Willis, Jessica Alba, Rosario Dawson, Mickey Rourke, Elijah Wood, Benicio del Toro, Michael Clarke Duncan, Clive Owen, Brittany Murphy, Michael Madsen, Josh Hartnett, Marley Shelton, and Alexis Bledel all together in a very stylized movie, you might like it. Watch the preview first, though, so you know what you're getting into.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. This is a stylized movie, and there are swirling camera movements and canted angles that it will make you sick.

However, due to adult violence and sexual content, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",3,0,2,2 July 2019
All the President's Men," Accurate portrayal of Watergate reporting
","All the President's Men is a recounting of Bob Woodward's and Carl Bernstein's reporting during President Nixon's Watergate scandal. Robert Redford, a real-life political activist, and Dustin Hoffman star as the reporters, and they're joined by Jason Robards, Jane Alexander, Hal Holbrook, Jack Warden, Meredith Baxter, Ned Beatty, Stephen Collins, and Martin Balsam. Unless you really hate political films, there's no reason to avoid this all-star political thriller.While there have been many Watergate movies made through the decades, this one was released in 1976 while the scandal was fresh in everyone's minds. William Goldman, the screenwriter, did an enormous amount of research and consulting with the real Woodward and Bernstein to make his script as accurate as possible. All the details that are now taught in history classes are present in this movie; if you watch this one during your Nixon module instead of reading that chapter in your textbook, I guarantee you'll ace your test.As a side note, I didn't watch this movie during history class. My teacher showed us the 1999 comedy Dick, which is a hilarious spoof of All the President's Men. Everything I learned about Watergate I learned from that film, so by the time I watched All the President's Men, I couldn't stop cracking up! Depending on whether you'd rather laugh or feel tense and dramatic when you watch it, you can decide which accounting of Watergate to watch first.",7,0,0,25 September 2017
The Wizard of Oz," Judy Garland embodies the American Dream
","I don't think there's any kid who lives their entire childhood without watching The Wizard of Oz and creating a soft, cozy spot in their heart for the film to stay the rest of their life. As a kid, it's pretty much impossible to dislike. Sure, there are a few kids out there who get scared by the Margaret Hamilton, but it's still a wonderful, magical, safe place to spend ninety minutes.So, since everyone in the world has seen this movie, there's no point in my describing the plot and giving reasons why you should rent it. Most of you probably own a copy; we recently exchanged our very used VHS copy for an anniversary DVD. We also have a behind-the-scenes book about the making of the movie!When my brother and I grew up watching it, we believed when the film transitioned from black-and-white to color, that was the first time Hollywood discovered Technicolor. It was such incredible technology, we assumed Hollywood wanted to ease audiences into their new world by showing them colored film only when Judy Garland awakened in a fantasy world. To this day, no matter what anyone tells us-and despite the fact that I was instructed differently during my years at film school-we still credit The Wizard of Oz as the first movie made in color.To me, what makes a movie a classic is the ability to get more out of it each time you watch it. Every time I watch The Wizard of Oz, I see it from a slightly different perspective. Maybe I'll be able to fully appreciate Frank Morgan's layered performance, or maybe I'll see the story as symbolic instead of literal. Gone with the Wind won the Academy Award for 1939's Best Picture, but although it was a grand epic and an enormous amount of work went into it, we've given the Best Picture Rag to The Wizard of Oz. It stands the test of time better. It's much more of a classic, in how I define the word.The Wizard of Oz is a true staple of Americana, a film that reaches the hearts of all Americans in a way it culturally might not be able to reach others. Americans have it in their blood to be pioneers, explorers, conquerors, and to seek outside themselves in order to feel 'whole'. If you don't understand this, you're probably not American or need to brush up on your history lessons. In this 1939 classic, Judy Garland lives the American Dream. She's misunderstood at home and feels unsafe, so when she sings the iconic 'Somewhere Over the Rainbow' in her famously warbly voice, it signals to the audience that she's going to try to find an outside source to make her happy. It's the timeless theme of wanting to grow up quickly and then wishing to relive your childhood, all told in the magical Technicolor fantasy. Any adult who's ever tried to survive on their own, forge a new path different than their family, and prove that this time, when they go out into the world, things will be different, probably cries at the end of the movie. The lesson that no one seems to learn is taught in a very lovely, heartwarming way in The Wizard of Oz: it's impossible to find happiness by going outside yourself. You have to find happiness in your own heart, at home, first.",10,2,2,27 June 2018
Rock Star," Pretty bad, only for Marky Mark fans
","Okay, let's be honest: The only reason anyone would sit through this movie is because she has a huge crush on Mark Wahlberg. That being said, I've sat through it.Rock Star is everything you'd expect in a movie about a, well, rock star. Wild performances, drugs, booze, blackout parties, sex, more sex, and Mark Wahlberg. I'm sure there are people who actively seek out those types of movies, but I just haven't met any. Unless you really, really adore him, you'd be better off skipping this one. Jennifer Aniston even regretted making it, and when a star badmouths her own movie, you know it's a bad sign.If you're like me, there's no use trying to talk sense into you. I've sat through so many terrible movies, all for love of eye candy. I understand your plight. But I've given you fair warning that this one's pretty bad.Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to graphic sex scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",1,2,4,12 June 2017
High Fidelity," Quirky dark romance
","In one of the last classicly '90s films, High Fidelity, John Cusack stars as a classicly '90s hero: he's single in his thirties, doesn't know why, and wants more than anything to be in a relationship. Nowadays, that type of man doesn't really exist anymore; he got married in 2000.As John reflects on his past relationships, he talks to the audience and exposes them to his work and friends. He works at a record shop, and music is a huge part of his life, so if you can't really identify with him in his romantic troubles or his love of music, you will probably find the movie irritating and boring. As it is, I'm a '90s kid, but a little on the younger side, and I think I might have missed the core demographic of this movie by a few years. I'm not entranced by vinyl, and I tended to see the main character's shortcomings rather than his qualities.While nostalgia is a good reason to pick up this movie, you might also want to watch it for the supporting cast. Jack Black, Catherin Zeta-Jones, Joan Cusack, Tim Robbins, Lisa Bonet, Lili Taylor, Natasha Wagner, and Iben Hjejle all contribute to this colorful film in their own way. I didn't end up liking High Fidelity, but I don't usually like dark comedies or quirky romances.",4,0,3,16 December 2017
From Here to Eternity," Fantastic wartime classic
","Even if you've never seen From Here to Eternity, I can guarantee you've seen one very famous scene. You know the black-and-white makeout scene on the beach that's been spoofed and referenced hundreds of times since? The two actors kissing are Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in From Here to Eternity.This is a WW2 movie, and one of the best classic war films, even though there are no scenes on the battlefield. Montgomery Clift, a recent transfer to the Hawaiian army base, has a reputation for being a good boxer, but he refuses to continue fighting at his new base. To punish him for his refusal, the captain makes his life miserable to hopefully wear him down. If you want the captain to 'get his', read on. The captain's wife, Deborah Kerr, has an affair with a sergeant, Burt Lancaster. In the meantime, Monty and his army pal Frank Sinatra frequent a nightclub on their nights off. While Monty finds love with a prostitute, Frankie manages to anger the very mean and violent Ernest Borgnine.See, there's plenty of drama without stepping foot on the battlefield! From Here to Eternity is a very famous movie, but it's also a fantastic one. Deborah Kerr bleached her famously red locks and tried on an American accent for the role, a seductive type she wasn't used to playing. Donna Reed, as goody-two-shoes as it gets, plays the hardened hooker Monty falls for. She won an Oscar for her against-type performance, paving the way for other good girls like Shirley Jones, who also won an Oscar when she went against type and played a prostitute in Elmer Gantry. Frank Sinatra also won an Oscar for this movie, but it's far from his best performance. He himself always said he should have won his Oscar for The Man with the Golden Arm. Montgomery Clift and Burt Lancaster, while in very different situations in the film, both fall in love with women they shouldn't, and try to stand up for their convictions even when it's difficult. It's great to see the different acting styles: Monty with the word 'conflicted' tattooed on his forehead, and water boiling beneath his sensitive reserve, and Burt with gritted teeth and lava simmering beneath his strength.At the 1954 Oscars, the film swept Best Picture, Director, Screenplay, Sound, Editing, Cinematography, and Supporting Actor and Actress awards. While Burt and Monty were pitted against each other for Best Actor, William Holden beat them out in the overrated Stalag 17. Deborah Kerr, who never won a competitive Oscar, lost to the ridiculous performance of Audrey Hepburn in Roman Holiday.",8,6,7,13 September 2017
The Godfather," Why wasn't it Anthony Quinn?
","I'm not really the target audience for The Godfather franchise, but I did go into the movies with an open mind. After all, I love heavily dramatic, soapy stories, I recognize the quality of the cast, and my mother's side of the family comes from Sicily. With all those elements in place, why wouldn't I like a movie about the importance of family, Italian heritage, and loyalty?I'm not a fan of violence, but ironically, the version of The Godfather that I saw had been edited for appropriate television audiences. Much of the blood and violence was cut out, the swear words were muffled, and the sex scenes were deleted. The movie was only an hour long-just kidding! I don't know how or why this movie became so legendary, since to me, it felt like a B-picture starring a bloated, tired, low-energy Marlon Brando. This felt like a typical '70s movie, or an '80s television movie, with cheap production values and a has-been lead. I'll never, never understand why Marlon Brando was cast as the title role, and why, after his performance was seen during rehearsals, he wasn't replaced by someone else. Why wasn't Anthony Quinn cast? Marlon Brando must have patterned his famous, never-endingly mimicked accent after a relative or family friend, but among my Sicilian family line, and meeting people during my trips to Italy, no one has sounded even remotely like the cotton-mouthed, whispering, jaw-jutting 'Italian' accent.I doubt I'm the only person in the world who doesn't like The Godfather or its sequels, but those of us who aren't fans are certainly quiet. If you haven't seen it yet, I'm sure you'll want to at least try it out, since there are so many famous moments to the first movie. There's the offer, the cannoli, the bag of fruit, the car bomb, the fishing trip, and of course, the horse's head. Marlon Brando scratches his jowls, James Caan is a royal jerk, and Al Pacino explains the difference between personal and business. But most importantly, there's tons of self-importance and an almost tongue-in-cheek seriousness that begs the question, why were there two sequels?Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to violence, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",3,3,8,31 January 2019
