Mission: Impossible III," Watch out, James Bond, Ethan Hunts here!
","First things first: the mission impossible series couldn't gotten any worse. The first two sucked harder than Jenna Jameson on a busy day. So I took my seat in the theater and prayed to the gods above: please, let the third one be the proverbial charm. And what do you know? The gods listened. The prologue kicks frickin'ass and has the perfect set up to the rest of the movie.(Spoiler: this scene is a preview of a terrifying torture-scene where Hoffman's character really hurts Hunt in ways you can't imagine).The film was of to a good start, but could it sustain this level of nail-biting tension? Hell, yeah! This movie has more mind-blowing action pieces than the other two combined (a helicopterchase through a windmillpark for example). Plus it has some real emotion. Hunt is married this time around and Hoffman's bad guy takes full advantage of Hunt's only weakness, his wife.Furthermore the direction J.J. Abrams took the story is as close as you can get to a real homage to the original series. There's is a real life team of IMF agents kicking ass and taking names. Ving Rhames is just too cool for school, but also the minor parts really deliver in this high octane action-thriller.Stand out is Simon Pegg, the genius behind Shaun of the Dead, he is just hilariously clueless as a computer-nerd helping Hunt on his many missions.I know when the filmmakers of the new James Bond-series see this movie, they leave with cold sweat dripping down their backs. They know they better deliver a brilliant Bond come end of the year, because for now MI 3 can call itself the king of the spy-world.",9,10,21,2 May 2006
Captain Marvel," It's a solid entry in the MCU
","Is it great? No. But is it a 5,5 (current rating)? Hell, no! It starts a bit slow, but in the second act it really picks up speed. For an Marvel origin movie it's a solid entry. Better than Captain America, Thor, Doctor Strange, Ant-Man and Black Panther. Only Iron Man Spider-Man: Homecoming and Guardians of the Galaxy have better first entries.",8,51,178,6 March 2019
War of the Worlds," The Anti-ID4
","My oh my, I've seen the biggest blockbusters this year and frankly I'm dog tired. So when I sat down for another popcorn flick, it got me worried a bit: 'Do I still love films, or should I just throw in the towel and call it a day?' Right of the bat, I felt relieved. There's still hope and his name is: Spielberg. So what else is new, you might ask. Nothing, would be my answer. Because in the last twelve years (from Jurassic Park and Schindlers List in 1993, threw Saving Private Ryan and A.I.) there's only one big name director who really got better with age. Scorcese and Lynch and all the other 50 plus directors never adapted to the modern times. Spielberg does that and remains classic at the same time.What about this new film of his? It's just unbelievable that such a big movie got such a big heart at the center of it all. War of the Worlds story centers around a struggling man and his two estranged kids. Ray (Cruise in top form) has never really committed himself to be a good father and role-model and his kids dread to visit him on the weekends, which they rarely do. So far WotW is a great drama and I could've watched it for another hour and a half, but the invaders from outer space have different plans. And faster than you can say 'holy crap, there goes my house' the family drives away from there home, fleeing from the nasty aliens.On their drive to Boston a lot of stuff happens to the family that really scared the living daylights out of me. Not because of what you see, but (here it comes Michael Bay and Roland Emmerich) because of what you NOT see. You don't see an alien-vessel every ten seconds or ten minutes for that matter. The whole movie you don't see anything the family doesn't see. That's why you give a rat's ass if something would've happen to them, and that's what makes a great movie. YOU CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS!",9,29,64,27 June 2005
