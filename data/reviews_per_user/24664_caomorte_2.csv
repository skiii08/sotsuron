Hereditary," Why the bad criticism?Most of you didn't even pay to see it
","Imdb is a very democratic 'place' and has this wide spectrum of people reviewing and it shouldn't be has considered has it is. I obviously look for the score a movie has in here but that doesn't put me down if I sense I should see this or that flick. 
I love horror since ever and I've seen the genre go through so many colors.One thing I am sure is there are movies for each one of you but this movie ain't for everyone and I'm sorry but not everyone gets what real cinema is about. I am being cruel, unpolite and showing political incorrectness but some of you here are just plain dumb or live in a planet of their own. 
Movies aren't supposed to be all the same and there are many ways to tell a story.
Hereditary is brilliant has it is.The cinematography,writing,directing,music,editing and actors performances are top-notch!
Toni Collette has an unbelieveble acting in this movie. This could be a drama!The fact that Gabriel Byrne's character is so small is incredible because that character has to be like that (a dimmed personality because there are people like that in real life ).Any actor with his status would want to shine a little bit more here but he does what he is suppose to do and 
give life to a character that is just half-visible. 
This movie mixes some old ideas together and doesn't bring many new ones to the table but who's being doing something new in the genre for the past decade?Few!
 Hereditary is slow paced but unfortunately this doesn't mean slow-minded people will get it.Slow pace isn't a bad thing for itself, man!Just stop whining about it. 
People who make bad reviews just for fun or based in their narrow minded entertainment experiences as viewers should first make a review of their lives and their tastes and their capacity to reach certain levels of cultural artistry.What I mean by this is you just waste time of your precious existence trolling and writting bad reviews about pieces of art that aren't bad or as bad as you state and the problem isn't the art but the subject viewer (YOU) that just can't get it thus gets annoyed and goes on a spiral of bullying against people who actually made an excellent job. 
Go and review bad movies (yes,there are a lot of them to be reviewed by you) if you wanna go that way .The ones you don't get,leave them alone or try to acquire some taste ,evolve,open your minds,I don't know...get a life and learn to be impartial on your reviews ! It's about time someone would offend you has you offend people who work hard to give you entertainment most of you take for granted and watch for free.",10,1,2,25 August 2018
Megamind," Heavy Metal!!!
","As a metalhead and comic book fan I love this movie,its cast,its soundtrack and it's simple but effective supermanish story.
Megamind is great as a comedy and even if it's full of references an adult may be drawn into easier than a child what I can say is this movie is my 4 year old girl favorite. The only song that isn't hard rock is her favorite song right now.
Great entertainment,folks!",10,0,0,28 February 2019
