The New World," Terrence Malik the magic man.
","Terrence Malik can pull so much from every frame, nuance after nuance. So much can be told in an instant. I think that is a beautiful thing. Most raw in it's portrayal of the fight for survival of the first Jamestown settlers against themselves, disease and indigenous people, but able to find it's simple truth, with the use of a simple, but stunningly beautiful Indian girl and the two men she loved. If you can get past the American idea that cinema should be about wall to wall talk about some over drenched plot, this film may teach you something. It was very visually poetic and left you with a feeling to play with long, long after it was over.",Null,1,4,17 June 2006
