The Blair Witch Project," impressed
","This film has the potential to be pyschologically damaging. The way that the whole film is based around your imagination works wonders, the way it works on what u think could be there is far worse, if you had seen anything it would ruin the film.    Think this is a very clever and well done film, from the 'myth' to the actually disapearence...i still have not seen one interview from the actors, the whole thing is so well done.  The end still haunts me.",10,1,2,2 December 1999
