National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Another ripping yarn
","If you liked the first one then heres more of the same. A fast moving, simple adventure story with plenty of action, twists and turns. It manages to out-do the first movie with the major 'kidnapping'. Nicholas cage isn't my favorite actor as I believe he is often miscast as a serious hero. This is more his style as a tongue in cheek hero. good support from Angelina Jolie's dad and Helen Mirren. I enjoyed the purported links to factual evidence as in the links to civil war heroes and villains, the twin desks, one at buck house and the other in the oval office. I never knew there were in fact three Eiffel towers(if it is indeed the case). A sit back and enjoy the ride movie.",7,1,1,11 June 2009
