National Treasure: Book of Secrets," Indiana Jones - lite, but fun nonetheless!
","This would normally be a popcorn-summer-type movie and it would make good money in normal summers... remember that the fourth installment of Indiana Jones will be out next summer and it would bury this cotton candy movie making if it went head to head. I don't blame the producers releasing it now at all! This is a very decent part two in the series where Nick Cage so desperately needs another movie hit. You can tell that every actor in the movie was having a blast on their new 'treasure' hunt. I'll not spoil any part of the movie for those who are considering going (I'm sure other's have in their critiques), but I will say they did have a huge hint that there will be third National Treasure that will need to be found! You'll enjoy this movie and it's over the top plot line and cardboard bad guy (played by the awesome Ed Harris), but don't expect Shakespeare... just buy the popcorn on the way in and don't be late because you'll not want to miss a new Disney cartoon at the beginning to warm you up!",7,0,2,30 December 2007
Walk the Line," A Legend shows all of his warts!
","Beautifully acted and filmed!! Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon embody Johnny Cash and June Carter Cash!! This movie doesn't pull any punches and it tells the tale of Johnny Cash's meteoric rise and the demons he carries along the way. I got the distinct impression that if he hadn't met and married June Carter, he may have left us several years before he did!! Phoenix and Witherspoon must be commended because they did all of their own singing and even though neither quite sounded like their perspective alter egos, it worked in the performance and I felt both actors had stopped acting and started reacting very early on in the picture! The movie was a bit too long and it had a brief time when the story slowed down, but overall a must see and an obvious Oscar contender come February!",9,0,1,27 November 2005
Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Taboos broken all through this movie!!!
","I didn't want to see this movie when I was seeing the trailer, but after seeing Sacha Baron Cohen play a gay French NASCAR driver in 'Talledega Nights; The Legend of Ricky Bobby', my curiosity in his talents were piqued! The movie is shot in a documentary style and 'Borat' goes about offending every major religion, heritage, lifestyle and color of skin throughout America! Absolutely hilarious with guilty laughing throughout the movie! Beware of some explicit and shocking nudity in this movie that is also a disturbing scene! Watching a fat, hairy man wrestle with 'Borat' is something I may need therapy for in the near future! Have an open mind while seeing this movie and know that good satire takes no prisoners and makes no exceptions!",8,3,10,11 November 2006
Mission: Impossible III," The best one of the three made!!
","After watching, and somewhat rolling my eyes, at Tom Cruise's various versions of '... how can I make a bigger fool of myself this week' over the past couple of years, I was not wanting to go and see this movie. But, I had a rare day off and the only movie in the stables that remotely interested me was MI 3. So, my wife and I went.Even though some of the stunts were the 'over the top' variety that we've come to expect from these movies, it was scaled back a bit and actually contributed to the story! And yes, there is a story here!Ethan Hunt has been teaching vs. being a field agent since we've last visited him and he's thrown back in the mix because his favorite student has been captured and she possesses valuable information. So, Ethan's back and his team is doing more impossible things yet again!Philip Seymour Thomas plays a perfect bad guy that has absolutely NO conscience about him and cares not one bit for those near him. He's ruthless and calculating and smart. He could have played his character with reckless abandon, but he played him more sinister and dark. This made him all the more scary! Just like the other two films, expect a twist! I'll not say what, but given the past history of the other two, I saw it coming almost from the start! I'll leave it at that! Bottom line, leave any Cruise eye rolling experiences at the door and hang on to your seats! It's a great start to the summer season and I highly recommend this third installment of the franchise! I look forward to the fourth because the semi-truck obvious ending lead to that conclusion! Hope you have as much fun as I did while watching this movie!!!",9,0,2,6 May 2006
3:10 to Yuma," Oscar Race Starts Early This Year!
","Well, growing up enjoying every type of movie that involved guns, horses and guns, I was really looking forward to this remake of a Glenn Ford 1957 classic... I was not let down one bit! I was invited to see a sneak preview with a group of print writers from several papers. I could see them scribbling away while I was soaking in the post Civil War look that was being shown up on the big screen... I was 6 years old again and seeing a true American Western... yippee!!! This movie was extremely well written and equally well acted. Russell Crowe and Christian Bale give Oscar worthy performances and Ben Forster, as Crowe's number one henchmen Charlie Prince, gives the finest supporting acting performance I've seen in years! He'll probably be overlooked at Oscar time, but he commanded the screen when his character in a maniacal greatness, shot man after man in a cold blooded ease.This has a Clint Eastwood revisionist feel to it with the good guys and bad guys living in a gray line blur. Peter Fonda plays a mercenary Pinkerton man that admits that he's only read the Bible and no other books, but kills Apache with disregard. Ben Wade (Crowe) calls him on the apparent hypocrisy of his actions.I'll not spoil the ending here, but I'll tell you that for all of Ben Wade's rotten nature, he proves that 'even bad guys love their mothers!' You'll enjoy this movie if you like guns, horses and guns... like me!!!",10,4,10,6 September 2007
Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest," A true popcorn summer movie!
","Alright, I have to admit I was really looking forward to this movie and so was my wife. We missed out on the first day and part of the second because there was others who felt the exact same way! Even though the movie did run a bit long, the action never stopped and by the end, I was ready for a break to catch my breath! The movie is what I was expecting with more CGI characters and over the top swashbuckling sword fights! I wasn't disappointed! The whole movie is set up to lead to the third installment and I can only imagine what craziness has been thought up for that! You will need to see the first film to follow the characters and their motivation and get the ending of this one!!! Oh yeah, a surprise ending made me, and every one else in the theater, have an aha moment! I won't spoil anything about the movie if you are planning on seeing it. Just know that the action is quite over the top and the story is pure fantasy as are the characters, but we aren't going to see this movie for true to life historical fact now are we? It's like a ride at DisneyWorld on the big screen! Grab your popcorn and make sure your arms and legs are in your seat before the ride begins!!! ENJOY!",9,2,3,8 July 2006
Public Enemies," Public Enemies... eh
","Simply put, well acted, but poor editing. Fight scenes were WAY too long and they seemed to just go on and on and on and on... you get it now.The film editor could have cut out most of the abusive scene with Dillinger's girlfriend getting slapped around by the fat Fed. Also, they could have completely left out the sequence where she lies to the fat Fed to make him chase his tail... completely unnecessary for the story.The whole character of Giovanni Ribisi was unneeded and having them there took away from the movie and made it about 30 mins too long.They set up the final killing scene in what seemed to be actual time... come on guys, you had superb talent and a decent script. This could have been an Oscar contender if edited correctly. As it is, it was the most boring shoot 'em up I've seen in many, many years! Wait for the DVD!",3,2,5,5 July 2009
Ice Age: The Meltdown," Parts are cute... not bad altogether!
","I watched the original after it came out on DVD and I partially snoozed through it even then. I wasn't expecting to completely 'love' this movie, or, totally hate it either... I was right on my assumption! Some lines were really funny and the premise was pretty good too, but it dragged a bit and with the silly squirrel bouncing through giving everyone a slapstick laugh every now and then, it helped the movie move on down the road. I remember thinking at one time of what the squirrel character was doing in the movie... you find out at the end, but it had no purpose other than a brief interlude of silliness whilst the producers were trying to tell a potential love story forming between the two mammoths.Don't spend full price on the movie, go to the matin√©e, or, better yet, just wait for the DVD.Overall, cute but now great!",7,0,2,3 April 2006
Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End," Wild and Dark ending to this trilogy!!!
","After the first movie, I was completely charmed and had a great time watching the movie. I couldn't wait to see the second installment and I enjoyed the over the top cartoon like plot line and action. I was expecting more of the same in the third... I was wrong! The third movie spends the first hour with his crew 'rescuing' Cap'n Jack Sparrow from the other world and he has further lost what's left of his mind. Johnny Depp is, as always, entertaining in this character, but playing off himself, literally, is something to watch! The movie had great fight scenes and a strange wandering plot line that ends with the open ended possibility that there will be a fourth installment!! Too many loose ends left dangling to just let this movie franchise keep us wondering!!! I suppose that if the movie makes a billion dollars, then they could possibly finish it up and really give us a closure movie that will tie it all together! Mostly enjoyable, but more dark and mean! Not as cartoonish and fun this go around!",7,0,2,28 May 2007
Spider-Man 3," Why all of the hate? This movie was good!
","OK, so, I've gotten in the habit of reading people's opinions of movies on IMDb. For the most part, I'll agree with what is written. So, after I read most of the reviews here, I was expecting a 'cheesy' movie without much plot... Nothing further from the truth in actuality!Spidey fights 4 bad guys (if you include his own inner demons) and everything ties up at the end in good comic book fashion. The sub-plots help the movie along and I didn't see any extra characters that had no point in the movie. The Sandman was the most underutilized of characters, but with a movie 140 minutes long, someone has to be cut, or we'd have a 180 minute movie!!! All in all, I enjoyed it very much and I always use my wife as the movie barometer... if she snoozes then the movie is at best so-so; if she stays awake, then you have an exciting and entertaining flick. She slept through the first two Spiderman movies and was wide awake through number 3! That says it all from my point of view!",9,5,10,5 May 2007
The Prestige," Too dark and mean to be 'magical' to me!
","I must admit that this movie was shot beautifully and acted extremely well! I cannot fault the director with the way the story unfolded... my problem was with the story itself! WAY TOO MEAN AND DARK! This wasn't a movie about magic at all; it was a revenge movie plain and simple! I don't need to see happy go lucky endings every time I sit in a theater, but to have two characters that have such self loathing and mutual hatred that only intensifies, is disturbing! At the end of the movie, I watched all characters slip into such a dark and mean place, I wanted every one of them to die! I left the movie wanting the 135 minutes I wasted sitting there returned to me! I think that actors with the talent of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, not to mention the incredible Micheal Cain can choose much better vehicles to showcase their abilities!",5,3,7,15 January 2007
The Hateful Eight," A Hollywood revision of a western... just awful!
","I'm late to this because I didn't go to the theater to see it and I'm glad I didn't! Others have given the premise to the story so I'll just dive in... even if we buy into the belief that a murderous band of cutthroats, killing everyone in the haberdashery but leaving Bruce Dern alone is beyond far fetched; he'd be dead too if were in real life... but he needed to live so fluke of all flukes, the man who killed his son (Samuel L Jackson) happens to arrive so he could goad Dern into a fight and killing him giving one of the gang time to poison the coffee... contrived much? Then, Oswaldo (Tim Roth) , out of the blue, asks 'which one has a letter from Lincoln?'... how would he know that? That little tidbit was shared while on the stage and Jackson's character was a rider they just happened to pick up on the way. When John Ruth (Russell) realized he was poisoned, instead of pulling his pistol and killing Daisy (Leigh), he starts beating her up... that makes zero sense. Tarantino makes an over the top violent piece of crap that takes three hours to watch... only reason I gave it the time to watch was I was home sick and it filled in the time... I wish I had sat on my back porch and watch the birds instead... this movie is just plain awful!",1,1,3,15 July 2017
Nacho Libre," Typical silliness from one of our silly actors!
","My wife and I saw this movie because another movie that we wanted to see was sold out. So, I went in and expected to really hate this movie... I ended up giggling throughout the movie! No belly laughs, but lotsa snickering and giggles throughout! Not bad, but it could have been much better! I must hand it to Jack Black in the fact that he never played the character as anything but silly and not taking himself seriously throughout the film. If he would have played him sincere, then it would have been a total disaster! Not taking himself seriously was the only thing that remotely saved this movie! Don't go see this unless its a matin√©e, or just wait for it to come out on DVD! Silly fun, but not worth more than matin√©e price!",5,1,7,8 July 2006
The Bourne Ultimatum," Good film but lousy camera work!
","OK, so I've enjoyed the Bourne books and now all three of the movies. Matt Damon is Bourne and he makes James Bond look like a sissy! Good story and action. All things that should make a great movie, but the lousy camera shaking is for the frigging birds! I'm not sure why Greengrass thinks this is a good effect because it makes this movie so very hard to follow! I mean, he even has the camera moving when the actors are sitting at a table talking! The fight sequences are so hard to follow because he zooms in on the actors so tight you cannot follow who is who and you only know that Jason Bourne will win because he's the hero and he has to win! You cannot follow because the close proximity of the camera work doubled with the shaking and frenetic style! The director took a great story that I would seriously award a 10 and and made me knock 3 points off because of his first year film school style of cinematography!",7,9,17,12 August 2007
Ratatouille," Ratatatatat... this movie hits it's mark!
","Pixar, which burst on the scene about a dozen years back, has done it yet again!!! They have long turned animation on it's ear and made story telling a true art form with big time entertainment to boot! I was looking forward to seeing this movie mainly because I've yet to see a bad story from Pixar Studios and I know I'll be getting my money's worth... this was even better than what I was expecting! The animation is so real, I had to make sure that some of the background scenes were indeed animation and not a movie trick where they put their characters in an actual setting! Story very cute and fast paced! The kids will enjoy the animation and the adults will enjoy the humor! Great family movie... you will NOT be disappointed!!! Go and have fun!!",10,4,7,1 July 2007
Tropic Thunder," What movie was all of the people giving 10's watching?
","I read and waited and listened to friends I trusted to see this movie. I read just about every 'good' comment on the IMDb thread and I've always enjoyed Ben Stiller movies. So, when I finally was able to get the time to see the movie, it had made it to the $1.50 theater.I'm glad I couldn't find the time until then because this was the worst piece of junk I've seen in years! Holy moly... what movie was everyone else seeing? Tom Cruise, who was unrecognizable, only cursed and generally made an ass out of himself. Matthew, I'm the most annoying movie start ever, McConnehay just was himself... annoying! Robert Downer Jr was the only remotely entertaining part in the movie. Ben Stiller really let me down with the first 'real' scene when the director gets blown up and Stiller puts his head on the end of his rifle barrel.I never laughed, only an occasional chuckle, and it'll be a long time before I trust this board or any of my friend's recommendations for movies again!",1,20,40,2 November 2008
No Country for Old Men," Not sure what movie everyone else was seeing here!
","Alright, so, I waited until AFTER the Oscars to see this movie. I am a fan of every actor in this movie from previous work excluding the psycho killer played by Javier Bardem. I've just never heard of him before this. I'll never forget him now! The actors deliver in spades and the creepiness of Bardem's maniacal killer is impressive. We rented this movie out for a dollar and I was pleased it was available. Especially since I only wasted a buck! The killer gets started early with the strangling of a deputy sheriff which is a scene we've all seen on the previews. At this moment, I lost my wife, she got up and left to play on the computer! The movie was strange and scary throughout the first half. Josh Brolin is smart and wily as the poor man that happened on a scene where he found 2 million dollars. His character knew he was in trouble from the start he proved his smarts by out thinking everyone following him. That's what made his demise so strange... his character seemed to have known what was going to happen next until that moment. Not consistent at all.Anyhow, Tommy Lee Jones, Barry Corbin, Josh Brolin, Woody Harrelson and Javier Bardem put in good minimalist performances but the ending of the movie is weak. I needed to watch the bonus sections of the DVD to somewhat understand the sheriff and his motivation.I'm losing faith in Hollywood's ability to really make a good movie... the writers seem to have decided that they want endings where the movie goer can infer his own... that is not why I spend my money, I'm looking for escapism and some fulfillment. Don't expect that with this movie!So, maybe I'm too obtuse to fully grasp what in the heck the Coen brothers were trying to say here... with Hollywood's propensity to copy what works (again, in their eyes), then expect more unfilled endings to movies in the immediate future! With ticket prices down, you'd think Hollywood would get the message and start catering to the masses and not their pretentious and narcissistic ways! Completely disappointed here... the cinematography and acting highs was overshadowed by such a weak ending... I wish I could give this movie a '0'!",1,4,8,13 March 2008
The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford," Omigawd... I was ready to kill him myself by the time I left!
","OK, I'm a huge, extremely huge western movie fan. I try and see every western to give my support to the genre which is the only way to tell Hollywood to make more, but for friggin' sake, if you guys make one, at least make it interesting! This movie took forever to make a simple statement in the beginning that Robert Ford is creepy and Jesse is dangerous. The opening train robbery introducing the characters should have taken 5 minutes and it took 20! The acting is wooden with Casey Affleck just saying his lines while looking like a lost puppy walking around pit bulls. Pitt did a fair job, but he seemed to take himself too seriously in the role. Sam Shepard looked old enough to be Pitt's father and not his older brother Frank. He also had no rhythm with his character and just said his lines without much feeling. He and Pitt were not believable in the least as brothers. I didn't buy it for one minute.Too many characters that were there for absolutely no reason and weird long setups trying to tell a story that should have been much more simply told! Strange forshadowing mixed with telling the story from a backstory way... really slow and boring.If you want to see a really good psychological movie in the western genre, go and see 3:10 to Yuma, you'll enjoy it much more! Wait and rent this one... it's not worth the time spent sitting in the theater!",1,28,70,22 September 2007
X-Men: The Last Stand," Pulls no punches!!!
","The third installment in the X-Men series, and possibly the last, is a fitting end to the trilogy!! Rough, violent and with a message of tolerance!!! I enjoyed it, but I'm a big kid and enjoyed the Marvel cartoons as a kid... my wife thought it was stupid!!! What would she know? She had never even HEARD of Charles Xavier before I dragged her to the first one X Men! The Last Stand brings back Jean Grey as the Phoenix and the duel personalities are struggling from the start! She is dangerous and now the most powerful mutant ever!!! Which side will this conflicted character land? Wolverine is sure he can save her and so does Charles Xavier... one pays the ultimate price for trying to reach her inner goodness that is Jean Grey! The fight sequences are very violent and many characters simply disintegrate right before your eyes. At times the action and story was a bit over the top, but for the X-Men fans, this will seem very appropriate.It's worth seeing this movie in the theater; go and enjoy!",8,1,2,28 May 2006
Blood Diamond," Dark, Gritty and Downright Mean!
","I wanted to see this movie since the first time I saw a trailer for it back in the summer! The movie didn't disappoint! Danny Archer(DiCaprio) is a smuggler that needs to pay back a former friend after the diamonds he was smuggling were captured and lost to the military.Once in prison, he overhears a diamond mine leader question Solomon (Hounsou) about '... where is the big diamond?' That peaks Archer to push Solomon to show him the diamond and then all heck breaks loose!Obviously, the screenwriter injects a fictional storyline to tell the story of blood diamonds, or conflict diamonds in the Sierra Leone. It works and works well! Very violent and vicious in the telling but easily Oscar worthy performances from Hounsou and DiCaprio. Both were good and reacted well with one another! Hounsou was good because of Dicaprio and Dicaprio was good because of Hounsou! Just an awesome story and acting to boot... NO KIDS!! Don't even think about sneaking them in for this one!!! WAY TOO MEAN AND VIOLENT!!!",9,1,2,10 December 2006
Up," Up and away!
","My wife and I didn't know if we were going to see this Pixar/Disney film because it just didn't look all that interesting to me in the movie trailer... I was wrong! The movie is darker than any other Pixar movie and it has a more adult theme... keep that in mind if you are planning on bringing your children! The villain is VERY bad and the way they ended his character in the movie was not appropriate for children under 10! In fact, my wife and I were wondering why they didn't portray his character having an epiphany and turning back to good.All in all a very good movie, never drags and the story is quite sweet... but don't forget it is dark and mean at times and that could make it difficult for small children!",8,2,5,30 May 2009
Invincible," A touchdown for the producers on this feel good movie!
","A feel good movie that you can take your family to see!! The facts of the climatic ending are stretched a bit, but, this is Hollywood and it tells the story in a clean and tight way! Besides... who cares? We like the main character and want him to succeed and win for his friends, family and mostly himself by the end of the movie! I liked this movie more than I thought I would... being an old Dallas Cowboys fan, it was cool to see the producers cast actors that had the same build as the old Cowboys players of the 70's! I recognized the names of the Eagles players too and remembered their size and thought it was cool that they so closely cast actors to resemble those players! A great popcorn movie... go see it at the theater and if you want to add it to your DVD collection later, well, do that too because this movie is worth it!",8,1,2,3 September 2006
The Departed," Departed should have been DOA!
","Geez, I'm a Martin Scorsese fan and I've enjoyed just about every one of his movies but 'The Departed' was just a terrible piece of film work!Granted the acting was superb but that is about where it ends for me! This has got to be one of the meanest and dark movies ever made by Scorsese... just over the top with characters that anyone would walk on the other side of the street to avoid! When the movie goes out of its way to make our protagonist a victim and not allow him to get his life back, that's when it completely lost me! How much frigging realism do we need? He could have gotten the point across and not had Mark Whalberg's character be the only 'good' one left... all others were killed off! And, with Whalberg, you never liked him because of his attitude throughout the movie! Damon was good and Nicholson was his usual scene stealer self and Leo was in a league all his own, but the movie went 30 minutes too long and the ending was too awful to enjoy! No escapism for me here, just a reminder that we have really bad people in the world and some of them have taken a pledge to 'Protect and Serve'! This terrible piece of trash will get Scorsese his first Oscar because the Academy will award him more for his body of work than for this movie; I'm just afraid that once he wins, other filmmakers will feel the need to copy this movie's style and we'll see 100 clones of corrupt cops killing everyone that might remotely cross them! BLECH!",1,11,17,27 January 2007
Casino Royale," Bond has returned... heck, this is what Ian Fleming wrote him to be!
","OK... I've been a Bond fan all of my life and I've watched every movie so many times I can't even remember and I've long since given up hope that any of the movies will come close to the characterization of what Ian Fleming wrote... until now! I'll leave the particulars of the story to others, I'll just tell you that someone in Bondville woke up and decided to write a story that Ian Fleming would be proud to own! Bond is the way he is in all of the books! No smirkiness, no glib comebacks, no pithy remarks... no trace of the silliness that marked the Roger Moore years; he was an accurate interpretation of the books that Fleming wrote! Daniel Craig plays him as such and he doesn't miss the mark at all! If you are a true Bond fan, not just a fan of the movies but a fan of the books, then you'll enjoy this film! He's a bit undisciplined and crass and you wonder how many more mistakes he's going to make before he gets the bad guy! I liked this movie very much, but I'm giving it a 9 because of the running time. They could have shaved off 20 minutes and would have still had a great movie! That's its only fault in my opinion... too much movie! I can't wait to see the next installment to see how Craig's Bond will further morph into the suave, debonair spy we've all come to know and love!",9,1,3,18 November 2006
Click," In the spirit of Frank Capra!!!
","Adam Sandler seems to like the movies that have a happy ending and feel good throughout the flick... here it's no different.Sandler's character is a bogged down architect that has a snake of a boss (Hasselhoff) that pushes and pushes while waving a carrot in front of Sandler for promotion to get more and more from him. This works to get Adam Sandler's character to miss out on family events and avoid the process of work.As the 'Universal Remote' starts programming itself so he can avoid the things he dislikes the most, he finds himself fast forwarding through life and all it brings.The concept is simple and the meaning is not lost and you'll get an 'It's a Wonderful Life' feel at the ending! The cast is superb and you'll see many of the stock players from other Adam Sandler movies. Not a little kid movie, but definitely a teenager movie on up! Worth the price of admission... go and enjoy this movie, then buy it in time for the holidays!",8,1,4,24 June 2006
Valkyrie," They Came So Close...
","Being a history buff and reading about Valkyrie and the Colonel that was played by Tom Cruise so brilliantly, I was hoping for the best, but expecting much less... I was wrong! Even from the start when Kenneth Branaugh's character tried to sneak in a bomb in the cognac bottle on Hitler's plane which actually happened, I knew the producers had done their homework.Everything about Cruise's character was accurate down to the missing right hand and missing fingers. Eerily similar physically was Cruise to his character down to the hairstyle... very well played indeed! I don't know how movie goers will react to a psychological thriller set 64 years ago, but people should see this movie and see where the world was back then and how far we've come overall.Those few men and women put it all on the line for their country and paid for it with their lives. In actuality, over 200 were executed for that assassination attempt! Well made and well acted... I hope the Academy voters don't overlook this work; it would be a travesty if they did!",9,2,7,28 December 2008
V for Vendetta," Very disappointed with this whole movie!
","I'm sick and tired of Hollywood slapping my Christian beliefs down and portraying my personal beliefs as evil and non-tolerable! In their PC world it's OK to slam Christians as evil and hold high everyone else's beliefs as enlightened and progressive! How double standard can you get? I didn't have a clue as to what this movie was completely about when I stepped in the theater... if I did, I NEVER would have spent my money! Gratuitous action and sadistic scenes and a healthy hatred spewing from every corner of every frame all things Christian! Why doesn't Hollywood pick on some other religion? Why not pick religion that believes... um, I don't know... maybe that all others are infidels and should be wiped off the face of the earth? Does that ring a bell with anyone, or, will you continually spout your hatred until some weak-minded souls listen about their beliefs? Ms. Portman is Jewish and she was born in Isreal... how far does she need to look to find a true enemy to throw her hatred? If it wasn't for the United States supporting her homeland, where would Isreal be? She owes a lot from a nation that is built on Christian standards and beliefs!! No, can't recommend this movie... action OK, but, just tired of movie makers cramming their personal garbage in every frame of every movie I'm seeing lately! If this keeps up, I may quit my favorite past-time once and for all!!",1,7,24,25 March 2006
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Nobody got away from the teasing!
","I'll not rehash most of what others have said, but I'll hand it to Will Ferrell and company with this one, they made fun of EVERYBODY!!! They ribbed NASCAR, southerners, sponsors for race teams, the French, homosexuals, rednecks, absentee fathers, misbehaving children and religion! I've never heard as much satire in one movie in my entire life! Seeing Will swap spit with Sacha Cohen at the last was a bit much for me, but it did stay in the mood of the film! DON'T TAKE CHILDREN TO SEE THIS MOVIE!! It's crass, rude, somewhat sacrilegious and crude... but, I've got to say it is definitely funny!",7,0,2,6 August 2006
