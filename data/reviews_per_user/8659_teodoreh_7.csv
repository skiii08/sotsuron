The Lobster," Pure crap
","(Humor): The true story behind the movie is this: Director Yorgos Lanthimos was sitting on a tavern with his close friend and writer Efthymis Filippou. They were eating lobster. Suddenly, Lanthimos started to talk about how art is overrated and that people tend to pretend to understand as art even the weirdest nonsense just in order to show off and blend with the other intellectuals. Filippou on the other hand, strongly disagreed with his friend.At the end of their argument Lanthimos said that: 'Eftyhmi, I will show you that I'm right. I'm gonna make the stupidest movie you ever saw and people will love it'. Eftymis agreed to participate on this social experiment by writing part of the script.So they started planning on how they would make the stupidest movie ever, and present it as a masterpiece. <ul><li>Let's bring a Hollywood star who wants to play on a European production so as to add it to his 'to do' list. </li></ul><ul><li>Bring Colin Farrell - we will get Irish support from that! </li></ul><ul><li>Great idea, but how will we convince him to play on such a silly film? </li></ul><ul><li>Tell him that it is a very deep film with a European perspective and things like that.</li></ul><ul><li>Who else? </li></ul><ul><li>We need a famous guy who plays cheap comedy roles. Audience loves transformations. </li></ul><ul><li>Bring John C. Reilly, he will beg for this! </li></ul><ul><li>OMG. This is gonna be huge! Who else? </li></ul><ul><li>We'll bring actors from all over Europe, some Greeks some English, you name it. Don't forget we need money to produce this thing! </li></ul><ul><li>OK! But won't they have questions about the script? </li></ul><ul><li>I'm #$@%# Lanthimos, If I ask them to jump as kangaroos in front of the camera they will do it without second thoughts. And best part: They will be the firsts to believe that is art at its best. </li></ul><ul><li>LOL! How about the script? </li></ul><ul><li>Write whatever crazy boring thing you can think. </li></ul><ul><li>I have a great idea! </li></ul><ul><li>Hit it! </li></ul><ul><li>At a strange futuristic world, people have to be on a relationship or else must be transformed into animals. </li></ul><ul><li>Man this is pure gold! </li></ul><ul><li>..and our hero just broke up, so he goes on a special place where he is forced to find a new partner in 40 days or so, or else he will be converted to the animal of his choice. </li></ul><ul><li>This doesn't make ANY sense. It's f... awesome! </li></ul><ul><li>He chooses Lobster, because, well, we eat one right now! </li></ul><ul><li>LOL Mate! We will build a secondary story around this part, later. </li></ul><ul><li>OK. Now the matching process should be a bit complicated </li></ul><ul><li>Right, so as the audience starts wondering the real meaning. </li></ul><ul><li>Exactly. Let's say that the people on this dark world need to have same characteristics in order to mate. Also, as a daily activity, they go hunting for people who prefer to be single, because, why not? </li></ul><ul><li>And then? </li></ul><ul><li>Let's make a plot twist or something. Our hero fails to mate with a woman, and joins the free people who don't like relationships. </li></ul><ul><li>Dude, my mind is blowing up! </li></ul><ul><li>He fails there too, finds a girl, they try to escape from this madness and in the end... </li></ul><ul><li>What?? </li></ul><ul><li>I don't know. Let's make an end that nobody understands what it means so as to start theorizing about it. </li></ul><ul><li>Or even better, let's not write an end at all. Let people wonder. </li></ul><ul><li>Done? </li></ul><ul><li>Done!</li></ul>After a year 'Lobster' is presented to the world. The result?23 nominations and 14 wins. Lanthimos had successfully laughed on the back of the whole world.On a more serious note, the movie is bad. Very bad. Quite bad. It makes 'Highlander: Source' to look like masterpiece. Makes no sense at all and everybody has an opinion on how to translate this awful thing they just saw.",2,39,65,13 November 2016
Star Trek Into Darkness," Screenplay not original and somehow irritating for the older fans
","Star Trek Into Darkness is a nice movie to watch. Additionally, teenagers that weren't even born when 'Revenge of Khan' movie was released, won't notice anything bad about the screenplay.*Spoiler Alert* In my point of view, repeating two of the most famous StarTrek scenes in reverse mode, is irritating, sad and without a bit of originality. It's like trying to paint Mona Lisa again with a slightly different smile. You just can't do that! Producers could choose a really original script with new material, they should avoid some long boring scenes that you know how they will end anyways, and could focus on moving forward. They've chosen to go back instead - and that's not positive.So, using the same evil guy from older StarTrek movies, reversing the roles on key scenes, using same action scenes (the jump from Enterprise to the other ship) as previous movie is not a positive thing.Technically speaking, movie maintains high levels of special effects, but the whole package won't make you leave the room with a smile on your face - at least if you are a fan of the StarTrek universe..",7,1,3,12 July 2013
Suicide Squad," Trailers promised too much, that movie couldn't deliver
","Suicide Squad is not a bad superhero movie. But it's not the best. I think the first trailer promised too many things but the movie delivered too few. Sometimes you think it's the DC curse - those people seem to be unable to make a good movie while on the other side, Marvel makes blockbuster hits even from unknown to the general public super heroes like DeadPool.So let's start with the movie: One of the best parts of superhero movies is the initial introduction. See how beautifully every superhero was introduced on Avengers. on SSq. the introduction is weak and somehow tries to be psychedelic and funny but it's not. It's just, too badly edited.Then the 'dark' part every superhero movie has nowadays: The ethical dilemmas are somehow lost between serious dialogues and comic relief lines. In the end, it seems to be more of a movie for small kids.As for acting, surely Harley Quinn is the star here, and with her partner they seem to give some color to the story-line, but again, that's just not enough. For example Willy Smith is a veteran, but he's forced to make the STUPITEST come back ('I will help you accomplish your mission because I was touched by.. something') and that's not bad acting, it's just bad script.I think the problem is on all aspects of the film (editing, script and directing) and it's a common DC movie problem, the fact that they are REALLY in a hurry to unify their universe like Marvel does, but it is SO irritating the way they do it.Even on Avengers 2, there were script problems and stupid ethical dilemmas that intended to make the movie a bit darker. S.Sq, tries to make everything dark in a ridiculous way. It's a mixed messages situation, and in the end you can't take any part of it seriously. Btw, same problem was present on 'Batman vs Superman'. I am not sure why writers want nowadays to paint heroes so dark while they are not. Spoiler: The SuicideSquad talks on the bar about killing people. Harley Quinn is so sensitive about the death of the family of her fellow soldier, but in the end, a dozen of prison guards die so as she can escape (and a whole bunch of others die on Joker's first attempt). Yes she's psychedelic, but people miss the point here - if a point was intended to exist.The biggest worries is that the next DC movies (with the Aquaman being introduced twice so far) will continue this bad bad tactic. DC movies get worse and worse.",6,0,1,30 August 2016
Interstellar," Great movie but not a masterpiece
","First of all I need to say that it is quite rare to see a decent sci-fi movie. Interstellar is a great movie because it tries to be as accurate as possible regarding scientific facts.But it's not a masterpiece because of small glitches left and right on the movie. For example, the 'Lost Pilot who - by almost an accident - got back to NASA (and they accepted him because he was the best)' looks like a cheap TV show rather than good script. I know that this gets explained later, but still, not good overall impression.The other problem is that the Director repeats the same effects from previous movies, like Inception. And the scene where worm-hole travel is explained is actually stolen from Alien.Ofc those aren't huge script problems, and there's still originality on it. For example, Prometheus was terrible IMHO, because it followed step-by-step the same things that happened on previous Alien movies. On the other hand, there are even better (=you don't know what to expect) scripts like District9's.Imho, the problem is not the fact that Interstellar steals sfx or ideas from Contact or Inception. The one thing that keeps this moving from being a classic sci-fi is the fact that it has a clean and absolute happy end. Did anyone understood what happened to '2001: A Space Odyssey'? On Contact, did we communicated again with Aliens? Did Neo liberated all people on the original Matrix? (no). Bladerunner? You need to let something to the imagination of people (like the end of Inception) instead of trying to reach the absolute and not disputable happy end.",8,1,5,22 November 2014
Avengers: Endgame," It was good, but not as good as Thor 3 or Infinity War
","There was so much hype about this movie. The social media made a good deal of fuzz about the ticket records it broke, its length etc, etc.To start with the obvious: It's not a bad Marvel Movie. But it's surely not the best. Regarding the script and the pace, I think it reminds me something like Avengers 2 and Thor 2 and that's not the best movies Marvel made.To me, Thor 3 is the best movie of all Marvel Universe, because it has a super good balance between action, dialogs, script, and humor. You never felt bored, you never felt you knew what's coming.On Endgame, sometimes I felt bored. It was a combination of medicre editing, script or acting. For example, fat Thor joke wasn't halve as good as bad haircut Thor. The scenes that should produce laughs, were between average and good.Although 3 hours long, it failed to show the extension of misery the planet has fallen into. In the opening scenes they easily kill Thanos, next scene misery, third scene hope, fourth scene Stark rejects the idea of time travel, next scene he finds the solution, next scene, the machine is ready. It's the very same Tony Stark that on Iron Man 2 spend half a movie trying to figure out how to create a new element.Time travel movies are always problematic because no matter how much mumbo jumbo terminology you add, the truth is that no matter how the heroes avoid to interact or change the future, their own existance on the past will change their universe. So, Endgame can laugh about Hot Tub Time Machine, but the truth is, it is still a HTTM movie.. ;DAlso, it's disappointing to continiously upgrade Thor's powers and on the final battle scenes, to take them back without a proper explanation. Thor easily defeated a Thanos that was on the maximum of his powers using the Infinity Gauntled on Infinity War, but on Endgame, he's unable to beat him even without Thanos having full power! That's silly.Yes it's a huge movie and even with 30 second cameos from top actors like Robert Redford or Michael Douglas you should need 1 hour for all characters but in the end, it's not about how many people you will squeeze into the movie. It's about how you will build a good pace with balanced action and humor.Maybe it's about the fact that everybody pretty much knew how things would end while on other movies like Thor 3, things were a bit more chaotic. Maybe it's because there wasn't much time about showing the details of a 5 year period. Maybe it was the fact that the first memory that jumps into my mind every time I recall the movie is Black Widow standing on a desk and coordinating x-avengers. Maybe is the fact that Thor from an arrogant young person, became super-strong in 5 movies (Thor 1,2,3, Avengers 1,2) and then, back to mediocre again. Maybe is the fact that Hulk was portrayed like the Beast from X-Men now. Maybe it was because we never got answers from the previous movie, like what Loki meant when he talked about the sun rising again, or why Hulk refused to help Banner. Even on this movie, Hawkeye becoming a renegade, makes no sense. All heroes that presented a second chance (Stark, Thor, Hawkeye) react like 'Nah, I will pass' instead of be super-excited about it. I know 5 years passed, but the movie fails to show how this period changed our heroes.Thanos final fight on Infinity War, much inferior to that of Endgame.
Humor much much inferior to Thor3.Of course it is not a bad movie, but it could epic - and despite all those Anchorman cameos, it's not. But I guess, when you have limited time to repeat a wordwide success, surely you will have fails now and then.Endgame was destined to be an epic ending. It was. But only 8 out of 10.",8,6,12,2 May 2019
The Favourite," At least, on his previous movies, Lanthimos was bad.
","Let's review Lanthimo's career so far:* Dogtooth: A story of a totally disfunctional family, ok, not bad at all.* Lobster: A story based on a totally illogical thing that never gets explained, in order to show to the audience, the real nature of relations. Ok, I can bite that too.* The killing of the sacret deer: A story also based on a totally illogical thing that never gets explained, in order to create a parallelism (?) to a ancient Greek Tragedy. I've eaten before the same food!* The Favorite: A boring movie.
I can't stop thinking that the ONLY new thing the movie can bring on a hill of previous movies, is:<ul><li>Freaking scratching of violins or whatever is this terrible sound, Lanthimos wants to put on all of his movies.</li></ul><ul><li>Wide lens experimentation like he's a 19y old art-school student on a project.</li></ul>The story is very similar to dozen of other stories, photography is good, acting is very good, but boring pace, irritating sound and no meaning, makes this movie, idk, boring? At least there's not a supernatural rule or ability on it. So I'm guessing, after 5-6 movies, Lanthimos will stop using violins and he will get bored using all of his lens. Who knows, he may even steal time from self-admiration and use his powers to write and direct a decent interesting movie!",5,2,3,17 December 2019
Parasite," Parasite is not a valid title for this brilliant movie
","It's a nice-to-watch movie and nice-to-think afterwards of what you've just saw.At first, it feels you are watching a single-sided comedy, in which a family of poor-devils manage to build a scam against naive rich people. But, 45 minutes later, you see something different.It is a very strong contrast to see the father of the family on the same scene, trying to save everything he has from his flooded house, while on the next scene, he has to pretend that everything is ok.The ending is not the best I could think of, I guess, rich people will keep living and poor people will keep dreaming.Very strong and meaningful pictures, painting a country that is supposed to be of the wealthiest in the world, showing that the barrier between rich and poor people is opening everywhere. The main characters is like they're living in North Korea if you think of it!Finally, I think the description of all characters wants to show that nobody is good or evil, nobody is right or wrong. It's just the situations that make us react the way we do. I am not even quite sure who's the parasite. Poor people who discover a window for (a better) living or rich people who take advantage of lower-class people in order to obtain their wealth, not knowing how it is, to be poor?",8,23,43,17 December 2019
