Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," Foul Film
","I HATED the movie, and I laughed all through it. Interestingly, despite it is humorous, it is degrading. I hated it because it's low-grade humor: bodily function, bathroom humor; bigotry; shock-jock-type of appeal. It is reminiscent of Andrew Dice Clay and Howard Stern.It's cheap. We, as a society, can do much better, and we have in the past.I can appreciate the skill used in compiling the film for what it is, but the degrading status yet remains.There are higher forms of humor, more appropriate for humankind. Someone said it better than I can: 'A culture is only as great as its dreams, and its dreams are dreamed by artists. When the level of existence of the artist becomes impure, so becomes impure the art itself to the deterioration of the society.'",1,17,36,6 November 2006
