The Devil's Advocate," This movie never should have been made.
","I had such high expectations for this movie.  I just wanted to see it because Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors.  I don't know what kept me hanging on until the end.  But, I had no idea that I was in for a travesty. The Devil's Advocate is an insult to Al Pacino and his fans! Keanu Reeves plays this overly ambitious hot-shot lawyer who turns a blind eye to the fact that his boss is the devil himself.    Charlize Thereon plays his 'damsel-in-distress' wife who acts totally imcompetent.  The lamest part of this movie was that scene about the jogger, and I won't even get into details.  It's just not worth it. The Devil's Advocate looks a lot like a movie directed by Ed Wood!  If you are an Al Pacino fan, RUN, HIDE!  Keep away from this movie at all costs!  See 'The Insider' , 'Dog Day Afternoon', or 'Scarface' if you want to see a good Al Pacino movie.  Besides, I never liked horror movies, anyway.",Null,0,2,31 January 2002
The Blair Witch Project," Excellent!
","I really liked this movie!  If you're in the mood for a scary movie, this is the one!  I don't normally like scary movies, but I really enjoyed this one!  I didn't get a chance to see it in the theaters because it was all jam-packed.  But I waited for it to come to video instead!  And was it worth the wait!  Heather, Josh, and Michael were all good actors in this.  After this movie was made, those three didn't die of mysterious deaths, they become millionaires!  Who knows?  We might see one of them in a real movie!  Also, this movie was all pretend, there never was a legend of the 'Blair Witch' it was just something they made up, but everyone who's seen it already knew that!  That's why it's so intriguing!  So, if you're in the mood for horror, rent this!  You'll be glad you did!",Null,0,0,28 November 1999
Scarface," Al Pacino is in rare form!
","In Scarface, Al Pacino plays Tony Montana.  A Cuban exile with a bad history who considers himself a 'political prisoner' goes to Miami to get involved with drug smuggling.  Tony really gets his wish to make the American dream come true so along the way he becomes a very fearsome, bloodthirsty drug kingpin.  I've always enjoyed Al Pacino's work.  He knows how to play any character and earn a standing ovation.  It's any wonder why this movie was so popular to begin with!   One of the best lines was, 'Say Hello to My Little Friend!'  Even Michelle Pfiffer was good as the cynical moll Elvira.  Even if this movie was tremendously violent, it's not as violent as those ludicrious teen horror flicks that are popular right now.  Even such popular movies like American Pie, Lord of the Rings, and I Know What You Did Last Summer all fail in comparison to Scarface.  It's the best gangster flick since The Godfather trillogy.   So, forget Once Upon A Time in America!  Scarface is where it's at!  I give Scarface 5 stars!",Null,0,1,16 October 2003
The Ring," Best horror flick since The Blair Witch Project.
","Noami Watts plays a cynical reporter and Martin Henderson plays her ex-flame.  They both must find out what the cause of the impending death of anyone who watches a mysterious video tape.  They find out that the video was linked to a mentally ill horse tamer and her unstable daughter.  Unlike some horror flicks that have an endless array of blood, gore, and violence, The Ring has a plot that's more consolidated, and not so nonsenical.  The Ring really has lived up to it's hype.  It's a horror movie that's actually good.   The location shots of the Pacific Northwest were breathtaking.  Even if you don't care for horror movies, The Ring is still a great movie to watch with friends or family.  It's worth seeing again and again.  It may as well be The Blair Witch Project of 2002!  I give The Ring 5 stars!",Null,1,1,16 October 2003
As Good as It Gets," Oscar nomination? Give me a break!
","If anything 'As Good as It Gets' should've got nominated for a Razzy! Jack Nicolson plays a cumdurgeon who has obsessive-compulsive disorder and is a real demon around his neighbors until he finds love with a waitress (Helen Hunt).  There's absolutely nothing amusing or original about this movie.  And the Monty Python song in this movie wasn't no reference, if anything it was an insult to Monty Python!Jack Nicolson is such a talented actor!  Why did he and Cuba Gooding Jr. waste their talents on this trash of a movie?  Another reason why I dislike this movie is because of the homosexual stereotypes, and it makes obsessive-compulsive disorder look like a joke.  Thank heavens Titanic beat this movie at the Oscars.  The only likeable character in this movie is the dog!  Steer clear away from As Good As It Gets.  See some of Jack Nicolson's and Cuba Gooding Jr's other movies.  This is the second worst movie of 1997 next to 'The Devil's Advocate'.",Null,0,1,27 August 2002
The Mummy," A Tongue in Cheek Adventure.
","Brendan Fraser is one of my many favorite actors.  In The Mummy he plays the hero Rick O'Connell.  It's the story about a sarcophogus that's accidently released and wreaks havoc until it captures a librarian (Rachel Weisz) to make him invincible.  I really enjoyed this movie because of the action, suspense, romance, and it's over the top humor.  The Mummy has something in it for anyone to enjoy.  It's no wonder this movie was popular during it's theatrical release.  The lead female character was actually smart and tough.  The antagonist Beni and the girl's older brother (John Hanna) were wimps!   Brendan Fraser sure has come a lot way since 'Encino Man'.  I also liked some of his other movies, too and I'll see the sequel when I get the chance.  In conclusion The Mummy is a very captivating and enjoyable movie.  Catch it if you can!  I hope to see more of Brendan Fraser's work in the future.",Null,0,0,4 February 2002
The Aviator," Leonardo DiCapprio does it again!
","The Aviator is an excellent movie, and the acting was superb. Leonardo DiCapprio plays millionaire Howard Hughes who first started off making movies such as 'Hell's Angels' and then moved onto to make airplanes. Cate Blanchet's performance as Katherine Hepburn was incredible, that you can see the striking resemblance between them.Also, this movie focuses on Howard Hughes's obsessive perfectionism. He wanted everything to be just perfect, and Leonardo DiCapprio pulled of the performance without a hitch! Howard Hughes was also famous for making the Spruce Goose, which is now a historical landmark! Too bad The Aviator didn't win an Oscar for Best Picture, seeing this movie you can see why it was Oscar worthy to begin with. I hope to see Leonardo DiCapprio in more great movies in the future. I give The Aviator 4 stars!",10,1,2,1 March 2005
The Bourne Identity," Matt Damon does it again!
","Matt Damon delivers a riveting performace as Jason Bourne, a man who's wanted by assassins and suffering from memory loss.  Along the way he gets a woman to help him, they drive around Europe, hide out when ever they can, and both are wanted by the authorities.  The coolest scene in the movie was the car chase scene, I've always had an affinity for car chase movies. Critics have even compared it to Gene Hackman's car chase scene in 'The French Connection'.  It was that great!  I also liked the chemistry between Matt Damon and the actress, her name escapes me, though.  This psychological thriller will keep you on the edge of your seat, and if you're a Matt Damon fan like me!  An astonishing movie from beginning to end.  It's the best movie of this year so far!  I give The Bourne Identity 4 stars!   I hope to see Matt Damon in more great movies to come in the future!  Maybe he'll even be in the next Kevin Smith movie!",Null,0,1,26 June 2002
The Italian Job," The Ultimate Caper Flick!
","The remake of the 1969 movie The Italian Job has something in it for everyone.  Very unique for a caper flick such as this.  A gang of thieves who start a heist in the Italian alps get sidetracked by a rival gang and it's a race to the finish!  This film has action, humor, romance, drama, filmed in exotic locations, and an awesome car chase!  The Italian Job is sure to keep anyone on the edge of their seat!  The best characters were played by Seth Green and Charlize Theron.     I would suggest this remake to the original.  It's not very often that remakes are better than the original, and The Italian Job takes the cake. Highly recommended!  You'll root, laugh, and cheer thoughout the whole movie!  Great to watch with friends and family on a Friday Night.  Great acting and a powerful script.  Best movie of 2003!  Rent it!",Null,0,1,5 May 2004
The Village," Excellent movie worth seeing
","From the creator of 'Signs' and 'The Sixth Sense' comes The Village. In this movie it centers around an isolated Amish-like close-knit community who's being terrorized by mythical creatures. The people call the creatures, 'Those we don't speak of'. The character of Ivy the blind girl was very resilient. Joaquin Pheonix was great in this, it's amazing how he has matured as an actor over the years.Adrien Brody's character Noah Percy was the main attraction. Adrien Brody is awesome in any role he plays. If you're a fan of horror flicks, or even if you're not check out The Village. It's a great movie you won't regret seeing. I give it 4 stars.",10,0,1,20 April 2005
Ocean's Eleven," This was one cool movie!
","I've always got a kick out of these heist movies.  But Ocean's Eleven tops them all.  In this one, George Clooney plays a man who recently got out of prison and plans to have the biggest robbery in Las Vegas, and to try to make amends with his wife.  He teams up with an all-star cast, Andy Garcia, Matt Damon, Brad Pitt, and Julia Roberts.   Ocean's Eleven deserves a standing ovation!  It even has some comical moments, too.  I liked Matt Damon's reluctance in his character, and George Clooney is always cool in anything he does.  Julia Roberts says this was the one movie she had fun making.  This Ocean's 11 is better than the original with Frank Sinatra.  My favorite scenes were when the fat guy was pretending to beat up George Clooney and the way Clooney and Damon tried to steal the money by climbing down those ropes, and when the circus contortionist got stuck.  And just all of it was just very enjoyable and entertaining from beginning to end.  It's such a shame this movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar, but it did get nominated for a Golden Globe, I believe.  Either way, you won't be let down by this movie.  I give Oceans Eleven 5 stars!",Null,0,0,13 May 2002
"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"," A true martial arts masterpiece!
","I heard Ang Lee was encouraged by his mother and sisters to make this movie.  And what an outstanding job he did!  In Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, the storyline is set in the 18th century China.  A sword gets stolen by an the evil Jade Fox, who's training a revolutionary princess who's destiny is to become a warrior.  Along the way, the princess fights everyone who stands in her way and even gets a boyfriend.  And her family struggles to bring her back.     Michelle Yeoh's performance was exceptional, and I salute the young actress who played the princess, I forget her name and I hope we can see her in more movies in the near future. (So, move over, Britney Spears!) I think every actor and actress did a great job in this movie.  I also loved the spectacular special effects, and there's a lot of wire-woo that this defies the law of gravity, in a good way.     I was totally angered at the fact that lame FOX sitcom 'Grounded for Life' had to parody this movie, that was one of the biggest insults to this movie I have ever seen.  Also, I think this is a good movie to show to young girls, to teach them that leading female counterparts and girls and women in real life too are not all damsels-in-distress and shreiking violets waiting for their prince to come.   Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon deserved the Oscar.  Though it did win some awards, though.  And a movie like this doesn't deserve to be ridiculed. This is a movie every female should see.  Want to see real girl power in action?  CTHD is the movie to watch!  So rent it today!",Null,0,0,6 August 2001
Million Dollar Baby," Good in the beginning, Bad in the end.
","I still have a lot of respect for Clint Eastwood. He's a very accomplished actor of his time. When he did Million Dollar Baby, it was scraping at the bottom of the barrell. In this one he plays a boxing trainer who's on a guilt trip about his daughter. It never specifies what exactly he did to his daughter. Morgan Freeman's performance was the usual narrative state he's best known for. Hillary Swank plays a female boxer determined to achieve her dream of being a boxer. So she asks Clint Eastwood's character to train her, at first he's hesitant. I didn't like Maggie's trailer trash family, either.It was good in the beginning when he was training her and bonding with her like she was his daughter, then once she finally achieved her dream, the boxer sucker punches Maggie and she becomes paralyzed. Then she protests by biting off her tongue. Plus, this movie sparked a lot of controversy about euthanasia, and the right to die. The best example of this was the Terri Schaivo case. Million Dollar Baby should not have won the Oscar. The Aviator should've won instead. Clint Eastwood as good of an actor he is, he could've done better. This whole movie could've been better. See one of his other movies instead. Stay completely away from Million Dollar Baby. It will just be a big disappointment.",Null,0,2,7 April 2005
Dumb and Dumber," Worst of the Jim Carrey movies.
","Being a Jim Carrey fan myself, after having seeing this movie during it's theatrical release, I thought, he could've done a better movie than Dumb and Dumber.  In this one, Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels play these inept and incredibly stupid best friends who come across a suitcase and set out to Colorado to give it back to a woman (Lauren Holly) whom Lloyd eventually falls for.  And they get entangled in a kidnapping plot.   I didn't like this movie because it was way too vulgar and lowbrow.  The worst part of all was when Lloyd spikes Harold's drink with a liquid laxative and later on Harold gets stuck in the bathroom for obvious reasons that are too ribald for me to explain.  This whole movie was a disgrace and an insult to such an advanced, talented, and charismatic comedian that Jim Carrey is.     To add insult to injury: This movie, when it was out in theaters became the number one movie in America and the favorite Jim Carrey movie amongst fans.  Even my friends and co-workers thought this movie was funny.  I understand why someone would like this movie, and that's okay with me.  But I suggest some better Jim Carrey movies like Ace Ventura parts 1 & 2, Cable Guy, Batman Forever, Man on the Moon, Me, Myself, and Irene, and The Truman Show.  This movie is totally brainless, if you don't like vulgarity then my best advice is to skip it!  I give Dumb and Dumber 1 star.",Null,3,6,20 March 2001
Black Hawk Down," Excellent war movie!
","Black Hawk Down tells the fact based story of the war between the U.S. and Somolia in October 1993.  Tom Sizemore's role in this was exceptional, and I also liked him in the sadly cancelled Robbery Homicide Division.  As your watching you can see this movie gives the message of how raw, cruel, graphic, and deadly war can really be.     Black Hawk Down is everything you ever wanted for a impeccable war movie. A realistic plot, action, suspense, a cool soundtrack, and a variety of characters played by an all-star cast.  So, forget Saving Private Ryan, if you want to see a war movie, see Black Hawk Down.  I give it 3 stars.",Null,0,1,26 February 2003
The Insider," In a word: amazing!
","This movie tells the true story of Lowell Burgman, a 60 Minutes producer who has his work cut out for him when he has interviews.  He also interviewed Russell Crowe's character who happened to work for the tabacco industry and how their relationship grew into a media blitz.  I won't reveal much.   I especially enjoyed Christopher Plummer's performance as Mike Wallace. Michael Mann did a brilliant job directing this movie about exposing the naked truth about the tabacco industry and so forth. Even though this movie was based on a true story, some parts were fictionalized.  But it's still an excellent movie that's worth checking out.     What this movie boiled down to was exposing the truth can indeed be dangerous sometimes.  If you're in the mood for a drama that's also based on actual events, this is the movie for you.  :)",Null,0,0,1 November 2000
Once Upon a Time in America," Sergio Leone's worst movie.
","Once Upon a Time in America never should have been made.  If you're a fan of Sergio Leone's movies, see his westerns instead.  At least those movies were original.  Here, we have an all-star cast who all act like a bunch of stereotypical psychopathic gangsters who hate women and murder for a living. This movie was in the Top #200 on imdb?  Give me a break! 
   The worst part of the movie was the part about the baby switch and Danny Aiello's perfomance was downright abymsal.  One minute he's telling his wife and daughters he loves them, then the next, he screams at his poor family about how his baby son is going to be the 'other boss of the house'.   This movie must've been underwritten by Stereotypes Incoporated.  Plus the over the top acting, cheesy dialogue, and the dismal soundtrack and just about everything else about Once Upon a Time in America are all the ingredients for a poorly done gangster movie.  Oh, and we were also left in the dark about James Wood's character getting his face burned.  Whatever happened there?   Watch The Godfather trilogy if you want to see some good gangster movies.  RUN!  Don't walk about from the garbage!  And keep right on running!",Null,7,15,5 December 2002
The Mummy Returns," Awesome sequel!
","The Mummy Returns is better than the first!  Our hero Rick O'Connell and his now wife Evelyn now have a son who gets into a mishap that accidently releases Imhotep who kidnaps their son.  All the original characters from the first movie all go on a big enticing adventure to defeat Imhotep and save their son!  The son is like both is parents.  Rachel Weisz and Brenden Fraser make an excellent team!  Rachel Weisz is like a British version of Yancy Butler from Witchblade.   The special effects are very innovative, the adventure is very edgy, and of course like the first Mummy movie the humor is subtle.  If you're a Brenden Fraser fan, check out The Mummy Returns, and it's predessesor! That's The Rock who played the Scorpion King, you can tell it's him the way he's been digitally enhanced.  Rick O'Connell puts Indiana Jones to shame! I give both Mummy movies 4 stars each!  I hope to see both Brenden Fraser and Rachel Weisz in more movies in the future!",Null,0,0,2 September 2002
A Beautiful Mind," No wonder this movie won an Oscar!
","A Beautiful Mind was a superb autobiography of Princeton Professor Jon Nash.  Russell Crowe gave an outstanding performance as the lead role, and Jennifer Connelly was good as the sainted wife who stood by.  Jon Nash was a genius who has had to battle schizophrenia since he was a student at Princeton.  Of all the times he hallucinates about his 'friend', Ed Harris's character, and the little girl you somehow want to believe it's real.  But it's not happening.  (i.e.  The car chase scene, and the fact he though he was a government agent.)  The movie itself can also be sad and frightning at times.   Ron Howard sure has come a long way since Opie from The Andy Griffith Show.  Also another reason why he made this movie was because one of his family members is schizophrenic, too, like Jon Nash.  So, if you're tired of all those nonsensical ne'er-do-well teen/college student movies, or just want to see something that actually won an Oscar, then check out A Beautiful Mind.  May Russell Crowe's acting career take him to newer and better heights!  I give it 4 stars.",Null,0,2,30 April 2002
Ray," Great biopic of Ray Charles
","Jamie Foxx was excellent as Ray Charles. This movie depicts his life story from his traumatic childhood living in poverty, getting his start in music, struggling marriage, stardom, and drugs and self-destruction. Ray is a movie every one should see, even if you're not a fan of his music. After this movie, I bought the Ray Charles Collection CD, and my whole family loved it.Jamie Foxx deserved the Oscar for his role as Ray Charles. The resemblance was uncanny. In case nobody knew, Jamie Foxx went to a music school in his early days. It's a great start for Jamie Foxx to be in this movie because there's more to him that just a comedian. My favorite songs were 'Georgia', 'What'd I Say', and 'Hit the Road Jack'! I give Ray 5 stars!",10,1,2,7 April 2005
Gangs of New York," Oscar worthy!
","If you don't want to see Leonardo DiCapprio in a negative review, see Gangs of New York instead of that inane tripe Catch Me if You Can. Martin Scorcese tells the tale about the turf war between Anglo-Saxons and the Irish in New York City in the 1860's.  Daniel Day Lewis should have got the Oscar for his role as the notorious, charismatic butcher who kills Amsterdam's father.     Daniel Day Lewis's performance also comes off as comical at times.  It's hard to believe that Cameron Diaz was in a horrid movie like 'A Life Less Ordinary' to something that was Oscar worthy like Gangs of New York. Leonardo DiCapprio is the glue that holds this picture together, his performance as Amsterdam the gang leader determined to avenge his father's death was extrordinary.  I also heard somewhere that Scorcese wanted to make this movie 20-some years ago.  Gangs of New York is a movie everybody should see.  It gives a good history lesson as well.",Null,0,1,8 October 2003
The Bourne Supremacy," This sequel is superior to it's predecessor
","Matt Damon is back as Jason Bourne. This time he is in Europe, and he's framed by the CIA. Plus, he's forced to go back to his life as an assassin to survive. The sequel is superior to the original 'The Bourne Identity'. It's full of action-packed thrills that sure to please any fans of action/adventure flicks.Matt Damon is excellent in any movie he's in and the roles he plays, that's why he's a popular actor of his time. The car chase scene in this one has been compared to the scene in 'Bullitt'. This car chase scene is sure to keep you on the edge of your seat, it's longer and more fast paced. The Bourne Supremacy is more proof that sequels can be better than the predeceasing movie. See this for the action, location shots of Europe, and Matt Damon. I give The Bourne Supremacy 4 stars!",9,5,8,20 April 2005
Cinderella Man," Another Oscar Worthy performance from Russell Crowe.
","I love boxing movies! Forget 'Million Dollar Baby' and 'Against The Ropes', Cinderella Man takes the cake! Russell Crowe gives a powerhouse performance as Jim Braddock. A boxer who struggled to make ends meet to provide for his family during The Great Depression. He goes against a lot of boxers, including Max Baer, the famous boxer who's son went on to play Jethro from The Beverly Hillbillies. While he's struggling to get a job after injuring his hand, his family suffers from poverty, and has to go look for work. I recommend this movie for boxing fans, Russell Crowe fans, or fans of the sports genre. Too bad Cinderella Man only came in at #4 on the Top 5 Box Office. It should have won an Oscar. Russell Crowe should'V got the Oscar for his performance. Excellent movie!",10,3,4,16 September 2006
Jurassic Park," Overrated for it's time. But a good movie.
","Even though this was the most overrated movie of 1993, when I saw Jurassic Park in the theaters back then, I actually liked it.  But the plot was very thin, it was so comprehensible that a idiot with the mental capacity of a 6 year old would understand it!  A child under 10 can watch this movie and understand it!     When Jurassic Park came out, immediately came the cashing in on the merchindise!  Everything from Jurassic Park beach towels, toothbrushes, lunchboxes, water bottles, toys, action figures, t-shirts, jackets, and even a video game for Sega!  Even some resturants joined in on the craze!  Just everything product you can think of had to be Jurassic Park related.  You couldn't walk into a mall without seeing any JP products within 30 yards of a distance!     But despite all of that, what's not to like?  The one thing I didn't like about this movie was that whiny teenage girl who was scared all the time and acted like an advocate for political correction!  But throw in some decent acting, well-known actors, innovative special effects, action, adventure, and Jurassic Park is quite a ride!  A fun movie for all ages!  I give it 3 stars!",Null,0,2,1 August 2001
"O Brother, Where Art Thou?"," You'll laugh! You'll cry!
","The Coen Brothers do it again!  This is their best movie since Raising Arizona!  This movie was based on the tale of Homer's The Oddessy, in a 1930's setting in the Deep South.  Three bumbling and inept convicts escape from a chain gang to find a treasure.  They get into a lot of mishaps, and they meet a variety of characters who bare resemblence to the characters from the original Oddessy.  (i.e. the singing whores were supposed to be The Sirens.)  George Clooney gives an outstanding performance as Ulysess.  George Clooney is great in whatever movies he makes, which is probably why he has captivated so many fans (like me) since his role as Dr. Ross on ER.  O Brother Where Art Thou is a heart-touching, riveting, and uplifting movie. It's one of those movies you can watch over and over again.  I give it 4 stars!",Null,1,1,4 February 2002
The Godfather," Seeing this movie is an offer you can't refuse!
","I saw this movie for the first time when I was 17.  The best part was the wedding!  The Godfather is one of my favorite movies, part 2 was cool, too! This movie isn't only about a Mafia power struggle, it also focuses on honoring and looking out for the family, and not to mention the Italian culture!  I've spent a lot of my summers during my childhood in Italy.  So, I understood what was happening when Sonny was beating up on Connie's abusive husband and when Michael warned Fredo in Vegas never to go against his family.  The Corleones were a very close, tight family who looked out for each other and stood up for one another during Mafia battles and other conflicts as well.  And it all boiled down to honoring the family! 
 I was also rooting for Michael when he took down Sollozo and the Police Chief!  Al Pacino is one of my favorite actors, and was excellent in this, and in a lot of his other movies, too.  So, if you haven't seen this movie, please go and rent it!  You might like it, or maybe you won't.  But it's still worth seeing.",Null,1,5,2 December 1999
