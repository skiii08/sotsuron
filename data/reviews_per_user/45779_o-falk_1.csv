Alien 3," Fincher did great!
","I can't believe everyone who keeps saying that Alien 3 brought the saga to a halt (not because of ending). I think that Alien 3 is a lot cooler than the original movie but it still carries that classic fear of a just 1 single creature (which went lost in Camerons 'Aliens', though this movie turned out as the best of all anyway so it doesn't really matter)...I know the story that says Fincher himself never liked the movie. And I guess it's not as amazing as he's later productions ('The Game', 'Seven', 'Fight Club' etc.) but it still turned out as a very important part of the saga, and it really is a GOOD movie. And this is an early Fincher-flick, we can't judge him based upon his later productions. He didn't have all those movies behind him at the time of Alien 3. So stop thinking 'DAVID FINCHER'S Alien 3', instead, try to think of it as 'David Fincher's ALIEN 3'. It's just another movie. And I think fincher did great. After all, The first movie was epic, the second movie was like the first one kicked up to a speed of 300 lightyears per second, and it added more action to the saga than T2 did for the Terminator serie. Now take another look at Alien 3. Remember the Alien in the ceiling chasing after the prisoners as they atempt to lour it into the furnace. Remember Bishops shredded corpse taken of a local garbageheep. Remember Ripley's shaved head. This is kick-ass movie! And as far as Ripley-fans should be concerned; isn't this the greatest Ripley portrated through out the saga? I mean, Girl power a side... the Ripley clone in episode 4 almost felt silly, but in Alien 3? Ripley could sit down and arm-wrestle the queen herself based purely on that shaved-head-look. And she would take the queen down. Period.PS. I can't wait to see the Directors Cut version (ooohps, sorry, that should be 'extended workprint'-version) that should be included in the ALIEN QUADRILOGY boxset due available sometime around november (?).DS",Null,0,3,21 July 2003
