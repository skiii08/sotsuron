The Blair Witch Project," Overrated...?
","Nah! I finally saw this film in its entirety - and I've got to say to all the haters: for those of you who thought it was boring; for those of you who thought it was jumbled, incoherent, and uneventful...you must realize that IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE MADE LIKE THAT!! Any other way of constructing the story and the individual sequences would have, at the very least, watered down the fright factor a bit.I must say I was surprised by how genuinely creeped out I was at times when viewing this film - mostly due to the glaring lack of clich√©d musical cues and ambient noise. I felt that was the absolute strongest aspect of 'The Blair Witch Project', a raw, unpleasant journey into the woods captured on film by three young 'filmmakers' who somehow 'disappeared' as their 'documentary' was being shot. Losing the map, fighting amongst companions, the discovery of random odd signs in the woods - most notably the film's trademark stick symbols - and more all serve to heighten the unbelievable realism of this infamous voyeuristic drama. I feel it deserves its cult status as one of the greatest and most original horror films ever made. It's obvious why many people saw such potential for imitation and mockery (mostly just for that signature 'I'm so scared' teary-eyed Heather close-up). 'The Blair Witch Project', however, cannot be called such a disaster. It's certainly a unique viewing experience, and for that I must commend it for its approach, and its lasting legacy.",Null,0,1,1 November 2003
"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," I'll never look at those three guys the same way again...
","...and that's a GOOD thing. Basically, before I truly became aware of 'Priscilla', I had only thought of its three central actors as just regular, boring guys who were fine enough at acting, but really weren't anything special. Wrong. I had heard about this mysterious movie once or twice, but had no idea who was in it, nor what it was about (beyond the rather vague concept of drag queens/transvestites), and when I decided to read more about it, and find out who was in the cast - SURPRISE! Guy Pearce (of whom I had had a bad first impression when I discovered him in that travesty 'The Time Machine'), Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith himself!!!), and Terence Stamp (whom I don't think I ever saw in any films, but whom I still knew a fair bit about)! How genius is that? I had to see this to believe it, and when I did, I was not let down! Beautiful scenes, costumes, dialogue and music made this probably one of the most interesting and memorable movie experiences of my life! I wasn't the least bit uptight about it (as some people were turned off by the flamboyant behaviour and distasteful jokes, which I found refreshingly great!), and delighted in the campy antics of this fantastic trio! It's a beautiful, feel-good comedy that I recommend to anyone with a catty sense of humour (and a VERY open mind).",Null,67,84,13 August 2003
Minority Report," For me, the best film of the summer of 2002 - if not the best film of the YEAR!
","Wow...I really couldn't react any other way when I saw this futuristic masterpiece a little over a year ago. Now that it's been that long since its initial release (and after I purchased and viewed the DVD many times) I'm not really surprised now that it had such a big impact on me. After all, the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg film (starring Tom Cruise, no less!) heightened my expectations and certainly had me expecting to see some more high-quality, first-rate filmmaking similar to that of his last film before that, 'A.I. - Artificial Intelligence', another favourite of mine. Naturally, of course, I got a whole lot more than I bargained for with this rich, sophisticated thriller.First off, I'd like to congratulate all who were involved - particularly the special effects/production design teams who did a fantastic job of creating the convincing picture of our world around 50 years from now. I would also like to praise Spielberg for once again using whom I think is a wonderful cinematographer. That man is Janusz Kaminski. I LOVE the grainy, smudgy, washed-out look he brought to this film, with its gloomy dark-blue tints and cold, cruel feel. I think he brings terrific style to Spielberg's current films (this, 'A.I.', and 'Catch Me If You Can') and I hope he continues to contribute to future projects in this manner.In a summer that, for me, was full of cinematic disappointments, 'Minority Report' managed to (not surprisingly) rise above the turmoil and stand on its own as a real triumph. Solid in virtually every aspect from acting to writing to music. A beautiful and refreshingly intelligent portrait of society that's full of heavy, challenging issues/themes to wrap one's head around. A perfect work in my eyes.",Null,0,1,29 August 2003
Memento," Addictive and fun to figure out
","Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is truly a rare and exceptional achievement in modern filmmaking in that it manages to be new, fresh, hip, and exciting without ever tiring its audience out - unless you're walking into this film without the desire to participate and actively analyze the mysterious details.If that's the case, then this is DEFINITELY not a movie you should see. If, on the other hand, you are open-minded, creative, and alert, you'll definitely appreciate and get a kick out of this one. 'Memento' is an old-fashioned 'film noir'-type mystery thriller with an intriguing, ingenious twist: outfitting the entire film with a style that mirrors the protagonist's own mental condition while giving the poor viewer(s) his own perspective as well. It is masterfully filmed and edited in such a way that it is chronologically presented backwards (with two initially separate, parallel storylines - the main one, shot in colour, is the chronologically-backwards story with scenes that intercut with those of the other story, which is filmed more like a documentary, shot in black & white, and mostly takes place inside a motel room with the main character narrating, talking about the effects of his condition, etc.) While the average viewer may already be put off by such a complicated, confusing format, it is a very original premise that is well worth the struggle to figure out.Acting is solid across the board, as is the writing, directing, etc., but special kudos must be extended to the very talented editor Dody Dorn, who successfully managed to put all of these fragments together and help them flow in a smooth, healthy manner that is not easy to pull off.One of the most 'memorable' (sorry, couldn't help slipping in the bad joke) films you're likely to ever see, 'Memento' is an instant classic due to its groundbreaking narrative style and impressive dramatic undertones. For those jaded moviegoers who seek something to keep them awake, interested, and constantly thinking, there couldn't be a better choice than this film.",Null,422,480,1 September 2003
The English Patient," Wow!
","I JUST finished watching this film about an hour ago, and - not surprisingly - a lot of the images, music, and performances still remain etched in my brain...It will probably end up that way for a long time, as this film actually holds a rather special significance for me: in my experience this was the first motion picture that familiarized me with and got me interested in watching the annual Academy Awards telecast! I can vividly remember all the near-unanimous critical praise this epic masterpiece had been receiving back in 1996, for everything from its direction to its screenplay to its passionate exchanges; I also remember the truckload of Oscars that was bestowed upon it the following year as well. Viewing the film now, for the first time, it is quite simple to see why this film managed to appeal to the critical masses. 'The English Patient' truly is one of those films that has 'everything' (i.e. action, adventure, romance, etc.) in my opinion. It is an impressively told, and superbly adapted film version of the Michael Ondaatje novel (which, incidentally, I had just finished reading a few weeks prior). Obviously it is not a totally flawless work when it comes to interpreting the order of some scenes (although it comes pretty darn close at times) - yet I still have a phenomenal amount of respect and admiration for all the cast and crew involved to translate this seemingly difficult-to-translate novel into a movie. Believe me. Those like me who have read the novel will probably agree that it couldn't be easy to film something like this - much less film it WELL.If there's anything however that's really worthy of singling out to congratulate endlessly, for me it would have to be the unbelievably brilliant casting. Whoever put such a rich and talented group of actors together (all of whom were pitch-perfect for the roles) should be given a lot of credit, because these people pulled it off to shocking perfection! For me they were all very well reflective of the general way I imagined the characters in the novel (although you could say that I knew a lot about the film and its actors far before I even read the novel, but that's besides the point). They were engaging, they were beautiful, they were radiant...the ideal cast for such an old-fashioned, uplifting award-sweeping romance as this one. I loved it!'The English Patient' is a dazzling, fine work of art that more than deserved its staggering number of Oscar wins (including the Best Picture of 1996!), and I highly recommend it. A truly well-crafted film.",Null,1,3,12 September 2003
"South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut"," A masterwork of obscene satire and musical animation
","First of all, let me just get something out of the way here, and set it absolutely straight before I begin: Ever since mid-August of 1997 (and probably until around early 2000), I was an unnervingly obsessed fan of the phenomenal TV milestone that was Comedy Central's animated series, 'South Park'. As it premiered in that actual month (August '97), you could say I was with that show from virtually the beginning. Since I had never seen anything like it before, what with its weird construction-paper-cutout animation and unconventional dark humour, I felt I had found the perfect new cartoon to help cope with the fallout from my equally short-lived 'Beavis & Butt-head' phase just a few months prior.Fast-forward to around December of 1998 - the time I became aware of a fact that, at the time, seemed FAR too good to be true: There was going to be a 'South Park' MOVIE!!! You have no idea how wonderful this was to me...and after I downloaded the few teaser trailers (the ones that solemnly started off with scenes of high-tech computer animation before shifting to Cartman's likeness), the taste of anticipation was rising furiously. I can say with 100% assurance that I have never, EVER, at any moment in my life before (or since) anticipated a movie more than I was anticipating 'South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut'. It seemed appropriate enough that the film would be released in the summer of 1999 - the exact period when my obsession with 'South Park' was at its highest peak! Of course, nothing could ever top that historical moment (at least from my experience) of walking into the theatre with my dad on opening night (naturally!) and finally watching those lights dim to prepare us for a sick, twisted, epic journey unlike anything we would ever see!At first, like most other hardcore fans, I was shocked initially when news broke that the 'South Park' movie was going to be done in the style of - 'gasp' - a MUSICAL! As a matter of fact, for a brief moment I was actually doubting the success of this ambitious project...It certainly had the potential to accentuate the show's sudden leap onto the big-screen format. Still, the question was: Would good ol' Trey and Matt pull it off? I wasn't really surprised when I immediately bought the soundtrack upon its release a while before the film's release; by the time I heard the first track's lilting opening Disney-esque score I had forgotten for a second that I was about to listen to something that could be considered about as ANTI-Disney as one can get! Nevertheless, one couldn't deny the impressive fervor with which the composers/orchestra lampooned such generic animated musical stylings. It obviously made me look forward to the film even more...and boy, did the wait ever pay off! I can't say I've had a more memorable, exciting, and just plain good ol' time at the movies! Even my dad (whom I don't think knew much about the show) was chuckling every so often, making me think he was rather enjoying the offensive chaos - although by its end, and our exit from the theatre, there was actually not a word that was exchanged between us until we got to the car. (I guess he didn't enjoy it as much as I thought) The fact of the matter was, however, that I had finally seen something I had considered to be a golden entry into the annals of film history! Even better was the unexpected critical acclaim that was being showered all over this film, praising it for its refreshingly shocking humour, razor-sharp wit, and merciless satire of everything from Canadians to Conan O'Brien! I was very pleased to see that others shared my strong opinion that this film was - in its own unique, special way - a true masterpiece. Filled with showstopping larger-than-life musical numbers, beautifully 'evolved' animation (by comparison to the show at the time - I was shocked, SHOCKED, to actually see the children's feet moving when they walked!!), and of course, a record-breaking number of profanities/offensive images, 'South Park: BLU' is one for the ages. Call my taste questionable if you must, but I am (and always will be) an unabashed admirer of such an outrageously fun show, that I never thought could ever follow up to such cinematic success (it didn't). 'South Park', as a show and ESPECIALLY as a movie adaptation, has done wonders with influencing my sense of humour, as well as some of my own views of the world and celebrity culture (whether that's for better or for worse is left open for interpretation). It's one of my favourite films of all time, and that will never change.VIVA 'LA RESISTANCE'!!!",Null,3,3,4 September 2003
Taxi Driver," Shockingly presented; without question one of the best films of the '70s
","'Taxi Driver' was my first Martin Scorsese film, and I applaud him as well as his cast and crew for putting together a triumphant, first-rate drama. The dreamy, garish way with which he films some of the bleakest New York City streets I've ever seen is unbelievable. Combine this with a phenomenal musical score and raw, convincing character studies and you've got one of the best films of this - or any - decade.Robert De Niro of course is fantastic as the disturbed, sympathetic character of Travis Bickle, a very lonely taxi driver for whom life is just a depressing, repetitive cycle; day-in, day-out...driving along the dangerous streets, haunted by its sick inhabitants, and driven ultimately to a terrifying physical/mental state that must be seen to be believed, Travis is easily one of the more memorable film characters I've witnessed in recent memory - realistic, vulnerable and heart-breaking. Watching him twist along through a winding path eventually leading to pure unabashed insanity brought a rare feeling of genuine concern, and disbelief. The people he meets and regularly socializes with every day, the awful conditions he's forced to put up with during the wee hours of the night...It just all seemed too perfect, the way this was put together, with its lingering images and lines, and unspeakable violence creating a shockingly convincing environment.A solid film all around - well-deserving of classic status.",Null,0,0,21 September 2003
The Godfather: Part II," An enjoyable, and grandly epic, sequel...one of the best
","Over the years, I have had an unusual history of often seeing important movie sequels before their predecessors. This is by no means intentional - merely bad timing. For a long time, this viewing pattern has occurred, oddly enough, with a few films that are considered among the greatest sequels ever made ('Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back', 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'). I can add a new title to that list: 'The Godfather - Part II'. Yes, I must confess, I STILL have not yet seen the original 1972 crime classic about the beloved mafia family - but I'm sure I'll get around to it someday soon. I've seen PARTS of it here and there, anyway...and this epic, Oscar-winning sequel didn't surprise me in making me think of it as most likely superior to the first one (and certainly FAR superior to the third one in 1990, which I heard was a bit of a clunker, unfortunately).In any case, this is truly one of the finest FILMS, not just sequels, I have ever seen, with a scope and power that very few other pictures can rival, quite frankly. I was blown away by much of the virtuoso performances from most of the actors - of course singling out Al Pacino and Robert De Niro as the most amazing ones, especially De Niro.A masterpiece of storytelling, beautifully directed and told. Unforgettable.",Null,0,1,28 September 2003
The Shining," My introduction to Stanley Kubrick
","I'll never forget this. Probably one of the most - if not THE most - terrifying classic horror films I've ever seen. (Plus, it was the very first movie I saw that was made by my soon-to-be favourite filmmaker of all time!). Like many people, I saw this film at a rather surprisingly young age. I was at a friend's sleepover (birthday?) party, and he - or someone in his family - had rented this movie called 'The Shining', starring Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall, and directed by some guy I had never heard of, but whom apparently was a great director, with a great style. After hearing the creepy premise, I looked forward to this interesting journey with quiet anticipation...Words couldn't express my silent whirlwind reaction to the style and scope of this man's work. From the very first frame of opening credits, I was hooked (and scared to death, naturally; and it was just a freakin' shot of a car driving!)So many images, lines, and scenes from this film still resonate with me that I won't even bother going on forever about each one...but I will say that throughout this disturbing, beautifully-conceived nightmare, I was constantly trying to figure out how I was going to sleep that night! That's some powerful material! I must admit, however unfortunately, that I've never read Stephen King's novel upon which I found out this was based. I found out much later that he apparently HATED this version, but I nevertheless respected his opinion. After all, this movie wouldn't have been made if it weren't for him!A rich, timeless, and unforgettable masterpiece of cinematic horror that is surely among the best work of Kubrick's illustrious career.",Null,1,2,21 August 2003
Apocalypse Now," Enthralling, but a bit too long...
","...That's probably because my first-ever viewing of 'Apocalypse Now' was in its 'Redux' version - featuring around 40 minutes of additional footage that, in the 3-hour-plus product, apparently formed the crux of what was ORIGINALLY envisioned.Oh, well. I buy it. Contrary to what most others thought, I didn't have a problem with the film's somewhat bloated running length - though I shouldn't really be able to judge, as I have never, ever seen the film before. Fans of the original tend to side with it, and dismiss THIS 2001 re-release as a cheap marketing gimmick (which most re-releases usually are). Nevertheless, I wasn't too bothered by its epic pace; this masterful Vietnam war picture had an impact that resonated with me all the more strongly BECAUSE of its longevity. The next week I ended up viewing the tighter, original 1979 version - and, while still obviously good, I found I somewhat preferred the newer version, for its fascinating additions that lent new depth and meaning to its images. This is a terrific, and shockingly realistic drama, showcasing unbelievable performances from an all-star cast backed by a legendary director. Obviously enough has been said about the infamous ordeal that countless cast and crew members went through to make it on location. The result was well worth it, and provides an insightful, thoroughly enjoyable window into the hellish, surreal world of the Vietnam war.",Null,2,3,5 December 2003
Being John Malkovich," Defies description
","I really didn't know what to say when those final credits abruptly started rolling amongst the confounding final images of the enigma that is 'Being John Malkovich'. How surreal can one single film be? The sheer amount of concepts, imagery, lines, structures...it's clearly a revolutionary picture, as far as I'm concerned. No doubt about that. Very rarely do I finish watching a picture with such a disturbed, bewildered reaction as I had when my viewing of this ended. Now, I've become newly re-interested in the phenomenal genius of the two major behind-the-scenes men who put this together: Spike Jonze, and Charlie Kaufman. How unbelievably wild, off-the-wall, and just plain 'OUT THERE' can two guys be?? These guys are absolute lunatics! I couldn't believe my eyes! Not to mention the terrific casting and the amazingly-crafted storyline (that I have yet to fully comprehend, not surprisingly) - and of course, a signature scene that, I feel, will remain as one of the few most spectacularly messed-up sequences in motion picture history I have ever seen! (That would be the 'Malkoviches in the restaurant' scene) Wow! What a memorable gem! Need I say more? Is there really anything else one can say about this? It's all been said before; I totally commend and give major, MAJOR props to all involved in such a great film that truly stands out as one of the most groundbreaking and innovative films of the 20th century's closing. Spike Jonze - also a world-renowned music video guru - is definitely a fascinating young talent to watch.",Null,0,1,3 October 2003
Gandhi," A true epic, in every sense of the word
","Very, VERY few films have had the distinct ability to move and inspire me to the point where the effect is almost life-altering. 'Gandhi' - the unbelievable, first-rate biopic on the historical figure - is truly one of those films, no question whatsoever. An unsurprising sweep for the 1983 Academy Awards, this is without a doubt one of the last real 'epic' motion pictures ever.Chronicling the rich, unforgettable life of a one Mohandas K. 'Mahatma' Gandhi - played to shocking perfection by the wonderful Sir Ben Kingsley - this is a film that I can say really, deeply affected me with its power, its scale, and of course, its timeless message of love and non-violence. As a matter of fact, ever since I first saw the film, and became much more aware of the back story, I can also say that Gandhi is now one of my biggest role models in life. I cannot fully express how much this great man's way of thinking - his words, his struggles, his accomplishments - has affected my own, for I am now a practicing pacifist. I am a firm believer in the value of non-violent protest, and have tried my best to apply that philosophy to most situations in my life. It has worked wonders for me, and has really changed how I view the world in terms of human nature and so forth. Like I said, VERY few films can do something like that to me.",Null,162,200,15 September 2003
Spirited Away," One of the finest animated films I've ever seen
","I was tremendously excited to finally be seeing what all the fuss was about when I rented the fantastical children's anim√É¬© 'Spirited Away'. This movie seemed to have virtually unanimous critical praise across the board, and moviegoers all over the globe have truly embraced this modern masterpiece - and for obviously good reason.Watching the incredible journey of 'Spirited Away', I was immediately taken in by its breathtaking layers of animation, endearing characters, and mind-boggling feats of creativity and imagination. Memorable spirits and creatures aside, the film is a colourful, richly-detailed epic with great storytelling. I loved it so much that I simply had to see it again with a family member, who ended up loving it as well. I guess no matter who you are or how old you are, there's something universal in 'Spirited Away' that can appeal to anyone, somehow.Excellent, innovative, touching, and often hilarious. 'Spirited Away' is one of the finest animated films I've ever seen.",Null,0,0,27 August 2003
The Pianist," Adrien Brody gives a top-notch, Oscar-worthy performance
","Throughout the entire length of 'The Pianist', I was incredibly moved and shocked speechless by some of the disturbingly graphic ghetto scenes, with Jews being tormented by the ever-present wicked Nazi soldiers. Of course, I've heard more than a few comments from other viewers who think this film is basically just a 'Schindler's List Lite', if you will. These people say it's just another effort in a long line of supposedly exploitative Holocaust dramas from the past decade or so.While I can clearly see their argument, I must add that, admittedly, I have not seen a great deal of those types of films (my best exposure to such WWII-era subject matter would have to indeed be the aforementioned 'Schindler's List', arguably Steven Spielberg's greatest film); nevertheless, I'm sure that if I HAD seen more of those films, I still would have been just as fazed after viewing this one. I don't know about you, but I haven't exactly become desensitized to such horrific imagery (like some others apparently have), and I still find those topics to be increasingly fascinating to watch in movie form. As well, the fact that this entire project was held together by the phenomenal lead performance from Adrien Brody didn't hurt, either. I thought his acting was completely deserving of the Best Actor Academy Award win, and Mr. Roman Polanski as well was more than worthy of being bestowed with the Best Director Academy Award. The stunningly realistic look of the film, coupled with winning performances and a beautiful musical score, makes for a heart-wrenching, unforgettable true story. Highly recommended - although again, if you find yourself easily disturbed by the violent nature, perhaps you can avoid this one. It is pretty grim, as one would probably expect.Aside from that, though, this is a masterpiece. Well-done.",Null,0,1,31 August 2003
Moulin Rouge!," 'The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love, and to be loved in return...'
","And so I went, journeying into the unforgettable trip that was 'Moulin Rouge!' - now and forever one of my all-time favourite MOVIES (not just movie musicals) ever! I simply cannot say enough to express how very deeply this film affected me when I first viewed it...it's impossible. From the very first jaw-dropping image of the 20th-Century Fox logo bordered by a beautiful red velvet curtain and a bouncy conductor - I knew then that I was about to experience something I had never seen before. Grand, inspiring, original, flawless...everything that so many others have said in their descriptions of 'Moulin Rouge!' could not be put any better. This is the reason I am now a bona-fide fan of director Baz Luhrmann. I had actually seen some of his previous work - the hyperkinetic modern version of William Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet' - and from then on was absolutely hooked onto his visual flair. Likewise with 'R+J', 'Moulin Rouge!' oozes with theatrical energy, gorgeous costumes/set designs, terrific music, and of course, first-rate acting from its wonderful two leads, as well as the supporting cast.Watching the first few minutes, I could unfortunately see why this movie was ignored and laughed at by many critics, filmgoers, etc.; apparently it developed a bit of a 'cult' following of sorts after that. I agree that it's not for everybody - but come on, after I finished it, I remember thinking: 'What's wrong with everybody? This movie is a classic! What were the haters thinking?' Granted, if you don't like musicals, I can understand, but for others, I guess its overwhelming originality and unconventional wisdoms were too much for some people. Oh, well...you clearly can't please everybody.
At any rate, this film deserved all the praise and award nominations it received and/or won. It's certainly one of the more interesting and groundbreaking films released early in the new millennium, and it truly reminds some of us just why we love movies in the first place (or musicals, or MOVIE musicals, for that matter). It lifts our spirits with often-campy fun. It's lovely, it's larger-than-life, and it's just plain phenomenal. A joy to watch and listen to.I'll stop gushing for now...I think I've made my point clear. Thank you.* * * TRUTH * BEAUTY * FREEDOM * LOVE * * *",Null,12,21,27 August 2003
Pi," Genius!
","I have yet to come even close to fully appreciating the sheer artistry and complexity of Darren Aronofsky's stunning mathematical/sci-fi thriller, 'Pi'. Watching this film, one can tell from the subdued effects, grainy black-and-white filter, and guerrilla-style filmmaking that this must be a low-budget independent film - NOT to try and downplay its impact, as many independent films can clearly surpass any typical Hollywood movie, in terms of style and subject matter.'Pi' is a perfectly concrete example of how the relative absence of special effects, explosions, etc. can still help create an engaging, and thoroughly unique viewing experience. Overflowing with intensity and hyperkinetic camerawork, this is a frightening roller-coaster ride of a film; despite clocking in at less than 90 minutes, 'Pi' is by no means short on resonance - but rather leaves a heavy feeling of exuberance and fascination with the material that lasts long after it's finished. At the same time, though, people who aren't as open-minded to more obscure, abstract films like this would be, I think, surprised. This is not as complicated or bewildering a film as I had expected. If one can be able to focus intently on the story, the result is rewarding, and doesn't provide for much head-scratching. Its style seems rather modern, rather hip...at times it reminded me of 'The Matrix' (which, ironically, was released the FOLLOWING year) what with its slick techno musical score and its flashy opening credits.To shy away from this film simply because of its math content is to be completely shallow and ignorant. The way it handles the material is a whole lot more interesting than you'd probably think. Like 'A Beautiful Mind', 'Pi' is an instant classic that serves to re-awaken my erratic interests in my poorest subject, mathematics. It's original, it's interesting, and above all - genius.",Null,96,145,5 October 2003
Mulholland Drive," A terrifying, exciting ride
","With this being my first David Lynch film, I'm pretty certain that I've BARELY even begun to scratch the surface in terms of how far his other films can go in terms of surreal, haunting atmosphere. I had heard a lot about this controversial director, of course, and was looking forward to watching this very much after reading about it...and by the time it reached the end credits, I can safely say this was without a doubt the most @#$%ed-up (I mean that in the most affectionate way possible) film I have ever feasted my eyes upon!In addition to having a well-crafted and mind-numbingly complex storyline (which I actually managed to follow with some degree of success), 'Mulholland Dr.' is also full of some of the most incredible cinematography and direction I've ever seen. Furthermore, I couldn't be more impressed by the stellar performances from all cast members, especially Naomi Watts and Laura Elena Harring as the two deeply mysterious leads. This is certainly a unique, disturbing piece of work that is sure to remain burned into my psyche for a long, long time. I can't fully express my zombie-like state of horror by film's end, when the slew of images that occurred in those last several minutes haunted me silly. I was very much afraid to do anything at that time. I suppose that's when you know you've made some powerfully effective material.Kudos to Mr. Lynch...you're a fascinating director whom I will be watching for some time now.",Null,2,4,30 August 2003
8 Mile," A well-made, immensely enjoyable 'semi-biopic'
","For all the hype that was first surrounding this film, it delivered shockingly well considering the expectations. I must admit, I was very surprised by how much I was rooting for the underdog protagonist by the end of Eminem's great drama '8 Mile'. Backed by an impressive all-star cast, an amazing director, and of course, the raw, intense material that is freestyle rap, this 'rags-to-riches' story is always a compelling watch. Unlike some other recent ill-fated leaps to the big screen by musicians, this film can certainly stand out as one of the few crowned jewels of 2002. It is a terrifically entertaining, and powerful, picture. I don't know if I would quite call it a masterpiece, nor would I go so far as to praise Eminem's acting as Oscar-worthy (which some people obviously did). He's a fine actor, I agree, but when one is essentially playing a sketchy version of him/herself, I don't know if that would exactly qualify for the coveted statuette.Nevertheless, the film is a moving tale of struggle, hardship, and pain, and how much success in the world of music can mean to one person. Jimmy Smith 'Bunny Rabbit' Jr. (Eminem) is truly a sympathetic character whom, despite some of his clear flaws, is the kind of person most people would want to see make it in the real world, due to his sincere dedication and his personal turmoil.'8 Mile' is without a doubt one of the best musician-to-actor-transition films I have ever seen. Although it can be more than a little mainstream and clich√©d at times, I disagree with the people who claim this film is far too tame. No way. This is about as real as it gets in the underground. It's a keeper.",Null,0,0,5 October 2003
2001: A Space Odyssey," In short - perfection
","What can I really say about a film like '2001' that hasn't been repeated over and over to death?...Honestly, it doesn't take a rocket scientist (pardon the clich√É¬© - HA! Something repeated over and over to death!) to understand the fact: You can argue all you want until kingdom come, but any non-fan of Kubrick out there that loves to voice his/her pronounced dislike or hatred for his body of work is in a rather small minority. I feel a large degree of sympathy for anyone so focused on trying to tear apart a classic - a film with near-universal appeal and unanimous acclaim - with weak, tired claims that it is 'long', 'boring', 'dated', 'soulless'...First of all, a film with this kind of subject matter shouldn't be expected to be a short, hamhanded, special-effects-riddled 'blockbuster' that panders to countless increasingly impatient audiences. It was never meant to be like that. Nevertheless, even when it was made and released in the late '60s - a time when, I assume, audiences had far longer attention spans - it was STILL met initially with a lot of critical uproar. People were probably walking out almost an hour before it finished; people were probably sleeping, complaining, what have you...basically, the same reaction I expect it would receive from a mainstream audience today. Yet somehow, over a long period of time, this film was finally given its long-overdue props, and genuinely recognized as one of the most important and timeless cinematic masterpieces of all time.Is it just me - or am I being a little more long-winded and wordy than usual? Oh, well...I can get that way when reflecting on something like this. I'm very passionate about Stanley Kubrick and his work; he is without a doubt one of the true legends of filmmaking, who has also suffered from some of the most unfortunate labellings and criticisms from the media regarding his eccentricity and whatnot. Okay - so what? He can be a little off-his-rocker sometimes. I can admit to seeing that, diehard admirer that I am. I understand all the gossip and the stories that - quite frankly - were a good part of the reason I became interested in him in the first place. So you could call me a hypocrite. Maybe I am...but hey, his films and his legacy will always be of interest to me, and of course in the long run, the private nature of the artist himself isn't all that relevant, is it?
You see...I believe that Stanley Kubrick is a visual genius, no question. His trademark slow, cold, ominous shooting style is frequently a joy to behold. If someone considers his films too boring or too high-brow or whatever - then at the risk of sounding too obnoxious, you shouldn't be watching his films. Instead, you should stop right now and just leave them alone, and go see something else that may keep you awake and attentive for more than 10 seconds! I don't care what anyone says...overlong and pretentious it may be at points (I remember almost being driven to insanity the first time I saw it), but on the whole it is an absolute monument! It is an historic and landmark achievement in film and it deserves every bit of speculation, positive or negative, that comes its way. It's no big puzzle when you see that this is apparently among most international critics' Top 10 lists of the greatest motion pictures of all time! Again...you can argue that it's merely opinion, but really, as a moderate film buff, whose opinion would I trust more: that of a veteran, knowledgable movie critic, or some stubborn, close-minded, inexperienced viewer who refuses to give a hint of consideration for the opposing views? Maybe I'm starting to sound a little overly pompous at this point, and I sincerely apologize if my comments are giving off that vibe. It's just that I recently came across a rant-like statement from some no-name curmudgeon denouncing Kubrick as being a 'fraud' in the history of filmmaking. I'm sure you can imagine how quietly outraged I was by such a statement - especially since the arguments backing it up were rather vague, and malicious.At any rate, I think I've made my point clear. Nothing more needs to be said; I've said all I've needed to say. '2001' is classy, high-art filmmaking at its very finest. Period.",Null,1,4,25 September 2003
Eyes Wide Shut," The perfect end to a perfect filmmaker's career
","I don't care what anyone else says. Sure, most of them say that Steven Spielberg is the greatest, most successful director of all time (which is true to a certain extent), I will always consider Stanley Kubrick to be the quintessential image of that; he is my all-time favourite filmmaker, with a style and interpretation that resonated with me from the first few seconds I saw of 'The Shining' (1980), my first-ever Kubrick viewing. He is a director of unequaled talent, persistence, and vision, whose fascinating persona has been notoriously publicized in tabloid news around the globe for decades. He's been labelled 'reclusive', 'eccentric', a 'tyrant', a 'perfectionist', etc. ...Call him what you will, but you cannot deny the illustrious career he's made out of creating some of the most significant motion pictures ever.That career was tragically shattered upon his death in March of 1999 - just a few months before the release of his now-final film: 'Eyes Wide Shut', a gloomy, subdued, but hypnotic study of the human condition.Like all the rest of Kubrick's films, 'Eyes Wide Shut' of course boasts a stunning visual style that ends up making every frame look almost like a work of art. The soft, colourful palettes used throughout the film give an eerie, surreal, almost dreamy look to it. It matches the wildly dysfunctional mood of most scenes, and really lends some first-class cinematography to the proceedings.When 'Eyes Wide Shut' was released in the summer of 1999, I, unfortunately, was not able to see it. Of course, at the time, I still wasn't fully aware of just how unparalleled a genius Mr. Kubrick was, and I had yet to be fully appreciative of his unique body of work. A few years down the line...I finally caught an uncut television broadcast of the nearly three-hour film (since it was on TV it was over three hours, but that's besides the point). The reactions, emotions, and feelings simmering through me as I journeyed through this bizarre masterpiece cannot be fully expressed in words; I was captivated every minute, watching the horrific and sad tribulations faced by the film's lead couple - then-married 'mega-stars' Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. I must say, for all the flak this film received about the acting when it was released, I was actually surprised at how ABOVE-average and well-done the performances were (as well as supporting roles). It clearly couldn't be easy for a real-life married celebrity couple (much less a non-couple) to pull it off with such uncomfortable, heavy subject matter. Forcing these two leads to question their own lives, the film does a remarkable job of presenting the psychological twists and turns of each spouse's state - and, of course, the famous, digitally-altered orgy cult sequence didn't fail to give me some nightmares with that chillingly simplistic piano score.There is also a number of other memorable and haunting moments to be had, obviously...and the equally talked-about ending historically concludes with the perfect one-word statement before cutting to black and having the last Kubrick credits roll.For all the legendary 'porno movie' hype surrounding the more low-key end result, 'Eyes Wide Shut' was apparently a gigantic disappointment to many critics and fans...but in the end, it proved that after an often-turbulent film career, one could still come out on top before abruptly leaving this world.The perfect end to a perfect filmmaker's career. Stanley Kubrick, you will forever be missed.",Null,5,7,6 September 2003
Mystic River," Profoundly moving
","The great Clint Eastwood's powerful character study 'Mystic River' is a stirring and beautifully crafted tale of three male childhood friends. Many years later, as full-grown adults, their lives suddenly turn back to intertwine following the mysterious murder of the 19-year-old daughter of one of the men.Not only was I impressed by the stellar cast assembled for this film, but I was deeply moved and saddened by the unfortunate twists and turns many people's lives took in this raw, unflinching crime drama. It's a serious, masterfully told piece of work, and everything from acting to direction to music is (not surprisingly) solid across the board...even though at times, admittedly, the film's somewhat dreary, schmaltzy tone could get a little manipulative; thankfully, such is a very, VERY minor complaint in a sea of praise for this amazing piece. One can't stop raving about the performances themselves - particularly from the spectacular trio of male leads: Sean Penn, Tim Robbins and Kevin Bacon. Absolutely astonishing and Oscar-worthy - every single one of them, and then some (supporting players, etc.) Granted, it took me a little while to get used to their sometimes grating Boston accents, but in time their convincing personalities and dilemmas grew on me heavily.In a time where, to be brutally honest, the amount of genuinely good films is dwindling to a respectable few, 'Mystic River' is a very welcome surprise for me. Taut, suspenseful, and emotional, it's a wonderful start to the much-anticipated fall season of potential award-winning films.",Null,0,0,25 October 2003
