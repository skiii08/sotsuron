The Perks of Being a Wallflower," Rather bland, albeit somewhat original take on a known story
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a coming of age story where introverted, shy, 15-year-old Charlie (Logan Lerman) enters high-school, and meets some new friends.Truthfully, there's a whole bunch of movies like this out already, and this one doesn't seem to be adding that much originality to the table. All the standard high-school-based movie scenes come by: Boy is bullied, boy meets friends, boy meets girl, boy goes to high-school dance, boy tries drugs, boy has first kiss, boy has relationship trouble, boy has serious mental issues. Oh OK, so the last one is sort of different.Without spoiling any of the plot, Charlie has some psychological difficulties, and we learn about their origins in flashbacks (how original). The whole set-up is rather bland. Truthfully, the entire plot is rather bland. There seems to be almost no character development within the story at all. Aside from Charlie none of the other characters change in any significant way from the initial impressions we get of them at the start of the movie. And yes, Charlie finds some friends, and perhaps becomes less of a recluse, but he reverts back to his old self by the end of the movie, making the entire ordeal feel somewhat aimless.There is no purpose to the plot. There is a beginning, a middle, and an end, but nothing truly noteworthy happens anywhere within that time. This is just a story of a kid, and his first year of high- school. Thing is, we all know this story, because we have all been there ourselves.Admittedly, there are definite strong points within the plot. Some earnestly serious issues are touched upon, such as suicide, abuse, homophobia, bullying, and the aforementioned mental health problems. But it is all just thrown together to produce an angsty stew of – perhaps slightly above averagely – damaged teens and their shenanigans.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is set in the '90s, and this is established very nicely with the correct technology, attire and especially musical references, including whole scenes dedicated to the Rocky Horror Picture Show. Now, Rocky Horror was a bit before my time (thankfully?), but I'm glad to know it was already a somewhat nerdy thing to like back in the early '90s.In the end, walking out of the cinema, all I was left with were lingering feelings of melancholy and confusion. Melancholy, as I was thinking about the main characters' damaged pasts; and confusion about why this rather bland story was ever made into a movie in the first place.All reviews are inherently subjective, but given the widely varying reviews of this movie, I suspect you probably have to see for yourself whether this is a movie you'll enjoy. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",5,1,6,21 January 2013
The Impossible," Although certainly not perfect, it's a movie worth watching.
","Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com - Last night I went to the advanced screening of The Impossible starring Naomi Watts and Ewan McGregor.First of all, if you're planning to go see this movie and haven't seen the trailer, be sure not to see it. I think it's a perfect example of a trailer that reveals too much of the movie. There is even a part that has to come as a surprise, but when you've seen the trailer (or even some of the movie posters) it isn't, and you were just waiting for it.The movie is about a happy family who spent their Christmas Holiday at the shores of Thailand in 2004. Indeed, the year the tsunami hit The movie starts with an eerie sound, a sound that sets the feeling for this movie perfectly. The first fifteen minutes the movie is building up to what we all know will happen, the tsunami. The moment where this happens is a great scene. The filmmakers did this very well, by using one powerful thing: Sound. By not using a song or sad melody but just using the sound of the powerful, powerful water it is as if you are there! We all know how everything sounds when your head is under water, multiply it by 100, add some debris, a lot of panic and a rush of water and it feels immense. The sheer noise of roaring water. If you are going to see this movie, be sure to have an adequate sound system.After the severity of the tsunami itself subsides, begins the silence, the loneliness, the search. I think they showed this very well and you feel the brutal reality of it.About an hour into the movie things start to go downhill. At some point I got annoyed by the plot becoming too forced and the cheesy American-movie-things happen. The near-misses, the doubtful choices of the characters and the illogical things. They (try to) make the movie more dramatic than it needs to be. This is unnecessary because the whole tsunami-thing and aftermath IS dramatic enough. Sure, maybe only because it happened for real, but if it didn't happen for real there probably wasn't a movie like this.The main characters are the family, where especially the kids are great in the movie. Aside from the fact that they are cute they're also good actors and it's the children who manage getting you watery eyed now and then.Funny detail; at a given moment there are people of different nationalities who say something. Among them there is a Dutch woman, and surprisingly (contrary to what often happens) I could understand what she said in Dutch. I think it's great that they cast a Dutch person even for one sentence in the movie. I don't know how it is with the other nationalities (my Swedish isn't great ;-) ), but it was a welcome surprise.It wasn't a great movie, but there are plenty of moments the theatre was dead silent and no one dared to make any noise, not a single bag of crisps was crackling and even breathing stopped for a moment. Especially in the first hour you are drawn into the movie and the fact it is (based on) a real story adds to its power. The second half of the movie wasn't the greatest, but nonetheless I think it's a movie worth watching. - Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com",7,0,1,24 January 2013
Argo," Fast-paced, intelligent, and downright thrilling.
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - In the winter of 1979 Iranian revolutionaries storm and capture the US embassy in Tehran. 52 American diplomats are taken hostage within the embassy. Six Americans manage to evade capture and make it to the Canadian embassy, where they lay low. After 10 weeks the CIA is ordered to help with the exfiltration of these fugitives.This is the set-up for Argo, the new thriller directed by – and starring – Ben Affleck. Based on the actual events of the Iran Hostage Crisis, Argo grabs hold of you immediately, and has you sitting at the edge of your seat for the entire length of the film.The movie starts with a very succinct and clear recap of the events leading up to the Iranian revolution, for those not up to speed with the goings on of Iran in the '70s. Argo then immediately drops you into the action, with the gripping first ten minutes dedicated to establishing the severity and urgency of the situation by showing the brutal takeover of the US embassy in Tehran, and subsequent hostage situation. This sense of urgency remains palpable throughout the film until it finally discharges in the nail-biting final 30 minutes.I must admit I was never a fan of Ben Affleck's acting. But his acting in this feature film is stellar. Aside from Ben Affleck you can also enjoy the wonderful work of John Goodman, Kyle Chandler, Alan Arkin, and the always amazing Victor Garber and Bryan Cranston.Another aspect I really enjoyed was the fact that it is a period movie; Most of it takes place in early 1980 and Affleck makes sure you never forget that. From the clothes to the hair to the magnificent moustaches, everything screams '80s. Real news broadcast footage covering the crisis at the time is repeatedly shown on television sets throughout the film. Moreover the movie itself seems to be shot on film, rather than digitally. The added grain is a subtle way to keep you in the right era. Even the title-card for the Warner Bros. company is the '70s-era logo. All of this combines to add to the overall style and feel.All in all I really enjoyed this movie. It's fast-paced, intelligent, and downright thrilling. I highly recommend you watch it. However, it is quite a wordy movie. Aside from the action sequences in the beginning and end of the movie, the majority of the film is setting up the thrilling pay-off at the finale. Although I can definitely appreciate this, not everyone is so inclined. This also makes it less of an addition to see the movie in the cinema, as opposed to your own living room. Therefore I suggest you put Argo on your list of movies to watch when the Blu-Ray is released (March 2013). - review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",8,0,0,21 January 2013
Life of Pi," A wonderful visual feast with an excellent, somewhat thought-provoking story
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - Life of Pi is an intriguing movie. One of wondrous and unbelievable stories, with equally wondrous and unbelievable visuals.Life of Pi introduces us to Pi Patel, a Christian-Hindi-Muslim Indian man with an amazing story to tell. Pi was the son of a zoo keeper and when his family decides to move to Canada, he finds himself on a freighter ship with a whole host of wild animals. During a horrible storm the freighter sinks, and Pi ends up adrift in a lifeboat in the company of a zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger. This is a story of survival, of finding strength, of discovering oneself, and of having faith.Obviously such a fantastical and magical story must be told with similarly fantastical visuals. Life of Pi certainly succeeds in that regard, with truly breathtaking images throughout the movie. The dreamlike sequences in the lifeboat are beautifully rendered, as are the remaining scenes that play out in both India and Canada. Although it is sometimes visible that most of what is on the screen is computer generated (especially the animals and the water (and its reflections)) this in no way distracts from the film. Due to the fantastical atmosphere of the story the somewhat 'fake' or 'too perfect' CGI fits right in.The movie is shown in Real3D. I'm am not a fan of 3D. My brain does not enjoy the technique. I usually end up with a headache, and extremely strained eyes. But aside from this, I feel like the added blurriness of the images and the dimmer light of the screen is an unfair tradeoff for such a gimmicky addition to the medium.I have to hand it to Life of Pi though, it is one of the least crappy incorporations of 3D that I have seen. Again here the 3D is used to add to the sense of wonder and magic that transpires within the movie. With the exception of one 'flying fish'-scene, there is no blatant over-use of the 3D gimmick.I was surprised by the deeper messages within Life of Pi, something that was not at all conveyed in the trailers for the movie. Without spoiling anything, I like how themes such as personal strength, and especially religion were given plenty of screen-time. Mostly in the first quarter of the film, religion plays a large role in the story. I really liked what was said, but the message seems somewhat forgotten throughout the last part of the script. I can imagine how this is better meshed in the book, on which the movie is based.Something what somewhat put me off of the movie at first, judging only by the trailers, was the blatant unrealistic nature of the story. A boy and a bunch of wild animals, some of which carnivorous, surviving together in a tiny dingy? Ridiculous! Some friends and family-members convinced me to go see the movie despite of these doubts, and I am so happy they did. First of all, the whole script wasn't as unrealistic as the trailer made it out to be. There are some developments that add to the sense that; 'Perhaps this could've happened.' But moreover, in the end the question of whether the story is unrealistic or not is wonderfully ambiguously called upon within the movie through a final twist. I won't spoil it for you, but just urge you to not let the unrealism deter you from seeing this movie. To conclude, Life of Pi is a wonderful visual feast with an excellent, somewhat thought-provoking story. This combination creates such a great movie, that even the addition of 3D can't ruin a good product. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",8,0,2,21 January 2013
Django Unchained," Django Unchained is an excellent flick. The acting, directing, the action and production value are all stellar. Certainly a movie to be experienced on the big screen.
","Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com - Django Unchained is Quentin Tarantino's latest epic, a western (or rather 'Southern') genre action movie revolving around the titular Django, a freed slave played by Jamie Foxx. With the help of a German bounty hunter, Django becomes an experienced bounty hunter himself, with the eventual goal of rescuing his wife from a Mississippi plantation.This is an amazing piece of cinema. Nothing less than expected from Tarantino, who has proved he is a master in this field time and time again. Django Unchained starts off as western as it can be, with old-school type starting credits and the original Django-soundtrack of the 1960's inspiration. Fast zooms and extreme close-ups are used throughout the movie to keep that style of the western present throughout, but Tarantino wouldn't be Tarantino if he didn't inject his own style into the mix.There is some great action here, all brutal and gruesome. Although not as over-the-top as can be seen in some of Tarantino's earlier works, the blood does flow rather freely. The story does not depend on the action however, but rather revolves around the great characters. There is some incredible writing here, with good and proper flawed characters, and amazing actors to portray them. Jamie Foxx, Christoph Waltz, and especially Leonardo DiCaprio depict their respective roles splendidly. They get plenty of time to do so too, with over 2,5 hours the movie is a longer than standard film. It never felt like a long sit or boring to me, but I did feel like the story had somewhat of a problem with pacing at times. The character of Django transforms throughout the story, and this had to be shown with some key moments in time, but I felt like this could have been done cleaner and more efficiently. A minor point of critique in an otherwise great script however.There is a heap of hilarity in the movie as well, which I am sure some misguided people will take as an insult to the serious nature of the slavery issues shown in the movie. Even though there is plenty of laughs to be had, I feel certain none of them could be considered racist, although it is obviously not my prerogative to judge on this. The theme of slavery is a serious one, but if anything the cruel and brutal way in which it is portrayed in this film only underlines this fact, rather than make light of it.Django Unchained is an excellent flick, on a multitude of dimensions. The acting, directing, the action and production value are all stellar. This is certainly a movie to be experienced on the big screen. - Review posted originally on InspirationRation.com",9,0,1,24 January 2013
Jack Reacher," Amazing action and direction, with great acting. Less than stellar writing...
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - Jack Reacher is based on one in a series of books by Lee Child, featuring the titular character Jack Reacher. Jack is a former U.S. Army Military Police Major who is enjoying early retirement in near paranoid solitude. When a sniper expertly shoots and kills five innocent people in Pittsburgh, the police are quick to apprehend a suspect. The man claims to be innocent however, and asks for Jack Reacher. Meanwhile Jack has seen the situation develop on the news, and travels to Pittsburgh to find out for himself what exactly has transpired. Although initially convinced that the suspect is in fact the killer, his investigation leads to more questions than answers The action in this movie is stellar. Immediately from the first scene – where we see the sniper's actions through his scope – it becomes apparent that 'Jack Reacher' takes its time. The over the top action so prevalent in today's movies is traded in for more realistic, cold and calculated brutality. The feeling of sheer tension when seeing the sniper choose its random victims through his scope, not knowing when he is going to pull the trigger, is quickly built, and unrelenting for a majority of the film.This honest brutality is predominant throughout almost all the action. There is for instance, a truly great car chase scene reminiscent of Bullitt, where you are hurled into the dynamic thrashing of cars. No soundtrack, just the ruthless revving of engines, screeching of tires, and honking of oncoming traffic. Amazing mobile crane shots combined with long cuts show the action in all its glory and clarity. You won't find any cluttered and confusing fast-cuts which are so widespread in today's action movies, which give you a sense of action without showing you anything tangible at all. In this sense 'Jack Reacher' is a true breath of fresh air.There is some good humour here as well, with some funny, sometimes surprising scenes scattered throughout the film.The movie does have some serious shortcoming however. What it has going for it in terms of action and cinematography, it severely lacks in the writing department. Dialogue is often terrible, with one particular exposition-conversation being downright cringeworthy in its horridness. Awful lines like: 'I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot.' and similar are strewn throughout the film.The story itself also has some questionable plot-points. Some 'reveals' are so incredibly evident from the start that I feel like the writers severely underestimate the intelligence of the audience, and simultaneously downgrade the believability of the movie's characters. Additionally it seems the writers could not contain themselves and had to write in the clichéd 'final boss' man-to-man unarmed combat, including the obligatory 'bad guy has a hidden switchblade'-scene and the mandatory heavy rain. This unfortunately somewhat detracts from the otherwise previously mentioned uncharacteristically amazing and realistic action.I may be somewhat critical of the movie's shortcomings here, but please make no mistake, this is a great film! If you go to the theatre expecting a mediocre action-flick (as I was) you will be pleasantly surprised by its amazing action and more than decent acting. Just don't expect an enthralling thriller with amazing twists and great dialogue as well. For what 'Jack Reacher' is and is trying to be, it is certainly an excellent sample. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",8,2,7,21 January 2013
Les Misérables," Les Misérables is quite the show, grand in design and performances. Long runtime and excessive singing certainly do make it a formidable watch, not for everyone's taste.
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - Les Misérables is the classic story of Jean Valjean, a man who is hunted for many years by the ruthless officer Javert, after breaking parole in 19th-century France. He promises dying factory-worker Fantine to take care of her daughter Cosette. It is a story about belief, honour, debts, love, and revolution.There is an amazing cast assembled here, and the talent is splattered across the screen. There's incredible acting, and astounding singing (some people get all the talents). Especially Russell Crowe as Javert and Anne Hathaway as Fantine stood out to me as being exceptionally great. Their characters go through some intense emotional hardship and this is performed remarkably.Les Mis' production design and -value is also exceptional. Both the grandeur and squalor of 19th century France is showcased remarkably well in huge sets with incredible detail. Not to mention the huge amount of actors, in especially the revolutionary scenes, really sell the experience.As this is a musical I can't ignore talking about the music and lyrics. I have never seen any other adaptation of Les Mis, and went in to the movie with absolutely no expectations or preconceptions. I was pleasantly surprised with the beautiful story, which is transferred really well by the music and lyrics. However, it is quite a sit-through. The movie runs over 2,5 hours, and with the exception of a few lines of dialogue, everything is sung. Lines such as 'Where are you?' and 'Help, I am stuck under this cart!' are all sung. This does wear on you in times, and perhaps elongates the runtime more than was necessary. On the other hand, it's a musical, what do you expect? I hate to be too critical here, as I did like the overall movie-experience, but the cinematography was abysmal at times. There are certain choices that the director made that are unfathomable to me. Among others, there is a severe overuse of hand-held camera-techniques. This humanizes the audience, and lowers them to the level of the characters, placing the audience within their midst (as opposed to the 'eye of god'). I can understand this in and of itself, but combined with some of the other techniques creates a feeling quite separate from the intention of the story in the movie. Deliberate off-kilter framing and dutch-angles are used multiple times. These are used to create a sense of uneasiness and tension in the audience. Very effective, and amazing when used at the right times, but completely misused in Les Misérables. Here they appeared in scenes involving love and happiness. Although I doubt the average movie-goer notices such things consciously, I believe it would subconsciously detract from the emotional connect the audience makes with the on-screen characters, and the movie-nerd in me was not happy.Having said that, emotional connect is in no way an issue with Les Mis. There are some incredible scenes where, using a constant close-up and one long take, a character gets to pour his/her heart out to the audience, and this is felt through the bone. Anne Hathaway's 'I dreamed a dream' springs to mind as an example. During what must be a multiple-minute long constant take Anne sings the entire song in one take, whilst performing an incredible range both emotionally and vocally. (Singing whilst weeping hysterically can't be easy). I can neither confirm nor deny a heightened moistness of the eyeballs at this point.Les Misérables is quite the show, grand in design and performances. Its long runtime and excessive singing do make it a formidable watch however, certainly not for everyone's taste. And thus, even though my personal feelings would suggest a nine-out-of-ten rating, I want to be somewhat objective here, and suggest you only watch this if you are interested in either musicals or the story of Les Mis in general. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",7,0,1,21 January 2013
Taken 2," Uninspired and unfortunate continuation
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - When Taken released in 2008 it was a surprise hit. It had all the right elements for a great action flick; an excellent plot with strong motivations for the main protagonist, great action moments, and that iconic scene where Liam Neeson's character, Bryan Mills, threatens his daughter's kidnapper over the phone. Liam Neeson became an instant action hero because of it, and rightfully so.Now we are back for more in Taken 2, but unfortunately something is different. Much of what made the original great is missing from this sequel. This time around the plot is truly inferior. Let's lay out some of the reasons why.The plot for Taken revolved around the kidnap of young women for prostitution, a truly horrendous, but ultimately impersonal act. Which made it so great that Bryan Mills was there to put a stop to it. The bad guys simply picked 'the wrong man's' daughter to mess with. This time around the plot just revolves around revenge. It is very personal, and very simple. There is no logic at all to the motivations of the main antagonist. His son was murdered by Bryan Mills, but then again, his son had kidnapped and sold Bryan's daughter into prostitution. I'd say they are pretty even.Secondly, and most importantly, in the original movie there was a very strong sense of urgency. There was a short time-frame in which Bryan would be able to get his daughter back. This created a high-stress situation where there was no time for discussions or second guessing. Additionally, it created a realistic reason not to involve other parties, as this would take way too much time. However, in Taken 2, this sense of urgency is greatly reduced. Bryan even seems to leisurely take his time when having been kidnapped himself. Even the whole movie takes its time, with the prologue before the action even begins lasting a significant portion of the movie's runtime.These weak character motivations and lack of urgency in the plot create arduous discussions and conversations, the awkwardness of which just highlights how superficial the plot truly is. However, as this is an action movie the plot is not really the most important part; the action is.Unfortunately the action also leaves something to be desired. The fighting- and shooting-scenes are short and far in-between, and ultimately pretty forgettable. There is a nice car-chase, but this is rather ruined by Liam Neeson yelling the same line, 'Go faster!', over and over and over and over again.So is there any reason to go see this movie? Well, the acting here is pretty great. Liam Neeson is his quality self, and Maggie Grace and Famke Janssen prove their worth again as well. The great scenery is also worth noting, with beautiful Istanbul set as the location for the majority of the movie.Taken 2 shows as much creativity as its title, so sit down to watch this movie with the mind-set that it is not going to be a continuation of the greatness of the first Taken. Make sure not to think too critically (or preferably at all), and you should be reasonably entertained. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",4,1,1,21 January 2013
Looper," A reasonable and stylized movie, although ultimately somewhat forgettable
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - 'Looper' is a sci-fi action thriller starring Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt. The plot revolves around the concept of illegal time-travel. The movie is set in the year 2044, where time-travel hasn't been invented yet. But 30 years later, it will have been. It will be immediately made illegal, but the mob of the future still use it for one simple goal; body-disposal. When they need someone gone in the future, they simply send him back, and a 'Looper' in the movie's current time will kill and dispose of the body. Very 'clean'. This plot device is intriguing, but in the end it is rather detached from the ultimate direction of the film.If you have seen the trailer for 'Looper' I must warn you. There is a strange disconnect between the trailer and the actual movie. This had me somewhat confused for a reasonable portion of the movie, as it really wasn't heading in the direction I was anticipating beforehand. This is in no way a fault of the script or director, simply an unfortunate outcome of my preconceived notions of the film.The actual movie had somewhat less action and suspense than I anticipated, opting instead for a more slow and deliberate pace. The whole time- travelling angle of the plot was also less involved than I originally gleaned from the trailer, with it being used pretty much exclusively to set the stage for the story. I felt this was slightly off kilter with the premise of the movie. The slower parts of the movie can actually feel somewhat dull at times, rather than suspenseful, which is what I think the director was going for.There are some very fun aspects of the film though. Joseph Gordon-Levitt playing a younger version of Bruce Willis' character adds a few laughs and plenty of impressive make-up effects. The world in which this story is set is very well thought out and crafted with its own impressive style. This radiates throughout the movie, which truly has its own unique identity. This is brought to life with some impressive acting. Bruce Willis is as great as always, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt really stands his own in the lead role, bringing some impressive Bruce Willis impressions and mannerisms to the table. Emily Blunt also impresses with her depiction of the character 'Sara'. The actor that impressed me most however was the little kid who played 'Cid'. I'd wager he is about 6 years old and he gave one hell of a performance in the rather large role he plays in the film. It was really impressive irrespective of his age, but even more so because of it.'Looper' is the latest in a line of what I call 'Bruce Willis' Sci-Fi adventures'. Examples of previous installments of this are 'The Fifth Element' and 'Surrogates'. It seems Bruce ventures into another sci-fi project every few years, each one with the same basic result; A reasonable movie which is ultimately somewhat forgettable. 'Looper' is no exception, but at least brings a truly unique style to the genre. - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",7,1,2,21 January 2013
Cloud Atlas," An incredibly great movie, based on an amazing book.
","Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com - In a rather fortuitous string of events, I finished reading the novel 'Cloud Atlas' (by David Mitchell) in the lobby of the cinema, a mere 5 minutes before seeing the movie 'Cloud Atlas' in a sneak preview, a whole week before its release date. This put me in a wonderful position to reflect upon the book and the movie simultaneously. And I can tell you right now, both are incredible pieces of storytelling.The Cloud Atlas novel is very unique. At first glance it seems to be a collection of six separate short-stories. The first chapter consists of pages out of the diary of Adam Ewing, a notary from San Francisco. It is the nineteenth century, and Mr. Ewing is sailing the South Pacific on a ship called the 'Prophetess'. After reading about his adventures for about 40 pages, the narrative abruptly stops mid-sentence, and the next chapter begins. Here, we are reading letters that one Robert Frobisher sends to a friend. Frobisher is an aspiring musician who has escaped creditors by finding refuge in Belgium and is working as a musical aide in the 1930's. The next chapter follows Luisa Rey as she uncovers a conspiracy surrounding a nuclear power plant in the 1970s. Skip to 2012, London, where Timothy Cavendish, a publisher, finds himself in a ghastly ordeal. Next we jump to the year 2144, a dystopian future reminiscent of Aldous Huxley's classic 'Brave New World'. A fabricant named Somni~451 is recording her recollections for the oppressive state's archives, before being executed. Lastly we listen to the tale of Zachry, a simple goat-herder living on one of the smaller islands of what was once known as Hawaii. At this point civilisation has collapsed, to such a degree that even the year is no longer known.Each of these stories, except for Zachry's, has been interrupted halfway through. Now each story collapses back into the previous, rolling back the narrative in opposite order. We learn what happens to Sonmi~451, and we learn how things end for Timothy Cavendish, Luisa, Frobisher and lastly Adam Ewing.All along this journey we see call-backs and foreshadowing of stories that came before, or are yet to come. The reader experiences an ever increasing sense that things are connected in more ways than one. Similarities to the characters in each of the stories are revealed. Similarities to their faults, their plights, and their actions. An overarching theme is revealed bit by bit, and before you reach the final page you know that this are not six random short-stories, they are one amazing journey, which transcends time, transcends space, and transcends lives.'Souls cross ages like clouds cross skies' – David MitchellTry translating that to a movieEnter the Wachowski siblings, together with Tom Twyker. They take on the challenge, and bring us 'Cloud Atlas', the movie. Immediately there is a major difference from the book. The stories don't start out chronological, but seem to switch around every other scene, in seemingly random order. I start out confused Why would they do this? It makes the whole experience rather confusing for someone not familiar with the book. But soon the realization hits, that not the individual stories are show here, but rather the overarching storyline, the themes that bind all these adventures together. Scenes follow each other in the most logical order, running parallel to showcase their similarities. This creates a whole new experience. The movie starts out as this cacophony of mismatched stories, characters and scenes, then slowly but surely blends into a crescendo of epic proportions. Much like the titular 'Cloud Atlas Sextet for Orchestra' (OST).'Lifetime's music, arriving all at once. Boundaries between noise and sound are conventions, I see now. All boundaries are conventions, national ones too. One may transcend any convention, if only one can first conceive of doing so.' – David Mitchell (p. 479)This is my favorite quote from the book, and, to my great pleasure, is used ad verbatim in the movie.Cloud Atlas is a rare movie that is both viscerally and intellectually engaging. There are awesome action sequences here, but this is no brainless action-flick. I fear Cloud Atlas will not stay in cinemas long, as it is too complex for the average movie-goer. My gauging of the audience with which I saw Cloud Atlas was infuriating. Some of them left after a mere 15 minutes. Some walked off 1,5 hours or more into the movie. I heard after the movie was over, that so many people still did not see any correlations between the six stories, and I was saddened by their close-mindedness. It is not that it is incredibly difficult to comprehend; it is just that the average movie-goer wants to be entertained without having to think too much. That certainly does not work with Cloud Atlas.Please go see this movie, and prove to the entire movie-making business that there still is a market for movies such as this. Movies with more substance than 'Expendables 3'. I will certainly do my part by going to see this movie a second time. I am sure I missed so much the first time around.A multitude of tiny details within the film enriched the experience of the story. I loved these little nods to the connectedness of everything. The way Luisa Rey's apartment number was 451 (as in Somni~451), or the way the violinist in the Nea So Corpos' slum played Frobisher's Cloud Atlas Sextet. And the way the waistcoat-button from Adam Ewing, is used as an ornamental feature on the necklace that Zachry wears. It is small things like this that I want to explore on a more thorough viewing of Cloud Atlas.I can not stress enough how incredibly great this movie truly is. Go see it now! - Review originally posted on InspirationRation.com",10,6,12,21 January 2013
