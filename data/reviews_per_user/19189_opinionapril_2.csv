Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows," If you have never read Sherlock Holmes, this is a good movie
","If you have never read Sherlock Holmes, this is a good movie, very, very good. And if you have read Sherlock Holmes, or all of them as I have, it is better. Poor old Conan Doyle came to hate his creation, and killed him off. And it almost worked, he got so much flak about it, from everyone he had to bring him back. When Gilbert, the famous actor in the U.S. of that time wrote to Conan Doyle asking his permission to use the Sherlock Holmes character in his stage production, and with what limitations, Conan Doyle replied 'Murder him, marry him, do what you like with him'. This is a good movie, it has a good story. I would have like Robert Downey jr. to be taller, but you can't have everything. Enjoy.",10,1,10,18 December 2011
Beowulf," More cartoon than movie, poor technique very distracting
","Can not say I liked the movie. I found that the movie was a poorly made cartoon. About the grade of a slightly below average computer game. I could have enjoyed it, the plot was decent even clever and interesting but the face figures were so flat one was constantly jolted back that one is looking at a cartoon.And again, the animation was jerky at times and too flippant in its' disregard of gravity in the action scenes to keep one involved. As soon as you get into the movie, a scene comes up that you know is just not right and out of the movie you pop.It could have been done much better and then it would have been entertaining.",3,5,10,19 November 2007
