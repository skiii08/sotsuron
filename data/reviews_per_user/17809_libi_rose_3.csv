"The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert"," Fabulous
","Yes, it is filled with stereotypes. Yes, that should be a bad thing. But it isn't. Priscilla has been a favorite of mine for so long. It is charming, funny, and a great movie to sing along to. Yes, the characters are stereotypical. But I personally know people who are JUST LIKE each of the characters. And the jokes, the one liners, are laugh out loud funny, even after 3 or 4 or 50 times. The makeup is spectacular, the costuming is incredible. The shots of the Australian outback are magnificent. And underneath it all there is a vivacious, bubbly innocence that creeps under your skin and makes you feel good.",10,1,2,13 December 2002
Barry Lyndon," beautiful
","Ernesto, one of the wisest men I've met, refers to this film as the most gorgeous film ever made. After seeing it in his class (on a slightly beat up, faded, reddish print, no less) I am inclined to agree. Each shot was based upon a painting from the era, each frame would be worthy of hanging on a wall. And this is the impression I got from a beat up, reddish, faded print. I can only imagine the full power of this film on a high quality print. The cinematography is, as is the norm with Stanley, astounding. But it is brought to an entirely new level. The colours are rich without being overpowering, the lighting is superb and ideal. The use of the telephoto lens in order to flatten out the depth of field and bring the visual similarity even closer to that of a painting had a stunning effect. And the fact that all but one scene was shot with natural light (sun or candle light) is just an added little touch of necessary bravura. I could watch this film with the sound off and it would be just as engrossing.",Null,1,2,28 March 2004
Braveheart," it is...
","I love this movie. That said...This movie is not the best of epics, true. But it is a beautiful, moving, spectacular sensory experience. The music, the cinematography, the story. Everyone should live their life as this film instructs us to do. It makes me cry every time I watch it. The point of film is to allow us to fantasize. And the story given to us by this film is one of the most worthy fantasies anyone could have.",Null,0,1,13 December 2002
