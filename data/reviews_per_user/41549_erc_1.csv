The Blair Witch Project," Waste of Money
","The only creepy thing about this film is the fact that there are people out there who actually liked it.  I found some of the character dialog mildly entertaining.  I almost didn't go to see the movie, since I new that it was contrived.  My 15 year old daughter wanted to go, so we went, along with a few others.  My daughter has the typical phobias of a teenager, but she laughed long and hard, along with the rest of the theatre, when this sad film ended. This movie is a depressing cross between MTV's 'Road Rules' and the stupidest scary movie you can think of.  The only reason I'm glad I saw this film is that I can warn others about it's brain-sucking idiocy.  This movie is like the Jerry Springer show.  I caters to the lowest-common denominator in our society.  To those of you who were actually 'scared' by this movie....  what is your problem?  'Suspend Disbelief' does not mean 'Suspend Intelligence'.  This movie is the 'The Three Stooges Go Camping'. Don't waste your money like I did, unless it's for a school assignment like 'The Really Crappy Movie Project'.",Null,0,1,3 August 1999
