Hereditary," GO IN WITH A SHOT OF WHISKEY AND AN OPEN MIND
","This was a film where, even after watching the trailer, there was still a mystery behind it...and that's how the film was executed. Each turn was a shock and completely new to anything I have ever seen. This was a film that will stick with you do to it's imagery and emotional effect it has; mainly because it also has scenes that deal with horrific family events that are just heartbreaking and astonishing to watch. That is a horror that I can bet the majority of audiences have never seen before. It will without a doubt obtain cult status after it's release. The film was shot beautifully and everything about it will be new to audiences. A terrifying look at what may lie beneath our family's roots. I recommend you go in with a shot of wiskey and an open mind.",9,24,50,9 June 2018
