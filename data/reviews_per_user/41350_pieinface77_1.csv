Marie Antoinette," you people are stupid
","For all of you stupid clowns that talk about how this film does not deal with the many intricacies of French history, I have this to say: THE FILM IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY. It is told from the very myopic point of view of Marie Antoinette, who knew very little of what was going on outside of Versailles.Also, some people complained about how anachronistic the use of 80s music was in the film. You people are also idiots. Picasso once said that art does not mimic nature. Art and the thing it represents are entirely separate entities. Similarly, this film cannot and should not attempt to capture the 'authentic' feel of 18th century France. What Coppola does do, successfully, is capture certain timeless feelings and emotions. One way she does this is through the use of music that fits the culture of excess that surrounded the French aristocracy.I didn't love the movie, mainly because I found it difficult to connect to. A situation like the one in which Marie Antoinette finds herself is very far removed from the reality of most people's lives.",8,0,1,27 November 2006
