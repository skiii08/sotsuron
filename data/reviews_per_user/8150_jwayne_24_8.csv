The Hunger Games: Mockingjay - Part 1," not as bad as others say
","First of all let me say that I have read the books and this movie does not skip over the love triangle and it is not 'dull and boring' in my opinion.Yes a lot of the movie takes place below ground in a bunker but so does the first half OF THE BOOK. Not every scene has to be dramatic or action packed to convey meaning.Jennifer Lawrence was once again awesome as Katniss. However, for me there were two big surprises. First, I am no Woody Harrelson fan, but he is great as Haymitch and may be my favorite character after Katniss and Peeta.Second, after reading the novels, I wasn't sure who I would have picked as President Snow. However, Donald Sutherland is perfect and he could not have been better cast. Lastly, if anything about this movie is boring, its Liam Hemsworth's Gale. I like Liam, but his portrayal of Gale lacks any emotion or action for me.I think this movie is well worth seeing and I can't wait for Part 2.",9,0,7,18 April 2015
Beauty and the Beast," All-Time Classic
","Beauty and the Beast in in the top three of all time Disney films in my book. Everything about this movie was spot on. The storyline of falling in love with the Beast despite his appearance and being repulsed by Gaston in spite of his handsomeness was inspiring and rings true today. The special effects were amazing, and I absolutely LOVED Chip. And, finally, the songs. What can you say but, WOW! Disney films always have a good soundtrack, but Beauty and the Beast(both versions) are simply put, perfection. This movie is just as great today as it was in 1992 and it deserves its status as a classic and I would love to see it appreciated by a new generation of kids and adults.",10,3,3,5 April 2015
North by Northwest," Another winner
","Once again Cary Grant and Alfred Hitchcock team up to create a gem of a film, this time with Eva Marie Saint as leading lady. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, who is mistaken for another man and pursued by Philip VanDamme (James Mason) and his henchman, Leonard. Along the way, Thornhill is framed for murder and falls in love with a beautiful blonde Eve Kendall (Eva Marie Saint), who may or may not be who she appears. Leo G. Carroll is excellent as the Professor, with his completely stone faced wit and dry sense of humor. The crop duster scene and the final showdown on Mount Rushmore are not only the highlights of the film, but two of the best action sequences of all time. Every actor in this film appeared to have enjoyed making it and it shows, as it is always a joy to watch a Hitchcock or Grant film, especially their collaborations. This move gets an A in my book!",10,1,4,31 July 2015
The Little Mermaid," Couldn't ask for a better Disney film
","When I recently rewatched this film after 20 years, it struck me that I enjoyed it every bit as much, if not more, than when I was a child.Disney created in Ariel, one of their greatest princesses. Yes, she was impulsive and headstrong, but she was also, inquisitive, loving and kindhearted.One of the great pleasures of this movie, was remembering how great animation looked before the days of Pixar(although Disney films still look great too!). In my opinion, the animation holds up very well 26 years later.The cast of characters was extremely enjoyable - evil Ursula, funny Sebastian, loyal Flounder and of course, the man Ariel loved, Prince Eric.What truly made this movie a classic was the songs, particularly Under the Sea and Part of Your World, which Jodi Benson done a absolutely perfect job on.The Little Mermaid belongs in the top five all time Disney films in terms of both the movie and the soundtrack. I will always enjoy this film and I can only wish that a new generation would appreciate it like it deserves to be!",10,1,1,8 April 2015
Ice Age," Hilarious
","This is one of the funniest animated films I have ever seen. And the funniest single character is Scrat. You can't help but feel for him and how he always 'almost' gets his acorn only to have the worst luck. However the main story is very touching in its own way. Sid the sloth is left behind by his family on the way to escaping the coming ice age. He meets up with Manny, a crusty wooly mammoth voiced by Ray Romano, who does a fantastic job. They come upon a mother and her infant and while the mother dies in the icy water they rescue the baby and set off to return him to his own 'herd.' Along the way they pick up Diego, a sabre tooth tiger who is leading them into an ambush by his pack. As time goes on, though, Diego warms up to them all and they end up saving each others life several times over. In the end they all fall in love with the kid, return him to his tribe, and leave as friends. To be an animated film, this has a very moving and emotional storyline and an excellent climax. Its just a shame that I didn't watch this until now, over 13 years after it was released. My Grade: B+.",9,0,1,23 September 2015
The Lion King," As Good As It Gets!
","This movie truly is a classic and one of the best films I have ever seen, even after 21 years since its release. Timon and Pumbaa are hilarious and so is Rafiki the baboon.The story of growing up between Simba and Mufasa is especially touching and can teach a lot to us today. And of course, the jealousy and betrayal of Scar are themes that echo real life.And, of course, the fact that Simba and Nala have their own cub at the end is great. This movie has a great voice cast, awesome animation, a great storyline, and as with all of the early to mid 90s Disney films, an absolutely perfect soundtrack.Truly deserving of its tag as Disney's best film until Frozen, it will always be a classic to me.",10,2,2,8 April 2015
Aladdin," It Doesn't Get Any Better
","I cannot make it any plainer than this: Aladdin is not just a great film, it is one of the top 5 Disney films EVER. Most everyone knows the story: Aladdin, who is a peasant meets and falls in love with Princess Jasmine, who by law can only marry a royal. Jafar, the evil sorceror, uses Aladdin's trusting nature against him to try and steal the magic lamp hidden in the cave, but it doesn't work. Aladdin brings forth the genie and uses the wishes to make him a prince. However, the Genie cannot make Jasmine love him.Jafar eventually gains control of the lamp and exposes Aladdin as a peasant and it looks like he is going to win and crush everyone. However, his greed destroys him at the last second and Jasmine proclaims her love for Aladdin and chooses him as her husband-to-be.While that alone would make a great movie, the surrounding characters and nuances are what make it so fantastic. The animation is stunning, made even more so by the fact that it is before current CGI-technology. Second, the supporting characters of Abu, Raja and Iago are hilarious. And, third, the song 'Whole New World' is simply perfect, one of Disney's crowning greats (both the movie and soundtrack versions are great!) In the end, Aladdin is quite simply the perfect movie, animated or otherwise. It can make adults and kids alike feel joy and happiness and that's what a movie is meant to do. This is a film that I have and will continue to love for as long as I possibly can. Quite simply, this is Disney's crown jewel!!!",10,1,3,22 April 2015
Pocahontas," Vastly underrated
","This was the most under-appreciated Disney film of all time. I rewatched it last night and finally grasped just how great it was over 20 years later.The animation and scenery were both gorgeous and the colors in the Virginia countryside were fantastic. No, it wasn't historically accurate, but it did contain issues that hold significance to this day. I truly believe that this film belongs in the top 5 Disney films ever.Pocahontas character was the most realistic Disney figure to that point and the animal characters were hilarious. One can only hope that with the passing of time that Pocahontas will get the respect it deserves.",9,3,7,18 September 2016
