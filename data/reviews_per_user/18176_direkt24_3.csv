Catch Me If You Can," These characters are very lonely (SPOILERS INSIDE)
","This movie is much darker than it seems to be on the outside.(SPOILERS AHEAD)!!Christopher Walken I think steals the show in his very limited role , allthough Tom Hanks and Leo do their parts convincingly.We see Frank's parents at the beginning at their home dancing and looking very much in love and happy, but things turn very quickly when Frank's mother starts to get involved with another man who was supposed to be a friend of the family ( can't trust anybody).Anyway Frank's parents are forced to divorce and Leonardo Di Caprios character Frank is forced to decide whether he wants to stay with his mom or dad by a simple check of a box on paper.
Totally devastated by what is going on at home Frank decides to take the blank checks Frank's father gave to him and leave home on a life changing escapade of false identity and a search for meaning in his life.At certain parts I thought were very sad especially ,where Frank and his Dad meet up at certain points throughout the film to talk about Frank's false success in life.Christopher walken and Leo shine during these parts more than any other parts of the film.Frank still thinks material items will get his Mom and dad back together and that's just not how life works.The main reason imo Frank goes on this venture is to try and find a way for his parents to get back together through his material success through his false identities, But once reality hits and Frank finds out his Mom is remarried his whole world crashes once again and he wants out of this adventure , which is shown at the bar scene where he calls carl in an attempt to end this fiasco, you really see that Dicaprio's character is still just a young 17 year old kid at this part, very good acting here.We also  find out throughout the film that Carl (Hanks character)is also a very lonely person ,he is a divorced man who hasn't seen his daughter Grace too much since the split and is also looking for a meaning to his life.Carl and Frank sort of build a subliminal bond throughout the film which comes together at the end.We see Frank towards the very end looking to run away from his problems again but once he finds out nobody is chasing him any more the game is over and decides to live a normal life.It's at this point again that the movie is very subliminally sad , Frank and Carl though not verbally mentioning it to each other actually look at each other and know that they have built sort of a father son relationship through this crazy ordeal and decide to become friends.Again a much darker film than perceived at first about loss and wanting things back to normal no matter what.Some holes but not enough to render the film , definitely worth a watch.",Null,0,1,29 June 2003
The Ring," More of a mystery than horror but still good
","Other than maybe 4 separate situations during the movie , i wouldn't really characterize this film as a horror but more of a thriller /mystery.Not saying that's bad being overall , i enjoyed this film.( SPOILERS AHEAD ).. The beginning 10 minutes of the film reminded me to much of the movie Scream so with that said i didnt enjoy maybe the first 10 to 12  minutes of the film on shear unoriginality IMO.Now i will credit the movie a little where other people I spoke to downplayed the movie , which is the beginning middle parts of the movie where we have Naomi Watts(Rachel) watching the videotape and having to find out the origin of the tape which i actually liked. The scenery is beautiful and the clues Naomi searches out add to the drama of the film.Again I took all of this as more of a drama than a horror being I was trying to guess the whole time instead of jumping or getting chills.There are many scenes which stand out in my head even when i am not even thinking of the movie.That alone is a reason to see this film.Rachel's son's demeanor and glare throughout the film were a welcomed presence, that definitely added to the movie.The end i felt overall was a little corny being Samarah just wanted to be heard and that is why ultimately Rachel and her son don't die , being that Rachel made a copy and showed it to her ex beau and later has her son make a copy so he also survives.In my eyes being heard doesnt mean making copies of a video tape and showing it to people when the tape had no real answers from Samarah anyway , so how is she being heard ? But i won't go any further on why i didn't like the film being the scenery and the mystery of the tape make this film a stand out .Overall id give it a 7.5 - 10 not .Some flaws but not enough to bring the movie down , go see this",Null,0,0,9 March 2003
Vanilla Sky," Open your eyes !!
","'Open your eyes' is a good no it's a great opening line for all the people bashing this film.Cameron Crowe even gives you a hint in the opening line that this isn't going to be your average popcorn film but a film you are going to have to open your eyes a little wider (hmm makes me think of another film  that went under the radar and was bashed 'Eyes Wide shut' Kubrick is the man by the way)The premise is their for you people,next time a film opens up with a line having to do with opening your eyes wider or looking closer , if you are not open minded just don't view the film , simple as that.Anyway I viewed this movie when it first came out and was blown away, touches on so many feelings and emotions a summary from me will not do the movie justice.You will just have to view this film on your own and decide what you think of it. Again try and do what the opening scene pushes us the audience to do 'Open our Eyes'.",10,0,1,28 June 2003
