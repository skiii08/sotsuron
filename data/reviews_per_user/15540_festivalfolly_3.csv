Moneyball," Even if you're not a baseball fan, 'Moneyball' scores.
","Even if you're not a baseball, go and see Moneyball. I saw it recently, and though it's taken me a few weeks, I am here writing a review. Why? Because I thought it was a fun film with some great performances.Start with Brad Pitt, playing Billy Beane, the GM of the bargain basement Oakland A's. Beane has to find ways to seek players that are in the bargain bin of free agency, and get results out of them. Pitt conveys both Beane's frustration with his situation, and his ability to 'adapt or die.' As the real-life Beane did, Pitt adapts.How about Jonah Hill playing the fictitious Peter Brand character (loosely based on Paul DePodesta, who was Billy's assistant GM and now in a similar role with the New York Metropolitans)? This was a different role for him - not slapstick - and he shines in it. As I saw one other IMDb reviewer say, not many other actors could have pulled off the closed fist. See the movie.Then, there's Philip Seymour Hoffman, playing the stubborn Art Howe - the manager that just won't give in to Beane's 'Saber-Metrics' philosopy. He is so staunch in his ways, makes you frustrated to watch ... but in a good way.But, ultimately, this movie does not candy-coat. It shows Beane's strengths, and his failures (both as a player, and in some of his goals), although the movie itself is anything but. See it, as I think it will be up for a number of awards at some point next year.",7,1,2,10 October 2011
Drive," This interesting Indie is no Thief
","Enjoyed 'Drive,' and I would describe it as an interesting Indie film, one that I would like to see again to see what I pick up the second time around.The unnamed lead character - 'Driver' - is essentially a getaway driver with his own set of rules and boundaries. After meeting the girl next door - literally - he decides to look after her and her son, Benicio. When the girl's boyfriend - and Benicio's father - gets out of prison, Driver decides to help him out of a jam, by being his driver. Unfortunately, the heist goes wrong, and that is where the real drama begins ...Interesting, that they used huge pieces of The Social Network soundtrack, while the other songs seemed to be reminiscent of the quintessential 1980s action flick, which is appropriate because Drive reminded me of an early 80s action/drama, the James Caan film 'Thief,' though I liked Thief better. It even had a similar scripted title font, and the endings were comparable, though you won't necessarily guess this one.Drive does have it's 'lapses' which don't ruin the movie at all. The action and suspense makes up for the lapses. In fact, it also reminded me a little of Luc Besson's 'Leon The Professional.' The lead character is very child-like, much like Jean Reno's title character.The ending is very interesting, though I won't say much about it. Strange, but interesting indie.",8,0,1,10 October 2011
In Time," Sci Fi Gem from Andrew Niccol
","Really enjoyed this Sci Fi gem from Andrew Niccol, and amazed at the total transformation of Justin Timberlake from boyband singer to actor. As good as he was in The Social Network, he's even better in In Time.The basic theme of the movie - where everyone stops aging at 25, however, after that you are only given one year and time is now the currency; in order to keep living you need to acquire and save up more time - is an interesting one. If someone were to compile enough time, one could be immortal. But, oh, there are serious and deadly consequences.Just as in our current day and age, 'this future,' has a tough economy and times are tough. Most people are living day-to-day ... literally. You run out of time, you run out of time.Our hero played by Justin Timberlake is just one of those suffering out the tough economy. Much like Niccol's Gattaca, this too is a cautionary tale. And, the way the rich seem to hord their fortune of time, seems to be a metaphor for the way the less fortunate are treated in our current day and age.Packed with action scenes and suspense, I really enjoyed the film .... and the chemistry between Timberlake and Amanda Seyfried. Moreover, I thought this was Seyfried's best role.See In Time in theaters, and you will not be disappointed. Truly is a Sci Fi gem.",8,2,6,3 November 2011
