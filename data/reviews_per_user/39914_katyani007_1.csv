Angels & Demons," Pretty lousy movie with jerky camera movement
","There have been many comments on this movie so I need not say a lot. My chief complain is the jerky camera movement and close up shots. It appears that Hollywood directors are struggling to be able to provide a fast paced action filled drama in this age of short viewer attention spans, video games and the internet. So what do they do? They create an illusion of this by making the camera jerk a lot so that you get dizzy while watching the movie. The camera is also too close to the actors, almost like in their face.As some of the commentators have mentioned the movie is nothing but a grown up treasure hunt. There is no character development, no realities of everyday existence, no deliberation on the interpersonal conflicts or bonds that may develop. Is this movie a mirror of our society?",1,19,50,16 May 2009
