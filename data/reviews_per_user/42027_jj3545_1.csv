Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," great movie must see...
","I gave this movie a 10 because I have never laughed so hard in the theater in a while maybe since There's Something About Mary. But look I am writing this mainly for all the people who discuss the racism of the movie here on IMDb, listen this is in fact a movie okay it is not a political statement it is just comedy. I really believe that most of the people who discuss this movie like a political statement towards 3rd world countries are absolutely out of line. Leave it be to the fact that indeed this is a movie, and going into this movie you must have seen Ali G at some point in your life and if you watched Ali G and found it offensive, because lets face it this is 90 minute segment of Borat.... THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE NOT WENT TO SEE THIS MOVIE IDIOTS. I think a lot of you go just to pick it thin on IMDb seriously everyone get a job and life.... Great movie BORAT fans go check it out hilarious....",10,6,20,26 October 2006
