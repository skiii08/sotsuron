The Devil's Advocate," Al Pacino was born for this
","I've seen this movie a hundred times and it's still great! everyone likes a cool Satan... I know I do... and Al Pacino is just brilliant doing it... he makes it all look just fun and hot! and that's the whole thing isn't it? heaven's boring and hell is... well... something completely different ;PKeanu Reeves can act... sure he can! but let's not get carried away... he doesn't even get close to what Charlize and Pacino did with their roles!! Charlize Theron, I don't like her that much but she's brilliant!! Al Pacino... I've said it... he's the perfect devil!!the story isn't that original... we've all heard it before but the way it's told is great! of course it has a great ending and has great scenes, beautifully made... great dramatic scenes... great speeches... specially by the devil himself... and they didn't even messed it up with monsters and those other stupid things that so often feature in movies about this kind of things... just watch it... and watch it again! it's a great movie. great entertainment!",8,0,1,24 March 2006
Crash," Could be good
",I just saw Crash last night and I must say I wasn't impressed. Which is a shame because I thought the movie had something special about it but it was ruined.I liked the interaction between all those stories and characters and thought the way Haggis explored the conflict of feelings between all of them was quite brilliantly done! The interpretations were mostly really good also.But then I think he lost it because he tried to give it too much that tragedy feeling which had no reason to be since the tragedy was already there.. so he did that ridiculous last scene 'Ã  la Magnolia' with the song playing loud and clear and showing all the characters in their suffering or feeling better about themselves.. I think Haggis went for the easy way of touching people. But I don't think he needed that.Sorry about my English.,6,6,8,27 September 2006
The Dark Knight Rises," Cheap Compilation of Trailers
","This is not so much a comment as it is a letter to the Nolan brothers for whom I will choose to keep respecting albeit them having stolen almost 3 hours of my life and replaced them with over sized crap.I was incredibly motivated to watch Batman Begins (although I was not a fan of the 'original' Batman movies) simply due to the fact that Nolan and Bale had grabbed hold of the project. I was not disappointed. Then the Dark Knight came up, and I was absolutely blown away. I decided then to keep some distance from TDKR so as to prevent it disappointing me, and now.. I just wish I had erased from my mind that this movie even existed.Mr. Nolan, I want my money back. The movie was an unbelievable shower of trailers at a nauseating speed and absolutely no regard for storytelling. The interpretations might be flawless but are as well a victim of this absolute rubbish screenplay which left me gasping for air after repeatedly having attempted to choke in my own vomit.Dear sir Mr. Nolan, this is misbehaving.",2,11,22,21 November 2012
