Angels & Demons," Entertaining, if you can ignore the plot holes
","Not having read the book (or any books by Dan Brown), I found this flick rather entertaining when I watched it just recently on a long-haul flight. So yes, the movie serves its purpose of killing approx. 140 minutes of your time on a rainy afternoon, during travel et cetera. But does it accomplish this in a smart way?No, and this for several reasons: First of all, it's one of the movies where the protagonists keep on talking and explain even the most basic things, so the audience will get it. Second, there is no wasted screen time: If they mention something, you can be very sure it will be used in a certain way or become a danger to someone later on.However, the obvious plot holes bothered me much more (and the per se nice twist at the end opens those holes even wider): Why, for God's sake (sic!), all the effort from the evil guy? Yes, sure, he wants us to believe something wicked is going on, but let's admit that the first body probably would have never been found - Even Langdon found the entrance merely by chance. Just shooting the four hostages would have severed the purpose just fine. Why bring in Langdon at all? So somebody could find the bodies, and in the same way to put the whole operation at risk? What if Langdon failed to find the bomb? In other words, the movie failed to explain the villain's motivation for all this in any plausible way, especially as all the other stuff is explained over and over again.Then there is this professional killer who manages to virtually eliminate half of Rome's police force (ammunition never runs out, of course), but is stupid enough to... well, find out for yourself. Or just basic things, such as the retina scanner: The bad guy cuts out somebodies eye to bypass the retina scanner. However, he needs to go through it to get into the specific lab where the guy that he murders sits. Don't tell me you only need to scan your eye on the way out, but not in. Even if that would be the case, there was blood on the scanner on the outside, but the eye is on the inside, close to the dead body. Hello?! And the movie is full of such things. Enjoy!",5,0,0,5 August 2014
Gravity," Entertaining, modern disaster movie.
","To have yourself entertained for approx. 90 minutes the movie just works perfectly fine, containing all the usual clichés.Pity the age of movies that build up a story seems to be gone. We are almost immediately in midst the action: Why is a medical doctor repairing the Hubble telescope? Who are these people? So I didn't care much about the other guy in the background to have a piece of debris shot through his brain. Nor did I care, other than pure curiosity if the usual clichés will be broken, about the fate of Kowalski and Stone.It's perfectly all right to drop some realism for drama, so it doesn't bother me that e.g. the astronauts don't wear diapers under the space suit. Yet other stuff irritates me, e.g. various (expensive) space stations have been evacuated and are under threat of destruction, and the only guy she is able to communicate with is some drunken amateur radio operator in the tundra?!I didn't know much about the story when I went to watch Gravity. I expected it to be more about drifting helpless in space rather than racing from one doomed space station to the next one.The movie would have gained a lot by a slower pace: Build up story and characters, so the viewer cares about the people involved. And some more suspense instead of action.One further remark: It is definitely not a science fiction movie, but a disaster/action drama. For a good recent SciFi movie stick to Sunshine, which is way too underrated.",6,2,4,9 March 2014
Unbreakable," overrated, yet recommendable
","A movie I have mixed feelings about. First of all, it might be a bit overrated. Yet I cannot say that I disliked it. Shyamalan proves his skills for sure.Lets take the train ride at the beginning for example: the camera - camera perspectives in general were mostly impressive - moving to get a glance at the characters though the gap between the seats. And as more bridges the train passes as more threatening they get; until a point is reached were everybody is aware that something is about to happen.As I am not keen on comics the story itself didn't appeal to me, but I like the way it is told. The characters are not flat and the casting is well done. The atmosphere is just right and the film is rather calm.Probably some will be disappointed by the lack of action, as violence is not directly shown.I usually don't like surprise endings, but it would have lost its effect if the audience had known it in the first place. It could be worth seeing it a second.",6,0,0,6 January 2001
The Patriot," a meager story about revenge takes place in an epic scenery
","Although I didn't expect much as the last few works done by Emmerich have disappointed me, it was even worse. Let's leave the historical correctness out of it. A movie can be based in a certain time, without the need of being accurate. After all the war is just a framework for the so often told story of simple revenge.At certain points exaggerated violence as seen in Martin's first attack, when he suddenly becomes berserk, can be used to put the whole into question. If it would have been just left like that. Emmerich would have suddenly turned his films to a new direction -- the audience has to think about the protagonist's actions. But no! Right afterwards the actions are all justified. Either by some brutalities done by the truly evil English or simply by witty behaviour of Martin. So it all ends up in the black/white scheme again. What is evil and what is good is defined by the colour of their uniform: you can switch your brains off.Unfortunately a movie is not simply made by nice photography and sophisticated battle scenes; it's the story and the characters it lives from. The characters are flat and act out of simple motives. Worse, most of them are spoken about, just to make sure, that every last person sitting in the cinema finally gets it...",2,2,4,31 August 2000
