Minority Report," entertaining, but derivative
","The visual effects were stunning, but more money could (and should) have been spent to enhance the plot. Most of the plot 'twists' were visible a mile away, and the all of them have been done ad nauseum.The movie did address some rather interesting points about privacy (or lack thereof), but could have gone deeper into the way we treat those who are different than we are, and whether 'the good of the many outweighs the good of the few.'Still, it is worth seeing on the big screen, but only if you are paying matinee prices.",7,0,0,4 August 2002
