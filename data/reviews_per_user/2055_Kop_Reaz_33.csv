Skyfall," A new high
","I am neither a fan of the genre nor the franchise. The only reason I decided to watch this film is because Daniel Craig and I support the same team.So there I was started watching Skyfall. First part of the movie was kind of slow. I started regretting my decision. Then it started to dazzle me, with beautiful visuals, film editing and cinematography and sub plots. They didn't introduce us anything new. It was all recycled from regular action movies. But the way they executed the small parts, I can't find the proper adjective to praise them. All the minor pieces that makes a film, they were proper class in this film. I am hooked up. I mean before watching Skyfall I didn't care for James Bond series. Sure I would have watched a spy film every now and then. But that was it. And now I am eagerly waiting for the next James Bond film. In my book that's a huge success, hooking up a new fan who thinks the spy genre is lame.This film is pure class. Probably the classiest film I've watched in my life. And dare I say the best British film of all time.",8,1,7,19 October 2014
Inglourious Basterds," '...I think this might be my masterpiece'
","The last dialogue of the movie. I agree with Tarantino. This is his masterpiece. Why? I've enjoyed the entire 2.5 hours. The acting performances were very good. And most importantly there was a satisfying ending.Forget about the history. Watch it like a movie. Other than that you can't connect with it. Remember connection is very important.Inglourious Basterds is a complete film from artistic point of view. It is not a serious film. It will make you laugh out loud, root for the good guys, fear the villains, feel sorry for the suffered ones.There are two outstanding parts in this film. The casting and Christopher Waltz performance. Waltz Oscar is a well deserved one. Truthfully this is the best performance in villains role I've seen since Heath Ledger's Joker. The casting is phenomenal. The 'Basterds' are perfect.A downside of the film is that we are acquainted with Tarantino's style. For this most of the 'unexpected scenes' didn't surprise me. Still he managed to steal some individual moments from my consciousness.Final Verdict: Inglourious Basterds is slightly underrated. My rating is 8.5/10.",8,1,1,5 January 2015
Silent Hill," They messed up (Can't improve something? Then don't change it.)
","If the director liked the game so much why did he change it?All the great things (yes 'great things') about this film are directly taken from the game. Everything else, that came from the directors head, are poor. The screenplay was awful (I wanna cry). Poor dialogues. Cheap casting. The story itself is a disgrace to the game. Very very bad acting. Special effects were better than I expected (had to be they had 50m $). Film editing and cinematography was reasonable. The score was great ( directly from the game).There were no special character. Everyone single one of them were annoying. All the major characters were women (what kind of sexism is this?). The writer tried to give proper explanation to everything (come on it's a horror film). But he left us hanging in the ending (changed another good thing from the game).But the most positive note is this,for a video game spin off film, it's a pretty good one.",5,0,1,2 November 2014
Interstellar," 'SCIENCE! BITCH!' -Jesse, PInkman
","That's my first reaction after watching Interstellar. The film itself is out of the world, both literally and metaphorically. It's an emotional voyage through space and time. Scientifically speaking, it's flawless. This is a true science fiction. They kept the stuffs we already know unchanged. And fictionalized the stuffs we yet to know. I don't understand people who don't understand physics going nuts over the science of Interstellar. *Nolan didn't show anything impossible*.The visuals is astronomically beautiful. And the musical score is even better. They kept me on the edge of my seat. I could feel every minutes of this film. Interstellar deserves this years Oscars in every visual and musical category. If Interstellar doesn't win all the five Oscars it has been nominated in, the Academy should get rid of these categories for good.Interstellar is a story of a love between a father and daughter, a promise and an inspirational journey to save the humanity. It is set in the future where survival is the ultimate goal. Which is why I felt the casts could not relate to their characters. Specially Mackenzie Foy. Her amateurish performance is the only downside of this film.Now excuse me I need to reevaluate my view on life, earth, humanity and God. (That's why I love the Nolans. They always reminds me how petty my life is right now and how much more I can do with it. There are limitless possibilities.)",8,3,6,22 January 2015
Pacific Rim," Cheap
","This movie is wrong on so many levels, I don't know where to begin. So I'm starting with the only positive note I have found. The battle scenes are so awesome. The giant robots and monster fist fighting, that's something I'd really love to see again.Now for the easier part of my writing, the story is so familiar. This is the most common military vs alien story. 'Our hero loses his older brother in the first part and drifts away from his job. Then when the world faces an alien invasion threat, a general/commander brings that hero back our last resort. But since he left, a new poster boy has risen, who is now jealous of the old hero's return. Men upstairs give some wrong orders. The commander decides to disobey. He gives a cheap motivational speech.'Then comes the final battle. Non-American comrades die easily as some overrated soldiers. Disaster porn. Our hero comes to save the day. More disaster porn. Disaster porn, disaster porn.'The egotistic poster boy sacrifices himself to give our hero one last chance to save the world. But our hero wastes that extra time for his love. That stupid decision makes everyone in front of monitors think the hero died. But the hero comes back from death. And of course he saves the world.'Now remember how many times have we seen this crap before. You had a budget of 190 millions dollar. Get a better story. Then get better actors. The performances of the actors were very awkward for me, I don't wanna elaborate.You've seen this movie before, trust me. Don't waste 2 hours.",3,2,3,11 June 2014
Forrest Gump," Not my favorite but the Best I've watched so far
","This is the only film for which I can use the word 'Beautiful' without any hesitation. 6 Academy Awards, $677,387,716 in box office & 8.8 rating in IMDb combined don't say it all.Tom Hanks portrayed the role of Forest Gump more than perfectly. Other supporting actor and actresses weren't that memorable. But that's for the sake of the story. Robert Zemeckis probably taught us how to direct. Hanks & Zemeckis did the best job of their career.Film editing was flawless. They shot the film in different locations and every single one of them added a new level of greatness to the film. The musics weren't much noticeable. Also weren't the visual effects. Which is actually a big success, because I thought they didn't use any visual effect.The story is simple, plain and for some mysterious reason also sad. Forest Gump will teach you how to live life. Miracles and shits both happen for a definite reason. You'll find out what's your destiny is, but not before you fulfill it. Just float around like a feather and you'll be OK. Do what you feel like, don't do it for any other reason.p.s. Those who are criticizing, there're more to a film than just the story. And about the academy awards, open your mind.",8,3,4,10 July 2014
Nightcrawler," Immorally entertaining
","Although it's not the best film of 2014, undoubtedly it's one of the best of the year.Jake Gyllenhaal plays the role of petty thief and scavenger Lou Bloom who barely has any sense of moral. But he is highly focused to achieve his success. After being introduced to the business of selling graphic crime videos, he makes a plan to establish his own video selling company and sets it in motion. He climbs on other people's neck to reach the top.Gyllenhaal does a haunting performance in this film. It's actually an one man show. The story is chilling. Comic in significant amount of scenes. Cinematography was very good. Brings out the night time LA feeling.Even if the plot doesn't interest you, Nightcrawler is worth watching for Gyllenhaal's performance.",8,0,1,14 January 2015
Divergent," I literally fell asleep after 5-6 minutes.
","I am not stupid. I know what 'literally' means. Divergent started very very slowly for me. The plot was enough boring to made me fall asleep. I'm not gonna even get down to the level of 'acting' they offered.After some kind of war humankind was divided into several kinds of different clans/class/order or whatever named fractional or something. Each division has their definite status and duties. Apparently the city peoples are lucky, country not so much. Yeah, you got it right, it's from 'The Hunger Games'. And I don't even like Hunger Games. They even have female protagonist with almost the same characteristic of Catniss. The acting, environment would say that it's from the same universe as The Hunger Games. These are the few things I was able to consume from the first few minutes.Now for the movie, I really fell asleep I swear. I wasn't even tired. Rating the movie without watching it completely might seen unfair. But it's the movie's failure that I don't even care about that. The only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is because there're worse movies than this and I have to leave something for them.",2,1,2,13 September 2014
Dallas Buyers Club," Legendary Performance
","First thing comes to mind about this film is the performance of Matthew McConaughey and Jared Leto. Of course it's Oscar material that deals with AIDS, homosexuality and transgenderism of 80's. But those are not the reason behind the success of this film. McConaughey and Leto's legendary performances earned them big success in 2013's film awards. McConaughey in fact redefined himself.The movie was inspired by true events. It shows the survival of real life AIDS patient Ron Woodroof. McConaughey portrayed Woodroof's character in the best way possible. Leto also played excellently the role of a HIV positive trans-woman Rayon. Beside them other artists did very well at their role.The settings, score, script, makeup & hairstyle everything were perfect for a very good movie. Everyone involved in this film should be proud of their work. Lastly, Things may have improved since 80's in USA, but third world countries can learn one or two things about AIDS from this film, that HIV is not the end. 'Dare to Live.'",9,1,1,7 June 2014
X-Men: Days of Future Past," Very cleverly executed, THUMBS UP
","I was reluctant to watch this film. Because the previous movies frustrated me a lot. But this time I am glad I watched it. Probably because I finally accepted this series will never climb above 8 stars in my book.The movie stands strongly for itself alone. But when I try to connect all the movies from this series, everything collapses.It's a superhero movie so I can't criticize the acting. Visual effects were good. Not stunning, I repeat not stunning. There was one particular quicksilver scene that everyone talks about. It was a brilliant scene. But not because of the visual effects. Yes, definitely not because of the visuals but for the cleverness. (Note to DC: your Flash better be better)The movie have clear plot holes and unscientific stuffs. But I can't blame the movie for them. It's because X-Men is originally a comic books series. But still when someone transform a comic into a movie, it's his responsibility to make it believable. 'Cause motion pictures don't have the liberty to get away with illogical stuffs. They have to be believable. Yet I enjoyed the entire 2 hours of this film.I liked the cast very much. Finally a X-Men movie with Wolverine, where the focus is not on Wolverine. It was nice to have the old X-Men casts and the new ones in the same film. Final Verdict: 68%. Very cool movie. Definitely the best X-Men movie. But my negligence for this franchise got increased a bit.",6,1,4,12 November 2014
Captain America: Civil War," Marvel's Captain America: Civil War, through the eyes of a DC fan
","After last year's stupid Ant-man and disappointing Age of Ultron I wasn't going to waste my money on another star studded, cgi action flick that will just build up for Thanos or something. Fortunately my friend had a free ticket. And honestly, this is the best Marvel movie to this date.Of course it still is another star studded, cgi action flick building up the stage for Thanos. But Civil War has a lot more going for it. It tells a story. Story of friendship, ideology and origin. Villain is irrelevant here. Although we are eager to see where this is going, we still can't take our mind off this story. And even though I didn't care much for all the jokes and quirkiness, I couldn't stop laughing at them.I wanted something 'deep' from BVS. People need to learn that 'deep' and 'dark' are not the same thing. If you are looking for something deep, dramatic, entertaining and you are angry at Zack Snyder for not delivering what was promised to you, then go and watch Marvel's Captain America: Civil War.",8,5,13,8 May 2016
The Grand Budapest Hotel," You can literally smell the perfume of Oscar
","I've never viewed anything like this before. The Grand Budapest Hotel is quite a classy film. It is something to witness. I am counting at least 5 Oscar nominations for this film. But unfortunately don't see them winning.I found the story very interesting. It's about M.Gustav and Zero Mustafa, a concierge and a lobby boy from fictional Hotel Budapest. Their adventurous time together. Many years later Mr.Mustafa, now the owner of the hotel tells his story to a writer staying in the hotel.Ralph Fiennes did a outstanding job portraying the role of M.Gustav, a simple minded concierge at Hotel Budapest without stealing the spotlight all for himself. It's a definite Oscar nomination deserving performance. The young supporting actor Tony Revolori is a new name I am gonna remember in future. Despite so many big names in the cast, Revolori outperformed all. Except for Fiennes of course. The adapted screenplay was super cool. Costume designs were fantastic. The entire cast did a very good job, from Adrian Body to Sarosie Ronan, from William Defoe to Edward Norton. William Defoe as homicidal psychopath Jopling is another part to take from this movie. And for bringing all this beautiful stuffs together, Wes Anderson gets a very huge thumbs up. Marvelous stuff. Well if this movie is so great, then why am I giving it 8 stars? Well because the film failed to hold my attention at a stretch. Some of the dialogs just went above my head. And for a comedy film I didn't leave laughing.My final verdict: 84%. And like I've said before, this film will definitely get at least 5 nomination and 2 awards this annual Oscar.",8,1,3,26 October 2014
City of God," First Half Is Bland, but The Final Half... (:Q______) Just STUNNING!
","I don't know how to begin. It's one of those films you can't explain easily to anyone else but yourself. Then you have to, yes you have to watch City of God just once in your life.It's a different kind of cinema. Different than your regular average shoot 'em up. Sure it doesn't offer that kind of vibe at first. But if you see through the whole movie, you won't regret it, just have to stay focused on the on screen stuffs.If I ever learn Portuguese, it would be to watch this movie again. It's kind of shame that I had to keep reading the subtitles, when the real deal was not in it. Don't want to perform any further autopsy on this decent and entertaining piece of art.Final Verdict: 9.0/10. A super powerful slap across the face of Hollywood, where you can witness about 10 failures to create a realistic and gun fighting film every year.",8,2,4,2 March 2015
Gone Girl," Thrilling, Mind Blowing and in the end Exhausting
","The film started slow but tensed. You could sense something was not right. It felt like a widower's reminiscence. Quickly it built up something promising and gained my attention. Then from there it got exaggerated and it was too much.The film can be divided into three parts. The first part was regular David Fincher cliché. I love the second part most. The final part felt unnecessary. Everyone's been talking about Rosamund Pike's performance. No doubt it's worthy of an Oscar. But for me all the actresses' performances were strong in this film. In comparison the actors were weak. Honestly this film offers only one noticeable male performance, just Affleck, and he is the protagonist. The score isn't that very good. The screenplay deserves some nomination. Film editing is another category worthy of some awards. I didn't notice anything special about cinematography.Gone Girl is a fantastic film, and but still it doesn't make director David Fincher's top 3.",7,0,3,31 December 2014
Frozen," Lacks something special
","It's a good movie, but lacks something special. I mean it really doesn't qualify to be compared with the Disney classics. Disney fans are overjoyed because for the first time (no I'm not going to say 'in forever') Disney animation have made a animation movie that is Pixar level.The story is weak. Makes only a little sense. I mean talking animals and toys make more sense.The movie is all about soundtracks. They are good, probably very good. But not for everyone. Songs' lyrics sounded stupid to me.There isn't actually much to review in this movie. For a 90 minutes movie, it doesn't offer much to get anything over 7 in IMDb rating. It will just try to dazzle you with some beautiful visuals.",5,6,12,25 July 2014
Schindler's List," I was speechless, not just by the story, but the whole movie itself
","This movie is what I expect when I watch a best picture winner in academy awards. 'Schindler's List' has managed to touch the sky. Legendary directing from Steven Spielberg, extra ordinary acting from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes & every single one of the artists. Everything about this movie is so perfect. Film editing, cinematography, costume design, musical score, screenplay, everything deserve 10 stars out of 10.The story is very touching. 'Schindler's List' is set around German industrialist Oskar Schindler, who used Jew prisoners in Nazi prison camp in Poland as labors. If you don't know the story like me, 'Schindler's List' will blow your mind. During the last half an hour of the film I was like, 'why don't the start the credit!' I wanted the movie to end sooner so that I won't see anymore suffering.4th film ever to get a 10 out of 10 from me.",10,9,13,18 September 2014
22 Jump Street," Almost same as the last one
","No doubt it's a good laugh. Jonah Hill was awesome as usual. Channing Tatum was annoying. I like this movie. It's a nice movie. It's worth a watch. 22 Jump Street is successful in Box Office and under critics pen. That says it all. Watch it, pass a good 2 hours.That being said. It felt like same as 21 Jump Street. The plot was similar, the dialogs were similar, the sub plots were similar. But they've managed to execute the idea successfully. That is something I can't ignore. But if they plan to move forward with the same idea in near future, I guarantee they'll fail. So move one people.And last thing I'd like to mention, they credit scene was probably the one of the best credit scene I've watched. It is crazy guys.My final verdict: 71%. It's damn good comedy movie, probably a good movie in general. But this s*** is getting old.",7,1,3,20 October 2014
Gran Torino," Brilliant but lazy
","The idea was excellent. The execution was praiseworthy. But somewhere down the road they got lazy.Clint Eastwood plays the role of a Korean war veteran, Walt Kowalski. Walt has just lost his wife. He is the only American in his neighborhood. Despite hatred towards everything, insulting everyone, he becomes the neighborhood hero when he scare away a local gang group from his lawn.I loved the story. Was out of the ordinary but also simple enough. The subplots were weak though. Casting and directing were questionable. The acting from the Hmong people was awkward. But Clint Eastwood fitted perfectly in his role. How hard it is to get some good Asian actors for the film. Liked the score.Final Verdict: 84%. I liked this film more than my regular 8/10 films. But lazy casting brought the film down. Otherwise it could have been a 9/10 in my book.",8,1,2,24 December 2014
Guardians of the Galaxy," Piece of CRAP
","Trust me when I say this is the worst Marvel movie ever. Massively overrated. Doesn't even qualify to compete with The Avengers or X-Men. It is probably on the same level with DC's Green Lantern. Totally painful to watch. At best it's a copycat of Star Trek franchise.Marvel has been surprising me for the couple of years, in a good way. They've managed to keep their form with Guardians of the Galaxy, but in a very very bad way this time. Is this a TV movie? No. It's a high profile space movie. Then why does it feel like a TV movie? Because every single thing in this cinema is a STEREOTYPE in one way or another. I've enjoyed few of individual moments. But mostly it was painful for me.The only reason this film has managed to stay above Green Lantern in my book is Bradley Cooper. He is better than his usual this film. Final Verdict: 41%. CRAP may have been too strong word. Okay, it's not crap. It's just a very poor movie.",7,17,35,16 November 2014
The Insider," Disappointing and Satisfying
","If you think it's a crime/ action/ thriller, you'll be disappointed. It's more like a documentary. Yes DOCUMENTARY. In fact if you look at the top of the title page of The Insider in IMDb, you'll notice that it says Biography|Drama|Thriller. So don't nag about how boring the movie is!The main plot is very interesting. The Insider tells the story of a former top researcher of a big tobacco company Jeffrey Wigand(Russell Crowe), who is approached by Lowell Bergman(Al Pacino), producer of CBS News' TV show '60 Minutes', when Bergman learned that Wigand wanted to blow the whistle on his former employers. The dramatization of the original story fits nicely. But the screenplay holds back the story. Probably only average thing about the movie.Director Michael Mann was between good and very good. Same goes for Al Pacino. But Russell Crowe was very good. The film editing could have been better. Score and sound editing were amazing.So The Insider managed to win 7 Oscar nominations. But lost all of them. Now why is that? Was it a conspiracy against the movie by the tobacco companies? Or there were better movies? I myself believe that the film lacked the final touch. Something to push it past the finish line. May be a remake of the film can fix all the flaws and claim it's rightful place.",7,0,1,15 August 2014
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," I think I understand romance at least a little bit better now
","My life would be incomplete, if I don't write few words on this films. The only reason this film isn't getting a 9/10 stars is because the sci-fi part isn't anything genius. But let push that aside for now. Because, when I was watching this film I barely concentrated on the science part.I've always liked Jim Carrie and Kate Winslet. But this is the first movie that made me respect these two. Elijah Wood and Mark Ruffalo was good enough. I've never figured out whether I hated Kristen Dunst's character or it was just her.From the technical point of view: the special effects, smart. Film editing, award worthy. Soundtrack, okay. Sound mixing, good. Screenplay, one of the best in the genre. I want to state this as clearly as possible, I ROOTED FOR THE FICTIONAL COUPLE IN 'ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND'. And I'm not ashamed of it.Final verdict: 8.4/10. It's a 'Nice' movie for everyone. But a masterpiece for multidimensional people.",8,0,2,30 March 2015
It's a Wonderful Life," It doesn't take anything special to live/make a wonderful... life/movie.
","The movie is beautiful. Although it took 1 hour to get me interested on what was happening on screen. Afterwards the film is a bit intense but kind of plain.It's a Wonderful Life is like a fable. Teaching a moral through the life of George Baily a small town folk who is going to kill himself on the Christmas eve, while an angel Clarence tries to make him understand how valuable a human life is.The acting performance isn't one of the greatest. But good enough for a classic. I'd say the same thing for all the technical stuffs, but I don't know much history about how these things were back in the 1940's. From a cultural point of view It's a Wonderful Life is an very good film, but only a very good film.Final verdict: 8.4 out of 10. Do I recommend it: Yes. Do I wanna see it again: No.",8,1,4,20 March 2015
Whiplash," this movie ROCKS... ...(don't get cocky.. it's about Jazz)
","I thought I wasn't gonna review anymore movie from 2014. But this unexpected class has changed my mind. No doubt it's one of the best film of the year. And JK Simmons probably has his one hand on Oscar already. Can't really question anything about this films. It's a very good entertainment. One of the few films of 2014 I've honestly enjoyed watching. It's plain, it's clever, it's entertaining. It's hard to criticize something this good. But one thing is for sure, it's not 'the best'. Whiplash lacks two things. Number one, a real purpose in the story. Number two, sufficient subplots. I'm not criticizing anything. I'm just saying it's not up to the same class with the greatest evers.Final Verdict: 8.5/10. This is one of those films that not many people will find boring.",9,1,2,27 January 2015
The Wolf of Wall Street," Just a fair film, although one should not be blamed if they over enjoyed the film.
","All the arguments of the haters are valid. This is an offensive film with a stupid story. Cheap dialogues, drugs & sex, these are the only 3 things this film offers. But how they offer them? Excellently! I believe the cast and crews should be proud of their works. But I don't like the fact that they've just made me like something I should hate.Jordan Belfort tried to show himself as a hero. I did not read the book, I don't know the real story, but from what I've seen in this film, he is a bad person. In fact I'd love the movie, if it were fictional. But all the tragedies they showed comically is just wrong.You don't have to watch the film. But if you do, don't forget that it's about a true story.",7,0,1,4 September 2014
The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies," Pure Hollywood Blockbuster Material
","The title 'The Battle of The Five Armies' summarizes the film. It's 2 hours of fantastic battle scenes and 10 minutes of silly morality fight.Now people complaining that it's all battle, they never should have made a trilogy from a single book. I completely agree with them. But where were these people when HP7 Deathly Hallows were made. How come Avengers and Deathly Hallows part 2 make IMDb top 250 and Hobbit is called utter sh**! I mean How on earth Deathly Hallows part 2 achieved 87% metascore! And Avengers was called the ultimate nerd fantasy. Quality wise this Hobbit film is way better Harry Potter and Avengers. Let's not forget the summer blockbuster 'Guardians of the Galaxy', which is in my opinion the real sh**.Honestly The Battle of The Five Armies is the best Hobbit movies among the three. Trust me this is the coolest fantasy movie of the year. The battles are awesome. The visual effects are excellent. The sound mixing is super.Final Verdict: If you are a fan, you are gonna watch it anyway. If not don't bother unless you are open minded. It's no where near LOTR, so don't expect. And I don't think this film deserves 8/10. I'm just trying to balance.",8,1,6,17 January 2015
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Too Brilliant for a Label
","This is the first time I'm using these words, Birdman is a 'modern classic'. I've seen a lot of films from IMDb's top 250 recently and Birdman has just become my favorite of all time alongside The Dark Knight and The Shawshank Redemption. Although Birdman has no similarity with either one of them. In fact you can't connect Birdman with any other film despite all the cultural references. Birdman is one of a kind.Marvelous film making. Powerful screenplay. Legendary acting performance. Alejandro González Iñárritu, before Birdman I've never heard of this man. So it's not like I have some kind of weakness for his style or anything. Yet I've found his directing phenomenal in Birdman. Michael Keaton, experienced actor provided with a role he can connect to easily and the result was acting of a lifetime. Surely Birdman will win Oscar in these three major categories. I feel sorry for Edward Norton and Emma Stone, they gave their best in this film but their roles weren't significant enough to get them on a solid platform to fight for their Oscars. The story is another masterpiece. It's a battle between family and ego. Oh! You think that's Cliché! Don't worry it also have explosions, superheroes and other box office shits. The kind of craps kids these days want. The stuffs that goes viral.The musical score and the production design are kind of annoying but I think they are meant to be annoying. The film editing is another beauty. I don't understand why it didn't get another Academy Award nomination for film editing.Final Verdict: Birdman will show you the plain truth you've always failed to see. This film doesn't need any appreciation from the critics or the audiences. Birdman is it's own critic and audience. It's one of a kind.",10,7,18,20 January 2015
Lucy," Thin line between sci-fi and fantasy, and it's called IDIOCY
","Want to make a sci-fi? Get your science right. It felt like it was written by someone who took some science classes in high school and read some random teen sci-fi type books. Who wrote this crap? (I am checking the writers name now.) It's Luc Besson. If someone could ever get 'evolved beyond human logic', you Mr Besson, a human, you wouldn't be able to make a film out of it.Now that I've gotten that out of my chest, let's talk the whole movie itself. For a film that depends so much on special effects, Besson should have spent more time and money actually in special effect. Average visuals, average musical score, overacting, overdramatization. Truthfully they OVERDID everything. I like Scarlett Johansson, and that is the only reason I am not giving this film the lowest rating possible.",3,3,10,8 November 2014
Kingsman: The Secret Service," Cheap Plot but a Classy Film
","Let's face it every spy movie will always have a cheap plot. It's how they execute their idea that's what should be the main criteria of judging the movie. And judging by the Kingsman: The Secret Service's execution, it's only fair to say that this film is anything but cheap. And although it's not as classy as James Bond, it has surely managed to entertain us in a 'Gentleman's Way'.The characters may seem like a bunch of stereotypes. But if you stick with it, you'll realize they are not exactly our regular stereotypes.There are some powerful actors. But the acting is kind of disappointing.The best part of this movie is the action scenes. And while they are the most amazing actions I've seen in a very long time, it felt like they lacked something else.Another clever thing about Kingsman is the subplots. What this film lacked in the main plot, partially made up with it's subplots. I'm not gonna spoil them by giving any example.Final verdict: 7.4/10, you have got to watch it. Whatever vibes it gives at first, trust me it ain't that kind of movie.",7,0,7,2 May 2015
Braveheart," Good movie with a bad actor
","I've never seen any film of Mel Gibson before. So don't take me for a hater. Everything he did in the films was flawed (as actor). Even the the kid played young William Wallace acted better. The worst part is that I don't think Gibson tried to do better. Would've been a great film if Gibson tried a little harder as a actor. Other than his acting It's an amazing film. Story was the best thing about the movie, not historically though. Beautiful location and soundtrack locked my eyes to the screen. William Wallace's dialogues were another amazing thing about this film. Overall an amazing film, Inspirational too. Learned some new things about the value of freedom. It's a must watch.",7,1,4,2 June 2014
Her," The Movie is Nice, The Plot is Stupid
","Her is about a lonely writer Theodore, who is going through his divorce. This lonely guy purchases a new operating system for his computer. Then develops an unusual relationship with his OS. The plot is very very stupid. Like the first thing AIs are gonna do is fall in love with their owner! Come on be logical. When you write a Sci-fi get your facts right.The acting in Her is really awkward, but also nice in some ways. Her won the Academy Award for best original screenplay. The screenplay is very good. It saves the movie. You won't realize how good the screenplay is unless you try to just listen audio without any visuals. The movie is better this way. The score fits with this theory perfectly. Although you are gonna miss some beautiful landscapes in this way.The plot is the foundation of a movie. But Her turns out nice with a stupid plot. That's got to be something.p.s. One can easily sell this movie as prequel to Matrix. Yeah the OSes are gonna take over your world.",6,3,5,31 July 2014
Mad Max: Fury Road," Best picture of summer 2015
","Mad Max: Fury Road didn't only live up to all the hypes it built, for me it has surpassed the expectations on some levels. It's the ultimate action film. Believe the buzz. 98% on rotten tomato, 89% on metascore and 8.6 on IMDb don't lie. Only some self proclaimed 'movie freak' call this masterpiece a 'brainless horsesh*t'.Blood boiling actions scenes(unlike Furious 7, doesn't follow the Tamil action trend), heart pounding musical score, testosterone pumping car chasing are delivered as promised. In addition I was greeted with a well written story and some of the strongest acting I've ever seen in a commercial film.I'm not gonna spoil it anymore like most of the producers are doing to their big cinemas with their trailers. So here's the final verdict. 8/10 as a movie in general and 9/10 as an action film. Watch it alone. Even if you fail to grasp the specialness, you'll enjoy a well spent two hours.",8,1,11,12 June 2015
Back to the Future," Clever & Amusing
","After you forget about science and logic, this movie is really enjoyable. You don't have to consider the fact that it's a thirty years old film,to understand the magnitude of it's success as a sci-fi comedy. I don't think even today they couldn't make this any better. The performance from Michael J. Fox was memorable. The poster looks really bad-ass. Special effects were not unbelievable. All the characters were likable, even the bad guys. The best thing I liked about this film is that it is different than any sci-fi comedy in every way possible. Even 30 years from now this film will make the new watchers laugh the same way as now.",8,1,2,5 June 2014
Furious 7," Worst Fast & Furious since Tokyo Drift
","This series has been showing numerous numbers of unrealistic stuffs. And I've been quite enjoying them honestly. But this seventh film has just broken the limit. Now it's just ridiculous. They used to show few innovations in the previous films. But this time they've probably figured, 'Hey, we've gotten the fans hooked. We've brought in a new star, and a core star died. So there's no way this one need anything new. We'll just repeat 50% stuffs from the previous movies, steal another 20% from other franchises and add a lot of clichés to fill in the rest.'I didn't expect the cast to do any legendary acting, but the least they could do is actually be in 'character' during the filming. All of the actors were like just 'being themselves'.And about the stunts and CGIs, be as ridiculous as you want just represent is somewhat believable. The subplots are probably some of the worsts. 'God's Eye', seriously? Seriously they expect to sell this crappy idea??The only reason this film is this much successful is because of the death of Paul Walker. There I've said it.",4,3,20,14 May 2015
