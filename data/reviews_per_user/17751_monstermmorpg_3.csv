Conquest 1453," The movie was excellent
","Alright i recently watched the movie. It was extremely good when we thought about the history of Turkish cinema. The visual effects was tremendous and the atmosphere of the movie was so real. The songs, musics were really good and professional along with the sound effects. So i really liked the movie generally. It was close to the Hollywood movies quality.The only negative part of the movie was the spirituality. It has some incorrect information i believe about the spirituality part though the rest of the film is awesome.If you like to watch history movies, war movies definitely watch this movie at the theater.",10,20,58,22 February 2012
This Is the End," Man this movie sucks
",Seriously there were too few funny things. This is comedy movie that is being far away from proper comedy with good sentences.And people doesn't believe in God going heaven wow! After the judgement day started there won't be any more redemption. Because it is all about exam and when you saw the answers it is no more exam.And there is no trinity.There is one and only God almighty creator Allah.Judgement day is real but nothing like this.Too much F word nothing else.I can say this movie is pretty much waste of time.Man i don't know but this is being the more than 1 time i am watching highly rated bad movie.People should really vote based on the quality.There were full of incorrect beliefs and information.,1,4,11,30 October 2013
Cloud Atlas," Not a worthy movie to watch
","I just went to watch today and it totally wasted my time and money Before you go, you are expecting some complex and awesomely related events that you are going to understand at the late of the movie.But you are wrong. The events in the movie is not linked at all. All randomly captured scenes with no aim or meaning. The message being given in the movie is extremely vague and fade.Also it is extremely boring to watch. There were few scenes that contains some cool computer animations and that's all. Also it is a pretty long movie.And it also contains a lot of erotica and only poor movies uses this.So if you value your money and time, not a worth to watch movie.And the only reason i gave 3 star is, it has some battle scenes that contains some cool computer animations.",1,8,20,10 November 2012
