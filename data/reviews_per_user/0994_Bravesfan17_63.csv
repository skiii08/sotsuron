Moneyball," Very well done baseball film
","Moneyball is a very well done film about the game of baseball and the challenges that must be overcome in order to win. The film starts with the Oakland A's in the 2001 ALDS (American League Division Series) against the New York Yankees. The A's blew the lead in the series and end up losing. The most talked about subject in the matter is how the Yankees have a huge payroll while the A's have less than $40 million. Now the A;s have lost their star players (Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen) to teams with bigger wallets. In the offseason, A's GM Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) is talking with his scouts about how they keep talking the same things they have in years past where they are looking for players that are just as good to fill in the voids. After a trade proposal with the Cleveland Indians doesn't work, Beane notices a young man who turns out to know his baseball material named Peter Brant (Jonah Hill). After being impressed by his knowledge, Beane hires Brant to be his assistant. Now it is their mission to find players who are good, competitive, can win games, and be an affordable team to put on the field.Bennett Miller, whose only other film was 2005's Capote, was an excellent choice to direct this film. Miller knew how to keep a consistent pace. He also did well at making there be a light tone at times, but also be serious about the subject matter. Most importantly, Miller's best work was being able to tell a story as he shows us what Beane is going through at work and in his personal life. He is also great at showing what the team goes through in their triumphs and struggles.Brad Pitt's best performance is his role in this film as Billy Beane. Pitt does great at showing how Billy Beane works in his struggles at work and at home as he doesn't get to see his daughter that much. Pitt also is great at showing Billy trying to take his mind off of what is happening on the field. Pitt makes Beane into a well-rounded, likable character and proves that he is one of the best living actors out there.This film also has Jonah Hill's best performance to date as Peter Brant, Billy Beane's assistant. Hill shows that he can do more than play his crazy characters from films like Get Him to the Greek and Superbad. At the same time, Hill is a great comic relief as he helps make the film light in parts. The best part of Hill's performance is how his lines prove that Brant knows what he is talking about.Philip Seymour Hoffman plays A's manager Art Howe. Hoffman does a good job in this role, but it is not as memorable a role compared to Capote or Freddie Miles in The Talented Mr. Ripley. Hoffman makes some good choices as an actor on this role, as he is working again from an Aaron Sorkin script, and knows what the role required.As stated Aaron Sorkin, whose work includes A Few Good Men and The Social Network, was one the writers on this script. Sorkin proved again how he can take material that people might not take seriously, turn it into something exciting, and make what the characters have to say be something important.As a huge baseball fan, this was a treat to watch. If you are not a baseball fan, it is still well worth watching. If you do not know a whole lot about baseball, it is a film that you will find interesting.",10,2,4,23 September 2011
Antz," A brilliant animated film with a great plot
","Dreamworks Animation, who we all know for their commercially successful films, started out with this hilarious film called Antz.Antz leading character is a working ant called Z, voiced by Woody Allen. Allen does excellent work at making Z a very optimistic and self-conscious character, a lot like the many characters he was written and directed himself as over years. Like Allen, Z is very optimistic about how he feels about his life.The film starts with Z talking to a psychologist about how feels that he is just worthless. The film then transitions to Z feeling like he is worthless, but with attitude. We then meet Azteca, voiced by Jennifer Lopez. She is friends with Z but nothing like him. She feels like he needs to relax.At the same time, we are introduced to two other key characters: General Mandible, voiced by Gene Hackman, and Princess Bala, voiced by Sharon Stone. Hackman is just pure excellence in making Mandible to be the sadistic general who wants to see his worker ants wiped out. Bala is a lot like Z in the sense that she is not happy with her life either.Later, Z and Bala by chance meet up at a bar and dance together. When Bala leaves, she thinks that they will never see him again. Z asks for a favor from his friend Weaver, voiced by Sylvester Stallone. Z wants to switch places with Weaver, who is a soldier ant. After Z helps win a war against termites, he finds out about Mandible's mission to wipe out the workers. Z makes it his mission to have his colony break out of its totalitarian ways led by Mandible's tyrant power and to win over Bala's heart.Another great voice performance is Colonel Cutter, voiced by Christopher Walken. Walken is great at being the guy who has to tolerate Mandible for so long until being fed up.The animation is great at showing what life can be like for an individual ant in his culture. The plot is just great at making the story a comedy and showing what one ant can do. There is some mild language, but the language makes the jokes work.",8,1,1,16 May 2011
The Longest Yard," Adam Sandler + Chris Rock + football = Fun movie
","Do not even think about comparing this version to the original from the 70's. This is an Adam Sandler movie, so you know there will be a lot of jokes and dialogue humor, as well as some physical humor. I like the idea of Adam Sandler starring in another football movie.This time around he plays Paul Crewe, a former pro football player famous for point shaving (throwing the game) in a game years prior to the start of the movie. He pulls a crazy drunk driving stunt that lands him in a Texas prison. He is forced by Warden Hazen, played by James Cromwell, to be a consultant for the football team consisting of his guards. Reluctantly, he agrees and is then forced to form a football team of the prisoners.In prison, he meets Caretaker, played by Chris Rock. Rock is brilliant in this part and makes this character his own. Caretaker becomes Paul Crewe's assistant coach.Another supporting player is Nate Scarborough, played by Burt Reynolds. Reynolds is one of two actors from the original who appears in this movie. Scarborough is a former Heisman Trophy winner who wants to coach.There are many other interesting characters. Rapper Nelly plays a running back. Former Dallas Cowboy receiver Michael Irvin plays receiver for the prisoners. Terry Crews is a prisoner who is associated with McDonald's, his character is known as Cheeseburger Eddy. Tracy Morgan plays a cross dressing cheerleader. Former NFL lineman Bob Sapp plays Switowski, a defensive lineman who is not smart but is good at being aggressive.Even some famous wrestlers appear in this movie. Bill Goldberg plays a linebacker for the prisoners. Kevin Nash plays a defensive lineman who has steroids replaced with estrogen. Steve Austin plays a fullback who is racist and arrogant.There is even a brief appearance by Cloris Leachman, who previously worked with Adam Sandler in Spanglish. She plays the warden's secretary who is obsessed with Paul Crewe.This movie is loads of fun and a good modernized version of the original. Director Peter Segal does a good job of taking the original story and making a version that today's audiences can relate to.",8,2,3,21 May 2010
50 First Dates," A great Adam Sandler romantic comedy
","Adam Sandler has done a great job at starring in romantic comedies, and 50 First Dates is no exception. Adam Sandler plays Henry Roth, a veterinarian in Hawaii who has always had flings with female tourists and is always able to get out of it. He has been happy with doing that, working with his animals, and hanging out with his buddy Ulla, played hilariously by Rob Schneider.His life changes when he meets Lucy Whitmore, played by Drew Barrymore. Barrymore is witty and brilliant as Lucy. She knows how to play this character without hamming it up. Henry doesn't know what he's in for when he meets Lucy for the second time and she says that she has never met him. What made Lucy not know Henry is that she had an accident months prior to their first meeting that made her lose her short term memory. Instead of being discouraged, Henry sees it as a challenge to make Lucy fall in love with her every day. For a while, it works.Like most Adam Sandler comedies you will see cameos by his buddies. Allen Covert has the most unfortunate role as Tom, a patient who has a memory that lasts only 10 seconds. Peter Dante plays a receptionist at the mental institute where Lucy visits. Blake Clark appears as Lucy's dad, who thinks Henry is up to no good.Another two funny supporting performances are Sean Astin (aka Rudy and Sam from Lord of the Rings), and Dan Aykroyd as the doctor. Doug, played by Astin, is a workout enthusiast who takes steroids. Aykroyd is great as the doctor who repeatedly helps Lucy understand what happened.This is one of my favorite Adam Sandler movies, and he shows his comic genius. This movie fits easily in the realm of The Wedding Singer, Big Daddy, and Anger Management. Anyone who watches this and expects to see a funny, original Adam Sandler movie will not be disappointed.",8,0,0,21 May 2010
The Hangover," The best movie from director Todd Phillips
","Director Todd Phillips knows how to make a good, original story, and make it his own. With The Hangover, Phillips proves that he does not need famous actors to make a fun comedy that shows to be a good time. Phillips first shows this by having only semi-famous actors play the four main characters.Bradley Cooper, who appears in Wedding Crashers and Yes Man, plays Phil, a married man who takes his buddy out to Las Vegas for a bachelor party. Ed Helms, who is most famous as Andy Bernard from The Office, plays Stu, a dentist who calls himself a doctor. Justin Bartha from the National Treasure movies plays Doug, the man who is getting married. Zach Galifianakis steals the show as Alan, who thinks of Phil, Stu, and Doug as his best friends. Alan says and does the dumbest stuff but Galifianakis pulls it off and makes Alan believable.Many people know who Heather Graham is and she is brilliant as Jade, the stripper who marries Stu while they are wasted. In another brilliant part is Ken Jeong, who plays a mob boss that is angry with the guys. Mike Tyson also makes a hilarious cameo.As the scenes and the story unfold, Phillips puts us with the guys as we try to figure out what happened to the guys and makes us want to know just as badly as the guys do. Phillips decides that we as an audience should try and figure out how and when everything happened. This is some brilliant work by Phillips as he puts us involved in the movie.I also like that the director doesn't just give away the ending. Phillips knows how to make the characters believable and keep the story compelling. This is his best movie to date and he proves that he can get semi-famous actors and make them good.",10,2,4,21 May 2010
Kung Fu Panda," Wonderfully structured movie
","Kung Fu Panda is one of the best films that Dreamworks Animation has put out and still holds up well. Po, voiced by Jack Black, is a panda who is the biggest fan of the Furious Five. He works at his father's noodle restaurant, even though he loves kung fu. On the day the dragon warrior is to be announced, Po does everything in his power to get in to see who the dragon warrior is. However, a surprise happens as Po is selected.Now that Po is to be the dragon warrior, he is one who must defeat an evil snow leopard named Tai Lung. Master Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman, must train Po to do what may have been impossible and put him through rigorous training involving food in order to motivate Po.The Furious Five are all excellent supporting characters. The stand out of them is Tigress, voiced by Angelina Jolie. Jole is excellent at being the uptight, tough one who truly thinks Po does not belong. Ian McShane is also excellent as Tai Lung. McShane brings a real tough intensity to him that shows Tai Lung's true evil spirit.The best part of this film is how directors Mark Osborne and John Stevenon rely mostly on the story. They show that if you have a great story to follow, everything else will fall into place. This film has great dialogue and great transitions from scene to scene.",9,1,1,26 May 2011
Gravity," A Feast for the Eyes from a Visionary Director
","Seven years is too long of a wait for a director to bring out his latest film. That is the case with director Alfonso Cuarón. His most recent outing, Children of Men, came out in 2006. But to this movie fan, it was well worth the wait.Dr. Ryan Stone (Sandra Bullock) is on her first space shuttle mission. She is accompanied by veteran astronaut Matt Kowalski (George Clooney), who is on his last mission. While in space, the astronauts find out about debris being through space destroying anything in its way. The mission is aborted, leaving the shuttle destroyed, and the astronauts stranded in space. While Stone is stranded and freaked out, Kowalski comes to her as they only have 90 minutes until the debris returns around the earth. The two keep trying to contact Mission Control in Houston to no avail. They make it back to the shuttle, to find the remaining crew dead and the shuttle damaged beyond repair. There is a nearby Soyuz that they can make it to nearby. However, that is also damaged beyond repair and the ship used to take astronauts home is also gone. They end up at the International Space Station, thanks to Kowalski's thruster. However, his momentum is pulling them both away. But Kowalski's confidence assures her that she can fly the damaged Soyuz module to a nearby Chinese space station with a landing module based on how the Soyuz is designed.This is a very powerful film with a great story, thanks to the many efforts of visionary director Alfonso Cuarón. His direction keeps the story exciting, entertaining, and makes us wonder what will happen next. The story is simple, yet effective. Cuarón proves that less is more. He does a nice job of combining story and structure. He does some excellent and creative work with the camera and showing us very nice shots of what is happening. Cuarón wrote the screenplay with his son Jonás Cuarón. Together, they wrote a simple script, but show that you don't need a lot of words to make an effective script.Sandra Bullock gives the best performance of her career at the front and center of this film. She does excellent at showing the many emotions of Dr. Ryan Stone. She does a great job at being the newbie who is freaked out, but able to get calm and rely on what she knows and what she can do in order to make it back to Earth safely. As an audience, we feel sympathy for Stone and want her make it back. Bullock shows her will and desire, and more importantly her perseverance as Stone. George Clooney is fun and entertaining in his role as Matt Kowalski. Clooney brings his confidence and zaniness to the role. With this performance, Clooney shows us a guy who knows his stuff and can keep calm in a tough situation.With this story, there are many great technical aspects. The big standout are the visual effects. The visual effects team in this film make us as an audience feel like we are in space with Stone and Kowalski. They also do a very nice job with the efficiency of little things floating in space, and not overdoing with the debris flying. Alfonso Cuarón's longtime director of photography Emmanuel Lubezki does some very beautiful work with the camera, especially with the pans in the continuous shots. Cuarón also edited this, which he collaborated with Mark Sanger. Together, they did a very efficient and compelling job of cutting when necessary and showing us what is important to see in this story. The sound design is also very effective and does a great job at putting together the dialogue of the actors, and hearing the noises of the space stations, and powerful when debris crashes. The other big technical standout is the loud and moving music by composer Steven Price. His score is effective at knowing when things are calm and when trouble is imminent.",10,9,18,1 October 2013
Meet the Parents," A great Ben Stiller comedy
","Ben Stiller has shown throughout the years that he does great at starring in fun comedies, and this is no exception. Stiller stars as Greg Focker, a male nurse who is going to meet his girlfriend's parents for the weekend and ask her father for approval to marry Pam, the aforementioned girlfriend. Stiller creates a character that is hilarious, believable, and one that many can relate to.Robert De Niro steals the show as Jack Byrnes, a former CIA agent who is a nice guy but has strict rules. There are times when he suspects and knows that Greg is up to no good, but is accepting of who Greg is and isn't afraid to say anything. Jack likes to have fun but makes Greg nervous. Nobody can pull off the chemistry better than De Niro and Stiller do in these roles.Teri Polo plays Greg's girlfriend Pam and Blythe Danner plays Jack's wife Dina. They both do fine jobs but are not given a whole lot to do.Director Jay Roach takes an idea of what it'll be like to spend a weekend with a girlfriend's parents and makes an original story out of it. Roach is great at telling funny and heartfelt stories. Roach does an excellent job at getting the performances that he wants and is able to tell a good story.",8,1,3,21 May 2010
Forgetting Sarah Marshall," Jason Segel has a breakthrough performance
","Before I saw this movie when it came out in theaters, I only knew who Jason Segel was from his small part in Knocked Up as one of Seth Rogen's buddies. Segel wrote the screenplay for this movie and stars as Peter Bretter, a musician for a TV show that stars his girlfriend Sarah Marshall (played by Kristen Bell). It starts out with Peter feeling good about himself knowing that he has a stable job and a hot girlfriend. All that changes when Sarah shows up at Peter's apartment to break up with him. This has Peter upset for days. His step-brother (Bill Hader) suggests that he takes a trip. Peter goes to Hawaii to try and get over his breakup, only to find out that Sarah is in Hawaii too. Now Peter really can't get over his breakup and is even more upset when he finds out that Sarah is dating and sleeping with (along with having been sleeping with) British singer Aldous Snow (played hilariously by Russell Brand).Segel does a great job in his first leading role. Bell shows what she can handle playing an unlikeable character. Brand is flat out funny and I see a long career ahead of him. Mila Kunis does a great job playing a sweet hotel receptionist who Peter starts to have a thing for. There are also funny cameos by Frat Pack actors Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill.Segel does a great job at being a screenwriter and director Nicholas Stoller does some good work at translation Segel's script to the screen. I look forward to seeing what else both Segel and Stoller can do.",10,0,5,22 May 2010
"Crazy, Stupid, Love"," This one is really all over the place
","Crazy, Stupid, Love has many good qualities to it, but is also really all over the place. Steve Carell stars in this comedy-drama as Cal, who has been married since he was 17. Julianne Moore plays his wife Emily. One night while Cal and Emily are out to dinner, they talk about what they want. Cal says that he wants a dessert, while Emily says that she wants a divorce. On the drive home, Emily confesses that she slept with another man. Cal becomes too heart broken to care.Meanwhile, their son Robbie admits that he is in love with his babysitter Jessica. However, Jessica refuses to do anything about it other than to tell Robbie to stop.While heart broken and moved away, Cal spends his nights going to a bar upset talking about how his wife cheated on him. This catches the attention of Jacob, a ladies man who knows how to pick up women, played by Ryan Gosling. Jacob takes Cal under his wing and teaches him to change his looks and style and what to say to women in the bar.The film goes through so many crazy twists and turns that directors Glen Ficarra and John Requa can't focus on what parts to focus on and what parts to leave out in the story. While a lot of the twists and turns all come together in the final act, this one felt too much all over the place and couldn't decide if this is a comedy or a drama. The only real flaw to me in this film is the directing job.The acting in this film is great. Steve Carell is a great leading actor and shows that he can carry a film and rocks at being the broken man who finds his way of getting his wife back. Ryan Gosling nails the role of the ladies man who takes the broken man how to move on, even though his game has been a bit lacking. Julianne Moore is great at being the fickle wife who wants a divorce, yet can't stand the guy who she is having an affair with. Marisa Tomei only has a few short scenes, but she rocks them all. Tomei's character Kate is a middle school teacher who Cal picks up in a bar. There is a funny twist about her. Kevin Bacon plays David, the man who Emily had an affair with. Bacon isn't given much to work with, but he does a good job. Emma Stone is also good as Hannah, an up and coming lawyer who Jacob finds himself crushing on.The film is worth watching just for the acting alone. The cast ensemble carries the film through its flawed directing and decent screenplay.",8,2,4,5 August 2011
Happy Gilmore," One of the best of Adam Sandler
","This one of the earliest and best of Adam Sandler as a comedy actor. Adam Sandler stars in the title role as a hockey player who takes up golf. He finds out that his grandma hasn't paid her taxes in years and her house repossessed. Happy is told that he can buy the house for a huge amount of money. He has to put his grandma in a retirement home. Ben Stiller is hilarious in a cameo as Hal, the orderly who works at the retirement home.When he shows the movers how far he can hit a golf ball, he does it for money at a driving range. This causes the attention of Chubbs Peterson, a former professional golf player. Chubbs takes Happy under his wing and teaches him how to play golf.

Madagascar," Fun animated movie for the whole family.
","What would happen if Central Park Zoo animals who are best friends escape and are forced to go to Africa? A fun animated movie.We start out introduced to four best friends in the Central Park Zoo. Alex the Lion (voiced by Ben Stiller) is happy with how his life is. He is visited by thousands of people daily. He gets to have steak for dinner every day. Marty (voiced by Chris Rock) is a zebra who just turned 10 and wants more out of life than putting on a show for people every day. He wonders where the grass is greener. Gloria (voiced by Jada Pinkett Smith) is a hippo who is not afraid to take charge. She is a good friend, but not one to mess with. Melman (voiced by David Schwimmer from Friends) is a giraffe who always finds something wrong with him. He is always taking medicines.The penguins steal the show from the best friends as a group who is up to no good in trying to escape from the zoo and go to Antarctica. They are a funny and original group of characters.Marty sets out to go to Connecticut. Before he gets a chance to get on the train, his friends stop him. They are all caught by the New York police and are put in crates to go to Africa. The penguins hijack the boat and the four friends end up in Madagascar. They learn to adapt to the new environment they are put in.While this movie is fun for the whole family, it does a great job of sending a message about how important friends are and keeping them close.",8,1,1,21 May 2010
"I Love You, Man"," John Hamburg takes an old idea and makes it his own.
","Knowing how original writer-director John Hamburg can be, he trumps his first work of Along Came Polly with I Love You, Man. I had high expectations for this when I saw it in the theater knowing that it is from the writer and director of Along Came Polly and stars Paul Rudd and Jason Segel. With I Love You, Man, Hamburg shows us again how he can take an old idea and make it his own. The idea is in the story of what it can be like for an engaged guy to find a guy to be his best man.Paul Rudd stars as Peter Klaven, the aforementioned guy who gets engaged to his girlfriend Zoe (played by Rashida Jones from Parks and Recreation). Hamburg doesn't beat around the bush with this part of the plot. He starts us out right away with Peter's proposal to Zoe. A huge credit goes to Rudd and Jones for making these two characters believable. Rudd is amazing in what is one of his very few leading roles. Rudd is just right for this part as he makes Peter Klaven an awkward, upfront guy who sometimes says the dumb thing. Jones is also great as she shows what makes Zoe lovable and makes us as an audience love her too. Jones brings a unique kind of sweetness to the character.Peter's journey for guy friends start when his family tells Zoe that Peter has never had a best friends and has always been a girlfriend kind of guy. He lets that go but his motivation to find friends happens when he overhears Zoe and her girlfriends talk about how clingy he might be since he doesn't have a lot of friends.Hamburg does a great job at showing audiences what man-dates are and what they can be like. Where two straight guys hang out and get a beer at a bar or go to a sports match, of things that guys do. It takes an open house that Peter is hosting to find the right guy to be his friend. That is when we meet Sidney Fife (Jason Segel, after his breakout role in Forgetting Sarah Marshall). Sidney is much more relaxed, honest, and is not afraid to tell it like it is. Peter and Sidney become really good friends until Sidney asks for money for an investment that ends up helping Peter's business in selling houses.Writer-director John Hamburg knows how to tell a story and relate it to today's audience. Rudd, Jones, and Segel all give funny and believable performances. This movie is a must see for anyone who likes the work of actors in the Frat Pack. It fits right in with the realm of Tropic Thunder, Knocked Up, and Talladega Nights.",8,2,3,22 May 2010
Superbad," A future comedy classic
","I am not as much of fan of this high school themed movie as I am of Fast Times at Ridgemont High and Ferris Bueller's Day Off, but Superbad does a good job of fitting into the realm of the other two. It is about the end of high school and not knowing what the future will bring. Jonah Hill and Michael Cera star as Seth and Evan, two high school best friends who know that they won't get to see each other in the future after high school. Hill and Cera are believable in these roles and give us characters that we can all relate to. Along with them is a future movie icon who will always be known as McLovin. McLovin gets a fake ID made so that he can buy booze. This movie fits the realm of other great Frat Pack movies being fun for everyone, many laugh out moments, and appearances from familiar faces such as Seth Rogen and Bill Hader. This is a must see for fans of the Frat Pack.",7,0,2,22 May 2010
Just Go with It," Adam Sandler does it again!
","For about a decade and a half now, Adam Sandler has entertained us with many fun comedies from Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, to Mr. Deeds, Anger Management, to the more recent Grown Ups. He has done well with his newest comedy Just Go With It.On his sixth collaboration with director Dennis Dugan, Sandler stars as Danny, a guy who was once hurt by his fiancé. When at a bar, he meets this girl who sees his wedding ring. This prompts him to make up a story of how he has a horrible wife. Since then, he has used that story on many girls and having dozens of no strings attached relations with many girls.At a party, Sandler meets a girl named Palmer (played by Sports Illustrated swimsuit model Brooklyn Decker). Yes, she has very good looks and does a great job with this role showing that she has more than a pretty face and attractive body. After meeting and talking with her, Danny thinks that Palmer may be the one. However, she finds the ring and wants nothing to do with him, until he convinces her that he is getting divorced.That is when Danny's assistant Katherine (Jennifer Aniston) comes in to the picture. This is one of the roles that Aniston is meant to play and she does great as the 'future ex-wife', who is playing the part that Danny wants her to play.As Danny continues to make up lie after lie, the story continues to be funny and interesting as it makes the audience wonder, 'How is Danny going to get out of this mess?'What I found funny in the story is that Danny is not the only one in the movie who is telling lies. At a hotel in Hawaii, Katherine runs into an old sorority sister named Devlin (played by the wonderful Nicole Kidman). Kidman does not have a whole lot of screen time, but she takes great advantage of her time as she great as this smug woman, who Katherine hates and is friends with at the same time. Devlin also tells lies to Katherine about what has gone on in her life.I think what makes this movie fun is the crazy situations that the characters get themselves into as they keep making up lies and playing along. The movies has what you would expect from watching any Adam Sandler movie: Sandler being a goofball, Sandler having a love interest, crazy laugh out loud jokes, and hilarious situations. But what makes this one work is how well put together it is. I really enjoyed the performances by Sandler, Aniston, and Kidman. Dugan shows that he is good at what he does best: making Adam Sandler movies.",8,13,25,11 February 2011
Knocked Up," Apatow makes a funny movie with a good message
","Writer-director Judd Apatow has shown some brilliant work with his directing debut in The 40-Year-Old Virgin. His sophomoric work in Knocked Up trumps that as he shows how much he has progressed as a writer and director. He has shown some great directing in setting up the scene and have us get to know who these characters are and how they change.We start out with Seth Rogen as Ben Stone, a guy who likes to hang out with his buddies, drink beer, and smoke crack. Apatow then shows us Katherine Heigl as Allison Scott, a high achieving E! employee who is moving up in the ranks and is asked to become a reporter. Both of our leads in Rogen and Heigl show us how brilliant they are at playing these polar opposite people. Rogen gives a breakthrough performance that made him famous. Heigl shows that she can do a leading comedic role and I find it hard to believe this role went through dozens of actresses before it landed on Heigl.Ben's friends are a lot like him. They also like to get drunk, stoned, and are a fun-loving bunch. Allison's relatives are a lot like her in the sense that they are responsible.Things come unglued when Ben and his friends are at a club the same night that Allison and her sister Debbie are there. Ben and Allison meet and hit it off. They enjoy a one night stand together and don't see each other for eight weeks. At this time we find out that Allison is pregnant with Ben's child.This causes Ben to take an even greater interest in Allison and make him act more mature. He starts to make a crossover from being a stoner to being a responsible guy. Later, we find out that Ben hasn't been as responsible as we thought when we find out that Ben stashed away the books about going through life when expecting a baby. After a crazy weekend in Vegas, Ben decides to actually be responsible with his life and try to win back Allison. Ben moves out of the house from his buddies, gets a legitimate job, and reads the books so he knows what to expect with Allison. Allison takes him back, gives birth to a baby girl, and moves in with Ben.Writer-director Judd Apatow knows how to make good heartfelt comedies with characters who we as an audience can relate to. I also like that despite the raunchiness and content of his movies, he can send out a good message. With Knocked Up, Apatow shows that any ordinary guy can get a hot girl.",9,0,0,22 May 2010
Blades of Glory," The best of Will Ferrell's sports movies.
","Will Ferrell's best sports movie that he has starred in is Blades of Glory. In this, Ferrell plays an ice skater named Chazz Michael Michaels. Will Ferrell takes the character of Chazz Michael Michaels and makes into a typical Will Ferrell character. He plays it as a funny, arrogant jock who thinks he is the best. Jon Heder plays Jimmy McElroy, an adopted skater who is the exact opposite of Chazz. The two leads make a hilarious duo who are great at playing off of each other.In the supporting cast, are Will Arnett and Amy Poehler as a brother-sister skating duo. They seem like nice people, but they are smug and more cocky than Chazz. Jenna Fischer (Pam from The Office) plays their sister who is forced into doing their dirty deeds. Nick Swardson plays an extremely obsessed fan of Jimmy's.The directors know how to mix the comedy with sports and give the audience a fun time.",9,0,4,22 May 2010
Horrible Bosses," A funny movie that goes into darker grounds
","Nick, Dale, and Kurt are all best friends and have jobs that are not the greatest in the film. In the beginning of the film we are introduced to each of our leading characters and what they go through on a daily basis from their bosses. Nick, played by Jason Bateman, has to follow extreme rules set by his boss Dave Harken, played by Kevin Spacey. In order to get a promotion that he wants, Nick has to do things he doesn't want to do but has to because it's Harken's orders.Next, we are introduced to Dale, played by Charlie Day. Dale is a dentist's assistant. His horrible boss is Dr. Julia Harris, played hilariously by Jennifer Aniston. Julia is a sex fiend who is always hitting on Dale, even though he is engaged to another woman. Dale must play by Julia's rules so that he doesn't lose his relationship with his fiancé or his job. Dale also won't be able to get another job because he is a registered sex offender.Then along comes Kurt, played by Jason Sudeikis. At first, Kurt is happy with his job at a chemical company owned by Jack Pellit, played in a brief role by Donald Sutherland. Not too long in, Jack gets into a car crash and has a heart attack. The company is taken over by Jack's son Bobby, played by Colin Farrell. Bobby is a coke addict and total prick who orders Kurt to fire some employees.All three know that they do not like the fact that they have to deal with their bosses, but feel they have no options but to suck it up. One night while they are drunk, they come up with the idea of killing their bosses. They then hire a guy named Jones, played by Jamie Foxx, to be their consultant on how to kill them. Jones gives them the idea of killing each other's bosses.The story goes into many dark grounds with the idea of killing their bosses, and the story manages to stay funny, thanks to the efforts of director Seth Gordon. Gordon found the ability to keep the humor intact to each scene and keeps the film hilarious and interesting throughout. Gordon also does some great work at making the situations really dark but also shining some light on it.The acting is really good. Bateman, Day, and Sudeikis make a hilarious trio and have great chemistry together. Spacey, Aniston, and Farrell are all hilarious as the title characters, and each have their great moments. Foxx also has a couple of great moments as Jones.",9,1,5,8 July 2011
Elf," A great Christmas movie
","If this movie is not a Christmas classic by now, then it will be. Elf is the story about a human who was raised by elves, who finds out that he is human and goes to New York to find his dad.The story starts off great as Papa Elf (Bob Newhart) is introducing us to who elves are and what they do in their lines of work, such as making shoes, baking cookies, or making toys at Christmas. Then it transitions to when Buddy was a baby at an orphanage who sneaks into Santa's sack while he is eating cookies. Later, Santa (Edward Asner) and his elves find a baby in the bag, who Papa Elf volunteers to raise.The story then focuses on Buddy being raised and trained to work like and elf, even though he can't keep up the pace with the other elves. He later realizes that he is a human and thinks about times when he does not fit. This makes Buddy decide to go to New York and find his dad, played greatly by the very talented James Caan.Will Ferrell stars as the human raised by elves named Buddy. Ferrell is great and shows many talents as a comedian and as an actor. You laugh at times when he is dumb because he does not know better. He also makes you feel for him at other times such as when he meets and likes a coworker named Jovie (Zooey Deschanel).As I said, Caan does a great job at his role as Walter Hobbs. He knows that Buddy is a grown man, but knows that he needs to get to reality, even though he loves Christmas. As for the rest of the supporting cast, Mary Steenburgen does a fine job for her part as Emily, Walter's wife. Daniel Tay does a great job at being very believable as Michael, Buddy's half-brother. You can understand what he's thinking when he first meets Buddy. Deschanel is wonderful as Buddy's love interest, Jovie. What Deschanel does great as Jovie is making her to be this girl who just wants to get through Christmas, yet she changes her ways after meeting Buddy.My favorite supporting players are the aforementioned Edward Asner as Santa and Bob Newhart as Papa Elf. I think so just because I enjoyed watching how great they naturally acted in their parts.The director of the movie is Jon Favreau. What Favreau does best with this movie is great storytelling that is fun for both kids and adults. I am 21 years old and I still enjoy watching this movie every year. Favreau proves how well he works with his cast, and make every part of the movie work and be fun. I enjoy seeing parts, such as Leon the snowman, as that makes me think about all those classic Christmas films like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer.",9,0,1,8 December 2010
Ant-Man," A Fun New Addition to the MCU
","Anyone who knows me knows that I highly enjoy Marvel films, and sing their praises. Since the beginning of the Marvel Cinematic Universe with the first Iron Man in 2008, Marvel has made a hit with me every time. I've enjoyed all eleven installments Marvel has put out, and Ant-Man makes it twelve. The story begins in 1989, where Dr. Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) has quit SHIELD after he finds out that they tried to replicate his shrinking technology. He has been trying to hide it away from everyone ever since. Cut to present day San Francisco, where infamous burglar Scott Lang (Paul Rudd) is getting out of prison and moves in to an apartment with his former cell-mate, Luis (Michael Peña). Scott wants to see his daughter Cassie, but his ex-wife Maggie (Judy Greer) and her fiancé Paxton (Bobby Cannavale) won't let him visit until he can pay child support. He can't hold a job due to his criminal record. To rectify, Luis tells Scott of a job he can pull off. Scott is reluctant because of his desire to stop stealing. He takes the job, which involves stealing from the safe of an old man who is not home, only to find a suit and helmet. As he dons the suit and finds out what it does, he hears a voice as he is being tested right away. Hank is the voice Scott hears. When Scott tries to return the suit, he is arrested and thrown in jail, but his 'lawyer' Hank recruits him to be the new Ant-Man. Scott accepts the job and is needed to stop Darren Cross (Corey Stoll), a former protégé of Hank's who has replicated his shrinking technology and wants to use it for his own personal gain. I was always interested in this project since the announcement that Edgar Wright, director of comedies such as Hot Fuzz and The World's End, was going to direct. I became more interested when reading of the preproduction issues such as Marvel seeing the film one way with Wright seeing it a different way. Peyton Reed, who has directed films such as Bring It On and The Break-Up, stepped in and showed that he can not just do things how Marvel wants it done, but be able to add to it. Reed did a very nice job of mixing the action and comedy, and also combing a comedy film with a heist film. Wright and co-writer Joe Cornish had some nice ideas with the script. With Adam McKay coming on to fix up the script, he knows how to write to Rudd's strengths as an actor. Rudd also did some script polishing with McKay. Paul Rudd has shown in the past that he can be a lead and carry a movie with roles in I Love You, Man, How Do You Know, and Wanderlust. As Scott Lang, Rudd is at his finest with making a criminal likable and showing that he wants to do good. Michael Douglas is just spectacular and elevates the role of the mentor to Scott to someone who is also haunted by his past. Michael Peña is a riot as Scott's best friend. He hilarious with when he tells Scott about the job and again when someone wants to find out about him. Corey Stoll also has some moments as Darren Cross. Everyone else goes from serviceable to decent. The technical achievements are also great. I liked the use of the 1.85: 1 aspect ratio as I felt closer to the action. I thought the visual effects were spectacular, especially the scenes where Scott is ant sized and adapting to being that size. I also like the visuals when Scott is fighting Darren in Cassie's bedroom. The enlarged ant and the enlarged Thomas the Tank Engine cracked me up. I also liked the editing, especially in the two scenes where Luis is telling his story and the characters involved are talking the same way he is. The sound design was all around brilliant and I liked the use of different sounds. This is an overall fun addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Like Guardians of the Galaxy, this has an overall light tone that makes Marvel feel fresh but be part of the overall universe. I enjoyed the mid credits scene and the end scene makes a nice buildup to the next MCU installment.",9,1,8,18 July 2015
American Hustle," An Excellent Goodfellas Vibe, But Something Different
","Wow, filmmaker David O. Russell has come a long way to becoming one of the most popular filmmakers today. Recently having impressed audiences with The Fighter and Silver Linings Playbook, Russell has struck gold a third time in a row with his latest flick, American Hustle.Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) is a man from the Bronx who sports a comb over hairstyle. He works in running cons with his lover Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams). They have been doing successful in conning people to giving them money thanks to Sydney's fake British persona Edith Greensley. Even though they are succeeding, they're lives are complicated by Irving's wife Rosalyn (Jennifer Lawrence) who he refuses to divorce out of fear of not being allowed to see his son. It isn't until FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper) tricks them by being a customer and then arresting Sydney. Feeling attracted to Sydney, Richie will release them on the condition that they help him arrest four other con artists.In order to set this up, Irving has one of his friends pose as an Arab Sheik looking to invest in American business. An associate suggests doing business with Camden, NJ mayor Carmine Polito (Jeremy Renner), who is looking to legalize gambling. David O. Russell's film is one of mystery, craziness, and you don't really know who is conning who until it is all revealed at the end.David O. Russell continue to show his excellence in directing. Russell does just right at pointing the camera at what is important to the story and how what is happening pays off. Another way Russell shows his skill as a story teller is keeping us interested in these characters, who are not really likable.Eric Warren Singer and Russell co-wrote the script, which gives the film a nice Goodfellas vibe. With the majority of their screenplay focused on Irving and Sydney, it gives us a nice insight into what is in it for each of these characters and how they are all developed.Christian Bale does an excellent job leading this ensemble as the con man who wants business. Bale dedicates himself to this performance by having gained weight and giving Irving an interesting looking comb over hairstyle. With this role, Bale shows us a guy who does his best to keep his cool despite what he's going through. Amy Adams is knocks her role out of the park as Bale's co-lead and Irving's lover Sydney Prosser. Adams does some impressive work not just as a con artist tricking people with her British accent, but also keeping us on our toes in making us unsure if she is loyal to Irving or Richie. Bradley Cooper is the best in show here as FBI agent Richie DiMaso. As Richie, Cooper showed us how much he has grown as an actor. I liked the choices Cooper made in showing us how much charge Richie is taking and keeping things in order, while trying to please his unhappy boss. Jennifer Lawrence is a riot as she pulls off the role of a 1970's New York housewife. Lawrence engulfs herself into looking the part to a tee, with the hairstyle and dresses she wears. Lawrence does so by using the mannerisms used then and how she gets nosy into her husband's business. Jeremy Renner does some nice work as the mayor who wants to do what he can to bring business to Camden and be able to get the economy going. I even enjoyed the cameo by Robert De Niro as Victor Tellegio, a mob boss who is also looking to do business in Atlantic City.I also quite enjoyed some of the technical aspects to it. The production design of the film done by Judy Becker was so well done, I felt like I was right there in 1970's New York. The costumes designed by Michael Wilkinson felt authentic to the time period depicted in the film. The soundtrack also had a lot of great tunes that also contributed to the Goodfellas vibe I was getting.",9,2,8,25 December 2013
Rush," Excellent Racing Film That Feels Like an Actual Race
","Being a fan of Ron Howard as a director, I would say his best films are his historical dramas such as Frost/Nixon, A Beautiful Mind, Apollo 13, and Cinderella Man. You can now add his newest film, Rush, into that group.James Hunt (Chris Hemsworth) and Niki Lauda (Daniel Brühl) are both Formula One race car drivers with wealthy backgrounds. Hunt has proved himself to be a hard working and winning driver. Hunt is a Brit who has a habit of vomiting before every race and is a well known drinker and ladies man. Lauda first bought his way in to being a driver in the Formula Three circuit, and is a technical genius who knows what works best for the cars he races. Hunt and Lauda meet after a Formula Three race where both of their cars spin out of control and Hunt eventually wins the race. Immediately, they don't like each other. Both of them go their separate ways, only to meet again when they each join the ranks of Formula One. Hunt lands a deal to race for McLaren, while Lauda buys his way into a team that races Ferrari's. The film's primary focus is on the 1976 season, and shows us what Hunt's and Lauda's lives were like on and off the race track. Hunt is seen as a ladies man, who settles down with Suzy Miller (Olivia Wilde), while Lauda meets Marlene Knaus (Alexandra Maria Lara) at a party she is ditching. Both racers are very competitive of each other, but don't necessarily have hatred toward each other. They do trash talk to each other, and do their best outdo the other.Ron Howard's direction of this story, is crisp, rapid, and makes some nice choices that make Rush a very exciting film. Howard is great at showing us various shots of what's going on and gets very creative with the camera. Howard does a great job at keeping us interested in the lives of James Hunt and Niki Lauda. Howard also gets excellent performances from his cast. Peter Morgan, who previously collaborated with Howard on Frost/Nixon, delivers a fast paced and crisp screenplay. I like how Morgan managed to make the script feel like a race in itself when combining Hunt's and Lauda's stories.The standouts from the cast of Rush are the two leads, Chris Hemsworth and Daniel Brühl. Hemsworth excellently portrays James Hunt as more than a drinker who parties and hooks up with the ladies. Hemsworth makes Hunt to be a man determined to win and is ambitious to be the best. Chris Hemsworth gives the best performance of his young career. Daniel Brühl also gives the best performance of his career. Brühl shows Niki Lauda to be a sophisticated and knowledgeable driver who knows his cars. Brühl is also excellent at showing a man who wants to win, but eventually knows when to stop racing.Rush also has a lot of great technical aesthetics to it. One of them is a lot of very unique shots captured by DP Anthony Dod Mantle. Mantle does best at getting the races shown and things happening in the cars and especially point of view shots from the drivers' eyes. The editing by longtime Howard collaborators Dan Hanley and Mike Hill is fast and well put together to tell the story. The makeup department does an excellent job with making Daniel Brühl look like the real Niki Lauda. The music by Hans Zimmer is fast and electric and makes the races more exciting. The sound department does an excellent job of putting together everything, from the actors' dialogue to the music and the sounds of the cars.",9,4,6,27 September 2013
Kung Fu Panda 2," A wonderful sequel
","I loved the first Kung Fu Panda as it showed that Dreamworks can tell a great story and rely on the story to carry the movie. The same can be said about this wonderful sequel.Jack Black returns as Po, who must now find inner peace in order to master the next phase of kung fu. In order to do that, Po must find out where he came from and who he is. A new villain from Po's past comes into the picture named Lord Shen, a peacock who wants to take over China. Now it is up to Po and the Furious Five to stop Shen and bring peace to the valley again.The actors from the original who return for this film all do great jobs again. Gary Oldman voices Shen, and is great at making a peacock sound like an evil character. I also enjoyed hearing Michelle Yeoh in this film as she voices a soothsayer who says that Po will defeat Lord Shen.As I said, what works best with this film is how director Jennifer Yuh shows that a good structured story will carry the film and make this sequel well worth watching. The best part of the story is that there are new parts of this film that we did not see in this one and make this film exciting to watch.",9,1,5,26 May 2011
Madagascar: Escape 2 Africa," A good sequel to a good original
","The beginning of this movie is great as it shows how Alex the Lion got to becoming a popular attraction at the Central Park Zoo. The transitioning to showing where we last left off with the main characters is also great as we see that they are leaving Madagascar to try and head back to New York. However, the engines fail and Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria, along with Julian and Maurice, end up in Africa. The friends try to adapt to life in Africa while the penguins try to fix the plane by hijacking all of the tour jeeps. Alex runs into his mother and father. His father is voiced brilliantly by the late great Bernie Mac. Marty, Melman, and Gloria run into many of their own kind.This movie is full of fun and some new adventures and schemes from the ever awesome penguins. The directors also do a great job of sending messages about friendships, and having unity. This a movie that is fun for the whole family.",8,2,3,21 May 2010
Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story," John C. Reilly gets a breakout leading role
","For a long time John C. Reilly has been fairly known for playing side characters and supporting roles in movies such as Boogie Nights. Gangs of New York, and an Oscar nominated performance in Chicago. Then he becomes known for doing comedies such as Talladega Nights. Now John C. Reilly had a chance to have a starring role in Walk Hard. He takes advantage of this role as he shows the funny side of doing an imitation of music biopics such as Walk the Line, Ray, and I'm Not There.In a weird way, it is interesting to see a comedy version of a music biopic. Anyone who watches should not take this seriously at all. It is like other spoof movies such as Spaceballs, Airplane!, and Blazing Saddles. It also belongs in with other Frat Pack comedies such as Talladega Nights and Superbad. Producer Judd Apatow has been behind many good, fun comedies.",7,2,3,22 May 2010
We're the Millers," A Hilarious Comedy With a Great Ensemble
","It's amazing to think that nine years ago, director Rawson Marshall Thurber surprised everyone with making a hit film about the sport of dodgeball with the Vince Vaughn and Ben Stiller vehicle Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story. Since then, he hasn't done much worth writing home about until now with the hilarious comedy We're the Millers.David (Jason Sudeikis) is a drug dealer who sells little bits to anyone and uses that as his source of income. Rose (Jennifer Aniston) is a stripper who isn't living an ideal life. They know each other from living in the same apartment building. David and Rose are checking their mail at the same time and as David tries to make conversation, Rose rudely pushes him away. David is later talking to another neighbor, Kenny (Will Poulter), as they notice a young girl (Emma Roberts) being harassed by three older guys who refuse to return her phone. David and Kenny find themselves in a compromising situation where their lives are threatened. As they make a run for it, the bullies chase them down and steal David's backpack that had some important possessions. The next day, David is called by his boss Brad (Ed Helms), who forces him into a job that involves David going to Mexico to retrieve some drugs and bringing them back by Sunday night for $100,000. While talking to Kenny, a dorky family in an RV pulls up to ask directions to the zoo. Even though David is rude to the family, he gets the idea to have a pretend family so they are not suspected. Kenny think of himself as David's friend and is on board. They see Casey (Roberts) around and David hires her to pretend to be his daughter. David then tries to hire Rose to be his pretend wife during the job, who rejects his offer. In order to pull of the look, David shaves his face and gets a token white father hair cut and gives Casey money to pull off looking like a regular daughter and thinks Kenny already looks right for the part. After being evicted from her home, Rose agrees to David's offer. For the remainder of the film, David, Rose, Kenny, and Casey have to act like a family so nobody is suspicious, and through it all, start to be a real family to each other.The film is hilarious and doesn't stop having good jokes, thanks to a script written by Bob Fisher, Steve Faber, Sean Anders, and John Morris. They do a great job of keeping the script funny and raunchy. Yet there are parts in the film where the script is a sense of too many cooks in the kitchen. There are a couple of scenes that are over the top. However, the writers all do great at giving the actors their chance to show what they can do with the parts that were written.From an acting standpoint, this is mostly Jason Sudeikis's show. Sudeikis gives a great character arc of David as a drug dealer who lives for only himself but turns into a guy who proves that he cares about others. Jennifer Aniston is a riot as Rose, a stripper with a heart of gold who learns from others about how to care for other people. Will Poulter is hilarious as Kenny, who is a good kid that needs guidance. Emma Roberts is also fun as the runaway teen who also needs guidance from others and is quick to say the right thing to make the 'Miller' situation work in their favor. Ed Helms had played jerks before and shows why he is good at here as the blackmailing boss. Nick Offerman and Kathryn Hahn are also fun and a bit over the top in their roles as a couple who the Millers run into on the way back home.Rawson Marshall Thurber does a good job as director and keeps the film running smooth. He does great with handling his cast ensemble and guides them to having their moments at acting and being funny. He also does great with making the over the top moments funny and work with the film.",8,51,86,30 July 2013
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Judd Apatow is a brilliant writer & director
","Writer-director Judd Apatow in his directing debut shows a nice heartfelt story with a good message, something that has now become a trademark of his. Steve Carell is in his first leading role as Andy Stitzer, and electronic salesman who has never gotten laid, hence the title. He ends up telling his work buddies (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Romany Malco) and they figure out that he is a virgin. His buddies make it their mission to get Andy laid, while Andy is trying to find the right girl.Andy meets many girls, but none of them seem right. He meets one who is a crazy drunk (played by Apatow's wife Leslie Mann). He meets one at a bookstore who is downright crazy (played by Elizabeth Banks). He meets others who don't seem right. Then he meets Trish (played wonderfully by Catherine Keener). Once Andy starts dating Trish, he feels that she is the right girl for him. Andy then keeps trying to get Trish to have sex with him until a conflict comes up. Instead of just wanting to have sex with Trish, Andy falls in love with her and takes their relationship seriously, when he reveals his love to her the feeling is mutual.Apatow knows how to tell a story and send out a good message, despite the content in language. He shows us that there is no too late or too old to fins love. Carell and Keener are great together and give believable performances. Apatow wrote this script with Carell, and they know how to make every part have a reason to be in the movie.",8,0,1,22 May 2010
Bad Teacher," Raunchy and vulgar, but worth it
","Raunchy, vulgar: Those are just two of the words to describe the movie Bad Teacher. On that note, this movie is still well worth seeing. Cameron Diaz stars in the title role as Elizabeth Halsey, a middle school teacher who really doesn't care about how her students do in school. At the end of a school year, she quits so she can rely on her fiancé to be her sugar daddy. When she comes home to find that he wants nothing to do with her, she has to keep her job in order to support herself. Once Elizabeth is back in school, she could care less about her students. Instead of teaching her students, she just shows movies while she sleeps at her desk. Her motivation is to just have money to get larger breasts so she can attract a guy and turn that guy into her sugar daddy.Elizabeth becomes attracted to the new substitute teacher Scott, played by Justin Timberlake. Timberlake is okay in this role, but he doesn't have any moments where he shines as an actor.While Elizabeth is attracted to Scott, a gym teacher named Russell, played by Jason Segel, is attracted to her. Segel continues to show how great he is as an actor. Segel does really well at making Russell a guy who will not stop until he has Elizabeth's affection.A performance who really stood out to me was right across the hallway from Elizabeth. This was in the form of Lucy Punch as Amy Squirrel, a sassy, overachieving teacher who is always striving to be the best. In the film when Elizabeth's motivations change so that she gets a big bonus, Amy and Elizabeth become rivals. Their rivalry is hilarious on many levels.Director Jake Kasdan knows how to keep the humor intact to the story. He does great at making the story raunchy and vulgar, yet hilarious at the same time. The only flaw to me was that at times the screenplay is all over the place.",8,15,29,25 June 2011
Tropic Thunder," The funniest work from Ben Stiller as an actor, writer, and director
","Ben Stiller is one of my favorite actors out there, and shows some real ambitious work in writing, directing, and producing Tropic Thunder. This movie is not trying to be offensive to anyone. Stiller's movie is making fun of all the different kinds of actors.The opening is hilarious in smart in introducing who all of these characters are. From the commercial for Alpa Chino and his Booty Sweat drink to the fake trailers, Stiller shows us who these characters are.Stiller plays Tugg Speedman, an actor well-known for doing a lot of action movies hoping to show some serious acting work. Stiller is funny in his portrayal as an actor who has hit every high and low point in an acting career. Tugg Speedman is still vying to be a serious actor even after his director Damien Cockburn, played by Steve Coogan, dies from stepping on a land mine.Jack Black is funny as Jeff Portnoy, a well known comedic actor who is trying to show that he is serious. He is funny with some parts, but Black doesn't have that much to do.Robert Downey Jr. steals the show as Kirk Lazarus, a 5 time Oscar winning actor who takes every role he does really seriously. Kirk Lazarus is so serious that he goes through pigment changes to play the platoon's African American sargeant. Downey is brilliant and has the funniest lines including: 'I know who I am. I'm the dude, playing the dude, disguised as another dude.' He is that good that I don't think anyone else could play that role as well as Robert Downey Jr. has.Tom Cruise also steals the show as Les Grossman, a really mean executive producer with the dirtiest mouth ever. Tom Cruise is just flat out hilarious and nobody can do the dances that he does. Cruise shows that he can do some real comedy.There are also some funny characters in Alpa Chino, as the rapper who is trying to make it as an actor, and in Kevin Sandusky, a young aspiring actor who is working with his idols.Stiller is not trying to make fun of anyone other than actors, which is what Tropic Thunder is about. This movie is funny, original, and one of the best that Ben Stiller has done.",10,6,12,21 May 2010
Bridesmaids," A great comedy for girls and guys
","I had been hoping that this would be another great comedy to add to the Apatow group, and my hopes were fulfilled. This time around, producer Judd Apatow has called on director Paul Feig to do a movie with the main characters being women.Kristen Wiig from Saturday Night Live plays Annie, a former baker who has been out of business for a while. Maya Rudolph plays Lillian, Annie's best friend who announces that she is engaged and wants Annie to be her maid of honor. Starting with the engagement party, we are introduced to the other bridesmaids. The one bridesmaid that is mostly focused on is Helen, played by Rose Byrne. The story shifts to Helen trying and succeeding at stealing Annie's power as maid of honor. Every time Annie comes up with an idea on something to do related to the wedding or bridesmaids, Helen tries to outdo her.Most of the focus is on Annie and the fact that she feels like Helen is trying to replace her and be better than her. I think what Wiig does so well in this role is how she makes us feel sympathy for her and want her to find a way out of her slump. I felt like cheering for her and wanted her to fix her life and stand up for herself. One scene I thought Wiig did really well was an outburst scene because she did great at showing her rage without going over the top. This film was a great starring vehicle for Kristen Wiig.Byrne is great at being the snobby, over-achieving Helen. What Byrne does well is being the prissy snob that makes us want to hate her for what she is doing to Annie. At the same time, she is cool because of the strings she is able to pull to get what she wants.Rudolph does some fine work in her part. She is likable at first because she is a good friend. Eventually, she is not there for Annie, and ends up turning on her.I also enjoyed the other bridesmaids in their parts. Ellie Kemper, who plays Erin on The Office, has some great scenes. She plays a young wife who says some stupid things and realizes she hasn't lived. Melissa McCarthy is a riot as Megan, who is smart, crazy, and ends up helping Annie in her time of need. Wendi McLendon-Covey is the other one, who does a fine job. Most of her screen time is her complaining about her home life.The story is a hilarious one. Even though most of the ensemble is women, there are plenty of laughs for the guys as well. Most of the situations in the films are funny for everyone. Don't let the makeup of the main cast fool you. This movie is plenty of funny and is very entertaining.",9,9,20,13 May 2011
Meet the Fockers," A fun sequel, but not as good as the original
","Director Jay Roach starts out by doing a good job at starting us out where we left off with Greg Focker and Pam Byrnes. They go to Pam's parents' house, where they drive on an RV to meet Greg's parents before Greg and Pam get married.Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Teri Polo, Blythe Danner, and Owen Wilson all do fine jobs at reprising their roles from the original. Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand are both hilarious as Stiller's parents.While this is a fun sequel, the work that Roach did in this movie lacked the heart and pacing that the original had. It is worth watching if you are a fan of Ben Stiller and the original. I am looking forward to part 3 that is supposed to be coming out in December.",6,0,0,21 May 2010
Frozen," A Nice New Addition for Disney
","Disney is always known for and loved as a studio with its animated musicals for the whole audience, something for both the kids and adults. Last year, Disney expanded by not doing a musical with Wreck-It Ralph. Now, Disney is back with Frozen, a musical that fits in with Disney classics.The film starts off with Anna and Elsa, two princesses who live in their parents' kingdom. Elsa has the ability to make Winter weather at any time, to which she and her sister have fun with it until her power accidentally hits Anna in the head and knocks her out. As Elsa's power grows stronger, she locks herself away from everyone, including her sister. When the time for her to be named queen, Elsa is afraid of what everyone will see, but keeps herself calm until Anna announces her engagement to Prince Hans, who she has just met. This causes an outrage in Elsa, who walks away in rage, but not without Anna giving her the third degree as to why. Elsa leaves for the North Mountain, and unintentionally causes an eternal winter in her home of Arendelle. When she makes it, she realizes that it's okay to not be afraid of her powers, and builds herself an ice palace (played over with the brilliant number 'Let It Go'). Anna now makes it her mission to find her sister and bring back Summer. On the way, she enlists the help of an ice trader named Kristoff, his reindeer Sven, and an eccentric snowman named Olaf.The cast all does a good job and worked their voices into their characters. Kristen Bell and Idina Menzel do some very nice work as the two princesses, Anna and Elsa. They both do nice of making their characters as great counterparts to one another and pull off their roles as sisters. Jonathan Groff is entertaining as Kristoff, the ice salesman who joins in Anna's quest to bring summer back. Alan Tudyk, who did some excellent work in last year's Disney film, Wreck-It Ralph, is hilarious in his minimal role here as the Duke of Weselton. The real stand out in this film is Josh Gad of Book of Mormon fame as Olaf the snowman. Gad does some brilliant work of making Olaf the comic relief who is always keeping positive and never in the way.The story is loosely based off of Hans Christian Andersen's 'The Snow Queen' and the directors do a nice job of making their own thing, like many Disney movies before it. The animation is nicely done and has some great visuals and shot sequences. In addition to that is a brilliant score by Christophe Beck and some great songs that made for memorable musical numbers, some funny and some serious. 'Let It Go' is the best of all the musical numbers.",8,1,3,2 December 2013
The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," For the Adventurer in All of Us
","Ben Stiller has shown himself to be one of the hardest working and most dedicated actor-directors in today's cinema. He again proves himself here with his latest directed film, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.Stiller stars as the title character. Right away, we see who Walter is as a person. Stiller shows us what Walter's life is like as he is somebody who is conscientious with his money spending, cares about his mother, and lives a lonely life. Walter has begun to set up an account with eHarmony, but cannot come up with anything creative to put in it. But he continues to look at the profile of one Cheryl Melhoff (Kristen Wiig). He tries to send her a wink on the site, but it doesn't work. Walter then enlists the help of an eHarmony employee named Todd (Patton Oswalt), but still can't provide him with much information. At the same time, Walter has a habit of zoning out at various times during his day and ends up missing out on a lot, as he is one who can use lessons from Ferris Bueller.We then see Walter show up for work at Life magazine, where he looks at the negatives for photos. When he arrives to work at the beginning of the film, he finds out that the current issue will be the last one publish and Walter has to look at the latest negatives sent in by photographer Sean O'Connell (Sean Penn). Walter gets a message from Sean saying that negative #25 of the bunch is the best of the set and thinks that one should be the final cover. Trouble brews when Walter looks at the negative and notices 25 is gone. This prompts Walter to go out into the world more and look for clues to find Sean and retrieve the missing negative.Ben Stiller's previous two directorial efforts, Zoolander and Tropic Thunder, were both entertaining with a lot of slapstick humor. With The Secret Life of Walter Mitty, Stiller as a director toned down the slapstick, but still has plenty of humor in the film and does a nice job of putting heart into the story. Stiller also makes some great choices in making us know when Walter is zoning out and making us interested in figuring out the clues too. I also highly enjoyed how Stiller put in the message of going out there, living life, and showing what can be accomplished. Stiller has made a film here for the adventurer in all of us.Stiller even does an excellent job of carrying this film on his shoulders as the lead actor. Stiller is great at making us like Walter and want him to succeed on his quest. The strongest part of Stiller's performance is that he makes Walter an ordinary guy who we can relate to. The entire ensemble does their part too. Kristen Wiig plays Cheryl, Walter's love interest. Wiig does a nice job of being Walter's motivation to go out there and do what he would not think about doing. Adam Scott plays Ted, Walter's new boss. Scott has shown before his capability of playing jerks like he did in Step Brothers, and brings that same kind of nastiness to his character here. Patton Oswalt is hilarious in his cameo as Todd, the eHarmony employee. Kathryn Hahn has a brief part as Walter's sister. Shirley MacLaine was also fun to see appear here as Walter's mother who gives him even more motivation and support. Sean Penn was the best of the supporting cast as the famed photographer Sean O'Connell. Penn has a great scene with Walter with a great monologue.Steve Conrad wrote the screenplay based off of the short story and does a nice job of making the blueprints to this story about an ordinary man who does some amazing things. The cinematography by Stuart Dryburgh is very breathtaking. His capturing of the scenery made we want to go out there and see it for myself in person. There is also some inspiring music by longtime Ben Stiller collaborator Theodore Shapiro.",9,2,5,29 December 2013
Guardians of the Galaxy," Marvel Continues Its Excellence in Filmmaking
","Wow, just wow! Marvel Studios keeps churning these films that keep making superhero movies to be among my favorite types of films. Marvel has now added to that again here with one that I had a blast watching, Guardians of the Galaxy.In 1988, young Peter Quill is living on Earth and his mother passes away. He runs off but is abducted and then raised by Yondu (Michael Rooker) and his Ravagers. 26 years later, Peter (Chris Pratt) is now traveling around the galaxy, stealing things, living life, and prefers to be called Star Lord, until he steals an artifact and is stopped by Korath (Djimon Hounsou). Although he escapes, Korath calls on Gamora (Zoe Saldana) to retrieve the device. When Star Lord, tries to sell it, he is ambushed by Gamora and a fight ensues. This attract a pair of bounty hunters, Rocket Raccoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) and a tree-like humanoid named Groot (voiced by Vin Diesel). However, they are all stopped and imprisoned together. While in prison, the four meet Drax (Dave Bautista), who first wants to kill Gamora for her association with Ronan (Lee Pace), who killed his family. Star Lord convinces Drax that is not the case as Gamora has betrayed Ronan. The five all team up as they are wanted for the orb they have.James Gunn direct and co-wrote this film and has done a spectacular job. Gunn has done a great job of telling us a story, showing us who these characters are, and keeping us interested in what is going to happen next. Gunn and his co-writer Nicole Perlman have done some great work at giving us this story of a group of heroes, but different from The Avengers.Chris Pratt hugely stands out in this film as Peter Quill/Star Lord. While I have highly enjoyed his roles from Parks and Recreation, The Five Year Engagement, and Delivery Man, he shows a completely new side to his acting with this role. Here, we are not seeing the hilarious slacker or best friend like those other roles. With this part, Pratt shows that he can carry a film and shows that he can have a dramatic side too. The next standout surprisingly to me was Dave Bautista as Drax, the big muscular prisoner who joins the Guardians to first avenge his family, but becomes a respected member. Zoe Saldana is great as Gamora, who antagonizes at first, but joins Peter's Side. Bradley Cooper is a riot in his part voicing Rocket Raccoon. I also enjoyed Michael Rooker as Yondu, who seems to want to murder Peter. I also enjoyed seeing Benicio Del Toro, John C. Reilly, and Glenn Close in each of their brief roles.On the technical side, there are so many spectacular things to praise. First to stand out is the visual effects in this film. Next is the production design as it shows a lot of creativity and many interesting set pieces. The makeup is very well done. I also enjoyed the cinematography by Ben Davis, and the music by Tyler Bates.I had a fun time watching this film, and would be happy to see it in theaters again. Marvel continues to show their excellence not just in superhero films, but films overall.",10,3,7,1 August 2014
Shrek 2," A great sequel
","Back in 2004, Dreamworks did an excellent job of giving people what they were wanting to see: another Shrek adventure on the big screen. I liked how the films starts with another storybook opening with Prince Charming going out to find the famous princess, locked in the highest room of the tallest tower. I also liked how the film puts the joke on Charming and the audience with Charming finding out the princess is on her honeymoon.We then pick up where we first left off in the original with Shrek and Fiona being newlyweds happily getting home. We find that Donkey never left and wants to hang out with Shrek and Fiona, even though he has a love in his life in the dragon who once guarded Fiona. We then find that Shrek's life is interrupted as soldiers from the kingdom of Far Far Away have summoned Shrek and Fiona to come to Far Far Away to receive a blessing from Fiona's parents, who are the king and queen.Shrek unwillingly goes, and Far Far Away is great at being a spoof on Hollywood. Problems arise when King Harold does not approve of Fiona marrying an ogre and everyone has a fight over what Fiona's parents did to her and how everyone is behaving. This summons Harold to pay someone to murder Shrek. Not too long after, we are introduced to the Fairy Godmother, who has the ability to grant wishes to those who want a happily ever after. Before going to bed, Harold invites Shrek to go on a morning hunt, even though it is intended to be a trap.This is where we are introduced to a new character, Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas. Banderas is brilliant at bringing that mysteriousness and genius to Puss and how daring he can be. Quickly after, Shrek immediately starts liking Puss while Donkey feels a bit threatened.Now we are on a puzzle to find out why Harold doesn't like Shrek and not want him to be with Fiona. It is now Shrek, Donkey, and newcomer Puss in Boots on a whole new adventure. The laughs continue and the story continues to be exciting as there are more layers to be peeled. This sequel has done well of being up there with the original in terms of quality.",8,0,1,16 May 2011
The Hangover Part II," A lot like the original, but well worth it
","Todd Phillip's sequel to his successfully original The Hangover has a lot of the same situations as the first. That being said, it is still well worth going to see.The Hangover Part II starts off the same way. Phil is on the phone with Doug's wife Tracy and tells her that they will not be able to do the wedding. This time around it's Stu who is getting married in Thailand. While still in Los Angeles, Stu decides that their breakfast at an IHOP is going to be his bachelor party because he does not a repeat of what happened in Vegas. Since Stu's announcement of his plan to marry his new girlfriend Lauren, Alan has been hoping to get an invite, but to no avail. Stu reluctantly invites Alan.Two days before the big wedding, Lauren's father has shown that he hates Stu. Alan feels intimidated about Lauren's brother Teddy, who Alan feels will steal his friends. They each have one beer before all hell breaks loose in Bangkok.Again, we have a situation in Bangkok just like in Vegas. The guys went through a crazy night taking on Bangkok and do not remember what they did. Now it's up to them to figure out what they did and to find Teddy, who is the one that went missing.If you love the original, this one is still just as entertaining. There are hilarious situations involving Stu's Mike Tyson tattoo, a drug dealing monkey, a monk, and Mr. Chow.Bradley Cooper has made Phil into a much stronger leader in this one. While he was great in the first film, he shows how well he works with his friends. Ed Helms has also made Stu into a much stronger character. Helms makes Stu excellent at his ability to not be afraid of showing how he feels. Zach Galifianakis again makes Alan to be one of the craziest and most unique people out there. The three show that they have great chemistry as they walk through the streets of Bangkok.In a brief but awesome supporting role, Paul Giamatti shows up in the film as an INTERPOL agent disguised as a mob boss who is after Mr. Chow. Giamatti proves his excellence in whatever role he is given. At first, I really believed that he could be a mob boss.I also enjoyed seeing Mike Tyson return at the end of the movie for another awesome cameo. What I like best about this film is how director Todd Phillips makes this film a similar story to the first one, but set in another city, with some different situations. Phillips has done well at making a true sequel. I am looking forward to whatever movie Mr. Phillips has coming out next.",8,3,11,26 May 2011
Prisoners," A Very Dark and Chilling Thriller That Is Well Worth It
","I went and saw this new thriller from director Denis Villenueve. A lot of different things about it made me interested despite the fact that I haven't seen the director's other films on his resumé.Prisoners begins with Keller and Grace Dover (Hugh Jackman and Maria Bello), who live in the small town in Pennsylvania. They are taking their son and daughter to visit the Birch family headed by Franklin and Nancy (Terrence Howard and Viola Davis) for Thanksgiving. While there, the youngest daughters, Anna and Joy, go around the neighborhood and mess around on an RV, before their siblings make them stop. Later, Anna and Joy go outside again and don't return, which causes immediate panic for the Dovers and Birches. At the same time, Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) is eating alone at a Chinese restaurant when he gets a call about a suspicious RV at a nearby rest stop. Loki takes the call and other cops show up. The driver of the RV is Alex Jones (Paul Dano) and he is immediately a suspect in kidnapping Anna and Joy. Loki does not play around when interrogating Alex as he thinks Alex is guilty. However, the RV is clean in the sense that there is no evidence to arrest Alex. Alex is let go, and Keller is not happy about this as he also strongly believes Alex to be guilty. Keller does everything he can to track down the girls. Grace is worried sick for her girl, literally. The Birches are also very worried. Loki must do everything in his power to track the girls' kidnapper and safely have them returned home before its too late.Denis Villenueve does an excellent job with handling this dramatic and chilling material. He created some powerful and emotional scenes with the shot lists he has put together. Villenueve has does a nice job at keeping the story moving forward while making this very emotional for the audience. Aaron Guzikowski wrote the screenplay here, and does a nice job of writing a dark, gritty, chilling script. Guzikowski does a nice job at making some plot twists I was not expecting. The only fault I point out on Denis Villenueve and Aaron Guzikowski is the ending is iffy, but the film overall is very well done thanks to the director and writer.Jake Gyllenhaal gives a very powerful performance as Detective Loki. He does a great job at showing a man who cares about the job at hand and will do anything to solve this case and have the girls safely returned home. Loki is a hard worker and Gyllenhall gives the best performance of his career. Hugh Jackman also does great work as Keller Dover. With this role, Jackman is very raw and emotional as a religious man and loving father who will also stop at nothing until his daughter is home safe and sound. Jackman gives one of the best performances in his career in this film.Of the supporting cast, Maria Bello is the standout as the worried, sick mother literally. Despite having limited screen time, Bello makes the most of her role as she is told by her husband to stay home and get better. She is even suspicious when some unusual activity happens in her house that makes her wonder if it's Anna. Terrence Howard and Viola Davis do some nice and emotional work here as the Birches. Howard has a bit more to do than Davis, but does great job at acting with his facial expressions. A surprising performance to me was Melissa Leo as Alex Jones's aunt. She is great at playing like nothing's wrong, despite her nephew being highly accused of being a kidnapper. Paul Dano even does a surprising job as the guy suspected of kidnapping and is good at playing the dumb guy who doesn't know what anyone is talking about.From a technical aspect, the best is the camera work by DP Roger Deakins. Deakins really is the best DP out there and knows very well how to get the shots his directors want and his brilliant use of lighting. I also quite enjoyed the editing by longtime Clint Eastwood collaborators Joel Cox and Gary Roach. I even thought the production design by Patrice Vermette.",9,5,12,20 September 2013
For Love of the Game," What goes on in a pitcher's mind as he is in the game?
","Sam Raimi, who is probably most famous for the Spider-Man films and the Evil Dead films, shows that he can do more than action and horror films with the baseball drama For Love of the Game. He proves that he is a good storyteller.Kevin Costner stars as Billy Chapel, a pitcher in the nineteenth season of his career, all of it spent with the Detroit Tigers. He is in New York to play the Yankees in a series in what may be the last game of his career.As he is playing at Yankee Stadium, at many times on and off the pitcher's mound, Chapel flashes back to many moments in his past. The majority of these flashbacks involve Jane Aubrey, Chapel's on-again and off-again girlfriend, played by Kelly Preston. She is a magazine writer who gets offered a job in London. Unfortunately for Billy, her plane leaves for London during his game.The best parts of this story is the mix of the current game Billy is in and the flashbacks he has. Not sure what he has ahead of him, he is making history with this game against the Yankees.Costner gives a rich performance as Billy Chapel. To me, his character as a baseball player makes me think of pitchers like Greg Maddux, Tom Glavine, John Smoltz, Randy Johnson, and Pedro Martinez, all of who I watched pitch when I was a kid. When he is not playing, he does great at taking his memories and later using them in the game. The biggest part of Costner's performance is on thinking about if he should try to keep playing, hanging up his cleats, or go after the woman he loves.Preston also gives a great performance here as Aubrey. She does a good job of showing Jane as an independent woman, yet also trying to keep a stable relationship with Billy when they are dating. It may seem like the typical girlfriend role, but she is there to support him at his low points and high points of his career.Also giving a great supporting turn in this film is John C. Reilly as Billy's catcher, Gus Sinski. Both on and off the field, Gus is always looking after Billy, and saying that he's got his back. On what seems like a small role, Reilly knocks it out of the park at being the guy Billy can always turn to, even when he's drunk.If you enjoy baseball films, this is well worth it. I like to think of this, Field of Dreams, and Bull Durham as a trilogy, even though the only things they have in common are that they are baseball films starring Kevin Costner. If you are not a baseball fan, you should still check this out because it is more than a baseball film.",8,0,1,9 January 2012
Puss in Boots," A rip roaring good time.
","I went into this film, wanting to see it but with mild expectations. The director of this film is Chris Miller, whose most recent film as a director was Shrek the Third, which I thought was the worst one of that series. He has redeemed himself here. Something I noticed on this film was that Miller relied more on the story in the film, rather than put in too many pop culture references.Antonio Banderas comes back from the Shrek series to voice Puss in Boots, once again. Banderas shows that there is no other actor who can voice this cat. In his own film, Banderas makes Puss into a much more lovable character. In the story, Puss is an outlaw in his hometown of San Ricardo. If seen, he will be arrested and put behind bars indefinitely. He has a mission to find magic beans.Immediately, he has an unknown rival who is also after the same magic beans. After a long series of chasing and fighting, we find out that it is Kitty Soft Paws, voiced by Salma Hayek. Hayek does great a voicing this sassy cat with no claws, and can steal from one without that one realizing it.It turns out that she was working with an old friend turned nemesis of Puss named Humpty Alexander Dumpty, voiced by Zach Galifianakis. Zach does an excellent job of becoming this socially awkward egg, who needs Puss for a job involving the magic beans. However, Humpty has a secret of his own.These magic beans are heavily guarded by a husband and wife bandit couple named Jack and Jill, who are voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. They are after the same thing Puss and Humpty are after, and want the rewards all to themselves. Thornton does a bit of a mix of his own regular voice and the voice he used when he was Karl Childers in his film Sling Blade. Sedaris made Jill sound like an angry hick.The story is fun as it is about who Puss in Boots was before he met Shrek and Donkey. The five main characters were all well developed and well played. The visuals in this film are stunning. The animation was spectacular as the scenery is amazing. The music is great as it feels part spaghetti western, part modern day swashbuckling tale.As for a family film. the kids will enjoy it. The parents will be able to sit through it and enjoy a good story for themselves. Even those who are not kids or parents, like myself, will enjoy watching this film.",8,14,19,29 October 2011
Elysium," A Great Sophomoric Effort from Neill Blomkamp
","Director Neill Blomkamp set the world on fire in 2009 with his surprise sci-fi box office hit District 9, which would later collect four Oscar nominations including Best Picture. Now in 2013, Blomkamp has returned with a new sci-fi film, Elysium, with names people know, including Matt Damon and Jodie Foster.Elysium's exposition shows us that in the late 21st century, Earth has become overpopulated and terrible to the point where only the rich can go to a fancy space station called Elysium, where they also have Med-Pods that cure people almost instantly. The film then focuses on Max (Matt Damon), an ex-con who lives in an overpopulated and devastated Los Angeles. Max works for Armadyne, the company who provides robots and weapons to Elysium. On his way to work, Max is stopped by robot police officers and an altercation results in a broken arm. While at the rundown hospital in Los Angeles, Max reconnects with a childhood friend, Frey (Alice Braga), who has a daughter dying from leukemia.When some ships try to illegally bring Earth citizens to Elysium, Secretary of Defense Delacourt (Jodie Foster) orders sleeper agent Kruger (Sharlto Copley) to shoot down the ships as they return. Shortly after, the president yells at Delacourt and fires Kruger. Delacourt is out to be sure that Elysium is protected and her integrity is intact. Delacourt then convinces billionaire John Carlyle (William Fichtner) to write a program that will make her president and in return, Elysium's contract with Armadyne is renewed for 200 more years. Carlyle does so, and keeps it in his head (literally) until he returns to Elysium.After Max is forced into a task he doesn't wish to do, he exposed to a deadly level of radiation and is told he only has five days left to live. Max then seeks the help of Spider (Wagner Moura) to get him to a Med-Pod. The film then primarily is about Max's mission to make it to Elysium to be saved and make things right.Neill Blomkamp shows his excellence as a storyteller and shows his expertise in the sci-fi genre. He knows how to keep the story interesting and as a writer, knew how to keep the story flowing. Blomkamp shows that he is a directing talent to be kept an eye on for a long time, and I look forward to whatever he makes next. If I had to pick between Blomkamp's two films, I still pick District 9.Matt Damon as the lead in this film shows why he is one of today's best leading men. While Max is not as much of a stretch compared to other roles he has done, it shows that Damon can still lead the film, and works great with his on screen partners. Jodie Foster is quite different in her role as the ruthless Delacourt, who will stop at nothing to keep Elysium entitled to only the rich. She shows that she is still one of the best living actresses. Sharlto Copley is the MVP as Kruger the bounty hunter. I loved how I had no idea what Kruger was going to do next, thanks to Copley's menacing take on the character.From a technical standpoint, there are many great things about Elysium. DP Trent Opaloch does some very nice camera work here. The editing by Julian Clarke and Lee Smith is exciting and does great at keeping a nice pace. I think the best of all the technical aesthetics was the production design by Philip Ivey.",9,3,6,23 August 2013
There's Something About Mary," One of the funniest movies from the Farrelly Brothers
","The Farrelly Brothers have always been known to direct funny movies ranging from Dumb and Dumber to Stuck on You to The Heartbreak Kid. One of their best and funniest works is There's Something About Mary. Ben Stiller plays Ted, a romantic who has thing for a girl named Mary, played by Cameron Diaz. Mary is a girl who Ted used to date. Ted gets a chance to be with her again as Ted hires a sleazebag investigator, played by Matt Dillon, to track her down for him.However, Pat, the investigator, starts to fall for Mary and gives false information to Ted to keep him away from her. There is some raunchiness in the movie, but the Farrelly Brothers know how to have the raunchiness make sense. As the scenes unfold, the laughs come and the Farrelly Brothers keep us interested and make us want to cheer for Ted and Mary.",7,0,1,21 May 2010
Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny," JB and KG rock
","While this movie is not as funny as Rob Reiner's This Is Spinal Tap, The Pick of Destiny is a funny look into a fictional version of how Jack Black and Kyle Gass formed Tenacious D.JB and KG play themselves easily as guys who write improvised and original songs. They wonder how all of the bands they idolize rock and they find the same guitar pick in many pictures. JB and KG find out from a music store employee, in a cameo by Ben Stiller, that the pick is called the Pick of Destiny.JB and KG make it their mission to find this pick so that they can play awesome music.There are also cameos by Amy Poehler, Tim Robbins, and John C. Reilly. The movie is full of laughs through the situations that JB and KG go through. It is also more raunchy and inappropriate as Spinal Tap, but still worth a look.",7,1,2,21 May 2010
Wedding Crashers," One of the best comedies ever made
","Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn are one of the best comedy duos in the history of comedies, and they prove it here. They star as John Beckwith and Jeremy Grey, two divorce mediators who like to spend their time crashing weddings and meeting girls. Wilson and Vaughn show us that they are the best in crashing weddings and becoming the life of the party. They also show that they are the best in getting away with what they do after meeting girls. Wilson and Vaughn take these two characters and make them their own.Director David Dobkin shows us his brilliance and originality in this story and what can happen when they become attached to one wedding that they crash. Dobkin knows how to play the scenes for laughs and give the viewers a fun movie to watch. He also makes us want to enjoy ourselves and become attached to the story.Vaughn becomes attached to one sister of a bride and Wilson becomes attached to another sister. Isla Fisher and Rachel McAdams play the said sisters. Fisher stands out in making Gloria her own. Fisher makes us like Gloria, yet find her incredibly crazy. McAdams does a fine job in her role as Claire, but she isn't given a whole lot to do. McAdams does a good job in making us want to know more about Claire like John does.David Dobkin does a great job with this movie and shows us brilliance when working with two of the best comedy actors out there, having worked with each of them before this movie. Dobkin directed Wilson in Shanghai Knights and Vaughn in Clay Pigeons.This is among some of the best comedies ever made. It is well worth spending two hours on watching if you are a fan of Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn, or any other Frat Pack comedies.",9,2,3,26 May 2010
The Wolf of Wall Street," For Martin Scorsese Fans
","Needless to say, but Martin Scorsese is one of the best living directors, and has kept the consistency. He has brought us classics such as Taxi Driver and Raging Bull to Goodfellas, Gangs of New York, and my favorite, The Departed. But now Mr. Scorsese has brought us another great film that is a must see for all Scorsese fans, The Wolf of Wall Street.With this film, Scorsese is collaborating with star Leonardo DiCaprio for the fifth time. Here, DiCaprio stars as Jordan Belfort, a Wall Street stock broker who never knew when to say quit. The film begins with him starting out at a Wall Street firm manning phones. Shortly after beginning work, his boss Mark Hanna (Matthew McConaughey) takes him out for lunch and coaches him on how to survive on Wall Street by recommending to Jordan to take up his lifestyle of drugs and prostitutes. After a the firm goes out of business, Jordan's wife Teresa (Christin Milioti) finds a job in the want ads that will fit him. His new boss Dwayne (Spike Jonze) gives him new information about the stocks his place sells and offers an unusual reward if he sells ten thousand dollars worth of stock. Jordan's selling strategy hugely impresses all of his coworkers and earns him a fortune.At a diner, Jordan meets Donnie Azoff (Jonah Hill), a salesman who coincidentally is a neighbor of Jordan's who wants in on his business. Shortly after, they have their own firm and recruit some of Jordan's old coworkers to join in. Standing out among them is Jordan's friend Brad (Jon Bernthal), who also deals drugs. However, the firm has become wild and crazy, which causes Jordan to hire his dad Max (Rob Reiner) to handle the finances. Jordan also throws many wild and crazy parties involving drugs and sex. At one of his parties, Jordan meets Naomi (Margot Robbie), and they hit it off leading to a divorce from Teresa and a new marriage to Naomi. Jordan's actions lead to an investigation of him and his firm Stratton Oakmont by FBI agent Patrick Denham (Kyle Chandler).In the three hour run time Martin Scorsese has put on this film, he gives his audience a wild and crazy ride through the life of Jordan Belfort. As a storyteller, Scorsese doesn't hold anything back. He is not afraid to show us the sex these characters have or have us witness these people doing drugs. I do think that some parts of the film could have been trimmed down, but Scorsese keeps everything in that is important to Jordan's story. The times does fly by quickly. Terence Winter wrote the script and does a great job of making the story run smoothly. Winter does a great job at writing out the dialogue for each of the characters, but the cast also does excellent at bringing Winter's script to life.Leonardo DiCaprio continues to show why he keeps starring in Scorsese's films, and shows a lot of greatness here as Jordan Belfort. With this role, DiCaprio brings confidence, craziness, determination, and a lot more. DiCaprio fleshes out this character and makes him into somebody who is living his dream, but doesn't know when to say quit. The rest of the cast is great too. I truly enjoyed Margot Robbie as Jordan's second wife Naomi. She takes this role of the wife and makes her into a strong and attractive who knows how to stand up to her husband. Rob Reiner is great as Jordan's dad Max who is there for his son and goes nuts at times but can turn the craziness off at the right time. Jon Bernthal is also great as Jordan's drug dealing friend Brad. Jonah Hill is good as Jordan's right hand man Donnie Azoff, but excessively over the top. The standout of the supporting cast is Kyle Chandler as FBI agent Patrick Denham. Chandler is excellent as the agent who was assigned to the case. With his scenes, Chandler makes some great acting choices with his eyes that indicate Denham's intelligence.Like all of Scorsese's films, there are some great things that stand out technically too. The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is nice with the lighting in each scene. Thelma Schoonmaker, who has been editing Scorsese's films since Raging Bull, does a lot of great work with making each scene dramatic or exciting and putting the whole thing together.While I highly enjoyed The Wolf of Wall Street, I must say that this is not for everyone. I recommend this for Martin Scorsese fans and those who enjoy great acting.",9,0,5,31 December 2013
Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy," Dumb, has its moments
","I enjoy most of Will Ferrell's movies. He knows how to take unusual characters and make them his own. But Anchorman is just too stupid. Will Ferrell is Ron Burgundy, a news anchor who is full of himself.The movie is funny in some parts, such as the dialogue between Burgundy, his co-workers, and rival reporters.David Koechner, Paul Rudd, and Steve Carell are all funny as Burgundy's news team.The best part is a fight between all the news teams. The heads of all the other news teams are hilarious cameos by Vince Vaughn, Luke Wilson, Tim Robbins, and Ben Stiller.The dialogue is witty, but sometimes the movie gets to be too dumb.",7,1,1,21 May 2010
Stranger Than Fiction," A Brilliant Comedy-Drama with a Great Leading Performance and Strong Screenplay
","Everyone knows Will Ferrell for his funny, goofball laugh out loud comedy roles like Elf, Blades of Glory, and Talladega Nights. However, he has a different kind of comedy he has proved he can do with Stranger Than Fiction.Stranger Than Fiction stars Ferrell as Harold Crick, a lonely IRS Agent whose life is just boring. For the past twelve years, he has been living the same life doing the same routine of waking up, brushing his teeth, riding the bus to work, and so on. His life is changed when he starts hearing a voice narrating what he is doing as he is doing it, such as counting brush strokes. Ferrell is just an absolute wonder in this role. He shows many emotions throughout the film and proves that he can do more than be the goofball that he usually is.As he continues to hear this voice, he finds new meanings to his life. One of the bigger changes occurs when he and another co-worker receive new audits. One of the ones Harold takes on is a local baker named Anna played by Maggie Gyllenhaal. Gyllenhaal is also great at showing a range of emotions as she starts showing anger and hostility toward Harold, later revealing sweetness and love toward him.While Harold is going through the craziness of hearing the voice, he consults the help of Professor Jules Hilbert, played by the very talented Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman is great at being laid back and acting like a friend toward Harold. At the same time, he is very knowledgeable about the literature and being able to help Harold.Emma Thompson is also a treat as Karen Eiffel, who is writing the book that Harold is in. She is great at expressing her sarcasm and is very believable as someone who has writer's block and cannot figure out how to finish her book.Director Marc Forster is great at mixing the performances of these actors, and does an excellent job in telling the story, making it both a comedy and a drama. Forster's work shows brilliance in blending the two, making this a great film.What is the strongest element of Stranger Than Fiction is the writing of screenwriter Zach Helm. Helm is great at introducing Harold to the audience and making great character development on him as we get to know Harold, from our own view and from Karen's view. Helm is also great at making this script a great showcase for a character to find life again. Helm's screenplay shows many funny and serious situations that showcase a great story that is told excellently on film.",9,0,0,28 March 2011
The Waterboy," Adam Sandler is funny
","What do you get when you combine Adam Sandler and a football movie? A fun movie. Adam Sandler plays Bobby Boucher, a longtime waterboy for the local college football team. However, the players have always made fun of him and have given him a hard time. One day, Bobby has had enough of the players making fun of him so he decides to tackle one of the players out of nowhere. When the coach, played by Henry Winkler (a.k.a. Fonzie), notices Bobby's tackle, he decides to see what it would be like to make him a linebacker.Despite Bobby's mother (played by Kathy Bates) not approving of Bobby playing, the coach decides to play him anyway. The coach makes the objective to Bobby to picture somebody's head on the quarterback's body. This works for a while.There is a love interest, played by Fairuza Balk. Some of the frequent supporting players in Adam Sandler's movies appear in bit parts. Director Frank Coraci mixes the football action with the comedy.",7,3,4,21 May 2010
The Conjuring," Scary and chilling. I loved it!
","I am usually not one for horror movies. In fact, I am very selective when it comes to seeing or skipping horror movies. However, I do find James Wan to be a very good director. I still need to see Insidious, but the first Saw movie, which he directed, is the only good one of its franchise.The film begins with two roommates being interviewed by Ed Warren (Patrick Wilson) and his wife Lorraine (Vera Farmiga) , paranormal researchers, regarding a possessed doll which they named Annabelle. This interview is shown on a film at a college seminar where the Warrens are guest speakers. The film then cuts to Roger Perron (Ron Livingston), his wife Carolyn (Lili Taylor), and their five daughters moving into a new home in the country part of Rhode Island. However, their dog Sadie refuses to enter, being suspicious of the house. Shortly after, the family notices strange things happening. Carolyn wakes up with random bruises on her body. The clocks stop at 3:07. The daughters find themselves being messed with while asleep. When the girls are scared out of their minds, Carolyn goes to the Warrens for help. They take on the job for the Perrons. While there, the Warrens look for all details of why the Perrons' house is possessed.The highest praise for this film goes to director James Wan. His attention to details show here. He does a great job of sticking to the story and script. His direction of each actor from Wilson and Farmiga to Livingston and Taylor, to even the daughters works so well that he got great performances from his actor.Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga knock their roles out of the park as Ed and Lorraine Warren. Wilson does great as a man who has been through a lot with past jobs regarding other paranormal research, but shows that he truly cares for the Perrons' who don't know where else to turned to. Farmiga is moving as Lorraine, who can see more into the lives of everyone else. She is also moving as a mother who cares for her daughter and can see the pain of Carolyn. Livingston does some fine work as the Perron patriarch, who shows gratitude for the Warrens and loves his family. Taylor is moving as a mother and chilling in the film's final act. The daughters each do a good job with their role.There were a lot of great technical aesthetics to this film. I enjoyed the camera work by DP John R. Leonetti. I also enjoyed Leonetti's work with natural lights and with regular lights for each shot. The production design (more specifically the house), is very well done and Julie Berghoff's work here with attention to details of making this house be haunted and believable is excellence. Composer Joseph Bishara makes some truly chilling music that makes each scene for effective in terms of scary and jumpy. The editing by Kirk M. Morri is effective and well put together. The makeup artists do a wonderful job. The sound design is also excellent, not just for the music, but the use of natural sound as well as putting other sounds to make the creepiness of what makes things sound scary even more effective.",9,10,20,8 July 2013
Shrek," Worth watching every time
","I first saw Shrek opening weekend in 2001 and have loved it ever since. It starts out by making fun of the storybook approach with Shrek reading out loud and using a page from the book as toilet paper. It then follows with Donkey potentially being sold with many other fairy tale creatures. Shrek involuntarily comes to the rescue as Donkey is trying to escape. However, Donkey will not leave him alone. So Shrek makes him a deal where he can spend one night at Shrek's home. However, Shrek looks outside to find all the famous fairy tale characters are at his swamp. He finds out that Lord Farquaad evicted them and sent them there.So it's up to Shrek and Donkey to meet Lord Farquaad and make a deal to get rid of the fairy tale characters and have his swamp back. Lord Farquaad makes him a deal that if he wins a tournament, he must retrieve Princess Fiona from a dragon-guarded castle in the highest room in the tallest tower. However, Shrek is in for something else after he rescues Fiona.The whole plot is just genius at making fun of the fairy tales we have all heard growing up, and at the same time, being its own film. Mike Myers is great at bringing his own style of humor to the title character. What I also like about Myers's performance is how he brings his own emotions and making them Shrek's. Eddie Murphy is also brilliant at bringing his style of humor to the part of Donkey. The best part of Murphy's performance is how he makes his lines memorable.I enjoy the script and seeing the story unfold as we peel back layers of the characters and who they are. It makes me think of one of Shrek's famous quotes in the film: 'Ogres are like onions. We both have layers.' The film has so much funny dialogue and a great story. I find that the movie is still worth watching 10 years later.",10,0,2,16 May 2011
The Wolverine," An Excellent Addition to the Wolverine Saga
","Wolverine is my favorite superhero and I am a huge fan of the X-Men movies as the first two are my favorite of all superhero movies. I enjoy that Fox has been taking on Wolverine and doing films about him. James Mangold, whose previous directing credits include Walk the Line and 3:10 to Yuma, is the man helming this new Wolverine adventure.The Wolverine begins with Logan (Hugh Jackman) as a prisoner in a POW camp in Japan during World War II, where he saves a soldier named Yashida after the American drop the atomic bomb. This however, is a flashback as Logan wakes up finding himself in bed next to Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who he ends up killing back in X-Men: The Last Stand. This is also a flashback as Logan currently lives a recluse life in the Canadian wilderness. Logan is found by Yukio (Rila Fukushima), a fellow mutant who has the power to see how people die. Yukio is there to find Logan and bring him to Japan as Yashida is dying. In Japan, Logan also meets Mariko (Tao Okamoto), Yashida's granddaughter. Yashida offers to trade powers with Logan, who turns down the offer. However, a woman named Viper (Svetlana Khodchenkova) introduces something into Logan's body that makes him vulnerable. The next day, Yashida passes away and at the funeral, the Yakuza tries to kidnap Mariko, but Logan interjects and gets Mariko out of Tokyo. Logan and Mariko hide out in a house in Nagasaki. Meanwhile, Viper talks with Yashida bodyguard Harada (Will Yun Lee), who is forced to hunt Logan and Mariko down. The film deals with Logan dealing with the demons of his past, specifically seeing Jean in his hallucinations, and fighting with Viper and the Silver Samurai.James Mangold does a great job with directing this and shows his talents with each scene, the cast, and handling the material. Mangold knows when the drama is necessary and when to keep the film exciting showing his excellence in directing a superhero movie. Like all films, there needs to be a great script and Mark Bomback and Scott Frank deliver with a great one that makes for one exciting Wolverine movie.Hugh Jackman is great as always as Wolverine. Yet this time around, he is more interesting seeing him as a more vulnerable and human like character. He is also more relateable as someone with some demons in his past and trying to fight new ones. Rila Fukushima is interesting in her role as fellow mutant Yukio who fights alongside Wolverine and becomes a reliable asset. Tao Okamoto is also great in her role as Mariko, who is more than a damsel in distress and is someone who can fight, just not in the same way that Wolverine and Yukio do. I enjoyed seeing Famke Janssen return as Jean. She did what the role needed, but nothing more.From a technical standpoint, I truly enjoyed the work with the camera by DP Ross Emery as it is some of the best camera work in a superhero movie. The production design by FranÃ§ois Audouy is very nice and had some very cool looking sets. Michael McCusker's editing is crisp and well put together. The sound design is quite enjoyable with the combination of dialog, the sound effects, and the combination of the exciting score by composer Marco Beltrami. The visual effects are also a feast for the eyes.",9,9,19,31 July 2013
Get Him to the Greek," Very funny movie
","This movie is just as funny as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, director Nicholas Stoller's debut as a director. He makes a very solid sophomoric effort here with Get Him to the Greek, which is a spin off on Forgetting Sarah Marshall. Stoller knows how to make the situations hilarious and how to make the laughs keep coming scene after scene.Jonah Hill is hilarious in the leading role as Aaron Green, a representative at a music company who has to get singer Aldous Snow (Russell Brand) to the Greek Theater in Los Angeles in three days. Brand is a riot reprising his role as Aldous Snow. Brand shows that Aldous Snow is still just as ridiculous as he was in Forgetting Sarah Marshall, but he also shows us that there is to more to Aldous Snow than we thought we knew.Rose Byrne plays Jackie Q, a singer and ex-girlfriend of Aldous. She does a fine job, but she isn't given a whole lot to do with this role. The same goes for Elisabeth Moss, who plays Aaron's girlfriend Daphne. Moss is given more to work with and she does a good job.Sean Combs (a.k.a. P.Diddy) is a scene stealer and a hilarious supporting player as Sergio, Aaron's boss. Combs is a riot and shows that he can do comedy.The laughs keep coming and the situations are absolutely laugh out loud funny. While not as funny as Forgetting Sarah Marshall, it is still a very solid effort from all involved. Judd Apatow is one of the best comedy producers out there today, and he proves it again here. If you liked Forgetting Sarah Marshall, you should like Get Him to the Greek.",9,3,9,5 June 2010
The Hangover Part III," A Finale to Remember
","We have now come to the conclusion of Todd Phillip's Hangover trilogy four years after the Wolfpack took on Vegas and won.The film begins in a prison in Thailand were a guard sees a riot in his prison. The guard walks through the prison to find that Mr. Chow (Ken Jeong) has escaped through his cell, a direct Shawshank Redemption reference. Chow is running through the sewers where he gets away and ends up in the water.After the opening credits, the films transitions to Alan (Zack Galifianakis) driving on the freeway with a giraffe he just bought. Alan is enjoying his life until the giraffe hits a bridge and gets decapitated, which then causes a wreck. Sid (Jeffrey Tambor) is not happy with Alan and tells him that if he doesn't get back on his medicine that he quit taking, he'll get cut off. Shortly after, Sid has a heart attack and passes away. At the funeral, Alan does a wonderful job of singing 'Ave Maria' and gives a eulogy that insults both his mother and sister. His pals, their wives, and his mother meet to discuss getting him to a rehab center and know Alan won't comply unless Phil, Stu, and Doug take him there after holding an intervention.On the way to the rehab center in Arizona, Phil's minivan is hit repeatedly and the Wolfpack are tied up by Black Doug (Mike Epps), who turns out to be working for a man named Marshall (John Goodman). Marshall stops them because of their association with Mr. Chow. Turns out that Black Doug selling the wrong drugs to Alan set off a chain of events bigger than they realized, that resulted in Mr. Chow stealing $21 million in gold from Marshall. After telling the Wolfpack about this, Marshall forces them to bring Chow to him or he'll kill Doug.Alan convinces Mr. Chow to meet up with him while Chow is in Tijuana. They try to drug Chow to pass him out, but to no avail. Chow helps them get the gold he owes Marshall, but turns on the Wolfpack and steals Phil's minivan and takes it to Vegas.The story is very entertaining with interesting plot twists that make this finale one to remember. Todd Phillips's direction here is not as good as the first, but he does a great job at keeping Part III entertaining and hilarious. Phillips also co-wrote the script with his longtime writing partner Craig Mazin. They do a great job of keeping the story moving forward and keeping the story entertaining and hilarious.Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, and Justin Bartha all do good jobs, but it's not much more than what we've already seen from them in the first two Hangover movies. Zack Galifianakis steals the show as this film is Alan's show. Zack does great at showing a wider range of emotion, even more than what Phillips got out of him in Due Date. Zack does great at conveying Alan's happiness, sadness, anger, and anxiety. Ken Jeong is an even bigger laugh riot as Mr. Chow, proving once a criminal, always a criminal. John Goodman is awesome as the angry Marshall, who wants what Chow stole from him. Also doing a great job is Melissa McCarthy as Cassandra, a pawn shop employee who is what Alan would be like if Alan was a woman.It was also nice to see Mike Epps come back as Black Doug and Heather Graham return as Jade, Stu's stripper ex-wife. I also enjoyed the cinematography by Lawrence Sher, who got some amazing shots of Tijuana and Las Vegas, especially the night time shots.",9,4,7,24 May 2013
Click," Adam Sandler is funny and dramatic in this original work
","I have always known Adam Sandler to be the funny, goofy character that he usually is. In the case of this movie, he is only half funny. The other half is more dramatic.In Click, he plays Michael Newman, a workaholic architect who wants to spend time with his family, but says he can't because he is given too much to do. When he takes a break to watch TV and can't find the right remote, he decides he needs to find a universal remote. However, Michael gets more than what he bargained for.Then he meets Morty, played excellently by Christopher Walken. At first, Walken shows us that Morty is a nice guy. Morty works in the 'Beyond' section of Bed, Bath, and Beyond. He helps out Michael by giving him a universal remote. However, instead of it controlling a TV, DVD player, stereo, and other electronics, the remote controls Michael's life. It starts out being a good thing helping him out. Michael wants to enjoy the good parts of his life, but he manages to have programmed the remote to skip parts of his life that are good and bad. Michael misses many parts of his life because of the remote skipping. Later near Michael's death, Morty turns out to be the Angel of Death.Michael learns his lesson and is given another chance at his life when he is back at the point of his life before he gets the remote.It is a good movie that shows that Adam Sandler can be a good actor and still be funny.Director Frank Coraci shows that he can mix the elements of an Adam Sandler comedy and have some good drama, and it works.The makeup effects of Adam Sandler's character are some brilliant work by the best makeup artist in the movie business, Rick Baker.",8,1,2,21 May 2010
Pineapple Express," Ridiculously funny
","From producer Judd Apatow and director David Gordon Green comes a stoner comedy for guys to enjoy. Starring and written by Seth Rogen, Rogen plays Dale, a process server who hands out subpoenas to people who don't want them. On an ordinary night, Dale is supposed to serve papers to a rich drug lord, played by Gary Cole. dale witnesses a murder and goes to his drug dealer's (played by James Franco, trying to break away from being famous for the Spider-Man franchise) apartment.Franco steals the show in this role as he is believable as a lazy, slacker drug dealer. Franco takes this character that seems like can be played by anyone and makes it his own. Danny McBride gives a breakthrough performance as Red, who is also caught in this mess thanks to Dale and Saul (Franco).It is a good mix of action and comedy. It is as much funny as it is action packed. It fits in with other Frat Pack movies such as Talladega Nights and Superbad. It is a must see for fans of the Frat Pack.",8,5,8,22 May 2010
Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted," I am hoping this is the end to this series.....
",".....and I mean this in a good way. If Dreamworks ends this series with this film, then they have ended a fun franchise on a positive note.The film begins with Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria still in Africa with the penguins taking the plane to Monte Carlo to hit up the casinos big time and promising they will return. However, the penguins never come back and the four heroes end up growing old in Africa. This turns out to be a recurring nightmare for Alex. After this, the four decide to go to Monte Carlo themselves and track down the penguins themselves.When their plan goes awry and they are seen by tourists, Captain DuBois, a French animal control expert makes it her mission to track down the animals, and more specifically, Alex. In order to keep themselves hidden away from DuBois, the four heroes, along with the monkeys, King Julien, Maurice, and Mort, all stumble upon a European traveling circus. They find out that this circus may be their ticket back to their home in New York.The story is a fun and interesting one, with some hilarious jokes and unexpected plot twists. The script was written by co-director Eric Darnell and Noah Baumbach, whose previous writing credits include Fantastic Mr. Fox and the Ben Stiller starring vehicle Greenberg. They do a great job of keeping this story interesting.Stiller, Chris Rock, David Schwimmer, and Jada Pinkett Smith all return to voice their respective characters for the third time and continue to do their jobs well.There are two standouts in this cast, who are also two new arrivals. Bryan Cranston voices Vitaly, a circus tiger with a bitter outlook on life and is not interested in having anything to do with Alex. The other big standout is Frances McDormand as Captain DuBois, who will stop at nothing until she has captured Alex and has his head on her mantle.The film has three directors: Darnell, Tom McGrath, and Conrad Vernon. These three all do a great job of keeping the story together. There is never a boring moment in the film. They also do an excellent job of sticking to the story in the film and letting it control how the film goes.As a family film, both the kids and the adults will enjoy it. The kids will get some enjoyment out of seeing the animals on screen. The parents will enjoy this for a good story.",8,0,1,10 June 2012
Inside Llewyn Davis," Coen Brothers Continue Their Excellence with Oscar Isaac Anchoring
","It goes without saying that Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, a.k.a. The Coen Brothers, are among the top working filmmakers today. They keep showing us repeatedly why they are among the best and proved it again with their latest flick, Inside Llewyn Davis.The title character, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a folk singer who is not living an ideal life. Llewyn gets himself gigs every once in a while, he lives in New York City, but his records are not selling, his former singing partner has killed himself, and he is crashing on the couches of his friends since he does not have a home. With all of the troubles Llewyn has going on in his life, he cannot catch a break. His friend Jim (Justin Timberlake) cannot give him money without his wife Jean (Carey Mulligan) finding out. Jean is also pregnant and thinks that the child is Llewyn's. She wants an abortion and for Llewyn to pay for it. Inside Llewyn Davis focuses on one week of the title character's life as he does whatever he can to change his life.The Coen Brothers are still among the true auteurs out there and still have been doing what they've been doing for 30 years and produce excellent results. Inside Llewyn Davis shows us the Coens have a keen interest in showing us a character who is a loser and make us be interested in this character. As writers, the Coens have crafted a unique story in 1960's New York with quirky characters.At the front and center of the film is Oscar Isaac as Llewyn Davis. Isaac is very interesting here in becoming this guy who is having no success as a folk singer. Isaac's strong points in his performance are in making us feel sympathy for a guy who is a loser that can't catch a break. Isaac proves that he can make a great leading man.The rest of the cast do their contributions nicely. Carey Mulligan is the best of the supporting cast as Jean, Jim's wife and a woman who thinks Llewyn is a scumbag but cares for him too. Justin Timberlake is good here as a Jim, a fellow folk singer who brings on Llewyn for a song he wrote. Garrett Hedlund and John Goodman are also fun in their roles as fellow musicians who are travelling to Chicago and let Llewyn ride with them. F. Murray Abraham even has a nice cameo as the owner of a Chicago venue who gives Llewyn an audition.The technical aspects of this film are well done, like all Coen Brother films. Oscar winner T-Bone Burnett is the music producer and does a nice job with having the music all fit the film. There is beautiful cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel. Frequent Coen collaborator Jess Gonchor does a nice job with the production design and making the sets feel authentic to the time period. Also involved is another frequent Coen collaborator is costume designer Mary Zophres who does not disappoint here. The other major highlight is 'Please Mr. Kennedy', a song in the film that Llewyn contributes to recording.",8,2,5,10 January 2014
Her," A Beautiful, Touching Comedy-Drama
","To this day, I still find it amazing that filmmaker Spike Jonze started his career with doing a lot of work associated with MTV and Jackass. Since that, Jonze has proved himself to be a legitimate feature filmmaker with Bein John Malkovich, Adaptation, and Where the Wild Things Are in his resume. Jonze has now shown himself to be a great filmmaker again with his latest comedy-drama, Her.Theodore Twombley (Joaquin Phoenix) is a lonely man. He lives in a Los Angeles apartment alone and has a job where he writes letters for others and sends them out at the end of the day. Theodore is sad mainly because of his impending divorce from his wife Catherine (Rooney Mara). Subsquently, Theodore purchases a new operating system with artificial intelligence, which is designed to have a real relationship with him. After the operating system has set up, Theodore begins to talk to it like a regular person. The operating system has taken the name Samantha (Scarlett Johansson). From there on, Theodore and Samantha have a real relationship and Theodore is a lot happier, but not all the time. Theodore has a nice time with a blind date (Olivia Wilde) until she says that she wants a commitment. But, Theodore also has become closer to his neighbor Amy (Amy Adams), who he dated briefly in college.Spike Jonze has always directed scripts written by others or ones that he co-wrote. Her marks the first time Jonze is directing a feature he wrote by himself. As a director, Jonze shows his skill with showing us where to look and what's important to his story. Jonze also does some very brilliant work as a writer in setting up the blueprints to this film and creating a world in the not too distant future where technology has made many advancements. As a writer and director, Spike Jonze tells a story that made me feel happy, sad, and emotionally invested in these characters.Joaquin Phoenix is the heart and soul of Spike Jonze's Her. Phoenix gives his best performance since Walk the Line. With the role of Theodore Twombley, Phoenix gives us a raw and emotional performance. Phoenix makes Theodore into somebody who is lonely, funny, romantic, and heartbreaking at the same time. Phoenix carries this film on his shoulders and makes us feel for Theodore and relate to him.The ladies surrounding Phoenix all do great jobs with their part. Scarlett Johansson makes herself stand out using only her voice as Theodore's operating system, Samantha. Johansson makes us also interested in knowing about Samantha the same way Theodore does. Amy Adams also makes herself stand out as neighbor Amy. Adams shows her raw side here too as her husband leaves her and she finds herself in a situation just like Theodore's. Rooney Mara is nice to see as ex-wife Catherine. While her character isn't fully fleshed out, Mara does fine with her role of Catherine, moreso showing her frustration and irritation with her ex-husband. Olivia Wilde was also nice to see as the blind date who was trying to start something too fast. Even though he's no lady, Chris Pratt also has a nice brief role as Theodore's co-worker and friend Paul. While this role wasn't a stretch, Pratt is nice comic relief for the film.Along with the hard work and efforts of Jonze, Phoenix, and the cast, the crew does some beautiful work from a technical standpoint. Director of Photography Hoyte van Hoytema does very beautiful camera work and lighting here with capturing Los Angeles at day and night. K.K. Barrett, who has worked as production designer on Spike Jonze's previous features, does his best work here at bringing Los Angeles in the near future to life. I enjoyed the collaboration here as Jonze and Barrett do a nice job with the possibilities of how much technology could advance, but making the look feel that it's still a world we as and audience can still relate to. Arcade Fire provided the score and do a lovely job with the piano music. I also highly enjoyed 'The Moon Song', which plays when Theodore goes on vacation to the mountains.Her is a beautiful, wonderful comedy-drama with many laugh out loud moments. It also is an interesting look into what the future may hold.",9,1,3,10 January 2014

During this time, both of the leading characters realize that they are only right for each others.Adam Sandler and Drew Barrymore are great together and have amazing chemistry as the leads. Director Frank Coraci makes the story just right to be funny, entertaining, and interesting without cheesing it up. This is a movie for anyone who is a fan of Adam Sandler and romantic comedies.",8,0,1,21 May 2010
Shark Tale," It's fun enough
","I honestly think that this is one of the Dreamworks Animation films that is nowhere near among their best. But it still is entertaining and fun.Will Smith stars as the voice of Oscar, a fish who seems content with just working at a whale wash. He keeps coming up with these ideas to make a quick buck that never pan out. They cause him to owe a substantial amount of money to his boss, Mr. Sykes. However, we find out that he really wants more out of life.When he has the money he owes ready to turn in, he ends up betting it instead. First, it causes a fish named Lola to be attracted to him. Then, the seahorse he bets on loses causing him to be tortured by Sykes's jellyfish assistants until some sharks come to attack him. One of them dies. The jellyfish think Oscar killed the shark. Oscar goes with their assumption.This causes him to live a huge lie. In order for the other fish to not find out, he must conceal with the other shark, Lenny, voiced by Jack Black. However, Oscar's close friend Angie, voiced by Renée Zellweger, finds out about Oscar's and Lenny's act and also has to keep it a secret.It's basically a fun story about a fish who keeps telling lie after lie in order to keep his reputation as the Shark Slayer. While it is not the best of Dreamworks, there is still some fun to it.My likes: I thought it was cool how the city that the film takes place in looks like an underwater version of New York City. I thought it was cool how the animation was able to capture the look of Times Square and make it look like a city for fish. I also liked seeing the sharks as a representation of the mafia. It was a great fit seeing how dominant sharks are. I also thought the actors all fit the characters they were voicing, especially Robert De Niro as Don Lino.My dislikes: I thought there were too many pop culture references. There were way too many lines and scenes that were referencing other films or related to modern culture. Most of the references will not be relevant 10, 20 years from now. The story drags at many times and throws off the pace of the film.",7,1,1,16 May 2011
Draft Day," Excellent Look Into the Biggest Day of the NFL Offseason
","I'm always up for a good football movie and I'm pretty sure that hasn't been one since 2009 when The Blind Side came out. Now, we have a new story from director Ivan Reitman about that one day in the NFL offseason everyone anticipates, Draft Day.The film begins hours before the NFL Draft begins, and Sonny Weaver Jr. (Kevin Costner) is just getting ready for the day that may make or break his tenure as the General Manager of the Cleveland Browns. Sonny knows everything that is going on even before getting to the office. He has ESPN on his TV at home, and listens to all the sports radio talk. Early in the day, Sonny makes a deal with the Seattle Seahawks, who have the #1 pick and are expected to take hotshot quarterback Bo Callahan. The deal involved the Browns getting the #1 pick from the Seahawks in exchange for their first round picks for the next three seasons. Everyone is expecting Sonny to pick Callahan, but there are two other prospects Sonny is interested in: a linebacker with a good heart but a mouth on him named Vontae Mack (Chadwick Boseman) and running back Ray Jennings (Current Houston Texans running back Arian Foster), whose father Earl (Terry Crews) was a Browns legend. This move has made Browns fans happy put has angered some Browns personnel, such as head coach Vince Penn (Denis Leary) and starting quarterback Brian Drew (Tom Welling). Ultimately, the choice belongs to Sonny, who is also facing some personal issues with his father, a legendary coach, having passed away a week before the film begins and his girlfriend and fellow co-worker Allie (Jennifer Garner) is pregnant with his child. The film goes through Sonny's day with dealing all the pressure, especially from owner Anthony Molina (Frank Langella).Ivan Reitman has done an awesome job of telling a football story revolving around a big media frenzy every year. I like that he focuses the story on Kevin Costner's sunny and making about the GM of the team, a very tough job indeed. He and director of photography Eric Steelburg (who has shot Reitman's son's films) do a nice job of intertwining the phone conversations between any two characters, usually Sonny and somebody else.Kevin Costner is just excellent at the front and center of this film. He is great at being the man under pressure from every one and their cousin as his job is on the line. Jennifer Garner is good in her part as girlfriend Allie, but I think any actress could have played that part. Denis Leary is great as the coach who wants to win. Frank Langella was enjoyable as the owner, but my favorite supporting performance was Chadwick Boseman as hothead linebacker Vontae Mack.Cleveland Browns fans will certainly be happy with this film being about their team. While I am not a Browns fan, I got a football movie I highly enjoyed.",9,14,25,11 April 2014
Dodgeball," Am awesome sports comedy
","The old idea of a guy who doesn't have much in life and doesn't care is brought in with new originality by director Rawson Marshall Thurber. Vince Vaughn plays the aforementioned character named Peter LaFleur. His motives change when he finds out he has a month to pay off the damage he owes to the bank or else his gym will be destroyed by a rival gym owner. That rival gym owner is White Goodman, played hilariously in a supporting role by Ben Stiller. Goodman wants to provide more parking for his customers.When LaFleur lets his friends know what the deal is, he lets them make suggestions. They try a car wash and fail miserably. After that, LaFleur caves in until a member suggests entering a dodgeball tournament. They go for it only to have Goodman's team be the antagonists.This movie is fun with the laughs continuously coming. Vaughn and Stiller give funny, original performances. There is also some really funny jokes in the dialogue and the situations.",8,0,1,21 May 2010
Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby," Will Ferrell creates a comedy icon
","The second collaboration between Will Ferrell and director Adam McKay is proved to be the best with Talladega Nights. Will Ferrell stars as Ricky Bobby, a race car driver who wants to go fast. We already know why he wants to win when his dad tells him 'If you ain't first, you're last.' He already has a sidekick named Cal Naughton Jr. (played by John C. Reilly). He becomes a new race car driver and Ricky's teammate. Their friendship and Ricky's career become threatened by a new French driver (played by Sacha Baron Cohen of Borat fame) and when a wreck psychologically damages him. Ricky loses his wife (Leslie Bibb) to Cal and has to learn how to drive fast from his deadbeat dad (Gary Cole) to be able to get his game back. He gets motivation and finds new love in his assistant Susan (Amy Adams).McKay makes this movie full of fun races, hilarious ads by Ricky, and makes it a good time for everyone. Will Ferrell shows what makes him one of the funniest comedy actors in this day and age.",8,0,0,22 May 2010
Semi-Pro," Not the best of Will Ferrell, but has its moments
","Will Ferrell has a knock for starring in sports comedies. This is the fourth one he has made. It is a comedic turn on a semi-professional basketball league that folds and where four teams from the semi-pro league get to join the NBA. It doesn't compare to Will Ferrell's other sports comedies such as Blades of Glory or Talladega Nights. Ferrell does a fine job, but he has done much better than this. I think if the story was a little more focused on the team and a little less focused on Ferrell or the league merger, this movie would have been better. Woody Harrelson also appears in this movie and does a fine job, but he has also done much better acting than this. It is worth renting at least once if you are a fan of Will Ferrell.",6,0,0,22 May 2010
