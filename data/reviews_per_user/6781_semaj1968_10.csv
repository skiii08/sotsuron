Blade Runner 2049," Visually Stunning but .......
","I was so looking forward to this, Blade Runner is in my Top Ten films, I still remember the impact it made when I first saw it on VHS in 1984, totally blew me away.2049 didn't, I forked out for IMAX 3D and don't get me wrong yes you can clearly see the effort that went into the cinematography and some scenes are beautiful but that doesn't make a film.All through the film I kept thinking it's too light, it didn't have the dark atmospheric claustrophobic feel of the original. Interior/exterior all felt too light, soundtrack wasn't as good as the original and no memorable quotes or scenes. I felt it a bit clichéd dragging in bits from the original film as a reminder/flash back.Ford couldn't seem to muster that old Deckard magic to the point I felt for the time he's in it was it worth it. The whole colours and visuals around entering what I think was meant to be Vegas was great and beautiful the giant sculptures reminded me of the Movie A.I. that scene where they hitch a lift to the pleasure city.I will probably watch it again to see how I feel but sitting in the cinema it just felt way too long, I could see people checking their watches a good film shouldn't have people doing that.Spoilers ******************************************* The ending could have just finished with Agent K laying on the steps in the snow bleeding out and for me that would have been fine, it framed nicely looking down on him. We knew Deckard was going in to meet his daughter for the first time, we knew who she was as soon as you saw the building to go that extra minute or so showing what happened next, unnecessary.",3,5,10,9 October 2017
It," 'It' is now the definitive
","I can't understand the negative reviews at all, I've read the book twice and loved every sentence of 'It' The original was good and Tim Curry legendary as Pennywise but by god Skarsgad does an excellent job. It really does stand up against the original and surpasses it of course there is a bigger budget here and way better effects. There is nothing really scary about it like any normal horror but it's a great drama with the ageless charm of ' Stand By Me ' and the supernatural of ' Stranger Things ' you really can't go wrong and for me this hasn't.The casting is superb all the kids interactions are well done and funny, Pennywise is excellent and will make you hate clowns all over again. The town of Derry looks quaint and charming and you would want to spend your summers there once 'It' has went to sleep.It remains to see how the handle Chapter 2 and who they cast, for me casting big names to the roles may ruin it. I personally feel it won't be as good as Chapter 1 but if they get anywhere near it and do a decent reveal of 'It' then job well done.For me this is now the Defin-It-I've version",10,7,16,12 September 2017
Rogue One: A Star Wars Story," A hark back to the old days
","Beware, Here there be SpoilersGoing into this I had to keep my expectations in check but what I saw before me was something that took me back to my childhood. The Easter eggs and there are many had me delighted, when Tarkin appeared and turned to face the screen you could hear the whisper spread throughout the cinema ' They resurrected Peter Cushion ' Took me awhile to come down from that.There is many great scenes in this, the ambush of the Storm trooper supply train was awesome, something you could imagine happening in Iraq. Best lol moments supplied by K-2SO and you are totally gutted when he is taken down in a hail of blaster fire. The battle in the tropical setting was outstanding and equalled the Battle on Hoth, the space battle during all this and the coming together of 2 Star Destroyers was so well done and the attention to detail was excellent.This film truly captured the feel of when I first saw Star wars in 77 and Yes I would say this is on Par with Empire possibly even nudges ahead, down to the resurrecting old characters, when Vader appeared hairs stood up on the back of my neck, Vader we missed you man.If all this wasn't enough the final scene, the very last scene with Princess Leia a perfectly captured 18/19 yr old Carrie Fisher.....words fail me......I'm done...MEDIC!!!!!....WE NEED A MEDIC OVER.....Resurrect me when Blade Runner 2049 comes out",10,4,9,19 December 2016
Thor: Ragnarok," For those about to Ragnarok
","I read through some of the hate reviews and they must be purists of Thor and Ragnarok and by the looks of things they are in the minority for now.I had high hopes for this film after the disappointment of Blade Runner 2049 and all I can say is it didn't disappoint.For me personally this is the best film I've seen this year and by far the best Thor film, great visuals, great action and very, very funny.Some great cameos at the beginning that I wasn't expecting, excellent involvement of Dr Strange to get the ball rolling. my son thoroughly enjoyed and he's quite reserved when sitting watching a movie with me but he was laughing away and some of the scenes.Again as usual sit right to the end the very last credit Roll on Infinity War",10,39,68,30 October 2017
Spider-Man: Homecoming," Hey Ho, Let's Go
","I really was looking forward to this movie and it didn't disappoint. I personally prefer this over the other Spiderman movies, plenty of laughs, great effects and the inclusion of Stark/Iron man. Characters were great although I think Donald Glover could have been given a better role, he seemed to play a cliché black strung out hoodlum what a waste.Keaton as usual is awesome, with a great twist later in the movie I didn't see coming. I loved the fact they used a Ramones track in the movie, thank you.The very final scene when May appears at the bedroom door, just brilliant, whole cinema burst out laughing. As much as I liked this movie I think Thor will surpass it, roll on Infinity Wars Stark tech suit, when the suit is fully unlocked with a load of web combos I was thinking why so many and how is that possible a bit over the top but as the Ramones say Hey Ho let's go",9,29,52,7 July 2017
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2," So Good, Just Pure and Simple Pleasure
","The intro was one of the best I've seen in a movie for a long time, Mixture of Groot dancing to ELO's Mr Blue Skies while the rest fight in the background is pure mind blowing Joy. So many LOL moments, the cinema crowd were in stitches, I have to go see this again, I won't meander on too long but this for me was on par and up there for the first movie. That's tough thing to pull off these days as the firstwas mind blowing as I don't think anyone expected it to be so good again I was expecting this to be great but not as good but I was wrong. Part of me was hoping for another tentative link towards Infinity Wars but a minor niggle on my part. Great Movie Great Characters Great Laughs",10,72,126,8 May 2017
Jaws," This is my number 1 movie of all time
","I never tire of this movie, it just takes me away. I can't remember when I actually first saw the whole movie probably early 80s when we got out first VHS player. For me this is a movie that's grown over time and lost none of what makes a genuinely great movie experience. I remember hearing people talking about it in 75 when I was in primary school and was desperate to see it. It was worth the waitSo many quotable lines, the charm of Amity Island oh how I wish I had the money to visit there. In the 90's I actually took an American girl out to dinner who spent her summers at her grans house in Martha's Vineyard she would regale me with stories of life there.Spielberg really hit the mark with this three men in a boat experience you just can't beat just simple cinematography and atmosphere of them sitting around swapping injury stories and singing show me the way to go home before it all kicks off.Ellen: Martin hates boats. Martin hates water. Martin - Martin sits in his car when we go on the ferry to the mainland. I guess it's a childhood thing. It's a - there's a clinical name for it, isn't there?Chief Brody: Drowning!",10,0,1,19 October 2017
The Terminal," Charming Spielberg/Hank comedy
","I watched this again recently with my 16yr old son, who enjoyed it he was laughing and smiling throughout. 
I explained to him this is based on a trued story of Merhan Nasseri who lived in Frances main airport for 18 years which in itself is remarkable. I've seen a few negative reviews on this movie and personally I don't see why. They made the movie their own and in a comedic style and for me they pulled it off, yes of course you have to suspend belief with the likes of Zeta Jones who looks stunning in this falling for Viktor (Hanks) I mean would Zeta Jones fall for a much older guy in real life.....oh waitHers is a tragic character and I dare say there is some woman who are like that, keep falling for the wrong guy and keep going back for more.
The other sad character was played by Diego Luna stalking, yes lets be fair stalking Zoe Saldana and getting Viktor to get info from her then eventually presenting her with a ring. She still had no idea who was interested in her c'mon this is really where you have to suspend belief.Give this movie a go it's up there with 'Catch me if you can' another Spielberg/Hanks movie as an easy watch that is quite charming and sweeps you up.",8,0,0,22 January 2018
Back to the Future Part II," First one was a hard act to follow I suppose
","OK for me this wasn't going to be as good as the first, I was excited for it to see where they'd take the story next. Basically it threw a spanner in works right away when they jump forward to sort out Marty and Jen's kids. By the Doc coming back and getting them into the car and TAKING THEM OUT THE TIMELINE what did he think he'd find when he got to the Future.The basis was sent in the previous film when he jumped the DeLorean forward at Twin Pines Mall with the dog in it, the dog physically left the timeline to reappear 1 minute later. So by taking Marty and Jen out the timeline they should have appeared in 2015 with a changed scenario from Doc's perspective then that would have been the face palm DOH!!!! moment.The future tech was good Hover Boards the Nike Mags etc but then they went back and forth and it got all a bit muddy and busy story wise. When dealing with time film makers always over speculate progress of technology, The classic Blade Runner done this also, we're only 2 years away from 2019 and no where near the Technology suggested in the movie but that movie can be forgiven as it's so bloody good.This however is a film I can't be bothered to watch again, the other two yes but this one not really",4,6,10,11 May 2017
Blade Runner," A Distopian Future I can get behind
","I first saw this movie back in 1985 when a friend gave me a loan of it on VHS, never heard of it, I had no idea what it was about but my mate insisted I watched it. So one afternoon I settled down and stuck it in my player and what unfolded before my eyes was ART, PURE VISUAL ART.To me this movie is a masterpiece to a point it took me ages to return that tape to my mate. I own all versions, this movie was instantly in my top 5, now with the sequel coming out it will revive the original to a new generation.Whether you like SciFi or not you have to appreciate the attention to detail in this movie and you have to watch the making of Blade Runner the shear effort behind production.I could wax lyrical about scenes in this movie but to be honest it's something you just have to sit and watch without any distraction, just watch and take it all in and you know what once will not be enough.",10,2,5,19 December 2016
