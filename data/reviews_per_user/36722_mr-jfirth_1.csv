Iron Man 3," This is for all the people that don't understand the film
","First off, yes i do read the comics. Second off, everyone that didn't enjoy it, didn't understand the enemy and the stuff the Tony Stark went through.Aldrich Killian clearly states at the end he is the Mandarin, and it also doesn't show his dead body so he could come back. Also he could find the 'rings' later , or he could be covering for the Mandarin. There are plenty of ways he could come back.Yes this film has a little lack of action but the story is brilliant how Tony Stark grows as a character so much. The Mandarin could quite easily be brought into The Avengers or The next Iron Man film. The Mandarin is still just starting out and this won't be the last we see of him.I hope all the bad 'press' people are giving it won't put you off seeing this film.Making a film from comics in the real world can be quite challenging but i think they did a great job at it.",10,46,83,1 May 2013
