10 Cloverfield Lane," If I could rate 0, I would.
","How much did the producer pay the critics on rotten tomato to write positive reviews? This movie was EXTREMELY BORING up until the last maybe 5 minutes. It starts as a crazed doomsday prepper finally getting his wish and using his bunker, but with a twist he's a crazed murder. He kills off the guy, we find out he kidnapped a girl, and the main girl escapes only to find aliens polluting the world with a flammable gas. She kills it with a bottle of whiskey, lighting it on fire. It ends with her going to Huston to help save others. Very boring. I would have rather had a movie on the old man and him with the kidnapped girl. I just want to know where I could request to get my money back. Terrible.",1,98,200,12 March 2016
