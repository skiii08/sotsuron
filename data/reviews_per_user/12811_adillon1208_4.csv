Casablanca," A movie that you can watch again and again
","This is probably one of the greatest movies of all time. Something that one could watch over and over again, probably without getting sick of it.I have seen the movie quite a few times and I must say that it is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are the perfect match and it is a great story, great acting, and great romance.If you have never seen this movie, it is a classic that you are missing out on and I highly recommend that you go watch it as soon as you can. Classics become classics for a reason, and Casablanca is amazing.The picture is very interesting because they use a special lighting on their faces for dramatic moments and film Ingrid Bergman only from her left side, because she felt that was her better side.",10,1,2,8 March 2011
The Graduate," Great, Funny, and Ahead of It's time
","I cannot believe that this is a movie that I have not seen up until recently. Not only does it show how phenomenal of an actor Dustin Hoffman has ALWAYS been, but it also is a great story with a comedic twist to it all.After watching the movie in American Cinema class, I immediately went home and watched it AGAIN on Netflix. Truth be told... I will probably watch it several more times in the future.The storyline about a young college graduate having an affair with his parent's close friend, Mrs. Robinson, then soon falling mutually in love with her daughter is a great idea, and I must say that the story played out very well. It was unexpected that Mrs. Robinson would become some cruel and heartless in the end, but they also never thoroughly explained her reasoning behind it all. It was surprising and fantastic in the end, but I won't give that part away.This is a very entertaining, cute, and funny movie that one can watch over and over again.",10,1,1,30 April 2011
Singin' in the Rain," A Fantastic Mixture of Great Music and Old-Fashioned Entertainment
","I generally do not like musicals very much because they usually are sort of corny and just not my usual preference of entertainment. Singin' In the Rain, however, was something that I actually enjoyed watching very much.The movie was filled with flashy wardrobes and bright colors. The stars wore tons of make-up and enthusiastically performed talented dance moves and sang catchy tunes. There was a lot of comedy, but there was also an entertaining plot and content along with a good love story.I will admit that I also caught myself laughing out loud quite a bit, and it was very enjoyable to watch. I did not find myself getting bored or looking away once. I know that I had seen this a long time ago when I was younger, but I did not remember it very well. It was very refreshing to watch again for the first time in years, and I will honestly probably end up watching it again.The storyline with the movie star actress (Jean Hagen) being a royal witch with a B and having an annoying voice was a little corny, but still undeniably fun to watch. The ending, with Debbie Reynold's character winning the man (Gene Kelly) and becoming the huge star, was predictable, but that is part of what makes the movie a classic romantic comedy.If you are ever feeling down or depressed, perhaps because it is raining outside, put on Singin' In The Rain, and I can assure you almost completely that it will cheer you up.",8,3,5,12 April 2011
The Wizard of Oz," Great Classic that will always be remembered
","The Wizard of Oz is an amazing classic movie that I have watched several times in my life... all the way back to when I was very little. I even used to be afraid, especially of the flying monkeys! This is a film that I will probably watch several MORE times in my life, and I think that it is rare to find a person that has not seen it. And it is also pretty rare to find someone that did not like if not love it. Even if someone has not seen it they most certainly must have heard of it.The film takes you to a great fantasy land that turns to color and Judy Garland is fantastic in it. Although there are some points of joy, Dororthy, Toto, and her new friend have to overcome many obstacles to reach the Wizard of Oz. I even feel as though the picture and sound is pretty great for a 1939 film. In my mind this film is right up there with the classic, Gone With the Wind. Although both have very different story-lines and are totally different genres of films, they were both made the same year (to my knowledge), and will forever be remembered as wonderful movies to watch again and again and again. If you feel like escaping into the world of Dorothy, Toto, The scarecrow, the tinman, the cowardly lion, and of course the Wicked Witch of the West, then I highly recommend that you watch this classic movie. It is a treat that never gets old.",10,3,4,16 February 2011
