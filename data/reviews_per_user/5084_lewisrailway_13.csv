The Rock," Lock Them Up!
","Sean Connery generally appears to be a fine actor so i fail to understand why he lent his name to this embarrassingly juvenile cartoon.Acting,plot and continuity are all notable by their absence in a B movie on a big budget! We are expected to believe that super fit Marines can be defeated in hand to hand combat by 60 year old Connery and those same marines armed with machine guns will always miss; and the the sewers under the Rock will lit by powerful lights so we can see Connery [having been submerged] emerge with his hair dry and immaculate. The production team and cast should have been locked in a cell, and the key thrown away !",Null,0,1,8 January 2002
Raiders of the Lost Ark," The Smell Of Cheese.
","Abraham Lincoln apparently once said of something 'People who like this sort of thing will find this the sort of thing they like'.A lot of people must like Raiders then,for it to achieve #16 in the Top 250 movies.I watched it for the first time tonight and my honest opinion was...it STUNK! Nothing made any sense,the script was rubbish and the 'acting' was terrible. Indy has a clue where the Ark is hidden so he gathers a team of men and gets it out without the Germans noticing what he is doing? At every oppurtunity the Germans have to simply kill him,they tell him their plans[James Bond style]and tie him up?Having got the Ark [and tied Indy up instead of killing him!] the ark kills the Germans but spares Indy!I KNOW its only a fantasy but people generally seem to regard it as a really great film-perhaps that says more about them?",Null,1,2,11 May 2003
E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial," He should have stayed at home.
","In 'The Silence of the Lambs' Hannibal Lechter memorably said 'you must ask of each thing-what is it,in itself?'. Applying this to E.T., the plot is is basically that someone gets left behind by his friends and has to contact them to come back for him.Doesn't sound very promising,does it? Well it isn't,and E.T. like 'Star Wars' is one of those movies which masquerade as Science Fiction whist playing to an audience who would run away from the real thing. Stephen Spielberg,who appears to have [literally] 'lost the plot' after CE3K,  once admitted that E.T. was based on the Martian in 'The War Of The Worlds'[1953] and if you watch that classic movie you'll find that the only real alteration he made was to give E.T. a huge pair of blue eyes to appeal to the kiddie audience the movie was aimed at! Everything else in the movie was sugar coated frippery to appeal to the mass audience and barely deserves a mention. Two thoughts occur to me though; why didn't E.T.s fellow aliens realise he was missing and return for him? and since nobody destroyed his 'telephone' why didn't the authorities use it to contact the aliens? Like many people the hype surrounding this movie suckered me into seeing it in 1983 and i remember staggering out into Leicester Square thinking 'i could have bought 3 pints instead of seeing that'!   4/10.",Null,2,5,9 February 2002
The Terminator," The Shape of things to come.
","This movie is so lame-----only kidding! Seriously though,you can have fun by slamming kiddie sci-fi movies like 'Star Wars' or 'ET' and getting outraged messages from people who write in capital letters or put lots of exclamation marks to kid themselves they are making a valid point. When i saw 'The Terminator' in '84 it was one of those 'nothing better to do' nights-i had never heard of Arnie S. and knew it was fairly low budget,so didn't expect much. But Wow! Robot tanks firing laser beams over thousands of skulls in the First scene? The rest is history and Jim Cameron had crafted a masterpiece which was arguably the first real Science Fiction movie since '2001'. The action never lets up, but he still has beautifully observed scenes such as where Reese is fighting the Terminator endoskeleton and it tries to look round him to get at Sarah Connor,played by the lovely Linda Hamilton. The plot is pure Sci-Fi and as Sarah says 'a person could go crazy thinking about it'-i read a book where someone analysed the plot in detail and concluded that the Kyle Reese-Sarah Connor-John Connor triangle was what psychologists call 'primal scene fantasy'-our innate desire to be present at our own conception! Bad News; 54 year old Arnie is making T3 and we all know it will be full of CGI and really bad. Favourite dialogue in T1-Landlord-'Hey buddy,ya got a dead cat in there or what? Terminator-F**k you A***ole! In the cinema in 1984 a big cheer went up when he said that! 10/10",Null,0,0,13 February 2002
Armageddon," Lost In Space
","There is a saying that 'those who do not learn from history are condemned to repeat it'. In 1998 against my better judgment i actually PAID to see this shambolic movie, and last night i compounded the error by watching it on TV ! To quote Jeff Goldblum from Independence Day 'what the hell was i thinking'. Ham acting, cliche ridden dialogue and it stars Bruce Willis [!]-the crappest CGI effects imaginable, no attention to the laws of physics,and [as with ID] a speech from the American President which had me reaching for the sick bag. Other reviewers have summed it up better than i can, and if you read through the 'goofs' you'll get an idea of what you are in for if you watch this excrecence. Hollywood ought to have Movie Police, so Michael Bay could be arrested and we could all sleep safely at night!",Null,1,3,20 March 2002
Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines," No Cameron=No Plot=No Movie
","Its hard to objective about something you love,even when that something is a movie.I saw 'The Terminator' when it was released and thought [and still think] it was the best and most original Science Fiction movie i had ever seen.'Terminator 2' was a worthy successor with better SFX even though it lacked the darkness and originality of T1.The link between the two was of course James Cameron.And then we have T3,directed by Johnathan Mostow.I have tried to think of something positive to say about T3 but i can't except to say that its over quickly and marginally less painful than root canal work!In the first scene we see an Aerial HK,obviously CGI and totally unrealistic with even the design changed.Its downhill from there;you get the impression that Mostow had a series of ideas for setpieces and at the last minute had to come up with a story to link them.Nobody acts with any conviction,and Arnold is almost a parody of himself.And the dialogue!'I'll be back'-'She'll be back'-'He'll be back'.Need i go on? It hurts to have to criticise ANY movie with Terminator in the title,and i suppose anyone who has never seen T1 or T2 will love this but all i can say is 'I hope he'll not be back'!",Null,0,0,30 August 2003
Terminator 2: Judgment Day," Arnies' all time kick-up
","The debate about whether The Terminator or T2 is the better movie is, i believe,entirely pointless since they are essentially the same movie; i prefer to regard one as a continuation of the other with the difference that in T2 James Cameron had a $100 million dollar budget!  On the first night in London there was nearly a riot to get into the Odeon to see it,but i managed it and saw it another six times before i had had enough. The crucial difference to T1 is of course the introduction of Robert Patrick as the 'liquid metal' T-1000 [what happened to Ts801-999 ?] who gives an outstanding performance filled with menace in his sigle minded pursuit of young John Connor.The special effects are incredible especially the 'nuke' scene which a radio commentator described as a 'toilet moment' i.e. so traumatic that he had to rush out to the toilet rather than face it! Some aspects of T2 make more sense if you see the special edition, but together the two movies form the best Science Fiction Movie ever.10/10 or *****  P.S Those who like the time travel and cyborg elements of T1+T2 will find the New Outer Limits episodes 'A Stitch In Time' and 'The Camp' respectively,right up their street!",Null,1,1,19 February 2002
Independence Day," A 'Grower'
","Even Beavis and Butthead would probably describe Independence Day as a 'no brainer' and its true to say that when i first saw it [on the big screen] i hated it.But,surprisingly,when it came out on video i actully grew to like it! The plot has been lifted straight from HG Wells 'War Of The Worlds' or rather the 1953 movie, and once again shows how Earth is attacked by aliens and defended by a bunch of brave Americans with minimal assistance from the rest of the world. The special effects are mostly computer generated but seem to have been done with at least some attempt at realism; the characters are so one dimensional they would disappear if turned sideways, but Will Smith [playing Will Smith] is his usual likeable self. I have found out that the best way to view ID is to fast forward through the yucky bits to scenes such as the alien ships peeling away from the mothership, and savour them! Enough praise already; there are not so much plot holes as plot chasms [possible SPOILERS follow]--#1]Since the aliens seemed invincible,why did they co-ordinate their attack with a time signal? #2] Why did the aliens not use Neutron bombs to kill the Humans but leave the cities intact? #3] If mankind communicated by Morse code,the aliens had been monitoring our transmissions for many years so surely they would crack the code immediately? Despite all these criticisms ID is not a bad little movie,so 7/10 or *** out of ****  P.S. Fans of ID Should check out the New Outer Limits episode 'Trial By Fire' to see how good it COULD  have been!",Null,0,1,27 January 2002
Event Horizon," Non Event
","The basic premise of this movie is that a spaceship designed for hyperlight travel accidentally travels to Hell and back,which is pretty much how i felt as i left the cinema. #1] The Story;-there isn't one. #2]The Special Effects;- In the opening scene we are treated subjected]to a CGI rendition of objects and water floating in zero gravity. I have NEVER seen anything so spectacularly unrealistic in my life! How could anyone put this on tape and be happy with their work? #3] The Cast;-do quite well with the fatuous dialogue although Fishburne rarely has to do any more than look mean and moody. #4] The Physics;- Apparently the ship creates a mini Black Hole [which has immense gravity] so why isn't it crushed by the gravity? Overall;-Its a total mess, lacking direction or purpose so don't make the mistake i did and end up burning in Hell, hew to the true path and be rewarded in Heaven!",Null,0,1,7 July 2002
The Sixth Sense," Go straight to the End
","Like a fool i was suckered by all the hyp surrounding this movie when it was released,but the reality was very different. I have always regarded Bruce Willis as a 4th rate actor whose only ability was to look good in a dirty string vest,and 'Sixth Sense' did nothing to alter that opinion,although perhaps it was because he was'nt wearing the vest this time! [Was that a Spoiler?] The plot can be summed up thus 'psychologist investigates disturbed kid who sees ghosts' and once you know that, all you have to look forward to is the much vaunted ENDING. Suffice to say i saw the twist 20 minutes before it came and for friends this varied between 10 and 30 minutes! As usual Willis is so wooden i mistook him for a piece of furniture and although Osment is good for his age,this is no reason to shell out hard earned money to watch this drivel. Maybe in 'Sixth Sense 2' they could give Willis a string vest and a bazooka?",Null,0,0,20 January 2002
Final Destination," I Died Too.
","This was supposed to be a great movie.It follows the exploits of a bunch of absolutely typical American teenagers [the girls are beautiful,the boys handsome] who narrowly escape death on a plane when one of them has a vision of the impending disaster.But Death won't be cheated,and it sets out to claim them back.What we have here is 'Alien' without a monster;it picks them off one by one in a variety of satisfying ways,but ultimately we feel cheated by not seeing its dripping fangs.The movie is heavy on visual cliches too--i lost count of the 'running away from large explosions in slowmotion' scenes!If you are foolish enough to watch this movie,be warned; you will be two hours nearer your own death by the time its finished.",Null,2,3,3 November 2003
Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope," Sci-Fi Wallpaper
","There are three possible reasons why people would like this movie--#1]They saw it when it was first released and it reminds them of their youth #2]They have only recently became interested in Science Fiction and are unable to differentiate between good and bad #3] They are of the modern 'short attention span' generation who require constant action and cannot be bothered to deal with difficult or challenging concepts. Star Wars is NOT Science Fiction; it is at best Space Pantomime, and at worst Science Parody The plot [?] can be written on the back of a bus ticket; Princess is kidnapped by evil aliens and is rescued by mixed bag of freaks the villain [boo hiss he's behind you!] is a tall geezer with asthma who wears a crash helmet. Contrast this with 'The War Of The Worlds' [better acting,stunning effects,better story]or 'The Terminator' [ditto,and it was truly HARD sci-fi] and you will get my drift! Sorry to rain on your parade Star Wars fans but only gets 5/10 P.S The robots were rubbish.",Null,0,0,25 January 2002
Contact," Nice Try
","I first saw part of 'Contact'on TV a year ago but only saw the whole movie tonight,so at last i feel qualified to comment on it. First off the initial sequence 'pulling away' from Earth is extremely unrealistic-then we cut to the young Ellie Arroway [later played by Jodie Foster]-played by a girl who bears no resemblance to foster at all! It gets a little better when the aliens send an encrypted message --don't you wish just once they would send a message saying 'Hi,this is what we look like,we'll be there shortly,get the beers in'. The message contains plans for an alien machine[this idea ripped off from the 1950s movie This Island Earth] which eventually transports Foster to another galaxy. The whole thrust of the movie is spiritual and Foster seems incapable of projecting ANY emotion, let alone deep ones! Trying to think who should have played Arroway,i thought of Whoopi Goldberg [spiritual, integrity, character] but i guess that would have been too radical for Hollywood. Anyways, we get to the 'space travel' scene copied from '2001' but worth seeing again,and when Arroway gets back nobody believes her! Unless i missed something, theachine is still working so why didn't she say 'if you don't believe me.take a ride yourself'?",Null,1,3,21 November 2002
