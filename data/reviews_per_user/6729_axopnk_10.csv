The Longest Yard," Pretty good in some parts
","I don't know if its just me, but Adam Sander movies are getting pretty redundant. His comedy, along with the whole teen phase thing just isn't selling right now (compared to Vince Vaughn, Owen Wilson, Ben stiller comedies).On the bright side, Adam isn't the only one. Jim Carey is getting pretty dry himself. Anyway, this movie is a solid 5 because there were definitely some funny parts in the movie, but not everywhere. The movie starts off pretty good, with Courtney cox and Adam getting in a fight (by the way, David arquette is a lucky guy). From there the movie picks up into prison which is funny on some parts but not everywhere due to some of the issues prison inmates face, as well as other issues. I have to admit, i wasn't laughing when Adam was physically assaulted in prison. But it still was funny with the secretary and the try outs of the inmates. Toward the middle of the movie the comedy was still fresh, but than it started dealing with issues like racism which i have to admit is pretty extreme for Steve Austin to even do. The actors were cool though because of the wrestling stars and NFL icons used in the movie. Hunger's character was weird, he didn't have any motivation to do what he did to his fellow inmates but yet you still hate the guy for what he did. But what does he get out of it? His character didn't really have any advantage by telling the warden or guards any info. You would think the warden would cut him a deal like he does with Adam Sander. The low point of the movie though is when caretaker died. I was expecting something like just throwing rats inside the cell or something funny or stupid, but a bomb? that right there is too extreme for a comedy. When caretaker died, it felt like you shouldn't be laughing anymore from that point on. You wanted Adam to take legal action or something else besides just play football and beat the warden. Even when the classic rock and roll music hit at his grave side you didn't feel like 'yeah we should kick the wardens ass'. You felt more like mourning for the guy besides just thinking about football. I know adam tried to give a inspirtaional speech but hey, if a buddy just died, you probably wouldn't start cheering when they give you your uniform. The problem with this is the movie went from a comedy to a drama in 5 minutes. Don't get me wrong, it was still a comedy after his death but it just didn't feel like it, or you just didn't want to really laugh at all. People are probably asking 'well it's a comedy, so don't go to hard on the story line' but hey, don't throw in any drama in the movie. If you look at wedding crashers for example, the friends got in a fight, which happens in life and it can be repaired. But owen and vince didn't DIE. Death is something that can make comedy go from funny to serious in no time (Good example is chazz in wedding crashers at the funerals, it was written so that it wouldn't be funny at all, and you get that feel with owen looking at chazz and wondering what he just done). The football game itself was standard feel good story of the year type. Rob Schneide made his cameo to get the crowd rolling again (lucky he was in there too), but it didn't sum up the movie or leave you with heart warming satisfaction that everything would be OK from that point on. Of course there in a prison, but come on, this is a comedy not a drama. The part with the warden wanting to shoot Adam was once again like a drama and you felt like Burt Reynolds was going to jump in front of the bullet in slow motion saying no. It just ended off strange. so the cons beat the guards but so what? Adam is pretty much done for the rest of his life (didn't resolve that issue) nor did it resolve the issue with the guards (you know there's a price to be had). Overall the movie was a solid 5 on the comedy, but it was just hard to laugh on concepts like racism, abuse, death etc. Sure it was set in a prison, but too many issues presented in the movie.",5,0,0,15 January 2006
Alexander," Would have been good if it was a HBO special
","I'm only giving this movie a 2 because i thought that the structure of the movie would be perfect for a HBO special that went strait to video/cable instead of theaters. This movie really wasn't that great, it's kind of hard to give it any credit at all. The first problem withthis movie (and the most major) is that it had an all star cast that ended up doing a mediocre job at best. This might have been OK for any of their career's earlier but at this stage with there star power, they simply didn't deliver(which shows Hollywood once again, like batman forever, that an all star cast DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK) Oliver stone also did a horrible job with the action sequences, too much concentration on emotional aspects instead of the raw battle energy of troy or lord of the rings(like the whole red vision idea with the elephant fight was pretty horrible). The fights seemed unstructured and way to complicated. It was hard to figure out what Alexander was doing in the first fight, then to skip in between from macedonia center to out was strange. It didn't really explain how Alexander defeated a army much larger than his(as in reference to military genius wise). Another problem is the story was too long in order to get to any fighting (which by my count is only 2). Oliver was trying to look at Alexander the man, focusing only on his character. The problem with this is you can pretty much figure out what kind of man Alexander is: 1 He's gay, 2: has a dream, 3: takes over most of world, 4: had mother influence, 5: liked his father. That pretty much sums him up, although it got interesting with him go crazy, they took to long to get to that stage, and took too long to get out of that stage also. Secondly, was the timing of the film. It didn't flow nicely, you would cut into him as a kid, then him grown, a tragedy hits and next thing you know your viewing him 9-10 years earlier before that happened. Too much jumping around isn't great for the audience, especially after a major event happens (which the audience is waiting for what's going to happen next)only to cut back into his earlier years then zoom forward(once again oliver trying to focus on Alexander's past and character, which already has enough depth). Val kilmer surprisingly was the best character in the whole movie, nailing down the father/king type perfectly. Angelina Jolie on the other hand did a decent job but the scenes with her in it could have been cut down drastically while still getting the same effect, emotion and motive out of the conversations with Alexander. Jared leto just didn't fit well in this movie, something about his face and voice just didn't give him a great role in the movie. Rosario Dawson did a decent job, can't really complain about her because she didn't have much of a role to begin with. Collin Ferrell basically did a horrible job, (then again when does he do a good job?). Oliver really tried to push Collin to be a power figure like Mel Gibson of brave heart but also a leader role such as Russell crowe from gladiator. Collin's voice sounded whiny, he didn't have much of a look of a someone great, he seemed to put to much emotion into lines. Let's face it, certain actors do great in historical events (such as Mel Gibson, Russell crowe, Eric bana, somewhat on brad Pitt and Orlando bloom ((although kingdom of heaven was the same deal of trying to push a actor who doesn't fit the power figure great, still that movie was 10 times better than this.)) Orlando bloom easily could have been a better Alexander than Collin Ferrell. Anthony Hopkins is the same deal as Rosario Dawson. Not much of a major role so no complaints. Overall this movie seemed like something out of a HBO special, which could have done well if it was a HBO special. Unfortunately this movie had to much expectations to follow a great hit like troy. In the end, this movie just isn't that good, so don't waste your time (2 hrs and 47 Min's is another complaint, way too long) or your money.",2,2,4,13 December 2005
Closer," Be true to yourself
","I think the big thing this film portrays is the word 'Sacrfice' (i think i read that somewhere in tag lines etc.). For those of you that want to side with one character, it is somewhat difficult because each character has their flaws but definitely Clive owen and Natalie portman's is the easiest to side with and her lines really portray what love is all about. Its not about saying 'i love you' it also takes sacrifice even in situations when you don't want to. Best analogy is it's all about give and take. If you give to much the other person gets smothered while you are left unsatisfied. If you take too much you are seen as selfish and the other person feels unloved and abused. In terms of Natalie portman her flaw throughout the movie was pretending to be someone shes not instead of being true with Jude law strait up. Her good points though, as stated, is she truly does know what love is all about. As Clive Owen said, she may be young but is definitely deceitful (meaning more mature and older for her age). At the end of the movie she learns the lesson that she should have been honest with Jude and also should have been true to herself (she knew he was cheating but choose to ignore it). Jude law's flaw on the other hand was believing in love at first sight without really looking at what matters: the inside. If you think about it, he loved Natalie portman first off but later saw Julia Roberts and immediately fell in love with her to the point where he was willing to risk someone who actually cared for him because he thought it would be better. Later as he is with Julia he lies to himself to believe that she would never cheat on him (even though she already did so with Clive Owen) but eventually his love begins to fade. Jude laws character is interesting because he is conflicted by his own nature. In the end he learns that he was deceived by both women (Julia never truly loved him as much as Natalie, yet Natalie deceived him by being someone else). The lesson he learns is sometimes its better to have one in the hand then none at all as well as the phrase 'love is blind'Julia Roberts character flaw was not taking a stance and choosing to give up a good marriage for something that she felt. She essentially lied herself into loving Clive Owen initially instead of just 'getting it out of her system' with Jude law. Of course she didn't want to disturb Natalie portman, but again that's Jude's fault for convincing her to believe it would be OK. For her, she should have took a stance against getting with Jude law for her marriage sake and for Natalie's sake. At the end though she learns to take a stance and becomes the bigger person and goes back to Clive Owen to retry her marriage satisfied.Clive Owen's character i found really no flaw. He's the rule of 'for every action there's a reaction'. He loved Julia, saw something in Natalie portman but was willing not to do anything to disturb his marriage. It's only later that he actually has sex with Natalie but only because Julia's actions (plus they were already separated).Basically in a breakdown of sacrifice, Jude's sacrifice was to not give into his emotions but love Natalie portman regardless because she gave love. Natalie's sacrifice was to be herself even if people may not like who she was rather than living a lie with someone who gave no love. Julia's sacrifice was to preserve her marriage at all cost rather than gamble with someone who truly loved her. Clive's sacrifice (which he did correctly) was to try to repair his relationship even at the expense of never having something he wanted:Natalie portman. Overall the movie is about being true to yourself. Don't stick in a relationship if your not sure. Don't love someone who loves someone else. Many of the characters don't want to tell the truth but the truth will eventually be revealed. Be truthful to a person but don't let it get to the point where someone will be hurt. If your gonna do something, break it off initially, don't wait. Most of all, for every action you take in love, think about what future consequences may be. 'Love can be right or wrong'-Bread 'Make it with you'",8,2,3,6 December 2008
The 40-Year-Old Virgin," Wasn't that good
","You gotta give a hand to Steve carnell and Paul Rudd for trying.Unlike other movies, comedies are usually hard to rate or sum up when there really good (like wedding crashers) but easy to criticize if there bad(like this movie). The movie started out with a good concept, and progressed pretty nicely, but by the middle of the movie, i felt like the comedy just ran too dry. Lets face it, Steve carnell doesn't have the star power or comedy laughter of a will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn. He did have his moements, but after a while he seemed whiny and irritating. Paul Rudd tried to help his buddy out and did a pretty good job when it counted but thats only because he acted like he did in anchorman. Otherwise than that, he didn't have much comedy elements to work with (the whole breaking up thing got old kinda quick). Another problem of the movie is the progression, just too slow to get to the end, lets face it, comedies like this should only go about an hour and half or and hour and 45 minutes at best. The movie went way to long, and you knew that when he met 'the one' that they'd have a big fight. Unfortunately it took to long to get to that fight, which made you think 'why is this movie still going?'. The ending was strange, really really strange. You knew by that point that Steve needed some help, but he didn't get it (whether by the actors themselves, or by him being to independent, i don't know). Probably the biggest shocker and disappointment is the fact that they had no other comedians in the movie. Usually in movies like wedding crashers, when you think the comedy is about to get old, they throw in will Ferrell or some comedian to get you rolling again. This movie desperately needed a will Ferrell, or Vince Vaughn to make a cameo appearance to spice up the movie. Don't get me wrong, this type of comedy has really taken off since zoolander, dodge ball etc. But Steve just couldn't cut it by himself. Overall not that great of a movie.",5,5,10,12 January 2006
Resident Evil: Apocalypse," Pretty Good
","This movie is not that bad. I saw the first one but it didn't really live up to it's expectations. This one is much better than the first. Of course not everyone will agree because it's hard to please both movie goers and video gamers. I like the fact that most of the movie had some type of reference to the original games (expectation on the first resident evil video game). There are some differences between the game and the movie but overall it was still enjoyable. Millia Jovovich was alright, although i don't like that they made a non character of the game as the main 'bad ass' good guy er girl. Jill is a major character that should have been the main focus. Olivera was alright, he was like a reference to chris but he wasn't great, he was just well... there, at least he was in resident evil 3. Jill Valentine was the best actress in the movie, (one word cleavage). Not only did Sienna look good (damn she was hot, never heard of her till now), but she played Jill Valentine to a T. I even read that she studied jill from resident evil 3, she even moved like her. The second person or i guess 'creature' that was awesome was Nemesis. Nemesis reminded me of Terminator in a way, just plain bad ass. Some of the bad elements though was that the movie didn't flow perfectly, some things were just plain weird and there was some plot holes. I think the only thing i didn't like to much is they just threw the people inside the movie without explaining their origins or overall depth. Like Jill, she just runs in the police stations shoots zombies and thats pretty much it. I thought at the grave she was going to say ' i've encountered umbrella, at a mansion on the outskirts of this city'. But of course that didn't happen. The only character that really had depth was Alice. Another thing, why did Dr. Ashford bite the main bad guy? He wasn't even a zombie, he just got shot!? Overall though an enjoyable movie in some respects, other respects it was OK. Good rental but don't know about a buy.",6,0,1,20 September 2005
Home Alone 2: Lost in New York," Mediocre
","First of all i'm not going to comment on the first home alone. It was a great movie in all respects. The second one though, gets pretty dry. Don't get me wrong, it had its moments, but the concepts were over done. The first plus i do have to give the movie though is how Kevin got sent to New York. Mistaking one person for another is pretty believable since he's a kid. But from that point it was pretty average. The mom screams again and Kevin is alone in new york having the time of his life. The problem is this really doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In the first one, he was like OK somethings up but at least he's in his own environment/city. In the second one a 'normal kid' would be pretty scared since hes in a city hes unfamiliar with (Then again Kevin isn't a normal kid is he?). So once again he creates mischief which was funny on some parts (rob Schneider and the rest of the hotel staff was pretty funny) but throwing the burglaries again got kinda old. Going through the house with traps was getting pretty ridiculous. The first one had traps that were pretty harsh and you would think like alright, maybe a grown adult could keep going but in this one it was like BullS***! Getting hit in the head with a brick from that height would kill anyone (which is pretty funny if you stop and think about all the misdemeanors and felonies Kevin has committed). The problem with this sequel is the producer wanted to up the stakes and make it better than the first, unfortunately by increasing injury degree of the traps made it seem disbelivable. Another point is the bird feeding lady. So what? Kevin gives her a turtle dove, how is that really going to help her? Of course it was a family movie so she was like 'Thank you' but seriously, he just helped a major toy corporation from getting robbed, he gets a grip load of free presents, free hotel stay but he can't seem to think that money isn't something a less fortunate individual wants right? (Which reminds me, it really tried to make taxi cab drivers or low class individuals seem dishonest, scary and basically a stereotyped image of what you see in the media.) The robbers were still there classic selves, but they seemed to be just bodies in the movie who get beat up, the movie didn't really give any new angles or character depth to them. Probably the most irritating part was when buzz was doing the whole drum thing on Kevin's head, with everyone laughing, but when Kevin retaliates they get mad at him?! Is it any wonder why he will grow up to be a misled youth. Your supposed to feel sorry for Kevin, and you do, in both movies, but this one went to extreme. He's the black sheep of the family, the one everyone picks on but the movie doesn't give a heart warming satisfaction that Kevin's family will be OK from that point on (which is probably why the producer bailed out on home alone 3 with Kevin in it). Overall the movie was average in some parts, irritating in others, funny in other parts and pretty much unrealistic in other parts of the movie.",7,2,3,26 January 2006
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice," The Good, The Bad, The Ugly
","The Good:1. Batman-Although I consider Christian Bale to be the definite Batman (thanks to Nolan etc.) Ben Affleck did a good job as a older, bitter, jaded Batman. The fighting was on point as well. 2. Superman-Henry Cavill beefed up more for this movie and continues to be a pretty good version of Superman. If you liked him in Man of Steel, you'll like him here. 3. Wonder woman-Gal Godot is a hot Israeli chic period. Her as wonder woman? Great. She has a foreigner accent to give her that needed mysterious Amazonia aspect and her music has a cool tribal feel to it. She also was very tough on screen. Out of all the new DC movies, her individual movie (set in WWI) is the only one that looks promising (as long as Zach Snyder doesn't have any input...). 4. Batman Superman fight-gritty, brutal, cool. Nuff said. The Bad: 1. Batman-For most casual movie goers, they may not know who batman is. He is a man on the verge of becoming a criminal himself but what separates him is his moral code and the promise to his parents. Here? He uses a gun. And he kills. I've always liked Batman because he was smart enough to defeat his enemies without resorting to a gun or killing. If you've watched the dark knight, he says 'I only have one rule'. He was referring to him killing people. Joker wanted him to kill because that would cause him to be one of them. But despite the pain, Batman endured. Here? Nope. He kills with the same weapon his parents died to. Guess Joker won. 2. Batman superman fight-We all waited for it but superman fans will be a little irritated that the man of steel looks so mortal. So incompetent, So unprepared and so inadequate to deal with Batman. Also, this fight was under developed. They didn't have to fight each other 3. Justice league-although I like wonder woman, her character was forced in. She didn't need to be there. She didn't add anything to the story. The email message from Batman was forced too. First, how would Lex even know the symbols (Flash's lightning bolt etc.) of the justice league? Last, Batman has always been the loner/rogue member of the group. Doesn't make much sense that he'd be the one to bring them together.The Ugly: 1. Doomsday-looked like a bad cgi lord of the rings troll. Final fight was a big cgi fest, fast pace and completely takes you out of the movie. 2. Lex Luthor-'the red capes are coming' 'ding, ding, ding'. Jesse Eisenberg was a idiot/mad scientist which is different than any other version of Lex who is a smart, calculating villain. This Lex was trying to be a semi joker rip off. 3. The storyline-confusing, convoluted, messy. Biggest thing is things DON'T MAKE SENSE. Don't believe me? Think about the following: a. Mercy follows Bruce down stairs. Bruce says, I was looking for the bathroom. She says OK. THAT'S IT. Wouldn't mercy instead show him where the bathroom is at? But for the sake of moving the story along, she leaves allowing Bruce to set up the device. b. Clark follows Bruce downstairs. Clark kept hearing a conversation going on between Bruce and Alfred. He follows, get's distracted by the television then leaves. OK I get it, he had to save a little girl. BUT a better story writer would have him confront Bruce to find out what he's doing, maybe find out about the device which would cause Clark to start investigating Luthor himself. BUT because it's Batman vs Superman they have to fight each other. I guess they can't work together first then maybe 2 movies later fight. It means more when you care about what the characters have gone through, grown together but come to a place where they disagree. c. Final point (believe me I can keep going) Superman goes underwater to get the kryptonite spear. He almost dies coming back come. Few scenes later? He flies full speed WITH the kryptonite spear towards doomsday. No effects whatsoever from the kryptonite. Overall the critics were right...which is sad.This movie could have been more. In fact Zach Snyder didn't have to do much. WB as a whole didn't have to do anything. Why? Simple. If they've watched the Justice league cartoons, Batman superman movie 'world's finest' it would have been great. They literally could have just transported that to the big screen and it'd be successful. The writers understood the characters which is why it worked. Zach and WB as a whole could have set up something great. It should have been a worlds finest adaptation. Simple, concise, easy to follow.",1,2,10,27 March 2016
Fantastic Four," Not bad but not great
","I have to agree with someone else who posted the board that this movie was not as good as X-men or Spider man but it wasn't as bad as the hulk, daredevil, punisher etc. The Good: First of all the good points of this movie is that the human torch and the thing were portrayed perfectly down to their comic versions. Human torch is cocky/funny(which is why he kinda gets along with spider-man in the comics) type. The Thing was also well portrayed down to the suit they used (why didn't they use that for the the hulk?). The Bad: The first person i'd have to comment on is mr. fantastic. Now the person who played as mr.fantastic did a good job as the character. In the comics mr.fantastic was more of a scientist than a fighter which is the problem. Mr.Fantastics power sucks period. It's not very cool, it's not very effective, and it doesn't have that 'whoa' type of deal like looking at superman or spider man. Second person was invisible women. I have no problems with Jessica Alba at all, shes attractive and a pretty good actress. The problem is her age. Sue Storm is supposed to be older than her brother (human torch) but Alba looks younger than Johnny! I think the director or casting crew could have gotten someone more older and a little more well known (gwenth or someone else) but hey, invisible womens powers were pretty good and you can't beat alba stripping down to bra and panties The Ugly: The major problems of this film is first the forced love story and dialogue. The love story felt really artificial and planned, with no type of emotional attachment nor development. I don't think anyone cared that much about Mr. Fantastic getting with invisible women. Secondly is the use of powers. I know someone is probably asking 'how can you fit all of those powers onto one screen though?' well take a good look at x-men and there's your answer. We don't really get a good feel of all of there powers until the end of the film which seems really rushed. It seems that the director/writer couldn't think of a intelligent way to get all of their powers to be 'special' in one way or another to stop doom. Finally is Dr. Doom. Yeash. He did not seem very menacing and seemed to have no purpose at all at the end of the movie except blow stuff up. He was also supposed to be very intelligent, but man the actor who played him had horrible lines 'sue lets not fight' 'i'll get to you in a second' horrible. overall a good film, definite rental and possible buy but don't except to be knocked out like batman begins.",4,0,1,13 July 2005
Click," Not one of the best sandler flicks
","As i wrote in other post (40 year old virgin) certain comedies are just not selling right now. Adam Sandler comedy right now is more miss than hit due to its lack of new comedic elements in his movies. This movie was hard to predict. It seemed like a comedy in the beginning but toward the end it left you with more of a drama than a comedy. Sure, sandler tried to throw some comedic elements throughout the movie, but as the movie progressed, it's pretty apparent that the comedy just ran dry. Another problem is the movie just was too serious towards the end. Sandler didn't learn from his previous experience of making the longest yard that the problem of having a tragic event happen or too much drama completely changes the mood of the movie. Even throughout the movie, not all the jokes left you on the floor laughing. Sandler's constant characters of being a jerk, loud mouth are getting pretty old. Kate Beckinsale was OK, she had somewhat of a role but not enough to really show her talent (why she signed on, i don't know). It's hard to believe that a all star cast (most of the characters were from his other films) could do a miss job like this. It was pretty predictable toward the end of the movie that he would 'wake up' back at square 1 to get that classic Hollywood ending. If you want to really laugh and see something original, watch wedding crashers or the vince vaugn, ben stiller, owen Wilson comedy. Otherwise, check the reviews and other comments before watching anymore Adam Sandler, Jim Carrey, Jack black movies.",3,2,6,1 January 2007
V for Vendetta," Excellent movie
","Excellent films like this don't come around often. I have to say that i rank this as another 'sleeper hit' movie, similar to Batman Begins. Let me say that the end results is equally satisfying as batman begins. I have never read the comics or known anything of this series until i watched this movie. I must say that this movie really keeps you on the edge of your seat, mixing a perfect amount of action, politics, story, background etc. I think one of the greatest assets of this movie is the after effect. You feel like becoming involved in your community, politics, or basically just making a change in our world. It gives you a special kind of satisfaction that one man or ideal can make a difference. Even if you don't feel these incentives, you definitely will learn something out of the experience. Specficially you probably want to investigate or search for more background information about the movie or comics, and this even leads to a little history lesson about who Guy Fawlkes was. There is a lot of underlying messages in this movie, which i will not get into because they are different for different people (deals wtih the past and present political issues). Anyways on to the cast. First off i have to give proper credit to the wachisoki brothers, i have to admit i didn't except them to do such a excellent job (come on, the last matrix's weren't exactly grade A material like the first one), so for them to do such a great accomplish deserves credit. Natalie Portman was stunning as ever, in both talent and looks (She can still shave her head and look good). Her acting was top notch, and really brought the character of Evey to light. This definitely was another one of her greater actress talent movies compared to her Queen amidala days. A lot may wonder why they didn't choose Kira knightly seeing shes already British. For me i believe Portman is a much more established and experienced actress than Kira, but who knows, Kira Knightly is definitely on the rise. Evey's character was refreshing and also was not so one dimensional like queen amidala. Evey had to deal with a lot of her own issues which i thought was very realistic. V was awesome in all respects. He was intelligent, smart, funny at times, and plain bad ass when i came to fighting. Evey moment he was on the screen he was intriguing and mysterious. You wanted to keep watching to find out any more information of V, he's ultimate purpose, his motives, intents etc. A lot of questions were definitely answered in the movie, which kept you satisfied. But, as stated before, after the movie you probably will try to get more information on the story itself as well as V. I think the greatest aspect of V is that he gave the audience both an ideal or represented a symbol but yet still gave the satisfaction of action. The detective (Finch) was excellent in this story, and also was not a one dimensional character. Evey person in the movie, whether good or bad had to make their own decisions and deal with their own issues before taking action. The dictator was very menacing, and the whole society felt very dark and real (like batman begins) which really gave it a realistic feel and something that all of us could relate to (due to our past convictions and fear of the future). As stated before, a lot of issues were in this movie that even deal with current issues of today that could lead to a part of tomorrow. Overall this is definitely one of the best movies of 2006 and is highly recommended to everyone.",10,3,7,19 March 2006
