The King's Speech," Amazing movie
","I wasn't sure what to expect when I went to see the movie. I love Colin Firth and know he always gives a great performance. Colin Firth and Geoffrey Rush make the movie. Those two give an outstanding performance and are paired up so well. I am so happy Geoffrey Rush was nominated for an Oscar because he deserves it as much as Colin Firth. Not so sure why Helena was nominated for best supporting actress. I would see the movie again, I was sorry to see it end. The historical aspect of the movie is outstanding. We forget about that time frame and what it meant to the world. Living in the US we don't see the Brits as emotional people and it was nice to see that the monarchy does have feelings and they are real people.",10,1,5,6 February 2011
