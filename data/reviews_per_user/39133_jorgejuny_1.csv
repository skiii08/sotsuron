It," Not that good...
","Okay, let's start with some pros. The Kid's in this Movie REALLY do save the Movie from being a complete disaster. Next, the Directing in this Movie is really amazing. The dark tone makes People Feel more scared.Now, Pennywise/Bill Skarsgård is a huge letdown. From his Voice and his attempt at being scary. When the Classic Georgie scene happens Pennywise's eyes go cross-eyed which makes me laugh at the scene more than Feel Shocked or scared. This one isn't the Fault of Bill Scarsgård But more of the Script Writers. Once again just like 1990 adaptation they Don't explain the backstory of Pennywise (at least for chapter one). They do explain the dancing clown part of Pennywise's name. (SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER!) When Beverly gets kidnapped by Pennywise, Pennywise puts on a show for Beverly Showing off its dance moves.Mullet Mullet Mullet Mullet. Yes, I'm talking about Henry Bowers. Henry Bowers kills his Father as he was manipulated by Pennywise.Overall CGI was poor acting was alright and casting was okay 4/10.",4,2,7,18 September 2017
