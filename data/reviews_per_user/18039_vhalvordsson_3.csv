The Incredible Hulk," The not so incredible hulk movie
","When i was a kid i really liked it. But then i grew up and watched it a second time and the incredible hulk movie really wasn't that good.so brucei bruce looks a lot different then he did in the Hulk from 2004. Wonder why and he now resides brazil, he does whatever then hulk does except he doesn't wanna be the hulk. So he tries to control the rage within him and after failing to do so the army comes they try stopping him, then hes back in north america tim roth is here being abominationanyway they fight tim then he dies and the try to tease the Leader as a new villain but yea this movie sucked",3,0,0,4 April 2020
