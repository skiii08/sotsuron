The mask makes him into wild man with super powers and wild desires. He meets the woman of his dreams who is a girlfriend (Cameron Diaz) of a mobster and gets in trouble with the mob and the police.

Ghost," Good romantic movie.
","Jerry Zucker directed Ghost is the same director as Airplane! and Top Secret! with his brother David and Jim Abrahams. At first the writer (Bruce Joel Rubin) of Ghost was afraid, that the director would ruin his vision the way he want the story on screen. The writer was surprise he had the same idea about the plot. This movie is the first time that Zucker try a more serious story to direct. Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg make excellence performances in this picture. If you like Ghost, another movie I can recommend to watch. My Life (1993) with Michael Keaton and Nicole Kidman. Made by the same writer as Ghost but is directing and Zucker is producing the film.",Null,1,2,18 January 2002
Lifeboat," One of Hitchcock's masterpiece pictures.
","***Possible spoiler*** Through this movie it is one setting in a lifeboat out at sea. The movie is well acted in the movie you will never get bored watching it. In a Hitchcock movie there is always a chance that one will get murder in plot of the story. The personalities of the people acting in Lifeboat make the film. I don't know if Hollywood would remake this classic film, but it would be hard to image who act in the movie today.           *** End of possible spoiler***   A definite movie to watch when it comes on TV or to rent a your video store.",Null,5,7,26 June 2002

Carl Weathers is the has-been golf player who discovers Gilmore's gift of smashing golf balls, Christopher McDonald plays the annoyed golf champion, and Julie Bowen plays the public relations expert that Gilmore falls in love with.

I do not know how many times I saw the film, but never bored watch it.",Null,1,1,27 January 2002
The Others," A very mysterious film.
","The Others is something different seen of a horror film of today, but it is same style of film seen in the 1940's, 1950's and early 1960's. The film doesn't have blood and guts all over the scenes. It is good because the film lets you use your imagination think what is next instead showing things in the plot of the story. I like to watch older movies even older than I am. This film reminds me of how used to made way back before my time. I highly recommend this movie.",Null,0,0,27 May 2002
Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones," The special effects are awesome.
","I try to make sense out of the plot, but it has no substance in the film. The actors did their job of acting in the movie, but the tale was too flat. The special effects are wonderful, nevertheless the story needs more work to grab my attention.",Null,0,1,13 June 2002
Forrest Gump," One of the best films to watch.

"Monsters, Inc."," I enjoy see this movie.
","I think that Pixar is getting better by the movie with the computer animated images on the screen. Monsters, Inc. the movie is a creative way to make light of a kid worse nightmares about monsters. Children and Adults will enjoy the simplicity of the story and the lifelike animation in the movie. This movie is going to last the test of time.",Null,0,2,3 November 2001
The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring," Enjoyable epic feature.

Grease," Sing-a-Long with Grease.
","I watch Grease today on a movie screen with lyrics under the screen at a downtown Philadelphia theater specializing in an unique showing of films. I have the twentieth anniversary copy on tape of this movie, but it would not be the same without an audience. I enjoy watching Grease on a big screen and singing with people seeing the film. The first film do Sing-a-Long was Sound of Music with subtitles for the songs, so you will not miss your cue to sing. I hope somebody an idea for Sing-a-Long other musical movies titles such as Oklahoma and the King and I. It could put old films in a new light.",Null,1,2,10 August 2002
Cast Away," Modern day Robinson Crusoe.

Lilo & Stitch," An unique Disney animated feature with Hawaiian background.
","I don't remember if Disney use Hawaii as locale before in their animated films. I am a big fan of animated movies especially the ones made by Disney. This film uses the old fashion way of drawing instead of using computer animated images used in Toy Story and Monsters Inc. It is refreshing to see this type of hand draw cartoon art not dying out. I enjoy watching Lilo & Stitch and highly recommend for families. Disney did not loose it touch, but the story is reflected for the times.",Null,1,1,23 June 2002
The Usual Suspects," A film need to see a couple of times.
","I first saw this film in the movie theater when it was first release. The Usual Suspects is a type of movie you see, but the plot moves fast and dialogue has a lot of hidden meanings you need to see it twice. There are five guilty people and rounding up by the police for a line up. The police are trying to find Keyser Soze but not who he is or look like. There are so many twists in the plot it is hard to catch them all. It worth watch more than once.",Null,0,1,15 March 2002
Liar Liar," A role well suited for Carrey.
","Jim Carrey plays an attorney who promised his son to be with him on the son birthday. The son made a wish that Carrey cannot lie for 24 hours.

This sign is part of Hawaii way of life, otherwise I though the movie was very good.",Null,0,0,1 September 2002
K-19: The Widowmaker," A movie that makes you think.
",Harrison Ford and Liam Leeson star K-19 about the Soviet first nuclear submarine and directed by Kathryn Bigelow. It took 28 years to tell the story about the submarine. During this time it was around the Cold War when America and the Soviet were not so friendly to each another. My father was serving in U.S. Army on reserve just in case World War III would had happen. This one of the causes that would result in tragedy for U.S.A and the world. The plot was told through the Soviet point of view than the American. I though it refreshing to see the situation from the country of origin where the take place. I recommend watching the movie for understand history at the time.,Null,0,0,28 July 2002
A Bug's Life," Good for everybody.
","A Bug's Life does not have a good plot as Toy Story 1 or 2. Kids and adults will like the animation of the movie, and the simple story about a horde of grasshoppers of freeloading on the ants. The ants need help defend their colony and Flik hires flea circus performers to help. The first Pixar to feature hilarious outtakes at the end of the film.",Null,0,0,5 January 2002
Toy Story," The cartoon that started it all.

Toy Story 2," Better than Toy Story 1.
","The toys are back and better than ever. Where the first Toy Story left off, the second does a superior job of continuing the story. Geri of Geri's Game is feature in a small part in this movie, and making jokes about other movies are also pointed out. I read a recent article in a entertainment magazine that Pixar may make Toy Story 3 in the future. It would be nice to see, how they top off Toy Story 2.",Null,0,1,6 January 2002
Some Like It Hot," One Billy Wilder's best directing features.
","Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis are playing two men running from the mob, and disguising themselves as women in a female band. To top it all off, Marilyn Monroe is the woman that both men fall head over heels. Billy Wilder is only director, I can remember making fun of the St. Valentine's Day Massacre in a movie, but without mocking the characters in the plot. The movie is tasteful done and a has creative more story line compare to todays movies.",Null,1,1,14 June 2002

The Shawshank Redemption," A movie worth watching again.
","Tim Robbins plays innocence man send to jail for his wife's murder. Morgan Freeman plays his closes friend in jail and forming an unlikely pair of buddies.

This movie does more that entertain, it make you think how something is planned.",Null,0,0,13 January 2002
Bruce Almighty," I don't think the movie is offensive.
","Bruce Almighty is a good movie about God without saying about a certain religion. It is a comedy that makes you think of God in general sense of his power over man as well as the universe. Outer space lasts forever and so does God. Never reaching the end of time and space. To sum the movie up, I like it.",Null,0,1,7 January 2004
Signs," Not as good as Sixth Sense.
","I enjoyed the movie in spite of the mixed reviews from people on the IMDB. Signs has some references to Spielberg and Hitchcock through the film and put them to good use in the movie. It was interesting that Shyamalan using a former religious man as the main character in Signs. In the movie it make you question your own faith reflected how the character and family feels. Each director bring some to the movie that reflects a life experience his life and religion is a part of Shyamalan's experience from his young school life. He is being compared to Spielberg, but he has an different style than other the director out there. Shyamalan is one of a kind, in the future he will be consider a master at his craft.",Null,0,2,18 August 2002
Speed," One wild ride of a movie.
","Speed is one of the best action packed movies in the 1990's. Keanu Reeves and Sandra Bullock are excellence as Jack the cop and Annie the bus passenger with Dennis Hopper as the madman. The excitement in Speed keep on rolling to the end. This movie almost reminds me like a roller coaster, that you will not want to get off after the ride is over. It could be an idea for an amusement park ride.",Null,1,2,7 July 2002
Amélie," Beautifully made.
","Audrey Tautou plays Amelie a do-gooder who change people lives around her. She found love for other people, but will she find for herself.

Suddenly when she found a tin box full of a person's memories in her apartment, Amelie wants to return it to its owner. She get inspired doing good to make people happy, when the owner got the tin box and remember his childhood. The dialogue is in French, but there no need to explain what is Amelie thinking or feeling. It is self-explanatory through her innocence presence in the movie. The title character is well interpreted in the movie who is she and where she is from. This is a rare gem in the cinema today. Well worth the effort to watch the film.",Null,0,1,8 February 2002
The Sixth Sense," A interesting triller of a film.
","The Sixth Sense is the most unusual film that I had seen the movie theater. Now since it release on video and DVD, I see the movie four times already.

The movie is a funny way of reminiscing about the 1980's, through the music and the inventions of the era. The part I liked in the movie was when Alexis Arquette dressed like Boy George sang 'Do You Want To Hurt Me.'",Null,0,1,17 January 2002
