Ford v Ferrari," Art of story telling
","When I learnt about the back story of the movie, the most curious thing was who will play Enzo Ferrari. Although I was slightly disappointed with his characterization, I cannot find any other negatives about this movie. From start to finish, the story flows naturally with the two leads and the support cast (who were brilliant).",9,1,2,27 November 2019
Joker," Too realistic!
","Alright, forget about the hype and remember that this joker is not from the comic. This is the journey of Arthur becoming joker in a very realistic world, may be too realistic sometimes. The two constants in the movie are Joaquin and Hildur (music) and they have done brilliantly. The convincing writing conveys how a so-called normal, moral guy can change into a monster. The laugh, walk, the foot tapping, the stairs, the elevator and other detailing in every frame is very effective. Although, I felt suffocating at times as I never really got into the movie's rhythm. Brilliant movie to watch in the theaters with Hildur's music. Although, if you listen carefully you can hear Hans Zimmer!",9,1,1,4 October 2019
