3:10 to Yuma," A rare movie that approaches a Classic
","For decades now, the Western movie has migrated into the genre gone into outer space. In itself, this isn't bad as Star Wars and others took the concept off-world.Westerns still existed, but they took on the milieu of the spaghetti flick or preachy political correctness that demeaned the underlying theme.3:10 stands alone in several ways: First, it's one of those rare events where a remake is actually better than the original. Secondly, the Western moral theme is done with such subtlety that its gradual development within the characters appears like a ballet.Direction and photographic style was excellent as was the acting. Timing worked like the ticking of a well tuned pocket watch. Artistry such as this hasn't been seen since 'High Noon.' What else can I say, other than my wife and myself were totally swept up... and she doesn't even like Westerns.A must see.9 out of 10!",9,1,4,10 November 2007
Lost in Translation," A movie for those who love to suffer silently
","Am I missing something?I love Bill Murray, and Scarlett Johanssen is maturing into one of the better new stars, with a delectably 'human' shaped figure and expressive face.  You have solid direction and cinematography displaying a tapestry of Japan's pop culture.  Maybe it was a poor plot that failed to inspire.  No, couldn't be that, because there was no plot to speak of.Without giving away whatever plot outline there was (because an actual plot was non existent), Bill Murray was the cliched rich guy who long ago settled in to a married life that was depressingly mundane at best. Scarlett Johanssen played the very bored, bright educated young woman who seems early on, to have surrendered any personal direction in life.  Rather she chose treding time as an appendage to her vocationally preoccupied equally young husband.  In short... a future divorce waiting to happen.These two environmentally alienated people meet in an unfamiliar environment and slowly grow on each other.  It seems that neither can sleep, probably because deep down, they realize that life is ticking by like an old regulator clock with a broken chime.  In some ways, you might say that Bill Murray's character sees Scarlett as the embryo of his present existence. Scarlett bonds to Murray for a taste of her own developing life drama.Yeah... so what.  If you're a teenager with limited witnessed time on earth, all this might seem intriguing.  But in fact, if you strip 'Lost in Translation' of its Japanese environment and planted it in Chicago, or Atlanta, or Boise or anywhere else, it would be crashingly dull.Funny Part: The Japanese hooker.  Earlier funny part: Long winded director of a whiskey commercial.Tasteful Theme: No gratuitous sex.When the film was over, my wife and myself scratched out head, because there really wasn't an ending in the true sense of the word.  But then again, there wasn't a beginning or a middle either.For very good acting, direction and cinematography, I give Lost in Translation a generous 6 out of 10.",6,0,0,25 September 2003
"I, Robot"," Isaac A Would have liked this movie with his popcorn
","My wife and myself have just seen 'I Robot' and really enjoyed it.Who cares that it was only inspired by the immortal short story.  It was certainly far better than 'Independence Day' and the dirth of other indifferent sci-fi movies that have come out over the years.  The premise is very solid and the re-concept has substance.While the movie had violence, it wasn't gratuitous and there was no gratuitous sex to boot.  You have a solid premise, some excellent visual effects (and we are not people impressed with CGI), some excellent twists and nice acting.I Robot doesn't use an 'Independence Day' appeal for human patriotism to mask poor acting and execution.  It doesn't manipulate your emotions like 'AI'.  And unlike AI, it doesn't have a conclusion designed to make you feel stupid if you admit to its disconnected ending.I won't begin to give you the plot. It would reduce your enjoyment.  All I'll say is that to appreciate this movie, you must love sci-fi, have an understanding of human nature and appreciate graphics that work.7 out of 10 for a movie, but I gave it an 8 because there are so few decent sci-fi's around and it's a genre that we love.",8,2,5,17 July 2004
Jarhead," The Military Hollywood Style and Ripoff of Full Metal Jacket
","I've been in the military for almost two decades now and have never seen a more ridiculous representation than this foolish but somewhat entertaining movie.This movie is little more than a poor ripoff of the excellent, well acted, finely directed 'Full Metal Jacket.' That's really all there is to say other than the fact that the Hollywood kabal has struck again in its attempt to denigrate American soldiers and portray them as a bunch of savage morons.As an aside, have you noticed that since the terrorist attack of 911, the media folks on the left coast have been too cowardly to produce a movie about Arab terrorism? They are now held up as as innocents exploited by America.Maybe they're afraid that one of them will place a bomb in their autos. Or just maybe, they feel that they can make more money in overseas sales by denigrating a military that has been the historical guarantor of their own liberty and right to be irresponsible.6 out of 10 because I managed to sit through the whole thing.",6,3,5,14 March 2006
Ocean's Eleven," Disappointing. The theme is dated.
","Maybe because I'm not a 'Rat Pack' lover, but I found this movie to be one of the most over hyped of the year.  Its concept is very dated.  Visual effects are good, but have no basis in reality.  My wife and I usually leave a movie theater and wait two hours before discussing a film.  If it still has impact on us, it rates a 6.5 or higher.  The only impression we got from this remake was annoyance over its smarmy aura and use of implausible continuity.  We rate this a generous 4.0",4,0,1,24 December 2001
28 Days Later...," Frightening Sci-Fi without the need for an FX boost
","I'm normally not a fan of British Science Fiction, although movies like Night of the Triffids ranks among the greats.  28 Days Later is not 'great' but it really is very good and even plausible.In an age where aliens from outer space can get a real boost from modern graphics, the strength of this movie rests in our fears of biological destruction through viral mutation and species jumping.  AIDS and possibly SARS are the results.  And maybe it's this very plausibility that makes 28 Days Later truly frightening.This is a low budget movie, but the grainy film and use of on-hand weaponry really works.(Spoilers) Improbabilities?  Only two:  Western soldiers are the least likely to act like undisciplined rapists under pressure and a shot in the stomach by a 5.56mm NATO round is a good deal more difficult to recover from than it was made to appear, even with the best of medical care.I was quite surprised to see the IMDB ratings based on demographics. Beginning with the 30-44 range, opinions went down.  Given the very mature theme of this film, I can only conclude that it's potential for reality hit them very hard.",8,0,0,4 July 2003
K-19: The Widowmaker," Das Boot with bad Accents... But you dont need subtitles
","Before purchasing this DVD, I checked with IMDB and discovered that people 45 and above were the only ones to give this movie more than an okay rating. That's all right.  I'm over 45, have a military background and am very familiar with the history of the Soviet Union's first nuclear sub.With that said, I must tell you that this film is really very good.  Not being of the generation that needs Cerebellum based FX electrodes to enjoy a film, I emersed myself into a true reality flick.One of the most common and childish criticism of K-19 seems to be that Harrison Ford had a lousy Russian accent.  Well, have your high school teacher give you an 'A' for linquistic analysis and go to the head of the class.  But it's really irrelevant.The acting was excellent, particularly for the well casted and numerous second string crew.  (SPOILER?) Sorry boys and girls.  There wasn't a nuclear explosion to blow up polar bears, melt the ice flows and drown New Jersey.  But a graphic visual of a 'China Syndrome' isn't really what makes this movie taught and filled with emotional depth.  Reality doesn't work that way and this movie was very true to life.It's sad that so few people have a military background anymore. They would have appreciated the impact of military people working together to battle the chill of catastrophy's creeping hand.  The sense of patriotic duty (opps, did I use a term that's on the politically correct banned word list) combined with self sacrifice was very real.  Barring some theatrical reshaping of history, the story was true to what actually happened.Like other movies that are coming out now, the viewer is expected to have some level of historical literacy to fully appreciate the drama.  That so many lack this knowledge doesn't say much for our educational system.K-19 The Widowmaker is a first class historical drama played out during the most dangerous of cold war years.  It's action packed for the historically literate, giving a good taste of the military ideal and the meaning of honor.  I give it a 7.1 out of 10.",7,3,5,10 March 2003
Avatar," A visually Stunning mix of Starwars, Aliens and Dances with Wolves
","My wife and I just saw this and were blown away. The visual effects are masterful and the 3D gimmick actually works well for a movie like this.The theme is not original, but who cares. The movie just sucks you in. Picture it as 'Dances with Wolves,'... future world. You have that sappy 'noble savage' stuff combined with hostility towards the military, but the sci-fi fantasy mix works.We went to see this flick with more curiosity than belief that it was really that good. But early on, the acting and direction was so good that it was apparent the movie had potential. But oh, those visual effects really were spectacular.Throw in Aliens and Star Wars concepts and it's a well done, winning combination that holds your interest. Time flies and you walk away exclaiming 'wow.'",8,4,10,22 December 2009
The Matrix Reloaded," So who Really Cares
",My wife and I just got back from seeing the new Matrix.  What a disappointment!You get to see the human city of Zion.  Most everyone there is black. Few whites or Asians and they are mostly old or goofie.  The fighting heroes are mostly black also.  Not bloody likely based on my experiences in the military.  And everyone dances to jungle drums played by a Reggae band (no kidding).  How 'PC'Agent Smith (one of my favorites in the original) is a rebel program but just goes around trying to kill Neo and replicating himself for some unexplained reason.The vaunted car chase in the movie is about twenty minutes long and becomes tedious.  All FX.  Comes nowhere near the reality chase in the French Connection although it might satisfy post pubescents.Has a cliffhanger ending that leaves you saying 'who cares.'Caryl and myself are both sci fi nuts.  We'll watch any crap of this genre. Caryl gave the new Matrix 2 stars out of four.  I give it a low 2 1/2 stars for old times sake.  Wouldn't even buy the DVD.***** out ot 10 and generous at that,5,0,0,24 May 2003
Signs," Terrible rip-off of War of The Worlds for the politically correct
","My wife and I love science fiction movies.  We are such fanatics that we bend over backwards to find something nice in even poor examples of the genre.  So today, in spite of some really bad reviews, we trecked over to our neighborhood theatre to take in the first show.While I am a Brooklyn New York kid, my wife is the first off an American farm since 1710.  This is important, because the director obviously has no knowledge whatever about farm life, even in an upscale area like Bucks County, Pa.Essentially, this badly done rip-off of War of the Worlds takes place in a rural setting.  Our alleged hero (played by Mel Gibson) is a widower who lives with his younger jock brother (played by Joaquin Phoenix) our hero's two children and two German Shephard dogs.  They see crop circles, extraterrestrials, blah, blah, blah.With that said, everything falls apart, so much so that the audience around us laughed several times at the absurdity.  And we live in a very upscale neighborhood where males bend over backwards to display their feminine side to get dates with yuppie women.In the first place, no farmer lives in a rural area without the benefit of at least a shotgun.  And few if any farmers are vegetarians.  And there was no livestock on this large afluent farm... not even a chicken.  And farm children don't come out with remarks like 'aliens are vegetarians because their brain develops better (Sorry Mr. Shyamalan.  You may be a Hindu but there's no place in the cinema for preaching your vegin philosophy).'Even the two large German Shephard dogs are passive.  When they sense a threat, they p**s on the kitchen floor and attack the children they love so much.  Boy, whoever wrote this rot doesn't know German Shephard's very well.The only male image is a macho female police officer.  In the entire movie, she is the only armed person.  But in keeping with passive dogma, no firearm is ever drawn.Throughout the entire movie, the men elicit expressions of cows in the pasture and never come to the defense of anyone, including the children. Even without firearms (highly unlikely in a rural Pennsylvania setting), they never pick up a kitchen knife or even a broom for defense.  They just stare blankly and hug the children when threatened by aliens.  Come to think of it, they clutch the children tightly, placing them as shields.  Maybe they hoped their vegetarian children would grab a kitchen fork and defend their beleagured home.There were other 'progressive' cliches also, but one really sticks in my mind.  A recruiting Sergeant (a Sergeant First Class to be exact) and the only soldier in the film is portreyed as a moron.  And the only person enlisting in his office looks like a retarded ax murder on the run.All in all, this film was an exercise in sucking up to every progressive special interest group.  But as for science fiction, it will go down as dull, improbable and a waste of time.This movie deserves a '0' rating for robbing the audience, but we had a good lunch afterwards so I'll give it a '1'.",1,1,2,10 August 2002
Munich," The Answer to Violence is Surrender
","Munich is a fine piece of excellent acting, fine directing and first class 'progressive' propaganda. It's worth seeing, just as long as you keep aware of what's going on.Don't be fooled by the fact that the Director and Screenwriter are of Jewish background. The Director (Spielberg) is a notorious supporter of the dovish Israeli 'Left,' and someone who wants to disarm the American people with the exception of government employees and his own bodyguards. The screenwriter has stated on more than one occasion that the nation of Israel should not exist.I'm Jewish myself as well as an American Reserve officer holding the rank of Lieutenant Colonel so I guess nobody can point and claim that I'm an anti-Semite. But more than anything, I'm an American who knows what's needed for the survival of the world's democracies.This movie is very well done and as with all well done propaganda pieces, the underlying themes are slowly revealed in the later half. These include: (A)Arab terrorists just want a little understanding. (B) Israeli's are a cold hearted bunch of efficient killers. (C) The only claim that Jews have to their biblical homeland is their ability to take it from the misunderstood Arabs (although few Arabs lived their prior to the late 1800's and they were mostly tenant farmers for Ottoman Turkish absentee landlords). (D) Finally, the most all consuming philosophy: 'Violence is never the answer to violence.' And with that last bit of nonsense, the movie ends and you are left to wonder why America fought the American Revolution, World War I, World War II, etc. You are left to ponder whether anything is really worth fighting for because everything is relative and there is neither good or bad. There is no difference between violence or responding to violence for self-defense or national survival.How could such a well made movie make one feel so empty! Maybe because in spite of all it's violence, 'Munich' is devoid of any sense of direction.",6,1,5,30 May 2006
V for Vendetta," 1984 and Phantom of the Opera with PC Shlock
","Where do I begin? 'V for Vendetta' is a fun movie, with an annoying aftertaste that gets more pronounced as you leave the theater and begin the walk home.I never read the book. I don't believe that a movie must stick to the dogma of the book that was its inspiration. It's a movie, with liabilities and assets that don't necessarily work in both mediums.It should be noted that as a right-of-center libertarian type who believes that the United States is the last hope for maintaining liberty in the world, I view things from a particular perspective.I like the concept of fighting for freedom in a repressive society. I'm not against the concept of using violence to overthrow tyranny. I don't mind borrowing themes from different movies and books. And I think that Natalie Portman is maturing into a decent actress. I don't even mind the occasional cliché, even if it pokes fun at my wonderful United States.But you know... you can't base a movie on clichés and political correctness. And that is exactly what the core theme of this movie is all about.I don't believe what I'm about to say involves spoilers and apologize if it inadvertently does, but in this flick, the villains are Christian males of European extraction, hereafter referred to as 'Pale Faces.' The film takes place in England. The United States is a warmongering trouble maker who has screwed up the world and the British Torries are a bunch of authoritarian tyrants who have turned Great Britan into a police state.In England everyone is a 'Pale Face,' because they have expelled or killed everyone else. Naturally, the expelled Arab Moslems, West Indians and Africans were total innocents. They were in no way responsible for the violence, drug dealing and terrorism that apparently made the 'Pale Face' majority kick out the Labor Party and vote for Torry fascists. And the British Labor Party (renoun for passing anti-free speech legislation and firearms confiscation laws) has passed from the scene.But wait folks, because it doesn't end here. Homosexual 'Pale Faces' have been forced back into the closet and the Koran has been banned because it is a tremendously beautiful and profound work of art. Naturally, nothing is mentioned of the Bible where the Book of Psalms is generally considered to be one of the best done prose ever written. That goes well with the rapist pedophile Christian clergy that support the tyranny and are even in it's government.After all, we know that Moslem clerics are universally peaceful, never condone violence, believe in free speech, religious freedom, strenuously object to honor rapes and slowly sawing infidel's heads off like turkey legs.The only thing omitted to make this skewed scenario complete would be to have a few Jewish Doctors harvesting the organs of illegal aliens for sale in Tel Aviv. But I guess that would be too much, even for the Worchowski brothers to capitalize on. And by the way, I'm a practitioner of the Jewish faith and a military officer, so get over it.What a world! What a world! This is definitely not Kansas anymore.Up from the ashes comes a 'Pale Face' hero in a mask. But wait a minute. He's not really a 'Pale Face,' because diabolical genetic engineering has morphed him into a scarred and mangled 'any man' (or 'any person' if you wish).Natalie Portman gets her head shaved, truth and justice reigns and it can be assumed that ethnic drug dealers, terrorists and illegal aliens are invited back into England to restore civilization under a Socialist Labor government.Somebody give me a break.",6,2,3,2 April 2006
