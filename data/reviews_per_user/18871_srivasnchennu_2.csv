Requiem for a Dream," On Hallucinations, Highs, and a Haunting Score...
","Unassumingly titled, 'Requiem for a dream' more than justifies its interesting name. Tracing the interconnected lives of four individuals, it tells a dark, tragic story of their down slide, as they fall prey to their addiction to drugs, trading in their dreams for a dirge instead.In a seemingly benign summer, Harry, Marion and Tyrone, all recreational drug users, weave dreams of a better, and legitimate life, attempting to make a fast buck by pushing drugs. But their habit slowly but surely takes control of their lives, inexorably pushing them to the brink. In parallel, the story also focuses on Sara, Harry's mother, rendered to devastating perfection by Ellen Burstyn. Sara, a widow, in her utter loneliness, begins to take weight reduction pills in preparation for a supposed guest appearance on a TV show. As her dependence on the drugs in the pills increases, so do her insecurity-induced delusions, stemming from a fear of societal rejection. Eventually, in the climatic winter of their despair, the characters, each in their own way, tumble to irreparable depths of self-destruction. The beautiful, yet eerie background score that permeates the movie adds to its sheer visual intensity, leaving the viewer inwardly hoping for an unrealistic, yet better turn of events. Ending on a black note, Requiem For A Dream sends an ominous message about the power of addiction.",8,1,2,18 February 2005
Finding Neverland," Touching, mellow, and worth the while
","Almost definitely certain to quite surreptitiously lead to the formation of at least a lump in the throats of even the most stoic, 'Finding Neverland' does an excellent job of tugging at the heartstrings, and pleasurably so, with no perceptible trace of melodrama.The famous Peter Pan himself takes backstage, as the events leading to his conception comes alive in this well-crafted story about the struggling playwright J.M. Barrie's creative process, and his muse, the Davies Family. The relationship between them, and in particular the young Peter Davies, develops in bursts through the movie, as J.M. Barrie scripts his play drawing from his experiences, which culminate in the joyous and climactic zenith of Peter Pan's opening night. Inexplicably, the audience, and we, are drawn in to the fertile imagination of the playwright. As it comes to an end not on bed of roses, but rather on a bittersweet note, the best notion one could probably take away from this movie, is that perhaps dreams, however surreal, are worth having, if only for their ability, at times, to alleviate reality.Johnny Depp delivers a commendable and understated performance, and is done justice by the whole cast, recreating Victorian turn of the century London for the viewer, in all its grandeur and social mores.",9,7,10,4 February 2005
