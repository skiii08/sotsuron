Requiem for a Dream," I didn't know whether to throw up or applaud
","I had never heard of this movie before, but when I saw it on the IMDB and saw the high rating, I had to see it.  I went ahead and just bought it and I am not disappointed.  Wow, I have never seen a movie like this one before. I have never done drugs, and I will definitely never start after watching this movie.  After watching it I felt like I had been beat up and smeared through a sewernever felt that way before after watching a movie                       ****May be Spoilers****Requiem for a Dream is a very disturbing and dark movie.  The camera angles show some of the oddest and most unique point of views that I have ever seen.  It is nice though to watch a different kind of movie that does not have to tie up everything at the end and make you feel happy.  A movie does not always have to have a happy ending.  About half way through the movie you can tell that things are just not going right for them, so I at least expected to watch them go down their dark paths.  I felt sorry for the four characters as they were sucked into insanity/darkness/hell, and wished that things would turn out alright, but I knew better  If you liked this movie, I suggest that you watch Ladri di biciclette - 1948 (The Bicycle Thief).  Don't ask me why, but they both have the same kind of feel of being a great movie but depressing at the same time.  They are different plots and different times, but both of them make me feel a little depressed/panicky/anxious/pity.  I gave this movie 10 out of 10.  I just think it is has unique camera angles/point of view, great acting, good plot, and directed so well that it is worth watching at least once, if not twice.   The DVD has deleted scenes and a commentary on the making of the movie, as well as more.  The DVD menu for this movie is also very unique.  When I first put it in I was getting upset that I could not get my DVD player to work right, I thought maybe my TV was messed up also.  You have to watch the DVD to understand what I mean.I suggest you go watch it, but it would not be a good movie for children. If some of the scenes were not so graphic (particularly the sex scenes), then it would be a good movie to show to children/adolescents as an anti-drug movie.",10,0,0,21 May 2003
X-Men," Brings back childhood memories
","I thought this movie was great.  I grew up watching the X-Men cartoons on Saturday mornings and playing X-Men on Sega, and I was happy to see that the movie stayed fairly true to the comic book characters. 
There is plenty of action in the movie and lots of cool special effects.  I had to buy it has soon as it came out on DVD.  If you have not seen it yet, what are you waiting for??",9,0,1,15 May 2003
Identity," I need to watch it again!
","Identity is a psychological thriller that really kept me on the edge of my seat.  I figured out who the killer was about half way through the movie, but then some twists were thrown in and I thought it was someone else, and then I thought it was another guy....etc.  My initial thought on the killer was correct but I was never 100% sure who killed who.This movie reminds me of Sixth Sense in the sense that when I left the theater I was in shock and wanted to talk to people about it.  If you have not seen this movie yet, go see it and really pay attention to all the details.  I am going to have to watch it again so I can better understand it.Great movie!",9,0,0,15 May 2003
X2: X-Men United," I was on the edge of my seat!
","I normally believe that sequels are not as good as the first movie, but I believe this was better than the first X-Men.  The new characters are great and the very first scene is so cool.There are so many special effects that I never got bored and was always entertained.  I will not say much because I do not want to give anything away, but I thought the ending was very good and followed the cartoon series that I used to watch.  I can not wait until the next X-Men, I am sure I won't be disappointed.",10,0,0,15 May 2003
