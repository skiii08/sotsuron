The Blair Witch Project," Boring as hell
","It's a sad commentary on the state of film that people are willing to christen anything that is offbeat or different as the great white hope of the film industry.  This movie has made gobs and gobs of money, has probably made the people involved richer than they could possibly have imagined, but this is not the great movie that people want to believe it is.  It is extremely boring and depressingly unscary.  There is absolutely no excuse, in my mind, for the mind-bogglingly crappy way the film was shot...things are out of focus, it is jumpy, and much of the time the film is either completely dark or the shot is of trees or rocks while action is happening elsewhere.  I realize it is supposed to be a documentary shot by amateurs, but there is no reason to put the audience through that for some arty notion of what is 'realistic filmmaking'.  A 60,000 dollar budget doesn't mean you end up with 'Clerks'. Usually you end up with a crappy-looking film, which is exactly what the money bought here.",1,6,11,6 August 1999
The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers," Excellent, of course, but bothered by some changes
","As everyone knows, this movie is excellent.  Eveyone will see it and say so, and it's true.  So I'll stick to only the few things I didn't like and not the many, many more things I did: 1) The effect of Pippin and Merry riding Treebeard looked bad, very bad. 2) The 'everyone thinks Aragorn is dead' subplot was an unnecessary departure from the text. 3) Like some earlier reviewers, I felt that the change to Faramir on a fundamental level was a very poor decision.  This is a guy who the audience is supposed to like, who is supposed to represent the good in Gondor.  Now all the audience will have is him, Boromir and later Denethor to show them what Gondorians are like, and the picture won't be pretty.  I mean, why should we root for Gondor when all their representatives are greedy, ill-mannered and sometimes insane men?Anyway, kudos to Peter Jackson for another fine cinematic experience. Please try to be nice to Faramir.",Null,0,0,19 December 2002
Blade Runner," Intelligent Sci-Fi
","There are people out there, I know, who are interested in Sci-Fi for the way it can incorporate larger issues into its limitless potential.  These are the people for whom movies like Blade Runner, 2001 and Solaris are made (12 Monkeys is also worthwhile viewing).  These are the people who don't ever go to Sci-Fi conventions, who've never dressed like Chewbacca (except maybe at Halloween) and who don't know what Spock's wife's name is.You have to be prepared to be awed when watching this movie.  Clear your mind, start the movie, and just watch it from beginning to end.  The beauty is in all the details - in the sound the police spinner makes as it whizzes by, in the soft glow of reddish-orange light when Deckard is at the top of the Tyrell building (when every other part of the city seems to be in perpetual darkness), in the noirish yet electronic score.  The plot needs to be taken on its own terms - if you can accept the basic premises of Deckard's job, then you can be drawn into the unfolding story.  Sure it can be slow, because all good Sci-Fi is.  It needs to be slow, so the audience can think about the implications of what's happening.  If you rent this movie because you heard it was like The Matrix, and you expect the instant gratification of violence and a swift plot, you'll be disappointed.  But if you allow yourself to think about the ideas put forth during the lulls in the movie, you'll find that this movie stays with you in a way that no popcorn-movie, blockbuster ever could.",10,0,0,10 June 1999
