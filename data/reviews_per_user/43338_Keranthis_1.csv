The New World," Might try again someday
","This is a beautiful film, or rather the first hour and a half was beautiful. That's not to say that it changed after that, or that the cinematography went downhill. It's only that I couldn't sit through the entire thing. The cinematography is beautiful, but that alone cannot carry a film. The acting, what there was of it, was good. The score better. The script was non-existent. Yes, I've read the other comments here, and I can appreciate their views. Perhaps someday I'll try again and get further through the movie. It just struck me that a wonderful topic, setting, and cast were wasted on two hours of watching people walk around and horrible, jarring cuts from one moment or scene to another. Oh yes, and the grass growing. If you want to make a silent film, then do. Don't drown out the wonderful score with bad internal dialogs. There is a lot here to love, but it was drowned in a sea of waving grass and bad scripting.",3,0,4,15 September 2006
