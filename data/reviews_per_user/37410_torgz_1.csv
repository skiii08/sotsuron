Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace," Thrilling, awesome, astounding, best movie of the decade!
","Episode One - Phantom Menace is absolutely staggeringly amazing in its visual depth, intricacies and story telling.  You whoop, you cheer, you are on the edge of your seat - it delivers everything promised and then more! Incredible!  Definitely the best movie of the decade, if not longer - I will certainly be 1st in line at episode 2 in 2002!  Go and see it! Twice! *grin*",10,0,0,26 June 1999
