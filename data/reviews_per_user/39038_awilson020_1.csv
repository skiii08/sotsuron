The Lobster," Not my favorite
","I do not know if anything I am about to write would be considered a spoiler but here goes: I watched this movie last night before bed. I have seen way better and I am surprised that some of the actors in this movie actually agreed to be in it? Story aside, this film was too long and did not go into enough detail about the why and when. I have seen way better from films that were not even shot as well as this one and with an unknown cast. I cannot in good conscious recommend this film unless you want to be bored. How this has a rating of 7.6 I am at a loss to explain? I am also disappointed in how they ended the film. I think that they let it run on for so long they did not plan an ending and just had to stop leaving the viewer hanging. I think overall this story has potential in the right hands of a competent director. The acting talent was there. Overall though this was a letdown.",2,30,50,17 December 2015
