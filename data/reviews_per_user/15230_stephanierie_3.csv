Hereditary," What a waste of time
",One of the worst movie I've seen in a while. Boring and worthless. What a waste of time.,1,3,6,25 November 2018
Aquaman," Another DC Fail.
","Again Dc movies writers couldn't write a decent script. The dialogues are so stupid and pretentious, and frankly the protagonist is this big guy who never learn how to act. This movie is such a poorly thought CGI parade. Unappealing plot and such a waste of time.",4,1,1,27 March 2019
Once Upon a Time... in Hollywood," Are you kidding me?
","If this script was someone's else it wouldn't even reached theatres. I think it is boring, useless, pointless. Dialogues are...omg i cannot even say how damn boring they were...Just a waste of time. I'm disappointed I wasted my time watching it. 2/10 is too much, consider it a gift In honor of good old times...Meh.",2,4,6,10 December 2019
