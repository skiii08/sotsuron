Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan," People don't understand it.
",I found the movie very entertaining. From the reviews it seems a lot of people didn't get the joke. It seems some people can't get the premise of the film - Borat is an idiot.Now I'm 47 years old. I grew up in the cold war. I remember the Russian stereotypes. I also grew up watching British comedy shows. British humor always is absurd. A good example of an absurd British book - A Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy.I can agree in someway that some of the put ons were a bit cruel. Hopefully after they filmed they informed the participants it was all a put on.I also agree - top 250? NO WAY! Still a lot of the comments people just couldn't get it. Here's some examples of what an idiot Borat is. Just look some of the things he says; 'Home of great warlord - Premiere Bush'.'We support your war of terror'.'Give me your tears now gypsy or I take them.' He's from a backwards country that is very racist. It's not a slam against Jews. It's a slam against the racist mentality of his third world country.It reminded me a lot of the hidden camera shows where you would see peoples reactions to absurd situations.,8,3,6,29 October 2007
