The Blair Witch Project," God-Awful (possible spoilers)
","Absolutely one of the worst films ever. Saw this back in February before all this stupid hype. Artisan must be commended on one of the greatest con jobs ever on the American Public. I feel sorry for anyone paying to see this collage of amateur home movies. However, if you find bundles of twigs, rock stacking and annoying ugly actors scary and entertaining, this movie is just for you.The budget was $30,000, but one has to ask where did all the money go? Looks like it cost less than $30. Not to mention this film is a rip-off of two superior films, THE LAST BROADCAST and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST.It's popular to tear down the opinions of everyone who doesn't like this movie. If you didn't like this movie and are reading this, I urge you to send a message and make your voice heard. Vote 1 now on IMDB! Make your vote count, and show that you're not one of the mindless herd of sheep that supports this kind of amateurish trash.",1,1,2,6 August 1999
