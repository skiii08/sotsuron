Ford v Ferrari," Run, don't walk, to see this movie
",Absolutely spectacular movie. Damon and Bale were fabulous and it's non stop action from the get go. Thoroughly enjoyable movie one of the best ones I've seen this year.,10,4,16,15 November 2019
Wind River," Spectacular Movie
","Spectacular movie. It grabs you from the first minute and never disappoints. Jeremy Renner is a lock for an Oscar nomination and Elizabeth Olsen is terrific. While I though the scenery was spectacular, the writing and acting is what really drives this movie. I've heard from some people that they didn't like the violence and intensity. While this movie is intense and there are some violent scenes, it's woven so well into the story arc it's not at all bothersome.",10,2,8,28 August 2017
Legends of the Fall," It's Grown on Me
","I've probably seen this movie, in whole or in part, over twenty times and I think it's one of the finest movies ever made. That's a far cry from my opinion of it when it first came out. My wife always thought it was fabulous, but my initial reaction was it's mediocre at best. I don't know why I thought that because I loved the cast, but there was something about how it hung together that bothered me. Anyway, that's in the past. I just finished watching it and am blown away by the quality of this movie.",10,4,6,4 May 2019
Marriage Story," This Movie is Terrible
",My wife saw it last week and thought it was terrible. I watched it tonight after the Oscar nominations and could barely get through it. There isn't one likable character in the movie. The plot is terrible and it's ridiculously depressing. Avoid it at all costs,2,5,17,14 January 2020
