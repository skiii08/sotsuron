The Ring," I'm so scared.
","This is the most scary movie ever! It was so good and even a better remake then the original. Samara is a really scary Bitch! What can I say... Learn it, live it, love it!",10,1,1,11 June 2003
The Matrix Reloaded," Smart flick? Don't think so...
","I just loved the first Matrix! it was dark, smart and really excellent. I saw this movie yesterday and did not love it. Sure it was good, cool effects but nothing more. The story was so thin and the meaning of the film could be shown for 20 minutes. The only good thing was the effects. But in that scene were Neo fights after he met the oracle. It was so fantastic in the beginning but after a while it looked like a videogame. Whatever....",4,0,0,2 June 2003
