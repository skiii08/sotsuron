Howl's Moving Castle," My favorite Hayazaki movie!
","If I had only one 10 for Miyazaki's movies, I'd give it to this one! Although the story is one of the most complex ones, it really does have a proper plot from start to finish, unlike some other Miyazaki's movies which have weird endings/unfinished stories, well at least in my opinion... The visuals and the music are of course magnificent, I could listen to the soundtrack all day long... There are plenty of interesting, well-developed characters and of course Miyazaki's trademarks like an anti-war theme, flying aircrafts etc. There is a fine balance of action and ''calmer'' parts of the movie, also the line between magical and real is set very good in my opinion... I love how Howl's room is stuffed with so many things and looks so comfortable!^^ Whenever I'm feeling depressed, I like to watch this movie, especially the scenes that take place in large, open scenery like the woods and the mountains, it makes you feel very warm inside. One scene in particular always comes up first though, it's the one where they make and eat breakfast, I dunno why, maybe because the food looks so deliciousXD... Anyways, as a Miyazaki fan I urge you to watch this movie! You'll be taken into a world where not everything is perfect and good, but where friendship (and a little bit of magic;)) can do wonders!",10,0,1,31 July 2010
Sucker Punch," An almost perfect movie (which I rarely say and is a really great thing)!
","Matrix+Anime+Lord Of The Rings+Kill Bill+Sin City+Samurai/ninja+Bayonetta+Final Fantasy 13 = Sucker Punchâ™¥!Just came back from the premiere, first of all I gotta say I am soooo happy with this movie!:D I was afraid it was gonna end up being not that good... But I hoped and expected it to be this good and cool and it delivered! The way this movie was directed and the soundtrack is simply wow! It's really cool that most of the songs are a little remixed and sung by the actors themselves, Sweet Dreams sung by Emily Browning in the intro is so dark, creepy and nice! The music plays an important role in the movie because it triggers the fantasy, action scenes so it really had to be picked carefully and it fits great. I really like the visuals in the movie, the locations, the way the characters look and move and sound... The whole movie feels as if it's happening on a theatre stage... If you'vee watched 300/Watchmen, you'll notice the same shade of grey/brown and blue/green throughout the whole movie. The story is pretty good and there are some real shockers in the plot, but I'm not gonna reveal anything! All I'm going to say is if you're expecting this to have the typical action movie ending, wrong! The acting was OK, I liked Carla Gugino very much! Also the characters of Sweet Pea and Rocket seem to be the most developed...Now for the action and the effects and visuals... DROOL! The special effects are flawless in my opinion, the action scene with the 3 big samurai is seriously the best action scene I've ever seen! I really like the little touches to their costumes and weapons like the cute little anime bracelets on Baby Doll's gun! The girls did a great job with the stunts! They didn't overdo with the actions scenes, they're incorporated really well into the movie. But once they start... wow! They pretty much covered everything!:DSince I'm an anime fan, this movie is pure sex for me! The only thing I would've liked is another culminating action scene and villain, the second part of the film was a little less epic... But still, nice work not ending it like everyone expects it to end! It gave it a deeper meaning... Maybe it was even better that way... The movie is probably more a 7 or 8 (mostly for non-anime fans etc.), but I'm giving it 9/10 because of the directing/music used and the character of Baby Doll! Really I think this is the best anime movie ''adaptation'' (if such has even existed before).To summarize, GO WATCH THIS!:D You'll have so much fun! I'm probably gonna go watch it again in a few days^^...",9,27,56,24 March 2011
Resident Evil: Afterlife," The movie was pretty damn good and had some surprises, but due to the thin plot and some weird decisions it didn't quite live up to my expectations...
","First of all, I must warn you: If you're expecting Apocalypse all over again, don't! When I first saw the trailers I was looking forward to Apocalypse (which is still my favorite part) on steroids and ended getting a movie with much less super powered characters and Matrix action. If you think realistically, it was a smart move to make the RE movies more survival horror again, but I'm a huge action movie fan and expected more action and crazy stunts from this 3D movie:/... There's still plenty of action, don't get me wrong, but you can clearly see that most of the 60 million dollar budget was spent on the first and last big fight and influenced the script a lot. The special effects are veeeeeeeeeeeeery good, but frankly if you've seen the trailers and clips, you've seen it all... I would have loved to see more action like there was in the first 15 minutes or so. They kinda wiped all the sci-fi away and we were left with a not so scary survival horror movie with great backgrounds and effects and slightly above average action scenes. And you'll be shocked to see what they did to poor Alice to make her ''more human'' :rolleyes:... But all that aside, the plot is fairly simple, kinda like a RE game back in the days when graphics and character voicing weren't that developed, so they had to keep a simple story. So you could say that this movie truly is the best RE game port to the movies, but it's kinda not enough for the big screen movies when you only look at the plot itself... But hey, we've seen much worse! The acting wasn't anything special either, but frankly you can't expect more from a survival horror... Still, the actors do deliver... Especially Milla, oh I love her so much!:D And many may say they don't like the soundtrack, I love it! It packs so much adrenaline or a sense of no hope... I'm interested to see what they'll do in the next one cause this one is clearly just and introduction to something new and doesn't bring a lot of story with it, plus they've really brewed some stuff together that I have no idea how the characters are going to get away after from, you'll understand me once you see the ''ending''XD... To conclude, you should go watch this movie, but don't expect it to be like in the trailer or in the first 15 minutes... I'd still like to comment on some decisions in the movie that I find questionable, but I'd start posting spoilers then, so no...",8,10,22,11 September 2010
Underworld Awakening," While it lacks the detailed storytelling and somewhat the atmosphere of the previous entries, Underworld: Awakening is still a pretty watchable action flick.
","I'm sure everyone knows by now who Selene is... the sexy vampiress in her trademark tight lycra outfit is back! And she's deadlier than ever! At some points I was even surprised how ruthless she has become, this film definitely packing more blood and gore than the previous entries. But Selene does it with style, the action sequences being more beautiful, fluid and spectacular than ever before. The special effects have definitely evolved, loved the little particle effects present in some parts of the movie, you'll see... Kate Beckinsale pretty much is Underworld at this point because all the other trademark characters are dead or the actors have refused to appear in this one. She does a nice job but there weren't really many acting challenges in this one for her to begin with, she definitely had a harder time shooting all the beautiful stunts. Michael Ealy, Theo James (the sexiest male vampire in Undeworld for sure!^^) and India Eisley are a nice addition, though. Scott Speedman isn't in this one so the Michael parts were in my opinion the trashiest parts of the movie, you'll understand what I meant by this once you see the movie. But I blame Scott for that, he should've returned. If they ever make a fifth movie, Scott Speedman should either return or they should kill his character off and put Selene and David together^^. Although the main villains are supposed to be humans, the old vampires vs lycans war never gets old and it reverts back to just that in the end :D. Speaking of villains, there's no villain like Marcus in this one, only monsters that have to be killed off by Selene with style^^.What I disliked about this one was the fact that they've changed the atmosphere of the Underworld universe. No Gothic buildings, no vast backstories of the two clans, it just doesn't suck you into the world like the other movies did. With that said, this has definitely improved the pacing in this entry. There are no parts that drag and the story and action are simultaneous so you never get bored. Plus the fact that the movie is under 90 minutes also contributes to this... All in all, I'm glad I watched this movie and I think you should, too. They've given Underworld a new start so there's room for more movies, too. We'll see... While the first two movies are still my favorites and I miss the old Underworld atmosphere, I liked this one because I've really missed Selene so I give it 8/10 (although it probably deserves 7/10).",8,1,4,21 January 2012
Magic Mike XXL," Slightly better, than those porn movies with an actual script.
","The only reason why I didn't give this movie an even lower score was Joe Manganiello. Just bad and cheesy. It's literally like the perfect porn substitute for those overly religious ladies who are now able to go to the cinema and watch shirtless men, without feeling as guilty, as they would, if they watched porn instead. And the whole cinema was literally filled with them lol. Haven't watched the first one btw and I don't think I will. As far as I've noticed, at the start, the movie does some pretty random cuts with some characters from the first movie. What happened to Channing's girlfriend from the first movie that I'm sure he had to win over with a lot of effort? The info was pretty vague and confusing. Some scenes also make this look like a low budget erotic movie, like when only the main characters are in focus and everything around them is literally visibly blurry as hell. The story is just a ridiculous excuse for some (okay made) stripper performances. The acting was cheesy, like the characters didn't even take it seriously. The Ken character is obviously gay, just like the actor, I was waiting for him to jump on one of the male characters, the way he was watching them. :DDD The story about Joe's oversized penis and him not being able to find a woman that can take it... seriously? The random scene at the drag club? Still don't understand why they included it, it's just random. These older guys going to this convention for the last time? Cheesy... And Channing's character winning over that girl, while he's still not done with his old gf? Errr... The whole script in my opinion is just bad and random and not that logical. The only reason these movies are a hit in my opinion are the cock deprived women who go and watch them (sorry, ladies, I saw you all giggling like you hadn't seen a shirtless body for ages and I just rolled my eyes throughout the whole movie). What's worse, I don't even find these guys particularly sexy. And no chest hair! And no Asians lol! The ending with them watching some fireworks... again, random, what made those fireworks so exciting? We never get to see it. It's like a bad QAF episode ending with cheesy music. The only good thing about this movie was in my opinion Joe Manganiello's performance in the store and at the convention, fun, exciting and sexy! :D He really looks like a Greek god and his grins made it even more fun, while the others' just seemed cheesy. I dunno what to say, in my opinion, a mess of a movie.",4,8,17,6 July 2015
