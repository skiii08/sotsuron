Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," Atypical Pirate movie
","The production crew has tried to live to the expectations of the Pirate fans, but in my view the attempt is in vain. This movie becomes darker with 3D glasses, I miss the splendorous view of the blue lit ocean and green islands here and there. The story lacks the Pirate kick barely involving Jack Sparrow as the lead artist. I miss the crew, the one eyed guy and his mate, lack of the usual wit in dialogs. The sea mermaids were making the story too much of a fantasy story rather than a Pirate action movie. What's the point in selecting Penelope Cruz with so little role tagged to her, any artist could have played her role and put the hype to rest. Anyhow, it a good entertainer, but as a fan of Pirate I feel a little disappointed.",6,0,3,25 May 2011
