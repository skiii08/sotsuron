The Avengers," Everything you could have wanted
","The Avengers was a film with so much hype it was of course difficult to see it really living up to expectations. The film absolutely does and then some, wasting little time with exposition we meet all the characters fairly quickly making for an impressive feat in that the film ran at over two hours. If you have seen at least some of the films starring these characters you will be more than aware of them, but even if you haven't it is not difficult to pick up on the characters that have had their own films. In the case of The Hulk it really doesn't matter. So newcomers are welcome but some familiarity with Thor may be of preference although personally I didn't have it. In terms of the development it seemed as though there was an inevitability that some would get the upper hand. Namely Iron Man, Captain America and Thor with some coming for the Hulk. The likes of Black Widow and Hawkeye having less but still getting enough to get by, even if Black Widow's felt a little like it was produced in short bursts. Even early in the film I felt like Iron Man was stealing the show, this felt like a strength as egos can become rife in the characters if they are not written properly. Luckily we didn't have to endure poorly written blanket egos on screen. The Hulk was probably the character that stole the show throughout the entire film at least outside of the villain Loki. The Hulk was approached in a humorous manner devoid of complete seriousness from Eric Bana's and semi seriousness from Edward Norton's. The character is played in some way for comedic effect and once the Hulk is on screen he has the largest presence out of all of characters and Mark Ruffalo played it brilliantly knowing exactly what he was there for. Back to Loki, where he worked as a strong villain never quite making for a hammy comic book villain tailored for a family audience or the dark interpretation that has become typically associated with Christopher Nolan's Batman films. In terms of action it was excellent, earlier parts of the film were lacking light at all so it may be worth missing 3D. However the action later in the film worked brilliantly in 3D, especially for a post conversion. For some viewers it may bring back memories of Transformers: Dark of The Moon but at no point was it a cluster of images. The Avengers works as a film not requiring multiple things happening on screen and unlike the Transformers films the action always stayed exciting and left you wanting more. It also utilises humour in a brilliant way using it fairly frequently without reaching gag territory. All in all it is a very fun film and should you not like superhero films (because if you do you don't need me to tell you to see it)then you should just see it as it works as just a fun and sometimes epic summer blockbuster.",9,3,8,8 May 2012
Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides," A better Pirates film
","I had decent optimism going into this film as I was hoping it would be more of a back to basics Pirates film with the intention of really entertaining its audience. With the you know who characters gone this was a clean slate and right from the outset I knew there wasn't going to be an insincere dark plot that fails to get off the ground. The fountain of youth element may seem like a thin plot for a film so long but the writers seemed to remember what genre they are in. This is more of an action film with plenty of sword fights put in. However much of the action is shot in the dark which if you're not a fan of may be off putting. Aside from that camera angle wise it is well shot and doesn't feel disorientating in the slightest clearly wanting their audience to be a part of the action without methods like shaky cam. The film isn't perfect and the pacing becomes questionable towards the middle with some scenes looking as though they are repeating themselves. Nonetheless there is a decent pay off with the subsequent scenes. Onto the performances and they are mostly good. Johnny Depp, Geoffrey Rush and co are brilliant in their roles and the film doesn't feel like it is all about Captain Jack with the way it was written. He was in just enough to be humorous without being irritating, although it is all a matter of taste and I would fully understand people becoming irritated by Jack Sparrow by now. Penelope Cruz now plays the female lead and it is clear even though we haven't seen them together before that her character Angelica and Captain Jack clearly have a chemistry and their scenes together were probably the highlight. In this sense Cruz made for a much better female lead this time round and stepped into the series like she had been there since the first film. The film despite its issue with pacing at the mid point didn't feel too long and had mostly kept itself to a premium. There is nothing terribly memorable in the film which is why it doesn't get a higher rating, it simply captures the spirit without being spectacular. In summary though it is a decent Pirates film and an improvement for the series that seemed to treat its audience with more respect this time round.",6,0,0,21 May 2011
Men in Black 3," A worthy sequel
","The Men in Black series was surprisingly brought back with this film, it is at least a decent sequel and one that outperforms the second film in every sense. The film at least tries to change direction with Josh Brolin taking the role as Agent Jay's Partner. Tommy Lee Jones role in the Men in Black 2 seemed very tired and unnecessary for the character, in this it was worthwhile that Lee Jones took a back foot. Will Smith of course plays Jay and expect the exact same performance as before. He does at least find himself in a new environment as the film does bring at least some originality in taking it to a new time period where Jay goes back in time to save Young Agent K from murder. Josh Brolin does a brilliant job in the role of Young K as he actually delivers a fantastic Tommy Lee Jones impression. It does seem that it is about as close to what a Young K would be like and turned out to be great casting. There are not a huge amount of laughs in the film and it seems to be played more as an action with 'Boris the Animal' working as the best villain in the series since Edgar, although he is no where near as funny. The action is played out quite well and the effects never look too fake. While trying to avoid spoilers the film plays out how you would expect. I will say that Smith and Brolin made a good pairing and a good alternative the to the Lee Jones and Smith partnership. All in all a decent entry into the series and one that at least partially makes up for the mess of Men in Black 2.",7,0,4,14 June 2012
The Expendables 2," More of the same
","The Expendables 2 is a film that knows what is required of it but its problems lie not with being bad per Se but with how it has been written. It starts out playing it completely straight and to be fair it pulls it off slightly. It is fun to watch and at the same time tries to somewhat build a story even if its in a very ridiculous sense. The team go for what should be an easy paycheck but get more than they bargained for when one of their team dies. All of the cast are back save for Jet Li who despite what the marketing says is used to only a very small degree. Apart from this though Sylvester Stallone does at least attempt to enhance the film into having an ensemble cast save for the climax. All of them do what is expected but in my view Dolph Lundgren steals the show with a humorous performance. There is a shed load of action which is a great deal of fun and does triumph at times. To the film's credit it does not attempt to shy away from what it was always meant to be and delivers an enormous amount of action and of course one liners, etc. The problems with the film though lie in the fact that it can't decide whether or not it wants to be satirical, with some especially cringe worthy but amusing lines being used to this effect. It is almost like it is deciding it wants to take a heavy handed satirical touch late on in the film. It it however quite a lot of fun and is worth a watch, you will absolutely know what you are in for though when you see the film.",6,0,4,18 September 2012
Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter," It comes and goes
",Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter is a film that appears to either be just a title joke or a joke trailer. It is difficult to envisage a film really coming out of this. The film does bring an origin to the Vampire hunting and doesn't attempt to dump the viewer straight into the action. However the film's run time means it struggles and makes it very sloppy. We get an origin but it is again a very sloppy one. It's nothing that you didn't see coming and fails to blow you away at any point. The film simply doesn't offer anything refreshing but it is fairly enjoyable bringing plenty of action throughout. The action starts out very well but then descends into what many action films become. A particular action scene involving a stampede of horses feels like it has no weight to it. It would look spectacular in an animated film but the CGI hasn't progressed enough where a large group of animals can look realistic in an action film. It looked like a flurry of images. The film does succeed in being engaging with the final action scene making up for any loss of weight in the previous action sequences. Acting wise it is just satisfactory where the performances are decent enough. I never really quite feel the pain that Lincoln is going through surrounding his mourning but its probably because we have this sort of thing many times before. Overall the film is a decent action yarn but does not really bring anything new but does entertain for the most part.,7,5,10,9 July 2012
Ted," Supremely funny if over dependent on pop culture gags
","Ted is a film that if you didn't know it was headed by Seth MacFarlane, you would after about five minutes if that. The premise about a Teddy Bear growing up and living with a man is one that has been utilised very well. It does not hide from the fact that it is a very silly premise and does in fact celebrate it. Where the film has its weakness is where the humour is almost too synonymous with MacFarlane. A deluge of 80's nostalgia and pop culture gags reach the forefront of the film. If you do not like this sort of humour where there are references galore, some of which are a little too in your face and out of place. It depends on the patience you have for these pop culture gags. In Family Guy they can be prone to becoming severely out of place and too random to be funny. In Ted though they are, at least for MacFarlane kept in moderation. The leads in Mark Wahlberg and Mila Kunis do very well and seem completely natural in parts that would be difficult to play otherwise. Wahlberg especially stands out and gets just as funny as Ted himself. Ted (voiced by MacFarlane) is of course the stand out character, his only flaw is possibly that his behaviour is too predictable at times, regardless he is very funny and does actually provide many laugh out loud moments. Plot wise it takes very predictable turns but its just a fun comedy and I anyway at least got over the fact relatively quickly. The film is funny, its key weakness is just that the humour is effectively very concentrated.",7,1,4,21 August 2012
The Day After Tomorrow," Started well then wavered
","The Day After Tomorrow is clichéd beyond belief, ridiculous in huge amounts and full of unnecessary scenes that drag the film. It centres around climatologist Jack Hall (Quaid) who of course predicts the doom of mankind this time (movie scientists in general predictions context) due to global warming. Of course the governments don't listen and in a matter of days the world is in the midst of a new ice age thanks to a global climate shift caused by that pesky old global warming. Now Jack must rescue his son and co from the clutches of the new ice age in New York City. The film actually begins quite well with half decent pacing and plot development. It doesn't waste any time telling us what its about and pretty much gets straight to the point.Films like these are sometimes guilty of trying to sound too intelligent when face it you're around for the special effects.Those effects do not disappoint,for all the film's flaws they are brilliant and they are enjoyable every time the film is viewed. The second half does sort of rid the film of the spectacular effects and focuses much more on the characters. Okay so that isn't so bad right? Well they were quite boring at times although I did enjoy the interaction between Jack and Ian Holm's character and colleagues which was quite entertaining. Apart that it was pretty dull. There are things I can nit pick but I'm... oh what the hell what about the part when they were being chased by the ice in the New York library? If you've seen it I won't have to rip it to shreds but yes it is a head scratcher. Aside from all of these factors it is more or less satisfactory and I can't really say much else because its all it was. Overall worth watching but just not great.That is all.",6,0,0,15 January 2010
The Expendables," One liners, explosions. THE EXPENDABLES!!!
","The Expendables brings the old action clichés and aims to celebrate them as much as possible and what on Earth is wrong with that? It is easy to say this but sometimes you do just have to sit back and enjoy the onslaught of violence. I mean with a cast of Sylvester Stallone, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Jason Statham, cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnie. It gives action fans exactly what they want and lets the world know there is testosterone in the movie world after all. How does the plot play, well it involves the team heading preparing to overthrow a dictator. With Sylvester Stallone at the helm naturally he heads the group and therein lies a sort of problem. Stallone leads alongside Jason Statham mostly meaning we don't get the team fighting together as much as we'd like now usually that wouldn't be a problem as we can get more time for some form of character development. Well as much as an action film like this one will allow. The thing is I wouldn't have minded an onslaught of the entire team in combat but we don't get that as much as we would like. Regardless it is a hugely enjoyable film for action fans. The key word there people is ACTION fans, you are not going to get something thought provoking as it knows what it is supposed to do. In spite of my mild complaints about the amount of time on screen some characters get it isn't bad and allows it to build tension and come into its own and is just a joy to watch. Do we get the moments of humour we all like in films like this? Of course, do we get the implausibility where it is extremely difficult to get hurt? Of course. Possibly the aspect I appreciated the most about this film is that they did not hold back in the action and go for the lower rating, again it is giving the action fans what they want. Alright there is the shaky cam but is it still enjoyable getting past that factor? Yes it is because at least there isn't the slow motion holding up things. The characters are likable for the most part as well and you don't really need to be hit over the head in order to root for them. To conclude The Expendables works well to the best degree that the usual clichéd action movies that remind us mostly of the 'good old days' where we would make a manly salute in appreciation of action by the bucket load. Just sit back, relax and realise it won't be making a sweep at the Oscars.",8,3,9,20 August 2010
Shutter Island," Very compelling
","Contains mild spoilers.Going into this film I knew little about it merely the fact there's a mental institution and the Police are called in to investigate. However I was quite optimistic having heard some of the things that had been said about it already and went in with a great deal of optimism. I was delighted that my faith had paid off as it conjured up a hugely compelling and interesting physcological thriller that had me guessing and speculating at near enough every opportunity. With every scene brought about new questions some of them small some of them vital but every single one of them is nonetheless very interesting. The plot itself involves marshal Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck called into investigate the disappearance of a patient and then we watch it all unfold. The negatives and there are some, the hallucination sequences got quite over the top after a while after being extremely gripping at first. As well as this the score was a little much with the music more or less trying to shout at us, 'ok we understand the place is fishy.' These being said they don't detract from the high amount of positives the film offers. I feel as though I can't go into any more detail as I don't want to give anymore away the film very much speaks for itself as I was gripped for whole thing. The 138 minute run time didn't feel too long and I thought it had the potential to do so. All in all this is a thriller well worth a watch for some very good compelling viewing.",9,1,4,24 March 2010
21 Jump Street," Hilarious albeit in all the ways you've seen before.
","Looking at 21 Jump Street simply from it's promotional material it appeared to be just the typical cliché undercover cop comedy that we've seen before. Having watched it, is it? Well yes but it stands out for celebrating it for what it is and not insulting the audience. We have our two leads the good looking one and the typical nerd like fat one. They knew each other in school and couldn't stand each other, now they are friends as adults. Again not unusual in the slightest but the film succeeds in constantly throwing jokes that you don't really have too much time to notice the clichés. They go undercover the infiltrate a new drug craze in a school and inevitably they end up succumbing to the drugs at some point as well as enjoying themselves a little too much. There is of course the meta humour involved with mentions of 'an old program brought back from the 80's,' didn't get too much of a laugh in my particular screening but made me chuckle. And let's face it by the time you've sat down to watch you've only yourself to blame for not knowing what's in store. The film has decent performances from our two leads but in my opinion the stand out was Channing Tatum who just seemed to be more naturally funny in the role. However Jonah Hill's actions did bring more laughs at times. There is plenty of action and you more or less need to pay attention as there almost seems to fit in more jokes at these points to go along with the fast paced sequences. Other characters were decent and it was funny to see our leads attempt to fit in with the changed high school personalities from their days. This was where Channing Tatum particularly stood out. All in all it comes down to many things you see coming but learn to have fun with it enjoy the silliness and you may enjoy. It has beaten recent attempts at buddy cop comedies hands down.",8,0,1,27 March 2012
Captain America: The First Avenger," A solid superhero film
","Captain America is not the best known superhero but from the look of the previews this looked promising. A superhero in the Second World War can work brilliantly if done properly but can fail if many aspects aren't done properly. The film delivered an interesting look, there was a obviously a great amount of effort gone into making the film look authentic. Altogether it did a good job of conveying the look. Chris Evans was fairly well cast in the role. The scenes prior to transformation were not too overdone event though it took a little while to see Captain America in his full pomp. I do think the writing could have done a better job giving the eventual Captain America Steve more of a personality. Even though characters can easily be mild mannered he didn't feel like enough of a man to be conveyed as much of a tortured character longing to serve his country. He much improved once he transformed and it didn't feel too abrupt like it easily could have done. Tommy Lee Jones despite in a not being in a lead role did well and had plenty of moments that stopped it becoming a melodrama. Hayley Atwell was fairly mediocre and seemed to play the token woman gearing up for the inevitable romance. Hugo Weaving did a decent job with what he was given but maybe it was more to do with the character and the fact that it was difficult for him to come across as genuinely menacing. Action wise it was very good but towards the end they tended to be shot in fairly dim conditions which wasn't great, this was perhaps an attempt to add grit to the film so I can't really condemn it as many big budget films look too clean. Apart from this it was very exciting throughout and even though it was intended for wide audiences the action is good enough and doesn't look like its been trimmed in any way to get a more family friendly rating. The pacing was good and we saw just enough of Captain America to get a sense of the character as well as the back story. I would have been worried if the film was only about an hour and a half because then we would have seen a rushed effort which dished out the action at every opportunity. We really got a plot line which felt compelling and was kept at a premium. All in all it was quite a solid entry into the genre and one of the better Marvel adaptations, better than some but not spectacular.",8,2,7,2 August 2011
The Amazing Spider-Man," Familiar and contrasting at the same time
","The Amazing-Spider Man is clearly a film that wants to bring the character back to roots completely. The problem here is that the story is very familiar given how recent Sam Raimi's films were and bar a couple of characters being replaced with new ones this one feels very familiar still. The difference here is a sort of pseudo realistic approach for the character. It was never going to be a case of Spider- Man being completely realistic as he is a man bitten by a radioactive spider and given superpowers while the villain is a man who's literally turned into a giant lizard. The partly realistic approach comes from the fact that there are explanations made for the suit and the webs are not organic and are now made mechanically by Peter Parker himself. Small details in the origin remain the same such as Uncle Ben, but the film does feel fresh. We do not actually see Spider-Man until a long while into the film and while this is not an unusual tactic for superhero films it simply felt like this may have been better suited to a TV series format as it paved the way for a massive change in shift once the villain storyline in particular got going. Action wise, the film looks amazing. There is great weight to the action scenes and there does feel like tension. All the actors did a good job with a special mention for Andrew Garfield in the title role. He managed to bring back the wit of Spider-Man in a very good way and I felt as if he delivered it well. At least I didn't find him annoying in the way he could have been. All in all the film is enjoyable, it does not blow you away however with more action it could have done. But it provided sterling entertainment and actually made the effort to tell a story without over indulging.",6,2,5,23 July 2012
Mission: Impossible - Ghost Protocol," Formulaic fun
","So we get another Mission Impossible film and by this point I have pretty neutral expectations. The series has been on a see saw trend with a brilliant first film, a dire second film and a decent third. By that logic this one would return to the dire or dire like nature of the second. It doesn't. 'Ghost Protocol' certainly makes for a fast paced film that knows by now that too much exposition outside of 'your mission if you choose to accept it' is not going to down too well with an audience hungry for action and already familiar with the concept. It starts at a decent pace making for interesting viewing as we see Ethan in prison. From there on in action en sews and you don't need me to tell you too much about it. If you have seen any of these films before you'll get the gist straight away. It does make for a decent introduction and gives us our lead character Ethan once again well played by Tom Cruise. Of course it is not where the main plot takes place but rather kicks in at the Kremlin where it really starts to go down and Ethan and his team must clear the IMF's name after a bombing. When I say formulaic it kicks in at the beginning but nonetheless it is very fun. From here on in the action is well shot and to be fair there is plenty of tension. Performances wise they do a decent job, this time with four leads only really Paula Patton who was weak in some areas but to be fair made up for it in others. Jeremy Renner being a good newcomer to the series and Simon Pegg of course providing the comic relief. He was very annoying in parts, probably due to the fact he has a much bigger role this time round. You can more or less guess what is going to happen at various points but it is still a good action film. It is some of the best in the series and didn't feel too over the top. It certainly looked like they had learnt their lesson after the second film. To summarise it is decent, although by now it knows what sort of film goer will see it and provides a good enough ride for those who already know what they're getting into.",7,3,7,3 January 2012
The Bourne Legacy," Not a lot to tell
","The Bourne Legacy can't seem to decide what it wants to be and once you sort of gather what it wants to be you are quite underwhelmed. Set in the aftermath of Jason Bourne's story, the film picks up with a new agent Aaron Cross who's like Jason Bourne only he's not. The film consists of the usual people looking at large screens, using headsets trying to decipher what's going on while attempting to get the bottom of the Aaron Cross character. At least that is what I gathered from the film. There wasn't really much else to really take into account. Cross, a member of another agency (not Treadstone) requires pills all the time and needs help from Dr Martha Shearing to obtain. Meanwhile there are the computer screens as mentioned. The film's key problem is that it spends a great deal of time on exposition and pseudo attempts to explain what on Earth is going on. The trouble is that it fails. All of the flaws in the film are attributed to writing as I came out thinking 'okay then' and not much else. The acting is at least very good and Renner in particularly tries to bring something to a role that not many probably wanted. That is the film really it didn't really have much of a story to tell which is why it is of course left quite open ended, I say open ended. It is more like the film had stopped and then the obligatory cue Moby. All in all The Bourne Legacy is not bad and would probably be good for a rental as the action is very good and well shot. It just has little else to offer.",6,0,4,5 September 2012
Into the Wild," Poignant
","Into the Wild is a film based on a true story that sees a young graduate named Chris ditch the conventional and materialist life in favour of a life outside the grid alone in the wild away from his parents and his previous way of life hoping to make it to Alaska, his own promised land. In spite of this being a true story I was wary of the run time of around 2 hours 15 minutes and thought it may struggle in the pacing department. I have seen films with plots far less convoluted struggle to fill a shorter run time so with perhaps a form of prejudice going in beforehand I sat down and it was brilliant. The film does not waste any time as we see Chris living this life out in the wild right from the outset. Of course there is some exposition about his past life and again knowing that this is a true story it in my mind warranted a decent delivery. Was it a decent delivery? Well it was and it wasn't, early stages indicated promise from the storyline but it wasn't the main strength, the first act then shows promise but in my mind gets a little stale. That said there were significant improvements later on. When we see him travelling and facing the challenges that being alone and off limits gives you Emile Hirsch does stupendously and while yes there large parts of the film with dialogue such as the interaction he has with various people he meets which was beautifully scripted as well as shot especially the scenes with the hippie couple. The scenes with him alone show great ability and in my personal opinion show Hirsch's ability to play the role. Looking at through his eyes was one of the most interesting things about this film seeing really how he thinks. Taking these into account it is hard not to see why choosing this life wouldn't be a little bit appealing and this to someone who very much enjoys his conventional lifestyle. Without going into spoiler territory the film gets more poignant as it goes on, which was helped by (I am going to reiterate this) beautifully shot which fully signified why this man would want live this life. That may have ended up being one of the real difficulties with this film as it could have easily ended up being pretentious gladly it wasn't. The interactions almost matched his individual performance and it was incredible that all the actors did such a great job. My personal favourite was Vince Vaughn's performance where he was utilised and used fairly sparingly. To summarise this film does brilliantly to make the most of one man's main performance while bringing other actors in and knowing how to use them properly. I would strongly recommend it as one of the most compelling and poignant of recent years.",8,0,0,26 January 2011
Avatar," Epic
","Going into this film I personally had a great amount of optimism surrounding what I was going to see. Fortunately those expectations were justified, Avatar was as exciting as it was spectacular due to outstanding effects. It may have been the 3-D element that was the springboard for this but I was never bored by what was being out on screen. Sometimes an onslaught of special effects can end up becoming a bore and I question what on earth is going on. The end of the Transformers sequel springs to mind when I think of this.Avatar mixed the brilliant effects with a relatively interesting storyline that held my attention and didn't bring up too much explaining. It drew upon a concept and sort of modernised it making it a good spectacle. A mass of explanations would have been enormously frustrating but gladly this doesn't prove to be the case.To summarise though Avatar is massively enjoyable and a brilliant spectacle for the modern cinema-goer.",8,3,8,23 December 2009
The Artist," Different and brilliant
","The Artist came as a film that I had pretty neutral expectations going into, despite it's positive reception I still wondered simply from a personal point of view how it could sustain itself. I was pleased with how it played out. It plays out in quite a quick fashion and certainly isn't slowly paced, this was perhaps recognised by the film makers as a silent film perhaps may be bemoaned if its pacing wasn't up to scratch. When I say this I mean once I knew the plot I was surprised as to how quickly the pace got going. This was a genius move as it made for a film which didn't lag. In this we see George Valentin wonder if the arrival of talking films will cause his downfall. There is a great sense of his attitudes and as the film continues we really feel for him, while at the same time becoming immersed in Peppy Miller's story. We of course see much of hers in the form of montages which I didn't mind as despite the overall brisk running time she along with our other lead was developed, at the same time enjoying seeing her rise to fame. The two leads were a joy to watch, from Valentin's point of view we see his willing ignorance to the threat of 'talkies' without the aid of audible dialogue we see him kidding himself and the inevitable decline. On the other hand it could be said it made for a predictable outcome, once you know the plot you know how much is going to play out. However the film had a great amount of heart and was brilliantly acted without despite predictability wasn't too clichéd, hammy or melodramatic. I always think once the audience is routing for the characters the film makers are at least somewhat succeeding and it was more than the case here. Personally I thought they would fill it with a larger cast but was pleased when it was kept to a premium as well as the run time. It made the pacing stronger and kept my great interest in the story itself. To summarise it is a treat, something different and well worth watching for if nothing else great performances.",9,0,5,29 February 2012
Inception," Well shot, well written, well acted
","Christopher Nolan has impressed many a cinema goer in recent years with the rebooted Batman series but this is an original work and allows more people to see what Nolan is truly capable of doing in terms of writing. The teaser trailer utilised the score which seemed to punch the viewer in the face with the drum sound and only seemed to say to us, 'we have Christopher Nolan, come and see this film.' I must mention I feel a kind of guilt thinking that because it blew me away. Leonardo Di Caprio stars in his second great film of year as the 'extractor' who infiltrates the dreams of clients with a little help from Arthur played by Joseph Gordon Levitt who researches the targets. There are so many layers that I am simply not going into in a single review and that's the true focal point. You cannot really afford to let your attention waver as you literally can miss something vital in a few seconds.All of the acting is probably flawless as Di Caprio plays the tortured soul excellently still grieving for his wife and using his ability to control dreams to be with her, meanwhile wondering if he will see his children again. He really has stepped up and shown how well he can lead a film and did wonderfully alongside Gordon-Levitt especially not to mention the interaction between the Ariadne character. Aside from the slow motion the special effects are wonderful and not used too much (if you've seen the film you'll know what I'm talking about). It's been compared to The Matrix in terms of its action scenes and the slow motion involved which we saw in that trailer. The difference between this and The Matrix is that it feels much more natural. When I see this I mean it wasn't just done for show. Obviously The Matrix introduced it before everybody decided to put it in their films and spoof it to the degree that it becomes one of the most tedious gags to feature in any parody or spoof. In Inception though it serves a purpose and when the slow motion is delivered boy is it delivered. You are blown away by simply how they managed to film the scenes. Like I say its complex and I really would recommend watching it more than once as there are probably things I missed out on but it would be well worth subsequent viewings.",9,1,4,30 July 2010
Prometheus," Very familiar yet scary in places.
","Prometheus is just a loose prequel of the Alien and that is how I took it, the format is nothing original and if you've seen Sci-Fi about discovery usually involving an expedition it will be very familiar. The characters work pretty much how you'd all expect them to. The plot basically involves a team who discover a clue to the origin of mankind and follow it up to a faraway planet. Like I say if you've seen these kinds of films before you will simply know what to expect from them. The token freak out character who backs out as soon as he sees something unusual but has been in the mission for a long time prior. The heroine, the corporate (borderline in this case) villain and so on. They are adept in their performances but never blow away, going into this film familiar with the Alien series, you are just waiting for some of the more horrific elements to kick in. When they do kick in they are genuinely horrifying and shows that Ridley Scott really knows how to direct it properly especially with the way it is shot. The film is in general shot very well and feels like very much an epic. There are many scenes shot in the dark so the film will work best in 2D as it will supplement the feeling of claustrophobia. Michael Fassbender was the stand out performance in what was very Hal '2001' like but still fairly unique. In a plethora of stock characters he was the one who stood out and made his role his. The decision to make cast Guy Pearce as Weyland was interesting but strange, an older actor may have brought more credibility to the character as knowing who Guy Pearce is has just made it a little odd in this way. Overall Prometheus is decent but one that just becomes too stock with too noticeable plot holes.",6,1,8,22 June 2012
X-Men: First Class," Stylish prequel and a welcome addition
","When the words prequel and reboot are mentioned about the same film I get a little sceptical. I loved the X-Men series and so wanted this to be good. Gladly, this was a welcome addition and an example of a prequel that works brilliantly on many levels but also takes a few liberties in some areas. If you are very aware of the past X-Men films there are a few things that differ with the continuity that you'll be aware of. At first I was irritated by this but I realised that it it simply what happens when some prequels like this film are made. If this sort of thing does irritate you be aware of this and you may end up enjoying it after all. I sound cagey in this respect but I do want to keep this review spoiler free. Just be aware of this as there is special effort made for this film to show its individuality in many respects. The performances were all good and some very good, Kevin Bacon as Sebastian Shaw occasionally came across as goofy for a villain but showed his worth when he needed to be threatening especially once the third act came along. James McAvoy and Michael Fassbender did very well together and had a brilliant rapport. I thought it would have been difficult to replicate this given the chemistry that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen had in the X-Men trilogy. They did very well together and I really believed their friendship, that is not to mention they do well in scenes when they are not together as well. The other mutants started out fairly same old same old but came into their own at the end. Although despite their somewhat weak introductions as characters I did find myself caring about then once that climax came along. There were scenes with plenty of tension especially involving Erik/Magneto that had a great deal to do with Fassbender's performance. The action involved was consistently good and also wasn't a constant in the film where the focus was very much on the characters and it also made me appreciate the action more when it came. The action got better as the film went on and there was a genuine effort by the film makers to make a film that could be both exciting in terms of action and make it a brilliant character story. In summary if you enjoyed the previous X-Men films you should enjoy this one as it really makes an effort and the performances while not especially brilliant from the supporting characters were fantastic from the leads. These performances made me want to see McAvoy and Fassbender in these roles again. It features an amusing cameo as well.",8,7,10,14 June 2011
The Dark Knight Rises," A fitting finale.
","The Dark Knight Rises was probably the most hyped film of the summer but my oh my did it deliver. After The Dark Knight it seemed clear that this film tried to make epic in every way and for the most part it succeeds. The film starts as a huge downer with Batman out of the game and an impending attack on Gotham unbeknown to the people of the city, being in peace time supposedly. At a massive 164 minutes the film was always going to be a slow burner but it did very well in its first act. New characters Bane and Selina Kyle are introduced brilliantly and instantly at that. Bane works brilliantly as a villain, becoming intimidating as soon as he appeared on screen. This carried on throughout the film and we saw a genuine villain that is capable of physically challenging Batman in a way that we have not seen in the series before. Much has been said of Bane's voice being difficult to understand but personally I didn't find any trouble. Anne Hathaway as Selina Kyle gave a memorable performance, they did not succumb to the 'thief with a heart of gold' and turned out to be more ruthless than I expected her to be. If the film has a flaw, its that it lags slightly in the second act where we are in some parts waiting for the climax. This is made up however in the fact that the action scenes are brilliantly shot with many fight scenes being well shot as well. Past films in the series, specifically Batman Begins made the fight scenes in particular difficult to decipher what is going on. This film practically eradicates that and it becomes clear from the scenes with Batman and Bane this was intended. Elsewhere performances were strong from the likes of Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and managed to convey the emotion when they needed to. Overall the film was a very fitting finale to a fantastic series which for want of a better phrase redefined the Batman character.",8,3,8,31 July 2012
Toy Story 3," Just as good, no brilliant as the predecessors.
","After seeing all the hype and good press about this film I thought this was going to be brilliant as Toy Story is what Pixar have done best in my view. In Toy Story 2 we got a very ominous piece of dialogue about how Andy is growing up and there is nothing Woody can do about it. I loved that they went with this approach with the next film as they could have just played it safe and have Andy as an excitable child again for the third act but it all comes full circle and we finally see Andy as young man going off for pastures new leaving his childhood behind. Without meaning to sound too deep and meaningful this is something we can all relate to as we've all had that feeling of having to leave our most precious of memories behind. As an 18 year old I can relate to it now. This was an ambitious but fantastic way to round off a story that has been brilliant from start to finish. Andy is conflicted when thinking what to do with his childhood toys and a mix up makes the toys go out to the trash. After avoiding that doom they find themselves in daycare all the while Woody remains loyal to Andy as he tries to think of a way to get back to his owner and join him at college. The toys eventually find out it isn't as good as they would have liked. A theme that we saw in the first film but felt just as fresh right here and now. Again just like the other two films it is brilliantly written with many references in this case especially to prison escape films and many more to mention. We also have new characters to which the highlight is Barbie's love interest Ken to the credit of the makers made some fantastic jokes both subtle and in your face about the character. We see plenty from all the characters involved and it never escalated into farce which is something that the Toy Story films have always managed to avoid. The story also goes in a darker direction as we get some slightly more sinister characters playing the villains in this film which again is a testament to how well it is written and we also get some very emotional scenes, I won't give anymore away but if you have any emotion you'll be gripped by it! The film also avoids dragging too long and I found myself wanting more even though it gave me everything I could possibly want from the film. This is the first review in which I have given a 10 and I am completely justified as it is the most fun actual fun not just enjoyment I have gotten out of a film in a long time. Plus it gives a great sense of nostalgia and will make you want to see the other two films again.",10,1,1,27 July 2010
The Cabin in the Woods," A somewhat horror but overall semi-satirical
","The Cabin in the Woods is a difficult film to review with regards to spoilers but I'll give it a shot trying to encapsulate what I think the film-makers are trying to put across. The Cabin in the Woods is clearly a satire from the outset, in 2012, bar remakes, reboots and the like horror tends to always attempt a new turn and while watching this film I found it most welcoming. The semi-satirical aspect comes as I saw it as a film that seemed to celebrate (or make fun of) the stock characters that make up the horror films that you would consider this a part of and for the most part it is decent at doing so. The characters in this film don't seem nearly as annoying as they tend to be in these films. Maybe that is just my perception but it seemed to be a deliberate act on the part of the film-makers. The film does manage to produce some genuine scares though mostly in earlier parts of the film. A positive is that the film does get more interesting as it progresses. None of the actors tended to stand out and just seemed to do just enough to make for a decent cast. Without trying to go into too much detail, it does provide plenty of aspects that would please horror fans and does seem to be a celebration of the genre without being too meta. I will say it is not for the faint hearted and if you don't like films which try to be many things in a short amount of time this may not be the film for you. Again without moving into spoiler territory that is where I believe the film has its flaws where it does try to do too much. Overall it is a decent film and if you like horror with some satire thrown in then you should give it a go.",7,0,7,27 April 2012
Transformers: Dark of the Moon," Dark the Moon, the mediocre one
","The Transformers series started out quite strong but I knew as I watched that film that any attempt to make a 'bigger' film would end up with a clunky mess. Thus we had 'Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen' which was a terrible in parts, overly complicated and had a dull climax. For these reasons I had pretty neutral expectations going into this film where I expected action by the bucket load but more hoped to gain enjoyment from it this time. The film starts out with our human protagonist Sam played once again by Shia LaBeouf with shoehorned girlfriend Carly played by Rosie Huntington-Whiteley. The reason why I say shoehorned is because there is no introduction, they are just a couple. Of course I realise the absence of Megan Fox but after all Mikaela went through with Sam you'd think something pretty big would end that relationship. Anyway we've got two and a half hours to fill, Sam has to find a job and the Autobots must face off against the Decepticons again. The first act of this film very much feels like filler until the action comes rather than set up and that is where we get most of the 'humour' which falls flat around 60% of the time. I'm not going to get too wound up as if the film got treated completely seriously this time round it would make for a cringe inducing experience. By now though it was more of a slight distraction. Performances wise LaBeouf does a fairly good job with what he's given. Quite a good actor in all honesty and wasn't nearly as annoying as he has the potential to be. Carly, our new female lead is not very good and doesn't provide an improvement on Megan Fox. Maybe its the fault of the script but she was just uninteresting and obviously only really served as eye candy. Other characters like Simmons returned to inject little to no decent comic relief. Gladly John Turturro is a good enough actor to be in the role and not be bogged down by what he's in. Special effects wise it is mostly more of the same, the action set pieces are better set up and are superior to second film. In truth at times it was spectacular to see especially towards the end before becoming very familiar the more it progressed. This had more to do with the film's run time which again well over two hours, you do have to brace yourself for it as certainly I felt it towards the end of the film. The Transformers looked as good as they ever did and if it is one thing the film gets right is that they did look very real. The Decepticons seemed to have more of a presence this time round as there appeared to more effort put into them as antagonists. They were satisfactory but never came across as particularly menacing as they wouldn't the third film in. The film more works out as a middle ground but could never capture why the first was the best. It is superior to Revenge of the Fallen but the final action climax did very much remind me of when I was bored in the cinema two years ago. Overall though this is the mediocre edition to the series, its enjoyable on its own merits but not on a general film level. If you want to see this and enjoyed the series so far you'll probably enjoy this one. It is just simply a half decent Transformers film and an average action film.",6,4,10,30 June 2011
The Fighter," Excellent for the genre
","Many boxing films I have noticed get positive receptions and I enjoy so as you can imagine I had great optimism going into it. Micky Ward is not a household name but of course he doesn't need to be a household name for this to be a good film. The film itself was very good and the thing that impressed me was the pacing. I liked Raging Bull for example but I did believe there were problems with the pacing and sort of dragged. This film didn't and they kept it to a premium very well knowing what what was required and didn't in my view anyway have too much padding. All of the roles were played well, his sisters were portrayed in a very over the top way but I didn't begrudge it too much because they didn't have a huge amount of screen time for the characters they are.Mark Wahlberg did a great job with the understated mild mannered performance which had us empathising with the character but not in a way that felt clichéd about the humble rags to riches character that of course we've all seen before. He does well overall but I am not the first to say this but Christian Bale really does steal the show. It is probably the film I've seen him perform the best in. He plays it brilliantly and doesn't go over the top like the sister characters seem to because he plays it that well. There is an element of tragedy about the character as we see about the HBO documentary about crack addiction. He even manages to have some amusing moments without coming across as too goofy. Knowing about the sort of performance Dicky demanded I thought he may get too goofy but he manages to have some slightly comedic moments as well as portraying a flawed individual as well. Inspite of his flaws I still like the character of Dicky which could have failed in the respect of him being the sort of individual he was at least in the film. I don't know how much they changed him if at all I'm only going by what I saw. It may sound like the film is all about him and its not we see plenty of Micky Ward and the way he likes to conduct himself which ultimately isn't underplayed. It was also done well in that we do not just see Micky as a punching bag (no pun intended) for these problems. Its not as if they're just saddling continuous hurdles on him which they could have done if they felt it made it more interesting. I notice sometimes filmmakers do this in order to make the story more compelling and I don't think they do that here. They keep it interesting and not cringe-worthy. The boxing scenes were decent but I have seen better boxing scenes from films before. These served their purpose well and didn't fail at attempting artsy techniques which I really could have imagined them doing. Is it the best boxing film of all time? Probably not but makes for a very good film on its own which served up good performances all round.",8,2,3,14 February 2011
