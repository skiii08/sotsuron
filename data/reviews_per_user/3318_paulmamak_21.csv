Raiders of the Lost Ark," A true classic that introduces the world to the legendary archaeologist who takes the audience on an adventure of a lifetime
","The film opens in the dark jungles of South America, the scene is set with a mysterious person dressed in a fedora, leather bomber jacket and carrying a whip, accompanied by a party also on the expedition. This scene is given a darkened tone by this mysterious man appearing as only a shadow in the distance, which is supported by dim lighting and an eerie score. All of a sudden, a gun is drawn upon the man by one of the party members, only for the man to break out his whip and disarm him, with a crack of a whip followed by an echoing gun shot. The mysterious man emerges from the shadows, introducing the audience to the legend himself Indiana Jones.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true epic and original in terms of the adventurer genre. The opening scene with the golden idle, will always be remembered throughout cinematic history where Jones evades and escapes a number of booby traps. From then on the plot thickens, which involves Jones racing against the Nazis for the discovery of the Ark of the Covenant, a religious artifact that comprises the power of God. Throughout this conquest we see him fend off Nazis in a bar that is going up in flames, fend of Nazis in a Cairo marketplace, discover the existence of the Ark using the crystal medallion in a map room, uncover the Ark in a snake pit, fight Nazis in close proximity of a German bomber, re-claim the Ark in a truck chase and survive the almighty power of the Ark. Each scene is jam-packed full of adrenaline, excitement and suspense and will always be remembered throughout cinematic history.This film could not have been what it was without the cast members that were chosen. Harrison Ford is the only person who could have played Indiana Jones, since not only was he able to play the action adventurer, but he was also able to play the university professor convincingly and also accurately. Karen Allen was excellently cast as Marion Ravenwood, since she did not just play a damsel in distress, but also was able to undertake a bit of action herself. Her chemistry with Ford was incredible and to date they have to be one of the best on-screen couples. Paul Freeman as Rene Belloq was outstanding as the villain, his overall presence was the reason for this. He did not ever fight Jones in hand-to-hand combat, but always had his henchman do the dirty work and tormented Jones with sharp and slimy lines in the process, while also claiming every archaeological find that Jones gets his hand's upon. His piercing blue eye's and his stinging French accent also gave him more of a darkened presence. Ronald Lacey as Major Toht also played an unforgettable villain, who makes a touching tribute to Peter Lorre. Jonathan Rhys-Davies role as Sallah gave the film some humour as well as some warmth and Alfred Molina makes one of his first screen appearances as Satipo, a role that certainly proved his acting capabilities.The film is backed by excellent cinematography that is close to that of David Lean's work, an outstanding score by John Williams and production design by Norman Reynolds who designed the sets of the Well of the Souls, the Fertility Temple at the film's beginning and the Ark of the Covenant itself.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic that gave rise to Indiana Jones that will continue to move audiences of all current and future generations.",9,1,2,26 May 2008
Friday Night Lights," A journey taken where you discover the true meaning of 'Football'
","This film emphasises what it takes to win and the characters that were portrayed in this film highlights what sacrifices and obstacles must be undertaken to obtain success. This film therefore takes the subject of Football to a completely new level by not only playing it for the love of the game, but using it to obtain future success and respect.Billy Bob Thornton's role as the coach was truly one of his best acting performances seen to date. This is seen when he delivered motivating and rigorous tactics as well as inflicting moods of anger and frustration. In scenes such as at the side line during games and the speeches he gave in the locker room. He also used his character to inflict sympathy, such as when he became involved with Mike Winchell (Quarter Back) when Mike was having regrets due to the relationship he had with his mother. As well as with Boobie Miles and his uncle after his accident. He also gains sympathy for his character as it is shown the pressure that he is under in order to bring the boys to triumph. As you learn from his family that he has coached more than one team throughout his career, which has caused him as his family to locate to areas all over America. Lucas Black's character (Mike Winchell) was not like the usual stereotypical Quarter Back jock, but he brought to this role a serious role, who lived for football, but was also troubled about what obtaining success would do between the relationship between him and his mother. As the film progresses you see how his gift for football becomes more of a reality, by the way he leads the team formations as well as throwing some amazing passes to enable a successful game to be played to their advantage.Garrett Hedlund's role (Don Billingsly) depicted mainly the honour that was acquired between his successful ex-football father (Tim McGraw). Throughout the film you feel the tension between the two as Garrett's father embarrasses Garrett in front of the other football players and one of the girls he is with. Garrett proves himself to his father in the final though by continuing to play even with an injured shoulder. Don Billingsly truly emphasised the hatred and frustration obtained between cold hearted fathers and has proved his great quality as an actor.Derek Luke (Boobie Miles) deserves the most credit in this film by providing a moving performance as the star player that has to give up what he lives for 'football', due to injuring himself on the field. At the start of the film you see that he is the person that will bring the team to victory, he therefore put a lot of cockiness into his character, full of wit and energy (even a one point imitating Bill Cosby), as well as giving his character a sense of being invincible. When being told that he no longer play football you see this character going from his immortal self to the sensitive character that he truly is, in one of the most powerful scenes in the film.Despite the characters, the film was well directed showing some of the most gruelling scenes that can be experienced on the football field to scenes where little dialogue was read.",7,1,2,22 June 2007
Akira," Altogether, a good Manga film. With some excellent animation.
","Seeing that this is the first Manga film I've ever seen I thought that it was OK. Once I have seen a few more Manga maybe I will show more respect for this film.What really made this film was the animation, especially since this was made in the late 1980s. This is shown from the way that the animators were able to show a post-nuclear version of Tokyo. The action and fight scenes also depict why this film has become so popular.What to me let the film down was the overall storyline as it seemed to be too complex. As a result the characters lacked development, which to me would have made the film much better, as you were not able to relate to them to such an extent.",6,1,7,1 July 2007
Hot Fuzz," Brilliant! A true British classic!
","Taking ahold of the British Police force and using it to make an Americanized action film was genius. Pegg and Frost brought their on screen magic from Shaun of the Dead an used it once again to bring you Hot Fuzz. Moreover, they also demonstrated their acting capabilities by playing two completely different characters with great chemistry that makes the film funny from start to finish. The film is also supported by an all star cast, who strengthen the film in their own little way, including Dalton, Nighy, Coogan and Broadbent, to name but a few. The overall plot was simple, but entertaining and even shocking at times with a fair bit of violence and also included some amazing action sequences and stunts. The humour was also top form and original and even included the little subtle cornetto joke from Shaun of the Dead. Overall, this is the best of British and will remain a true classic.",8,1,2,21 March 2008
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," Brilliant! Excellent plot, cinematography, acting and absolutely hilarious!
","Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid is a true work of art that combines action, thrill, romance and humour. Newman and Redford make the best on screen couple, with Newman playing the colourful and fast witted Butch Cassidy and Redford playing the reserved quick shooter the Sundance Kid.The film holds many memorable scenes including the knife fight that you think is going to be messy, but cleverly ends before it has even started, with hilarious consequences. The train robbery with Woodcock was truly legendary in the way that Cassidy is able to leer Woodcock out of the carriage and the way in which they blow the safe with a little too much dynamite. Also the scene where they try and rob a Bolivian Bank without speaking the language. These were just a few of the side splitting scenes. Then we have the more touching moment shared with Newman and Ross on the bicycle to 'Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head', a true cinematic masterpiece. The film would not be a Western without action of which there is plenty of, including the scene where they are escaping from the gunmen. The most memorable and moving scene of the whole film is the gun fight, between the two heroes and the Bolivian law enforces. Not only do we witness the heroes becoming wounded, but they continue to share their electrifying wit with one another, even when they are at the lowest.The film finishes spectacularly with the two heroes running out to confront the Bolivian law enforcers, not realising that the Bolivian army has in fact gathered. You are then left with a freeze frame of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, while all you hear is gun shots in the background.",9,0,2,29 May 2008
Pan's Labyrinth," Outstanding! The best modern fantasy to date.
","The brilliance of this film is that it was able to shift between fantasy and reality, which is a challenging task, and del Toro nailed it. Pan's Labyrinth is unlike any other fantasy as it was not at all light hearted, it was in fact much darker than any other fantasy films to date and emphasised the true pain and suffering that was present during the post war era. The storyline was truly moving and mesmerising and has a great climatic ending to it.This film would not have been what it was if it were not for Ivana Baquero's portrayal as Ofelia. Only being twelve you were really able to relate to her character's ordeal throughout, by inflicting her emotion upon the audience. Sergi López as Captain Vidal, gave that film that extra sense of darkness in reality and acted the part to such such a believable extent. Maribel Verdú, who played Mercedes, was surprising in that she undertook an almost heroic figure and you really feel for her character in the way she has to experience being torn between the army and the guerrillas. This film certainly has given more of a different opinion to del Toro as he has produced a true masterpiece.",9,2,5,22 September 2007
The Thing," Outstanding, how all horror films should be made.
","This is without a doubt one of the best horror films ever made. The storyline is amazing, the fact that an alien space craft crashes into the Antarctic where they are frozen in ice for thousands of years gave it that sense realism.The fact that the film begins with the action from the gunning down of the dog by the Norweigians immediately gave the film edge. Only for the members at the science research plant to investigate their camp finding the remains of that alien attack. The overall features of the alien creature's capabilities gradually emerging made the film that more gripping, only films like that of Alien were able to undertake. What was more appealing was the fact the alien can mimic its host turning the film also into a thriller as well, the blood test scene was legendary. The films ending was also great that it left the members in circumstances that you are unable to predict what happens.What deserves great appraisal is the special effects that were able to be performed, 25 years later and they still look realistic. The only thing that let the film down was that most of the characters remained emotionless and the only character that turned out to go crazy just ended up embarrassing himself. This film will always live up to its expectations, a true masterpiece.",7,1,2,28 September 2007
Little Miss Sunshine," One of a very few moving comedies that depicts the problems and delights seen in society today.
","This film certainly brought out each of the actors/actresses acting capabilities. It truly emphasises what it is like in the lives of middle class families today and what effect society can have on hard working individuals. I am also very glad that the plot remained realistic and not just another predictable and corny plot.Abigail Breslin has a promising acting career ahead of her, as unlike most child roles, you actually felt for the character.Greg Kinnear gave a great portrayal as the unsuccessful father, who lets face it, delivered very motivational lines throughout the film.Toni Collette did her bit once again as the emotional mother, she played the role well once again, but if I was her I would move on from these types of role as she has so much more to offer.Paul Dano's acting was truly outstanding, his performance as a 15 year old could not be any more accurate and the scene where he finds out that he is colour blind was one of the best scenes of the film.Alan Arkin certainly deserved the academy award for his role as the grandfather, as I did not even recognise that he was the same guy from Edward Scissorhands. He really gave the character a dark side as a drug addict, a funny side (when talking about girls to Dawyne) and a caring side. I truly had no expectations that his character would have died so early into the film.Steve Carrell, in my opinion, deserves the most credit in this film as like many of the greatest comedians he undertook a troubled character. You really feel for him at the start of the film, discovering that he is a depressive who tried to kill himself and if he already has not gone through enough he has ended up having to live with his sisters family in the most embarrassing circumstances. What makes his performance even more astonishing is that you find out that he is a homosexual. This is most probably one of his most serious roles to date, but he still delivers his genius wit throughout (e.g. the sarcasm scene).What I think made the film is how they show how sick young beauty pageants are how they are just bad taste.Overall though, a very good film.",7,1,2,27 June 2007
Quantum of Solace," Endless unrealistic action and not enough plot.
","Casino Royale reinvented the Bond franchise to give bond back some dignity by digging the franchise out of an ugly hole. Sadly, the franchise seems to be digging itself back into the hole, by having endless action sequences with little in terms of a strong plot.The film is meant to follow straight on from where Casino Royale finished, yet it seemed as though Bond had entered a completely different world. Although the storyline managed to involve familiar faces, such as Mr. White, Felix Leiter, Mathis, and a photo of Vesper Lynd, the plot and acting was so weak that it did not live up to being a sequel. The action sequences performed were too unrealistic and blurry that seemed to be a take of the Bourne franchise, but in this case was badly done. Unlike Casion Royale, Bond was less humanised, which was the reason why Casino Royale was so widely praised, instead it had Bond acting too much like a Jason Bourne, constantly rampaging across different locations giving him more of a 2D persona with little done to emphasise his reason for action. The acting was another floor, Craig did his best to bring back the his original interpretation of Bond, but the plot made it impossible for him to do so. The rest of the characters just seemed to be there to keep the plot flowing. However, Olga Kurylenko deserves appraisal for her performance as the long suffering victim, who has done everything to gain vengeance on the culprits who did this to her. Yet, her character development was also suppressed by the poorly constructed plot. The film ends with a totally unoriginal climax, involving the fight scenes and explosions at the villain's headquarters. Furthermore, it has Bond gaining his vengeance for the loss of Vespa by the weakest possible circumstances, resulting in him going back to his own ways. Overall, the film did very little to carry the franchise and should really have stayed true to how Casion Royale was depicted.",5,7,14,31 October 2008
Fantastic 4: Rise of the Silver Surfer," A big improvement from the previous.
","Overall this film was good, however like the last one it only ran for 1 hour and a half, which was put to fairly good use. However, if it ran for longer, a much stronger film would have resulted.The characters in this film I felt were better portrayed, for example Reed Richards and Sue Storm's relationship was more creative unlike the previous film. Johnny Storm, played by Chris Evans, had more depth other than just being a cocky jock. Whereas Ben Grimm, The Thing, had much less screen time unlike the other characters as I suppose more emphasis what put on him in the first film.What made the film was the Silver Surfer, it really took the franchise to the next level. The master of movement 'Doug Jones', the voice of Laurence Fishburne and outstanding computer generation resulted in the perfect Silver Surfer. Every moment with this character on the screen made watching the film worthwhile, the only hold back was that not enough was seen of him. Considering the limited amount of screen time they did well to include all what was needed to know about the character. What wrecked the Silver Surfer's presence was the portrayal of Galactus as a cloud, who ever thought that up needs their knee caps broken. How can the Silver Surfer possibly relate to a cloud? Also before Galactus even made his presence known, he was destroyed by the Silver Surfer, if he really cared why did he not just do that in the first place?The action scenes also showed great improvement such as the helicopter crashing at the wedding, the chase between Johnny Storm and the Silver Surfer and the confrontation between Dr Doom and Johnny Storm. The action scene based in London, however, was far too Americanised, us Brits in that form of a crisis would have at least gave it more drama and the use of the London Eye falling seemed too much of a cliché.Dr Doom's presence could have also been longer.The next film should certainly bring back the Silver Surfer and increase the screen time.",6,1,3,11 July 2007
The Boy in the Striped Pajamas," An original interpretation of the matters surrounding The Holocaust.
","Not only did this film strongly depict the novel, but took it to the next level by giving the story more of a plot and giving some of the characters more depth. The locations were perfectly chosen and beautifully shot and strongly carried the film's storyline as a result. Many of the actors were perfectly cast, including Asa Butterfield as Bruno who emphasised the innocence of youth, Rupert Friend as Lt Kotler who gave the film that sense of danger, darkening the film's plot, and David Hayman as Pavel who made great emphasis on the overall suffering that was taking place. Vera Farmiga deserves the most appraisal, as she gave an extremely powerful performance as the distraught mother dealing with the aspects of the Holocaust and the ordeal that she is going through when she learns of her son's circumstance ends the film with an orchestratic climax. Nevertheless, David Thewlis was wrongly cast as the Father, as he lacked the presence of a Nazi officer and was not at all convincing with his acting. Jack Scanlon was also not at all convincing as Shmuel, either in presence or when acting, which let the film down considering his importance in the plot.Some scenes were done better than others, the emphasis of the incinerators was all most too painful to watch and the questioning of Lt Kotler at the dining table gave the film more of an edge. Unlike the novel though, many aspects of the Holocaust were briskly skimmed over, which was due mainly to the lack of screen time of Shmuel, which made the overall concept somewhat casual at times. Overall, an interesting concept of The Holocaust that definitely worth viewing.",7,3,5,25 September 2008
Kill Bill: Vol. 1," Fantastic! A great storyline, which provides a tribute cult martial art cinema.
","This film shows Tarantino at his best. The film immediately gets the ball rolling when you see 'The Bride' all beaten within an inch of her life, only to hear a mysterious voice 'Bill' emphasising that he is not sadistic with his actions. Then before The Bride has a moment to speak 'BOOM!' she gets shot in the head. The moment has you jumping right out of your cinema seat and has to be one of the most gripping sequences Tarantino has opened a film with to date.From then on the film is provides an excellent storyline that consists of themes from all types of film genre. The film starts with a bit of Western, which is more the theme in volume 2, but has its good moments. The plot of revenge begins to spark with The Bride fighting Veneta Green (Vivica Fox), which has a bit of martial arts. Tarantino also was able to throw in a bit of Blaxsploitation. You get a bit of thriller thrown in while The Bride remains in a coma and when she wakes up, the theme in this scenes are so dark and it is backed up by an eerie soundtrack that as you on the edge of your seat. The film builds to a climax when you learn of O-Ren Ishii's background and origin, which puts an anime sequence into great use. The climatic part of the film is the whole sequence at the House of Blue Leaves, it is a film sequence that will be remembered throughout cinematic history forever. The whole atmosphere, the music, the characters and the buildup to some of the best fight choreography I have ever seen. This has to be Uma Thurman's best film, I do not think any other actress could have pulled it off. Overall, a great film! Many complained of the extent of violence, I disagree it is most definitely needed, it would not fulfils itself as a revenge movie otherwise.",9,0,3,24 November 2007
The Dark Knight," Visually breath taking, but a long awaited disappointment.
","The Dark Knight did everything to bring the new franchise to the next level, which acted as a double-edged sword. What makes the film praiseworthy is the fact that it was shot on a broad cinematic scale and it also comprised many original ideas. The fact that it was shot on large locations, including Chicago and Hong Kong, made the film footage extremely breathtaking as Batman swooped from the building tops. It also introduced some original and inventive ideas, including how Harvey Dent becomes Two-Face and greater emphasis on the Gotham crime lords.Nevertheless, the film was an overall disappointment. Firstly, the sound quality of the film was absolutely appalling. Therefore, thorough concentration was required throughout the course of the film to pick up the dialogue of the characters and follow the film's overall plot. Secondly, Heath Ledger's portrayal of the Joker was both original and creative as he managed to explore the character's darker origins while throwing in some humour. However, the character was too far-fetched and unfaithful to character from the comic book's origin that was no where near as good as Jack Nicholson's portrayal and is certainly not Oscar worthy. Ledger may have given it his all for the role, but instead turned out to be a little too silly, which made it hard to believe that he was the criminal genius that he was. Instead, Aaron Eckhart should be given the most praise as he embodied the role of both Harvey Dent and Two-Face perfectly, which is impressive considering the amount of screen time he was given.There was also too many sub-plots with little development, which made the plot too complex and also lacked depth, causing viewer's to lose their interest to both the film plot and the character's. They could have been strengthened if they were left to the next film in the franchise. For example, it was a crime to have killed off Two-Face/Harvey Dent over the course of one film.Overall, the film was a long awaited disappointment.",6,1,5,27 July 2008
Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix," The film had potential, the child actors went ahead and let the film down though.
","This film made a good attempt in bringing the book to the screen. Nevertheless, this film seemed to have it all an outstanding British cast, an excellent location and a great story, but somehow it did not result in the masterpiece for what it should have been. My conclusion is that David Yates was not the right person to direct, I looked on his profile and so far he has only done television work. This explains why a lot of the final scenes were so woody and why the editing was so poor that the film was barely able to flow. I think it was therefore wrong to enter him into the Potter franchise, where he is still a novice when it comes to blockbuster films.The main problem for this film was that not enough depth from the book was obtained. If it was aloud to run over 3 hours, as opposed to 2 hours 18 minutes than a more stronger grasp of the story would have resulted. Instead the film just seemed to scratch the surface and ended up becoming more light hearted than exhilarating.What made the film were the actors, such as Imelda Staunton who portrayed Dolores Umbridge, Helena Bonham Carter's role as Bellatrix Lestrange and Ralph Fiennes molding of Lord Voldemort. These actors in the limited time frame they had made the best use of it and brought what little electricity there was to the screen.Whereas, the rest of the perfect cast was wasted due to their limited screen time. You have the modern British greats working on this film Gary Oldman, Alan Rickman, Brendan Gleeson, David Thewlis, Maggie Smith, Julie Walters, Jason Isaacs, Michael Gambon, Emma Thompson and Robbie Coltrane. Yet they were literally given a couple of sentences each and that was their lot, I don't even though why they bothered to turn up on set. In particular it was heartbreaking to see Gary Oldman, to me he is my favourite actor, but Gary you have gone from being bad to good and somehow you have lost your ways of stage presence. The way they killed you off really did not leave much to the imagination, go back to your old ways. Alan Rickman you did not have as much screen time either, but I am glad to see that your are now providing a better portrayal of Snape.The kid actors were another story, they were all either just a bunch of moody teenagers or just overly enthusiastic. Hats off though to Evanna Lynch, who played Luna Lovegood, you not only provided a great acting debut, but you separated yourself from the rest of the pack. Overall, I expect to see more depth in the next film with better use of characters or you might as well just write off the Potter franchise now.",6,0,1,2 August 2007
Pulp Fiction," A collection of three stories full of suspense, betrayal and faith
","A 'MASTERPIECE'! The greatest selection of cast in the history of film, which brought back the faces of John Travolta and Bruce Willis. Also bringing fame to Samuel L Jackson and Uma Thurman, for their memorable characters as Jules Winfield and Mia Wallace. It will go down in history for its memorable scenes from the 'Ezekiel 25:17' passage and 'the Jack Rabbit Slim's Twist Contest'. With some of the best dialogue, suspense and an unforgettable soundtrack it will be remembered as one of Quentin Tarantino's greatest triumphs which will maintain its greatness for the many years to follow. Which will inspire and entertain all of those who watch it in the near future.",10,0,1,18 June 2005
30 Days of Night," One of the better recent vampire films.
","30 Days of Night was overall a good film. The overall atmosphere of its setting in Alaska gave the film that extra edge. This is emphasised in opening scene where you see Ben Forster's character emerge from the cruise liner, which had to be one of the best screen shots throughout the whole film.Ben Forster as 'The Stranger' is one of his best acting performances to date, he pulled it off very convincingly and built up the suspense and tension very well.The suspense remains partially strong throughout the emergence of the vampires as darkness falls. This remains strong as some of the first victims are targeted and reaches a climatic moment when you see the whole town fall into complete havoc as the vampires unleash their hunger upon the locals. This scene remains truly memorable as the camera pans out above the town where you see victims being targeted, as well as vampires being shot at.It is up to the emergence of the vampires that the tension goes, they do not seem a threat to look at. The only thing they possess are jagged teeth, widened pupils, long sharp fingernails, some have hooked noses and to make themselves look more surreal they do not bother wiping their mouths. Throughout the film you realise they dress in a goth-like fashion, other than Danny Huston's character who looks like a middle-aged business man. They also think they are a threat as they constantly shriek, believe me it was more annoying than scary. The worst vampire had to be the little girl in the convenience store, who mutters a line very similar to most evil doing children like all horror films.The overall time scale was not emphasised, as it seemed like the circumstances only took place over a period of a day than 30 days.Unlike most horror films, a lot of the characters were truly effected by the deaths. Josh Hartnett, unlike most heroic characters, sheds the odd tear for some of the victim's, to the death of character's he was probably very close to. Manu Bennett's acting was incredible, he remained utterly heartbroken when he killed his wife and daughters that had been transformed.As the film draws to an end though, it goes slightly off the rails. Due to Josh Hartnett purposely transforming himself into a vampire to save his wife, who looked like she was safe enough. The death of Danny Huston's character was also sudden and unexpected, a bit of a let down there.The film ends well though with the Hartnett and George watching the sunset together only for Hartnett to burn to dust.Overall, a fairly enjoyable film, it is more suitable for persons though that are more interested in the genre though.",6,2,5,3 November 2007
The Reader," Faithful to the novel, but no where near as moving.
","Stephen Daldry hit the nail on the head for his interpretation of the novel. His choice of location, cinematography and casting were spot on, which enabled him to deliver a well depicted version of the novel.Kate Winslet and David Kross were the backbone of the film, as they portrayed Michael Berg and Hanna Schmitz, respectively, as they were written in the novel. Ultimately, their chemistry and interplay was particularly electrifying and makes the audience really feel for their characters. Surprisingly, Ralph Fiennes portrayal of the older Michael Berg was a major let down, as he did a poor job in emphasising the pain and suffering that the character goes through.The court scene is another disappointment. Although it is depicted as written in the novel, the scene would have been strengthened if the film makers had shown flash backs of the events surrounding the Holocaust, which was the major event of this film.The film is worth watching, but it is no masterpiece.",7,6,9,7 January 2009
Heat," A film masterpiece!
","This film brought the Godfathers of Hollywood (if you excuse the pun) to bring you Heat, one of the greatest crime thrillers to hit the big screen. The overall plot is mesmerising, due to the fact that you experience the lives on persons on both sides of the law that are thrown together to take you on an incredible ride through the world of bank heists and shoot outs. You have Pacino as Vincent Hanna, the sharp and volatile cop investigating a line of heists. The thieves responsible for these heists are De Niro, as Neil McCauley, the smooth and mysterious mastermind, and his right hand men Kilmer and Sizemore. Despite the great ensemble of cast, Pacino and De Niro steal the show by both delivering unforgettable lines and action scenes. The beauty of this cast ensemble is that neither one of them out staged one another, as if one delivered one good line the other would just hit the other back with an equally good line. The scene within the diner is a truly classic scene, where you see Pacino and De Niro just talk, no yelling or physical movement, yet each line they deliver electrifies the scene.Other than Pacino and De Niro, the film also consists of a thrilling shoot out, keeping you on the edge of your seat by the sound of every gun shot.No doubt about it, Mann is a genius, and this is his masterpiece!",9,4,8,22 March 2008
Fantastic Four," Doesn't really live up the its title.
","The problem with this film is that it embarks from a popular franchise, yet it really was not 'fantastic'. The overall casting was good, but I think the plot was far too weak, as the film just seemed to coast without any real energy as such. This is probably because it was all crammed into a period of 1 hour and a half, whereas most other marvel films last at least 2 hours. As a result the audience is thrown into a plot without a chance of gaining any depth from each of the characters or plot. As a result the film was just too light hearted, which is not what you want in an action / adventure film. Scenes such as when they were in space was absolutely pathetic, The Thing's story was just all over the place and the romance between Mr Fantastic and Invisible Girl was extremely casual. The list could go on, but I do not think it deserves the effort.All in all though you will find that the film finishes before it even begins.Hopefully the Silver Surfer will bring the Fantastic Four out of the deep grave they dug themselves into.",5,0,1,5 July 2007
Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade," An unforgettable epic undertaken by two of the greatest cinematic heroes in film
","The Last Crusade takes the franchise back to the more familiar origins of Raiders. The film starts with Indiana Jones' first adventure, where River Phoenix takes on the role of Indiana Jones. Phoenix is an absolute pleasure to watch on screen, not only does he show some resemblance to Harrison Ford, but he even throws in some of his actions and facial expressions. He deserves the most credit for the action sequence that he undertakes on the circus train. The circus train revisits the franchise as B movie material and it does so with a twist. You learn how Jones develops a fear of snakes, how he uses a bull whip and how he develops a scar on his chin. It has to be one of the greatest scenes of the whole film.Ford delivers his usual business as Jones in terms of his acting and activity in terms of the action sequences. However, Sean Connery steals the show and he does so in a more subtle manner. Considering that he was one of the main influences for the Indiana Jones character, he did not just revisit his origins, but instead played completely the opposite as a academic, calm and reserved person. Nevertheless, he manages to top his son at whatever he did, including sleeping with the same woman, coincidentally escaping from the Nazis and bringing down a German mesherschmit by the means of seagulls. Alison Doody also Dr. Elsa Schneider deserves appraisal for her very convincing role as a female Nazi. Julian Glover is outstanding for his role as the main villain and both Jonathan Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliot return as Sallah and Marcus Brody return as more of a comic relief.The film continues to comprise many unforgettable scenes, including the tomb of Sir Richard, the boat chase in Venice, the rescue and escape of Henry Jones Sr. from the Nazis. There is also the Nazi blimp scene and the escape from the German mesherschmits, the reclaiming of the Grail diary from the Nazis, with a cameo of Hitler, the tank battle and the overall finding of the Grail.What is particularly touching is that it was not just a case of finding the Holy Grail, but it was instead a story of father and son finding one another. The film ends warmly, as the Jones Jr., Jones Sr., Sallah and Brody ride off into the sunset, which will be the last time we ever see this quartet together on screen together. It is this scene that will always be remembered for their completion of 'The Last Crusade'.",8,1,2,26 May 2008
The Simpsons Movie," A good effort, but it was wrong to have made a film once the franchise had weakened.
","This film to me did not really fulfil what The Simpsons is about, as it was made once the franchise had gone downhill. The way the film started was OK, with a mildly funny Itchy and Scratchy cartoon followed by a slightly comical title sequence. However, then came along the appearance of Green Day, which is fair play, but obviously only made their appearance to promote their tacky version of The Simpsons theme tune.Then there was the amusing scene with nude skateboarding Bart, which was just revisiting a used gag in a previous episode, apart from being a bit more revealing. However, the writers did manage to squeeze in the humorous gag when the Flanders family are praying. On a rarity you were able to feel a little remorse for Bart, which strengthened the scene.Then came the introduction of most probably the worst character to ever be a part of The Simpsons, a pig. Although it had something to do with the plot, each scene it was in made the film cringing to watch, why the writers thought that Homer blowing raspberries on a pig would be funny is beyond belief. I also have no idea why the song Spider Pig was so funny? OK its a rip off the Spiderman theme tune, but the writers gave it lyrics that sounded as though they had been improvised by a 2 year old. The overall destruction of Springfield lake was also a revisit from a previous episode. Which introduced you to President Arnold Schwarzenegger, which if the writer's were on the ball should have been President Rainier Wolfcastle. This was an attempt to make a stab at the Governor of California, but it seemed like they had based him more on President Bush. Therefore the writers shot themselves in the foot there 'CRETINS!'. Then they once again introduced an out of the blue character who just so happened that he wanted to destroy Springfield.There is then every attempt to squeeze in as many of the characters as possible, giving the odd one liners, which really was a let down.From then on Bart shows more of an interest in Flander's as a father, Lisa finds a boy she likes and Marge questions her relationship with Homer, sounds very familiar!Therefore, its up to Homer to put things right as usual with a happy outcome with a little aid from Maggie and a poor special appearance from Tom Hanks.All in all it could have just been another episode, it hurts me to say this. There was barely any sign of originality, more just retracing previous jokes and predictable gags.The Simpsons has given us a great ride, but enough is enough, you have gained much achievement in your work and you will provide enjoyment to audiences for the rest of eternity. For now though drink your final rounds of Duff from Moe's and head to Springfield Canyon to watch the sun set over Springfield and leave everyone in a happy state of mind.",2,6,10,31 July 2007
