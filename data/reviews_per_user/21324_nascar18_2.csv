Casablanca," The greatest movie ever made.
",Regardless of Bogart only receiving one Oscar in his lifetime for The African Queen this to me is the quintissential Bogart movie and every actor in it probably did his/her best work including Claude Raines as Capt. Renault. In my opinion a remake of this movie is totally unnecessary because there is no one who can capture the essence of Rick like Bogart.,10,1,1,1 April 2000
12 Angry Men," One of Henry Fondas' best roles.
",This along with Grapes of Wrath and Once Upon a Time in the West are my favorite Fonda roles; just watching him one by one turn each of the jurors to his way of thinking is amazing and Lee J Cobb battling him until the very end is one of the classic one on one duels ever in movie history.,10,0,1,1 April 2000
