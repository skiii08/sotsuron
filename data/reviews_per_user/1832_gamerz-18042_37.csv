The Devil's Advocate," Original and interesting
","I'd never seen Keanu smile, here we see his acting range before he stereotyped himself into a muted action persona.Charlize Theron's relationship annoys with over the top PDA, but swiftly redeems herself with some amazing acting in various scenes.The story is well told, and never lets up. There's some unexpected gruesome scenes, and Al Pacino plays his role as the boss naturally.Not the best movie, but good for the 90s.",7,0,0,26 May 2020
The Mask," Classic, entertaining, a 90s special
","Have seen this countless times and always enjoy watching jim carrey express his wacky mind throughout. Hillarious, a must see.",8,0,0,2 May 2020
Hereditary," Surprisingly scary, good film!
","I put this on Prime as a background movie without much thought.
Half way through I had to put my phone down and was fully immersed in the movie.It starts off slowish and the tension gradually builds up. With the recent crop of generic one dimensional horror films, this one finally brings some substance and not just the cheap thrills.The actors are fantastic, the mother in particular. Her unstable demeanor, and manic behaviour are unsettling at times.The ending wasn't predictable and the darker scenes are truly uncomfortable to watch.",8,2,4,27 July 2019
Fight Club," Masterpiece
","The plot was incredible, interesting, script writing superb and 2 of the best actors at the time.The cinematography is brilliant, the dark humour, twists, style. Every element of this film was executed to perfection.This movie set a new standard and precedent in the industry.",10,1,1,31 July 2019
Captain Marvel," Captain Average
","Never really got my interest, the storyline is made unnecessarily complex when the characters and premise are basic.One of the least interesting characters in marvel universe.",5,2,2,18 April 2020
This Is the End," One of the best comedies out there
","Great chemistry between the cast. Various well known comedians, and celebrity cameos.Some great script writing and journey with the boys.",9,1,2,31 July 2019
Us," Absolute tripe
","This is the kind of film where you are looking at your watch half way through, and after enduring 2+ hours you leave with a whatever.It started well, and then descended into absurd territory which barely made any sense. A lot of the scenes were just laughable, the script was all over the place, I didn't even care what was going on by the end.",5,2,2,31 July 2019
Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga," 8 points go to this movie
","I really wanted to like this film.
Is it funny? Somewhat.The story and plot take precedence over comedy.
After a tame start, the movie drastically improves.The production quality is high. The accents were good, and the cast and visuals are great during their performances.The movie is fantastically ridiculous and embodies the spirit of Eurovision.Overall an enjoyable watch.",8,3,5,29 June 2020
The Others," A scary film that gives nothing away!
","Fantastic acting, well shot, and great writing.This is not a horror film per say, but still had me on edge throughout.It's an emotional movie, the ending is perfect.",9,0,1,18 August 2019
Yes Man," Some comedy at best, mostly Fantasy
","Decent plot and acting, although the comedy was subdued and the film takes a more serious tone.The issue with the film is the unrealistic prospect of the premise - 'saying yes to everything'.In the real world let me assure you, saying yes to everything would turn into a hellish nightmare by the end of the week.So the moral of the story is to say yes all the time? Definitely not, but to be open to more opportunities.",6,1,1,22 April 2020
The Beach," A film that brings nostalgia!
","A lovely film, with a slightly bizzare ending.
For a couple of hours you are on holiday with the cast.It could have been shot better, the story line is erratic but a nice soundtrack and holiday vibes/ adventure make it a pleasant watch.",7,1,2,18 August 2019
Shutter Island," Excellent eary movie!
","Di Caprio as always brilliant, shows up to an island to investigate a mental asylum.What insues is a really well told journey, the script and details are cleverly placed throughout.The sound track and visuals are superb and nothing is certain until the end...The viewer is definitely put through an array of emotions here, and that's why I rate it so highly.",9,1,2,12 August 2019
Bird Box," Should have bought a blindfold and earplugs.
","The premise of the movie made me cringe. Having watched it, I'm baffled how holywood could release this tripe.The entire plot is simply incredibly far-fetched, stupid and full of plot holes.Half way through I stopped caring, and wish I'd also been blindfolded for this mediocrity.Even as we are forced with a feel good ending it's just all too ludicrous.",2,1,2,27 July 2019
Armageddon," The original Blockbuster movie
","I don't understand the hate for this film, some people seem unable to appreciate the movie for what it is. Yes it's epic, a bit cliche over the top but it was done brilliantly and was one of the first in doing so.I have yet to see a film with a better cast, amazing actors each in their own right.The CGI is fantastic for 1998 and still holds up well today. Some of the cinematography is superb, the script well thought out and Michael Bay should be praised for this.The sound track both by Hanz Simmer and Aerosmith are classics.This film is the definition of epic and heaps fun to watch!",10,6,8,31 July 2019
We're the Millers," Memorable comedy!
","This was surprisingly funny, and perhaps one of the best comedies in recent times.Some of the conversations and one liners had me in stitches.",8,0,0,20 May 2020
Disturbia," Nice thriller, got my attention
","This film has that 90s teen slasher vibe.It was a break out role for Shia le boeuf.
The acting throughout was spot on, characters real and likeable.",7,0,0,10 May 2020
Jarhead," An average film about a mediocre war
","The film tried hard to reproduce memorable war scenes and character dynamics, seen in other popular war movies, i.e. Appocalypse Now and Black Hawk Down.
However it falls way short, leaving the viewer with a feeble message - perhaps intended by the director.Theres nice cinematography, albeit overdone CGI. The acting is good and there's some interestimg moments.",6,0,0,17 June 2020
Avengers: Endgame," Not a huge fan, but probably the best one in trilogy
","The complexity and dozens of meaningless characters thrown in to the sequel was unnecessary and a mess to keep up with.
In this conclusion we see our favourite main characters again and some slight twists with a decent ending. The CGI and acting great as usual, however some of the scenes are irritating in their convenience. I.e. captain America taking too much of the spotlight considering his powers.",7,1,5,12 August 2019
28 Days Later...," Simply the best Zombie movie made
","I've watched almost every zombie, post appocalyptic movie out there. This one stands out a league above the rest.The soundtrack is great, fantastic acting.
The feeling of isolation and immanent danger always present. The horror scenes are frenetic and you are kept on edge throughout.It's a very sombre movie, not for the feign hearted, I hope they complete the trilogy.",9,3,4,27 July 2019
Aladdin," Questionable casting, but superb visuals
","I'm usually a Will Smith fan, but something is off, the character needed a natural comedian, i.e. Chris Tucker would've been perfect!
Jaffar is somewhat basic and lacking charisma, whilst Alladin and Jasmin are good.The acting is good, although a bit forced at times. However the visuals, choreography, and remake of the cartoon scenes are done really well.",7,0,1,18 April 2020
The Lion King," Amazing visuals, subdued performance
","The original was my favourite Disney film.
Sadly in this remake some moments were modified for worse and the film's script felt choppy.Interactions between the characters feel slightly robotic at times, the voice actors could have been better. Seth Rogan was the best part.The script is simplified at times and parts of the original movie are watered down.The father clouds scene was a major let down. Nala's introduction to Simba as an adult is ridiculous.Overall the CGI is great, but the execution of key moments fail multiple times.",7,2,5,10 August 2019
A Quiet Place," Most overrated 'horror' film in decades
","I came into this movie with high expectations, the raving reviews and my friend's incessant praise had me fooled into the hype.This movie isn't even a horror, honestly it felt like a long episode of X files from the 90's mixed with Mars Attack the movie. The CGI is fairly poor compared to other films such as Aliens and Marvel franchise etc.
None the less I was willing to look past this on the premise of a good plot or gripping story line, unfortunately it had neither.The story follows a family trying to survive a post apocalyptic world where aliens kill you if you make any noise. The movie then goes on to break any logic in this by shoving numerous plot holes and glaring discrepancies to the viewer.
There's no start, no explanation, no real journey or ending, we are simply thrust midway through a glimpse of their life.Emily Blunt gives a great performance, but sadly nothing saves her from the poor writing and continuous clichés. The ridiculous ending sums the movie up well.I was bored half way through and just hoped they all died, I really couldn't care less and barely remember much of this time sink movie.",4,4,7,18 July 2018
Ex Machina," Good at times, flops half way through
","The storyline interesting, and acting fine.Sadly it drags on and I found the third act anti climatic and lacklustre with no purposeful ending..
The film is a PG version of Terminator.",6,0,3,30 April 2020
Event Horizon," Strange film, escalates quickly!
","I was hoping to watch a space sci fi film, midway through we are thrust into pure horror with some gruesome scenes. The entire complexity of the film changes.It's an eerie and lonely journey, with the third act not to my taste.",6,1,3,18 August 2019
Midsommar," Just your standard pagan cult
","A decent pagan film, although it drags on and becomes predictable. It misses various opportunities where it could have used certain characters or moments to make the plot more interesting and eerie.Instead it's all a bit flat and comes nowhere close to Hereditary.Also the first scene and the rest of the movie seem completely irrelevant to each other which seemed very odd. The ending was lazy and convenient.",6,0,6,7 April 2020
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind," Masterpiece! Creative genius!
","The writing, acting, premise and soundtrack make this one of the best movies I've ever seen.The mashup of art, music, love and creativity is a delight to watch. The cinematography is surreal and spectacular, and shows us the true essance of human relationships in their purest and most sincere form.Jim Carrey was outstanding and truly proves he's an exceptional actor, and not just a comedian.It's a story about love, melancholy, the highs and lows, self introspection. I really love this film.",10,0,0,27 July 2019
It Chapter Two," CGI scare Frenzy overload
","Started decently then we are gradually subjected to more scares to the point where the entire film becomes a mess of CGI thrown in at every possible moment.
Incredibly long movie, lost any sense of scare or interest half way through.",5,1,1,7 January 2020
Inception," The kind of movie dreams are made of...
","Every so often, a film comes along and stands out far from the rest.Inception is creativity at its finest.
Incredible acting, CGI, and actors.It's not just an action film, the subplot and background story/relationship is what earns this one 10 stars.",10,0,0,31 July 2019
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)," Some of the best acting you'll ever see
","Spectacular acting, particularly from Keaton. I thoroughly enjoyed watching his story unfold.A movie with depth, meaning, drama and comedy in between.Cinematography and continuous style was sublime. One of those movies that you can truly appreciate as a work of art.",10,1,4,16 February 2020
1408," Not scary, decent idea when it came out
","John Cusack is great here, he is given little to work with (the entire film is in a room). Sadly the movie gets increasingly unrealistic as it progresses.There could have been some more horror thrown in, after all the information we are told about the room prior to check in, the script is rather tame.If you've seen shutter island, this is a worse version. The ending is straight forward and predictable.",6,0,1,18 August 2019
Black Panther," Forced agenda, film quality suffers
","This is one of those films they made solely to appease the diversity brigade, blacklivesmatter, feminista etc etc.This wasn't even what bothered me, it was the stupid accent by the main guy, and the tideous slow paced film progression.I was bored to tears 35 mins in and decided to call it quits. Not up to par with the other hero films.There were no white actors, the black actor tries to imitate the African accent, and the film was made in Hollywood, what the f is goin on",6,2,4,31 July 2019
Mother!," Trailer better than the film
","As mentioned countless times this movie is bizzare, perhaps revolting and confusing, but it is well acted and original.The tension is excruciating towards the end and we are left with an unique interpretation.",7,0,0,12 August 2019
The Emperor's New Groove," Low key release, hillarious film!
","This one went under the radar for a while.
Having seen it 2 or 3 times now, as an adult I still find it amusing and well made.The characters are memorable and unique and follow a nice story, creative and illustrious rendition.It really is one of the funniest animations out there.",8,1,2,12 August 2019
Trainspotting," Love it. Grim, realistic, a classic.
","This film defines an era in the UK, a grim reality on the fringes of society.It's delightful script, story telling, cast, and visuals take us back to that feeling of being in the 90s.Along with a banging sound track, and a perfect ending, Danny Boyle is possibly the greatest director to emerge from the UK.Steve Irwing adaption was great, for that I chose life and chose 10.",10,0,0,25 June 2020
Coach Carter," Cliché American Heaven
","This was a rehash of a rehash of a rehash.
(i.e. see mighty ducks, cool runnings etc).
Everything was incredibly predictable, the characters were stereotyped to death.
Tatum acts like some next level thug, laughable.
The story follows a straight path, the only redeeming moment was the ending, and credit stories.",6,0,1,7 January 2020
Donnie Darko," A classic, original, one of a kind film
","Saw this years ago, it's very well directed, the storyline is impeccable, yet leaving open much thought and interpretation to the viewer.The acting is great, and creepiness keeps you entertained throughout.",9,0,0,16 April 2020
The Martian," 'How to cultivate potatoes'
","This film had potential, unfortunately not much happens and we are just subjected to an individuals mundane life on Mars.If you are interested in harvesting potatoes I'd recommend it, for anything else just have a snooze.",6,0,1,18 August 2019
