Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi," SRK-Adi-YRF Magic Worked Again Biggg Time !!!!
","Kahani: Basically, Suri falls in love with Tani at first sight and she has to marry him coz of some problems. She doesn't love him and so he changes himself to Raj! A dance show takes place where Tani and Raj keep meeting and so Tani falls in love with Raj without realizing that Raj is Suri! To find out who she stays with at the end you have to watch the movie! 4.75/5Performances: Shah Rukh Khan Omg, this MAN is just unbelievable! He was flawless as usual but this time it was just something different yet brilliant! SRK plays 2 characters in the movie, Suri and Raj. Suri is an ordinary man who is boring, shy but very cute! He loves Tani to bits and so changes himself to Raj, a very modern and handsome young man! SRK plays both the characters very well and believe me you, if you thought that Suri was really cute in the Haule Haule promo, then you've seen nothing yet! I just cant believe how cute a simple man can be And of those people who say SRK cant do comedy now my answer to you is think again! I just fell in love with SRK all over again! 5/5 (though, I don't think I can rate SRK - he is just fab!!)Anushka Anushka aka Tani is a very modern yet cultured girl (thats what i felt)! She marries Suri coz she has to but doesn't love him! Anushka has done a fab job and her performance was just outstanding! At first, I didn't think she was all that and really thought that she might not be able to play the role! But oh boy, I was so wrong! She was brilliant and I seriously, cant say she is a newcomer! Anyways, personally i feel she is the best newcomer in a very long time! 4.5/5Vinay Pathak Omg, this guy was really funny! He is Suri's close buddy in the movie and helps him turn into Raj! He was another fantastic and a very emotional character in the movie! A very good performance by Vinay but I don't really know how to rate him! I can try tho! 4/5Music: Haule Haule - 5/5 Tujh Main Rab Dikhta Hai (male) - 5/5 Tujh Main Rab Dikhta Hai (female) - 5/5 Dance Pe Chance - 4.5/5 (tho its starting to grow on me now) Phir Milenge Chalte Chalte - 4.5/5 Dancing Jodi - 4.5/5OMG, I just love the music in this movie! At first I never used to like some of the songs as much but after watching them, I just love them! Especially, Dancing Jodi - That was the one I liked the least but now I just love itI would like to rate it 5/5 but then you guys will kill me for it therefore am giving it 4.75/5Baaki-Sab: Spoiler Alert Firstly, OMG Suri is just so cute and his smile in this movie is just to die for!! the bit where he nearly drops the laptop is so funny but my heart nearly came out in that scene (as most of my friends n family know how much i love laptops esp mine lol)! In the beginning when SRK puts the rose on the table near the note (with his phone number) and then put it back to the place is also very cute n funny! oh also, when she gives him the food and tifin he gets so happy, and when he doesn't know wat macho means, and the pani puri bit... - omg, i can just go on and on and on lol Tani's and Raj's characters were also fantastic and the bits they came in together they looked lovely as a couple! I found the movie really funny and at the same time it had a sweet and simple (love) story! omg, the bit where raj and Tani go out is just so gorgeous and omg, the 'i love u' in the lights *faints* I felt so bad for Suri when Tani told Raj that she didn't love anyone and omg, when Suri was getting beaten up by that stupid Japanese guy - i felt like crying oh i haven't laughed like this in a long time! Damn it! Suri is just so cute - if only he was for real! The end-credits are really funny lol oh and not to forget the last dance SRK can dance so well *faints* OK, i have always loved his dancing but this was so different! i don't remember seeing him dance that way and that too in those loose clothes and omg, did any of u lot notice! SRK's REAL LIFE pics were in the movie! i saw 2! have i forgotten anything!? don't think so but seriously, once again Suri is the cutest character ever! that shy smile of his is stuck in my head now! lol IT WAS HOUSEFULL!The Bottom-Line: Overall, a very nice and entertaining movie! its a must watch and personally, i don't think anyone can get bored of it! I can watch this movie again and again without getting tired but thats just ME! 5/5",10,2,6,14 December 2008
