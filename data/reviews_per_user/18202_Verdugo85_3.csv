Iron Man 3," Better than Iron Man 2 but I wanna talk about The Mandarin..
","Iron Man 2 could've been better, I still like it but Iron Man 3 is an improvement. Now, I wanna talk about The Mandarin. Alot of fanboys and trouble-making Marvel haters got their panties in a bunch trashing Iron Man 3 only because of the whole Mandarin thing. Yes, thats the only reason why yall hate Iron Man 3, I dont care. I get it, Ben Kingsley was The Mandarin based on the trailer and marketing but the twist took nothing away because he was never The Mandarin. Ben Kingsley's character was just a washed up British actor getting paid to play a role pretending to be a terrorist in the media. The real villain is Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearce), he's the mastermind who used 'The Mandarin/Ten Rings' as a decoy to protect his illegal explosive experiment. Killian and his company 'AIM' were the villains. Killian claimed to be The Mandarin but he really wasnt, although he did have some traits of the character but he created his own version.And NO! you dont need to watch the One Shot 'Hail To The King' short film with Ben Kinglsey to learn that a real Mandarin exist in the MCU. He was already hinted in Iron Man 3 long before the short film was considered. To quote Aldrich Killian 'Because the second you give evil a face, a Bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, and you hand the people a target.' There you go. That wasnt so hard,eh? The real Mandarin/Ten Rings are still out there. They had nothing to do with the events of Iron Man 3. The One Shot 'Hail To The King' short film was not an apology, it was to shut you spoiled brats up.",9,4,5,28 March 2018
Star Wars: Episode IX - The Rise of Skywalker," The middle finger to Darth Vader
","Im just gonna get to the point.This movie discredit Darth Vader's heroic actions when he saved his son Luke from Emperor Palpatine by destroying him in 'Return Of The Jedi'. Episode IX revealed that Palpatine in Return Of The Jedi was a clone and the 'real' Palpatine is the main villain who gets destroyed by Rey. Whats difference did it made??Darth Vader is the greatest villain in the Star Wars universe and they screwed him over like that just to give all the credit to a Mary Sue because..'the force is female'. Sadly, Darth Vader is now looked at as a loser. Its a spit in the face to George Lucas, to fans and it makes the original trilogy completely pointless. Political agendas out of control, how disgraceful. This movie deserves the bad press its getting.This is like how in Terminator Dark Fate (a sequel that was suppose to follow up to the first two) had John Connor killed off in the first 5 mins which made the first two films POINTLESS!! John Connor is the reason for the story of The Terminator.. But all that change was to give credit to an uninteresting female character. Whats difference did it made?? And then you wonder why the movie sucked and lost lots of money..",1,53,106,19 December 2019
Wonder Woman," Finally a good DCEU film!!
","You know..As a comic book fan, The DCEU films has been very disappointing with Man Of Steel, Batman V Superman and Suicide Squad. And now we have a game-changer: Wonder Woman!!Wonder Woman is the 4th DCEU film and first live action feature film. Wonder Woman delivers good origin story, decent action (no over the top CGI destruction porn), good fight scenes, funny moment, nice romantic moments between Diana & Steve Trevor (Chris Pine).I was concern with this film back then because of the DCEU's poor reputation and Gal Gadot as an actress to pull off Wonder Woman in her own film BUT she and the movie proved me wrong. She impressed me as Wonder Woman, she embodied the character much like how Christopher Reeve embodied Superman, good job Gal. Im not a fan of Wonder Woman but I know some things about her and pretty much this film captures the essence of the character and story, I believe its based on the new 52 series. Im glad that Wonder Woman was finally given the chance to shine (giving a break to the usual Batman/Superman) and deservedly praised. WB needs to keep on shining the rest of the DC superheroes.I enjoyed Chris Pine as Steve Trevor: Cool, bold, courageous, funny, passionate and determined, Chris Pine nailed it. Him and Gal had chemistry. I'd love to see him again!I don't want to say much but Wonder Woman is worth watching. Its one of the best superhero films in the same sense as Superman 1978, Batman Begins, Iron Man, Captain America: The First Avenger and Spider-Man (2002).",8,6,11,6 June 2017
