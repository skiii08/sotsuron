Casablanca," Here's Lookin' at You Kid
","I don't know that it's possible for a 19 year old kid to say anything new about this movie. Is it a classic? Ehhh, maybe but probably not since i'm going to have a hard time stretching this review out to 10 lines. Luckily, Bogart's performance gives me something to talk about because, as always, his acting is captivating. Without he and Bergman this film would fall flat. The romance is pretty cheesy and formulaic. Plug in any attractive blonde and she could play Ilsa and any big brute of a man could play Laszlo. Hell, the fact that Peter Lorre's character was more interesting than Laszlo speaks volumes to the nature of this film. It's a good movie without a doubt but i just don't get the common tag of greatest film of all time. The only thing really stopping me from giving this movie lower than a 7 is Bogart. He just draws you in as an actor and i can't remember the last bad film i watched with him in it.",7,0,2,6 May 2011
Citizen Kane," Ugh....
","So, I'll give this film credit for the message it sends with the importance of youth and the whole searching for rosebud idea. It seems like an overplayed film theme but Citizen Kane does a decent enough job with it. With that said, I will now proceed to rake this film over the coals. I hated it. I felt like it was dull and incredibly uninspiring. Like I said before, it had potential with it's message but it never delivered. There's an incredible lack of focus on his youth and most of the film falters in my opinion as it doesn't make Kane out to look like a confused man, it makes him out to be more tyrannical and sinister. He; cheats on his first wife, beats his second wife and forces her to perform an opera to prove that HE is not a failure, and on top of that he fires his 'best friend' from his paper for writing an honest review of his wife's pitiful performance. Oh and he never sees his son, so what kind of youth is he providing for him? Now on top of all of this, how is this film innovative? I've been taking History of American Cinema at my college and I don't see anything that is new and adds to the way movies are made. I was expecting a real masterpiece and boy was I ever disappointed. I just don't understand how this film is so well spoken of.",2,2,6,11 May 2011
Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," A Really Great 'Modern' Western
","I loved Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. George Roy Hill did a great job giving it the feeling of a real western even though it was released 30 years after the height of the genre. He coupled beautiful cinematography with great casting and an exciting closing scene. The scenery is spectacular and you'll feel like you've been dropped smack dab in the middle of the 'wild west.' The best part of this film though has to be the casting. Paul Newman and Robert Redford were great (Especially Redford)and much like Bonnie and Clyde you're easily able to connect with and root for these two although they're constantly breaking the law. The two are witty, charming and surprisingly funny. The only knock I have on this film is the music. I feel like it was a mistake using more modern music in the film which was supposed to be set in the 1890's but it's a small complaint against an otherwise well made movie.",9,0,1,11 May 2011
Annie Hall," The Best Woddy Allen Film
","Whether you like Woddy Allen as a person or not, I'd have a hard time believing you can't find this film funny. He plays an incredibly sympathetic character, Alvy (who closely resembles Allen) whose constant narration gives you a unique look at the inner workings of his mind. This narration, coupled with the subtitles in the scene where Alvy and Annie Hall get acquainted are prime examples of Allen's ability to push the boundaries of reality all while keeping things fresh and funny. He plays his typical Woddy Allen role as a man chasing a girl, Annie Hall (Diane Keaton) but if you've seen previous works of his you'll notice that this film is much more serious than earlier ones, he poses questions about fate and destiny but he still adds his little touch of humor (a great example is the flash back to the younger Alvy, the kid who played him is hysterical given the coupling of adult feelings with a child's dialogue). The film is shot beautifully and you may notice some similarities to the Godfather in this area as both films used Gordon Willis for cinematography.",10,0,0,10 May 2011
The Graduate," Witty and Incredibly Funny
","In one of his earliest film roles Dustin Hoffman performs brilliantly as The Graduate (Benjamin Braddock). The movie is witty and thought provoking. His actions aren't admirable but he's able to invoke a sense of sympathy with his character as you can feel the poor young man's confusion. On top of this he does a good job of playing the age of his character, you get the sense that he's been taken advantage of and by the end of the film you'll find yourself pulling for he and Elaine (Kathrine Ross) both. The scuba suit scene is a nice touch with the switch to a first person point of view where the view of the audience is cropped by the edges of the scuba mask, it's quite unique actually. It also adds to the sympathetic nature of Benjamin as it gives you the feeling that he just wants to be left alone for a while, it's also a nice break for viewers from his annoying family.",Null,0,0,10 May 2011
Singin' in the Rain," Wow
","I've never been a fan of musicals on film, i like going to the theater and watching a play but something about seeing it on film doesn't generally work for me. However, with that said, this film is incredible. It manages to pack everything of Hollywood's 'Golden Age' into the film, great acting, great dialog, beautiful direction and cinematography (the colors, oh the colors) and on top of that it's probably the best musical ever put on film. Now everybody knows the songs aren't original but the dance numbers are great, even the ones that you would think were less prominent (i.e. Make 'em Laugh) are better than most musical's best numbers and Donald O'Connor really steals the show with this one in my opinion. The dance number that immediately comes to mind when you think of this film is Singin' In the Rain and it definitely doesn't disappoint. Gene Kelley is an incredible dancer and he'll have you mesmerized while you watch the scene. I watched this film in my History of American Cinema class and I have a hard time arguing against it being the best of the bunch.",10,1,2,6 May 2011
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest," Nicholson's Best and a Masterpiece of American Cinema
","One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest is one of the most famous novels in American literature, it also happens to be one of the most successful adaptations in American cinema. Sweeping the major awards at the Oscars (at the time it was one of only 2 to do so) the film propelled itself into a cult classic status and has transpired through generations onto top films lists from people of all ages. Nicholson turns in what I would consider his best work in a long list of incredible performances. His supporting cast isn't too shabby either. Louise Fletcher, Will Sampson, Brad Dourif, Christopher Lloyd, Danny Devito, William Redfield and Sydney Lassick turn in brilliant performances to help craft Milos Forman's beautiful vision for this classic tale of Man vs. The System.The film is incredibly funny and at the same time stunningly compelling, heartwarming and sad. It combines these aspects so well that you're able to sympathize with characters throughout the film, hate Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) and laugh along with the patients on the ward all while rooting for our hero McMurphy (Jack Nicholson).",10,1,2,27 April 2011
